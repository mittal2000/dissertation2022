What Now?,"Octavio Salazar, ContributorProfessor of Constitutional Law, University of Cordoba",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/spain-king-abdicate_b_5433445.html,"After the surprising news this week -- which was not, in fact, surprising, given that the abdication of King Juan Carlos has long been bandied about as the most realistic way for the Spanish monarchy to bring its institutional crisis to an end -- the many questions now emerging are two-fold.",2014-06-02,"In this photo released by the Royal Palace on Monday June 2, 2014 and distributed by Spain's national agency EFE, Spain's King Juan Carlos makes a televised speech Monday in the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid announcing his abdication.

(AP Photo/Spanish Royal Palace/EFE)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1377a230000370093ce11.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After the surprising news this week -- which was not, in fact, surprising, given that the abdication of King Juan Carlos has long been bandied about as the most realistic way for the Spanish monarchy to bring its institutional crisis to an end -- the many questions now emerging are two-fold. The first, which is the purely legal-constitutional question, is the easiest to resolve, mostly because there's political will to make it happen though not particularly because our laws actually foresaw this occasion with any detail. The Spanish constitution limits itself, in Article 57.5, to asserting that, ""Abdications and renunciations and whatever question of fact or of right that occurs in the order of succession to the Crown will be resolved by organic national law."" As such, the immediate next steps will consist of the courts approving said law via, we suppose, an expedited process. Thus in many ways it will be the court system that will give the abdication its content, and will outline the processes and timeline for Prince Felipe's elevation to the throne. This urgency, however, makes manifest a problem that many of us constitutionalists have long criticized: the absence of specific regulation regarding the institutional positioning of the king, his heir, and all other possible exceptional and/or interim situations that can come up when leadership is supported through family continuity and not the electoral process. And that's not to mention the embarrassing persistence of male preference in succession to the throne, as outlined in Article 57, which our mediocre elected officials have shown neither the desire nor the courage to reform in the past more than 30 years. With the legal question resolved (which, I repeat, I do believe will be easily covered), I fear that the issue that will really linger is the whole romantic-patriotic-journalistic exaltation over the figure of the king (from whom I won't take away credit due, but nor will I overlook errors made). This may be the most important of the post-abdication issues we face. For me, as a jurist and a citizen, it's the one that sounds alarms in my democratic soul. I'm referring to the debate over the leadership of the state -- a debate that can no longer be conditional on dead weight from a historic moment. That is, arguments of import during the transition to democracy lack value, or at least lack such value, now, three decades later. This is because the increasing loss of prestige of an institution that, per se, supports itself on the excellence of its subjects or ceases to make sense, but also because political maturity demands the revision of various clauses from the 1978 Spanish constitution. Some need rethinking because they were bungled in the moment; others because they've simply been overshadowed by events over time. In the same way that some political notions that were once marginal now increasingly occupy a place in mainstream political debate, it is necessary for Spaniards to endow ourselves with a new constitutional text, one that will allow us to enshrine those ideas that, for historic reasons, we did not in 1978. Such that our constitution brings to a close a transitional dynamic that left many skeletons in the closet. Such that it truly emphasizes the well-being of the people and improved democratic participation. Such that it serves, together with other urgent and necessary reforms, to end or at least diminish the fissures that are bleeding to death a social-democratic state of law whose defining adjectives seem to matter less and less. It will be particularly rough going for Prince Felipe as he seeks to establish the legitimacy of his office (an eternal struggle for monarchies); but without it, his role will continue to grow even weaker than it is today -- in large part because he is not the heir to ""Juancarlos-ism."" But also, happily, because younger generations have learned a good part (if not all) of the rules essential to democracy. Just a stone's throw away, we've born witness to so many European elections, the results of which have served to yank off the veil that was already struggling to hide many of the system's flaws. Such it is that we enter into tumultuous and pleasurably democratic times. Because we cannot forget that democracy implies circulation of ideas, pluralism, free voices in the public square (although there are still some who don't seem to show much countenance that last idea.) Free voices that, today more than ever, have every right to question the continuity of an institution constructed on inequality and to fight peacefully using democratic weapons for the launch of a constitutional process that will bring us closer to the constitutional system for which many of us dream.This article was first published on the author's blog, Las horas.This piece was translated from Spanish and originally appeared on HuffPost Spain."
1,RELIGION,The Ghost Of Pierre Teilhard De Chardin,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teilhard-american-nuns_n_5374368.html,,2014-06-01,"UNSPECIFIED - MAY 24: Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) french priest, theologian, scientist, (Photo by Apic/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d45f8f3b00004e27ec801b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Are American nuns paying for the sins of a Jesuit priest who died in the 1950s?It might seem that way, given the ongoing showdown between doctrinal hard-liners in the Vatican and leaders representing more than 40,000 U.S. sisters, with one of Rome’s chief complaints being the nuns’ continuing embrace of the notion of “conscious evolution.”To many ears, “conscious evolution” probably sounds like a squishy catchphrase picked up after too much time in a New Age sweat lodge, and that’s pretty much how Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, head of the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, views it.The German theologian bluntly told heads of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious last month that the principles of “conscious evolution” — that mankind is transforming through the integration of science, spirituality and technology — are “opposed to Christian Revelation” and lead to “fundamental errors.”That’s tough talk, and Mueller warned them that if the nuns persist in pursuing such dangerous ideas, Rome could cut them loose.Yet those principles, and indeed the very term “conscious evolution,” also lead directly back to Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955), a French Jesuit who was by turns a philosopher and theologian, geologist and paleontologist.It was Teilhard’s thinking about humanity’s future evolution that got him in trouble with church authorities, however.Teilhard argued, for example, that creation is still evolving and that mankind is changing with it; we are, he said, advancing in an interactive “noosphere” of human thought through an evolutionary process that leads inexorably toward an Omega Point – Jesus Christ — that is pulling all the cosmos to itself.“Everything that rises must converge,” as Teilhard put it, a phrase so evocative that Flannery O’Connor appropriated it for her story collection. This process of “complexification” — another of his signature terms — is intensifying and Catholic theology could aid in that process if it, too, adapts.Now, that’s a perilously brief sketch of what is an intricate and often impenetrable series of concepts, but that language is enough to show why, as early as the 1920s, Teilhard’s Jesuit superiors barred him first from publishing and then from teaching, and then effectively exiled him to China to dig for fossils (which he did with great success).In fact, most of Teilhard’s works were not published until after his death, and in 1962 a nervous Vatican issued a formal warning about “the dangers presented by the works of Fr. Teilhard de Chardin and his followers.”Yet if few remember who Teilhard was, his views on faith and science continued to resonate, and today, remarkably, he’s actually enjoying something of a renaissance.Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, for example, who as a young theologian named Joseph Ratzinger criticized Teilhard’s views, a few years ago praised Teilhard’s “great vision” of the cosmos as a “living host.” That raised a few eyebrows and prompted Benedict’s spokesman to clarify that “by now, no one would dream of saying that (Teilhard) is a heterodox author who shouldn’t be studied.”Benedict’s successor, Pope Francis, has also invoked Teilhard-sounding concepts about the ongoing development of human consciousness, and Vatican observers say it would not be surprising if Teilhard made an appearance in an encyclical on the environment that Francis is currently writing.Teilhard “is definitely being quoted or invoked in ways we haven’t seen in decades, and really never before by the Roman magisterium,” said the Rev. Paul Crowley, a Jesuit at Santa Clara University who has studied Teilhard.Crowley said one reason for the reconsideration is that reality caught up with Teilhard’s ideas: The growing global ecological crisis is prompting demands for the kind of holistic scientific and moral response Teilhard would have endorsed, and the Internet is itself a digital “noosphere” of universal interconnectivity.At the same time, scholars such as David Grummett and Sister Elizabeth Johnson have been honing and deploying Teilhard’s often arcane ideas, and the American Teilhard Association has an agenda busy with conferences and publications. It is “the emergence of Teilhard de Chardin,” as John Haught titled a 2009 essay in Commonweal magazine.There’s even a major documentary on Teilhard in the works, with a blurb from NPR’s Cokie Roberts: “Bringing Teilhard de Chardin alive to another generation could not come at a more opportune time.”So how is it that the American nuns are getting tripped up by Teilhard just as Teilhard is becoming cool again?The problem is, as Crowley put it, that for every serious Teilhard scholar “there are nine New Age types who invoke Teilhard’s name” — and often botch the pronunciation.Granted, Teilhard remains his own worst enemy. He was as much mystic as scientist, and his concepts could be so idiosyncratic and esoteric that they fed right into the ecology-and-spirituality movement that blossomed in the 1970s and beyond. Teilhard tends to be quoted by the left the way G.K. Chesterton is cited by the right — frequently and to great effect, but often torn from any meaningful context.To be sure, Teilhard’s disciples, including author and lecturer Barbara Marx Hubbard, whose invitation to address the American nuns in 2012 continues to irk some in Rome, helped keep his legacy alive.But at this point the Catholic Church may need to take Teilhard more seriously if it is to take him back from his fan base outside traditional religion.Teilhard “needs substantive theological attention,” Crowley said. “What we need to do is to separate the gold from the dross and appropriate it in new ways.”"

(AP Photo/Seth Perlman, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cb50260000350083b746.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mass murders are becoming a depressingly familiar routine in the United States -- we can now expect to experience a media grabbing shooting about once a month. And the frequency can only increase as future cohorts of copycat killers are spawned by the seductive opportunity to temporarily gain the spotlight.Amidst the anguish and heartbreak felt by the victims' families, there are always two haunting questions. What motivates someone to kill strangers wholesale in a seemingly senseless way? And what, if anything, can we do to stop these tragedies from recurring?The accumulating large sample of mass murderers and their eagerness to explain themselves in print and videos provides a rich data base. Dr. James Knoll, a leading forensic psychiatrist with special expertise in mass murderers will describe the pattern of their demographics and psychological profiles. Dr. Knoll writes: In 2013, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) issued a report on public mass shootings. The CRS used as its working definition incidents 'occurring in relatively public places, involving four or more deaths.' The CRS identified 78 public mass shootings in the U.S. since 1983 that had resulted in 547 deaths and 1, 023 casualties. Thanks so much Dr. Knoll for clarifying our first question on the demographic and psychological factors that help explain what motivates the mass murderer.Which brings us to our second question. Now that we know what mass murderers look like, can we use this knowledge to prevent them from becoming mass murderers?For the most part, the answer is a disappointing no because it is just not possible to find needles in haystacks. Lots of people fit Dr. Knoll's demographic and psychological profile, but never act out their fantasies. We can easily predict a high-risk group, but have no way to identify the one specific person who will go haywire, and when it will happen. To prevent the act of the killer who winds up pulling the trigger, we would have to seriously violate the civil rights of the hundreds of thousands of others who resemble him, but turn out to be harmless. Mass murders happen way too often for us to tolerate, but way too rarely to be easily preventable by identifying and isolating the mass murderers. We can't possibly jail or hospitalize everyone who has violent fantasies. The best we can hope for is to reduce access to weapons of mass destruction. It shouldn't be easier for a potential killer to get a gun than get an outpatient appointment. We need to improve both sides of this equation. More treatment, fewer guns. The only good outcome of the mass murder epidemic has been an increased awareness that mental health treatment is woefully underfunded and inaccessible to most people who desperately need it. It often takes months to get an outpatient appointment and beds are so few that getting into a psychiatric hospital is almost impossible. Improving accessibility to mental health services is a national necessity and may help prevent an occasional tragedy -- but it is only a very partial and totally inadequate answer. The much more effective step is a responsible gun control policy that balances the civil rights of individuals with the safety of the public. It is no surprise that a majority of the population (including a majority of gun owners) favors measures that would restrict high-risk individuals from having such easy access to guns. The only surprise is that the majority of reasonable people can be held hostage by the minority radical faction of the NRA, by the free spending arms makers who sponsor it, and by craven politicians. For a balanced analysis of the civil rights issues that should be considered in framing a fair, safe, common sense gun control policy, see this article.The way forward is clear -- we need to reduce free access to guns for those individuals who are at high risk to use them irresponsibly. Undoubtedly, this will eventually happen as the mass murders continue to pile up. Sooner or later, public outrage will overcome the NRA radicals and push politicians to do their job. But how much more blood must be spilled before simple common sense prevails over extreme ideology."
3,IMPACT,The Global Search for Education: Ticks - More from Norway,"C. M. Rubin, ContributorBlogger and author, 'The Real Alice in Wonderland'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-global-search-for-edu_b_5425169.html,,2014-06-01,2014-05-31-cmrubinworldrichardhorowitzcathyrubinsiwhansson500.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-31-cmrubinworldrichardhorowitzcathyrubinsiwhansson500-thumb.jpg," C.M. Rubin, Dr. Richard Horowitz, and Siw Hansson at the  NorVect Global Tick-borne Diseases Conference in OsloComplicated problems usually have many dimensions and require multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary strategies to solve them. We talk about this approach in global 21st century education reform all the time, but we live in a world that sometimes forgets the lessons.One of my loved ones became seriously ill in 2006 with joint pains, vertigo, memory loss and chronic fatigue. Two years of assessments for diseases ensued, including Parkinson's, ALS, Alzheimer's, Lyme disease, Fibromyalgia, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Depression, and various cancers. Ultimately, a doctor knowledgeable about Lyme and co-infections diagnosed him, recommending holistic care from a neurologist, a rheumatologist and an internist, while also focusing on improving his psychological health, his nutrition and his lifestyle.Since this experience, I've felt tremendous compassion for all who have to endure this devastating illness. How can we better defend them? I've imagined a round table like King Arthur's that would bring together the brave knights of medical science as well as passionate tick-borne disease advocates to harness the expertise of all; to explore, to uncover through honorable discussion how to find the holy grail: better diagnostic tools and ultimately a cure for multi-systemic tick-borne infections.Timing is everything. The incidence of Lyme and other tick borne co-infections is rising in more than 65 countries worldwide -- diseases that are plagued by inadequate tests leading many to believe there are still millions of undiagnosed cases. Research progress is slow because of disagreements on the unanswered questions related to diagnosis and treatment. Interestingly, more scientific voices are now expressing the opinion that clues lie in the disease's similarity to syphilis and its ability to become chronic.   According to the CDC, chronic disease accounts for 70% of the deaths and 75% of the health care costs in the United States. Nip a potentially chronic disease in the bud and you are ahead of the game. Hesitate to take action and you're facing enormous healthcare debt.The talented women who run the NorVect organization have taken some major steps forward. They held an impressive global vector-borne conference this past week in Norway (which has seen a ten-fold increase in incidence in parts of the country during the past year). This extremely well attended forum was kicked off with an inspiring speech by the Norwegian Liberal Party Leader, Trine Skei Grande. I felt honored to co-host the proceedings.  ""We need to understand the method for making a clinical diagnosis and talk about the management of treatment protocol."" - Dr. Joe BurrascanoAnd so there were the knights of NorVect's round table gathered to begin the conversation. Some highlights:""Bartonella species are causing disease in animals and people in North America and throughout the world. They can induce persistent intravascular infection in humans that spans months to years, potentially resulting in vascular rheumatic and neurological disease manifestations."" - Dr. Ed Breitschwerdt""Borrelia Burgdorferi does form a very organized biofilm. It provides a refuge from anti-microbial treatment. Preliminary results show borrelia biofilm in infected human tissues."" - Dr. Eva Sapi""BB complex bacteria are transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks. These ticks also carry and transmit other pathogens such as Babesia, Ehrlichia, Bartonella, and Rickettsia species and viruses."" - Dr. Jyotsna Shah""The complexity of Borrelia impacts the management of Borreliosis. We need to understand the method for making a clinical diagnosis and talk about the management of treatment protocol. Knowledge of Borrelia growth patterns can assist in making treatment decisions."" - Dr. Joe Burrascano.""We still do not know the cause of the long term complaints after treated neuroborreliosis. There are several hypotheses. Is there a continuing infection? Are there permanent scars in the nervous tissue? What about auto-immunity? Immunological and metabolic dysregulation? Psychological issues? What about co-infections? There is still a lot to discuss and to explore."" - Dr. Randi Eikeland""Treating all 3 forms of Borrelia, the agent of Lyme disease, while addressing biofilms, co-infections, inflammation, immune dysfunction, hormonal abnormalities, heavy metals, neurotoxins, sleep disorders, food sensitivities, Autonomic Nervous System dysfunction and nutritional deficiencies that are the most commonly found abnormalities on the Multi Systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome map, have the greatest impact on patients regaining health."" - Dr. Richard Horowitz""Most of the IDSA recommendations are based on expert opinion and are not evidence based. Serologic methods done according to IDSA and EUCALB guidelines are insufficient methods to rely upon. There are probably millions of patients around the world who remain undiagnosed with Lyme and co-infections. In the near future, new genomic methods will allow the detection of a new pathogenic Borrelia species (like Borrelia Miyamotoi) and allow a better identification of various microbial agents responsible for co-infections."" - Dr. Christian Perrone ""Please think of the patients who are anxious and who suffer, and also of the medical teams."" - Dr. Bela Bozsik""The current CDC guidelines for diagnosing Lyme disease involve serological tests for Borrelia Burgdorferi (Borrelia-Immunoblot/Western blot testings) which show a very weak sensitivity of just around 60% in chronic Lyme disease and cannot help regarding the question of an active infection. Is Borrelia-Elispot a game changer in diagnostics? The sensitivity of ELISPOT is estimated at 84%, and the specificity is 94%. ELISPOT assays provide robust, highly reproducible data and can be retested for the acquisition of additional information in follow-up assays."" - Dr. Armin Schwarzbach""Borrelia is involved in illnesses like Alzheimers, ALS and MS."" - Dr. Alan MacDonald""It is important to develop microscope methods to detect blood infections - it is simple and it is cheaper."" - Dr. Carl Morten Laane""A substantial amount of evidence definitely shows that the main tertiary forms of neurosyphilis, namely the meningovascular (cerebral infarcts secondary to chronic vasculitis) and meningoencephalitic forms, also occur in Lyme disease. These two major forms of late/chronic Lyme neuroborreliosis were pathologically confirmed. We reported the first pathological confirmation of the meningovascular form of Lyme neuroborreliosis in 1990 and the meningoencephalitic form was described and pathologically confirmed by many authors. Borrelia burgdorferi was repeatedly detected and/or cultivated from tertiary brain lesions. These evidences together indicate that chronic Lyme disease exists, and similarly to Treponema pallidum in syphilis, Borrelia burgdorferi is responsible for the tertiary manifestations of the disease. Late Lyme disease is accepted by all guidelines in the US and Europe. The terms late and chronic both define tertiary Lyme disease, therefore the use of chronic Lyme disease as a different entity is inaccurate and confusing."" - Dr. Judith Miklossy""Please think of the patients who are anxious and who suffer, and also of the medical teams."" - Dr. Bela Bozsik""The increased risk of infection due to the increased number of ticks carrying tick-borne infections may reduce the life quality of people in our region by preventing people from visiting forests and recreation areas.

The new video purports to show dozens of abducted schoolgirls, covered in jihab and praying in Arabic. It is the first public sight of the girls since more than 300 were kidnapped from a northeastern school the night of April 14 exactly four weeks ago. (AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e7ab210000d601c9196f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NAIROBI, Kenya (RNS) In the days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, al-Qaida became a household name. But today, other extremist Islamist groups, many in Africa, are vying for headlines.Recently, the group Boko Haram gained international infamy after it abducted more than 250 schoolgirls. Since 2009, Christians in northern Nigeria have borne the brunt of Boko Haram violence, which has included attacks on churches, schools and government installations.Now Libyan Christian leaders fear Boko Haram could spread its influence into their country as a result of a renegade former general’s campaign to purge the chaotic country of Islamist militants.But Africa is home to several other extremist groups.In the Central African Republic on Wednesday (May 28), a group known as the Seleka militia attacked a Catholic church in the capital, Bangui, where Christians were seeking refuge, killing at least 30 people.The group emerged in September 2012, and the following year it rampaged through the country, attacking churches and missions, before overthrowing the government in March 2013. The group has since lost ground and is now involved in a cycle of revenge attacks against the pro-Christian anti-Balaka rebel group.Somalia’s al-Shabaab has claimed attacks on churches, public places and public transportation in East Africa. The group, which got its start in 2006, began escalating the number of attacks in Kenya in 2011 when that country sent its troop to Somalia to fight the Islamists. Last week, al-Shabaab said it was shifting its war to Kenya.Extremist groups are not unique to Africa, said Jesse Mugambi, a professor in the University of Nairobi’s department of philosophy and religious studies. Al-Qaida-related groups are on the rise in Syria and Yemen, among other spots.“They arise whenever and wherever there are serious discontents which complainants consider unaddressed or ignored,” said Mugambi. “Religion is sometimes exploited as a tool to attract attention even when the main complaint is not religious.”He added: “In the long run, other opportunistic groups take advantage of such chaos — making it difficult to tell who is aggrieved and who is not. Religion is then blamed for the disturbance, in general, although the majority of citizens remain law-abiding.”"

Sheikh al-Mutlaq, speaking on a local Saudi radio show, warned that ""the devil would be present when women talk to men"" and urged women not to talk to males, even if the purpose of the discussion is to obtain guidance and advice. Social media aficionados Ali Jaber and Mona Bou Samra (Abu-Fadil)A jarring contrast to this year's Arab Media Forum organized by the Dubai Press Club with an agenda focusing on where media are heading, sedition, sectarianism, and whether the proverbial Arab Spring had become an Arab Autumn.""Autumn is a loaded word,"" insisted Mamoun Fandi, director of the London-based Global Strategy Institute, noting that non-government media in his native Egypt were not private or truly independent since their shares were not sold on the stock market.   Mamoun Fandi (Abu-Fadil)Co-panelist Abdallah Shaiji, chair of Kuwait University's political science department, said there was media chaos in the Arab world following revolts of the past three-plus years.""Children, not just youth, are using media: all you need is initiative,"" said Mohamad Al Hammadi, editor in chief of the United Arab Emirates daily Al Ittihad. This initiative is driving legacy media to seek innovative ways to reach audiences across a proliferation of platforms and formats, with increasing reliance on digital and virtual newsrooms. Enter the Arab world's first futuristic intelligent newsroom inaugurated at the forum where journalists can replace telephones and writing tools with touch screens and video walls to collect, curate, edit and disseminate their reports. Future digital newsroom in Dubai (Abu-Fadil)Egypt's president-elect Abdel Fattah El Sisi also made an indirect appearance at the event where participants flocked to see and meet his biggest cheerleader.The woman made famous by a viral YouTube video in mangled English dubbed ""Shut Up Your Mouse Obama,"" slamming U.S. President Barack Obama for backing deposed Egyptian president Mohamad Morsi, and praising Sisi, created a buzz when she appeared at the convention. Shut Up Your Mouse Obama's Mona Al Beheiri (Abu-Fadil)A participant in one session, echoing other members of the audience who felt Mona Al Beheiry didn't belong in the gathering of media professionals, referred to the woman as uneducated and a poor example of ""new media's"" marginalization of traditional outlets.To which Al Beheiri objected saying she may not be well educated but had every right to express her views. A talk show host later said the woman capitalized on being in the spotlight by demanding $300 per TV interview.Another key issue at the forum was online incitement to violence along religious lines and via mushrooming Arab satellite channels and ways to control, or minimize, it. ""Sectarian sedition is the greatest danger to the Arab world,"" said Mustafa Agha, an anchor on the Saudi-owned MBC channel, adding that whoever speaks the truth to criticize it pays a price. Mustafa Agha on sectarian sedition (Abu-Fadil)An editorial in Dubai-based Gulf News said experts and observers had expressed concern about extremist political groups' growing ability to spread insurrectionary messages and exhortations through the virtual world.""While laws and government regulations have a role to play in containing this contagion, what will restore the equilibrium between cyber wars and real-world resolutions for peace is heightened awareness among the youth and women on the machinations of the virtual world,"" it said.Various panelists openly criticized Qatar's Aljazeera network for fomenting trouble in the region and backing Egypt's outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.Conspicuously absent from this year's forum were Aljazeera editors, anchors and correspondents who had previously spoken at the event or presented prizes at its Arab Journalism Award ceremony capping the two-day extravaganza.A session entitled ""Qualifications: Pretty Face"" stirred a hornets' nest of comments, among five attractive female TV presenters on the panel as well as the audience, on whether beauty queens' and supermodels' looks trumped qualifications as anchors or light fare stars. Lebanese TV star Nadine Njeim (Abu-Fadil)""Some people think if a woman is beautiful she can't be intelligent, and I'm against this portrayal and persecution,"" opined Nadine Njeim, a former Miss Lebanon who appears on a popular TV show, noting that her looks hadn't barred her from setting up an IT company, speaking four languages, and acquiring two university degrees.Other sessions included discussions on the future of media in general and news in particular, as well as a workshop tying academic offerings and achievements to the job market."

""These accusations are wrong and go against the standards of international relations.""The exchange between the world's three biggest economies at the Shangri-La Dialog in Singapore, a security forum for government officials, military officers and defense experts, were among the most caustic in years at diplomatic gatherings, and could be a setback to efforts to bring ties back on track.It was the first such major conference since tensions have surged in the South China Sea, one of Asia's most intractable disputes and a possible flashpoint for conflict.Tellingly, despite around 100 bilateral and trilateral meetings taking place over the week, officials from China and Japan did not sit down together.China's Wang had rejected an offer of talks with Japan and said: ""This will hinge on whether the Japanese side is willing to amend the erroneous policy towards China and improve relations between China and Japan. Japan should correct its mistakes as soon as possible to improve China-Japan ties.""Wang later accused the United States of hegemonism, threats and intimidation.China claims almost the entire oil- and gas-rich South China Sea, and dismisses competing claims from Taiwan, Brunei, Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia. Japan has its own territorial row with China over islands in the East China Sea.Riots broke out in Vietnam last month after China placed an oil rig in waters claimed by Hanoi, and the Philippines said Beijing could be building an airstrip on a disputed island.Tensions have been rising steadily in the East China Sea as well. Japan's defense ministry said Chinese SU-27 fighters came as close as 50 meters (170 ft) to a Japanese OP-3C surveillance plane near disputed islets last week and within 30 meters of a YS-11EB electronic intelligence aircraft.On Sunday, Wang stepped up the rhetoric.""Mr Abe, as the head of a country and as someone the organizers have invited to give a speech, is supposed to stick to the event's aim in boosting security in the Asia Pacific region,"" he said. ""However Mr Abe went against the aim of the event by instigating disputes.""Despite the heated words, analysts do not believe relations have deteriorated beyond reach.""In the past, there was a sense we were sailing towards stability,"" said Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.""Now people worry. Overall, things are going in the right direction. Nobody thinks there will be war, but there is a level of unease which is new.""JAPAN'S COMING OUTChina has been particularly aggrieved by Japan trying to woo Southeast Asia.In his keynote address to the conference, Abe pitched his plan for Japan to take on a bigger international security role and said Tokyo would offer its ""utmost support"" to Southeast Asian countries in their efforts to protect their seas and airspace. It is part of his nationalist agenda to loosen the restraints of the pacifist post World War Two constitution and to shape a more muscular Japanese foreign policy.Philip Hammond, the British defense minister, said Abe's agenda was well know but provoked a response because it was laid out publicly.""It's certainly the first time I had heard him articulate it on a public platform in that way,"" he said.Japan's growing proximity to Washington is also a worry for Beijing.""What really worries them is that Japan and the U.S. are in a very strong alliance and seem to be pulling closer, that was clear at this year's dialog,"" said Tim Huxley, executive director of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in Asia, the organizer of the forum.""Rightly or wrongly, that will be seen by the Chinese as threatening them because it will mean they will be facing a more coherent alliance.""Still, the row is not likely to spill over. The three nations have deep economic and business ties, which none of them would like to see disrupted.""Relations are definitely not at a breaking point,"" said Bonnie Glaser of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies and a regular visitor to the dialog.""Leaders are aware that their countries have huge stakes in this relationship and they are committed to trying to find areas where interests do overlap, where they can work together.""Beijing, she said, had compartmentalized various aspects of its relationship with Japan and the United States. ""There is a wider strategy from China, though we don't see that here, partly because it's a security forum.""William Cohen, a former U.S. secretary for defense, said the strong words from the United States and Japan were necessary.""China is growing, it's maturing, it's also feeling its oats a bit and throwing its weight around. That is normal if they see no counterweight. It's incumbent upon us to say, okay, there are limits. These things have to be said.""

Sadly for them, the FT's claims proved untrue.",2014-06-01,"French economist Thomas Piketty attends during a meeting at the National Assembly on March 13, 2013 in Paris. AFP PHOTO / FRED DUFOUR (Photo credit should read FRED DUFOUR/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cb73200000f90101cf5e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Conservatives in all corners of the globe must have felt their hearts sing, if only for a moment, when the Financial Times ran a piece entitled ""Piketty findings undercut by errors."" Sadly for them, the FT's claims proved untrue. But if you think that put an end to the accusations against the French economist and his findings on inequality, you don't know today's conservatives.We're not going to re-litigate the charges against Thomas Piketty, whose book Capital in the Twenty-First Century has galvanized the global debate on inequality. The case for the defense has already been made rather conclusively -- by Mike Konczal, Paul Krugman, Mark Gongloff and Piketty himself.The Guardian's Peter Mason went so far as to suggest, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that the FT's poorly-constructed attack might have something to do with a Times advertising supplement geared to the 0.001 percent. Wrote Mason: ""if (FT author Peter) Giles is right, then all the gross designer bling advertised in the FT's How To Spend It can be morally justified.""Needless to say, conservatives seized on the FT's overhyped charges without any evidence that they paused to consider the argument they were endorsing. Even before the FT's mistakes were brought to light, it was apparent to the attentive reader that its critique addressed only a minor aspect of Piketty's findings. It had little to do with the central thesis of an author the paper called a ""rock-star economist.""Then it turned out that Piketty's on-line appendices addressed many of the paper's concerns, and that the Financial Times itself made some mistakes (including relying on untrustworthy survey data). What was left were ""questions,"" rather than ""errors,"" as Piketty observed. It's true that we need more and better data on inequality, as Piketty and others acknowledge. (That's one of his arguments in favor of a global wealth tax.) But there were no math errors, no typing mistakes and no spreadsheet errors -- only a compelling thesis which effectively compiled data from a number of sources, and whose calculations and assumptions were made readily available.Move along, folks. Nothing to see here.That's not to say that journalists and critics shouldn't question the work of economists and other technical experts, whether they're ""rock stars"" or not. In that sense, the FT was doing its job. The FT's mistake was in sensationalizing its findings and promoting them as something they were not. That's an irresponsible thing to do -- especially in a world where extremists and powerful special interests will seize on any scrap of information, however inaccurate, to discredit facts which undercut their arguments.The FT's over-hyping may have sold some newspapers, but it did not burnish the paper's reputation.The Right wasted no time seizing the opportunity the FT gave them. By the time the FT's mistakes and exaggerations had been pointed out, a number of conservatives had embraced the article and were pushing it aggressively. They felt no responsibility to amend what they had written when new information came to light.As a result, the lie lives on in the hard right. Even now the right-wing Twitterverse features a seemingly unending stream of snide comments about ""Piketty fraud"" and ""Piketty errors,"" despite the fact that neither phenomenon has been discovered in the real world. ""What is interesting about #Piketty,"" said one recent tweet, ""is to observe those prepared to defend the condescending fraud."" Another says ""Thomas Piketty is a fraud. Was proven a fraud just days ago.""There have even been snide right-wing comments comparing Piketty's work to that of the climate-change scientists the Right has worked so hard to discredit. That was predictable -- nearly as predictable, in fact, as man-made climate change itself.There are, in fact, parallels between the false Piketty ""scandal' and the Right's phony climate change conspiracy theories. In the cynical world of bought-and-paid-for public policy thinking, there are politicians, pundits and think tanks that are all too happy to engage in a kind of ""pay to play"" debate. These pay-as-you-go partisans have managed to convince a minority of the American people that thousands of scientists are engage in a secret conspiracy to deprive them of the right to bankrupt themselves with gas-guzzling vehicles and vote for politicians who serve the interests of people much wealthier than themselves.They are joined in this effort but easily excitable, emotionally-driven partisans who find it somehow satisfied to stick it to an imaginary ""liberal elite"" with extreme and erroneous arguments. While the people they persuade are (and probably always will be) a minority, it's a sizable enough minority to make meaningful action on climate change extremely difficult.Economics is not a hard science like climate research. Nevertheless, there are certain facts which reputable members of the profession do not dispute. To be a denialist -- to deny the existence of evidence that is right in front of you -- is to engage in a kind of fraud.There are honorable ways to disagree, and there are dishonorable ways to disagree. The honorable approach was taken by Patrick Brennan of the National Review. To be sure, I think Brennan reaches the wrong conclusions, and that he exaggerates the problems with Piketty's normalization of data from multiple sources. But at least he had the integrity to deny the overheated charges of ""fraud"" coming from so many on the right. Good for him.The dishonorable approach was taken by righty outlets like the Power Line blog, where one writer responded to the FT report by comparing Piketty's work to the ""Piltdown Man"" hoax. There have been no corrections or retractions of this statement. Similarly, British blogger Thomas Fraser claimed that the FT had uncovered ""corruptions in (Piketty's) data"" which was ""shocking because the errors are so basic,"" and that ""on this, Piketty has built a manifesto for all kinds of tax rises."" Fraser expresses outrage toward Piketty's publishers at Harvard University Press for failing to spot these ""errors"" and ""corruptions.""All of these claims have now been conclusively disproven but, as of this writing, Fraser has not issued an update or correction either. (One is tempted to chide his ""publishers"" at the Spectator website.)Thomas Piketty is not above criticism. We had a few points of disagreement with him in our own review of his book, and we interviewed Dean Baker about his disagreements with Piketty. Robert Kuttner explored ""what Piketty leaves out,"" and Thomas Frank noted that Piketty missed the historical effectiveness of organized workers in reducing inequality. (That said, I imagine that all of the left-leaning critics listed above appreciate Piketty's many contributions to the inequality debate, both in this book and in earlier research.)Conservatives aren't obligated to accept the defenses of Piketty, either, however persuasive many of us find them. But to ignore them altogether, to hype the FT's attack and omit such exhaustively researched and data-rich rebuttals, is to conduct an indefensible cherry-picking of both facts and arguments.And that, ironically, is what the Financial Times wrongly accused Piketty of doing.Conservatives can claim that the progressive solutions which worked so well in the past won't work today. They can argue, as libertarian Garrett Jones does, that ""the best way to defuse the situation is to teach tolerance for inequality. "" They can even continue to promote the disproven solutions of the past, as a new book from Arthur Laffer et al. does. (It won laudatory blurbs from Dick Cheney and Phil Gramm, if that tells you anything.)That's how honest debate works -- or should. We should all be willing to hawk our wares in the marketplace of ideas. But to distort the facts or make false accusations is to poison that marketplace with tainted goods. When conservatives do it as a matter of routine -- on economics, climate change and so many other issues -- it also sends the subliminal message that they don't believe they can win an argument on its merits.Encouraging more conservatives to engage in honorable debate may seem like an overly ambitious goal. But, hey, they got me to say something nice about the National Review, so anything's possible."

Some companies generate significant revenue per employee that runs into the millions of dollars. Others generate only a fraction of that. While it can suggest a company is struggling, many companies with lower revenue per employee thrive with employees that appear to be less productive.  In many instances, these companies are in the restaurant and hospitality industries. For example, McDonald’s paid the average crew members and cashiers only slightly more than the $7.25 per hour minimum wage, according to employee-submitted data from Glassdoor.com, an online career community.A number of these businesses depend largely on labor from overseas. Such businesses include Amphenol, which produces electronic and fiber optic cables, and Cognizant, which offers IT outsourcing services. Often, such companies use foreign labor to provide low costs for their own businesses, as well as pass along cost savings to their clients.Just because a company has relatively low revenue per employee does not mean it will stop hiring. As long as adding more employees continues to be profitable — returning more money to the company than it costs to find, train and pay a worker — businesses have an incentive to keep adding workers. A number of companies where the per-employee revenue is relatively low, such as O’Reilly Automotive and Starbucks, added a considerable number of jobs last year.Based on figures from S&P Capital IQ, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the companies with the lowest revenue per employee. In order to be consistent, we used net revenue figures as reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Employee totals used in this analysis are based on S&P Capital IQ measure of full-time equivalent employees. In some instances, S&P Capital IQ employee totals may include franchisee workers, a large part-time or hourly labor force, or a largely foreign-based workforce. We also reviewed financial information published in company presentations, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and metrics calculated by Morningstar. Darden Restaurants was excluded from this analysis, due to the recent divestiture of its Red Lobster chain.These are the 10 companies with the least valuable workers."

Those still calling for military action love to draw parallels with Churchill's early and unyielding opposition to Hitler during the run-up to World War II. They are, however, citing the wrong Churchillian chapter (and verse).Look not at 1938 but at 1919. Churchill's words and deeds regarding Russia in its post-Revolutionary chaos after World War One are the key. As Secretary of State for War in the war's immediate aftermath, Churchill desperately wanted Great Britain to stop ""Bolshevism"" militarily by supporting the anti-Bolshevik forces battling what was essentially the newly-Bolshevized Russian army. Did he support military intervention? Yes, but with powerful reservations. Might he have sent in British troops today? Never. Would he have rallied Europe and America to jointly send troops? Conceivably. As a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, he might well have embraced economic sanctions as the most powerful weapon he could wield against Putin. After all, Churchill's greatest non-military priority in 1919 was to dissuade the British government from officially recognizing the Communist regime and beginning to trade with it. (In this, he failed. Britain resumed commerce with Russia in May 1920).What Churchill never would have done would be to mistake Vladimir Putin invading the Crimea for Adolf Hitler invading the Sudetenland. Churchill understood power and the difference between a grasping despot and an epically-fortified dictator poised to take over the world.Churchill stood up to Communism long before he stood up to Nazism. And with good reason, though with far greater nuance. In a letter that he drafted to Prime Minister David Lloyd George in February 1919 (but did not ultimately send), Churchill's prognostication for Russia's future resonates with our own moment to a disconcerting degree:Russia will certainly rise again, perhaps very swiftly, as a great united empire determined to maintain the integrity of her dominions and to recover everything that has been taken away from her. While this process is going on, Europe will be in a perpetual state of ferment. The belt of little States we are now calling into being will be quaking with terror and no doubt misconducting themselves in every possible way.Britain, ""ought to...try and keep alive the Russian forces which were attempting to make headway against the Bolsheviks,"" Churchill proclaimed at a War Cabinet meeting on February 12. Lloyd George, however, resisted (and even belittled) Churchill's advocacy. While leaving in place the 14,000-or so British troops already on the ground in Russia (a remnant from the Great War), Lloyd George refused to send reinforcements, or further armaments, or even very much in the way of orders.This was not Winston Churchill's style. More than anything, Churchill wanted a coherent plan laid out for Great Britain in Russia. ""It seems to me most urgent for us to frame and declare our policy,"" he had written to Lloyd George in a letter that was sent on January 27. Evacuate at once at all costs' is a policy; it is not a very pleasant one from the point of view of history. 'Reinforce and put the job through' is a policy; but unhappily we have not the power. ...Therefore, we must confine ourselves to modest limits. At present we are extending our commitments, curtailing our contributions, and not even maintaining our own men.In fact, Churchill believed the Western Powers, as one, should declare war on the Bolsheviks. For this, however, he found virtually no support anywhere. Absent such a declaration of war, Churchill accepted that evacuating the remaining British forces and leaving Russia to its fate was inescapable. But Churchill knew that fate could be influenced. He demanded a strategic design for Britain's withdrawl, with a substantial investment of arms and money left behind to bolster the anti-Bolsheviks, after British troops were gone.Churchill wrote to Lloyd George on March 14:You and President Wilson have, I fear, definitely closed your minds on this subject and appear resolved to let Russian affairs take their course...You are the masters and you may, of course, be right...It is my duty, however, to warn you of the profound misgiving with which I watch the steady degeneration of so many resources and powers which, vigorously used, might entirely have altered the course of events...We shall nevertheless be drawn, in spite of all your intentions, into the clutches of the Russian problem...and we shall then bewail the loss of much that is now slipping through our fingers unheeded.Churchill's take on the Ukraine, specifically, is fascinating and echoes instructively. ""Profiting by the fact that German troops were rapidly withdrawn after the Armistice, and no other ordered force took their place, [the Bolshevik armies] advanced rapidly and overran the whole of the Ukraine,"" Churchill told the House of Commons in a speech on March 26. (How familiar this sounds.) The Ukraine, Churchill added bemusedly, ""has not yet fully experienced the joy of Bolshevik rule and therefore the people are to some extent under the first influence of the disease."" Yet, even as he advocated waging war on Bolshevism, Churchill remained painfully prudent about the delicacy of attacking any part of Russia, particularly the Ukraine, warning the West against any ""rash interference or meddling, which would enable the Bolsheviks to rally to themselves perhaps even a patriotic movement.""""The Bolsheviks destroy wherever they exist,"" he concluded, before the assembled MPs. ""By rolling forward into fertile areas, like the vampire which sucks the blood from his victims, they gain the means of prolonging their own baleful existence.""The point is that Churchill, while possessing a terrible clarity about the carnage that a Bolshevik Russia would ultimately wreak, understood the trickiness of attempting to seize unpleasant events in Russia and bend them to the West's will. ""It would not be right for us to send out armies..."" he acknowledged in a speech in London on April 11, 1919. ""If Russia is to be saved, it must be by Russian manhood, but all our hearts are with these men...in their splendid struggle to restore the honour of muted Russia, to rebuild on a modern and democratic basis the freedom, prosperity, and happiness of its trusted and good-hearted people.""Ninety-five years later the world again (or, perhaps, still) watches and waits. For almost a century, ""Russian manhood"" has not had a particularly good time of it restoring the honour of ""muted Russia."" With Churchill's help they might have had their best chance in 1919. With Churchill's wisdom we might yet help them now.Books by Barry Singer:   "
