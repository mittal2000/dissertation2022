This little tropical realm has put away the constrained thinking that keeps others stuck in unproductive routines, and allowed its wildness to escape the margins.",2014-01-29,2014-01-28-HondurasBlueMorphoButterflyJamesAdams.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-01-28-HondurasBlueMorphoButterflyJamesAdams-thumb.jpg,"Honduras is like the monkey who locked up the zookeeper. This little tropical realm has put away the constrained thinking that keeps others stuck in unproductive routines, and allowed its wildness to escape the margins.Because it's faithful to our childlike imaginations of wilderness, our youthful notions of life authentic and unadulterated, Honduras remains a true, original adventure. Far from the strictures of gentlemanly routines, here we can remember what makes life rip-roaring and breathtaking. We can test our mettle, hear our hearts race, and even encounter a bit of danger. This is a world painted in bold, unrepentant strokes: where monkeys howl, parrots and macaws swoop over waterfalls, and the white water of life can splash you in the face.So it is I head down to stay at one of the most delicious eco-lodges in the Americas, the Lodge at Pico Bonito. The owners designed it as an eco-destination that demonstrates that a forest left standing is a much more valuable, more sustainable, source of income to the community than one cut down. The lodge employs only local residents, uses community suppliers, and is committed to environmentally sound practices. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't keep your eyes open.The cabin to which I am assigned is on the edge of the jungle, with louvered and screened windows, two ceiling fans, and a private veranda with a hammock. Delightful. But the first night I can't sleep because the sounds from the rainforest are so loud and continuous. So, the next day I ask if I might move to a cabin closer to the lodge, hoping it might be a bit quieter. I tuck my passport and wallet at the bottom of my pack, leave my key with a bellboy, and take off for a day rafting down the nearby Rio Cangreja.  Photo courtesy of the Lodge at Pico BonitoFlowing from deep within the rainforest of the Pico Bonito National Park down to the Caribbean, the 20-mile river is sliced with moments of agreeable horror (called rapids,) between pools of calm. In the quiet sections the waters are so still they image the clouds. I paddle at the pace of the clouds, a cadence that seems to reach back to the first blush of life on the planet; purer than the rhythms of childhood. The sandy banks are rippled with three-toed sloths and iguanas. Jaguars keep furtive watch from behind broad leaves. Wild plants and fruit grow in abandon, nourishing legions of insects and the self-propelled flowers they call butterflies, of which there are some 40 species here, including the stunning blue morpho.  Photo courtesy of the Lodge at Pico BonitoThere is a magical realism about this river, a complex system of layering. It seems a place to grasp the mystery that breathes behind things.That evening I return to the lodge, and retire to my new, quieter cabin. My luggage has been moved, and set up near the bed. Everything is wonderful. Photo courtesy of the Lodge at Pico BonitoI spend several more satisfying days exploring the environs. The park unwinds with a well-maintained network of trails, and exploring them is like hiking through a grand green cathedral, at once hallowed, sublime, and a bit eerie. Life is exuberant and pure here. I can almost inhale the incense of life surrounded by massive ropes of vines, hanging moss, and fairy chains of orchids. It is like a hall of double helixes, creating life as the woodland umbilicals swung.At one time Honduras, like all of Central America, was part of the ocean floor and the earliest volcanoes swelled beneath the sea. As layer after upon layer of cooled volcanic material piled up, peaks finally poked from the watery depths. This rapturously terrible geological activity is key to the country's lush landscape and astonishing biodiversity. Honduras is the arm that reaches two continents; it is, in many ways, the ark of Latin America. It holds a mind-bending amount of ecological variety. Pico Bonito's profusion of wildlife thrives on an equally staggering range of vegetation, including at least four different kinds of forest, encompassing some 500 species of trees. It's like every color of the rainbow, with a few new ones thrown in for good measure.There are so many birds in Pico Bonito the tropic breeze seems like fire, brilliant with color. Orchids grow like kudzu. Tiny frogs, hop like raindrops. Here is a supple universe. Here water conquers stone.  Photo courtesy of the Lodge at Pico BonitoAt the end of my stay, I go to tip the staff and pull out my wallet to distribute some cash. As I dig in the leather folds I find less cash than I remember carrying down, but still enough to show ample gratitude. I puzzle for a minute about my miscalculation, but then think nothing more about it. A few weeks later, back in the States, I get a call from Visa. The representative asks if I just purchased a convertible Mustang in Honduras. ""What? I returned over a month ago."" The rep then goes through my buying history, showing an ever-increasing trail and price-tag of purchases on my card, beginning with gas, moving to meals, then clothes, and ending up with my car acquisition. After some investigation, it turns out the bellboy, while moving my luggage, had rifled through my walled and taken some cash, and a little-used credit card in the back. I didn't even notice it was gone until the call.As the ultimate conservationist, the bellboy wanted to keep as much as possible in-country... including my credit card.Now I own a convertible mustang in La Ceiba, so if in the neighborhood, let me know. Would love to have your enjoy a ride. "
1,PARENTING,The President's State of the Union Message to Parents: Invest When the Children Are Young,"Avidan Milevsky, Contributor

Obama vowed to reverse a tide of economic inequality threatening the American dream Tuesday, seeking to outflank Republicans and revive a second term blighted by self-inflicted wounds and partisan warfare. In his annual State of the Union address, Obama promised to wield his executive powers in a 'year of action' to lift up workers, improve education and clean the environment if his foes in Congress balk at more sweeping action. AFP PHOTO/Jewel Samad (Photo credit should read JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dd2f72200005700d9c702.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the many initiatives proposed by President Obama in his State of the Union address was to focus on early childhood education. Children with a quality pre-school education are more likely to succeed in later schooling with potential life-long benefits. The importance of focusing on young children in school is unfortunately not always mirrored by what parents do at home. When my oldest daughter was about 2 years old, my wife and I were beginning to realize why developmental psychologists referred to this age as the ""terrible twos."" In addition to challenging our authority and insisting on doing things her own way, she was adamant about following her own eating and sleeping schedule. For a while, she was waking up at 4 a.m. and would head to the playroom, making sure not to wake us, for several hours of undisturbed play time. She also had a habit of lying whenever some mischief occurred in the house and would insist that ""I didn't do it"" even though she was an only child at the time. Frustrated, I commented to a friend how challenging parenting was. His response to my complaint was ""This is nothing, just wait until she becomes a teenager, that's when you become a real parent."" I spent quite some time thinking about his response and began realizing that this is exactly the problem with parenting today. For some reason, many believe that the real challenge of parenting emerges during the adolescent stage -- when things get really difficult. Before that point not much thought needs to be placed into parenting practices. No one would suggest that we focus on quality education only once children reach high school. President Obama's call for excellent early childhood education, at least from an educational standpoint, is not really challenged. Yet when it comes to parenting, many take the view that true parenting efforts can wait for the adolescence years. I am always amazed by the number of times I receive a call from a distraught parent seeking my counseling in dealing with their difficult teenager. When I inquire about what efforts they have made in the past to seek effective parenting guidance, they say that they never really thought about it since they did not encounter big problems with their child in the past. Although some great work is being done nowadays with adolescent therapy, the process required for meaningful change when a teenager is already in trouble is a difficult one that is often not successful. Once you reach the point where your teenager has an explosive temper, is belligerent, is depressed, has an eating disorder, is abusing drugs or has any combination of these problems, getting them back on track is very hard. I propose that if parents would be concerned with the parenting of their child from the beginning as much as they are concerned with the parenting of adolescents, the state of our ""teen problem"" would look very different. The efforts put into parenting your teen should start 15 years earlier, when your child is born. Knowledge about child development and consistently applying the right combination of parenting practices with your children from the get-go will make it much less likely that you will need the help of psychologists when they hit adolescence. Similar to the President's call for focusing on educating our children when they are young, parents should focus on parenting their children when they are young. The attitude of parents should not be, ""Just wait until your kids are teenagers""; rather it should be, ""Don't wait until your kids are teenagers; start raising your children now."""
2,TRAVEL,Not Cooking Off the Cuff: Top Vacation Tastes in London and Munich,"Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/not-cooking-off-the-cuff_us_5b9dd2e9e4b03a1dcc8d57d5,"We've been away (London and Munich) for thirteen days as I write this, so I'm going to list one standout taste from each.",2014-01-29,"Cod with lentils and salsa verde at Cafe Murano, London",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dd2e6240000510053bcde.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Jackie and I are away at the moment and are having a wonderful time. I'd thought I might cook with London friends last weekend and thus have a new dish to describe, but by the time we got to their house all the cooking had been done; all I can do is say thank you, Alfie, Angela, Neil and Salvatore (in alphabetical order), for such a delicious meal.As always, travel is inspiring in so many ways. We've seen paintings by new artists (new to us, that is), seen exciting operas and plays and, obviously, eaten food the memory of which will nudge my cooking in subtly new directions. We've been away (London and Munich) for thirteen days as I write this, so I'm going to list one standout taste from each.Day One (London): Cod with lentils and salsa verde at Café Murano. Not just perfect fish cookery, but eye-crossingly well balanced flavors: lots of aromas and just the right spark of acidity in the lentils, and likewise in the salsa verde. Brava, Sam Williams, the restaurant's head chef.Day Two: More fish. A compact and plump skate wing at Scott's. Nothing innovative here (it was garnished with the usual capers), but the fish itself, the neat preparation and the doneness were exemplary.Day Three: At Opera Tavern, a small but thick ibérico pork hamburger with a little foie gras mixed into the meat. A well thought-out dish, with garlicky mayo, two kinds of onion and hot pickled peppers on the side. Believe it or not, I have a little foie gras fat in the freezer, and next time we have a burger this is going into it, possibly melted into the bun.Day Four: Our Big Deal dinner at Hélène Darroze at The Connaught (which I've written about for Huffington Post Travel). The baba with Armagnac (see my travel post) was stunningly good.Day Five: Boned crisp breast of lamb at Hutong in The Shard, Europe's tallest building. They braise the lamb in spiced broth, bone it, chill it, fry it and cut it into little rectangles. I'll make a version of this at home and report on it within a few weeks.Day Six (in Munich): The mashed potatoes that came with my sausage platter at Spatenhaus an der Oper. Maybe talking about mashed potatoes sounds as if I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel, but no: these were topped with crisply fried onions. Again, nothing new, but they did it so perfectly that the dish was memorable.Day Seven: Kaiserschmarrn at Zum Franziskaner. A thick, eggy pancake, ripped into bite-sized shreds in the skillet and properly caramelized, with raisins and nuts. Eating it almost made us forget the Day-Four baba. Almost.Day Eight: A small thing, but one that's easy to duplicate. A soft pretzel (an excellent one), split horizontally and buttered: A Butterbrezel, which we had at the café in the Alte Pinakothek.Day Nine (back in London): A big ham hock raviolo with greens and chicken broth at Merchants Tavern. Its delicacy was a big, pleasant surprise: rather than that over-salted, somewhat desiccated pink stuffing you might imagine from the name, this was based on a smooth chicken mousse with just the right amount of cured pork. Typical of Neil Borthwick's cooking at this excellent restaurant.Day Ten: Haggis, mashed turnip (rutabaga) and mashed potatoes at the noisy but happy pub-restaurant The Ape & Bird. It was one day shy of Burns Night, so what else could we order? The grain in the haggis hadn't lost its chew, and the seasonings were lively and alluring. The texture of the turnips, too, was just chunky enough.Day Eleven: A southern Italian sort-of salami called ventricina del Vastese, tasted at an impressive ham and charcuterie (and cheese) supplier called simply The Ham & Cheese Company. It's made of big chunks of unusually lean pork and lots of fragrant chilies. Day Twelve was the night we had dinner at our friends' house. Hard to pick a highlight from so much good food, but the lamb shoulder simply roasted with vegetables was dreamy. Much of the credit goes to the cook(s), but a lot of it also goes to the butcher: The Butchery.Day Thirteen: Scrambled eggs with soft, not over-salted bottarga and grilled sourdough bread at Café Murano. Yes, we went twice, and if we were staying longer we might have made it three times. As it happens, I have some bottarga in the fridge at home, so this will probably be on the agenda once we're back in New York.And there are still two more days to go! I can't wait to see what's in store for us, especially at The Green Man and French Horn."
3,WELLNESS,What Oprah Winfrey Can Teach Us About Living Well,Lindsay Holmes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oprah-winfrey-living-well_us_5b9dd332e4b03a1dcc8d5fa8,"""I know for sure that appreciating whatever shows up for you in life changes your personal vibration,"" Oprah wrote in 2012",2014-01-29,"Oprah Winfrey smiles before being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in the East Room of the White House on Wednesday, Nov. 20, 2013 in Washington. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dd3322000004e00fe1c8f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In her lifetime, Oprah Winfrey has created a media empire and made a difference in the lives of others by joining us through our television screens. In 2013 she grabbed the No. 1 spot on Forbes' list of the most powerful celebrities, gave the commencement speech at Harvard and saw her network's ratings continue to climb. Whether it's interviewing notable figures or donating to the community, she has made a name for herself in more ways than one.But despite her celebrity, it turns out we can relate to -- and learn from -- the queen of TV in a lot of ways. Her wisdom and commitment to well-being is simple enough that we can all practice it in our everyday lives. In honor of her birthday, here are five things Oprah can teach us about living well.She makes meditation a priority.Oprah has been one of the most prominent public figures who has been vocal about the benefits of meditation. As a Transcendental Meditation practitioner, she makes it a point to sit in stillness for 20 minutes at least twice a day. In a 2012 blog she wrote for The Huffington Post, Oprah explained the reasoning behind why she engaged in the technique regularly -- and how it has contributed to her overall well-being:My life is better when I get still regularly. Call it meditation or call it quiet time -- doesn't matter. The benefits are the same. If you stay with the practice, it's like developing spiritual muscle. I promise you will become less stressed, more focused.She also credits the practice -- which has been proven to reduce stress, lower blood pressure and even makes positive changes to the brain -- to helping her create some of her best work. She offers meditation classes to her employees at Harpo Productions, Inc., which can help reduce burnout in the workplace.Despite numerous challenges, she cultivates resilience.Before creating the media empire she has today, Oprah experienced several large setbacks during her career. After working as a news anchor at a local Baltimore news station for nearly eight months, she was demoted from her position. But even after becoming a dominant daytime TV figure and building a net worth of $2.9 billion, she still had struggles to face. After launching the Oprah Winfrey Network in 2011, many wondered if it would last beyond a few years. Despite promising figures before the launch, viewership plummeted before she was able to turn the network around.In her 2013 commencement speech at Harvard University, Oprah addressed OWN's uncertain future, calling it the ""worst period in her professional life."" However, she told the graduates, she wasn't going to let that failure define her. ""I was stressed and I was frustrated, and quite frankly, I was embarrassed,"" she said. ""Then the words came to me, 'trouble don’t last always,' from an old hymn. This too shall pass. And I thought, I am going to turn this thing around and I will be better for it.""Cultivating resilience and overcoming challenges is crucial when it comes to living a happier, more joyful life. Studies have shown that by keeping a realistic, yet positive mindset, we can better physiological resilience and be more flexible to whatever may come our way. She's endlessly grateful.As an advocate for counting blessings, Oprah makes it a point to write down what she's grateful for each day by keeping a gratitude journal -- and she's happier for it. Studies have shown that expressing what you're thankful for -- even for the littlest things -- can lead to better health, a stronger connection to others and a greater sense of joy.""I know for sure that appreciating whatever shows up for you in life changes your personal vibration,"" Oprah wrote in 2012. ""You radiate and generate more goodness for yourself when you're aware of all you have and not focusing on your have-nots.""She embraces aging.Despite how most of us feel about growing older, research has shown that aging can have its benefits. A 2009 study found that as we age, the brain tends to focus on the positive, recalling happier memories more frequently than negative ones. ""If you're blessed enough to grow older, which is how I look at aging, there's so much wisdom to be gained from people who are celebrating the process with vibrancy and vigor and grace,"" Oprah said in 2011.Don Miguel Ruiz, author of The Four Agreements, told Oprah in a 2013 episode of ""Super Soul Sunday"" that our age isn't want matters -- it's how we react to it that defines our lives. ""Ninety-five percent of the beliefs we have stored in our minds are nothing but lies, and we suffer because we believe all these lies,"" he said. In a piece on her 60th birthday, Oprah detailed why it's important to accept aging, citing that embracing the inevitibilty will ultimately make you stronger. ""I'm turning 60, and I've earned the right to be just as I am. I'm more secure in being myself than I've ever been,"" she wrote. ""I approach this milestone ... with humility, supreme thanksgiving and joy.""Altruism is important to her.By now mostly everyone is familiar with Oprah's ""You get a car!"" giveaway on the Oprah Winfrey Show in 2004. But despite the Internet memes dedicated to making a joke of the moment, the event is just one of several examples of the media maven's altruism.Studies have shown that giving to others can reduce our stress, help us be happier at work and may even improve our longevity. Generosity, no matter if it's a small act like helping a friend or doing something bigger like volunteering in the community, contributes to better well-being overall."
