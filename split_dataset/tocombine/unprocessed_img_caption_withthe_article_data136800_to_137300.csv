Hanukkah and Thanksgiving are literally around the corner, with Christmas and the New Year following closely behind. The holidays are often a time of joy -- and a time of stress overload. The list I make of who needs a holiday card can start haunting me in November, and thinking about giving gifts creates both excitement and aggravation.Mobile technology and social media can up the ante on that aggravation. This past year, I have been paying more attention to the hold that digital devices have on us. During the holiday season, advertisements and reminders bombard us from every angle, cluttering up the Twitter feed and inbox. It's not surprising to find oneself obsessively scrolling through Instagram feeds and emails, or checking for last minute invites to parties or dinners. But before you short-circuit, think about this idea.As we approach the holidays, one thing we can do for ourselves and our families is plan to unplug. I confess the thought of this makes me nervous. What about my work, my patients, my friends? What if someone needs me? What if a task needs to get done? What if I miss an important email? This is exactly the reason to unplug for a bit. The holidays should be a time to mindfully experience family, friends and things we are thankful for. The best present you can give yourself and others is to stay present.For those (like me) who find the idea daunting, here are a few tips to get you through:1. Set a time to unplug. No one says it has to be for 24 hours, but a day is a great target (especially a holiday). Decide when this will start and take care of any urgent emails before. 2. Involve others -- recruit a sibling, spouse or friend. Being accountable to someone else beside yourself can increase success. Or take the challenge up a notch and experiment with the great family unplug. 3. Be mindful. This is an important one. Take time to notice what's going on around you as you are unplugged. Listen, look, experience. You'll be amazed at what you notice and what you were missing out on. That pie is a little bit sweeter, perhaps. Those holiday lights a little bit more colorful. Forgot how much you loved that holiday movie or that you love spending time with your cousins? This is a very inviting time of year. Really enjoy it.4. Be forgiving. If you find that you ""slip"" and pick up your phone or jump onto Facebook, be kind to yourself. Our social media habits are hard to break. Trust me -- I know. Also, unplugging is temporary and social media is constant. Try not to stress out about what you might be missing online. Your family and friends want to spend time with you now -- not relive it on your Facebook feed. Wishing you Happy Holidays now -- before I put the smartphone aside.Also on HuffPost:"

But even we can't get behind the latest portrait of the royal family, done by artist Thomas Kluge. The painting, currently on display at the Amalienborg Museum until March, is the product of four years of work, and it's described by the museum as ""a kind of magic realism."" But we're not sensing much realism at all. Not only are our favorite princesses, Princess Marie and Princess Mary, stuck in the back (not fair), but everyone looks a little... haunted. Creepy. And poor Prince Christian in the front, typically so cute and bubbly, reminds us of one of the twins from ""The Shining.""The kicker? Once the exhibit at the Amalienborg Museum is complete, this painting will hang in the royal family's home at Fredensborg Palace. Imagine waking up to that every day...The painting: Thomas Kluge, ""The Royal Family"" (Photo: Evan Frederiksen)The real thing:CORRECTION: This post previously referred to the royal family as Dutch, not Danish.Want more?

2,TRAVEL,How Does A Freaking Amtrak Train Get LOST In The Philly Suburbs?!?,Hunter Stuart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amtrak-lost-philadelphia-septa-new-york-fiasco_us_5b9dac2ee4b03a1dcc8b3914,An Amtrak train carrying 130 people got lost last week after it traveled too far backward while turning around and ended,2013-11-21,An Amtrak train heading to Union Station passes through the Canal Street Railroad Bridge,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dac2e1f00002c0021b56a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An Amtrak train carrying 130 people got lost last week after it traveled too far backward while turning around and ended up on local tracks in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Amtrak says the train, which was headed to New York from Philly, experienced a mechanical issue in the undercarriage of the front cab car, where the driver was. In an attempt to complete its trip, the train had to turn around so that the locomotive in the back could be at the front, Amtrak spokesman Craig Schulz told The Huffington Post Wednesday over the phone. ""They have to make a K turn and run with the locomotive in front,"" Shulz said. ""It's a rare move they'd never executed in that spot before."" While reversing, the train accidentally went too far down the wrong track, Shulz said. It ended up on local tracks of SEPTA, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, where Amtrak trains do not run. SEPTA shut down power to the track when it noticed the foreign train, SEPTA spokesperson Jerri Williams told HuffPost Wednesday. ""That will slow the train down,"" Williams said. The lumbering Amtrak eventually reached the Bala Cynwyd, Pa., SEPTA station. It came to a stop and received directions to come back to Philadelphia, where passengers were put on a separate train to New York. The incident happened mid-day on Thursday of last week. As a precaution, the train's engineer and its crew were taken out of service, given tests for drugs and alcohol and additional training before being allowed to return to work this week. The drug and alcohol tests came back clean, Shulz said. Shulz assured us that no one on the train was ever in ever danger. ""The infrastructure worked,"" he said. Luckily there were no SEPTA trains on that track at that time, Williams said. ""It was the middle of the day, so there was only one train before the morning commuter trains and the evening commuter trains,"" she said. ""There was no chance of an incident."" "

Twitter went public on the NYSE opening at USD 26 per share, valuing the company's worth at an estimated USD 18 billion.

San Diego State University researchers found that posts on Twitter seemed to accurately predict flu outbreaks in different regions across the United States. Researchers examined tweets that originated within a 17-mile radius of 11 different cities between Aug. 31 and March 4, 2013, recording the usernames, locations, tweet information (whether it was a tweet or reweet) and any links used in the tweets. Over that time period, 161,821 tweets were recorded that contained the word ""flu,"" while 6,174 tweets contained the word ""influenza."" Then, the researchers compared the location data of those tweets to data on flu-like illness rates on city and county levels. Out of the 11 cities whose tweets were examined, there was a statistically significant correlation for nine of those cities between the number of posts on Twitter regarding flu or influenza, and actual rates of flu-like illness. Plus, Twitter seemed to be predictive for five of the cities; in San Diego, Denver, Seattle, Fort Worth and Jacksonville, Twitter posts seemed to show signs of flu-like illness outbreaks sooner than the data from the cities or counties. Back in 2011, researchers from Pennsylvania State University were able to use Twitter to track attitudes toward flu vaccination. That study involved examining 477,768 tweets that mentioned the flu shot that were gathered between August 2009 and January 2010, and then labeling those tweets as either positive, neutral or irrelevant. Another study, published earlier this year in the Journal of Medical Research, suggested that using Twitter's GPS feature could also help locate disease outbreaks. "
