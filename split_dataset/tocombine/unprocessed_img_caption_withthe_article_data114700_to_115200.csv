Do you even remember that these ten years later?Billy Gilman: Yes...such a while ago, yet it seems literally like yesterday. I remember so much. Good and bad. Mostly great of course. Very lucky, I am, to have people respond to me and my voice that early on. Pretty bomb!! MR: You also sold over 10 million records worldwide before 16. How did the media attention and all that success affect you?BG: It really didn't affect me. Granted I have been very lucky but my parents were key. They couldn't care less if I'm their plumber or a 10 million selling singer. I'm still their son and they will kick my ass now as they did then. Haha. That's what most kids and young adults need. Parents that are just that. Parents!MR: You later made the decision to move back home with your family in Rhode Island and you've used your celebrity to help organizations like St. Jude's and the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Was this in some way getting back to your roots and grow intotoday's 26-year-old Billy Gilman.BG: Well, I make my time between Nashville and Rhode Island. Having traveled literally more than half my life I love RI and my family and friends. No one should give that up. The charity work was a no brainer for me. Seeing other young men and women and children battle every day hoping to live...how selfish could I be having done what I've done and not wanting to help in ANY way. It's bigger than all of us. Those kids and adults teach me more about life than I could ever learn elsewhere. MR: You recorded 2012's ""The Choice"" for yet another charity, Soles4Souls that included many artists. Can you first go into the story behind ""The Choice""?BG: So proud that this was accomplished! My co-writers Dan and Philip and myself were writing for this project and started on ""The Choice."" Knowing it didn't fit the run of the mill song we instantly knew it was an anthem. Why not an anthem for the greater good? We found a great charity in town--Nashville--called Soles4Souls. I then realized there had never been a song like We Are The World in country music so my brain start spinning. I thought why not ask the people I'm closest to in my field of work and see if they would commit to singing a line for the charity single. I started with 4 people and ended up with 18! Never In my wildest imagination would I have thought they all would say yes. I went to Haiti to see firsthand what the charity does and what this single would provide to so many. It's been an awesome and fulfilling project. MR: That brings us to ""Say You Will."" What's the story behind this recording, when is the new album coming, and can you go into any behind the scenes stories about it?BG: ""Say You Will"" is very special to me. It's the very first single I have co-written. It's like a baby lol. It was born during the time of ""The Choice."" Started with a chorus and it evolved into one of the best songs my voice has been able to perform. I love the treatment of it...letting the voice and words be the front running theme. Not an over produced pop/country song. MR: Billy, what advice do you have for new artists?BG: My number one advice would be, know who you are as an artist before anything else. Know your craft better than anyone. Listen to your gut no matter how many times other people question your gut.Be truthful whether it be personally or lyrically. And always make your fans #1MR: How do you picture your future, creatively and personally?BG: I really hope this brand new path--where it's basically me getting back into the ropes--is where I'll be for a while. Creating the best songs I can for my fans and getting out there to the public in any form. If you love what you do, truly love it, you will stop at nothing to achieve any form of success. That separates the men from the boys. Passion. BEN JAIMEN'S ""SATELLITES""According to Ben Jaimen...""I started working on 'Satellites' a few months before meeting with my producer. It has a great riff and when I played the song for him, we decided that it should be the single because it's so catchy and the hook really grabs you. It's a song people have on when they are having a good time, weather in a stadium concert or a party, or just hanging out with friends. It's about people being together. It's about people loving each other. I wanted to capture the excitement you get when you hear something you love, the feeling that makes you want to jump 'to the moon' because you are so excited.""I have been creating music my whole life and began songwriting when I was 14. I think this EP, Through the Universe, is the best representation of my work, and it's the perfect time to have others involved in my work. It's about teamwork, and I want them to be a part of the team...""http://new.benjaimen.com/A Conversation with Ernest RanglinMike Ragogna: Ernest, how do you feel about your creative body of work these days?Ernest Ranglin: I feel fine. And good! When you have been doing it as long as I have and still get to keep doing it, I feel like a lucky man. I love what I am doing. I still compose and write and I am always trying to find that sound...whatever it is that I am hearing at the moment. I am still learning.MR: You recently released the album Bless Up. How did it come together?ER: I a did a festival in California in 2011 and connected with some musicians out there that and I had met a nice gentleman named Tony Mindel and we seem to have some common ideas at that particular moment. The band had a nice connection and we did a quick little recording (album name Avila) in just a few days in lovely studio in northern California. I brought in a new composition and we reworked a couple of my older ones and each of the musicians added a tune and I think had had something pretty special. I really enjoyed the sound. We all stayed in touch and Tony and I connected again a year later in New York. I mentioned I had a stack of new compositions and Tony was excited to make another album. This time around we'd had more than a couple days in the studio to record what is now Bless Up. Needless to say I am very pleased with the results and this is a good feeling. The musicians have very international world flavor and style. Inx Herman is from Johannesburg and Yossi Fine is a very talented Bass player /producer from Israel, and keyboardist Jonathan Korty a great musician from the San Francisco Bay Area. This band and I have a special musical understanding. I hope people will agree when they hear these songs. MR: Any particular songs that you're most fond of having played, created or recorded for Bless Up?ER: That is difficult to say. I consider all of these songs good friends--this is a bit of humor as one of the tracks is titled ""Good Friends."" But really I like them all and think we have a pretty good variety on the recording. I think the compositions encompass many different styles--ska, reggae, jazz, world music--we put in some interesting elements and instrumentation on this album such as like harmonium and the melodica. These songs have flavors from many different eras of my career. So in that way, I like that we have so many sounds that will take the listener to many different places. MR: How do you approach your music now compared to when you first started?ER: Well I am always trying to be stay true to myself as a musician and a person. I never want to write for anyone but I also want people to feel good and enjoy what we are playing. I feel I have a certain style that is accessible to the listener but I try to keep it original and have some interesting things as far as melody, rhythm or tempo in each composition as well as well. I have many different influences of course--Charlie Christian, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker the great John Coltrane. But I work very hard to maintain a unique sound. I am self-taught, and always learning. I read a lot of music books when I was younger and the music that I grew up certainly influenced me but I have always tried to play my way. I try to portray what is necessary for the music. I try to play whatever suits the moment, as much as that is possible.MR: What have been your observations about music over the years? For instance, genre changes, new artists, technology?ER: Well music is always growing and changing and reinventing itself so I try to remain neutral in regards about judging new artists and technology. I am sure they were thinking my music was pretty different at some point when we were playing the ska rhythm and reggae for the first time. Everyone is a new artist at the beginning of their career and there are always new talents coming along. As far as technology, again the technology is just a tool and it always depends on how you use the tool. It always comes down to the music and if technology can help all the better, but for my style it usually comes out early in the process so hopefully we don't need much of anything else to make it sound the way we want it.When When I was just starting in studios we used very rudimentary 2-track recording. Vocalists shared mics. One mic for drums etc... But we got a lot of real sounds in those studios. There is always room for new things and developments in technology. That is just the way things go, but it still comes down to the essential musical elements and what people feel. It is always about feeling the music for me.MR: What are some of your favorite recordings that you've ever recorded? Do you continue to play them live?ER: That is a tough one as well. Again, I like so many of them it is hard to pick favorites. Of course, Below the Bassline is something I have always been proud of. I still do many of those compositions live so of course that one has a special place in my heart. Modern Answers to Old Problems and In Search of the Lost Riddim... They all came from a desire to explore new and different styles and I was lucky to be able to collaborate with great musicians. I try to play the style and sound that suits the moment. And there have been a lot of moments indeed. I am blessed to have the opportunity to travel the world and create music that comes form my heart and soul. MR: Does playing live still have that excitement to you like from when you first started out?ER: Oh yes, definitely. I still enjoy performing very much. Of course, as I grow older I play a little less but there is nothing like performing one's own music to people who truly appreciate it. I still enjoy traveling and seeing new and different places and visiting some of my favorite cities. MR: What do you make of the respect and reverence people have toward you and your music?ER: Well I am deeply appreciative and humbled by all the nice people out there who seem to appreciate what I am doing. I have always tried to create something of substance that is accessible and pleasing to the ears. I am very grateful that I have been able to create something that is enjoyable and don't plan on absconding anytime soon! I just want the good vibes to keep following me. MR: What advice do you have for new artists?ER: One, look for a good teacher. I know I wish I had one. 2--Always remain true to your own heart and vision and try not to be like anyone else. Of course, you can always have your influences but chart your own course and stay true to yourself! MR: Beyond promoting the album, do you have any plans or projects in the near future?ER: I am always interested in new ideas in music and learning about different musical cultures. Specifically, I am interested in music from India and Southeast Asia and, of course, Africa. Perhaps combining many different sounds from all over the world and infusing this into a one conceptual project...who knows. I think this new record represents what I am doing now but I am not planning on stopping. I hope the music will continue for a good long time.I also plan to write a book one day. I'd like to get down all the great stories from over the years on paper. That's part of my plan.A Conversation with Mary SarahMike Ragogna: Mary Sarah, your debut album Bridges on Cleopatra Records approaches country classics with their original hit artist singing with you. Where did the idea for an album like this come from?Mary Sarah: When I finished touring with Kidz Bop, I returned to Texas to find that the only place I could sing often was the local and regional opry's around Houston. I fell in love with traditional country music and fans were asking for a cd every time I played an Opry. So we originally set out to do an EP of the songs I sang quite often in the opry's but when we turned our attention towards Nashville I had people encourage me to think a little bit bigger. I was introduced to Kent Wells--Dolly's producer and band leader--who in turn introduced me to Dolly Parton. Truly, we started with a small idea that turned in to this finished project which is why I say it was ""miracle after miracle"".MR: Did you ever expect this level of country icons to appear on the album?MS: I don't think I ever ""expected"" anyone to agree to sing with an unknown, unsigned artist but I am so grateful that they did. I just kept going in to the studio and showing them what I could do vocally and then we would wait to see if they agreed. It was artist by artist and song by song. MR: What do some of these songs and artists mean to you, and do you have any specific songs on Bridges that you have specific memories or stories attached to?MS: I have stories with each one and this will always be one of the best things that I have ever done...I know that I will have stories to tell my grandchildren about these amazing Legends. ""Where The Boys Are"" seems out of place but this is a song I sang very early on in the Opry's and the iPhone video of it with the Oak Ridge Boys helped to give me credibility when asking some of the Legends if they would consider singing with me. It opened doors and I love to sing it. MR: You're an 18-year-old who, through this album, is creating a ""bridge"" to older generations and some beloved songs. Do you feel the weight of pulling off a project like this just right? Are you aware you might be presenting material like this for the first time to your peers and are you anxious to see their reaction?MS: I am excited because I told so many of my friends what I was doing on the weekends when I was in high school and they didn't have the faintest idea why I would choose this over a party. My parents have taught me to respect those that have gone before me and I hope to not only introduce my generation to these songs but to set an example that you can never go wrong honoring those that have made a way for you to follow your dreams. MR: What made you choose a country music path?MS: Losing yourself in the story. I love getting lost in a song and what it can do to your soul. MR: Are there other songs that you might have recorded but didn't have the time or room on the album for?MS: I really can't say that there is because I believe that the Legends that stepped up and said they would do this deserve all the recognition. There are no empty hopes or any regrets...I love it just the way it is.MR: What's your favorite track and why? Were you surprised by the approach taken by any of the guest artist performances?MS: I can not name one because I love them all. I was very shocked and surprised by Dolly. She said she loved the trax and wanted to dance around my vocals. I was in shock but I was not going to tell Dolly what to do. The outcome is an amazing version of ""Jolene"" and I am so happy because it does not sound like any other recorded version of ""Jolene.""MR: What advice do you have for new artists?MS: Take constructive criticism, don't let anyone tell you what your dream is and surround yourself with good people who make you a better person. Don't chase after fame because it is fleeting. MR: How do you picture Mary Sarah five years from now? What do you hope will happen for you MS: I hope to be touring and sharing great music with people around the world. I have been blessed enough to start with the Legends and I hope to be a Legend one day that can do what these Legends have done for me.A Conversation with Gangstagrass' RenchMike Ragogna: Rench, your first album was the big, happy Lightening On The Strings, Thunder On The Mic, then came the undeniable Rappalachia. Since then, you've been nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Original Main Theme Music. So what is all this Broken Hearts And Stolen Money stuff?Rench: All three albums draw heavily on the common ground Hip-Hop and Bluegrass have in subject matter--outlaw life, heartache, and being a badass. The latest album just turned out to have lots of songs with robberies, so I figured lets shout that out front in the album title. Maybe because robbing banks is how we financed the last few tours.MR: ""Long Hard Times To Come"" was your breakthrough, but It looks like another Gangstagrass song, ""Give It Up,"" is up at bat. Will this bring on even more heartache and thievery? R: Actually we have a newer track out now, ""All For One"" and we just released a video for it that is really starting to pick up steam. This track stands out as one of the rare happy and positive tracks. We show how Gangstagrass can be a symbol for how America could still come together and party. People think we are so divided that there is no common ground, but we are here to prove them wrong. It may be presumptuous to make ourselves the symbol of how America can be united, but if there is anything that stands for how we can bridge the gap between us, it's a rapper and a banjo player getting down together. So we have declared that this video is good for America.MR: Okay, perhaps you're Justified to do such things, but before we go any further, can you go into what gave you the idea to combine two traditionally contrasting genres? What are Gangstagrass' humble roots?R: My dad is from the panhandle of Oklahoma, so I grew up with honky-tonk music at home. And when I was in grade school, hip-hop blew up and my friends and I went crazy over it. I always liked things that pushed boundaries and experimented, and because of my honky-tonk roots, when I started producing hip-hop I always had an urge to put something twangy over the beat. I had to just go for it, bring my two main influences into one project.MR: Has Brooklyn caught on to Gangstagrass and as we speak mimicking what you're doing for fame and fortune?R: As far as I know, we are the only ones doing high quality bluegrass hip-hop. I would welcome anyone to join in and make it a movement, and we do have a great fanbase in Brooklyn, which is the perfect place for this--lots of great Bluegrass pickers and sick emcees. Who knows, maybe out there in a basement somewhere right now there is a jam going on to get the next great bluegrass-hip-hop band started. But for now we stand alone.MR: What and who were your early musical and personal influences and do you feel you've honored them with your creative adventures or have you shamed them to tears or both? Don't leave out anything about your RUN-DMC breakdancing.R: Yeah, in third grade, it was all about breakdancing for me - every recess we would throw down our cardboard to do our backspins to the Beat Street soundtrack. I had a casette tape I dubbed off of a friend with Run-DMC ""Raising Hell"" on one side and Beasty Boys ""License To Ill"" on the other, and I wore that tape out. But when I got home it was Willie Nelson and George Jones on the stereo. There was also Gram Parsons, which I learned more about later, and he was a definite inspiration in terms of crossing genres in a way that was ahead of his time, bringing psychedelic rock and country music together before people were ready for that. I think if he were around today he would probably be incorporating hip-hop into his sound.MR: Have you been slapped or approached with any other form of aggression by Bluegrass purists who feel you've made a mockery of their art form?R: For the most party the response from Bluegrass fans has been overwhelmingly positive. We just got back from a really successful appearance at the Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival, which was an amazing thing to be accepted into. But there is that fun little slice of purists for whom what we are doing is a crime against nature. They are certainly entertaining. Especially the claim we hear now and then that hip-hop is too violent. Apparently they aren't away of the incredibly violent tradition of ""murder ballads"" that are part of bluegrass history. One day on tour I put a version of ""knoxville girl"" on in the van and the rappers jaws dropped.MR: Where do you see this Gangstagrass-y stuff heading?R: We will definitely be seeing world domination sometime next week. I look forward to our own brand of sneakers, drinks, and cologne. We are currently working on flying sharks with laser eye beams. We will probably use those for transportation on tour next year. Right now the jetpacks keep falling off the sharks. But expect to see an expansion - there will be more Gangstagrass, a solo Rench release and some other secret side projects to be revealed in 2015.MR: What's your advice for new artists?R: Just do what you love and share it with the world and believe in yourself, and brush your teeth and don't do drugs.MR: Would you take your own advice?R: Absolutely not."

2,ENTERTAINMENT,Please Stop Asking Pedro Pascal If You Could Squeeze His Head,Maureen Ryan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pedro-pascal-game-of-thrones_n_5619749.html,,2014-07-25,"SAN DIEGO, CA - JULY 24: Actor Pedro Pascal attends day 1 of the WIRED Cafe @ Comic Con at Omni Hotel on July 24, 2014 in San Diego, California. (Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for WIRED)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60bdffd1240000b11e095adf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pedro Pascal isn't that different from most ""Game of Thrones"" viewers -- he wishes his character, the charismatic Oberyn Martell, was still on the HBO show. Pascal was at San Diego Comic-Con on Thursday, July 24, to launch a new ""Game of Thrones"" beer from Brewery Ommegang. After a packed audience watched Pascal tap the first keg of the amber-brown Valar Morghulis beer, the actor talked to HuffPost TV about missing his ""Game of Thrones"" role, and dealing with people who want to squeeze his head. HuffPost TV: How many of the people who walk up to you and want to say hello also want to squeeze your head? Pedro Pascal: Like, they want to puncture my eyeballs? A lot of them. I would say more than half of the people who want to get a picture. I always feel a little guilty when I say, ""How about I just smile?"" Because I don't want to have to re-create the moment over and over again. Yeah, that's a little troubling. You don't want to have to go to that place again and again. Yeah, I don't want to have to re-live the trauma. Would you rather still be on ""Game of Thrones,"" or would you rather have the impact that you had, as the character and the way he left? I think that ultimately, selfishly, I would want to still be on ""Game of Thrones,"" only because they are the greatest people I've ever worked with. Ninety percent of the work is taken care of by the writing -- more than that. Ninety-nine percent is taken care of by writing that is that good, and that's not something that I'm used to. On top of that, it's the best crew, the best design team and the greatest cast I've ever worked with. I had such a good time, and I've never been so challenged. Even if my part would shrink to a fraction of what it was, to get to be there and be around everybody and hang out, it's probably what I would opt for. I think I'm just going to guilt [executive producers] David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss]. I'm just going to describe my depression to the point that they're like, ""All right! Ellaria is going to have a dream!"" [laughs] Is it your favorite role? It's the best role I've ever played on screen, without question. You said it was challenging -- what was the biggest challenge of playing Oberyn Martell? I would say that the character had a confidence that was really important to portray. Any human being would have trouble feeling that level of confidence -- a dangerous sort of confidence, you know? He sort of owns his overconfidence -- with major consequences, as you could see. And then physically, it was a very challenging role. Also, I was very aware of the series, as millions are. I was a big fan of the show, and it was the first time I was ever asked to be part of something I was so hyperaware of as an audience member. So there was a lot to battle internally there. But David and Dan made it so easy. Even though you were aware of the show, were you prepared for the fandom and events like this and how the fans have been to you? I think the best thing to do is to play stupid. [laughs] It's all so exciting and you always want to be careful with your expectations and whether they're negative or positive. So I just sort of played dumb and had a job to do, which was so easy to do -- they loved the character so much, and that was on my side from the beginning. The writers and the directors, they loved on the character so hard. So there was that easy focus, and then it was not up to me in terms of how it would be received. "
3,WORLDPOST,Three Reasons We Need a Parliamentary Election in Ukraine,"Olga Bielkova, ContributorMember of the Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine)",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ukraine-election_b_5619935.html,"The sitting Parliament, where at least half of the delegates can be qualified as unprincipled populists at best and outright criminals at worst, is incapable of acting on behalf of the people and it must be dissolved.",2014-07-25,"Relatives and children of Ukrainian servicemen taking part in operations against pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine hold a banner reading ' I want to see the sons of officials together with my son!' during a demonstration demanding the rotation of servicemen on July 2, 2014 in front of the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev. Ukrainian troops backed by tanks and fighter-bombers pressed on Wednesday with a renewed offensive against pro-Kremlin insurgents that has drawn Russian ire but also vital US support. AFP PHOTO/ SERGEI SUPINSKY (Photo credit should read SERGEI SUPINSKY/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13b0e240000350076e3cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"First. It reflects the desires of our citizens. There is no inherent value in any mechanism of authority, unless there is popular support for it. About 70 percent of Ukrainians are in favor of early parliamentary elections, and it must be scheduled this fall. If for no other reason, we -- Ukrainian politicians -- have to do this to deliver on the promises of Euromaidan revolution. Second. The sitting Parliament hardly represents the overwhelming sentiment among Ukrainians, who want peace, prosperity, better governances, and stronger institutions on a journey towards closer integration with the European Union. Instead, we find terrorist apologists among the Members of Parliament (MPs). There are many claims of direct links between some MPs and the atrocities committed by the Yanukovych regime, some in Parliament advocate on behalf of the aggressor who has annexed our land and is fueling conflict in Eastern Ukraine. Those allegations will have to be duly investigated and criminal activity prosecuted under the law. It is unsurprising, that some are clinging to their parliamentary immunity and opposing the new poll. Third. Ukraine's future hinges on our ability to implement reforms. Uniting the country, clamping down on corruption, and creating conditions for economic development should be a guiding principle informing Parliament's legislative agenda. Difference of opinions as to how we can best achieve our vision is most welcomed, but some in the Parliament today do not share the vision for new Ukraine. They are keen on preserving the status quo, focused on advancing their personal interest at the expense of the people, and sabotage reforms as a matter of political strategy. The momentum for change is felt across the country, civil society is mobilized, and various consultative groups are formed to look for innovative solution, evaluate policies, and propose reforms. But then, the best of the initiatives never get implemented. The sitting Parliament, where at least half of the delegates can be qualified as unprincipled populists at best and outright criminals at worst, is incapable of acting on behalf of the people and it must be dissolved. MPs like Mr Kilinkarov, who is allegedly storing ammunition and weapons for pro-Russian terrorists in his own house, are a disgrace. Our legislative body needs to rid itself from those who have lost the trust of the people. Benchmarking against the new EU states, which have succeeded in their transitions and have attained high standards of living, it must be noted that they did not waste any time in the early years in vain disputes. The key to their success was a unity of purpose not just among the People, but also among their representatives. The right conditions were created when the ""old guard"" was thrown out in the Parliamentary elections. Two times Ukraine had almost grasped a chance for a real transformation, in 1991 when the Soviet Union fell and again in 2005 after the Orange Revolution, but we failed to ""reset"" our legislative body, and the results are palpably apparent. So today we are launching a constitutional mechanism that will give the president an opportunity to dissolve the Parliament and call for early elections. If we are to change anything, we must begin with ourselves."

It will eventually use 90 percent less water than a conventional building, recycling its water via a version of a system deployed on the International Space Station. And all of this technology is housed in a striking LEED Platinum–certified structure that maximizes airflow and sunlight to such an extent that for 325 days out of the year, no artificial lighting is necessary. Credit: Cesar Rubio/Courtesy William McDonough + PartnersSo what's it like to work in a ""space station on earth""? What would it take for every place of work to be a Sustainability Base? I checked in with two innovators who were (and are, since the Base is an ever-evolving endeavor) driving forces for the project: Steve Zornetzer, Associate Director of the Ames Research Center, and Alastair Reilly, a director at the architecture firm that designed the Base, William McDonough and Partners. Jennifer Grayson: The Sustainability Base opened just over two years ago along with some extraordinary expectations. How is it going so far?Steve Zornetzer: From an energy efficiency point of view, the building is performing very close to what we expected. We're still tweaking it, but the bottom line is that we're producing more than twice the energy the building consumes each year. JG: I'd say that's a lot. Where does the excess go?SZ: That extra energy, which amounts to about 1,400 megawatt-hours per year, is put back into our Ames grid and used by other buildings on our campus. [Note: For a nifty comparison, that's the equivalent of the total wind power capacity of Romania.] Alastair Reilly: Even before plugging in all of the technology, the building's design -- the thin plates, tall ceiling heights, maximized daylight and open floor plan -- put us at an energy reduction in the 50 to 60 percent range compared to a conventional building. It's also in a special location with a great climate. You can [minimize energy] by opening your windows.JG: Sounds like a great place to work.SZ: The occupants of the building love the light; they love the fresh air. They love that the building is quiet, too. It doesn't have any noise associated with heating or air conditioning or any of the things that most traditional buildings do. JG: The California climate is really great. The record drought, however, is not. How are you minimizing water consumption? SZ: We're using a version of a brand-new NASA technology that's currently being used on the International Space Station to support water recycling for six astronauts. Our original goal was to use 90 percent less potable water than a conventional building and we're at about 70 percent at this point. I'm confident we'll get there. JG: I read the astronauts up there are drinking water made from recycled urine. Is that what you're doing here? SZ: The system has the capability of doing that but we've chosen not to use it for blackwater recycling at this point. JG: I know some public toilet-to-tap programs have had a tough time with their constituents getting over the ick factor. AR: The major setback on the recycling of blackwater beyond the added cost has been local codes. The California health department monitors blackwater reuse and it can still be an onerous process to navigate. SZ: We're taking all the graywater that the occupants generate from sinks and kitchenettes and showers -- what normally would have gone down the sewer and into the storm drains -- and we capture it and clean it up. It's actually at a potable drinking standard, but we're putting it back for urinal and toilet flushing so we're not wasting potable water for that purpose. JG: What other NASA technologies are being tested at the base? SZ: The other main NASA technology is what I call the intelligent adaptive control system. When it's completed, it will control all the building's primary systems -- the heating and cooling, the opening and closing of windows, artificial lighting in different zones of the building ... It will learn from its own experience and adjust its own software accordingly so that over time, it will optimize its own energy performance.AR: This isn't just a smart building; it becomes almost a genius building.JG: Sounds very HAL 9000-esque. But in a good way. How much more energy will the system save?SZ: We're at about one-and-a-half watts per square foot using the current technology. By some back-of-the-envelope calculations, I think we can tweak it by maybe another 30 percent if we can fully optimize things. JG: That's impressive, considering how plugged in the NASA engineers working there must be. I imagine a lot of screens and laptops.SZ: Through the cloud we're able to record and manage the electrical use of all of the equipment [employees] are using in their work spaces. It was actually surprising to us how much energy a screen saver uses.JG: Really? Turning my screen saver off now...SZ: Employees can also tap into their own energy consumption [via an energy monitoring dashboard] and get a historical picture of how their own energy consumption changes over time. AR: It's what we refer to as almost the Prius effect. You've got this real-time user interface where you can let off the foot pedal or do different things to game the system and get that efficiency. JG: I was just going to say: That sounds like my Prius dashboard. SZ: It's biofeedback. We have a Prius also, and my driving behavior has changed dramatically. Our employees are taking what they're learning about energy efficiency in a building like this and changing their behavior at home. JG: Could you imagine if every government building could produce twice the energy it consumes? I read that the federal government alone controls some 10,000 buildings. SZ: Right now the government is strapped for cash. Funding is an issue. But I think mindsets are changing as people begin to realize that climate change is real. My vision is: Could you just imagine if every new building built on earth could produce more energy than it consumes? How that would change the paradigm, what that would mean for society and our planet?Got a great idea for my next Innovation Earth column?

5,RELIGION,U.S. Monks Turn To Centuries-Old Tradition To Supplement Health Care Costs,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trappist-monks-massachusetts_n_5617877.html,,2014-07-24,"In this Thursday, Jan. 9, 2014 photo Father William, a Belgium trained brewer of Trappist beer checks the live yeast count in a recent batch of Spencer Trappist Ale at the Spencer Brewery in Spencer, Mass. The monks at St. Josephâs Abbey have been raising money for more than 60 years by selling jams, jellies and liturgical clothing but now they have a new source of revenue, the brewing of Spencer Trappist Ale. (AP Photo/Stephan Savoia)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ec713c000018010daf2b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - Tucked off a two-lane highway in a hilly, wooded section of central Massachusetts, a group of Roman Catholic monks has embraced a centuries-old tradition they hope can sustain their aging members in a world of rapidly rising health costs.The 60 monks of St. Joseph's Abbey still rise at 3 a.m. for prayers and pass most of their days in silence. But when it is time for work, a handful head down to the monastery's new brewery, the first outside Europe to produce certified Trappist Ale.The venture has proven to be less labor-intensive than the monks' other businesses, making religious vestments and fruit preserves. More importantly, they believe it can generate enough money to sustain a community of men with an average age of 70 who now spend about a third of their budget on health care.""We're trying to reinvent our economy,"" said Father Isaac Keeley on a recent tour of the abbey's low-slung stone buildings and starkly modern 30,000-square-foot brewery, nestled in a wooded property some 60 miles (97 km) west of Boston.Work has always been a part of life for Trappists, a monastic order tracing its roots to 17th Century France, with monasteries around Europe and North America selling products ranging from coffins to cheese. The goal of these businesses is to bring in enough cash to sustain a community of men who pass most of their lives in seclusion.The Spencer monks debated the move into beer making for more than a decade, as more of their members aged and moved into the monastery's 12-room infirmary, which is usually full.""The health costs are huge,"" said Father Dominic Whedbee, the abbey's 65-year-old prior, the group's second-ranking member. ""Our infirmary is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That way we can take care of all our men for the rest of their lives, which is our commitment.""AGING CLERGY A CHALLENGESupporting an aging clergy is a challenge faced across the Catholic church in the United States. While monasteries and similar religious orders operate outside the structure of local parishes and dioceses, many of which have paid heavy costs to settle claims of sexual abuse by priests, their members are also aging.The Retirement Fund for the Religious, a Catholic group that acts as a last-gasp source of funding for retired monks, nuns and other members of religious orders, currently supports 34,243 religious people over the age of 70. It forecast that by 2023, there would be four times as many retired members of such orders as those who are still working.The fund it operates is forecast to run dry by 2026, from $8.64 billion in 2010, according to a 2012 study done for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops by human resources consultancy Mercer Management.The problem is more acute among Catholic clergy than Protestants in part because Catholic clergy tend to serve for longer periods and do not marry, which means they do not have spouses who can help support them, said Cynthia Woolever, a sociologist who focuses on religion and publishes a newsletter on the Presbyterian church.""They stay in the priesthood. It is a vow for life, whereas Protestants have a higher dropout rate,"" Woolever said. ""Once you are a priest there really is a commitment on the part of the Catholic church that you are going to be supported and cared for life.""TECHNOLOGICAL FIXWhen the monks decided to begin producing beer, they toured a number of European abbeys, including Notre-Dame de Scourmount, which produces Chimay beer, a dark, high-alcohol brew popular with Trappist ale aficionados in the United States.The monks from St. Joseph's found themselves more impressed by the lighter, less-potent beers that European monks produced for their own consumption. They call their Spencer Trappist Ale a ""refectory ale"" that pairs well with the simple food of their mostly vegetarian diet.After touring breweries packed into centuries-old monastery buildings, they also decided to build a modern, highly automated brewery that requires less manual labor from the abbey's aging monks, the oldest of whom is 99.The brewery initially aims to produce 124,000 gallons (469,391 liters) of beer in its first year and top out at 310,000 gallons (1.2 million liters) in about five years. Sales to distributors in Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode Island have so far passed expectations, leaving the monks on track to meet their goal of being able to support the monastery and its charities on the brewery's earnings within a decade, said Keeley.The growth potential has won over many of the monks who at first resisted the idea of brewing, he added.""Monks don't really like change,"" Keeley said. ""But when we started to run out of options for a revenue source, we started listening."""

At a women's college, you won't be told you can't do something, simply because you're female nor will you be told what to think (but you will be exposed to all kinds of stimulating thoughts and ideas). In addition, colleges for women are affordable and provide a quality education. More and more college-bound high school girls are deciding to attend a women's college. See for yourself by reading my first Huffington Post blog post, Why I Chose a Women's College.To learn more about women's college read my other Huffington Post blog posts or visit my blog: Advantages of a Women's College.

North Carolina Congresswoman Renee Ellmers, who is running against Clay Aiken this November, urged the Republican Party, especially men in the party, to bring policy discussion ""down to a woman's level.""""Men do tend to talk about things on a much higher level,"" Ellmers said. ""Many of my male colleagues, when they go to the House floor, you know, they've got some pie chart or graph behind them and they're talking about trillions of dollars and, you know, how the debt is awful and, you know... We need our male colleagues to understand that if you can bring it down to a woman's level and what everything that she is balancing in her life -- that's the way to go.""Clearly, Ellmers hasn't been paying attention to the negative reactions other politicians have incurred when they trivialized rape and reinforced gender stereotypes? Is she so naïve to believe that just because she was talking at a Republican gathering the Internet wouldn't let the world in on her statements? Doesn't she know there are women astronauts now and cabinet members, that women run Fortune 500 companies, that, in fact, women are presidents in a number of countries... maybe our own before too long. Not that we don't have a long way to go before full equality.Sure women and men are different. Recent brain science is showing just how different. Women tend to have more emotional, psychological and fluid intelligence, pay attention to details more, are more willing to ask for feedback, to hold authority in a more collaborative, less top-down manner, to go to the doctor when their health seems challenged... which may be one reason we live longer than men -- a kind of intelligence the world really needs, in fact. It's not that women are better than men, it's just that we're not having to constantly prove our masculinity. What bothers me is that Ellmers equates gender difference with inferiority -- men speak on a ""higher"" level and women can only understand on a ""lower"" level. Feels like she's trying to prove her masculinity.Now to Todd Akin. Sure, Ellmer's comments have sparked some controversy, but definitely not as much as if a man were to make the same comment. But are we supposed to give Ellmers a pass just because she's a woman? As my friend Gloria Steinem wisely put it, ""If Clay Aiken said women can't read pie charts, it might lose him the election. It should lose it for Renee Ellmers, too.""Where does that leave Clay Aiken? Todd Akin showed that out of touch politicians are vulnerable. It's déjà vu with Ellmers. Clay Aiken should take note."

This headline number makes things look worse than they really are. To a large extent, it reflects something that has already happened, namely the large negative US growth rate in the first quarter. But it is not all due to that. It also reflects a number of small downward revisions, both in advanced and in emerging economies.The overall story remains largely the same as before:Advanced economies are still confronted with high levels of public and private debt, which act as brakes on the recovery. These brakes are coming off, but at different rates across countries.Emerging markets are slowing down from pre-crisis growth rates. They have to address some of their underlying structural problems, and take on structural reforms. At the same time, they have to deal with the implications of monetary policy normalization in the US.Let me take you on the usual tour of the world.Advanced economiesThe United States First quarter growth in the US, as currently reported (I would not be surprised if the numbers were revised), was far worse than anybody had anticipated. In retrospect, it seems to be largely due to one-off factors, ranging from an inventory correction to unusually bad weather. Looking forward, US growth for the rest of the year is still forecast to be 3.25 percent and 3 percent in 2015.The main policy issue, at this juncture, is the appropriate speed of monetary policy normalization. Given the unusual behavior of labor participation, and uncertainty about the equilibrium rate of unemployment, assessing the amount of slack in the US is difficult. The current plans, namely the end of tapering later this year and increases in the policy rate from the middle of next year, are appropriate. But the timing of the increase in the policy rate may have to be adjusted, as a function of developments on the inflation and unemployment fronts.A recent report by the BIS has drawn attention to the potential for excessive risk taking in financial markets coming from an extended period of low rates. We agree that, in some financial markets, valuations appear perhaps optimistic. But, overall, we do not see a systemic threat to financial stability, mainly because of lower leverage in both banks and, to the extent we can measure it, in non banks as well. Were the risks to increase however, macro prudential tools should be the right first line of defense. Getting ready to use them should be a policy priority.The Euro area The recovery in the Euro area remains weak, and inflation remains too low. Our forecasts for the Euro area remain roughly unchanged, 1.1 percent for 2014, and 1.5 percent for 2015. These numbers hide, however, differences across countries. In the core, we have revised our forecasts up for Germany, and down for France. In the periphery, we have revised our forecasts up for Spain, down for Italy.To strengthen the recovery, the Euro area clearly still needs strong action on both the demand and the supply side:In most Euro countries, unemployment rates far exceed their equilibrium value, and Euro wide inflation is too low. Thus, demand side policies are still of the essence. As fiscal space is tight, monetary policy must continue to support activity. The recent measures taken by the ECB are welcome. It is too early to assess their effects, and if inflation continued to remain stubbornly low, more measures should be considered.Monetary policy cannot do the job alone however. The asset quality review currently under way in European banks is critical to reestablishing confidence in banks, and improving intermediation. And looking beyond the demand constraints, structural measures must be taken to increase very low potential growth rates. These measures differ across countries, ranging from reforms to re-enfranchise the unemployed youth, to measures that increase competition in non-tradable sectors, to infrastructure spending.Japan We have revised upwards our forecasts for Japan, to 1.6 percent in 2014. This reflects the effects of Abenomics, and stronger domestic demand, including investment. The fundamental challenge of Japan remains, how to decrease public debt and increase growth both in the short and the long run. Our forecast for 2015 gives a glimpse of the difficulty. Growth is forecast to be only 1.1 percent, reflecting in part the adverse effects on demand of the planned increase in consumption taxes later in the year.Emerging market and developing economiesWe forecast growth in emerging market and developing economies to run at 4.6 percent for 2014 (a revision down of 0.2 percent), and 5.2 percent for 2015 (a revision down of 0.1).Our largest downward revision, relative to our WEO April forecast, is for Russia, where we have revised growth for 2014 from 1.3 percent to 0.2 percent, and for 2015 from 2.3 percent to 1 percent. This reflects mainly a deterioration of business confidence, which has been aggravated by geopolitical tensions. The result has led to large capital outflows, and a near freeze in investment decisions.Housing investment has slowed down in China, and we expect this slowdown to continue. The government has counteracted this through a series of targeted stimulus measures directed at priority areas such as railway investment and social housing. Recent months have also seen higher credit flows and increasing infrastructure spending, as well as improving exports. Thus our forecast for this year is broadly unchanged at around 7½ percent growth. The main challenge for China remains however to achieve a more balanced growth, with less investment and more consumption.Looking forward, emerging and developing economies face two challenges.The first is to implement reforms to rebalance their economies and strengthen their growth. Some of these countries, Mexico notably, but others as well, are indeed embarking on ambitious reforms, which should help lift investment and growth.The second is to adapt to a changing world environment. This change has already started. The recovery in advanced economies implies increased demand for their exports. The normalization of monetary policy in the United States, however, implies that some of the capital flows that went to emerging markets in search of higher returns will eventually return home. This in turn implies tighter financial conditions and a tougher financial environment. Foreign investors are less forgiving, macroeconomic weaknesses are more costly. And financial bumps, such as those we saw in May 2013, may well happen again.In short, the recovery continues.

But the show’s cast reportedly foresaw this fate in the weeks leading up to their final show, according to star, Saul Williams. “We've known what was going on all along. Every day at rehearsal, Kenny Leon was saying, ‘Let's be very clear with the fact that this play is probably going to be hated coming out the gates,’"" Williams admitted during an interview with Rolling Stone. “We see how full or empty the house is every night. Twenty-six thousand people have seen the play and, of those people, we've had fucking standing ovations every night and tremendous support from the people that have seen it. But the producer, Eric Gold, said to me, ‘We expect that the first two months are going to be really difficult.’""Earlier this month the New York Times reported the production grossed $144,773 during the week of July 6, playing to just 16 percent of The Palace Theatre’s maximum capacity. Williams added that negative reviews ultimately impacted the show from reaching its full potential. “One of our producers came in really angry because he had spoken to one of the TKTS people [who man Broadway ticket-selling booths] — not saying she was a producer — and asked them, ‘What about Holler? Should I see that?’ And the response of the person who is supposed to guide tourists to plays was like, ‘It's a bit of a downer. It's not necessarily as fun as’ whatever other play they mentioned,” he explained. “Then she approached another one and that person was like, ‘Oh, it got really bad reviews.’ We started a street team at the last minute to counter those TKTS people who are really supposed to be promoting everything on Broadway. I also cannot go without saying that there was something deeply embedded in a lot of the reviews that went deeper than just a dislike of the play.”   Read more of Saul Williams’ Rolling Stone interview here.

The United States and Europe strengthened sanctions on Moscow over Ukraine yesterday, with President Barack Obama taking his first direct swipes in the finance, military and energy sectors of the Russian economy. Putin warned the biting sanctions will boomerang and hit back at US national interests, will inflicting 'very serious damage' on an already tattered US-Russia relationship.

It's an unusual ask in a trade deal, since countries typically demand restrictions on foreign imports in trade talks, while requesting special treatment of their own exports.The U.S. government banned crude oil exports in 1975. The U.S. Department of Energy currently has the power to reject applications for natural gas exports to countries that do not have a free trade agreement with the U.S.Given the sheer size of the EU economy -- roughly equivalent to that of the United States -- the proposal would dramatically increase the demand for American oil drilling and natural gas hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.Burning natural gas is less environmentally destructive than oil or coal, but not nearly as beneficial as clean energy alternatives. The energy required to ship natural gas abroad would offset much of its environmental benefit. Extracting the gas with fracking may destroy local ecosystems and pollute drinking water.On Thursday, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace, Oxfam America and other groups cried foul over any trade pact that would expand such activities. ""We call on the United States to oppose the inclusion of a specific chapter dedicated to energy or any provisions in the TTIP that could lead to automatic approval of export licenses for crude oil and natural gas,"" the letter reads.Trade deals frequently have more to do with foreign policy concerns than economic or environmental considerations. Recent tension with Russia over Ukraine, in particular, has highlighted the EU's dependency on Russian natural gas. Loosening U.S. exports of natural gas to the EU would increase American leverage in diplomatic negotiations involving Russia. Environmentalists note that there are many ways to accomplish this goal that would not be lousy for climate change, a pressing global crisis that both EU and Obama administration officials have pledged to combat.Read the full letter here."

The UN Human Rights Council on Wednesday launched a probe into the Gaza offensive, backing calls by the Palestinians to hold Israel to account despite fierce opposition from the Jewish state. The decision came after a marathon seven-hour emergency session of the top UN human rights body, where the Israelis and the Palestinians traded accusations over war crimes.

""We are continuing to work on it, but it is not set at this point.""Israel's security cabinet released no decision after meeting late into the night on a proposed humanitarian truce under which fighting would cease immediately but negotiations for terms for an extended deal would begin only in several days' time.Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal, speaking in Qatar, said his fighters had made gains against Israel and expressed support for a humanitarian truce, but only if Israel eased restrictions on Gaza's 1.8 million Palestinians.""Let's agree first on the demands and on implementing them and then we can agree on the zero hour for a ceasefire ... We will not accept any proposal that does not lift the blockade ... We do not desire war and we do not want it to continue but we will not be broken by it,"" Meshaal said on Wednesday.Israel has signaled it prefers to press on with its ground troops offensive to find and destroy Hamas's rocket stores and wipe out a vast network of tunnels Israel sees as having been built for the purpose of infiltrating its territory. U.S. FLIGHT BANBut Israel is also under growing pressure to curtail the fighting, especially with American aviation authorities having banned U.S. flights to Tel Aviv for the past two days, spooked by rocket salvoes out of the Gaza Strip.On Tuesday the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration took the rare step of banning flights to Tel Aviv, and renewed the order on Wednesday.Many other foreign carriers, on heightened alert after a Malaysian airliner was shot down over a combat zone in Ukraine last week, followed suit. Israeli carriers continued to operate.Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri praised the flight bans as a ""great victory"" for the Islamist group.Israel also came under criticism from the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, who said there was ""a strong possibility"" Israel was committing war crimes in Gaza, where 703 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in the fighting.Pillay also condemned indiscriminate Islamist rocket fire out of Gaza, and the United Nations Human Rights Council said it would launch an international inquiry into alleged violations.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted furiously.""The decision today by the HRC is a travesty,"" he said in a statement. ""The HRC should be launching an investigation into Hamas's decision to turn hospitals into military command centers, use schools as weapons depots and place missile batteries next to playgrounds, private homes and mosques."" ROCKETS IN SCHOOLSThe U.N. secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, lashed out at militants in Gaza, by expressing ""outrage and regret"" at rockets found inside a U.N. school for refugees, for the second time during the current conflict.Storing the rockets in the schools ""turned schools into potentially military targets, endangering the lives of innocent children,"" U.N. employees and the tens of thousands of Palestinians seeking shelter at Gaza schools from the fighting, Ban said. He urged an investigation.Kerry returned to Egypt late on Wednesday after meeting in Jerusalem and the West Bank with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Ban and a grim-faced Netanyahu.""We have certainly made some steps forward. There is still work to be done,"" said Kerry, on one of his most intensive regional visits since Netanyahu called off U.S.-sponsored peace negotiations over Abbas's power-share deal with Hamas in April.Israel launched its offensive on July 8 to halt rocket salvoes by Hamas and its allies, which have struggled under an Israeli-Egyptian economic blockade on Gaza and were angered by a crackdown on their supporters in the occupied West Bank.After an aerial and naval bombardment failed to quell the outgunned guerrillas, Israel poured ground forces into the Gaza Strip last Thursday to destroy Hamas's rocket stores and tunnels.""We are meeting resistance around the tunnels ... they are constantly trying to attack us around and in the tunnels. That is the trend,"" Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner said on Wednesday.Palestinian health officials said Israeli tank fire killed 16 people early on Thurday, including six members of the same family.Three Israeli soldiers were killed by explosive devices on Wednesday, lifting the army death toll to 32. Three civilians have also been killed in rocket attacks out of Gaza, including a Thai laborer hit on Wednesday.The military says one of its soldiers is also missing and believes he might be dead. Hamas says it has captured him, but has not released a picture of him in their hands.Rocket fire at Israel slowed slightly on Wednesday when 98 rockets were fired, 70 of them striking Israeli territory and 25 intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system. Through much of the fighting more than 110 rockets had been fired daily at Israel.Israel said it detained 150 Palestinians in Gaza for questioning about involvement with militants, and that it targeted more than 100 rocket launchers, tunnels and military compounds across Gaza on Wednesday.Gaza has been rocked by regular bouts of violence since Israel unilaterally pulled out of the territory in 2005.Hamas, which rejects Israel's right to exist, balked at Egypt's truce proposal last week and said its conditions had to be met in full before any end to the conflict.These demands include the release of hundreds of Hamas supporters arrested since last month in the West Bank and an end to the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza, which has stymied the economy and made it near impossible for anyone to travel abroad.The war is exacting a heavy toll on impoverished Gaza. Palestinian officials say at least 475 houses have been totally destroyed by Israeli fire and 2,644 partially damaged. Some 46 schools, 56 mosques and seven hospitals have also suffered varying degrees of destruction.
