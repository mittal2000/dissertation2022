""It's original. Fuck it.""She also (fleetingly) mentioned that she is working a new show.

1,HEALTHY LIVING,6 DIY Stress Hacks Using What's in Your Closet,"Kristen Lee , ContributorBehavioral Science Therapist and Professor, Recovering Perfect...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/6-diy-stress-hacks-using-whats-in-your-closet_b_7525764.html,"When we keep stress in the closet, we aren't doing ourselves any favors. Instead, bring these everyday items out of storage and put them to good use to minimize the negative impacts of stress.",2015-06-06,2015-06-06-1433605429-5371326-StressHacksSneakers.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-06-1433605429-5371326-StressHacksSneakers-thumb.jpg,"When we keep stress in the closet, it doesn't do us much good.Instead, use what's in there to bring about better mental clarity and health. These DIY stress hacks are simple, proven means to bring about some well-deserved recalibration. Try them out to see what brings maximum impact to your stress bottom line.1. Towel as a yoga mat. Grab your favorite towel and get your Zen on. Research is increasingly demonstrating the positive effects of yoga on our brains and bodies. Try out some of these popular poses for 20 minutes and notice the relief.  2. Questionable fashion choices as comic relief. Yes, even fashionistas and hipsters have temporary lapses in judgment. Dig out the old duds, have a hearty laugh and be reminded not to take yourself too seriously, and that we're always capable of progressing.3. Sunday Best as a confidence booster. Sometimes slumps can erode our esteem and motivation to care about appearance. In a study examining the impact of our clothing choices, Psychology researcher Karen Pine found that wardrobe choices are tied to our emotional states. My Aunt Cecilia used to say it like this: ""put your earrings on everyday!"" Apparently, what we wear can lead to higher confidence and improved moods.4. Ditch the E-screens for sunscreen. Work will always be there. Grab your backpack, stuff it with Scooby snacks and sunscreen, and hit the trails. When we breathe fresh air, move vigorously, and enjoy nature, we escape from the daily grind and feel less stressed. The phone and computer screens will still be there when you get back.5. Epsom salt as an invigorating escape. Draw up a hot bath and douse it with Epsom salt, which contains magnesium, and has been dubbed by Dr. Mark Hyman as the ""relaxation mineral"". Lock the door, turn up the tunes and breathe deeply.6. Sneakers as sneakers. Okay, there's nothing complicated here. Put them on, lace them out, and get moving. Try to clock in close to 10,000 steps daily. As they say, running is cheaper than therapy. And walking is a surefire way to keep a smile on your face and facilitate improved mood, memory and focus. When we keep stress in the closet, we aren't doing ourselves any favors. Instead, bring these everyday items out of storage and put them to good use to minimize the negative impacts of stress. Coping with life's demands doesn't have to be as complicated as we sometimes make it. In fact, often is the case that small revisions make a big difference in our health and well-being."

Marshall. It was a commencement address at Harvard University. It set in motion a masterful plan to rebuild Europe from the ashes of World War II.   The Marshall Plan, as it was soon known, was grounded in the idea that humanitarianism is the road to peace. For as Marshall said in his June 5 speech, ""Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos.""It is this Spirit of the Marshall Plan that should be well remembered by our leaders, for it can guide us through the stormy waters of today's international affairs. The Marshall Plan won the peace after the most devastating war in history.   Europe after World War II was living in desperate conditions. Cities and towns had been destroyed by the fighting. There were food shortages. Help from America had prevented hundreds of millions from starvation in 1946. But more danger was to follow.   Even after Marshall's speech, conditions in Europe went downhill in the summer of 1947. A major drought took place. Before the Marshall Plan aid could be enacted by Congress in 1948 there had to be emergency food aid for areas in need. The interim aid program, signed in 1947, did just that for Austria, Italy and France.The American public also had its own little Marshall Plans in action during the fall of 1947. First was the Friendship Train that went across America picking up canned good donations to be shipped to Europe.   There was also the famous CARE packages which Americans bought many thousands of to feed the hungry overseas. In fact, at Thanksgiving and Christmas of 1947 Americans took in a ""silent guest"" at their holiday meals which led to a donation to buy CARE packages.   The end result was European children being fed meals at school and getting a chance at a future. Schools, businesses, factories and farms were rebuilt throughout Europe from this outpouring of aid which culminated in the Marshall Plan. There is a historical photo showing bombed out houses in the Netherlands. There is also a photo of the same row of houses after Marshall Plan aid. They are all rebuilt and a child is riding a bike down that same street. That sums up the Marshall Plan in its rebuilding of communities and whole nations after World War II.  Marshall, the former Army Chief, knew full well the effects of war. He knew that humanitarian aid was necessary to build peace, establish freedom and prevent future wars. The recovery of Europe was essential during the Cold War to prevent Communism from taking over more nations.   Today, we also need to summon the Spirit of the Marshall Plan as we face huge international challenges. There are more people displaced by conflict and disasters today than any period since World War II.   In Iraq and Syria the terrorist group ISIS has taken over cities and towns. There are millions of Iraqi and Syrian civilians displaced and living in hunger and poverty. We need to help them and build a peace in these countries.   South Sudan and Yemen are two other countries lying on the brink of famine from conflict. We can't ignore the cries for help coming from the civilians of these nations. They are the ones that can move their nations toward peace, but not if they are starving to death. The United States Food for Peace program, if Congress gives it enough support, can play a major role in helping support the innocent war victims abroad.   So as we head into the unknown of the future, let's reflect on a great achievement of the past. We have seen desperate times before and overcome them. The Marshall Plan is one of our great stories of peacemaking in action and one we will be wise to remember today."

The Eastern Star's top-deck cabins with smashed blue roofs jutted out of gray water Friday after Chinese disaster teams righted the capsized river cruiser to ease the search for people still missing. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14f0a240000330024fdde.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"JIANLI, China -- As the Eastern Star cruise ship was fighting to stay upright in the midst of a storm on the Yangtze River, Xia Sougui was trying to crack open a locked door for an elderly woman in the nearest town. A locksmith by trade, 38-year-old Xia (pronounced ""shyah"") had driven through knee-high water to get to the partially flooded house.“It all came down so hard in one hour's time,” Xia said of the storm that night. “It was like water being dumped from buckets.”The next morning, Xia woke up to the news that the cruise ship carrying 456 people, many of them retirees, had capsized just miles away. Since that morning, Xia and hundreds of local Jianli residents have volunteered their homes, cars and kitchens to help rescue teams and distraught families that are pouring into the county. Taxi drivers and car owners have tied yellow ribbons to the side-view mirrors of their vehicles, marking them as ""compassion cars"" that give free rides to rescue teams, families and journalists.On Thursday and Friday, those cars could be seen all over town. According to a government spokesperson, 200 taxis and 1,500 private cars were taking part in the effort as of Thursday. A local TV station was giving away the ribbons, and a radio station dedicated itself to broadcasting the contact information of local residents who were offering up meals and their spare rooms to help.“To me, compassion isn’t about how much money or resources you can put out there,” Xia told The WorldPost. “You do what you can. If you have this much, then you give this much.” Xia worked for eight years on boats hauling coal and corn before he learned the locksmith trade. As soon as he heard the news of the accident, he called up an uncle with a motorboat. Rescue crews were taking a while to reach the remote city, and Xia wanted to help. Unfortunately, the boat was being repaired in a nearby city.Instead, Xia outfitted his car with the yellow ribbons and a sticker offering free rides. Friday morning, he gave a ride to an older woman whose family was on the boat. Other drivers said they have transported soldiers, police officers and journalists.Wang Xiang, a taxi driver who has volunteered his vehicle, said he heard Tuesday night that busses were dropping off families at the nearest highway exit. In response, so many volunteer drivers rushed to the scene that when Wang got there, all the families had been taken care of.“I think we’ve had the best response of anywhere in China,” Wang said. “We’re all one family. Who doesn’t have parents? Who doesn’t have kids? When something like this happens we want to put out a hand to help.”In recent years, China has experienced something of a ""bad Samaritan"" crisis. Stories and viral videos have emerged showing pedestrians ignoring people bleeding on the street. In the most infamous incident, 18 pedestrians averted their eyes and walked around a 2-year-old girl who had been run over by a car. A closed-circuit video of the incident became one of the most-watched videos of the year, sharpening the national crisis of conscience.The grassroots efforts in Jianli have also compared well with mounting tensions over the official response to the accident. Families in several cities have grown angry over the lack of information or access to the crash site. On Wednesday night, a group of families forced their way through a police cordon to get to the site, and on Friday a distressed family member burst into a closed press conference to demand a central government probe into the incident. As of Friday, just 14 of the 456 people on the boat had been rescued, and 103 people were confirmed dead. Authorities began lifting the boat on Thursday night in an attempt to speed up the recovery of bodies.For a place like Jianli, the sudden influx of national and international media attention is a highly unusual phenomenon. This ""small"" county located in central China is home to 1.5 million people. Without tourist attractions, major manufacturing or even a train station, the county's economy rests largely on corn, farming and fishing. Per capita GDP is around $2,000.“We’re just a small town,” Xia said. “When this accident happened, you could say that the whole world suddenly knows this place. I feel that the people here, the people from all different walks of life, are really caring.”More from The WorldPost on the Eastern Star tragedy:"

Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet is more like a river. It disturbs and shatters, splashing to disrupt tranquility. Its dancers run and leap; they dislike stagnancy. People rarely talk about lakes. Rivers, on the other hand, benefit from a sex appeal that's the stuff of ballads. This is no coincidence. At BAM's Howard Gilman Opera House, Cedar Lake makes waves with its farewell season this week. The dancers move with reckless abandon -- rushing, flowing, daring. As they share the stage for a final time, it's heartbreaking to accept that a troupe with such chemistry, vivacity, flavor, and joy is saying goodbye to its home and to one another.

Ushers directed traffic until everyone found their seats as the clock struck seven-thirty-five. For a moment, there was complete serenity; then, a burst of energy. Navarra Novy-Williams exploded into view, swaying with panache to French music that better suited a runway than BAM. The room went cold, even frigid. Nobody knew what to make of the action until Ebony Williams came onto the scene and all was right, and genius, and unparalleled in its novelty. The latter Williams is the dance community's Beyoncé. As her legs managed a 180-degree line in a side tilt, she proved her technical prowess, but it was her unhindered attitude that made her especially unforgettable.

Siegal's vision coupled with his diverse cast embodied the 21st century with its technological obsession and fast-paced lifestyle. Dancers moved with synchronized intensity, mimicking the plugged-in robots we've become. Matthew Rich lip-synced like a rock star, crashing to the floor over and over like a track on repeat.

Ten Duets: Ida Saki, Jon Bond Photo Credit: Sharen BradfordFinally, Johan Inger's whimsical Rain Dogs made its NYC debut. A man crawled with a tape player, slurring through the lyrics of ""We Are the Champions."" A dog stood center stage, burning. Women switched clothing and gendered mannerisms with men, and Vânia Doutel Vaz claimed that the piano had been drinking. Ida Saki sat prone, waiting for her partner's approach. Muscles flexed along the floor, setting libidos ablaze. Inger's universe was enchanting, intoxicating. Desirable. The show no doubt merited a standing ovation, and it got one. But Cedar Lake itself deserves some applause, too. Rarely can dance become more than movement, a stirring feeling in your gut. There are barriers. There's an invisible screen. There are steps leading to the stage, and an orchestra pit, and balconies, and it's all very grandiose and isolating and placid. Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet is more about making noise by tearing down the fourth wall. Its roar will be missed."

Calm looms over a clear surface without tides. No matter if the wind shouts or murmurs, the water barely stirs. It's settled, unperturbed. It craves nothing but silence. Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet is more like a river. It disturbs and shatters, splashing to disrupt tranquility. Its dancers run and leap; they dislike stagnancy. People rarely talk about lakes. Rivers, on the other hand, benefit from a sex appeal that's the stuff of ballads. This is no coincidence. At BAM's Howard Gilman Opera House, Cedar Lake makes waves with its farewell season this week. The dancers move with reckless abandon -- rushing, flowing, daring. As they share the stage for a final time, it's heartbreaking to accept that a troupe with such chemistry, vivacity, flavor, and joy is saying goodbye to its home and to one another.  My Generation: Ebony Williams Photo Credit: Juliet CervantesWednesday evening's bill opened with a premiere by Bessie winner Richard Siegal, but the performance began at the opera house door, where patrons swarmed like schools of fish lost in a stormy brook. Ushers directed traffic until everyone found their seats as the clock struck seven-thirty-five. For a moment, there was complete serenity; then, a burst of energy. Navarra Novy-Williams exploded into view, swaying with panache to French music that better suited a runway than BAM. The room went cold, even frigid. Nobody knew what to make of the action until Ebony Williams came onto the scene and all was right, and genius, and unparalleled in its novelty. The latter Williams is the dance community's Beyoncé. As her legs managed a 180-degree line in a side tilt, she proved her technical prowess, but it was her unhindered attitude that made her especially unforgettable. Sassy, fresh, fierce -- she could be the poster child for je ne sais quoi.  My Generation: Matthew Rich Photo Credit: Juliet CervantesThe rest of Siegal's piece, My Generation, was like a Monster high that you never want to end. Siegal's vision coupled with his diverse cast embodied the 21st century with its technological obsession and fast-paced lifestyle. Dancers moved with synchronized intensity, mimicking the plugged-in robots we've become. Matthew Rich lip-synced like a rock star, crashing to the floor over and over like a track on repeat. The millennials were in the spotlight, their carpe diem mentality on display. The culmination? Chaotic, blinding bliss. Next was Ten Duets on a Theme of Rescue, Crystal Pite's work from 2008. Lights glimmered like at a stadium, when you're alone and pretend that all the world's watching. Cliff Martinez's score haunted bodies that intermingled in the dusk, falling, chasing, barely arriving. Lifting. Heaving. Sacrificing. You felt that if you joined them in their intimate space, you would somehow reach enlightenment, and that enlightenment would look something like love.

9,IMPACT,Harm Reduction Meets Healthcare Reform Where It's At In the Empire State,"Robert Cordero, ContributorPresident and Chief Program Officer, BOOM!Health",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harm-reduction-meets-healthcare-reform-where-_b_7516750.html,"In 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, we knew that new opportunities were emerging for drug users who were disconnected from the traditional healthcare system.",2015-06-05,"People abusing drugs, with African american man and caucasian guy sharing the same syringe to inject heroin",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1db02240000510096e677.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, we knew that new opportunities were emerging for drug users who were disconnected from the traditional healthcare system. Long-ignored and marginalized by a fragmented ""sick care"" system that has historically profited from their episodic, crisis-oriented care, our participants are finally starting to get the attention of reformers. The thousands of people we serve at BOOM!Health's Harm Reduction Center in the South Bronx are very much the high-risk, high healthcare need Medicaid beneficiaries whose care is the focus of Medicaid Redesign initiatives nationwide. They have significant socioeconomic disadvantages, multiple chronic health conditions, and a history of high-cost care. We've been doing patient-centered care for decades; a phrase now on the tip of everyone's tongue in the health care field. Harm reduction services, including syringe exchange programs and the array of services for injection drug users that have developed around syringe exchange, have a long history of addressing the health and basic needs of drug users by meeting them where they are at on the continuum of drug consumption.A new study from The New York Academy of Medicine, funded by the MAC AIDS Fund, ""The Integration of Harm Reduction and Healthcare Reform: Implications and Lessons for Healthcare Reform,"" highlights the opportunities and challenges of harm reduction programs' interface with emerging healthcare reform initiatives, and solutions pioneered by harm reduction programs like BOOM!Health. The overarching theme that emerged from the study is the need for healthcare reform strategies to move beyond the clinical care needs of patients and directly address the social determinants of health like food/nutrition, housing, legal support, and employment assistance. By embracing and putting into practice holistic person-centered care, harm reduction providers have developed promising models with their healthcare provider partners to serve these patients. These models feature clinical care for physical and mental health that is coordinated and co-located with services that address basic needs such as food and housing; that offer counseling and advocacy in regard to health and healthcare and basic needs; and that provide access to safe injection equipment, harm reduction education, and drug treatment. For marginalized populations living in precarious circumstances, such services are essential to establishing the stability that allows them to take care of their health. Part of the comprehensive report is a case study of our co-located services at the Harm Reduction Center. Peter Schafer, Senior Policy Associate at the Academy and the lead author of the report told us ""BOOM!Health was identified as a creative, yet simple and exemplary model of the integration of clinical, mental health, and basic services such as meals, showers and social support for harm reduction program participants. In addition to offering syringe exchange, HIV and Hepatitis C testing, and care management, BOOM!Health also offers on-site primary healthcare, mental health services, suboxone treatment, and pharmacy services."" Through an on-site partnership with Evers Pharmacy, a federally qualified health center Brightpoint Health (formerly known as HELP/PSI), and nutrition services through The Momentum Project (along with a host of other informal partnerships), we are truly able to create that person-centered medical home that reformers seek.. But at BOOM!, we're not only able to meet the array of behavioral and physical healthcare needs of our participants, but to also recognize the humanity of our participants by offering them the kinds of things that we all want and need - social connection, a warm meal, convenience, and respect. This keeps our participants coming back, making medical compliance finally within reach. Prior to co-location, we were giving them needles but their toes were falling off from diabetes-related issues. We might have been dealing with their diabetes diagnosis, but we were unable to ensure any kind of coordination of care. The entire motivation to get co-located healthcare and pharmacy wrapped around all the basic needs came from this realization. The timing of this report from The New York Academy of Medicine is poignant. We have reached a rare moment in which unlikely players are beginning to move beyond stigma to accept common sense solutions when it comes to drug use. It's an unfortunate reality, but it often takes a crisis to get the mainstream to pay attention to harm reduction and the people we serve. Whether most recently in Indiana, following the state's largest HIV outbreak in history due to lack of a syringe exchange infrastructure, or here in New York last year when Republican state senators responded to rising heroin overdoses in their districts by championing a unanimously supported bill to expand access to the opioid overdose reversal drug Naloxone, harm reduction for people who use drugs tends to become politically palatable only when public health needs become urgent and widespread. Evidence-based harm reduction interventions like syringe exchanges and Naloxone tend to emerge when a crisis erupts. But it doesn't have to be this way. With healthcare reform, the financial incentives for health systems are moving from volume to value and outcomes, requiring them to engage hard to reach and stigmatized patients like active drug users. This is especially the case in New York, where the state health department has invested billions of dollars in health system restructuring, expanded care management programs through health homes, and offering new behavioral health home and community services through Health and Recovery Plans (HARPs). With these reforms, the system is beginning to recognize the need for tools like those in harm reduction that promote the triple aim by offering truly person-centered care that is coordinated, and prevent the need for costly and crisis-oriented use of health services. Long the unpopular kid on the block, it's time for community-based harm reduction services to shine by sharing lessons for high quality health care that improves the lives of drug users in New York and beyond."

12,BUSINESS,The Six Things the Most Productive People Do Every Day,"James Altucher, ContributorAuthor and Entrepreneur",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-six-things-the-most-p_b_7519802.html,I admit I stole this title. Part of being productive is to piggyback on the shoulders of greatness. So I decided to write down what six things I do every day that help me with productivity. They make work for you. Or not. They work for me although I always need to improve.,2015-06-05,2015-06-05-1433518125-8598669-mainqimg0b6e687fd4ead42452e449e9b22c74ae.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-05-1433518125-8598669-mainqimg0b6e687fd4ead42452e449e9b22c74ae-thumb.jpg,"I admit I stole this title. Part of being productive is to piggyback on the shoulders of greatness. So I decided to write down what six things I do every day that help me with productivity. They make work for you. Or not. They work for me although I always need to improve. About six years ago I would say I was 100% unproductive. Everything I did would cost me in either well-being or money.By ""well-being"" I mean, competence, good relationships, and freedom. So when I say ""cost me well-being"" I would do things to specifically hurt the above three. So what is ""productive""?Things that either increase my well-being: my feeling of growth or competence in a field I love (for instance, writing), my relationships with others, and my sense of freedom (which could (but not always) involve money).Using that filter you can easily decide what is productive and what is not. For instance, do you respond to that negative comment on the Internet? No. Never. That person is dealing with his issues. Maybe he or she needs help from people who love him. But you don't have to give that help. That would be unproductive. Freedom can also come from needing less, so then you need less money. As an extreme example, if I don't need to own my own private jet then that's $100,000,000 less I need to feel comfortable with what I have. Important to note that these three items of well-being are not goals.I will never be ""competent"". And my relationships are never finished. And freedom is about my choices right now, not my choices in the past or the future. A day is productive if I GROW in competence. If I grow in my relationships. If I grow in my feeling of ""choosing myself"" - my freedom to make my own decisions in life instead of catering to the decisions and tastes of others.My six things (please help me and add to my list):READINGReading is maybe the most productive thing you can ever do. Here's what happens: when you die at the age of 100: you've just lived one 100 year life.But when I read a book in a few days time, I just absorbed an entire life, curated, of someone I admire or respect.It's like every book I read is a mentor. How many mentors do I have? 1000s. SLEEPINGI used to admire people who say, ""I only need 3 hours of sleep a day"".Only later do I find out that most of these people are borderline mentally ill. Think about the people in your life who say they only need 3 hours of sleep. Be honest. Maybe they are a little..? (fill in the blank). Why is sleeping productive? There's brain science about rejuvenating neurons, etc. I read that somewhere.There's all sorts of studies that people who sleep more get sick less, have more willpower, are less at risk for cancer, etc.But there's something else. Dan Ariely, a guest on my podcast, says that the brain's peak performance happens 2-4 hours after you wake up. Meaning: if you wake up at 5am, then from 7am to 9am, your brain is 100 times as active as when it's tired late at night. So here's what I do. I wake up at 5. I'll read (or take a walk), until 7am, and then I'll start writing. Writing is the activity I love most. I'm a little kid again when I write. So I want my brain to be at it's peak. So from 7 - 9am I'll write.THEN, I do a trick. Many days (when I can) I'll take a 1-2 hour nap around 1 or 2 in the afternoon. Then I know that two hours later my brain AGAIN will be peaking. Maybe not as much as before. But enough. So I'll write again. This is why I do my Twitter Q&As at 3:30 (every Thursday). Because I know my brain is supercharged then.I know that if I do the activity I love most when my brain and body have the most energy then that will create the most value, create the most opportunities for me, improve my competence and improve my freedom (because of the opportunities generated).EAT AT HOMEI don't like to eat out. It takes so long. And then you have to wait for the bill. And I always feel bloated and I hate salads in restaurants.So Claudia and I make simple meals (Claudia has been super inspired by Rich Roll and his wife Julia Platt so lately all the things we eat come from their book Plantpower) and we are done in about 10 minutes, two meals a day.So I probably save an hour or two by not eating out or not eating junk that will bloat me and make me less productive.THROW STUFF OUTA few months ago, Claudia and I threw out almost everything we owned. What do we really need?I like reading on the kindle. How many sheets do we need? We never have guests. How many clothes do I need? I was storing clothes I hadn't worn in forever.Our house was totally empty. It was really nice. I felt like a breath of fresh air was going through my head.Einstein says (as an insult), ""if a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind, then what does an empty desk mean?"" I'm okay with that, Albert! I don't mind having an empty mind.It makes room for new things, new connections between my memories, new things for me to enjoy. Less things to obsess on.Cleaning the outside and cleaning the inside reduce stress. Every day I try to throw things out. It makes me feel good. It also make me feel like I need less. Throwing things out tells my brain, ""you don't need this anymore"" so my brain stops wanting things.NO NEWSSomeone asked me a few weeks ago to comment on ""the situation in Greece"". Is Greece still a country? I had to look it up. I guess they are going to default on their debt. So what? This gives TV people something to argue about. I'm happy for them.People are wired to notice lions much faster than they notice apple trees. That's why we are alive. Since there's no more lions chasing us down Main Street, the news tries to find other ways to trigger that fight or flight reflex.I don't need to fight or flight in order to improve competence, improve relationships with people, or improve my freedom.So no TV. No news. No web surfing. No books about current events. No talking to people about current events. No conferences about what's going on in the world. NO MEETINGSI never went to a meeting where someone gave me a check at the end. I've never traveled to a meeting where it resulted in me making money or being happier. Most meetings can be summarized in a two line email.I'll go to a meeting if it's with my friends. That's fun and improves my relationships. But I never go to any other meetings.What if you are an employee and you have to go to a meeting? Try to get out of it. Or go for part of it. Or insist you only go if there are no chairs at the meeting (meetings will be faster then). Or find a job where there's less meetings. Or show your boss there's evidence that company's with fewer meetings make more money.NO PHONEI talk on the phone maybe once every other day. Again, the two line email thing works in most cases.EMAILI like Neil Strauss's approach. He has one hour a day scheduled for emails. His wife has his password so he can't even log on to email before that hour.I don't email for an hour. My emails are mostly to readers with quick questions or to people I am inviting onto my podcast. I don't email anyone else.I DO use texts though. Because they are faster. And I can text answers to people's questions in my spare time while riding a cab or waiting for my kids or whatever. My phone number is 203-512-2161.Sometimes I answer questions via text and sometimes on my podcast, ""Ask Altucher"" and sometimes on my Twitter Q&A on Thursdays.Again, if you're an employee somewhere you might be in the habit of responding quickly to email from, say, a boss. But try to cut it down to end-of-day when your brain is moving a bit slower and you don't need it as much.ONLY do the thing you love most during your peak productive hours.Hmmm, I just realized I gave eight ways to increase productivity. Since I've broken the rules (nothing wrong with that) I'll add a ninth.EXPERIENCESWe're the sum of our experiences and not our material things. Experiences stay with us forever and build us into who we become. They add to our well-being. Material things get lost or thrown out or lose their usefulness.A good experience for me is: where I meet friends, where I learn something new, where I learn something new that can increase my freedom.When I do something I know will be unproductive my gut reaction is saying ""Ugh, I can't believe I have to..."".Here's my trick: if I always change ""I have to..."" to the words ""I get to.."" then I can usually turn the experience into something productive.Today I have to take my kids to dance recital rehearsals.But then I get to see them dance.- - -The author also wrote about how you can increase your productivity by 500%.

The Common Core standards ask for students to demonstrate analytical thinking, among other skills, and teachers have been developing curricula to foster those skills.To provide collaboration time, and to reap the benefits of a dedicated physical education program, the Hollister district spent more than $750,000 on salaries for physical education teachers and aides, as well as equipment. To do so, the district tapped into the additional state revenues it received under the new Local Control Funding Formula for students, often called high-needs students, who are English learners, low-income children and foster youth.The funding formula allows districts flexibility in spending, as long as they demonstrate that their high-needs students are benefiting from the additional spending in proportion to the increase. Because 70 percent of Hollister district students are high-needs, program improvements that benefit the majority of Hollister students meet the requirements.Through the back door of the Common Core, some districts that for decades have been unable to muster the will or the funds for elementary physical education specialists are finding a way to hire by tying physical education classes to teacher preparation time. The number of districts hiring appears to be small and the majority of California elementary schools continue to rely on classroom teachers to teach physical education.But the scattered hiring is a shift in a physical education landscape that is under scrutiny. Thirty-seven California school districts – which together educate more than 1 in 5 elementary students in the state –- agreed to a settlement in April in a lawsuit that alleged the districts failed to provide elementary students with the minimum number of physical education minutes required by the California Education Code.Some district administrators have said that elementary school teachers don’t have time to provide the required 200 minutes of physical education every 10 days because students need every minute of classroom instruction to prepare for standardized tests.But when physical education specialists are brought in to relieve elementary classroom teachers, the need to keep students in class every minute seems to disappear, noted Dianne Wilson-Graham, executive director of the California Physical Education-Health Project, a network of educators. “I’ve not heard that conversation happen,” she said.The combination of new funds and a new priority on teacher preparation appears to be accomplishing in a few districts what children’s health advocates have struggled to do –- put highly qualified physical education teachers in elementary schools to help children establish lifelong fitness habits.When the San Lorenzo Unified School District was looking for ways to provide elementary classroom teachers time for Common Core preparation, said Barbara DeBarger, director of elementary education for the district, “it was a natural 'Aha!' to say let’s make it physical education.”“We really felt like the kids weren’t getting the quality physical education that a specialist could provide,” DeBarger said. The district hired 10 physical education teachers for elementary schools at a cost of about $700,000, drawing on the additional state revenue it received for high-needs students in the district.She said the district is eager to see the results of students’ fitness, as measured in the annual 5th-grade state Fitnessgram, a series of push-ups, sit-ups, distance running and more.The Redondo Beach Unified School District had never had a credentialed physical education specialist in its elementary schools, said Annette Alpern, deputy superintendent. “Zero,” Alpern said. “This is not something that was recently cut due to funding. There’s no history.”This year, Redondo Beach Unified hired full- and part-time elementary physical education teachers equivalent to nearly four full-time positions, using money from a flexible state grant for Common Core teacher preparation. “We needed time for grade-level teacher teams to work together, and we decided we could get a double win on it by hiring credentialed teachers to teach physical education,” Alpern said.In the Fallbrook Union Elementary School District, Superintendent Candace Singh said that hiring elementary physical education specialists had long been on her mind as a way to encourage student health. The opportunity to hire arose during the creation of the district’s three-year planning document, known as the Local Control and Accountability Plan. Parent support for physical education teachers was strong, she said, while classroom teachers wanted more time to plan lessons aligned with Common Core standards.To achieve both goals, the district hired four elementary physical education teachers, as well as instructional aides, and bought new equipment at a total cost of about $375,000, Singh said. To foster grade-level teacher collaboration, some physical education classes are taught by grade level. That means 80 to 100 2nd-graders, for example, are in a P.E. class under the supervision of one physical education teacher and two instructional aides.Those class sizes concern Joanie Verderber, a past president of the California Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance, a Sacramento-based membership organization. “It then becomes not an environment for instruction, but more like a supervised recess,” she said.“I would hope there is an appreciation of what physical education is about,” Verderber said, “but the factor that has motivated the hiring is the need for more time for teachers to collaborate for the Common Core.”Mario DiLeva, executive director of the Torrance Teachers Association, said he shared some of those reservations. The Torrance Unified School District funded 6.4 elementary physical education teachers this year primarily as a benefit for classroom teachers, and secondarily for the value they bring, he said.And they are temporary hires, funded by a one-year state grant for Common Core teacher preparation. “This program is good,” DiLeva said. “Unfortunately, it’s only here as a delivery mechanism for professional development.”That grant ends June 30. But last week, the district said it plans to continue the temporary positions using the additional state funds it receives for serving high-needs students.DiLeva balked at what he called “a revolving door” of temporary elementary physical education teachers.“What I’d like to see is the district saying that the physical education curriculum is important, the minutes of instruction are mandated, so let’s develop a program,” he said."

However, it would be unthinkable to judge any trial as fair if the accused is not allowed a voice to defend themselves.",2015-06-05,"German Ambassador to the US, Peter Wittig (R) speaks alongside French Ambassador to the US, Gerard Araud about the Iranian nuclear negotiations at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, May 26, 2015. AFP PHOTO / SAUL LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14f0b2400006800382ccf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The P5 +1 (the U.S., France, Great Britain, China, Russia, and Germany) have reportedly reached an agreement on a ""snapback"" mechanism to re-impose sanctions if Iran is found in material breach of any final nuclear agreement. The French ambassador to the United States, Gerard Araud had hinted that such an agreement was in the works at a discussion hosted last week by the Atlantic Council. If reports are true, it would mean one of the major obstacles dividing the P5+1 in the negotiations has been resolved, removing one important barrier to a deal.While the reports on the agreement on the snapback mechanism have shed some light on the general outlines, it remains tentative because Iran has yet to agree to it. According to reports on the compromise between the six powers who make up the P5+1, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will monitor and report on Iran's nuclear activities on a regular basis to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). If a violation is reported, then it is referred to a dispute resolution panel that will most likely be made of the six world powers and Iran. The panel will then issue a non-binding opinion to the UNSC, and there the final determination to ""snapback"" the sanctions will be made. The details of this agreement have yet to be fully released, but this has not stopped critics such as Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post to prematurely lambaste it as yet another ""concession"" to Iran. It is quite curious that Rubin contends that this is a capitulation to Iranian demands given that it's an agreement negotiated internally by the P5+1 countries, not with Iran.According to a report by the Times of Israel, Russia has agreed to waive its veto power if the reinstatement of sanctions is put to a majority vote at the UNSC. In return, the U.S. has apparently agreed to not push for automaticity of snapbacks as long as the vote is held in a timely manner after the dispute resolution panel has issued its opinion. Ambassador Araud had alluded to this agreement at last week's Atlantic Council discussion. On Wednesday, Thomas Pickering, the former U.S. ambassador to the UN, indicated that the P5+1 has reached an agreement along these lines among themselves and that it is up to Iran to sign on to it. If these reports are accurate, not only do they refute Ms. Rubin's assertions, they also signal a major concession by the Russians (and presumably everyone else on the UNSC) to give up their veto power. This is a huge victory for the U.S. and its European partners who were worried that enforcement would be stonewalled at the Security Council.Rubin criticizes the not-yet-finalized agreement by questioning why Iran is allowed to participate in the dispute resolution panel at all. However, it would be unthinkable to judge any trial as fair if the accused is not allowed a voice to defend themselves. It is not unreasonable then to assume Iran would want to be able to make its case if there is a dispute as to its compliance with the terms of a final deal. The expectation that Iran will abrogate its sovereignty by allowing the P5+1 group -- or any combination thereof -- to determine whether it is living up to its obligations is not only unrealistic, it ignores the basic tenets of International Law.Another point of concern for the Iranians -- who are after all a party to these negotiations, not just subject to it -- is based on the threats made by the likes of Sen. Tom Cotton and the 46 other senators who signed his letter warning that the next administration would not be bound by the terms of the agreement. The Iranian negotiators likewise fear America's willingness to abide by the terms of an agreement over the long term, and it is only natural that they would take part in a process to judge adherence to the deal.Even if the dispute resolution panel issues its non-binding opinion in a way that is contrary to the evidence provided by the IAEA because of Iranian, Russian or Chinese maleficence, the UNSC will still make the final determination on the re-imposition of any sanctions. The details have not been revealed yet, but it is safe to assume that whatever the final snapback agreement looks like, it will not be the ""formula for paralysis"" Rubin suggests.Rubin seems to equate any concession -- a natural part of any negotiation -- as one too many. Her absolutist stance extends beyond snapback, as she recommends that the U.S. ""reimpose sanctions, begin to check its [Iran's] activities in the region, make the threat of force credible and then start negotiations from scratch."" For Rubin, and other critics like her, the only acceptable outcome is an Iran without a single centrifuge or an ounce of nuclear material. However, Iranian nuclear know-how and the thousands of additional centrifuges amassed over the past 11 years cannot be sanctioned or bombed away. Our closest European allies recognize this fact. ""The agreement is not perfect. It's a compromise,"" Amb. Araud stated in last week's discussion, adding that we have to accept Iran will have some limited enrichment capacity. However, it appears that for critics like Rubin any evidence of compromise -- whether with or without Iran at the table -- is just cause to shoot first and ask questions later."

Credits: ILO Photo - Pouteau / Crozet Our world is changing faster than ever and if you ask any teacher, they will tell you that one of the greatest challenges they face is to educate a generation of children today for a set of jobs that will arise tomorrow. Yes there will be some professions that stand the test of time -- although they too will undergo serious transformations as they adapt to modern challenges. There will be teachers, doctors, electricians, engineers, architects and historians -- to name a few occupations that seemingly persist through the ages. But there are so many jobs out there that we probably cannot even imagine today. 25 Years ago, we didn't have social media managers, big data architects, App developers, bloggers, video journalists, infographic- or 'user-experience' designers. All of these jobs have sprung up in recent years and the speed with which jobs require an unprecedented set of skills keeps growing. What will the job market look like in 2050? The future of work in the spotlight at the annual International Labour Conference (ILC) which takes place in Geneva this week. The ILC is honing in on mega trends and long-term drivers of how work is going to be pursued in the years to come. Will it be in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which already account for more than half of the job creation globally? Or will people be more and more self-employed? And what about the progressing automation? Experts from all over the world are searching for new policies, innovative solutions and practical responses that promote honest and productive work. This event convenes over 5.000 delegates from the ILO's tri-partite constituency - governments, employers and workers representatives, as well as observers from international organizations and NGOs, from 185 countries to focus on the issues in the world of work that affects us all. Although, this year the focus on the future is high on the agenda, the conference covers a broad range of work-related challenges including unemployment - that affects around 200 million people in the world today - and youth unemployment. The latter in particular continues to be a hot topic as young people are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults and that almost 73 million young people worldwide are looking for work. At the same time, the ILC sets and monitors international labour standards, and this year it will see the launch of a campaign to end modern slavery and an event marking World Day Against Child Labour (12 June), highlighting a child's right to education. All of this takes place in International Geneva, where a number of international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and other members of the UN family, join the International Labour Organization (ILO) in its efforts to promote decent work for everyone. It's clear that the job market in 2050 will be very different than the one we see today. I expect that the on-going outcomes of this annual meeting in conjunction with the work of the entire UN family help shape the future of work into a promising and prosperous one for all."

I never really thought about what that expression meant before, to have “kind eyes.” Whenever I run across someone with a kind and gentle nature, I naturally assume they’ve led a quiet, contended life, mostly-free from the drama and conflict that seem to plague our culture’s most outspoken, especially in a Facebook generation. Quiet, contented, and drama-free, however, are not really words that describe Cook’s past. Sex, rebellion, excommunication, and hedonism might get us closer but are still pale, after all, the first chapter is about an on-stage stripping gig to the song “Sexual” by Amber!The drama of Cook’s life could drink yours under the table, while the conflict of his life would sober you up. The stories in his short memoir Reclaimed are lurid, graphic, funny, devastating, and yet still inspiring. Reclaimed is about Cook’s youth, struggling to find where he--a young gay man of color--belonged in whitewashed and rural Mormon Idaho. He grew up in what’s called one of the reddest areas of the country, where signs on apartment buildings read “approved housing for young ladies” and the local movie theater plays only “family-friendly fare.”The sterile environment of Cook’s youth is a far cry from the groping and touching of his hungry fans in Memphis, and the stories in Reclaimed  beautifully illustrate his life’s vacillation between cold sobriety and sexual intoxication. There are a couple dozen unnumbered chapters that cover milestones in Cook’s search for identity, including stripping, being hit by a car, going on a Mormon mission in Germany, using drugs, being excommunicated by the church, getting expelled from school, and having lots of gay sex. The memoir is short, but it lasts. It will dig into your thoughts. And when I say that all the fucking will make you uncomfortable, I’m not talking about the sex, but about the way our culture fucks with young queer people. As a peek behind the curtain of the secretive Mormon religion, Reclaimed is a devastating example of queer youth failing to find belonging and salvation at the foot of the cross. But Reclaimed is about hope, because Cook makes it through and reclaimed his life. After lots of work and years of therapy, Cook discovered his value and learned how to love himself as though his life depended on it. Reclaimed emerged as a critical step in that journey, “The metamorphosis of Reclaimed was motivational,” Cook writes, “and the writing itself was profoundly cathartic and ultimately healing.”Here’s an excerpt from the chapter, “Mickey”:I was driving to Salt Lake City every weekend (four hours each way) to be around other gay people. I had upgraded my teenage routine of driving to Pocatello, to go to the adult store, where I'd hopefully be cruised by other men. I was too shy at the time to initiate, as I was only 16, but I wasn't carded at the door. A man in his mid-30s stared me down in one of the aisles and nodded his head for me to follow him out the door. He invited me back to his house.I was excited and nervous as I followed him in my car, wondering how my first adult sexual experience would unfold. He had an extensive porn collection in his basement ... boxes and boxes. I would end up staying there a couple of times in the future, not remembering which lie I told my parents for them not to become suspicious of where I was or what I was doing. The man wanted me to fuck him, and I was naive and inexperienced, so he rode my dick as I lay on my back. I was enthralled--not only was I having sex, but I was wanted as well. Porn-runs to Pocatello stopped when my dad caught me watching one at home, my hand down my pants. That was humiliating! He called my bishop immediately for a confessional interview. His memoir also comes in part from his therapist’s encouragement to share his stories for others who may be struggling or for their parents, family members, or friends who want to understand.Since writing Reclaimed, Cook has continued sharing his stories through interviews and various speaking engagements. Last month, he was at Harvard’s Gaypril event “the narrative of out” and will be presenting at the 2015 Affirmation Conference (LGBT Mormons, Families, and Friends) later this year in Utah.What I think I like best about Reclaimed is a distinction film critic Manny Farber made between elephant art and termite art. Elephant art comes in, steps all over you, then stomps out. Termite art creeps in and surrounds you. Before you can even understand its complexity, it burrows a hole inside you and hides out. Before you know it, you’re thinking about it days and weeks and months later. Reclaimed holds you still and encourages you to examine yourself in ways that may make you uncomfortable but are ultimately rewarding. It’s like Cook’s own “kind eyes” in that way. You don’t look away from them, you look into them, and in looking back, they hold you steady and assure you that you belong and are enough.Ray Cook will be the Keynote Speaker at the East Boston Rainbow Flag Raising Ceremony on Monday, June 8 at 6:30 pm in Piers Park."

""Why does my gut tell me that I should go in the opposite direction of what my most trusted Board member advises? This adviser has been a mega-successful, serial entrepreneur and insists on this direction. Even the data backs him up. Still, it just doesn't feel right. Do I trust him as I always have?""As I discuss with Adam the unique context of his business and this decision, I'm also aware that he is in a precarious place in his role as a leader. His uneasy feelings about conflicting with his Adviser are not passing. His intuition is telling him not to go along as he usually does. ""For some reason, I can't read the signals of this situation. I'm usually confident in my decisions but right now, I'm conflicted. What's happening? What's the right answer?""Adam is transforming toward an expanded understanding and experience of himself, which will change his leadership, his organization and his potential for success. Organizations cannot successfully expand without the consciousness of the leader expanding with it. At expansion or strategic inflection points, leaders are faced with decisions that require more of them: more than listening and going along with good counsel, and more than following solid data. Both the leader and the company are moving to a new and unfamiliar place. The ""I don't know what I don't know"" is a painful point in the process because it is hard to know who to trust.As Adam decided to grow his traditionally conservative company from a $30 million to a $60 million business, he had to make decisions about product and service offerings that were less familiar and that required forging new kinds of partnerships. He had to consider infrastructure changes that meant internal relationships would be shifted, in some cases due to job losses. While Adam felt ready to take more risk, he was moving in a direction that did not feel comfortable or ""organizationally safe"" to his trusted Adviser. This is less a conflict of opinion or strategic choice than it is a soul level decision. Is Adam ready to ""live into"" his power and authority through self-trust? Is he ready to stand by his intuition - without clear evidence that this direction is the right one? Is he willing to pay the price of potentially harming or even ending a valued relationship that has been both helpful and profitable to-date? If Adam conforms to his Adviser's counsel and stays in ""known"" territory, his Board relationships would be safer and the data would support his direction. However, this path uses outer-directed decision making and the approval of powerful players as an organizing principle for business growth. It sends the signal that the Adviser is still ""bigger and more powerful"" than the leader. Genuine relationship moves into ""obligation"" and offers less possibility for authentic organizational growth.Advisers are always helpful - sometimes in sorting through strategic decisions, and sometimes sorting through whether you have outgrown your mentor.Adam is currently working through a conscious leadership exercise of how to honor his relationship to his trusted adviser and Board, while delivering the message that his/their counsel will not be followed. He is taking the ultimate risk of staying true to himself, which will undoubtedly prepare him for the next level of leadership that his organization requires to succeed."

With that in mind, I thought I would combine the two in one post about my favorite step-father and my wedding many years ago.When I heard my mother blathering on about Scotty I tuned out. After an absentee father and three step-fathers, plus countless wannabes in between, the last thing I wanted to hear about was her latest man.I quickly learned he had staying power and I could no longer avoid the introduction. To my surprise, I found myself wondering why he was dating my mother. He was charming, funny, intelligent and kind.I think he was there for me, more than her. My life was forever changed after having Scotty in it. He introduced me to reading for pleasure, jazz and classical music, theater and so much more. None of those things interested mom at all, and it didn't matter.The most important introduction was to Dave, who became my husband later that year. The wedding wasn't planned, but it was perfect.Dave began executive training for a major retailer. He was living in Pittsburgh and I moved there to be near him. We quickly learned about transfers.He came to my apartment after work one night and said, ""They've transferred me to Scarsdale, NY and I'm not going alone so we should get married this week.""After my initial shock, I was trying to think where we could possibly put a wedding together that fast. Most states had waiting periods, and my being eighteen would be an issue, too.""Mom got married in Indiana once,"" I said, ""and there was no waiting period.""""Ok, let's check it out,"" Dave said, ""and we can pick up your mom and Scotty on the way.""They were living in Toledo, Ohio, which is close to the Indiana border. It sounded doable to me!When I called my mother the next morning she thought it was a crazy idea, the Indiana part.""I'm pretty sure I can sign for you and you can get married here without a waiting period,"" she said, ""Come out now and we'll figure it out.""She was correct and the plan was underway. Dave's parents had to sign for him, too because he wasn't quite twenty-one. They made it in time and everything was falling into place on the legal end.This is where the wedding planner comes in...aka, Scotty.One of Scotty's best friends was an Episcopal minister. He called him and asked if he had time for a wedding the next day. His friend asked if 5pm would work and it was a go.""Oh,"" his friend asked, ""can they stop by for a pre-marriage counseling session around 2pm this afternoon?""""Sure,"" Scotty replied, ""I'll bring them.""While Dave and I were getting blood tests and papers signed downtown with the parents in the morning Scotty was busy planning every detail.We got back to the house as Scotty was finishing his conversation with the bakery... ""Of course I want the people on top!"" he said.When we arrived for our counseling session at the church I was hoping it wouldn't take long. I wasn't happy with the dress I packed and thought I might go shopping afterward. HA!As the minister went down the list of questions with Dave I had a feeling this might get complicated. Then he turned to me and asked, ""Have you been baptized and confirmed?""""No.""""You haven't been confirmed?"" he asked.""I haven't been baptized either.""""Would you like to be baptized?"" he asked.""Now?!""""Why not,"" he said.Scotty and Dave are my Godparents and I couldn't be prouder. Dave even made sure I was confirmed several years later.It was quite the unconventional affair all the way around, but it was perfect.It was a church wedding with family and flowers and love. The reception was light fare, a beautiful cake with people on top, and champagne. All thanks to Scotty.My mother eventually moved on to her sixth marriage. It didn't last and it didn't matter. But, our relationship with Scotty lasted right up to his death many years later.We heard he was diagnosed with congestive heart disease and he could die at any moment. We drove out to see him right away.It was as if time had stood still. He was the same jovial, loving man we always knew and loved. I was sure they were wrong about his diagnosis. We went out to dinner, hung out with friends, joked and reminisced till the wee hours.When we drove him home I stood outside the car with him for a while. He said, ""Barb if I die tomorrow it has been a great life!""""You're not dying!"" I said, ""I won't have it!""We hugged and tried not to cry.A few weeks later he passed in his sleep. I wasn't shocked but profoundly sad. Yet, at the same time I was so happy we had made the trip, so happy he had been one of the best parts of my life, so happy mom had one good man."

Theodore Hesburgh, inside the Purcell Pavilion at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. Carter Center officials said Sunday, May 10, 2015, that the former President has cut short an election observation visit in Guyana due to health reasons. The statement from the Center says the 90-year-old ex-president is returning to Atlanta. It did not disclose specifics, only saying Carter was ânot feeling well.â(AP Photo/Robert Franklin, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fe652200005700dd86c6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former President Jimmy Carter says he can't see himself running for president in today's political climate, in which an unprecedented influx of new money has come to define the 2016 race for the White House.""I don't think anybody now can hope to be the nominee of the Democratic or Republican Party if they can't raise like a quarter of a billion dollars,"" Carter said in an interview with AARP published Thursday. ""This massive infusion of money automatically polarizes our country. When hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent tearing down the reputation of an opponent in order to get elected, animosity and negativism carries on into Washington.""""There was harmony among congressmen when I was there, and I got just as much support from Republicans as I did from Democrats. I can't imagine myself as a successful candidate today,"" he added.Buoyed by the rise of super PACs, which allow would-be candidates to raise unlimited funds, the 2016 presidential contest is expected to cost upwards of $5 billion. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, is alone expected to spend around $2 billion. On the Republican side, over a dozen or so candidates are sure to add substantially to that number. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is expected to raise $100 million without even announcing his campaign for president -- a tactic some campaign finance experts have described  as flouting the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.In the AARP interview, Carter also said he felt a little sore about not being invited to speak in person at the 2008 Democratic nominating convention in Denver.""I was a little upset at the time, but now I've gotten over it,"" he said."
