0,CRIME,Ferguson Is Rallying Cry For Protests Over Cop Killings,Sebastian Murdock,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ferguson-protests-cop-killings_n_5744076.html,,2014-08-31,"Howard University. Solidarity with Mike Brown. Hand's up don't shoot. Protest against police brutality. August, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2b6132200005700da6e46.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They were killed in Wisconsin, New York and California. Some were shot on the street. One was killed in a Wal-Mart. Another died after being placed in a chokehold. All died at the hands of police and all have been united by one thing: the killing of Michael Brown.Details may differ, circumstances of their deaths may remain unknown, but the outrage that erupted after the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of the unarmed, black 18-year-old by a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri, has become a rallying cry in protests over police killings across the nation.While there's been nothing approaching the violence seen in the St. Louis suburb, demonstrations fueled by a sense of injustice and buoyed with the help of social media have rolled across cities, regardless of whether the shootings took place last week or last month.The spark, said Garrett Duncan, an associate professor of education and African-American studies at Washington University in St. Louis, was how Ferguson police bungled the aftermath of Brown's killing, leading to rioting and looting in the face of a heavily armed police force and, later, the National Guard.""When you leave an 18-year-old boy's body in the street for four hours in a Missouri summer, that's going to trigger something,"" Duncan said. ""The reason it's politicized is we still don't know what's going on. The boy is buried and we still don't know the circumstances.""""Folks exploit these things for one thing or another,"" he said. ""Whether to loot - or get their 15 minutes of fame.""In a culture where the 24/7 news cycle dissects events and often fills the information void with opinion, the topic of police shootings has become polarizing - from the White House to cable shows to Asia.Brown's name and Ferguson have become synonymous with police killings. They have been splashed on signs by protesters, added to hashtags on Twitter and referred to on T-shirts that sport the refrain heard in the city: ""Hands up! Don't shoot.""In Albuquerque, New Mexico, a city facing federal-ordered reforms over excess police force, protesters have begun invoking Brown's name at rallies connected to the city's string of police shootings.David Correia, a critic of city police, said protesters invoked Brown's name because they believe minorities have been targeted in some excessive force cases. Around half of the 41 police shootings involved Hispanic suspects in a city where about half of the residents are Latino.""Although it is true that many of the victims of police shootings here have been the homeless and those struggling with mental illness, that element of racialized police violence is there,"" Correia said.Brown's name has been spoken loudly in Los Angeles where demonstrators peacefully marched, held vigils and confronted police leaders over the Aug. 11 killing of Ezell Ford, a 25-year-old unarmed black man who family members said was mentally ill.Police said he tackled an officer and reached for his gun. News media have reported that witnesses did not see any struggle.With LA's long history of racial tensions between police and the black community - including the deadly violence that followed the acquittal of officers who beat Rodney King - the Los Angeles Police Department has taken a more proactive approach, releasing information and holding public forums.""They've gone on a charm tour with the community,"" said Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable. Still, he said, the same tensions that boiled over in Ferguson lie just beneath the surface in Los Angeles.""While you didn't see the looting and mass demonstrations that you saw in Ferguson, the hostilities, distrust and mistrust between the African-American community and LAPD is still there,"" he said.Brown's death has refocused attention on race in some killings or renewed interest in older cases.The Aug. 5 shooting of a black man holding an air rifle in an Ohio Wal-Mart didn't become a racial issue until after Ferguson blew up with violence. The family of John Crawford III has since called on the U.S. Department of Justice to launch a civil rights probe.In Milwaukee, demonstrators have taken to the streets three weeks in a row to call for federal officials to investigate police brutality against minorities after Dontre Hamilton, a 31-year-old black man who was shot and killed by a white Milwaukee police officer four months ago.In New York, the City Council will review police procedures after a black man suspected of illegally selling cigarettes on the street died after being placed in a chokehold by a white officer.Gina Thayne's nephew, Dillon Taylor, 20, was fatally shot by Salt Lake City police within days of Brown's death. Protesters decried the use of lethal force in Taylor's shooting and others, including Brown's, as well as the outfitting of officers around the nation with military-style gear.Thayne said she participated in the demonstrations, but was reluctant to make a connection between the two cases.""I just want to find out the truth, no matter what it is,"" she said."

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badfedb210000e700c6bf66.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The events in Ferguson demonstrate once again the unsurprising results of a recent empirical study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, that found that ""[p]olice tactics often provoke protesters."" They also remind us how little we retain of lessons that should be learned from past experience.It is extraordinarily troubling that Missouri, St. Louis County and Ferguson government and police officials were so utterly clueless about the fundamentals of dealing with super-heated situations where excessive force and aggressive tactics can turn peaceful mass demonstrations into riots.We have been here before. As Pete Seeger wrote as American embroilment escalated in Vietnam, ""When will they ever learn?""The Berkeley study referenced above summarizes some of the key lessons we have had over time based on the tragic consequences of bull-headed police tactics. To put it bluntly, the authorities were so clueless and clumsy in Ferguson that they did not know they had to act promptly and consistently; be compassionate to the victim's family; and keep themselves and their police from escalating into inflammatory rhetoric and gross misstatement. They acted in ignorance of basic principles: the need to set up and follow a clear and unified command structure; give clear and consistent orders to their forces; coordinate and keep control over all their forces; keep their forces from using no more force or show of force than necessary to contain and control each situation; and keep their forces from provoking or starting violent confrontations with peaceful demonstrators. Instead they deployed uncoordinated police from departments throughout St. Louis County, unnecessarily armed with military weapons and equipment designed for use in war or extreme domestic situations. Their troops arrived in bomb-hardened military vehicles, brandished automatic rifles, and overused tear gas to disperse citizens.The Missouri, St. Louis and Ferguson authorities demonstrated once again that, at least in some parts of America, memories remain far too short about events of the last 50 years, and lessons learned from those events.The Consequences of Excessive ForceHere is where we should have learned about what not to do, from events over the last 50 years alone that were mishandled by politicians, police and National Guard -- painful lessons that were ignored or overlooked by the authorities in Missouri, St. Louis County and Ferguson:Watts, 1965: In August 1965 riots flamed through Los Angeles' African-American Watts neighborhood. Watts became like a war zone. Before calm was restored, 3,900 National Guardsmen, more than 900 LAPD and more than 700 Los Angeles County officers were deployed. More than 30 people were killed, more than 1,000 were injured, and nearly 3,500 were arrested before the riots were quelled. All this was triggered by an inept and unduly forceful police arrest of several African Americans, then fueled by race issues and rumor, and not contained soon enough due to lack of police and government preparation, planning and prompt, measured action.Detroit, 1967: Less than two years later a police raid of an unlicensed bar in Detroit on July 23, 1967, triggered five days of riots in which more than 40 people were killed, more than 1,100 injured, and more than 7,000 arrested. Many of the killed and injured were shot unnecessarily by undisciplined National Guardsmen firing military weapons, often at bystanders. Discipline was imposed and the riots ended only after federal troops were deployed and the National Guard was federalized.Kent State, 1970: In April 1970 anti-war demonstrations and student strikes broke out on many U.S. college campuses in protest of President Richard Nixon's order to bomb of Cambodia during the Vietnam war. Following a riot through the town of Kent, Ohio, and the burning of the ROTC building on the Kent State University campus, Ohio Gov. James Rhodes ordered units of the Ohio National Guard to Kent State. The demonstrations morphed into protests both of the war and of the presence of the National Guard on the campus. On May 3 Gov. Rhodes ramped up the rhetoric, exclaiming at a press conference in Kent:We've seen here, at the city of Kent especially, probably the most vicious form of campus-oriented violence yet perpetrated by dissident groups. They make definite plans of burning, destroying, and throwing rocks at police, and at the National Guard and the Highway Patrol. This is when we're going to use every part of the law-enforcement agency of Ohio to drive them out of Kent. We are going to eradicate the problem. We're not going to treat the symptoms. And these people just move from one campus to the other and terrorize the community. They're worse than the Brownshirts and the communist element and also the Night Riders and the vigilantes.Shortly after noon on May 4, the Guard's commanders ordered the Guardsmen to disperse a crowd of demonstrators and other students who were just going to or from class. The Guardsmen had scant training in controlling civil disorders and were armed with military weapons, with a killing range of over a mile, which they had been ordered to ""lock and load."" They started by dispersing the crowd by marching menacingly at civilians with fixed bayonets and firing tear gas at them. Without warning a unit of the troops fired 67 rounds of ammunition over 13 seconds, most just in the general direction of students and some aimed at particular students. The Guardsmen killed four and wounded nine students.Los Angeles, 1992: On March 3, 1991, LAPD officers were caught on video brutally beating Rodney King after King, an African American, led police on a high-speed chase through Los Angeles County. On April 29, 1992, four white LAPD officers who were involved in beating King were acquitted of violating state law by a jury in police-friendly Simi Valley. Los Angeles and state authorities had no contingency plans to control what happened next. In response to the acquittals, riots started in predominantly African-American South Central Los Angeles. They quickly spread well beyond that neighborhood. Before the riots ended many days later nearly 10,000 National Guard and federal troops were patrolling the streets of Los Angeles; more than 50 people were killed and over 2,000 were injured.The Results of Taking Appropriate ActionHere is what happens when the authorities take (mostly) proper action to quell riots or control mass demonstrations:Detroit, 1967:  In 1965 the first order given by Regular Army General John L. Throckmorton when he took command over all forces in Detroit was ""to have all Guardsmen unload their weapons and put the ammunition in their pockets."" The troops also were ordered to reload their weapons only on orders of an officer, and to stop firing their weapons at looters. The wanton killings and wounding by Guardsman gunfire stopped after that.Martin Luther King assassination, 1968: Riots broke out in many American cities following the April 4, 1968, assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis. In some cities riots were once again suppressed with undue use of deadly force by ill-trained and supervised police and National Guard troops. Unconstitutional mass arrests occurred in many cities. In some cities, however, where politicians were forthright in engaging their African-American communities, or where planning, coordination and proper command-structure controls were employed, riots were avoided or quickly quelled with minimal police or National Guard violence. In several cities riot control worked best when the National Guard was federalized and put under the command of seasoned regular Army generals.Jackson State, 1970: In May 1970 the adjutant general of the Mississippi National Guard kept a tight rein on his troops sent to control demonstrations at Jackson State College that followed the Kent State shootings. Two people were killed and several were wounded, likely by Jackson or Mississippi State Police. None of the Mississippi National Guardsmen shot a civilian.Kent State, 1970: After the Kent State shootings the Department of Defense and its National Guard Bureau took measures to assure that National Guard Troops that are deployed to control civil disorder or demonstrations are properly trained and properly controlled by their officers, and that they do not wantonly fire military weapons at unarmed civilians.Seattle WTO Meeting, 1999: Massive demonstrations that sometimes involved violence by demonstrators were quelled with no loss of life by police gunfire, due to prompt and coordinated action by local and state police and National Guard. Even so, just as in the response in some cities to the 1968 riots following the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination, unconstitutional mass arrests were employed.Many cities, 2011 and 2012: During the Occupy demonstrations in 2011 and 2012, no civilian was killed by police. When police engaged in egregious conduct against civilians, they were swiftly disciplined.What Went Wrong in Ferguson 2014No demonstrator was killed by police in Ferguson (though there were breathtakingly close calls). That seems to have been just plain lucky, given everything that was done wrong by the authorities and police. They appear to have shown no early compassion to Michael Brown's family; they tried ineptly to control the flow of information to the public, including by prematurely pushing out untested versions of the events that led to Michael Brown's killing and by arresting and harassing reporters; they deployed police from many departments throughout St. Louis County without imposing a clear command structure and coordination; they deployed military weapons and equipment prematurely and inappropriately; they did not distinguish between peaceful demonstrations exercising their First Amendment rights and rioters and looters, suppressing both with equal vigor. As in the Watts riots, the government and police department of the City of Ferguson in particular were unprepared for dealing with issues of race that were at large in their community. They failed to recognize or respond to the African-American outrage that resulted in part from the rapid change in the racial demography of Ferguson unmatched by any significant changes in its police department.What Happens Next?Following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the federal government increasingly provided local police with military weapons and equipment unsuited to use in controlling demonstrations and civil disorder. There were shocking images of improper use of such equipment by the police in Ferguson. Why, we have to ask, were the police pointing their military semiautomatic rifles at demonstrators? Why did they even have such weapons so visible? The images of police in Ferguson with too much firepower and too little control and coordination are causing serious reconsideration of this program by conservatives and liberals alike and the federal government. Both Congress and the Obama administration are weighing and reevaluating the situation. Of equal importance, the national conversation about the continued importance of race in America is refocusing on what needs to be done to get us into a post-racial era, which we have not yet reached despite our having an African-American president and an African-American attorney general. For those who may think that Barack Obama's election has moved America into a post-racial era, I say ""nonsense."" Only the politically tone-deaf can believe that much of the hardened opposition to President Obama and his administration is unrelated to his race; only the politically tone-deaf can believe that the hardened opposition to immigration reform is unrelated to race; only the politically tone-deaf can believe that the great divide within the GOP between the old-guard establishment and the nearly lily-white tea-party fringe is unrelated to race; only the politically tone-deaf can believe that use of excessive force by police is unrelated to race; only the politically tone-deaf can believe that the overcrowding of our prisons and jails is unrelated to race; only the politically tone-deaf can believe that continued widespread poverty and the increasing divide between the super-rich and the working poor and middle class in America are unrelated to race.Let's get real, America. Only by acknowledging and dealing with the continued importance of race as a principal underlying cause of our deficiencies can we ever hope to deal with and resolve those defects in our nation."

Pakeha (New Zealanders of European descent) make up 70 percent of the population; about 13 percent are Maori and Pacific Islanders; Asians are 7 percent, people of mixed race are 8 percent. There is no dominant religion: almost 20% profess no particular faith; Anglicans, 15 percent; Roman Catholics 12 percent; Presbyterians 11 percent; and other assorted protestant variations. Literacy is 100 percent, life expectancy is over 80 years of age. Just one major worry: New Zealanders seem to have given up on sex, as population growth rate is a dismal 0.9 percent.  Unlike other European settler countries that almost completely obliterated indigenous identity, culture and languages, New Zealand is exemplary in its efforts to reconcile with the original inhabitants of the islands, the Maori people. Maori is an official language, together with English and New Zealand Sign Language.  Maori, a fiercely proud people, fought off marauding Europeans who landed landed in those far lands, but in 1840 Maori leaders and representatives of the British Crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi, and thus began the formation of New Zealand.   New Zealand's natural beauty is simply breath-taking; and unlike Australia, home to every ugly, poisonous animal on Earth, it is free from all these creatures -- no scorpions or cobras.  Being at the edge of the world was in fact an advantage during the Cold War era. It is so far that even the then ""expansionist"" Soviet Union never considered it to be a valuable asset to be invaded. Distance and isolation always protected it from super-power predators.   Like Australians who died on behalf of the British Empire by the tens of thousands in absurd wars in Asia and Africa, New Zealanders too were sacrificial lambs of the British Crown and imperial US in their foreign wars, from Asia to Africa and Turkey.  While enjoying close ties to the U.S. and Europe, New Zealanders have shown on occasion to be proudly independent. It was in the early 1980s that that postcard islands stood up to the giant US, refusing US Navy port calls over Washington's refusal to confirm or deny if the ships were carrying nuclear weapons. In response, the U.S. cut New Zealand out of its security agreement, ANZUS. New Zealanders also stood up against French nuclear testing in the Pacific Islands. The price they paid for this was the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior ship by French agents in Auckland harbor. New Zealand remains nuclear-free to this day.  About the size of Norway and equally proudly independent in world affairs, New Zealand is one of those few countries that has no dispute with anyone anywhere, was never invaded and never invaded anyone.  Modest and discreet, it doesn't boast about its generous aid contributions -- nearly half a billion dollars in total -- to the region and the rest of the world. Though small, it has made enormous contributions to development, peace and security in our region, in particular in Solomon Islands, Bougainville and Timor-Leste. Both Defence Force personnel and Police were involved in the UN operations in Timor-Leste, and helped contribute towards the stabilisation of my country throughout the difficult post-Independence period.  New Zealand has also deployed peace-keepers far from its shores, including in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, the Sinai, and the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. New Zealand did not send troops to Iraq as that mission did not have UN backing.   New Zealand is also heavily involved in disaster response, especially in the Pacific Islands and in Southeast Asia -- areas particularly vulnerable to cyclones, earthquakes and volcanos.  Why am I so passionately advocating for New Zealand to take a seat in the UN Security Council?  I have been a human rights activist, independence advocate, a diplomat, Foreign Minister, Prime Minister, President, spanning 40 years now; and it has been 40 years of observing, learning and exercising national governing powers as well practicing international diplomacy, being a beneficiary of the United Nations, a victim of the world's indifference but also grateful in the end when indifference changed to care.  In these incredibly challenging times in the Middle East, parts of Africa and Asia, the world needs small and independent countries with New Zealand's record to be sitting in the UN Security Council. And it is important for other small UN member states to see New Zealand win and know that the UN Security Council is accessible for them too.  While a truly global power like the U.S. is indeed an indispensable country, and while major regional powers like China, Russia, Japan, Indonesia, France, Great Britain, Germany, Brazil, Nigeria, South Africa, etc. are equally indispensable, the world needs small countries with decades of active engagement with the world, to facilitate dialogue, mediate and bring parties in wars to the negotiating table.  New Zealand is one such country. I am absolutely confident New Zealand would make profound impact, calming tempers, infusing serenity, proposing workable compromises and sustainable agreements.  Timor-Leste will vote for New Zealand and I hope all other proud UN Member States will do likewise."

European Union leaders have nominated Italy's Mogherini to become the 28-nation bloc's new foreign policy chief for the next five years and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk to succeed European Council President Herman Van Rompuy in December. (Photo by Dursun Aydemir/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13c78230000380093d931.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Adrian Croft and Jan StrupczewskiBRUSSELS, Aug 30 (Reuters) - European Union leaders on Saturday chose Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk to chair their Council and named Italian Federica Mogherini to run the bloc's foreign relations, as the EU prepared to threaten Russia with new sanctions over Ukraine.A summit in Brussels shared the two coveted EU posts between a Kremlin critic from ex-communist Eastern Europe and the foreign minister of one of Moscow's biggest customers for gas. EU officials gave Ukraine's embattled President Petro Poroshenko a warm welcome and assurances of further support.But divisions among the 28 EU nations have hampered action against Moscow, and a draft of the final statement indicated that they will merely ask the bloc's executive arm ""urgently"" to prepare more options for sanctions. Discussion on the measures lasted beyond midnight (2200 GMT).Poroshenko, who warned that a failure of attempts in coming days to end fighting with Russian troops and rebels in the east could lead to ""full-scale war"", said EU leaders had agreed that new sanctions would be conditional on his peace plan working.The appointment of Tusk as president of the European Council marked a major advance in influence for the eastern states who joined the bloc this century and who share non-member Ukraine's concerns about Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambitions.But many of the powerful western countries have hesitated to toughen trade sanctions for fear of damaging their own economies. Some of them, like Italy, are heavily reliant on Russian gas.In her first comments, Mogherini stressed the need to work for a lasting diplomatic deal with Russia.""As we think and we work on the level of sanctions, we also have to keep the diplomatic way open ... hoping that the combination, a wise combination, can be effective,"" she said.Ex-communist states had deadlocked an earlier summit two months ago by opposing Mogherini as too soft on Russia.The move of Tusk, a former student activist in the anti-Communist Solidarity movement, will force an upheaval in the government in Warsaw ahead of an election due next year.In Brussels, he pledged to address British Prime Minister David Cameron's concerns over growing EU powers and immigration from eastern Europe to help avoid London quitting the Union.Tusk will work closely with Jean-Claude Juncker, the incoming head of the EU's executive Commission. Cameron tried to block Juncker's appointment in June, fearing the former Luxembourg premier's federalist views would alienate Britons.""WAR AGAINST EUROPE""French President Francois Hollande stressed that a failure by Russia to reverse a flow of weapons and troops into eastern Ukraine would force the bloc to impose new economic measures.""Are we going to let the situation worsen, until it leads to war?"" Hollande said at a news conference. ""Because that's the risk today. There is no time to waste.""The president of formerly Soviet Lithuania, an outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin and of EU hesitation to challenge him, called for urgent military supplies to Kiev and a tougher arms embargo on Russia. Dalia Grybauskaite said Moscow, by attacking Ukraine, was effectively ""in a state of war against Europe"".Poroshenko gave short shrift to Moscow's denials by denouncing the past week's incursion of thousands of troops with hundreds of armored vehicles and said he expected the summit to order the European Commission to prepare a new set of sanctions.But, like Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, he used their joint news conference to stress the importance of finding a political solution to a crisis that Putin blames on Kiev's drive to turn the ex-Soviet state away from its former master Moscow and toward an alliance with the EU and NATO.He said he was not looking for foreign military intervention and hoped for a ceasefire deal as early as Monday, when representatives of Moscow, Kiev and the EU meet.""I think we are very close to the point of no return,"" he said. ""The point of no return is full-scale war, which already happened on the territory controlled by separatists."" DEAL DONEThe appointments of Tusk and Mogherini balance the interests of left- and right-wing factions across the bloc, eastern and western states, northern Europe and the south, as well as satisfying some pressure for more women in senior EU roles.Tusk, a conservative easterner, replacing the Belgian Herman Van Rompuy; Mogherini from the center left takes over as the bloc's foreign policy chief, replacing Briton Catherine Ashton.Mogherini dismissed suggestions she was too young and inexperienced at 41 and pledged to speak for a ""new generation"" of Europeans to promote peace in the region and beyond.Tusk will also chair summits of the euro zone countries, even though Poland has yet to adopt the common EU currency.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that was a mark of the leaders' determination to ""show unity"" and avoid the Union splitting between the 18 states using the euro and the other 10.Other elements in striking a deal on the top jobs will be understandings reached on further key roles in the Commission, which will be formed in the coming weeks by Juncker.Having failed to block the appointment of Juncker, whom he sees as too keen on centralizing powers in Brussels, it was Cameron who last week made Tusk's candidacy public. This came at the expense of the previous frontrunner for the Council presidency, center-left Danish premier Helle Thorning-Schmidt.Britain, France, Germany and other countries are competing to see their nominees secure important portfolios in Juncker's team, such as in economic affairs, trade and energy supply.The horse-trading over jobs underlines the power of rival national governments over the supranational institutions of the EU. Proponents of a strong political leadership in Brussels that can inspire and rally an increasingly skeptical European public behind the common project may again be left disappointed.Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said on Friday he would propose a meeting to discuss tackling the ""really worrying"" economic situation across Europe, with growth and jobs elusive and fears of a new crisis for the euro currency.The leaders agreed to schedule that summit for Oct. 7, according to the draft statement.Germany, the leading economic power, has given signs this week of softening its opposition to calls from Italy and France for more leeway to stimulate growth by government spending. The leaders may make statements on the issue on Saturday.Hollande said EU states had to invest to promote growth and to use ""all possible flexibilities"" in the treaties that set up the currency union so that efforts to meet obligations to curb public deficits were adapted to foster economic growth.

Attorney General Tom Horne -- plagued by a campaign finance investigation, rumors of an extra-marital affair and a hit-and-run car accident -- lost the GOP primary to Mark Brnovich. The defeat in Tuesday’s election, which Horne did not conceded until the following day, came in the same round of primary elections on Tuesday that ousted the state Superintendent of Public Instruction John Huppenthal, the other major figure behind the fight against Mexican-American studies. Horne faces several investigations over allegations that he broke election and campaign finance laws, according to the Arizona Republic. Brnovich is an immigration hardliner who opposes “amnesty” and said on the campaign trail that he’d support outgoing Gov. Jan Brewer’s decision to withhold driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants. Before serving as attorney general, Horne headed the state school system as superintendant of Public Instruction, where he led a conservative-backed effort to ban a Mexican-American studies curriculum at Tucson schools. An independent audit and education researchers credited the program with developing critical thinking schools and boosting student achievement. But Horne said the courses, which focused on controversial issues like racism and socioeconomic inequality and widely used books written by Latino authors, bred resentment against whites. The Arizona legislature passed a bill in 2010 banning courses that promote the overthrow of the government, foster ethnic solidarity or are aimed at people of a specific ethnicity. The following year, John Huppenthal, who replaced Horne as head of the state school system, declared Tucson out of compliance with the law and threatened to withhold 10 percent of the city’s education budget unless it discontinued the classes. Tucson Unified School District’s board voted to cancel the classes in December of 2011. Students of the banned classes have filed a lawsuit challenging the ethnic studies law which has been appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. "

But no decent country can support the horrors perpetrated by ISIS, and no civilized country should shirk its responsibility to help stamp out this disease.""Republicans and Democrats in Congress have called for lawmakers to vote on whether the United States should broaden its action against Islamic State.Two prominent Republicans criticized Obama on Saturday for saying the United States has not yet developed a strategy for confronting Islamic State in Syria.In an opinion piece also published on the op-ed page of Saturday's New York Times, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham called Obama's statement on Thursday ""startling"" and ""dangerous"" and said the threat from Islamic State requires ""a far greater sense of urgency"" than the administration is showing.McCain and Graham, in an essay headlined ""Stop Dithering, Confront ISIS,"" suggested revising the Authorization for Use of Military Force so it could be used for evolving terrorism threats like Islamic State.That would negate any need for members of Congress to approve specific military action against the group, or suffer the consequences of such a decision.

Republicans tried that at first when Romney was caught on the 47% tape, but it didn't work for them because it wasn't only what Romney said that was so offensive, it was the context: speaking to a bunch of wealthy donors about all those greedy seniors and poor people.  Sounds familiar.  The spectacle of Mitch McConnell, Joni Ernst, Cory Gardner, Tom Cotton, the head of the Republican Governors Association (and other politicians who were on the agenda or in attendance) kowtowing to Charles and David Koch and other billionaires gathered at the luxury resort. All the money spent on security ($870,000 to rent the hotel exclusively not to mention their own private security detail) to keep the meeting as secretive as possible. And Mitch McConnell, the most powerful man in the Republican party as the Senate Minority Leader, giving a speech outlining how his entire career, and the party's future policy strategy, were all in service to the Koch agenda. The combination will be as definitional to this campaign as the 47% video was to 2012.  And this won't just make an impact in the four Senate races which have gotten all the publicity so far. This is going to help define the national narrative for the 2014 campaign: these tapes make 100% clear that the modern Republican party is controlled by the Kochs and their billionaire friends. The Kochs invite the most powerful party leaders, the most important candidates, to their ""seminars,"" and they all come running. These politicians thank the Kochs and their billionaire friends profusely, talk about how they wouldn't be where they are today without them, and then tell them how they will battle on their behalf if they win.  Mitch McConnell, speaking of the Republican party, said, ""I want to start by thanking you, Charles and David, for the important work you're doing. I don't know where we'd be without you."" Joni Ernst made absolutely clear, multiple times, that she would never had a chance to win her primary without the donors in the room. Tom Cotton thanked the billionaire financiers for reviving the Republican party in his state, and Cory Gardner begged them to invest heavily not only in Colorado but in the entire Rocky Mountain region, which was ""ripe"" for them to come in and exploit.  Notice that these candidates come from all over the country - the South, the West, the Midwest. The Koch donor network has a broad and deep reach. They control the Republican party from sea to shining sea.  The Koch brothers have made clear their agenda. They don't believe in climate change, and want no regulations on their oil companies. They want their taxes reduced to almost nothing since they, after all, are the ""job creators."" They oppose reform and regulation of Wall Street. They don't believe in a minimum wage, or unemployment compensation, or student loans, or Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. They think public education should be privatized and turned over to the corporate sector.  And what the 47% recording, and the Koch conference recordings, confirm with 100% certainty, is that this is the same agenda, with the same values, shared by Republican politicians.  The Kochs and their millionaire/billionaire friends in that luxury hotel in Orange County, California are now in control of the Republican party- lock, stock, and barrel. And that is the narrative, confirmed on tape, of the 2014 election. Mitch McConnell is right: the GOP would be nowhere without the Koch brothers. The Republicans know where their bread is buttered, and will dance with the ones who brung 'em."

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, in which dozens were wounded.A pattern of bold offensives by militants has emerged across Afghanistan in recent weeks during the summer ""fighting season.""It coincides with political deadlock in the capital, Kabul, where rival presidential candidates have failed to resolve months-long disputes over an election meant to mark the first democratic transfer of power in Afghan history.Most foreign combat troops are due to leave by the end of 2014 but the election dispute has meant a prolonged delay in signing a security pact with the United States governing how many troops would remain.On Saturday, the insurgents struck in the western province of Farah, stopping a truck carrying workers to a construction site near the Iranian border and killing 11 of them. Authorities were trying to find out why the workers were targeted.""They were innocent Afghan workers. They did not have any connection to the government, so we don't know the reason for the attack,"" said Jawad Afghan, a spokesman for the provincial governor. NEW TRENDAs the political impasse drags on, the Taliban-led insurgency has focused on important tactical and symbolic targets as a challenge to the Afghan security forces who are taking over from their NATO-led counterparts.Afghan forces have struggled to fight off large numbers of insurgent fighters in provinces to the east, north and south of Kabul.""This is part of an alarming trend across the country,"" said Graeme Smith, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group in Kabul. Taliban offensives ""are longer in duration, bigger in size and against more ambitious targets than we've seen previously.""In northern Kunduz province, security forces were in a stand-off with insurgents in a weeks-long battle for control over the province that was the last Taliban stronghold before they were driven out by the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in 2001.""The insurgents are better armed than us,"" said Kunduz police chief Mustafa Mohseni. ""They use heavy machine guns, RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades) and 82mm rockets against our forces.""A Kunduz police spokesman said security forces were concentrated on a district just next to the provincial capital. Many Kunduz residents have fled to nearby provinces to escape the violence and some who remained show little enthusiasm for the government's effort to hold back the insurgents.""There is no job, no security, no life,"" said Kunduz shopkeeper Sayed Malek. ""We don't care if the Taliban come back and take over the whole country. We want a peaceful life.""

(AP) — A Mississippi woman was convicted Friday of murder in connection to illicit silicone buttocks injections that led to a Georgia woman's death.The state attorney general's office said in a statement that a jury deliberated about five hours before finding Tracey Lynn Garner, 54, guilty of depraved-heart murder and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the 2012 death of Karima Gordon, 37. The murder conviction carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.""We felt confident that the evidence would lead to a conviction,"" said Attorney General Jim Hood in a statement. ""We hope this verdict will deliver some sense of justice for Ms. Gordon's family.""Judge Winston Kidd set sentencing for Tuesday. Garner was immediately taken into custody after the verdict was read.Her attorney, John M. Collette, in an email, said he could not comment on the case because a gag order remained in effect.Gordon, an Atlanta-area resident, died eight days after receiving the injections in 2012.Prosecutors said Gordon's death was caused by injections that Garner administered. They said Gordon was referred to Garner by Natasha Stewart, an adult entertainer also known as Pebbelz Da Model. Stewart was convicted of manslaughter in February and is serving a seven-year prison sentence.The prosecution said Stewart told Gordon that Garner was a nurse.During the trial, Colette suggested that Gordon wanted exactly what Garner had to offer.""She wanted this underground, bargain basement butt enhancement,"" Colette said.He also stated that Gordon had other injections that could have caused her death, and argued that the silicone found in Gordon's body didn't match silicone seized from Garner's Jackson home.""We don't know how much she'd gotten before she ever came to Mississippi,"" Colette said. ""What silicone caused her death?""Authorities initially identified Garner as a man, Morris Garner, after the arrest. Her attorney has said Garner was born male and had sex reassignment surgery.Garner still faces similar charges in the 2010 death of Marilyn Hale, of Selma, Alabama. The trial date in that case has not yet been set.Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed."
