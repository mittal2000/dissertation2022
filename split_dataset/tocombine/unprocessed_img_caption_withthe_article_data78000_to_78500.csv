0,WOMEN,Why Patricia Arquette Says We're 'Lying To Our Daughters When We Tell Them They Can Do Anything',Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-patricia-arquette-says-were-lying-to-our-daughters-when-we-tell-them-they-can-do-anything_us_55fb5288e4b00310edf685bf,The actress speaks out against the gender wage gap in Silicon Valley.,2015-09-18,Patricia Arquette made an impassioned plea for wage equality during the 2015 Academy Awards.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55fb53011c00002500082717.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Patricia Arquette has taken her fight for equal pay from Tinseltown to Silicon Valley.On Thursday, the Oscar-winning actress sat down with Noreen Farrell, the executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, at the Dreamforce Women's Leadership Summit, part of Salesforce's annual conference in San Francisco. In front of a predominantly female audience -- a rare sight at the seemingly male-dominated conference -- the two women discussed how the wage gap has harmed women across the board.""The actions that we need to take for women right now around the world have to be radical, unnatural readjustments,"" Arquette said.Arquette has become one of the nation's leading advocates for equal pay after turning her 2015 Academy Award acceptance speech into a rallying cry for closing the gender wage gap, calling for ""wage equality once and for all, and equal rights for women in the United States of America."" She's since advocated for California's Fair Pay Act, which Gov. Jerry Brown is expected to soon sign into law.She continued that crusade during Thursday's talk, pointing out how lower wages hurt women at every stage of their lives. ""We are kind of lying to our daughters when we tell them they can do anything,"" she said. ""Economically, girls are going to crash their heads against the glass ceiling and get cut up in the process.""Arquette's talk was part of a daylong series of panels highlighting the challenges women face in the workplace and efforts in the tech industry to increase female representation and leadership. It's the latest step Salesforce has taken toward improving gender diversity in the technology. Earlier this year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff announced he would review each of his employees' salaries to ensure men and women are paid equally for equal work.Women have always been severely underrepresented in tech, and the situation has only grown worse in Silicon Valley's app-driven boom. According to a study released earlier this year by the American Association of University Women, just 26 percent of computing jobs in 2013 were held by women, down from 30 percent in 1990. For the women who do make it into the industry, the turnover rate is alarmingly high -- a 2008 Harvard study found that 56 percent of women in tech will leave their jobs midcareer. And while the wage gap is smaller in tech than in other industries, women in tech are still making 89 percent of what their male counterparts earn.Farrell and Arquette discussed those points on Thursday, lamenting the lack of women in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley's top firms.""As a consumer of tech products, I do want to see what women come up with,"" Arquette said, ""If you're losing such a vast amount of women, you're going to lose things that are very important, and that's unfortunate for people in the future.""Arquette also discussed how the wage gap is much worse for women of color -- a fact she was criticized for not bringing up during her now-famous Oscar speech. While women overall make an average of 78 cents for every dollar earned by a man, the wage gap is significantly wider for black and Hispanic women. Black women earn an average of 64 percent of what white men make, while Hispanic women make just 54 cents on the dollar compared to white men.""That's not the America I want,"" she said.She also noted the importance of women self-identifying as feminists, acknowledging she didn't always feel comfortable with the label.""I wasn't raised self-identifying as a feminist. A lot of people around me acted like it was a witches' coven where, you ate male babies or something like that,"" she said to much laughter in the audience. ""Later, I learned that feminism means people believe women should have equal rights.""Arquette's change in heart was mirrored by Thursday's audience. At the beginning of the talk, Ferrell asked everyone in the audience who would call themselves a feminist to raise their hand. About three-quarters of the audience responded affirmatively. She asked the same question at the very end of the session and almost everyone in the room had their hand raised.Arquette also pointed out that few women in college call themselves ""the f-word."" That, she said, needs to change.""When we disenfranchise each other and we don't claim this word, and with this word claim that we believe women should have equal rights in the United States... we really dilute our own message and we dilute our own power,"" she said.Also on HuffPost:"

Clinton has said she's waiting for President Barack Obama's decision to render her judgment, telling a voter in July that she doesn't want to ""second-guess"" the president.But at an event in New Hampshire on Thursday night, Clinton said she ""can't wait too much longer"" for a decision on Keystone. ""I'm putting the White House on notice. I'm going to tell you what I think soon, because I can't wait,"" she said.Anti-Keystone activists can't wait, either -- as this photo from Clinton's campaign stop at the University of New Hampshire on Friday shows. In the photo, Clinton poses with Griffin Sinclair-Wingate, a 20-year-old student at the college and a volunteer for the group 350 Action, which has led the campaign against Keystone.

His father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, said Thursday that Ahmed will transfer out of the high school; the family is “still deciding where he will go next,” reports The Associated Press.Ahmed was arrested on Monday after teachers became suspicious of the homemade clock that he’d brought to school.“I built the clock to impress my teacher, but when I showed it to her, she thought it was a threat to her. It was really sad that she took the wrong impression from it,” the teen said in an interview this week.Ahmed was eventually arrested by police and taken from the school in handcuffs. He was sent to a detention center, and later released to his parents.Ayisha Mohamed, Ahmed’s 17-year-old sister, said her “heart just dropped” when she heard about her brother’s arrest. But, she told the AP: “It was a bad thing that turned into a blessing.”This week, Ahmed has become something of a media superstar. Netizens have rallied around the teen, with the hashtags #IStandWithAhmed and #EngineersForAhmed getting hundreds of thousands of posts and tweets. He’s also been deluged with words of support and affirmation from some of the biggest names in politics, science and tech.Earlier this week, President Barack Obama extended an invitation to Ahmed to visit the White House (which the teen gratefully accepted), while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told him to “stay curious and keep building.”Facebook, Google, Twitter and Box all reached out to the teen, and on Wednesday, top astrophysicist Chanda Prescod-Weinstein told him that he’s exactly the “kind of student we want at places like MIT,” a university that Ahmed has called his “dream school.”“Having the skill and ambition to build something cool should lead to applause, not arrest. The future belongs to people like Ahmed,” Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday.According to reports, MacArthur High School has not apologized to Ahmed for the arrest, but has defended the actions of its staff.“We do stand behind what the teacher did,” the school spokeswoman told ABC News. She added that Ahmed's punishment for bringing the clock to school -- suspension for three days -- had not been lifted. “Even though that particular item did not pose an immediately dangerous situation to the school, we cannot allow items on campus that can be perceived to pose a threat,” she said. Earlier this week, The Verge published a memo that was allegedly sent out by the school to students' parents. In it, Principal Dan Cummings wrote that local police had responded on Monday to a “suspicious-looking item” on campus. He then encouraged parents to use “this opportunity to talk with your child about the Student Code of Conduct and specifically not bringing items to school that are prohibited.” “This is a good time to remind your child how important it is to immediately report any suspicious items and/or suspicious behavior,"" he added.Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne defended law enforcement and school officials for their actions against Ahmed.“To the best of my knowledge, they followed protocol,” she wrote on Facebook.

It also enables the vehicle to detect when it's undergoing emissions testing, turning on emissions controls only during the test.Essentially, the vehicle ""knows"" when it’s being tested, and fools the system when in the lab or testing station, the EPA said. But in day-to-day driving, the vehicle emits nitrogen oxide well over the allowed amount, contributing to ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter emissions and worsening pollution.“Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health,” said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. “Working closely with the California Air Resources Board, EPA is committed to making sure that all automakers play by the same rules.” The device affected nearly 500,000 cars sold in the U.S. since 2008 -- specifically, the Jetta, Beetle, Golf, Passat and Audi A3 models.Despite the notice, EPA did not order Volkswagen to issue a recall, and said it is giving manufacturers a reasonable amount of time to craft a plan to repair the cars. As a result, it could take at least one year for the agency to identify the steps Volkswagen will have to take and determine if a recall is needed.California regulators also hit Volkswagen with a compliance notice.“Our goal now is to ensure that the affected cars are brought into compliance, to dig more deeply into the extent and implications of Volkswagen’s efforts to cheat on clean air rules, and to take appropriate further action,” said Richard Corey, executive officer of the California Air Resources Board.

And then The Donald himself went on to repeat the widely discredited claim that vaccines cause autism, and nobody called him out.""CNN was irresponsible to even bring that up,"" journalist Ana Marie Cox said on HuffPost's ""So That Happened"" Podcast. ""If you even talk about the vaccine debate you give it credence.""During a political dustup over vaccine quackery earlier this year, Cox reported for The Daily Beast that letting childhood immunizations become a polarized political topic could be bad for public health. The problem occurs when people who previously might not have had bad feelings toward immunization begin ""to incorporate how they feel about vaccines into their political world view.""On Wednesday night, Trump, Carson and Rand Paul agreed it would be good to slow the schedule of immunizations given to children.“I’m for vaccines, but I’m also for freedom,"" Paul said. ""Even if the science doesn’t say bunching them up is a problem, I ought to be able to spread my vaccines out a little bit at the very least.""Public health experts and autism advocacy groups do not agree. The American Academy of Pediatrics notes the autism-vaccine link and the supposed benefits of delayed immunizations have been roundly debunked. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says delaying children's immunizations just prolongs their vulnerability to potentially lethal illness.Alison Singer, president and co-founder of the Autism Science Foundation, called the debate over autism dangerous, pointing to the measles outbreak in California this year as an example of what happens when kids don't get their shots.""This idea that we can space out the vaccines is not grounded in science,"" Singer said in an interview. ""A lot of people don't understand why children get so many vaccines. The reason is we're now able to protect children from so many diseases from which they used to die.""The Autism Self Advocacy Network said in a statement that the focus on vaccines has led to too much research on what causes autism and not enough on autism among adults. The network also said candidates were essentially arguing it would be better to expose children to deadly diseases than autism. ""Vaccinations do not cause autism – but the use of autism as a means of scaring parents from safeguarding their children from life-threatening illness demonstrates the depths of prejudice and fear that still surrounds our disability.""

""A lot of people are saying there are bad things happening out there. We're going to be looking at that and a lot of other things.""Trump in 2011 notably called into question Obama's citizenship and demanded that the president release his birth certificate to prove that he was born in the United States. Obama later did, yet Trump continued to dispute the facts, including the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate.Other GOP presidential candidates have handled such questions very differently. In 2008, then-GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) calmly corrected a woman who went on an anti-Muslim rant at a town hall. When the women alleged that she could not trust Obama because he ""is an Arab,"" McCain stopped her.“No, ma’am, he’s a decent family man [and] citizen who I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.

8,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Some Republicans Less Likely to Support Donald Trump Out Loud,"Mark Blumenthal, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-donald-trump-support_us_55fc060de4b00310edf699a9,"Some Republicans may be reluctant to share their support for Donald Trump with a stranger on the telephone. Bernie Sanders' poll support matches where Barack Obama stood at this time in 2007, but there's a catch. And a Republican pollster warns that voter discontent could spur primary upsets. This is HuffPollster for Friday, September 18, 2015",2015-09-18,2015-09-18-1442577011-5567586-nationaltrumpmode.png,http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-18-1442577011-5567586-nationaltrumpmode.png,"'MODE EFFECT' APPARENT IN TRUMP POLLING - The involvement of an interviewer appears to dampen support for Donald Trump slightly in surveys on the 2016 Republican race, according to a chart prepared by Democratic research analyst Jon Robinson. “Trump support among polls without an interviewer has been anywhere from five to ten points higher than in polls with interviewers since Trump’s rise in the polls began in July,” Robinson writes. No other Republican or Democratic candidate sees their support affected in this way.Robinson’s chart begins with all national public polls on the Republican race compiled by HuffPost Pollster and divides them into two categories: Those that used live callers for some or all interviewers and those that “had no interviewer whatsoever involved in the process,” including both internet and automated telephone polls. The chart uses a loess regression to plot smoothed trend lines for each category of poll weighted to reflect their sample sizes (with each dot representing a poll and the size of the dot proportional to the number of interviews conducted).Natalie Jackson, HuffPost’s Senior Data Scientist, modified Robinson’s chart to display bands showing the potential for variation based on random chance alone. The lack of overlap between the two bands throughout much of August indicates a statistically meaningful difference between live interview and automated or internet polls in measuring Trump’s support. (Robinson also produced similar charts for other candidates, although the mode differences for these were not statistically significant).Jackson also applied the chart format to polls on the Republican race conducted in Iowa and New Hampshire. New Hampshire shows a mode effect similar to the national polls, but the evidence is weaker. There have been only five polls without interviewers released in the state – and these were spread out across the timeline – so the loess routine can’t calculate a confidence interval for that line. Trump’s numbers in Iowa don’t show a clear trend for polls with interviewers compared to polls without interviewers at all. After mid-July the no-interviewer polls show slightly higher estimates for Trump, but the confidence intervals completely overlap for much of that time – which means that statistically speaking there might not be a difference.Since the polls examined also involve a mix of sampling methods, it is possible that some of the differences reflect differences in the voters sampled and not just differences in the way they were interviewed. That said, as Robinson explains, the differences in polling on Trump is consistent with findings of a study released earlier this year by the Pew Research Center, which found similar patterns in a wide variety of different topics that were based entirely on whether respondents were interviewed with or without an interviewer. These “mode effects” were consistent with theory that respondents sometimes modify their answers because they are interacting with another person.Robinson: “In the Pew research this showed up in two interesting ways. One, respondents showed less favorable opinions about politicians in general in the online setting than on the phone. They also registered lower levels of satisfaction with family life and were less likely to perceive that certain groups are discriminated against. All three of these question topics are ones where we might expect that being in a social situation with an interviewer (even an anonymous one over the phone) might ‘bias’ a response in the direction of seeming 1) less angry about political leaders, 2) more satisfied with life in general, and 3) holder of less controversial statements than they might reveal otherwise. All of these things exist supposedly because of the perceived (even if it is silent) judgement of an interviewer and it’s exactly what we see illustrated in the graphic below.""The most important question is where the truth lies. The researchers at the Pew Center had no way to determine the accuracy of most of the measures they tested, though as they point out, ""previous research examining questions for which the true value is known have found that self-administered surveys generally elicit more accurate information than interviewer-administered surveys."" And, of course, votes in primary elections are cast with a secret ballot (party caucuses are an exception, although Iowa's Republican caucuses typically involve paper ballots).SANDERS POLLING THE SAME AS OBAMA WAS THIS TIME IN 2007: A chart created by Chad Murphy, an associate professor at the University of Mary Washington, which showed Bernie Sanders was polling at the same rate against Hillary Clinton as Barack Obama was polling against her in 2007 drew some buzz on twitter earlier this week.Sanders' polling might match that of Obama's, but he continues to face disadvantages that Obama did not. For starters, Obama's eventual strong position among black voters in primary states largely helped him win in 2008. Comparatively, a recent YouGov poll shows that Sanders is only capturing 11 percent of black primary voters to Clinton's 53 percent. A Gallup poll of black Americans shows that 80 percent of black Americans are favorable towards her, while just 23 percent are favorable towards Sanders; 33 percent say they're not even familiar with him.Endorsements also separate Sanders from Obama. This time in 2007, while Clinton had a substantial number of endorsements Obama was able to gather 36 from members of Congress. This cycle, according to The Hill, Clinton has gathered 118 endorsements from members of Congress while Sanders has not received a single endorsement. Fundraising is another issue for Sanders. In 2007, Obama was running nearly even with Clinton on money raised. This cycle, according to FiveThirtyEight, Clinton has captured 73 percent of all the money raised by Democrats while Sanders has only received 23 percent. Additionally, Hillary has immense super PAC power behind her, while Sanders has warded them off. Does Sanders still have a shot? - Chad Murphy (via email): ""The party likes to decide the nominee, and we've seen the establishment firmly behind Hillary in a way they weren't in 2007. That being said, we're seeing a clear rejection of the party favorites on the Republican side, and we may be seeing something similar happening for the Democrats as well….And if Hillary's inevitability starts to disappear, we might see the party loyalists searching for someone new.""WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE 'AIN'T EXACTLY CLEAR' - Republican pollster Glen Bolger: ""Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are, to quote Dennis Green, who we thought they were. Instead, it is the voters who are driving this. And, that’s who Republican members of Congress need to focus on – not the candidates in the Presidential race, but the voters who are angry and unhappy with the direction of the country.The current discontent is the result of eleven straight years of wrong track pessimism in national polling. This is the longest period of pessimism ever measured. The status quo – which by and large means incumbents – is something voters are weary of. There is also a sense that while Americans are working harder than ever, they are treading water financially. They believe the deck is stacked against them by politics and politicians, big business and bankers, the media, and other American AND world institutions. Problems are going unsolved, whether it is the border, the economy, the War on Terror, the cost of higher education, and others. his has created a political environment that encourages primary challenges and election upsets.""

Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) says Pope Francis should focus on fighting climate change ""in his personal time.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585811c0120000590eef0162.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) is boycotting Pope Francis’ address to Congress next week because of reports that His Holiness plans to focus on the “fool’s errand of climate change.”In a Thursday op-ed on the conservative website Townhall.com, the Arizona Republican said he doesn’t want to listen to the pope talk about climate change, since the planet’s climate has been changing “since first created in Genesis” in the Bible.“If the Pope plans to spend the majority of his time advocating for flawed climate change policies, then I will not attend,” Gosar wrote. “When the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one.”He also said the pope’s calls to action on climate change sound more like “socialist talking points” than the teachings of a faith leader. Gosar said he has a moral obligation to call out the pope for ignoring more pressing issues, like the persecution of Christians.“If the Pope wants to devote his life to fighting climate change then he can do so in his personal time,” he said. “But to promote questionable science as Catholic dogma is ridiculous.”Scientists have already established that human activity causes climate change. Global warming stems largely from greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.Pope Francis has made strong statements about the effects of climate change, writing in his second papal encyclical that it is “one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.”"
12,POLITICS,"America, The Next Hobby Lobby Case Is Heading For The Supreme Court",Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-birth-control_us_55fb6a8be4b08820d918230a,The justices could again weigh women's health care against religious liberty.,2015-09-18,"In a case out of the 10th Circuit, the Little Sisters of the Poor are also challenging the contraceptive accommodation on the grounds of religious liberty.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_23_223_2937_1737%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal appeals court on Thursday became the first in the nation to rule that the so-called contraceptive accommodation under the Affordable Care Act violated the religious beliefs of a nonprofit organization.Seven other federal appellate courts have already rejected similar challenges, and lawyers in those cases are seeking Supreme Court review. Thursday's decision all but guarantees that the justices will step in and settle the dispute.The conflict arises from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, a topic the Supreme Court also grappled with in its controversial Hobby Lobby decision. And that earlier ruling plays into the latest dispute.The contraceptive mandate generally requires employers to provide female workers with insurance coverage for a range of birth control methods and related services at no cost to the workers. Churches and other legally defined ""religious employers"" are exempt from the mandate outright, but nonprofits and other organizations with religious objections aren't.Federal regulations provide an ""accommodation"" to the latter groups: Fill out a form, note your religious objections to the contraceptive mandate, and then let the government and your insurance provider sort out how to provide the necessary coverage to your employees. Some nonprofits have a problem with even filling out the form. In their view, the very act of opting out of the mandate is akin to being complicit in providing birth control -- which, in turn, violates their deeply held religious beliefs. On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit agreed in two combined cases that the accommodation process itself imposed a ""substantial burden"" on the beliefs of four organizations -- a Christian services provider and its affiliated college, and two other religious colleges -- because of the prospect of ""significant monetary penalties"" if they didn't comply with a process they believe leads to the immoral acts. In particular, the plaintiffs point to certain forms of contraception that they believe to be ""functionally equivalent to abortion on demand.""The St. Louis-based court said it wasn't its place to judge the sincerity of those beliefs.""It is not our role to second-guess [the nonprofits'] honest assessment of a difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy,"" Judge Roger Wollman wrote for the court, ""namely, the circumstances under which it is wrong for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another."" With this language, the 8th Circuit split from seven other circuit courts, all of which have ruled in favor of the federal government. Last month, for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit tossed a lawsuit from a group of nonprofits associated with the Roman Catholic Church who also complained that the contraceptive accommodation burdened their religious beliefs because it implicated them in something they considered to be at odds with their faith.The Manhattan-based court didn't doubt the sincerity of that belief, but still concluded that it had the authority to judge whether the burden of filling out the form, ""as an objective legal matter,"" was substantial.""Whether the regulation objected to imposes a substantial burden is an altogether different inquiry"" from the beliefs themselves, the 2nd Circuit said. The former is chiefly for the courts to decide, or else the system would be flooded with all kinds of religious claims that could not be judged.Here is where the 8th Circuit relied on an entirely different reading of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the 2014 Supreme Court case that extended religious accommodations to closely held for-profit corporations with similar objections to Obamacare's birth control mandate. In the 8th Circuit's eyes, Hobby Lobby seems to provide religious objectors with carte blanche to decide for themselves which government regulations count as substantial burdens on their religious liberty.""The question here is ... whether they have a sincere religious belief that their participation in the accommodation process makes them morally and spiritually complicit in providing abortifacient coverage,"" Wollman wrote. ""Their affirmative answer to that question is not for us to dispute.""A spokesperson for the White House said it was ""disappointed"" in the ruling and declared that ""the contraceptive accommodation process strikes the proper balance between ensuring women have equal access to healthcare and protecting religious beliefs.""The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represented Hobby Lobby Stores in its winning challenge, is already looking forward to a new showdown.""The government keeps telling the Supreme Court, 'Move along, nothing important here,' in hopes that the Court will ignore this crucial issue,"" said Lori Windham, senior counsel for the Becket Fund, in a statement on Thursday. ""But with today's decisions, the Court will have great reason to decide this issue in the next term.""The Becket Fund has filed briefs in the other appeals before the Supreme Court, which could decide by late September whether any of them is worth taking up."
13,BUSINESS,Janet Yellen Explains How The Fed Reduces Income Inequality,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/janet-yellen-income-inequality_us_55fc61b4e4b0fde8b0ce2d39,"In July, the Fed chair sparked controversy by suggesting the central bank couldn't address high rates of African-American unemployment.",2015-09-18,Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday defended the importance of a monetary policy that keeps income inequality low. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55fc66591c00004800082830.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, raised more than a few eyebrows in July when she suggested the Fed can do little to reduce the unemployment rate among African-Americans, which at the time was nearly twice as high as the rate for the overall population.  Testifying before the House Financial Services Committee on July 15, Yellen told Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) that black people are unemployed at higher rates than the overall population during boom times and recessions alike, which she believes indicates the disparity is a reflection of structural factors beyond the scope of Fed's monetary policy. While Yellen’s point had merit, it rankled liberal economists and activists who noted that precisely because African-American unemployment is perennially higher, black people benefit disproportionately from even modest improvements in the job market. As a result, Fed policies that promote job growth -- namely low interest rates -- can significantly improve the living standards of people of color.  Had the Berkeley economist, whose chairmanship liberals fought for against the wishes of President Barack Obama, simply articulated her argument poorly? Or had Yellen, as Fed chair, grown out of touch with how Fed interest rates affect ordinary people?On Thursday, Yellen settled doubts that the latter was true. She confirmed her staunch commitment to the Fed’s full employment mandate and appreciation of how minor job market changes disproportionately affect marginalized communities.At a press conference following the Fed’s announcement that it would leave the benchmark interest unchanged, Yellen was asked about claims that prolonged low interest rates are widening the income gap by inflating the value of financial assets. It is incidentally a favorite critique of prominent Republicans like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.Yellen responded with a full-throated defense of how an “accommodative” monetary policy -- or one that keeps interest rates low -- actually reduces income inequality by maximizing job opportunities for the most vulnerable.“To me the main thing that an accommodative monetary policy does is put people back to work,” Yellen said. “And since income inequality is surely exacerbated by having high unemployment and a weak job market -- and that has the most profound negative effects on the most vulnerable individuals -- to me, putting people back to work and seeing a strengthening of the labor market, that has a disproportionately favorable effect on vulnerable portions of our population. That is not something that increases income inequality.”Although Yellen did not mention African-Americans explicitly in her answer, Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal think tank Center on Budget & Policy Priorities, said her comments were a more effective expression of the views she has held all along. “I think she put it more thoughtfully yesterday and she was considering some of the dynamics that really affect employment for African-American workers that did not come out” in her July testimony, he said.That was not the only thing for progressives to like in what Yellen had to say. Asked whether protests opposing an interest rate hike out of concerns for the job market -- such as that of the liberal-leaning Fed Up campaign -- had affected the Fed’s decision, Yellen said the Fed welcomed input from all groups but ultimately came to its own conclusions.But then, unprompted, the Fed chair expressed her agreement with one of the Fed Up campaign’s core contentions: that the economy is far from full employment. Yellen said “the standard unemployment rate understates the degree of slack,” or room for growth, in the job market, since it fails to account for still-high rates of people who are involuntarily working part-time or have given up looking for work altogether. Those are weaknesses in the job market that many economists -- from Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz to former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers -- believe are responsible for sluggish wage growth. Despite an official unemployment rate of 5.1 percent, wages have risen 2.2 percent before inflation in the past 12 months.Jordan Haedtler, deputy director of the Fed Up campaign, saw evidence of the group’s influence in Yellen’s remarks.“It is clearly a sign that she is aware of our presence that she pivoted from a question about us to remarks about how topline unemployment figures hide the reality of people who have stopped looking for a job altogether and involuntary part-time work,” he said.“What has been extremely positive in this cycle is that the Fed is finally hearing from a diverse group of stakeholders and that is a real plus,” Bernstein said. Before the efforts of Fed Up and its allies in the past year, the Fed had “heard very little from those whose key agenda item was achievement of full employment. In many ways it is a fortunate intersection of this moment in history: the presence of a broader group of stakeholders and a Fed chair who is very sensitive to full employment policy.”Also on HuffPost:"

Two days later, he was told of the possibility of lymphoma -- a diagnosis that turned out to be correct.

It cites job creation, a lower unemployment rate, new health insurance policies for nearly nine million Americans and the end of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.""To finish the job, America needs a leader who is respected both home and abroad, and who understands the real challenges facing American families. In our opinion, the next president must be Joe Biden. If he announces he’s running, we’re all in. It’s a campaign we know he will win,"" the letter says.The signees are largely party financiers who have yet to throw their support behind Hillary Clinton, the presumptive front-runner for the Democratic nomination to the November 2016 election. Their call is the most provocative yet for Biden to take her on. The letter makes no mention of Clinton.John Maa, a member of the Democratic National Committee’s national finance committee, was one signee. Maa said he was contacted this week by another finance committee member to see if he would support Biden financially.Maa replied he would be happy to raise funds for Biden but that donors were becoming impatient as the vice president deliberates. “Time is precious,” Maa said.“I know many people who will gladly contribute, and I will absolutely try to organize,” he said.Besides Maa, the letter is signed by nearly 50 donors, Democratic activists and friends of Biden.The letter's significance goes beyond a simple declaration of support. It appears aimed at pressuring Biden to decide soon. ""We are ready if he’s ready,"" they write.Biden has sent conflicting signals about his intentions. His public and emotional accounts of his despair in the wake of his eldest son Beau’s death this year have made him sound hesitant about joining the race.At the same time, he has met with Democratic luminaries such as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and key party donors. He has also embarked on a travel schedule as vice president that this week takes him to California, Michigan and Ohio, states that could be decisive in the election.A similar effort by liberal Democrats to encourage Warren to take on Clinton for the party's nomination failed earlier this year. After coming under increasing pressure to run, Warren said she would not seek the presidency in 2016.TAKING HIS TIMEBiden has been huddling with advisers, trying to determine whether he can mount a credible bid in the face of Clinton’s financial and organizational advantages.That process will continue, independent of any movement to draft Biden, a source close to the vice president told Reuters.A former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, Clinton, 67, announced her candidacy in April.Her front-runner status has taken a beating over her use of a private email server while she was President Barack Obama's secretary of state. She has seen her support in polls tumble, creating a potential opening for Biden, 72, a former U.S. senator who became vice president when Obama became president in January 2009.A Draft Biden political-action committee was established independently of Biden’s team of advisers to lay the groundwork for a Biden run in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. It has hired operatives in all three states. The Democratic fundraisers initiated the letter but consulted Draft Biden in preparing their appeal.Even if that organization were to give Biden a leg up in mounting a bid, he would still face considerable obstacles in building a national organization that can compete with Clinton, whose campaign and fund-raising Super PAC have already built formidable war chests.The letter says Biden's ""expertise in foreign affairs is unmatched, and his knowledge of domestic policy is deep and broad. No one is better prepared for the Presidency than Joe Biden.""Much of the letter focuses on Biden's care for his family. ""Through this window we see ourselves; and thus so many have come to understand why he really is a different kind of leader. He is the right candidate for these times,"" it says.The letter offers some insight into how a Biden campaign might make its appeal to voters, arguing that a Biden run would provide continuity with President Barack Obama’s administration, serving as an unofficial Obama third term.In a five-day rolling Reuters/Ipsos poll ending on Sept. 15, 46 percent of respondents favored Clinton for the Democratic nomination, versus 27 percent for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden received 16 percent despite having not declared his candidacy. The poll had a credibility interval of 4.7 percent.Also on HuffPost:"

18,TECH,The Government Is Learning How To Change Your Behavior -- Supposedly For Your Own Good,Alexander Howard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/behavioral-science-government_us_55fb2a91e4b00310edf66328,Governments should be obligated to disclose how behavioral science and technology are used in public policy.,2015-09-18,Is the government right to keep you from your extra-large soda?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55fc570720000026002428ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Not every effort to change how we make choices will go flat like the soda ban that former Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration tried to impose upon the people of New York City.That effort, which ultimately fell apart after beverage companies sued the city and a court ruled that the public health department had exceeded its regulatory authority, is probably the best known example of a government trying to change how consumers make a given choice.The idea behind New York City's ban seemed simple enough: people will drink less soda if they're forced to buy a smaller portion. If they wanted another cup of soda, they could go get one -- but overall, people would drink less of it, reducing the risk of obesity or diabetes.Bloomberg's soda ban became a political football, with a national debate breaking out over whether the government should be able to tell you to get a smaller cup for your drink or not. Public health advocates supported it. Beverage companies saw a risk to their bottom lines. Critics saw it as a restriction of individual freedom, with Big Brother meeting Big Mother. But despite the controversy, a growing number of governments have been experimenting with applying behavioral science to identify the reasons that people make poor choices about health or their finances, tweaking the way options are presented in randomized trials to assess the results. This week, President Barack Obama issued an executive order to make behavioral science part of more U.S. government policies and programs, following the promising early results of various experiments by the White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team:By improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Government, behavioral science insights can support a range of national priorities, including helping workers to find better jobs; enabling Americans to lead longer, healthier lives; improving access to educational opportunities and support for success in school; and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy."" -- President Barack Obama In the NPR interview embedded below, Maya Shankar, the team's chairwoman, told host Robert Siegel about their first annual report's findings. In past years, conservatives have decried the Obama administration's use of behavioral science as liberal paternalism, or the 21st century version of the nanny state. But research by law professor Cass Sunstein, the former head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, suggests people don't oppose the use of behavioral science in public policy; only the outcomes of their political opponents using it. How governments communicate and present choices to the public can be now be tested and improved on an unprecedented scale, and in various forms and contexts.By deciding to make opting in for organ donation the default choice at the Department of Motor Vehicles, for example, or by automatically enrolling people in retirement savings plans, it's possible to achieve improved social outcomes without huge expense. Similarly, it can be beneficial to ""nudge"" people about important deadlines or tasks -- say, when school administrators send text messages to accepted college students as a reminder that they should actually go ahead and enroll in school. Nudges might take the form of a letter, email, text message or other prompt, like the one below.Agencies can now test different versions of the language used in forms using randomized trials and analyze which ones work better, thus improving websites and digital services.We should want them to do so, frankly: no one wants to spend extra time filling out forms and applications on a government website, or, more seriously, not to understand crucial questions or details. Results can improve even more when this approach is coupled with new technologies in non-governmental contexts, like a ""smart toothbrush"" connected to an app, and incentives, like lower dental insurance premiums for better hygiene. The U.S. government is far from alone in experimenting with applying behavioral insights to making public policy. As The Guardian reports, there now are ""nudge units"" in Australia, Singapore and Germany, in addition to the British ""Behavioural Insights Team.""That group, founded in 2010, has quadrupled in size and has been spun out of the British government as a private ""social purpose"" company, taking on projects around the world. In April 2015, the BIT entered into a three-year partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies on its new What Works Cities initiative. As consumers share more of their personal data for apps and services that help them make choices about their health, energy use, education or finances, they will also need crystal-clear disclosures about how the government chooses to present these choices, beyond notices in the Federal Register. Baking the evidence gathered from behavioral science into public policy is not without controversy or risk, and concerns about the ""nanny state"" or privacy abound.As presidents and prime ministers decide to move forward with this approach, it's crucial that they effectively disclose their rationales for the decisions behind the decisions to lawmakers and the public, so that the consent of the governed is not an afterthought.

The latest photo series in the project focuses on a particular group of parents: moms of children with special needs. Titled ""Defined by Our Hearts,"" the new series shows six mothers posing with their children and sharing their stories and thoughts on parenting kids with disabilities.The photographer told The Huffington Post that she also hopes ""Defined by Our Hearts"" resonates with other moms of kids with special needs and inspires all parents -- regardless of their child's level of ability. ""I hope that it helps mothers whose children are typically developing to start conversations with their children on how amazing these kids are and to be more understanding,"" she said.""Don't hush your child when they have questions about another child's special needs,"" the photographer continued, adding that her 3-year-old son attends a special needs school for sensory issues and speech delays. ""I've had so many children ask me, or my son, why he sounds like a baby,"" she said. ""I hope by me modeling a healthy response and reaction to these questions, it will give him the confidence to not be embarrassed as he grows. I never want him to feel that he is less than others just because he has a hard time with his speech.""As with her previous photo series, McCain photographed the moms having open and honest conversations in their underwear -- to empower them, ""help normalize the natural body"" and ""paint a better picture of motherhood,"" she said.""While the mothers may be speaking about their children, the series still focuses on the mothers' lives, feelings, bodies, and general motherhood,"" she added. ""When you feel more confident and have a healthy body image, this positively affects all areas of your life.""The series title, ""Defined by Our Hearts"" comes from one of the moms' quotes about her son, which stuck with McCain.

Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) said they would be open to putting civil rights activist Rosa Parks on the $10 bill. But the Republican candidates might be surprised to learn that Parks sat on the national board of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, one of the GOP’s biggest political enemies.Cruz, ironically, is leading the Republican attack on Planned Parenthood, trying to pressure his colleagues in the Senate to threaten a government shutdown to end federal funding for the family planning provider. But the Texas conservative praised Parks in the debate Wednesday night, calling her “a principled pioneer that helped change this country, helped remedy racial injustice.” He said putting her on the $10 bill is “an honor that would be entirely appropriate,” though he’d prefer to have her picture on the $20 in lieu of Andrew Jackson's.Parks’ role on Planned Parenthood’s national board is not the only bit of her history that might make Republicans uncomfortable. She was also influenced by the Communist movement, which laid the groundwork for the civil rights movement in Alabama. In her younger years, she attended Communist Party meetings with her husband, though she never joined. But the GOP candidates seem to love her. Rubio called her ""an everyday American that changed the course of history"" and Trump said Parks would be the best choice for the currency -- after, of course, his own daughter. “Other than that, we’ll go with Rosa Parks,” the billionaire decided. “I like that.”Also on HuffPost:"

Yellen also cautioned against brinksmanship over raising the debt ceiling. “I believe it is the responsibility of Congress to pass a budget, to fund the government, to deal with the debt ceiling so that America pays its bills,” Yellen said at a press conference on the Fed’s decision to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged. “We have a good recovery in place that is really making progress. To see Congress take actions that would endanger that progress -- I think that would be quite unfortunate.” Yellen insisted that fear of a government shutdown and the harm it would cause the economy had not influenced the Fed’s decision to maintain near-zero interest rates. “It played absolutely no role in our decision,” Yellen said. House Republicans are refusing to pass legislation to fund the government, if it provides money to Planned Parenthood. President Barack Obama has vowed to veto any measure that doesn't include funding for the reproductive health care provider, setting up a confrontation that could shutter the federal government if a resolution is not reached before Sept. 30.Standard & Poor’s estimated that the last GOP-led government shutdown in October 2013 cost the economy $24 billion in lost GDP. That shutdown, which lasted 16 days, was precipitated by House Republicans’ refusal to provide funding for the Affordable Care Act."

While the RNC rolled out its schedule in January, the DNC announced its plan just last month, with the first debate set for Oct. 13 in Nevada. Only four debates will occur before voting begins in Iowa next year.Politico reported Wednesday on the rift between Democrats over the schedule amid perceptions that Clinton is being protected by party leaders.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and his campaign have been the most vocal critics of the DNC plan. Campaign manager Dave Hamrick told Politico that “every Democratic campaign and the DNC should have to explain why we are ceding the discussion and attention to the Republicans by refusing to the kind of robust debate schedule we've always had.”Wasserman Schultz defended the DNC’s schedule Wednesday night in the post-debate spin room at the Reagan Library. The process allows candidates “the opportunity to balance the time they need to spend in the early primary states, in particular, doing the retail politics that is so important for them to be able to have those voters kick the tires,” she said. One critique of the Republican process has been that candidates who rank lower in the polls would feel compelled to be spend more time in TV studios, rather than meeting voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. That's because GOP candidates vying for a primetime spot on the Fox News or CNN stage needed to boost national poll numbers -- a feat that might be more easily accomplished by appearing on cable news or late-night talk shows, as opposed to campaign stops at coffee shops. Though many Americans likely tuned in to the Republican debates to see what Donald Trump might say next, the much-anticipated events have also provided significant exposure for the party's many candidates, allowing some strong debaters -- like former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina -- to increase their standing nationally. The second Republican debate, which has been the biggest story in politics in recent weeks and received saturation coverage on CNN, is expected to be the highest-rated event in that network's history, following a record-setting night last month on Fox News. “We will have, in a month, an opportunity in a debate,” Wasserman Schultz said. “But we already have an ongoing opportunity with our candidates to draw the very clear and serious contrasts for voters across America.”"

He will stop at New York’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral and celebrate Mass at Philadelphia’s Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.Here’s a look at some of the history of the Washington and Philadelphia sites:Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, Washington, D.C.The dome, decorated with polychrome tiles, and the 329-foot tower of this imposing building can be spotted from across the nation’s capital. It is the largest Catholic church in North America and one of the 10 largest in the world.In 1910, Bishop Thomas Shahan launched a campaign for the building of the shrine to honor the Virgin Mary. Pope Francis will visit the site on the 95th anniversary of the laying of its cornerstone, in 1920.The edifice includes the Crypt Church on the lower level, completed in 1926, and the Great Upper Church, which was dedicated in 1959 after delays during the Depression and World War II.The shrine has the world’s largest collection of contemporary ecclesiastical art, with 81 altars and devotional spaces paying tribute to Mary by cultures across the globe.“Our interior reflects the demographics of the United States,” said basilica archivist and curator Geraldine M. Rohling. Cultures represented range from the Czech, Slovak and Polish chapels that were donated and dedicated in the 1960s to the Our Mother of Africa Chapel constructed in the 1990s.In 1968, the shrine acquired the tiara of Pope Paul VI, the last pope to wear the traditional papal crown. He famously removed it in 1963; proceeds were given to the poor, and donations continue to be given to a papal fund for the poor.The shrine is not a parish church, but it offers daily and weekend Masses. It has had just one wedding — of the younger daughter of President Lyndon B. Johnson, Luci Baines Johnson.The Great Upper Church is used for special large gatherings, including the annual prayer vigil the day before the March for Life in Washington, D.C., each January, and special occasions, such as prayers on 9/11.“It was very chilling because if you stood on our front steps or you walked in the front steps, you could see the Pentagon burning in the distance,” said Rohling of that day in 2001.An estimated 1 million people spend time at the site each year, attending Mass, going to confession or visiting as pilgrims or tourists.Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, Washington, D.C.This parish was originally dedicated in 1840 at 15th and H streets, NW, but later moved to its current location on Rhode Island Avenue, less than a mile away. Architect Christopher Grant La Farge, who also worked on the plans of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, designed the Italian Renaissance structure. The first Mass there was celebrated in 1895, but its exterior construction continued through 1913, when its cross-topped copper dome was put in place.In 1939, it was named a cathedral and became the mother church of the Washington archdiocese after Pope Pius XII separated it from the Baltimore archdiocese.It is best known as the site of the funeral of President John F. Kennedy — where his young son and namesake memorably saluted his casket. But the brick and sandstone edifice also was where the funeral service was held for Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist.On the first Monday in October, the downtown cathedral hosts the annual Red Mass, which is often attended by Supreme Court justices, and features prayers for legal professionals. The clergy who celebrate the Mass traditionally wear red.Some 2,500 people, including many single young adults, worship there each weekend.St. Patrick’s Cathedral, New YorkThe soaring white marble edifice, located on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, opened in 1879.It was financed by rich and poor alike — from $1,000 donations by wealthy Catholics to the token gifts of poor immigrants.Named for Ireland’s patron saint, it is the second New York cathedral, built after what is now known as the Basilica of St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral, which was dedicated in 1815 and is about three miles away.With its cornerstone laid in 1858, the newer cathedral was the vision of Archbishop John Hughes and was designed by architect James Renwick. Some criticized it as “Hughes’ folly,” but the cathedral ended up as he envisioned, in what has become “the heart of the city,” near Rockefeller Center, the Museum of Modern Art and the high-end designer shops of Fifth Avenue.Fundraising delays and the start of the Civil War halted construction from 1861-1866. By the time it was dedicated, the Gothic Revival building was the “working seat of America’s largest diocese and the grandest church in the Western Hemisphere,” wrote Charles Morris, author of “American Catholic.”Artisan Charles Connick contributed the design of stained glass windows that were installed in the 1950s.On Sept. 16, 2001, the cathedral was the site of a memorial Mass for the victims of 9/11.More than 5 million people visit the cathedral each year; Masses are offered seven times each weekday and 11 times on holy days.Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, PhiladelphiaThe brownstone cathedral, completed in 1864 in the Roman-Corinthian architectural style, was modeled after the Lombard Church of St. Charles in Rome.Unlike many other churches, for almost a century the basilica did not have stained glass windows in its lower level.“It was a time of anti-Catholic sentiment in the city of Philadelphia,” said the Rev. Dennis Gill, rector of the cathedral. “Because the anti-Catholic sentiment was often expressed by people breaking windows of Catholic churches and burning them down, in order to avoid that happening to the cathedral the windows were put at such a height so that they would be less easily broken.”Later, in the 1950s, stained glass was added to the lower section of the cathedral.It has ties to several U.S. saints, including John Neumann, the bishop under whose tenure much of the edifice was constructed and who established the first parochial school system in the U.S., and Katharine Drexel, a philanthropist and educator who founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, who worshipped at the cathedral.The cathedral also was the host of the International Eucharistic Congress, held in 1976 as the United States celebrated its bicentennial.“The theme was that the Eucharist satisfies the hungers of the human heart,” said Gill. “It was an occasion for the church to highlight what it holds most valuable.”The cathedral, located in Philadelphia’s center city, continues to function as a parish, with about 1,500 worshippers attending each weekend.Also on HuffPost:"

He will stop at New York’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral and celebrate Mass at Philadelphia’s Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.Here’s a look at some of the history of the Washington and Philadelphia sites:Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, Washington, D.C.The dome, decorated with polychrome tiles, and the 329-foot tower of this imposing building can be spotted from across the nation’s capital. It is the largest Catholic church in North America and one of the 10 largest in the world.In 1910, Bishop Thomas Shahan launched a campaign for the building of the shrine to honor the Virgin Mary. Pope Francis will visit the site on the 95th anniversary of the laying of its cornerstone, in 1920.The edifice includes the Crypt Church on the lower level, completed in 1926, and the Great Upper Church, which was dedicated in 1959 after delays during the Depression and World War II.The shrine has the world’s largest collection of contemporary ecclesiastical art, with 81 altars and devotional spaces paying tribute to Mary by cultures across the globe.“Our interior reflects the demographics of the United States,” said basilica archivist and curator Geraldine M. Rohling. Cultures represented range from the Czech, Slovak and Polish chapels that were donated and dedicated in the 1960s to the Our Mother of Africa Chapel constructed in the 1990s.In 1968, the shrine acquired the tiara of Pope Paul VI, the last pope to wear the traditional papal crown. He famously removed it in 1963; proceeds were given to the poor, and donations continue to be given to a papal fund for the poor.The shrine is not a parish church, but it offers daily and weekend Masses. It has had just one wedding — of the younger daughter of President Lyndon B. Johnson, Luci Baines Johnson.The Great Upper Church is used for special large gatherings, including the annual prayer vigil the day before the March for Life in Washington, D.C., each January, and special occasions, such as prayers on 9/11.“It was very chilling because if you stood on our front steps or you walked in the front steps, you could see the Pentagon burning in the distance,” said Rohling of that day in 2001.An estimated 1 million people spend time at the site each year, attending Mass, going to confession or visiting as pilgrims or tourists.Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, Washington, D.C.This parish was originally dedicated in 1840 at 15th and H streets, NW, but later moved to its current location on Rhode Island Avenue, less than a mile away. Architect Christopher Grant La Farge, who also worked on the plans of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, designed the Italian Renaissance structure. The first Mass there was celebrated in 1895, but its exterior construction continued through 1913, when its cross-topped copper dome was put in place.In 1939, it was named a cathedral and became the mother church of the Washington archdiocese after Pope Pius XII separated it from the Baltimore archdiocese.It is best known as the site of the funeral of President John F. Kennedy — where his young son and namesake memorably saluted his casket. But the brick and sandstone edifice also was where the funeral service was held for Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist.On the first Monday in October, the downtown cathedral hosts the annual Red Mass, which is often attended by Supreme Court justices, and features prayers for legal professionals. The clergy who celebrate the Mass traditionally wear red.Some 2,500 people, including many single young adults, worship there each weekend.St. Patrick’s Cathedral, New YorkThe soaring white marble edifice, located on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, opened in 1879.It was financed by rich and poor alike — from $1,000 donations by wealthy Catholics to the token gifts of poor immigrants.Named for Ireland’s patron saint, it is the second New York cathedral, built after what is now known as the Basilica of St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral, which was dedicated in 1815 and is about three miles away.With its cornerstone laid in 1858, the newer cathedral was the vision of Archbishop John Hughes and was designed by architect James Renwick. Some criticized it as “Hughes’ folly,” but the cathedral ended up as he envisioned, in what has become “the heart of the city,” near Rockefeller Center, the Museum of Modern Art and the high-end designer shops of Fifth Avenue.Fundraising delays and the start of the Civil War halted construction from 1861-1866. By the time it was dedicated, the Gothic Revival building was the “working seat of America’s largest diocese and the grandest church in the Western Hemisphere,” wrote Charles Morris, author of “American Catholic.”Artisan Charles Connick contributed the design of stained glass windows that were installed in the 1950s.On Sept. 16, 2001, the cathedral was the site of a memorial Mass for the victims of 9/11.More than 5 million people visit the cathedral each year; Masses are offered seven times each weekday and 11 times on holy days.Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, PhiladelphiaThe brownstone cathedral, completed in 1864 in the Roman-Corinthian architectural style, was modeled after the Lombard Church of St. Charles in Rome.Unlike many other churches, for almost a century the basilica did not have stained glass windows in its lower level.“It was a time of anti-Catholic sentiment in the city of Philadelphia,” said the Rev. Dennis Gill, rector of the cathedral. “Because the anti-Catholic sentiment was often expressed by people breaking windows of Catholic churches and burning them down, in order to avoid that happening to the cathedral the windows were put at such a height so that they would be less easily broken.”Later, in the 1950s, stained glass was added to the lower section of the cathedral.It has ties to several U.S. saints, including John Neumann, the bishop under whose tenure much of the edifice was constructed and who established the first parochial school system in the U.S., and Katharine Drexel, a philanthropist and educator who founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, who worshipped at the cathedral.The cathedral also was the host of the International Eucharistic Congress, held in 1976 as the United States celebrated its bicentennial.“The theme was that the Eucharist satisfies the hungers of the human heart,” said Gill. “It was an occasion for the church to highlight what it holds most valuable.”The cathedral, located in Philadelphia’s center city, continues to function as a parish, with about 1,500 worshippers attending each weekend.Also on HuffPost:"
