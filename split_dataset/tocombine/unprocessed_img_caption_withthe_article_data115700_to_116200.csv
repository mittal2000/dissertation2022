They read: ""Those who fail to comply with the instructions to leave immediately will endanger their lives and the lives of their families. Beware.""The Israeli military told the residents of three of Beit Lahiya's 10 neighborhoods to get out of the town of 70,000 by midday on Sunday. U.N. officials said some 10,000 people had fled south to eight schools run by the world body in Gaza City.A senior military officer, in a telephone briefing with foreign reporters, said Israel would ""strike with might"" in the Beit Lahiya area from the late evening hours on Sunday.He did not say if this would include an expansion of an air and naval offensive into a ground operation in the north of the narrow, densely populated Mediterranean enclave.""The enemy has built rocket infrastructure in-between the houses (in Beit Lahiya),"" the Israeli officer said. ""He wants to trap me into an attack and into hurting civilians.""The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 160 Palestinians - among them about 135 civilians, including 30 children - have died during six days of warfare, and more than 1,000 hurt.At schools run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in Gaza City, Beit Lahiya residents arrived in donkey carts filled with children, luggage and mattresses, while others came by car or taxi. One man, still in pajamas, said some inhabitants had received phone calls telling them to leave.""What could we do? We had to run in order to save the lives of our children,"" said Salem Abu Halima, 25, a father of two.Gaza's Interior Ministry, in a statement on Hamas radio, dismissed Israel's warnings as ""psychological warfare"". It told those who left their homes to return and others to stay put. CIVILIAN TOLLDozens of houses in Beit Lahiya were leveled by Israeli bulldozers during the month-long Gaza war of 2008-2009. Israel says such structures serve as gun nests and rocket launch pads.The leaflets marked the first time Israel had warned Palestinians to vacate dwellings in such a wide area. Previous warnings, by phone or so-called ""knock-on-the-door"" missiles without explosive warheads, had been directed at individual homes slated for attack.A Palestinian woman and a girl aged three were killed in Israeli air strikes early on Sunday, the Health Ministry said.Hostilities along the Israel-Gaza frontier first intensified last month after Israeli forces arrested hundreds of Hamas activists in the Israeli-occupied West Bank following the abduction there of three Jewish seminary students who were later found killed. A Palestinian youth was then killed in Jerusalem in a suspected revenge attack by Israelis.Despite intensified Israeli military action - which included a commando raid overnight - Palestinians continued to launch rockets across the border.A long-range burst on Sunday triggered air raid sirens and sent people running for shelter at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion Airport, which has not been struck in the hostilities and where flights have been operating normally, and some city suburbs.No one has been killed by the more than 800 rockets Israel says have been fired since the offensive began. Lacking guidance systems, many of the rockets have fallen wide. Others have been shot down by Israel's Iron Dome interceptors.""We will continue to act with patience, forbearance, with determination, responsibility and aggression to achieve the goal of the campaign - restoring calm for a long period by dealing a significant blow to Hamas and other terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in broadcast after his cabinet met.International pressure on both sides for a return to calm has increased, with the U.N. Security Council calling for a cessation of hostilities and Western foreign ministers meeting on Sunday to weigh strategy.French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius spoke of ""a dangerous escalation"" and told reporters before talks in Vienna with his U.S., German and British counterparts that securing a ceasefire was ""an absolute priority"".German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier will travel to the Middle East on Monday and Tuesday for meetings with Netanyahu and U.S.-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who agreed a power-share deal with his Hamas rivals in April.Germany mediated a prisoner swap in 2011 in which an Israeli soldier held by Hamas was freed in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel. U.S. WANTS 2012 TRUCE RESTOREDU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, whose bid to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace fell apart when Netanyahu called off negotiations over the Abbas-Hamas pact, reasserted Washington's support for Israel's right to self-defense on Sunday.But a senior State Department official said that Kerry, speaking to Netanyahu by phone, also ""highlighted the U.S. concern about escalating tensions ... (and) readiness to facilitate a cessation of hostilities, including a return to the November 2012 ceasefire agreement"".That referred to an Egyptian-mediated truce that ended the last major Gaza flare-up. Cairo is now again seeking calm and Israeli media said Turkey and Qatar have also offered to intercede with Hamas, which is formally shunned by Israel, the United States and European Union as a terrorist group.Israel has been publicly cool to truce proposals, saying its current assault on Hamas is the best guarantee of long-term quiet. Israel says an invasion of Gaza remains an option and has mobilized more than 30,000 reservists, but most attacks have so far been from the air, hitting some 1,200 targets.A survey by Israel's Channel 10 TV found that 90 percent of the country's Jewish majority supported the air offensive. Asked if Israel should send in ground forces, 47 percent of said yes, 32 percent said no, and 21 percent were undecided.Giving details of Sunday's naval commando raid, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said four members of the force were wounded in skirmishes with Gaza gunmen but the rocket launching site they attacked was hit.Hamas said its fighters had fired at the Israeli force offshore, preventing them from landing. Lerner said the forces had ""completed their mission"".Hundreds of mourners attended the funerals on Sunday of the 17 Palestinians killed in Israel's bombing, on Saturday night, of the home of Gaza police chief Taysee Al-Batsh.""With our souls and blood we will redeem the martyrs!"" the crowd chanted as armed men fired in the air.A Hamas source said Batsh was in critical condition and that all the dead were members of his family. The Gaza Health Ministry said 45 people were also wounded in the bombing.The Israeli military said it had appointed a general to investigate the high civilian toll in several Gaza strikes.An Israeli teenager was wounded on Sunday by a rocket that struck the southern town of Ashkelon, emergency services said.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cf88200000070201d0bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Ask Republicans on Capitol Hill or Sunday show pundits and they'll tell you the same thing: Our southern border isn't secure -- just look at the crisis overwhelming authorities today. Texas Governor Rick Perry is demanding the National Guard be brought in to beef it up, while former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is convinced that there effectively is no border. ""Without borders, there is no nation. Obama knows this. Opening our borders to a flood of illegal immigrants is deliberate,"" she warned in the pages of Breitbart, echoing a common consensus among opponents of immigration reform. But ask people who live along the border, and you'll get quite a different answer. Or ask Jose Antonio Vargas.The Pulitzer Prize-winning, undocumented journalist traveled to McAllen, Texas this week, fresh off the release of his documentary Documented to give a voice to thousands of children who have been detained at the border, but he didn't expect to find himself trapped there as well. He didn't realize how secure the border is. “They're everywhere. Actually, as I'm talking to you, there's a border control van parked at the hotel I'm staying at,"" Vargas told The Huffington Post in an interview on Saturday.Vargas flew to the small border town on Thursday and joined other immigration activists to interview and film undocumented minors fleeing escalating violence in their home countries in Central America. The temporary facilities where they are being held are ill-equipped and over capacity, which has prompted the Obama administration to request billions in additional funds from Congress to address what members of both parties have called a ""humanitarian crisis.""But what Vargas didn't know is that in order to be able to leave the border town he would need to pass through an interior U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint set up within 45 miles of McAllen. That would require presenting proper documentation he doesn't own.""When my friend Mony Ruiz-Velasco, an immigration lawyer who used to work in the area, saw on my Facebook page that I was in McAllen, she texted me: 'I am so glad you are visiting the kids near the border. But how will you get through the checkpoint on your way back?' A curious question, I thought, and one I dismissed. I’ve visited the border before, in California. What checkpoint? What was she talking about?"" he wrote in Politico Magazine on Friday.Such checkpoints are located throughout the Southwestern U.S. border, comprising of a 100-mile wide, Bill-of-Rights-free strip where authorities have claimed the privilege to do things they would not be permitted to do anywhere else in the country, such as executing a “routine search"" without a warrant or probable cause, or asking American citizens for papers.Vargas could fly out of the local airport as he has done in the past by using his Philippines-issued passport. But he has learned that the border patrol is active in the airport, placing him in a precarious situation and he worries that, even though his visibility as an immigration reform activists has shielded him in the past, he may not be so lucky this time.“I’m going to fly out of here, I haven’t decided exactly when, but it’s going to be a test since the border patrol is at the airport,"" he told HuffPost. Though Vargas was brought to the U.S. as a young child, he is not eligible for the federal deferred action that addresses people in his situation, because he is over the age of 30, he said.Vargas' story highlights some of the struggles undocumented immigrants have faced for years. But it also shows, contrary to conventional wisdom, that security at the border is anything but lax. In fact, according to the NDN/New Policy Institute, since 2002 federal funds to secure the border have tripled and the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents has doubled to a little over 21,000. Moreover, crime along the U.S. side of the border is down, and the growth of the undocumented immigrant population has stalled in recent years. ""Obama era policies have stopped the flow – which is one reason why we have the resources to be apprehending those attempting to enter the country today,"" said NDN President Simon Rosenberg.As Vargas put it, “The border is secure, that’s why these kids are getting apprehended.”To Luis Malbonado, a DREAMer who lives near McAllen, a heightened security presence resembling an occupied military zone is all too familiar. Both his mother and sister were deported mere hours after being stopped by authorities in the city, a task made easier by their proximity to the border, he said.""It’s been three years since I haven't seen my mom, five years since I haven’t seen my sister. Right now there’s no way I can go and see them. I’m stuck,"" he told The Huffington Post.Malbonado said residents of the Rio Grande Valley usually encounter checkpoints every few miles, and it was common to see border patrol and state trooper cars while driving on the highway. ""It is so safe and secure that both my mom and my sister were deported [from] within the city,"" he added.Malbonado also called on President Obama to visit the border, a trip that Republicans and even some Democrats have been calling for.""He needs to come and see first hand and see what these kids look like,"" he said. ""They do not have tattoos on their face. They do not look like the media is portraying them. These are kids. ""As for Vargas, the future is murky. He doesn't intend to leave the border until he finishes his job, so he is, at least for the moment, as much a resident of McAllen as the immigrant children he came to report on.Cristina Jiménez, managing director of the immigration advocacy group United We Dream, was less than certain that Vargas would ultimately be able to leave McAllen. ""It’s going to be really difficult. None of the young people there have been able to leave. Border patrol is right next to TSA,"" she said. ""Either way, if it's plane or driving Jose is going to have to confront the reality of being undocumented.""Ryan Grim contributed reporting. Vargas previously reported for The Huffington Post."

Fresh off the Knicks' dismal 2013-2014 season, Melo entertained their offers before opting to return to New York. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed by the team but Chris Broussard of ESPN reported it would be for five years and worth more than $122 million, citing an unnamed source. ""After three months of questions around Carmelo Anthony's return to the New York Knicks, we are now happy to know that we have the cornerstone of what we envision as a 'team of excellence.'"" Knicks president Phil Jackson said in a press release issued by the team on Sunday. ""Steve Mills and I have assured Carmelo through our conversations, that we share the vision and the determination to build this team.”Anthony joined the Knicks via trade in February 2011 and helped the team to three playoff appearances. The team reached fail to escape the first round of the playoffs in 2011 and 2012 but advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals in 2013 after winning 54 games during the regular season. Anthony averaged 28.7 points per game during the 2013-2013 season to win his first career scoring title. With the Knicks struggling through a 37-45 and missed the playoffs, Jackson took over the Knicks' front office in March. "

Many climbed up to the Christ statue, draping blue-and-white colors at the bottom.Brazilian fans have largely thrown their lot in with Germany, hoping they can stop an Argentine win that would give them bragging rights for years.

THIRD GERMANY V ARGENTINA FINALIt is the third World Cup final between Germany and Argentina. Argentina won 3-2 in a 1986 thriller in Mexico City, while Germany won 1-0 four years later in Rome in an awful game.And the history does not stop there: Germany have kicked Argentina out of the last two World Cups in the quarter-finals, humiliatingly so by a 4-0 scoreline in 2010 when they cruelly exposed then coach Maradona's tactical naivety.After an exciting tournament where attack has prevailed and goals have been flowing, the final is likely to be a more cagey affair with Germany employing numbers to annul Messi and Argentina wary of leaving the sorts of spaces that Brazil did.Both goalkeepers, Manuel Neuer of Germany and Sergio Romero of Argentina, are in the form of their lives, while Messi, on four goals, and Thomas Mueller, on five, are both chasing the ""Golden Boot"" award for the leading scorer.Colombia's James Rodriguez is ahead at the moment on six goals. All three are also among the 10 players short-listed for FIFA's ""Golden Ball"" award to the tournament's best player.The prizes are to be announced after Sunday's final.A goal-laden tournament has already produce 170 goals and could beat the all-time record of 171 set in France in 1998.Brazil's agony at losing the semi-final so disastrously was compounded by another poor defensive display in Saturday's 3-0 defeat by the Netherlands in the third-place playoff match.Having not lost a competitive home game since 1975, Brazil have now suffered two defeats in five days: a sad end to a tournament they entered with such confidence and high hopes.An Argentina win on Sunday would complete their misery.

Among the reasons I can think of that speak to why there isn't block-to-block coverage of other potential Democratic contenders (besides maybe Elizabeth Warren, more on that later) are: 1) it's 2014 at the moment, and maybe people are showing a modicum of restraint, and 2) Hillary Clinton is currently ""freezing the field."" Which is a way of saying that she looms so large over the landscape as a potential frontrunner for the nomination, despite not actually campaigning, that it's inhibiting other candidates from doing the sorts of things they need to do to carve out a place in the firmament (hire top strategists, set up donor networks, etc.). And yes, if she waits a long time and decides to not run, that could touch off a last-minute dash for the resources she won't be using.But beyond that, if you want to know why we're not talking about other potential Democratic candidates, it's simply because -- well ... I mean, have you seen who those people are? I've been diligently tracking the 2016 chatter for some time, and I can tell you that most of the people who are the beneficiaries of speculation are either far more interesting because of the things they are doing that are not related to running for president, or they aren't that interesting in any event. There are, of course, exceptions. Here's a ridiculously good profile of former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer by the inimitable Marin Cogan, if you want. But by and large, I can look at who's out there and just sort of understand why there's not a lot of stylish profiles being written about these people.I think you'll see what I mean after you check out ""The Brutalist Guide To 2016's Democratic Contenders (Not Named Hillary Clinton)."" (Coming soon: ""The Brutalist Guide To 2016's Democratic Contenders (Who Will Also Not Be Named Hillary Clinton)"" as well.)THE NOT-HILLARYSJoe Biden Who is this person? Former Delaware senator, current vice president. To his supporters, he is America's Fun Uncle. To his detractors, he is a walking gaffe machine. Political reporters typically side with the detractors. (To political reporters, Biden giving support to marriage equality on ""Meet The Press"" was a ""gaffe"") Why do people think this person is going to run for president? Because that's what the veep gig is supposed to provide: A path to the presidency. Also, Biden is said to be ""laying the groundwork."" His team is said to be ""confident."" What's the problem? The thing about being known as either a gaffe-machine or a fun uncle, is that the consistent idea that underlies these sentiments is a struggle to be taken seriously. Is that fair? No, but if you recall, everyone loved ""maverick"" back-slappy John McCain until they had to start seriously contemplating him as president. And when the headline of a post that asks readers to seriously consider a Biden campaign contains the words ""not so crazy,"" you see the obstacle. Key quote: But it's not insurmountable. Here's Jeanne Marie Laskas: ""Washington had been hyperventilating about the fiscal cliff, and Obama sent Biden in to broker a deal. Then came the killings in Newtown, Connecticut, and Obama sent Biden out to rally the public, Biden in to reason with Congress, Biden over to talk to the NRA. In 2013, Biden has emerged increasingly more visibly potent than his boss.""Andrew Cuomo Who is this person? Governor Of New York, marriage equality champion. Prickly. Why do people think this person is going to run for president? He is basically #3 on everyone's ""Who Will Run Against Hillary Clinton in 2016"" list.  What's the problem? He's actually not a great fit with the Democratic base, and he's gone out of his way to scuttle the ambitions of New York Democrats. The National Review is unrestrained in its ardor for him. On the issue of public sector unions, he's kind of Scott Walkery. And if he ever goes to Iowa, the anti-fracking forces will greet him with jeers. Key quote: Well, ""When asked in a recent interview with CBS News if he was thinking about a 2016 bid, Cuomo said 'not at all.'""Martin O'Malley Who is this person? Former mayor of Baltimore, current governor of Maryland. Plays in a céilí band. Why do people think this person is going to run for president? Well, because Martin O'Malley keeps telling people that he's going to. In early August, O'Malley ""told a group of reporters Saturday he was laying the 'framework' for his 2016 presidential bid."" (""Framework"" is the same thing as ""groundwork,"" except you use frames, not ground.) What's the problem? A near total lack of charisma. Daily Kos calls his message ""timid."" The ironic thing is that political reporters find his message to be too boldly liberal, as is their wont. (That is to say, not timid enough.) Key quote: Per Jamal Simmons, ""Ultimately, there's no reason for O'Malley to sit this one out. He should run. What's the worst thing that could happen? (Famous last words!)""Bernie Sanders Who is this person? Independent U.S. senator from Vermont. Self-described socialist. Has some notable examples of partisan gridlock-breaking, however. Why do people think this person is going to run for president? He's been threatening to do so, and has taken his talents to New Hampshire. (Significant!) Back in March, he told The Nation's John Nichols, ""I am prepared to run for president of the United States. I don't believe that I am the only person out there who can fight this fight, but I am certainly prepared to look seriously at that race."" What's the problem? Well, as Nichols points out: ""In some senses, Sanders is the unlikeliest of prospects: an independent who caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate but has never joined the party, a democratic socialist in a country where many politicians fear the label 'liberal,' an outspoken critic of the economic, environmental and social status quo who rips 'the ruling class' and calls out the Koch brothers by name."" Key quote: Well, as Sanders says: ""If the question is, am I actively right now organizing and raising money and so forth for a campaign for president, I am not doing that.""Brian Schweitzer Who is this person? Former governor of Montana. Why do people think this person is going to run for president? Back when Schweitzer decided that he did not want to run for the Senate, he kept stoking the idea that he's contemplating a run by saying things like this: ""I hold the people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina in high regard. ... If I were running for U.S. Senate, I'd be so goldarn busy I wouldn't be able to get out and visit with my friends in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina."" And he also keeps talking about he'd ""make a better president than Hillary Clinton."" Say that enough times and I'm afraid you've got to try to prove it. What's the problem? He despises Washington like it was feline leukemia, saying, ""Most of the people you talk to are frauds."" As president, he would spend all of his time with those frauds. Key quote: Per Chris Cillizza: ""Schweitzer has a ton of charisma but his schtick can also wear thin over time."" You don't say!BLASTS FROM THE PASTJerry Brown Who is this person? Former and current governor of California. Depending on how old you are, you may have voted for him in a Democratic presidential primary. Why do people think this person is going to run for president? Not many do, up to and including Jerry Brown himself. But as Paul Bedard wrote: ""He's in his third term as governor of California, is a lock to win a fourth, and has won glowing media reviews for reining in the state's budget mess. So it's natural that allies of Jerry Brown are starting to talk up a possible 2016 presidential bid."" What's the problem? Paul Bedard also writes: ""Other associates, however, [say] Brown is nearly done with politics, that he ran for statewide office only to end the budget crisis."" Key quote: ""I asked an astute Californian about Brown's prospects for national office,"" wrote Bernie Quigley, who added, ""He said he will be too old in 2016. But Brown, Zen man of contemporary politics, is in a sense timeless."" This is the first time I've ever seen a politician receive an endorsement based on metaphysics.Howard Dean Who is this person? Former governor of Vermont. Enthusiasm and poor microphone technique combined to be his undoing in the 2004 presidential primaries. Went on to be the most effective chair of the Democratic National Committee in your lifetime. Why do people think this person is going to run for president? Dean has been giving pretty persistent clues that he's contemplating a run.  What's the problem? He's scuzzed up his legacy a little bit by becoming one of those lobbyists-that-aren't-officially-lobbyists-but-really-totally-are, specifically one shilling for the health care industry, and providing material for anti-Obamacare Republicans (I realize that's redundant) to gleefully quote. Key quote: Per Jonathan Chait, ""If you are old enough to remember when Howard Dean was running for president in 2004, excoriating fellow Democrats like John Kerry as a 'handmaiden of special interests,' it may be a surprise to find him opining in The Wall Street Journal today in favor of a repeal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board.""Mark Warner Who is this person? Former governor of Virginia, current Virginia senator Why do people think this person is going to run for president? Pollsters, I guess? Also, people remember that he was maybe going to run in 2008. He is a handsome white dude with business experience from a purply battleground state, and sooner or later everyone thinks that handsome white dudes with business experience from a purply battleground state should run for president. What's the problem? The persistent sense that his window has closed, and the fact that he's polling in Iowa in single digits. Key quote: In a 2012 appearance in Iowa (significant!) Warner boldly stated, ""I'll match my business credentials with anyone on the Republican side."" Minutes later, he said, ""I've got no [2016] plans.""Jim Webb Who is this person? Former U.S. senator from Virginia. Served as the secretary of the Navy from 1987 to 1988. Was ""born fighting."" Why do people think this person is going to run for president? Oh, the standard dropping of hints, you know the deal. Asked about a potential 2016 run, Webb told NPR's Susan Page, ""My wife and I are just thinking about what to do next. I care a lot about where the country is, and we'll be sorting that out."" What's the problem? He has fewer problems than you might think. He's got that Scotch-Irish background and an affinity for those ""working class white"" voters who are sometimes all the rage. His career in the Senate was long enough to expose him to an array of issues and policy choices, but not so long that his votes will trip him up. And he's maybe the only articulate person to ever show up on a Sunday morning show. So, that leaves a lack of name recognition, a lack of a fundraising base, and a lack of a connection with a younger generation of voters as his stumbling blocks. Key quote: ""Well, if you look at how I ran for the Senate. I announced nine months before the election with no money and no campaign staff,"" Webb said, adding, ""It takes me a while to decide things and I'm not going to say one way or the other."" Oh, hey, that's okay, everyone's totally looking for a guy who spends a long time deliberating in a president these days.EHHH, THEY PROBABLY WON'T HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DOJohn Hickenlooper Who is this person? Governor of Colorado. Why do people think this person is going to run for president? He's thought of as a ""dark horse"" by political reporters.  What's the problem? He's thought of as ""a guy who I wouldn't vote for president"" by Colorado voters. Key quote: Mitt Romney adviser Stuart Stevens told Buzzfeed's Ruby Cramer that Hillary Clinton would probably lose the 2016 primary. ""Asked what Democratic candidate might beat her, Stevens tossed out just one name: John Hickenlooper."" (Stuart and I maybe need to have a talk.)Janet Napolitano Who is this person? Former governor of Arizona, recently departed head of the Department of Homeland Security. Why do people think this person is going to run for president? Well, she's not ruled it out. Which, to political reporters means she ""may indeed be quietly laying the ground for a 2016 presidential bid."" What's the problem? For better or worse, she's inextricably knit up in the immigration reform issue -- the knotty border security part of it.  Key quote: ""My plate is so full now that that kind of contemplation would be the kind of thing that would keep me up at night, and I lose enough sleep as it is,"" Napolitano said. Kathleen Sebelius Who is this person? Former governor of Kansas, recently departed Secretary of Health and Human Services Why do people think this person is going to run for president? The folks at Emily's List consider Sebelius to be ""waiting in the wings"" if Hillary bows out. And some hopeful soul has set up a Sebelius2016 Twitter account. What's the problem? For better or worse, she's inextricably knit up in Obamacare -- the knotty implementation part of it. Key quote: ""2012 is almost sewn up. Its time to start thinking about 2016 presidential election! Sebelius for President 2016!"" says that ""Sebelius2016"" twitter account, in its last post on March 23, 2011.Antonio Villaraigosa Who is this person? Former mayor of Los Angeles. Why do people think this person is going to run for president? Per the National Journal: ""Villaraigosa is one of the highest-profile Latino leaders in the Democratic Party, and he got more attention as chair of the Democratic convention this year."" What's the problem? ""He has said that his eyes are on the governorship of California, not the presidency."" Key quote: ""After Clinton, Biden, and Cuomo, the next most mentioned Democratic candidate in the 2016 field is Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, who was listed in 10 reports,"" [according to a Smart Politics media analysis. ""... Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick was fifth after being named in nine outlets, followed by Virginia U.S. Senator Mark Warner at eight, and another four possible candidates tied at seven each: New York U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer, and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa."" Hey, he made a list!WAIT, WAIT. WHO, NOW?Steve Bullock Who is this person? Governor of Montana. Okay, but why? Some guy named Jeff Chidester mentioned him in passing in a generic ""Democrats to watch in 2016"" article, and that was enough to convince the The Fix to put him on a similar listicle.  Ehhh, I'm skeptical: Yeah, that The Fix listicle is titled, ""Are you a governor? You are probably thinking about running for president"" and Bullock is on that, for some reason, despite there being not one scintilla of evidence that Bullock is thinking about doing so.Rahm Emanuel Who is this person? Current nine-fingered mayor of Chicago and former White House chief Of staff. Okay, but why? Because The Daily Beast's Lloyd Grove wrote a story that claimed Emanuel was ""toying with"" a bid in the event that Hillary Clinton doesn't run, and then -- you guessed it! -- The Fix got the itchy keyboard finger. Ehhh, I'm skeptical: Ha, yes, well, here's an amazing passage from the Washington Times: ""The take-away suggestion: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is seriously being groomed as a White House contender. 'Maybe in the lead role, maybe the running mate. Hey, he's already been in the White House anyway,' one strategist said to the other."" So, that's TWO anonymous ""strategists"" that were like, ""I dunno, there was that one time I totally saw him in the White House."" (This is about the level of deep political intel you get from anonymous ""strategists."")Russ Feingold Who is this person? Former senator from Wisconsin. Campaign-finance reform crusader. Bailout opponent who was deposed by the anti-bailout tea party in favor of a bailout beneficiary. Okay, but why? Because Public Policy Polling spends most of the time between elections sticking random people into presidential polls and in April of 2014 they jammed Feingold into a poll in Wisconsin. (""Voters in the state clearly favor Clinton as the Democratic candidate. She's at 57 percent, Russ Feingold is at 19 percent, Joe Biden is at 8 percent and Elizabeth Warren is at 5 percent."") Ehhh, I'm skeptical: Well, I'll let Ryan Cooper and Conor Friedersdorf try to convince you otherwise.Amy Klobuchar Who is this person? Senator from Minnesota. Okay, but why? ABC News reported on a Klobuchar trip to Iowa and said, ""There is, after all, no accidental reason for a politician to be in Iowa -- ever.""  Ehhh, I'm skeptical: For Klobuchar's part, she said, ""It simply means I was invited to a wingding, and I think anything in Iowa makes a wingding out of a wingding, and that is all it is."" Joe Manchin Who is this person? Senator from West Virginia. Okay, but why? Bloomberg's Jonathan Allen says that Manchin is ""fed up with the Senate"" and ""chewing on 2016,"" whatever that means. There is also an ""Iowans For Joe Manchin"" Twitter account. Ehhh, I'm skeptical: Yeah, well, Manchin is a pretty big cheese with No Labels so he'd potentially emerge as the preferred candidates of hedge funders and people who like to shout management-cult buzzwords at low-income children and call that a ""charter school education.""Jack Markell Who is this person? Governor of Delaware. I once interviewed him on a step-and-repeat, so he's got that going for him. Okay, but why? The Washington Post needed a name to fill out a 2016 ""March Madness Bracket,"" and they used Markell's. (He was a 14 seed.) The Post's Chris Cillizza told people, ""I've heard people whisper in my ear about Jack Markell potentially for president,"" which tells me more about Cillizza needing to be checked out for auditory hallucinations than it does about anything else. Ehhh, I'm skeptical: ""I'm a Biden guy,"" says Markell, so I'd say you're right to be.Jay Nixon Who is this person? He is the ... hold on, hold on, I know this ... uhm ... governor of something? Oh, right! Missouri. He is the governor of Missouri. Okay, but why? Jay Nixon fills out a list of people that Politico seems to think Hillary Clinton is freezing out of jumping into the race. A hometown newspaper picked that up and ran with it. Ehhh, I'm skeptical: What, you don't think ""President Nixon"" has a nice ring to it? Well, Nixon says, ""I'd be very energetic about hitting the trail for [Clinton] if she decides to make that step forward."" ANY OTHER NAMES I SHOULD REMEMBER?Yeah, sure! Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Deval Patrick, Elizabeth Warren. These are people who have publicly professed that they are not running for president, but they will continue to be asked whether they are by reporters who think they are one inquiry away from breaking them and getting them to confess. Still, there are couple of names on that list that I can see showing up on vice presidential short lists. Elizabeth Warren will continue to be a useful foil to Hillary Clinton by a media that's not interested in the staggering economic problems faced by Americans beyond the cheap contrasts that playing Warren off Clinton will provide for their cocktail parties.Hope this helped, Steven Brill! I'm guessing it probably didn't, but look at what I had to work with, dude.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"

""As soon as they (parents) see their money is not effective in getting their kids to this country, it will stop.""More than 52,000 children traveling alone from Central America have been caught at the U.S.-Mexico border since October, twice as many as the same period the year before.U.S. immigration officials say the crisis is being driven by poverty and gang and drug violence in Central America, as well as rumors perpetuated by smugglers that children who reach the U.S. border will be permitted to stay.House of Representatives Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers said last week that the Obama administration asked for ""too much money"" but declined to say what an appropriate figure would be.Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, also declined to support the spending bill. ""We're not going to write a blank check for over $4 billion,"" he told ""Fox News Sunday."" McCaul is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.McCaul said he would support changing a 2008 law that requires deportation proceedings for children that arrive from countries that do not share a border with the United States. This would allow authorities to quickly deport newly arrived Central American children, as they do Mexican children.McCaul said that bill could see action this summer.""It's a very tragic human crisis at the border, none like I've ever seen before. I think we have to act before the August recess,"" he said.The bill saw opposition from one Democrat, Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas.""That 2008 law, passed under George W. Bush, was passed for a reason,"" he told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""Many people believe that these kids should have a chance to make their case for asylum. So I think we've got to be careful when we consider completely doing away with that law.""Texas Governor Rick Perry pressed the White House to send National Guard troops to the border to aid the border patrol, which has been stretched thin by the mass influx of minors.""They need to be right there on the river because that's the message that gets back to Central America. It's important to do that because this flood of children is pulling the border patrol away from their normal duty of keeping bad people (out),"" he told ""Fox News Sunday.""Perry also said that conversations among Central Americans had been monitored.""We listen to the conversations. Er, I should say that, the conversations are being monitored with calls back to Central America and the message is, 'Hey, c'mon up here. Everything is great. They're taking care of us,'"" he said.

Both missed opportunities won't likely be forgotten soon in Argentina as Germany would go on to win 1-0 in extra time. In the 21st minute of the final at Estadio Maracana on Sunday, Higuain was gifted a scoring chance after a poor header by Germany's Toni Kroos. With no defender between him and Manuel Neuer's goal, Higuain improbably failed to even put his right-footed shot on frame. Higuain believed he had atoned for miss in the 30th minute when he slotted a low shot past Neuer. Unbeknownst to the 26-year-old striker, an official's flag had been correctly raised for offside on the play. Higuain's celebration was cut short and the match remained scoreless into halftime.

17,FIFTY,5 Reasons Retiring Abroad Doesn't Always Work,"Suzan Haskins and Dan Prescher, ContributorInternationalLiving.com Editors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/expat-retirement-_b_5558448.html,"Moving abroad to a place with better weather, a lower cost of living, and decent health care sounds like a no-brainer. It's a wonderful option for anyone looking to improve their current lifestyle and spend less money to do it -- especially for retirees on a limited budget.",2014-07-13,2014 World's Top 10 Retirement Havens from InternationalLiving.com,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb666f52200005700dcca86.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Moving abroad to a place with better weather, a lower cost of living, and decent health care sounds like a no-brainer. It's a wonderful option for anyone looking to improve their current lifestyle and spend less money to do it -- especially for retirees on a limited budget.What could possibly go wrong? Photo by Jason Holland, InternationalLiving.comIf you do your homework beforehand, not a lot. But forego your research and due diligence, and you may have some surprises in store. As we mention in our book, The International Living Guide to Retiring Overseas on a Budget, most of the successful expats we know ruthlessly profiled themselves before they made their move. They spent a lot of time thinking about what their ""deal breakers"" were... the things they couldn't live without if they suddenly couldn't get them where they relocated -- or the things they couldn't live with in their prospective destination.Most of them also tried life on the ground in their chosen destination for weeks or months before they committed to the location to make sure it was really what they imagined it would be.Failing to ruthlessly profile yourself and ""try before you buy"" can lead to what we call ""expat washout."" In our experience, here are the top five issues that will almost always send an expat packing back home.1. Expecting the rest of the world to be ""America Lite"" Many U.S. citizens expect the rest of the world to be just like America, only cheaper. Same services, same products, same infrastructure, same conveniences, same language, same ways of doing things, same view of history, politics, religion... but at half the cost for everything. That most likely stems from growing up and being immersed in what is, for better or worse, the richest, most influential country on the planet. We expect that if everybody else in the world can't be just like us, they certainly want to be and are trying to be and will appreciate us teaching them how to be. Especially for those who have never spent much time abroad, finding out that the rest of the world isn't just a half-price version of the U.S. -- and doesn't much care to be -- can be a shock. The expats who experience this shock either return home or hole up in English-speaking enclaves and try, unsuccessfully, to recreate home around them.2. Startup Costs. It's absolutely true that you can live a high-quality lifestyle for half your current cost of living in many places around the world. But some expats expect their cost of living to go from $5,000 per month to $2,000 per month the day they get off the plane. They forget that, no matter where you relocate, there will be startup costs, like visa and legal costs, deposits on rentals, furnishings, shipping costs if they have containers sent to them, construction costs, remodeling costs... things they encounter from day one in their new location but didn't include in their dream budgets.Researching and planning for these startup costs is crucial to a successful move. Expats who don't do this may quickly get into a financial bind.3. Unrealistic health care expectations. We've found world-class health care facilities in every major metropolitan area of every country we've ever been to. But that doesn't mean that there will be a dialysis center or a heart transplant facility or even a highly-trained emergency medical team with a modern ambulance and a Life-Flight helicopter in whatever little beach town or mountain village you dream of retiring to.In many countries, the quality of medical care outside major metropolitan areas falls off quickly and can approach the downright primitive. As in the U.S., if you want immediate access to the best medical facilities, you have to live near the best medical facilities. Expats who have existing medical conditions and don't spend time on the ground before they move researching the available medical facilities can be sorely, and sometimes dangerously, disappointed.4. Dream Location vs Reality. We see this happen often, and it's even happened to us. Let's say you've dreamed all your life about living on a secluded beach. You've vacationed on some fantastic beaches and always loved the lifestyle as you perceived it. So you buy a little cottage on a stretch of white sand somewhere outside the U.S. at a remarkable price and relocate there. In about six months you realize that being hot and sweaty for a week is one thing, but being hot and sweaty 24-7-365 is another, and that the beach is where they keep the grit and sand and corrosive salt air and bugs, and that during rainy season there is nothing between you and the storms coming in off the ocean and the cascades of runoff coming down from the hills behind you.Likewise, you may have always dreamed of living in the country, away from the crowds and noise... but after six months of driving an hour into town every time you run out of coffee or milk and spending nights in the middle of nowhere by yourself, you realize this lifestyle isn't for you. (Especially if you don't speak the native language and your nearest neighbors speak no English.) You're far more isolated than you ever imagined.The successful expats we know have all visited their prospective destinations during the worst season of the year... and almost every place on earth has a ""low"" season of some kind. They've spent enough time there to know what it's like at all times of the year and all hours of the day and night. Then they either decide they can live with it or they go off in search of another location.5. Simple culture shock. This is actually a subset of #1 above. People in other countries do things differently than you do. They have different priorities; certain things upset them and others don't affect them at all. It comes with growing up in a different culture than yours. If you move into that culture and can't deal with the differences, you won't have a happy time.Don't think this means that you can't complain about fireworks going off at 2 a.m. or loud parties that last 'til the wee hours or about a neighbor that has a loud-mouthed rooster or two and a couple of talkative goats in his back yard. You can complain all you like -- complaining about local customs is one of the most popular expat sports -- but complaining about it to your neighbors or to the municipal government probably won't get you very far at all.You may see where all this is going: if you're not sure about the expat life, the best way to find out if it is for you is to research, research, research. Go. Explore. Check things out. Stay a while. Find out if you can deal with the cultural differences. See if you feel comfortable. If you've done your research ahead of time and you've profiled yourself ruthlessly, you'll most likely have the time of your life. And then you know you've found a home.

By Daniela Soave for High50After his divorce, my friend Tom was delighted when he started seeing someone new on a regular basis. But when he was eventually invited back to hers for more than just a hot drink, it didn't go quite as he had planned.""She was shocked that I hadn't thought about using a condom,"" he told me later. ""But worse than that, once she realised I hadn't had a full sexual health check, even oral sex was non-negotiable.""She made it clear that if I wanted the relationship to progress I'd have to get the all-clear. When did it get so complicated?""Tom's mistake -- and perhaps his salvation -- was to fall in lust with a woman 20-odd years his junior. When he was enjoying his first flush of sexual freedom in the 1980s, safe sex meant not getting girlfriends pregnant. But during the decades when Tom was married and off the market, however, the goalposts moved significantly -- and for good reason.The stats on chlamydia and herpesAs experts have been pointing out for some time, the number of middle-aged and older people who have contracted sexually transmitted diseases has risen meteorically since the millennium.According to the last big study, more men over 45 had developed genital herpes than their 16- to 19-year-old counterparts, and almost 13,000 people over 45 were diagnosed with an STI -- almost twice as many as ten years previously.Chlamydia diagnosis in women over 50 had shot up by 95 percent. Gonorrhea, syphilis, warts - whichever STI you think of, everything was on the up.Since then, the situation has only gotten worse and worse. New strains of STIs are becoming resistant to antibiotics.A condom or a visit to the sexual health clinic?For newly-single people who have been cosseted in a long-term relationship or marriage, sex with relative strangers can be a challenging terrain to negotiate.Educational campaigns have been aimed at the young and as a result 20 and 30-somethings know the rules: condoms for casual sex and full sexual health checks when they move on to exclusive relationships.However, many over-50s feel uneasy about visiting sexual health clinics, despite the fact that they forget about using condoms, because contraception is no longer an issue.Another single friend confirms this. ""None of the women in their 50s who I have slept with were bothered about using condoms,"" he says. ""They saw them in terms of family planning, which they no longer need, rather than safe sex.""As Tom says, our generation is lucky enough to know what spontaneous sex is like without a condom. His relationship with his new girlfriend sadly did not last long enough to benefit from his sexual-health all-clear.""All the same, I did feel like a virgin after I'd got the results,"" he says.

At least 15 Palestinians were killed in new Israeli strikes on Gaza City late on July 12, 2014, medics in the coastal enclave said. AFP PHOTO /THOMAS COEX (Photo credit should read THOMAS COEX/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a8a982300004f01ea023b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Ignoring international appeals for a cease-fire, Israel widened its range of Gaza bombing targets to civilian institutions with suspected Hamas ties and deployed ground troops inside Gaza for the first time early Sunday to raid a rocket launching site in the Palestinian territory. More than 156 Palestinians have been killed. The United Nations estimates that 77 percent of those killed in Gaza were civilians. Four Israeli soldiers were hurt in clashes during the brief incursion to destroy a rocket launching site in northern Gaza, the military said. It said the troops later returned to Israeli territory.It was the first time that Israeli ground troops are known to have entered Gaza in the current offensive. But the operation was carried out by special forces and did not appear to be the beginning of a broad ground offensive.Israeli airstrikes pounded targets in Gaza, with one hitting a center for the disabled and killing two patients and wounding four people, Palestinians. In a second attack Saturday night, an Israeli warplane flattened the home of Gaza police chief Taysir al-Batsh and damaged a nearby mosque as evening prayers ended, killing at least 18 people and wounding 50, officials said.In New York, the United Nations Security Council called unanimously for a cease-fire, but so far, neither Israel nor Gaza's Hamas rulers have signaled willingness to stop.Israel has carried out more than 1,200 air strikes over the six-day offensive to try to diminish Hamas' ability to fire rockets at Israel. Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, has fired nearly 700 rockets and mortars at Israel this week.Israel's chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Motti Almoz, said Saturday there would be more strikes, especially in northern Gaza near the Israeli border. Late Saturday, the military said it was ordering Palestinians in northern Gaza to evacuate ""for their own safety.""Gaza's Interior Ministry urged residents in the area to ignore Israel's warnings and to stay in their homes, saying the announcement was Israeli ""psychological warfare"" and an attempt to create confusion.In a sign that the conflict might widen, Israel fired into Lebanon late Saturday in response to two rockets fired from there at northern Israel. There were no injuries or damage, but Israel fears Lebanese militant groups may try to open a second front.Israel has said it's acting in self-defense against rockets that have disrupted life across much of the country. It also accuses Hamas of using Gaza's civilians as human shields by firing rockets from there.Critics say Israel's heavy bombardment of one of the most densely populated territories in the world is itself the main factor putting civilians at risk. Sarit Michaeli of the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said that while using human shields violates international humanitarian law, ""this does not give Israel the excuse to violate international humanitarian law as well.""The Israeli military has said it has targeted sites with links to Hamas, including command centers, and that it issues early warnings before attacking. But Michaeli said civilians have been killed when Israel bombed homes of Hamas militants or when residents were unable to leave their homes quickly enough following Israeli warnings.An army statement said that from Friday morning to Saturday morning, Israel targeted 158 targets ""affiliated with Hamas terrorism"" in Gaza, including dozens of rocket launchers and a mosque where Hamas stored rockets and weapons.Israel also targeted several civilian institutions with presumed ties to Hamas, widening its range of targets. Palestinian officials said this included a technical college, a media office, a small Kuwait-funded charity and a branch of an Islamic bank.The Israeli military did not mention these institutions in its statement Saturday, saying only that in addition to the military targets, it struck ""further sites.""Gaza Health Ministry official Ashraf al-Kidra said the death toll there reached more than 156, with over 1,060 wounded. Among the dead was a nephew of Ismail Haniyeh, a top Hamas leader, who was killed in an airstrike near his home, Hamas officials said.Though the exact breakdown of casualties remains unclear, dozens of the dead have been civilians. Israel also demolished dozens of homes it said were used by Hamas for military purposes.""Am I a terrorist? Do I make rockets and artillery?"" screamed Umm Omar, a woman in the southern town of Rafah whose home was destroyed in an airstrike. It was not immediately known why the building was targeted.The ""Iron Dome,"" a U.S.-funded, Israel-developed rocket defense system, has intercepted more than 130 incoming rockets, preventing any Israeli fatalities so far. A handful of Israelis have been wounded by rockets that slipped through.On Saturday, air raid sirens went off in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Israel's two largest cities, both located nearly 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Gaza. Most of the rockets were intercepted or fell in open areas.The frequent rocket fire has disrupted daily life in Israel, with most staying close to home. Israeli airstrikes meanwhile have turned bustling Gaza City into a virtual ghost town during the normally festive monthlong Muslim holiday of Ramadan, emptying streets, closing shops and keeping hundreds of thousands of people close to home.The offensive marks the heaviest fighting since a similar eight-day campaign in November 2012 to stop Gaza rocket fire. The outbreak of violence follows the kidnappings and killings of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, and the kidnapping and killing of a Palestinian teenager in an apparent revenge attack.At the United Nations, a Security Council statement approved by all 15 members called for de-escalation of the violence, restoration of calm, and a resumption of direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians aimed at achieving a comprehensive peace agreement based on a two-state solution.The statement also called for ""the reinstitution of the November 2012 cease-fire,"" which was brokered by Egypt, but gives no time frame for when it should take effect.The statement, which is not legally binding, is the first response by the U.N.'s most powerful body, which has been deeply divided on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The Arab League meanwhile said foreign ministers from member states will hold an emergency meeting in Cairo on Monday about the offensive.___Daraghmeh reported from Ramallah, West Bank.

Coming off a demoralizing 7-1 loss to Germany in the semifinals of the 2014 World Cup, Brazil fell behind early in its the third-place match against the Netherlands on Saturday. In the third minute at Nacional in Brasilia, Brazil captain Thiago Silva pulled down fleet-footed Dutch attacker Arjen Robben as he burst into the penalty area for a clear goal-scoring chance. The initial contact appeared to occur just outside of the Brazil penalty area but referee Djamel Haimoudi awarded a penalty kick. He also opted to show Silva a yellow card instead of a straight red. While there may have been initial confusion about the placement and punishment of the foul there was no doubt about Robin Van Persie's kick from the penalty spot. The Netherlands' striker produced an early 1-0 lead with a strong left-footed shot. That lead was doubled in the 16th minute when a ball headed by Brazil defender David Luiz dropped fortuitously for Netherlands midfielder Daley Blind. His right-footed shot from the heart of the penalty area beat Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar. Those two early Dutch scores were the 12th and 13th allowed by Brazil at the 2014 World Cup. That is the highest total ever allowed by Brazil in any single World Cup and more than it surrendered combined at the World Cup in 2002, 2006 and 2010, according to ESPN Stats & Info.The fans in Brasilia reacted accordingly. Brazil would not surrender another goal during the first half, an improvement after allowing an astounding five goals to Germany in the opening 45 minutes of their lopsided semifinal.The Netherlands would add a third goal in second-half stoppage time for the final 3-0 scoreline. The defeat brought a somber end to a once-promising World Cup campaign for Brazil. "
