I've lost count of the number of times I've seen Holbrook perform this one-man show, but it's been more than a few. Last year, for instance, I saw him in San Diego, Nashville, Long Island, and Morristown, NJ. Okay, so I might be a groupie. No two performances are alike. Holbrook's vast repertoire allows him to draw upon thousands of pages of Twain's writing to comment on current events, occasionally confusing audience members who are unaware of Twain's ever relevant commentary. Always flawless, Holbrook's most recent performance dropped my jaw. It was simply his best. Using Mark Twain's words, he commented on every current event from Wall Street to gun violence to evolution to Congress. And more.Like Twain, Holbrook is a legend in his own time. He could rest on his laurels or get by reciting the same passages again and again. After all, Twain's words ring true and powerful, and how many people actually see the show more than once or twice in a lifetime? But, no, that's not Holbrook's way. He is a true Twain scholar -- reading, researching, and rehearsing, and a great actor, unlike others who think wearing a white suit and fake mustache while speaking in an exaggerated drawl are all it takes to portray ""the Lincoln of our literature."" Nope. Holbrook is the real deal. He continues to add lengthy, enticing, thoughtful, even disturbing passages to his act. Oh, you'll laugh. This is Mark Twain, after all. But I predict you'll also squirm, wonder, think, and likely cry, especially with the new material Holbrook has unleashed from Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.I've been rereading Huckleberry Finn since I discovered it as the sequel to Tom Sawyer back in junior high school, getting more out of it with each encounter. Hearing Hal Holbrook last Friday inspired me to share a few keepers. But let these be the teasers. Better you should read (or reread) Huck Finn, and go see Hal Holbrook. And be sure to find me in the audience and say hello. Words of wisdom from Adventures of Huckleberry Finn:All photos courtesy of Mark Twain House"

Both states are among 20 that have already removed criminal sanctions for medical use of marijuana.The federal government still classifies marijuana as an illegal narcotic, but the Obama administration has given states new leeway to experiment with legalized cannabis.In Denver's Civic Center Park near the state capitol, revelers on Sunday gathered to hear music and listened to speakers during a weekend event that organizers billed as the ""world's largest 4/20 rally.""The date of April 20, or 4/20, corresponds to the numerical code widely recognized within the cannabis subculture as a symbol for all things marijuana.Police officers standing by on the fringes of the Denver festival issued 63 citations on Sunday, most for smoking pot in public - a ticket that carries a fine of $150. About half as many were cited on Saturday, police said.At least eight individuals were taken to a detoxification facility for treatment during the two days, police said.Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson said officers have refrained from wading into the crowd to arrest violators, but instead were citing people who openly defied the public consumption ban.""Those ticketed were blatantly in violation of state law and city ordinances,"" Jackson said.Organizers of the rally and city officials beefed up security at the event after three people were wounded by gunfire at last year's rally.Separately, the Cannabis Cup, a trade show sponsored by High Times magazine, drew sold-out crowds over the weekend at a Denver convention venue.The two-day event featured marijuana sampling and workshops, such as how to open a pot shop, cultivation tips, and how to talk to children about weed, according to the event's website.Rachel O'Bryan, spokeswoman for Smart Colorado, an organization that advocates for stricter enforcement of marijuana laws, said the cannabis industry needs to do more to police its own.""People are flouting the law by openly consuming,"" she said. ""We're concerned about the message that sends to our kids."" CELEBRATING WITH BONGS AT A BREWERYIn Seattle, several hundred people who paid $15 a head crowded the cavernous interior of a former brewery where Rainier Beer was made for decades to attend a 4/20 gathering organized by sponsors of the city's annual Hempfest rally.Reggae music played over loudspeakers and the air inside was thick with the sweet, skunky odor of cannabis. But no police were visible at the event, which organizers deliberately held on private space leased from the brewery owners in an industrial section of the city south of downtown.The gathering featured a workshop on how to roll a joint with an entire ounce (28 grams) of marijuana - the legal limit for personal possession in the state - as well as vendors selling pipes and other paraphernalia, and a blind-toke test in which participants tried to distinguish between different strains of pot by sampling them. Attendees ranged from middle-aged baby boomers to a younger crowd from the so-called millennial generation.A cheer from the crowd went up at precisely 4:20 p.m. local time, as many attendees milling about outside lit joints and pipes simultaneously, sending puffs of smoke into the air followed by raucous fits of coughing.One woman in the crowd accepted a joint handed her from a bearded bystander.""You look just like Jesus,"" she exclaimed in an apparent reference to the event coinciding with Easter Sunday. ""How does it feel to be risen?""Doug Medina, 54, said he traveled hundreds of miles with his wife and daughter from Billings, Montana, to Seattle for the 4/20 weekend celebrations there.""It feels a little more open than it did five or 10 years ago,"" he said while smoking a joint outside the brewery.

There was no moment when I sighed with relief at finding that familiar face. I walked into Coachella feeling like just a woman at a concert and very quickly awoke to the harsh reality that I had walked into a strange anthropological experiment. I didn't just feel invisible -- I was invisible. As a 50-year-old -- okay 53 -- the sea of faces is the first thing telling you that you are deeply out of your element. As I was packing to go, I fooled myself into thinking that I was checking the weather to see just how hot it was going to be and what I needed to bring to brave the 100- degree desert sun. But that was a lie. I was actually perusing the Google images of Coachella fashion. I thought I'd see what it took to look Coachella-ish or Coachella -esque. It took me about two seconds to get that this was not going to happen. Without going into too much detail, the cut-off shorts and keyhole mini dress were both out of the question.So now I'm there, in my white jeans (slightly distressed at the knees) and black tank top (the safe 50-plus mommy uniform) doing my self-appointed duty of making sure that I hadn't thrown 16 years of pretty respectable parenting out the window in one indulgent move by letting my daughter run around at a rave. I was a mom on a mission, which somehow made this experiment a little more bearable. I accept that Coachella has become one of those rites of passage for millennials and far be it from me to deny my child that... but along the way I had my own rite of passage: the one where you realize that you are invisible when walking through a vast crowd of strangers under 25 in their own world with their music, their friends, their selfies and their Instagram. I felt a little crappy for a second -- that pang of coming to terms with something for the first time. In that moment the reality of my age rather than the illusion of it came into focus. Then and there, in the middle of the Empire Polo Field I accepted that indeed there are some things that I am now just too old for. Even if I didn't feel my age, whatever that means, -- which I don't -- it didn't mean that I am not my age and that a rave in the 100-plus degree desert with 40 mile an hour winds whipping the sand around was kind of a stupid place for me to be.So I left and went back to the hotel. I was satisfied that by and large my 16-year-old would be safe and would likely come back covered in sand and thirsty but in one piece.   As an aside I did consider how strange it was that Palm desert -- which is the west coasts' answer to retiring to Florida -- for six days a year becomes the coolest place to be for anyone under 25. I wonder if that is the irony of the whole thing: The young come in and take over for a brief moment, while we as their parents are glimpsing the last gasps of knowing what our kids are doing as we look ahead to the hill we are about to be over. So they have their rite of passage and we have ours. But there is still overlap -- musical, emotional and historical. Unlike our parents, who mostly viewed their children's choice of music as noise, our ears are more attuned to handle and even enjoy some of what our kids are listening to. For instance, I listen to Vampire Weekend, 1975, Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Lorde, Ed Sheeran, Kid Cudi among others with my daughter a lot. And in the spirit of everything old is new again, scores of artists are sampling ""old"" songs all the time. So we can still feel secure in the fact that we are not invisible to our children's generation within the confines of our cars and living rooms as long as we remember that we are everywhere else..."

Pro-Russian insurgents defiantly refused Friday to surrender their weapons or give up government buildings in eastern Ukraine, despite a diplomatic accord reached in Geneva and overtures from the government in Kiev.(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1346f240000320076d61e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Alastair Macdonald and Aleksandar VasovicKIEV/DONETSK, April 19 (Reuters) - A mediator from Europe's OSCE security body headed to eastern Ukraine on Saturday seeking the surrender of pro-Russian separatists as the Kiev government declared an Easter truce following a peace accord with Moscow.Gunmen occupying public buildings in Donetsk and other Russian-speaking border towns refuse to recognise an accord in Geneva on Thursday by which Russia, Ukraine and Kiev's U.S. and EU allies agreed that the OSCE should oversee the disarmament of militants and the evacuation of occupied facilities and streets.The coming days may determine whether unrest following the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Moscow president can be contained.Russia, which annexed Crimea last month in the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War, denies running the separatists or planning to invade. Western powers threatened more economic sanctions if Moscow does not prevail on the militants to surrender.Ertogrul Apakan, who heads the special mission in Kiev of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said his deputy would be in Donetsk on Saturday and meet separatist leaders by Sunday to see if they will comply with the agreement.After a meeting in the Ukrainian capital with diplomats from the four parties to the Geneva accord, Swiss envoy Christian Schoenenberger, whose country is chair of the OSCE, said its monitors had spoken to several activists: ""For the time being the political will is not there to move out,"" he said.""That's the task of the monitors, to create this political will, inform the people, so eventually they will understand that the best option for them is to move out,"" he told reporters.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia, who warned on Friday of ""more concrete actions"" to end the stand-off if there were no movement over the Easter weekend, said after the meeting that the senior OSCE officials and the local authorities in the east would ""work out practical steps for the implementation of the Geneva agreement in the course of the next day or two"".In Donetsk, separatist leaders renewed calls for a referendum that could see Ukraine's industrial heartland annexed by Russia. A poll by an institute in Kiev, however, suggested a majority does not favour rule from Moscow, despite widespread suspicion among Russian-speakers of the new leadership in Kiev.Ukraine's government, short of effective forces, has shown little sign of trying to recapture the dozen or so town halls, police stations and other sites seized over the past two weeks, despite proclaiming the launch of an ""anti-terrorist operation"".The Foreign Ministry promised ""the suspension of the active phase of the anti-terrorist operation"" among a list of initiatives to defuse the crisis issued late on Friday. The SBU state security service said the suspension was ""linked to the implementation of the Geneva agreement and the Easter holidays"".The government has explained its lack of visible action beyond setting up security checkpoints by a desire not to hurt civilians. That would risk provoking the intervention Russia has threatened if Russian blood is shed. But lack of resources and training also helps explain the hesitation. Ukrainian troops lost half a dozen armoured vehicles to militants last week.""An Easter truce may show goodwill - or perhaps just Kiev's total impotence,"" said one of the masked men guarding the occupied headquarters of Donetsk's regional government.""If it's impotence, then we've won. If they're getting ready to provoke us, then we will hit back with force.""Several people have been killed in violence in the past week. On Saturday, a serviceman was killed in Donetsk in what the Defence Ministry described as an accident. PUTINAfter weeks of bitter mutual recriminations, Vladimir Putin held out the prospect of better relations with the West on Saturday but the Russian president made clear it would depend on concessions from his adversaries in the crisis over Ukraine.""I think there is nothing that would hinder a normalisation and normal cooperation,"" he said in an interview to be broadcast by Russian state television in which he commented favourably on the appointment of a new head of NATO. ""This does not depend on us. Or rather not only on us. This depends on our partners.""He did not spell out what he hoped the West would do.President Barack Obama's officials made clear on Friday that Russia must prevail on sympathisers in Ukraine to end the sit-ins within days or face graver economic sanctions than limited measures imposed after the seizure of Crimea.Moscow says its interest is only to protect its borders and Russian-speakers in Ukraine from ""fascists"" and others who overthrew President Viktor Yanukovich after he sparked months of protests by rejecting closer ties with the EU.The United States and European Union have imposed limited sanctions on Russian officials over Crimea but are struggling to find a common approach to curbing what they see as a drive by Moscow to recover control of its former empire.Russia has long complained NATO's extension of membership to Moscow's Cold War satellites in eastern Europe and deepening ties to ex-Soviet states like Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine is part of an aggressive policy to undermine it.Years of Western disdain for Russia's struggles with the legacy of the communist collapse also lie behind Putin's demands - hugely popular at home - that Moscow be treated with respect. His spokesman hit back on Friday at threats of sanctions from Washington, saying it treated Russia like a ""guilty schoolboy"".U.S. national security adviser Susan Rice said: ""We believe that Russia has considerable influence over the actions of those who have been engaged in destabilising activities.""If we don't see action commensurate with the commitments that Russia has made ... in Geneva ... then ... we and our European partners remain ready to impose additional costs on Russia. Those costs and sanctions could include targeting very significant sectors of the Russian economy.""Washington did not spell out what further sanctions it might place on Russia. With the EU, it has so far imposed visa bans and asset freezes on a small number of Russians, a response that Moscow has mocked. But some EU states are reluctant to do more, fearing that could provoke Russia further or end up hurting their own economies, which are heavily reliant on Russian gas. UNCERTAINTIESMassive unknowns hang over the situation. Putin's ultimate goal may not be the Crimean-style annexation of Ukraine's industrial heartland, despite his comments in a major public appearance on Thursday in which he recalled that what is now eastern and southern Ukraine was the tsars' New Russia.Many analysts believe Putin is mainly seeking to influence events in Ukraine and ensure a favourable outcome in next month's election following the loss of Russian ally Yanukovich.That in turn raises questions of the role of Ukraine's rich business ""oligarchs"" in the crisis and the election.Conspiracy theories abound in Kiev, according to which the rich and powerful may be fomenting unrest behind the scenes to further their own ends or to curry favour with Putin, who holds sway over the Russian business interests of Ukrainian tycoons.The Ukrainian government has been at pains to show it is ready to meet the demands of people in the east for greater local autonomy and rights to use the Russian language.With a presidential election to replace Yanukovich planned for May 25, it also needs to convince Ukrainians that 23 years of grandiose corruption and economic mismanagement under various leaders might come to end and give the state a better future.A poll by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology for the Zerkalo Nedeli newspaper found less than a third of people in the easternmost regions of Donetsk and Luhansk would vote for rule from Moscow and less than a quarter said they supported the takeover of public buildings in their regions by armed men.Nonetheless, fear of ""fascist"" Ukrainian nationalists in Kiev, and worries for employment in the mines and factories, are widespread: ""I lost my job in February when all of this chaos started in Kiev,"" said mother-of-two Nina Nebesna, 30, as she headed in to Donetsk's stadium to watch the local soccer derby.""Now I can't find work anywhere,"" she said. ""I don't recognise the junta that took power in Kiev. Those boys are standing up for our rights,"" she said of the local militants.Local miner, Mikhail Belogurov, 55, said a move in the Kiev parliament after Yanukovich fell to curb Russian-language rights was ""really stupid"" and he wanted ""the authorities in Kiev to pay more attention to us"". But he was sceptical of the aims of the pro-Russian separatists: ""We don't know who the people in the buildings are,"" he said. "" We don't know what they want.""

How does Panama compare to Nicaragua or Costa Rica, for instance... what about the mountains of Ecuador versus the mountains of Mexico or how do the beaches of Thailand compare to the beaches of Belize?And of course, we're happy to offer our opinions... but you know what opinions are worth. There's no shortage of those out there. Truthfully, as much as we'd like to, we can't pick the perfect overseas retirement destination for you. Only you know what your lifestyle requirements are. Are you a culture vulture who loves city life? Or do you prefer the wide-open spaces of rural life? Are you comfortable with learning a new language? What about activities like fitness clubs, hair salons and shopping malls? How important are those to you? Photo courtesy InternationalLiving.comIf you're thinking about moving overseas and you want to find the place that's right for you, we'd recommend you have a list of your wants and needs. Don't settle for any place that doesn't match up. And remember, don't choose a country, but a community. It's like choosing between Missouri and Arkansas. There's not a lot of difference on a state level, but your experience will be vastly different should you choose to live in Kansas City, Missouri versus little Hot Springs, Arkansas.Just to get you started, we've put together a list of eight factors to consider that may help you choose your overseas retirement destination. Decide how much weight you want to give each one and then see how the place you're considering stacks up.1. Affordability: How does the general cost of living fit with your income and budget?2. Health care: Will you be comfortable with health care options, are good health insurance or hospital plans available to you, and will costs be in line with what you can afford?3. Ease of transition: Are you comfortable with language and currency issues? Are there some familiar items in the grocery stores and pharmacies? (If not, can you live without them?) How easy is it to get a resident visa and to import your household items?4. Accessibility: How close is it to your friends and family back home? Is there an international airport, and are other amenities you'll need (again, such as good hospitals), nearby?5. Community: Is there an expat group? Are you comfortable with the locals and their culture?6. Housing prospects: Are homes for rent or sale at a reasonable price? If you buy a property and later change your mind, will you be able to sell it easily enough?7. Climate: Are you hoping for four seasons or year-round warm weather? It's best to plan your exploratory visit during the worst weather season so you'll know exactly what to expect.8. Things to do: What are your hobbies and will you be able to continue to enjoy those? If you like good restaurants or artistic events, will there be enough of these to keep you busy?You can, no doubt, think of other things that are essential to your quality of life? Is a religious community important to you? What about organic food? Or a good barber or hair stylist? Will you need a car or is public transportation safe, reliable, and affordable? If you have children in tow, you'll want to consider their educational needs. What about your pets? Are there good veterinarians in the community?As you can see, there's a lot to think about. But don't over think it. The more homework you do, the better off you'll be. Ah, but of course, we have more advice... and an easy way to get started on that homework. We have suggestions and input that comes from 13 years of living overseas. We've tried to address every issue we can think of that you need to consider when you approach your own similar adventure. We've compiled all this real-world experience (and not just ours but from dozens of other expats) into our new book, The International Living Guide to Retiring Overseas on a Budget. It can't substitute for your own on-the-ground research, but it will point you in the right direction. Like we've said, this journey of retiring overseas should be fun. If it's not, you shouldn't even consider it. Still, there's no such thing as an irrevocable mistake -- especially if you choose a community and go off to explore it with the idea that you're giving it a trial run. Consider the eight factors we've mentioned here and rent before you buy. That's the very best advice we can give.Related Articles: Start Your New Chapter in Life Overseas Ten Tips for Renting a Home Overseas 6 Reasons Why I Wasn't Crazy for Moving Overseas"

Timothy McVeigh, fueled by hatred of the government he saw as an oppressive tyrant, set off a massive truck bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, tearing away the lives of 168 Americans, including 19 small children in a day-care center.He was one of ours. Although many rushed to declare that the bombing bore all the hallmarks of an attack by foreign Muslim jihadists, they were quickly shown to be completely wrong. McVeigh was a U.S.-born white man, what the Klan of old liked to call a ""100 percent American.""For a moment, it seemed the lesson was learned. Law enforcement officials, many of whom had been skeptical of the whole notion of domestic terrorists, came to see that there was a dangerous underbelly to American society, a world of radical-right activists who were willing to kill. Plot after plot was dismantled as the militia movement coursed through the country. But then came the Al Qaeda attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and it appeared that the lesson had once again been lost.Six days ago, the nation was served with a grim reminder that the United States faces its own homegrown terrorists. A well-known neo-Nazi named Frazier Glenn Cross (formerly Miller) allegedly stormed on to the grounds of two Jewish institutions in Overland Park, Kan., and shot to death three strangers. As he was led away by police who captured him almost immediately, he shouted ""Heil Hitler!""Although the news coverage implied that this was a uniquely horrific attack, the reality is that it was only the latest in recent years. Other known neo-Nazis murdered a guard at the U.S. Holocaust Museum, killed six Sikhs in a Wisconsin temple, tried to slaughter hundreds in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in Spokane, Wash., and more. According to the New America Foundation, right-wing extremists have slain 34 people in the United States for political reasons since 9/11, while terrorists motivated by al Qaeda's ideology have killed 21. That's not to diminish the jihadist threat, but merely to point out that there are others, too.Despite that and other compelling evidence of the domestic threat from the radical right, the Department of Homeland Security, tasked with developing intelligence about such perils, seems to have taken its eye off the ball. Since 2009, when then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano pulled back a DHS report that soberly assessed the threat because certain conservatives were offended by its perfectly accurate observations, the DHS unit that once handled analysis of domestic non-Islamic terrorism has been gutted. Most members quit the agency, disgusted by Napolitano's political cowardice and their own shabby treatment.The work that DHS used to do is needed. As the Southern Poverty Law Center has documented, the last five years have seen an enormous expansion of the radical right, largely driven by the demographic ""browning"" of the population and predictions of the loss of a white majority in the next 30 years. Anger at the dramatic changes occurring in our society is real, and it is steeped in blood.One thing DHS might consider examining is the role of the Internet in breeding and facilitating men like Frazier Glenn Cross. As pointed out by Jeffrey Simon, a scholar of so-called ""lone wolf"" terrorism, all today's lone terrorists need is provided by the Internet, where both technical information about bombs and other weapons is freely available, and where a chorus of moral support can be found.A study by the SPLC, two years in the making and released four days after the Kansas murders, probed the role of an enormous racist web forum called Stormfront that is run by a former Alabama Klan leader. It found that in the last five years alone -- since the election of the nation's first black president -- registered members of Stormfront (an incredible 286,000 people, though many are inactive) have been responsible for the murders of close to 100 people.The killers bore certain hallmarks. They were frustrated, unemployed white men living with their mothers or an estranged spouse or girlfriend. And they typically posted for years before beginning to kill, drawing sustenance and support from their fellow racists and anti-Semites.Cross, too, was nurtured by the Internet -- in his case, by a rival neo-Nazi Web forum known as Vanguard News Network. In recent years, the former North Carolina Klan leader posted there more than 12,000 times.These forums cannot be banned or shut down under American free speech doctrines. But they can provide a rich font of information about those racists and anti-Semites who seek to make change at the point of a gun. It is even conceivable that some early clue about Cross' intentions might have been found.The threat from the homegrown white supremacist movement in America is real. We shouldn't need yet another bloodbath to face that sobering reality, much as many on the political right would like to deny it. Men like Frazier Glenn Cross, who once plotted to assassinate SPLC founder Morris Dees because the civil rights group had sued him for racist harassment, make that only too plain."

It warned of heavier economic sanctions than those already imposed over Crimea if Moscow failed to uphold the Geneva deal - or if it moved to send troops massed on the border into Ukraine.""We believe that Russia has considerable influence over the actions of those who have been engaged in destabilising activities in eastern Ukraine,"" national security adviser Susan Rice said. ""If we don't see action commensurate with the commitments that Russia has made yesterday in Geneva ... then obviously we've been very clear that we and our European partners remain ready to impose additional costs on Russia.""Those costs and sanctions could include targeting very significant sectors of the Russian economy.""President Vladimir Putin's spokesman hit back, while voicing scepticism - of a kind also heard from the Ukrainian government - about how useful the cautiously worded Geneva pact would be.""You can't treat Russia like a guilty schoolboy,"" said Dmitry Peskov. ""That kind of language is unacceptable.""The Russian Foreign Ministry said: ""The Americans are once again stubbornly trying to whitewash the actions of the Kiev authorities, who have embarked on a course of violently suppressing protesters in the southeast who are expressing their legitimate indignation over the infringements of their rights.""Later in the day, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and urged ""full and immediate compliance"" with the Geneva agreement, a senior State Department official said.""He made clear that the next few days would be a pivotal period for all sides to implement the statement's provisions, particularly that all illegal armed groups must be disarmed and all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners,"" the official said.UKRAINIAN OFFERSUkraine's interim government, in power since pro-Western protests forced President Viktor Yanukovich to flee to Russia two months ago, was at pains to show it was keeping its part of the bargain. Its ill-equipped security forces have shown little sign of being able to regain control in the east by force.Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk, though admitting he was not overly optimistic about the agreement solving what has become the gravest East-West crisis since the Cold War, said militants would be offered an amnesty. And he and the acting president made a formal joint broadcast pledging constitutional reform to devolve power to the regions and bolster the status of Russian as an official language in areas where it was widely spoken.Kerry called Yatseniuk and praised him for the amnesty and other measures taken by Ukraine to implement the agreement, the State Department official said.Russia has made much of the presence of far-right ""fascists"" among those who forced Yanukovich out in February. In parliament, nationalists briefly tried to abolish a law allowing the official use of Russian, the first language of many in the 46 million population, and of a majority in the eastern regions.Critics of Putin say that Kremlin-controlled Russian media have fuelled unjustified fear of the new Kiev leadership in the east of Ukraine, where Yanukovich had his power base.But Russia, which Ukraine and the West say is destabilising the new government in order to maintain and extend its influence over its most populous ex-Soviet neighbour, echoed the Donetsk militants in denouncing the authorities' failure to dismantle what is effectively an anti-Russian protest camp in Kiev.The barricaded encampment around Independence Square, known as Maidan, played a crucial role in bringing down Yanukovich after he roused popular anger by rejecting closer economic and other ties with the EU in November. Now, hard-core activists on the square say they will defy any efforts to move them on until a presidential election has been held successfully on May 25.Ukraine's foreign minister warned the militants in the east that they could face ""more concrete actions"" after the Easter weekend if they failed to cooperate with monitors from Europe's OSCE security body and start vacating buildings. But, he said, the Maidan was not an ""illegal"" occupation and so unaffected.Russia's envoy to the European Union said Ukraine was misreading the Geneva accord, ""in particular that it only applies to the eastern and southern provinces and those who are demanding federalism, but not to Kiev, where everything is legal including the ongoing occupation of Maidan"".The Geneva agreement requires all illegal armed groups to disarm and end occupations of public buildings, streets and squares. This week has already seen several people killed in eastern Ukraine, although details remain unclear.The self-declared leader of all the eastern separatists said he did not consider his forces to be bound by the agreement.Denis Pushilin, head of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, told journalists in Donetsk, the regional capital, that Lavrov ""did not sign anything for us; he signed on behalf of the Russian Federation"".First, he said at a news conference in the heavily barricaded, occupied headquarters of the regional administration, Yatseniuk and Acting President Oleksander Turchinov should quit their offices, as they took them over ""illegally"" after Yanukovich was ousted.""The Kiev junta is signing agreements and fulfilling none of them. They are provoking crisis,"" he said. ""Turchinov committed a crime against his own people. We will keep going to the end.""But Alexei, a separatist in nearby Slaviansk, acknowledged that the Geneva talks may have changed the situation: ""It turns out Vova doesn't love us as much as we thought,"" he said, using a diminutive term for Putin, who is viewed by many of the militias in occupied buildings as their champion and protector.FEAR, SUSPICIONMassive unknowns hang over the situation. Putin's ultimate goal may not be the Crimean-style annexation of Ukraine's industrial heartland, despite his comments in a major public appearance on Thursday in which he recalled that what is now eastern and southern Ukraine was the tsars' New Russia.The Kremlin denies any ambition to take territory and many analysts believe it is principally seeking to influence events in Ukraine to ensure a favourable outcome in next month's election following the loss of Russian ally Yanukovich.That in turn raises questions of the role of Ukraine's rich business ""oligarchs"" in the crisis and the election.Conspiracy theories abound in Kiev, according to which the rich and powerful may be fomenting unrest behind the scenes to further their own ends or to curry favour with Putin, who holds sway over the Russian business interests of Ukrainian tycoons.Suspicion of the elites whom they blame for robbing the national wealth and corrupting government and society for the 23 years of post-Soviet independence drives activists on Kiev's Maidan to insist they will not dismantle ""self-defence"" barricades until after they see a fair election next month.""People will not leave the Maidan,"" said 56-year-old Viktor Palamaryuk from the western town of Chernivtsi.""The people gave their word to stay until the presidential elections so that nobody will be able to rig the result. Then after the election we'll go of our own accord.""As shrines to the 100 or so who died in violence on the square became a focus for Good Friday solemnity, when Christians mark the crucifixion of Jesus, many said that weariness after five months of protests would not break their will.""Nobody will take down our tents and barricades,"" said 34-year-old Volodymyr Shevchenko from the southern Kherson region. ""If the authorities try to do that by force, thousands and thousands of people will come on to the Maidan and stop them.""Right Sector, a far-right nationalist group at the heart of battles with riot police in February, saw the Geneva accord as being directed only at pro-Russian separatists in the east.""We don't have any illegal weapons,"" said Right Sector spokesman Artem Skoropadsky. ""We, the vanguard of the Ukrainian revolution, should not be compared to outright gangsters.""Washington did not spell out what further sanctions it might place on Russia. With the EU, it has so far imposed visa bans and asset freezes on a small number of Russians, a response that Moscow has mocked. But some EU states are reluctant to do more, fearing that could provoke Russia further or end up hurting their own economies, which are heavily reliant on Russian gas.
