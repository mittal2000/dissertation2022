He was the wittiest man I ever broke bread with, and he was a quiet philanthropist who saved lives while he was influencing ""the American century."" He improved the quality of life of countless men and women, many of whom died, but many of whom, gratefully, live on. 1991 was a dark time. The gay community, the arts community, was decimated. We needed comfort, we needed hope, and we needed a beautiful space to come together and celebrate life as we struggled to maintain it. The brilliant tributes to Mike that have flooded the media over the last few days capture the extraordinary gifts his talents brought to film, theater, television, comedy and the American consciousness as it has evolved over the last 60 years. What hasn't been said is that Mike not only changed lives; he saved them. Back then, in 1991, when Cynthia ""Cy"" O'Neal told Mike about her idea for a pragmatic spiritual crisis center for people affected by AIDS, Mike immediately said, ""I've been looking for something to do, and this is it."" Cy's vision needed Mike's magic touch -- his ability to pick up the phone and call just about anybody. Together they created Friends in Deed: The Crisis Center for Life-Threatening Illness. Mike was the founding chairman. For 13 years he headed up an eclectic board of creative and powerful people who wanted to serve with Mike because anything done with Mike was as much fun as it was work. Board meetings could be tough, but they were also illuminated by his wit and contagious good will. We had a blast creating brilliant fundraisers: Picture Mike and Elaine May performing some of their classic routines with Simon & Garfunkel (reunited for the first time in over a decade) as their opening act in an intimate Broadway theater; Whoopi Goldberg recreating the one-woman show that Mike had directed for her (after typically recognizing an unusual talent); Mike and Steve Martin performing in a loft for a fortunate few one night; and so many other brilliant evenings that only Mike could have made happen -- and he did, for Friends in Deed, for the clients. Mike was not only a force when it came to fundraising; he was a part of the community. Mike attended many a Tuesday-night Big Group. I can picture Mike's stunning wife, Diane Sawyer, singing Christmas carols by the piano at the annual holiday parties that were lavishly catered with food that they had quietly sent ahead. Clients were not ""other""; they were friends.A former client wrote to me last week, ""I probably wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for Mike Nichols and Cy O'Neal...and everyone who has made Friends In Deed what it has become....""The work continues. Mike became Chairman Emeritus, and Hamilton South and I succeeded him as Chairman (it took two of us to fill his shoes), and today Andy Cohen heads up a vibrant board that supports Cy and the wonderful staff and volunteers. Mike's deed still provides comfort and safety. Friends in Deed serves men and women dealing with any life-threatening physical illness, grief and bereavement, and caregiving at its center in Soho, as well as in groups in Harlem and Westchester County, New York.

I share these concerns.,2014-11-25,"Tony Robbins poses for a portrait Monday, July 26, 2010 in New York. (AP Photo/Jeff Christensen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb316bc220000bb01dbc7d1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"America has discovered a new financial guru. Tony Robbins' new book on investing, MONEY Master the Game: 7 Simple Steps to Financial Freedom, has shot to the top of Amazon's bestseller list.Mr. Robbins, who has been nicknamed the ""mahatma of motivation,"" excels at self-promotion. The publication of his book has generated immense publicity, including a particularly fawning interview with financial pundit James Altucher. Mr. Altucher and his wife posed for a photograph with an ebullient Mr. Robbins on the beach at Mr. Robbins' home in Florida.Based upon pre-publication reports, it was my understanding Mr. Robbins' book exposed the conflicts of interest that brokers and insurance companies have with their clients. He also reportedly advocated that a fiduciary standard should be applied to everyone who provides investment advice. I support these views and endorsed them in a blog I authored. I expressed skepticism, however, about the lack of scientific support for some of Mr. Robbins' self-help theories. Financial journalists who drilled into the merits of the financial advice proffered by Mr. Robbins have skewered his investing recommendations. Barry Ritholtz noted there were significant differences between the Ray Dalio ""All Weather"" portfolio touted in the book and the actual portfolios used by Dalio. He also believes Mr. Robbins' portfolio is over-weighted in bonds, and that back-testing this portfolio after the ""greatest bond bull market in history"" may be misleading.Ritholtz is also concerned with the 15 percent allocation to gold and commodities in Robbins' portfolio, noting that commodities have historically had a negative real rate of return.Others correctly criticized the overblown claims in the blurbs on the back cover. They promise a ""never-before-revealed investment strategy"" and a guaranteed way for investors to ""participate in market gains"" but ""never lose when the market drops."" Cullen Roche, author of a blog called Pragmatic Capitalism, believes Mr. Robbins' bond-heavy portfolio with a commodity tilt will generate ""sub-optimal returns going forward.""I share these concerns.For years now, many financial journalists have advocated a globally diversified portfolio of low management fee index funds. You can find details about these strategies in my Smartest series of books, and in books by John Bogle, Rick Ferri, Allan Roth and my colleague, Larry Swedroe. Our books are based on sound, peer-reviewed research. None of us claim the ability to guarantee outsized returns without comparable risk -- and for good reason.You can find my perspective on intelligent, responsible, evidence-based investing here.Mr. Robbins' newfound success in the financial arena represents the leveraging of his cult-like status as a life coach. His official webpage is certainly impressive, and hardly an exercise in self-restraint.He indicates that he has consulted with members of two royal families, members of the U.S. Congress and three U.S. presidents, not to mention other international leaders. He describes himself as a ""world authority on leadership psychology,"" a ""peace negotiator and humanitarian,"" a ""strategic advisor to world leaders,"" a ""successful entrepreneur and honored business strategist,"" a ""philanthropist,"" an ""award-winning speaker,"" and an ""innovator in psychology and intervention,"" among other accolades. Whew!Dr. Steven Novella questions Mr. Robbins' self-help theories. And he has some impressive credentials. Dr. Novella is an academic neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine and the president and co-founder of the New England Skeptical Society. According to Dr. Novella, Mr. Robbins ""is a successful self-help guru with a schtick that depends upon the scientific illiteracy of his audience."" He dismisses sessions in which Mr. Robbins tells people how to ""unleash the power within"" by walking barefoot over hot burning coals while thinking about cool moss as ""nonsense."" He notes it is the laws of physics that protect your feet, and not ""the ramblings of a self-help guru.""Dr. Novella believes life coaching and self-help programs are generally not evidence-based ""in any meaningful way."" He rejects the notion that just spending time thinking about your life and your goals without direction can affect any real change. He believes most of the advice disseminated by self-help gurus is ""not only improvised, it's largely wrong."" Dr. Novella believes the big sellers in the self-help industry seem to be completely disconnected from scientific evidence. Others have questioned the relentless focus on the power of simplistic, positive thinking that constitutes the premise for many self-help fixes. Barbara Ehrenreich wrote a book on this subject, entitled Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking has Undermined America.If you accept Dr. Novella's view that what Mr. Robbins and many others in the self-help industry are trying to sell you are simply ""made-up easy answers, personality, and gimmicks,"" you should view his newfound status as the latest financial guru with even greater skepticism.Dan Solin is the director of investor advocacy for the BAM ALLIANCE and a wealth adviser with Buckingham.

And when that course is lined with hordes of enthusiastic fans cheering you on, well that's definitely a big plus, too.Oh, and don't forget; a race that's organized and well-planned will make a world of a difference. When you're running a marathon you've already got enough to worry about, all of the extra details (starting line corrals, in-race fuel, etc.) should be taken care of by the race and its organizers. (Especially since you probably shelled out some big bucks for an entry fee, right?)These factors played a big role in helping us rank our list of the world's best marathons. We first began with some simple statistics from Running USA that identified which 2013 marathons were the largest in the United States and the world (largest meaning races with the most finishers).We also factored in the opinions of our readers. We asked you, the marathon runners of the world, which 26.2-mile races are your favorites of all time.To tie it all together, we created a scoring system that awarded points for everything from course quality, event organization and fan ratings based off runner reviews on MarathonGuide.com to the number of 2013 finishers and of course, votes and comments from our reader survey. Now, the results are in and these 25 races have been deemed the best marathons in the world.

It's on that date when the 114th Congress (at least on the Senate side) is scheduled to meet for the first time under its new roster--one that includes at least eight new Republicans senators and the largest Republican majority in the House since the days of Harry Truman. It's safe to assume that the Obama administration is looking forward to January 6 of next year as much as a person looks forward to spending his off-day at the dentist.Senator John McCain, the most persistent critic (and undoubtably the loudest one) of Obama's foreign and national security policy, is on a mission to make sure that the 114th Congress is the administration's worst nightmare in the Washington area. According to John T. Bennett of Defense News, McCain is working behind the scenes to assemble a team in the Senate that will serve as a kind of 'shadow government' to the Obama White House on matters pertaining to national security. The purpose, McCain says, is to hold the administration accountable on the decisions that it has made and provide a set of foreign policy alternatives that he hopes will push President Obama towards a more hawkish direction during his last two years. ""What I think all of us, on an equal basis, want,"" McCain tells Defense News, ""is to coordinate our efforts toward common goals."" If building a coordinated effort will also cause migraines in a White House already struggling to retain the public's confidence, that would be a bonus for newly ascendant Republicans in the chamber.""We have no doubt that Senator McCain will be a formidable adversary as chairman of the Armed Forces Committee,"" a senior administration official told The New York Times. But ""formidable"" might be too temperate a word--if McCain is his old-self next year, the Armed Services Committee will become ground zero for the kind of anti-Obama, anti-dovish, pro-intervention, hawkish sentiment that the senator has been known to blast into the gallery during speeches on the Senate floor. McCain has called the administration's anti-ISIL plan under-resourced and naive, its Syria strategy as ""a failure,"" and its refusal to provide the Ukrainian army with weapons for self-defense purposes ""shameful."" One can imagine a future Chairman McCain using precisely these kinds of adjectives directly to senior administration officials throughout the multiple hearings that he will control from his new perch. Win McNamee/Getty ImagesIf McCain will serve as the honorary president of this new shadow government, Senators Bob Corker, Richard Burr, Lindsey Graham, and Ron Johnson will all be included in his cabinet. Each and every one of these senators has used their status in the chamber to blast President Obama--at times at a personal level. Corker will head up the Foreign Relations Committee come January, and if his time as Chairman will resemble anything like a scathing op-ed that he wrote for The Washington Post this past August (""this president proves that he is uncomfortable being commander in chief,"" Corker wrote), then Secretary John Kerry could be in for a world of hurt when he's asked to represent the administration in public testimony. Richard Burr will perform a similar, but more discreet, role when he climbs to the top of the ladder on the Intelligence Committee--a tenure that could be very different from Diane Feinstein's more confrontational posture towards the Central Intelligence Agency and the controversy over enhanced interrogation techniques. Ron Johnson is predicted to be tapped by the Republican leadership as the next chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, and Lindsey Graham will single-handedly control the purse-strings on U.S. foreign aid. As leader of the State, Foreign Operations Subcommittee on Appropriations, Graham will be able to use his power to set the agenda on which nations receive assistance under the Foreign Military Financing program, how that assistance will be allocated, and whether any conditions will need to be met before the State Department is allowed to release the money. It's a powerful position for an Obama critic that is just as hawkish as John McCain.The McCain-Corker-Graham-Burr-Johnson team, of course, will not have unlimited power--even when Republicans hold the majority in the Senate. As the nation's sole Commander-in-Chief, President Obama has wide latitude on conducting U.S. foreign policy. And on some of the most crucial issues, like negotiations on Iran's nuclear program, the president has the authority to waive U.S. sanctions on a temporary basis without congressional approval. Nevertheless, the Mccain-led ""shadow government"" will still be able to frustrate the White House on everything from the war in Eastern Ukraine to the military campaign against ISIL. Key ambassadorial appointments could be blocked; a busy hearing schedule can be arranged; funds can be withheld; legislation can be formed that force the president's hand; and national security can be elevated as an important topic on the minds of voters ahead of the 2016 presidential contest. John McCain would much rather have been elected president back in 2008, but for a man who was soundly defeated by Obama, being a Shadow President against that very same man is the perhaps the second-best thing that he could have hoped for."

Toussaint's story is that of a woman who was shut down by a culture, rendered powerless, but finds a way back, and in the end, completely comes into her own.This year, coming into her own includes plenty of award season buzz, including the Oscars, about which she says, ""I've never felt more full as a woman. I am bursting with stories, feelings, love, passion, and awareness of myself... The work I do is meant to be gifted and when that gift is valued, it makes my soul hum.""Toussaint has been busy portraying the sociopathic Vee in Netflix's Orange Is the New Black, Lieutenant Joanna Reece in ABC's Forever, and American civil rights movement leader Amelia Boynton in the Oprah Winfrey-produced feature Selma, in theaters Christmas Day. Moreover, Toussaint is already completing work on a Christmas comedy starring Seth Rogen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie, which is scheduled for release in theaters November 25, 2015. Of her experience she says, ""I've never been on a set where entire scenes are improvised... They work in a way that's terrifying and really good for me because it pulls me out of my comfort zone... They are comic daredevils!""Toussaint is also a single mother by ""design,"" and it's this aspect of her life that I focused on in our discussion -- her relationship with her 10-year-old daughter, Samara, and how her own childhood and upbringing affects the way she parents now. What was your childhood like in Trinidad?I grew up a middle class, colonized child of teachers, and librarians and people, women especially, who treasured education. I grew up under the British system, which I think is horrific for children -- very, very strict -- a system that did not recognize children as being individuals. You were small animals earning the right to be human.  Childhood for me then felt extraordinarily powerless, and as an artistic child who learned in alternative ways, it was hell. I was beaten regularly... A good child was a fearful child, and I was a very, very good child, which means I lived in a world of silent, dark terror most of the time. My mom was a [Montessori] teacher and she came to the United States in that wave of the 60's. My mom was a classy woman and she was also middle class. She put all that aside to become a highly overqualified nanny. No one around me had the eyes to recognize that I was in such severe grief (over her mother leaving for the U.S.) that I could barely draw breath. Their response to that grief was actually punishment or emotional deprivation. I used to play the violin. The violin was taken away from me. I tell you this story not because I actually care what went down in my childhood. I care enough to tell you this: Those first 10 years drove me deeply into myself. I went into hiding because it was so unsafe to be out, and so I tried to make myself as invisible as humanly possible and learned early how to just endure. When my sentence was up, and my mom came back to get me and bring me to America, I knew I was never going to look back, and the sun had come out.How do you feel these experiences affected you as a mother?It affected me enormously as a mother. It forged all of my great qualities as a mother. I recognized that you cannot brutalize a child's body without being violent to their spirit. I know what it was like to not have a voice, so my daughter has a voice. I veto that voice when needed because at the end of the day I am the grown-up, but I hear her.What lessons do you want your daughter to take away from Selma?I said, 'I'm taking you with me on this film and you will actually learn about the civil rights movement by walking the walk that Martin walked.'How do you advise Samara on dealing with bullies?I've been raising a compassionate, openhearted child who is a peaceful warrior and have zero tolerance for bullying. We talk a lot. There are certain things in our house that are totally unacceptable -- hurting another person's body or using words as weapons.I hope that whenever my daughter has a negative experience, I'm there to talk about it, and remind her how we feel when it's done to her so that she doesn't do it to others. And you always, always, always tell an adult... Children will talk, you've just got to make sure the village is listening, and then the village has to talk.Do you have time for dating now? No. How do you date with a child? I don't know how. I would like to date. I don't plan to live alone the rest of my life.I'm a mama bear when it comes to my daughter's safety on every level and I don't casually introduce people into our lives... the crap I would tolerate from a guy when it was just me, there's no way in hell that I would tolerate a whole lot of crap when my daughter is bearing witness to it. Is there something as a mother that's unique to you?I want to teach my daughter -- not with my words, but with my being -- how to be in her body. I'm fully inhabiting myself and I don't hide myself. I'm aware that children know all and see all. It's impossible to lie to a child. So I don't try in anyway. What is the best advice about parenting you have received?Follow your instincts... I listen to my belly talk, not my head talk when it comes to my daughter."

Protesters set buildings ablaze and looted stores in the US town of Ferguson on November 24 after a grand jury chose not to press charges against a white officer who shot dead a black teen. US President Barack Obama and the family of late 18-year-old Michael Brown appealed in vain for calm after a prosecutor said a grand jury had found the policeman acted in self-defense.

As we learned about the grand jury's decision last night, the results for most of us were not surprising, but disheartening nonetheless. It disturbed me that instead of deciding whether or not there was enough evidence existing to support an indictment, the jury essentially conducted a full trial. That was not the charge of a grand jury, as I understood it.In addition, many would want America to focus on minute details of this single case and ask that the verdict be accepted, but to do that would miss the forest for much more dense and troubling trees. Perhaps it would be a reasonable request if history did not repeat itself time and time again. However, the killing of Michael Brown is not about one incident, but is another example of how all too often young black or brown unarmed men are being killed by the people who are paid to protect them. Even worse is when our justice system sends out a resounding message that it doesn't care.Perhaps the call to examine this one case would be understandable if justice came more often, but we've seen these unjust acts in communities of more color for far too long. We've seen someone get beat up by four cops on camera; shot in the back while handcuffed in a train station in Oakland; killed at a Walmart in Ohio; choked to death after his football hit a patrol car. We've seen someone shot 41 times reaching for his ID; someone shot 50 times on his wedding night. And another walking into his home and being shot in his bathroom here in N.Y.C. These are but a few, very few, killings where people have been asked to accept that no one will be held accountable and should simply move on. I hope the recent choking death in Staten Island and shooting death in Brooklyn don't join the ranks of unaccountability. Our society must be re-examined at every level, from law enforcement, to criminal justice, to the basic way we relate to each other. By not indicting Officer Wilson, our society appears to place the officer above the law, especially in context with the multitude of cases before this one. Elected officials in Missouri and across the country must advocate for a cultural-systemic shift within their police departments to reform the broken system that consistently targets men and women of more color. With that in mind, we must sustain our unity and have our emotions fuel a relentless pursuit of reform. And yes, I join the family of Michael Brown in asking for protests of peace, as long as others who have the same request join in the call for justice and equity. JUSTICE and EQUITY are what people deserve. And the pursuit of JUSTICE and EQUITY are what people should hear, so they can fully understand the call for peace. In 2014, it should not be this difficult, by virtually every single statistical metric, to be black in America."

The report indicates that whatever international efforts have been made to wean local farmers off the crop have failed. (AP Photo/Rahmat Gul)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6916e92600000223b62e98.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What If It Weren't Us?Cross-posted with TomDispatch.comLet’s play a game, the kind that makes no sense on this single-superpower planet of ours. For a moment, do your best to suspend disbelief and imagine that there’s another superpower, great power, or even regional power somewhere that, between 2001 and 2003, launched two major wars in the Greater Middle East. We’re talking about full-scale invasions, long-term occupations, and nation-building programs, first in Afghanistan and then in Iraq.In both countries, that power quickly succeeded in its stated objective of “regime change,” only to find itself mired in deadly conflicts with modestly armed minority insurgencies that it simply couldn’t win. In each country, to the tune of billions and billions of dollars, it built up a humongous army and allied “security” forces, poured money into “reconstruction” projects (most of which proved disasters of corruption and incompetence), and spent trillions of dollars of national treasure.Having imagined that, ask yourself: How well did all of that turn out for this other power? In Afghanistan, a recent news story highlights something of what was accomplished. Though that country took slot 175 out of 177 on Transparency International’s 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index, though its security forces continue to suffer grievous casualties, and though parts of the country are falling to a strengthening Taliban insurgency, it has for some years proudly held a firm grip on one record: Afghanistan is the leading narco-state on planet Earth.In 2013, it upped its opium poppy cultivation by 36%, its opium production by almost 50%, and drug profits soared. Preliminary figures for this year, recently released by the U.N., indicate that opium cultivation has risen by another 7% and opium production by 17%, both to historic highs, as Afghanistan itself has become “one of the world’s most addicted societies.”Meanwhile, where there once was Iraq (171st on that index of kleptocracies), there is now a Shiite government in Baghdad defended by a collapsed army and sectarian militias, a de facto Kurdish state to the north, and, in the third of the country in-between, a newly proclaimed “caliphate” run by a terror movement so brutal it’s establishing records for pure bloodiness. It’s headed by men whose West Point was a military prison run by that same great power and its bloodthirstiness is funded in part by captured oil fields and refineries.In other words, after 13 years of doing its damnedest, on one side of the Greater Middle East this power has somehow overseen the rise of the dominant narco-state on the planet with monopoly control over 80%-90% of the global opium supply and 75% of the heroin. On the other side of the region, it’s been complicit in the creation of the first terrorist mini-oil state in history, a post-al-Qaeda triumph of extreme jihadism.A Fraudulent Election and a Collapsed ArmyThough I have no doubt that the fantasy of relocating Washington’s deeds to Beijing, Moscow, Tehran, or any other capital crumbled paragraphs ago, take a moment for one more experiment. If this had been the work of any other power we thought less well of than we do of ourselves, imagine the blazing headlines right now. Conjure up -- and it shouldn’t be hard -- what the usual war hawks would be spouting in Congress, what the usual suspects on the Sunday morning talk shows might be saying, and what stories cable news networks from CNN to Fox would be carrying.You know perfectly well that the denunciations of such global behavior would be blistering, that the assorted pundits and talking heads would be excoriating, that the fear and hysteria over that heroin and those terrorists crossing our border would be somewhere in the stratosphere. You would hear words like “evil” and “barbaric.” It would be implied, or stated outright, that this avalanche of disaster was no happenstance but planned by that same grim power with its hand on the trigger these last 13 years, in part to harm the interests of the United States. We would never hear the end of it.Instead, the recent reports about Afghanistan’s bumper crop of opium poppies slipped by in the media like a ship on a dark ocean. No blame was laid, no responsibility mentioned. There were neither blazing headlines, nor angry jeremiads, nor blistering comments -- none of the things that would have been commonplace if the Russians, the Chinese, or the Iranians had been responsible.Just about no one in the mainstream excoriates or blames Washington for the 13 years leading up to this. In fact, to the extent that Washington is blamed at all for the rise of the Islamic State, the focus has been on the Obama administration’s decision not to stay longer in Iraq in 2011 and do even more of the same. (Hence, President Obama's recent decision to extend the U.S. combat role in Afghanistan through at least 2015.)All in all, we’ve experienced a remarkable performance here when it comes to not connecting the dots or feeling the need to assign responsibility or accountability for what’s happened in these years. In some fashion, we Americans continue to see ourselves, as we have since 9/11, as victims, not destabilizers, of the world we inhabit.To add to this spectacle, the Obama administration spent endless weeks helping engineer a fraudulent Afghan presidential election -- funded in part by the opium trade -- into a new, extra-constitutional form of government. The actual vote count in that election is now, by mutual agreement of the two presidential candidates, never to be revealed. All of this took place, in part, simply to have an Afghan president in place who could ink a new bilateral security agreement that would leave U.S. troops and bases there for a further decade. If another country had meddled with an election in this fashion, can you imagine the headlines and commentary? While reported here, all of this again passed by without significant comment.When it comes to a path “forward” in Iraq, it’s been ever deeper into Iraq War 3.0. Since a limited, “humanitarian” bombing campaign began in August, the Obama administration and the Pentagon have been on the up escalator: more air strikes, more advisers, more weaponry, more money.Two and a half weeks ago, the president doubled the corps of American advisers (plus assorted other U.S. personnel) there to 3,000-plus. Last week, the news came in that they were being hustled into the country faster than expected -- specifically into dangerous, war-torn al-Anbar Province -- to retrain the American-created, now thoroughly sectarian Iraqi army, reportedly in a state of remarkable disarray.In the meantime, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey, the Pentagon, and the White House continue to struggle over whether American boots can be put on the ground in a combat capacity, and if so, how many and in what roles in a “war” that essentially may have no legal basis in the American system of government. (Shades of Afghanistan!) Of course, much of this internecine struggle in Washington is likely to be obviated the first time U.S. advisers are attacked in Anbar Province or elsewhere and boots end up hitting the ground fast, weapons firing.Vietnamizing Iraq, Iraqicizing VietnamIn the meantime, think about what we would have said if the Russians had acted as Washington did in Afghanistan, or if the Chinese had pursued an Iraq-like path in a country of their choosing for the third time with the same army, the same “unified” government, the same drones and weaponry, and in key cases, the same personnel! (Or, if you want to make the task easier for yourself, just check out U.S. commentary these last months on Ukraine.)For those of a certain age, the escalatory path the Obama administration has set us on in Iraq has a certain resonance and so, not surprisingly, at the edges of our world, familiar words like “quagmire” are again rising. And who could deny that there’s something eerily familiar about it all? Keep in mind that it took less than three years for the Kennedy administration to transition from the first several hundred American advisers it sent to Vietnam to work with the South Vietnamese Army in 1961 to 16,000 armed “advisers” in November 1963 when the president was assassinated.The Obama administration seems to be in the grips of a similar escalatory fever and on a somewhat similar schedule, even if ahead of the Vietnam timetable when it comes to loosing air power over Iraq and Syria. However, the comparison is, in a sense, unfair to the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. After all, they were in the dark; they didn’t have a “Vietnam” to refer to.For a more accurate equivalent, you would have to conjure up a Vietnam scenario that couldn’t have happened. You would have to imagine that, in May 1975, at the time of the Mayaguez Incident (in which the Cambodians seized an American ship), just two weeks after the South Vietnamese capital Saigon fell, or perhaps even more appropriately in terms of the dual chronologies of the two wars, in December 1978 when the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia, President Gerald Ford had decided to send thousands of American troops back into Vietnam.Inconceivable as that was then, only such an absurd scenario could catch the true eeriness of the escalatory path of our third Iraq war.Four More Years! Four More Years!Try to imagine the reaction here, if the Russians were suddenly to send their military back into conflict-ridden Afghanistan to refight the lost war of the 1980s more effectively, bringing old Red Army commanders out of retirement to do so.As it happens, the present war in Iraq and Syria is so unnervingly déjà vu all over again that an equivalency of any sort is next to impossible to conjure up. However, since in the American imagination terrorism has taken over the bogeyman-like role that Communism once filled, the new Islamic State might in one sense at least be considered the equivalent of the North Vietnamese (and the rebel National Liberation Front, or Vietcong, in South Vietnam). There is, for instance, some similarity in the inflamed fantasies Washington has attached to each: in the way both were conjured up here as larger-than-life phenomena capable of spreading across the globe. (Look up “domino theory” on the meaning of a Communist victory in South Vietnam if you doubt me.)There is also at least some equivalency in the inability of American leaders and commanders to bring the nature, or even the numbers, of the enemy into sharp focus. Only recently, for instance, General Dempsey, who has played a crucial role in the launching of this latest war, rushed off on just the sort of “surprise visit” to Baghdad that American officials often made to Saigon to proclaim “progress” or “light at the end of the tunnel” in the Vietnam War. He met with American Marines at the massive U.S. embassy in that city and offered an assessment that seemed to capture some of Washington’s confusions about the nature of its newest war.Keep in mind that, at the moment the war was launched, the Islamic State was being portrayed here as a monster movement engorging itself on the region, one that potentially imperiled just about every American interest on the planet. In Baghdad, Dempsey suddenly insisted that the monster was faltering, that the momentum of battle in Iraq was “starting to turn.” He then labeled the militants of the Islamic State as ""a bunch of midgets running around with a really radical ideology"" and concluded that, despite the nature of those formerly giant, now-puny fellows and the changing momentum of the war, it might nonetheless take “years” to win. On his return to Washington he became more specific, claiming that the war could last up to four years and adding, “This is my third shot at Iraq, and that's probably a poor choice of words."" Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers recently offered a similar four-year estimate, but tagged an “or more” onto it. (Four more years! Four more years! Or more! Or more!)Despite their sudden access to crystal balls some 11-and-a-half years after the initial invasion of Iraq, such estimates should be taken with a grain of salt. They reveal less a serious assessment of the Islamic State than just how shaky America’s top leadership, civilian and military, has become about what the U.S. is capable of achieving in the wake of an era of dismal failure in the Greater Middle East.In reality, unlike North Vietnam in 1963, the Islamic “State” is a wildly sectarian rebel movement that sits atop what is at best a shaky proto-state (despite recent laughable news reports about claims that it will soon mint gold or silver coins). It is not popular across the region. Its growth is bound to be limited both by its extreme ideology and its Sunni sectarianism. It faces enemies galore. While its skill in puffing itself up -- in Wizard of Oz fashion -- to monstrous size and baiting the U.S. into further involvement may be striking, it is neither a goliath nor a “midget.”General Dempsey can’t know how long (or short) its lifespan in the region may be. One thing we do know, however: as long as the global giant, the United States, continues to escalate its fight against the Islamic State, it gains a credibility and increasing popularity in the world of jihadism that it would never otherwise garner. As historian Stephen Kinzer wrote recently of the movement’s followers, “To face the mighty United States on Middle Eastern soil, and if possible to kill an American or die at American hands, is their dream. We are giving them a chance to realize it. Through its impressive mastery of social media, the Islamic State is already using our escalation as a recruiting tool.”Awaiting Iraq War 4.0Given all this, it should amaze us how seldom the dismal results of America’s actions in the Greater Middle East are mentioned in this country. Think of it this way: Washington entered Iraq War 3.0 with a military that, for 13 years, had proven itself incapable of making its way to victory. It entered the latest battle with an air force that, from the “shock and awe” moment it launched 50 “decapitation” strikes against Saddam Hussein and his top officials and killed none of them but dozens of ordinary Iraqis, has brought none of its engagements to what might be called a positive conclusion. It entered battle with an interlocking set of 17 intelligence agencies that have eaten the better part of a trillion taxpayer dollars in these years and yet, in an area where the U.S. has fought three wars, still manages to be surprised by just about any development, an area that, in the words of an anonymous American official, remains a “black hole” of information. It has entered battle with leaders who, under the strain of fast-moving events, make essentially the same decision again and again to ever worse results.In the end, the American national security machinery seems incapable of dealing with the single thing it was built to destroy in the 9/11 period: Islamic terrorism. Instead its troops, special ops forces, drones, and intelligence operatives have destabilized and inflamed country after country, while turning a minor phenomenon on the planet into, as recent figures indicate, an increasing force for turmoil across the Greater Middle East and Africa.Given the history of this last period, even if the Islamic State were to collapse tomorrow under American pressure, there would likely be worse to come. It might not look like that movement or anything else we’ve experienced thus far, but it will predictably shock American officials yet again. Whatever it may be, rest assured that there’s a solution for it brewing in Washington and you already know what it is. Call it Iraq War 4.0.To put the present escalating disaster in the region in perspective, a final analogy to Vietnam might be in order. If, in 1975, you had suggested to Americans that, almost four decades later, the U.S. and Vietnam would be de facto allies in a new Asia, no one would have believed you, and yet such is the case today.The Vietnamese decisively won their war against Washington, though much of their country was destroyed and millions died in the process. In the U.S., the bitterness and sense of defeat took years to recede. It’s worth remembering that the first president to launch a war in Iraq in 1990 was convinced that the singularly tonic effect of ""victory"" there was to “kick the Vietnam Syndrome once and for all.” Now, all of official Washington seems to have a post-modern, twenty-first-century version of the same syndrome.In the meantime, the world changed in few of the ways anyone expected. Communism did not sweep the Third World and has since disappeared except in Vietnam, now a U.S. ally, tiny Cuba, and that wreck of a country, North Korea, as well as the world’s leading state on the “capitalist road,” China. In other words, none of the inflamed fears of that era panned out.Whatever the bloody horror, fragmentation, and chaos in the Middle East today, 40 years from now the fears and fantasies that led Washington into such repetitively destructive behavior will look no less foolish than the domino theory does today. If only, in a final thought experiment, we could simply skip those decades and instantly look back upon the present nightmare from the clearer light of a future day, perhaps the next predictable escalatory steps might be avoided.

We forget how to love or let love in. We lose our ability to feel, to think, and to act, in cherishing ways and inadvertently push the people we most care about away.Stress is sensory overload. Love, at its best, is sensory openness.Our senses -- touch, smell, taste, seeing, hearing, and intuition -- are how we experience ourselves and others. When we are stressed, we lose access to our senses, and therefore lose our ability to connect intimately, and our partners may give up in frustration.When We Lose ""Touch"" We lose access to our sense that is our weakest link first. If it is touch, we are no longer able to differentiate whether a physical connection will be demanding or healing. We encase ourselves in an invisible bubble, shutting the world out in order to cope. If our partner relies on touch to feel loved, we inadvertently send the message that we no longer care.When We Lose Emotional Availability When we are stressed, behaviors that would normally be slightly irritating feel like major disruptions. The more protective part of your brain is in fight-flight mode, ready to react or disconnect at a moment's notice. You're tired and wired and any emotional request from your partner is overwhelming. Innocent questions like, ""How are you, sweetheart?"" bring out irritated reactions: ""How do you think I feel? I'm overloaded. Isn't that obvious?"" Anger is easy, and patience is in short supply. You're aware that you're reacting poorly, so you promise yourself you'll be better as soon as ""things let up.""When Our Thoughts Are Scrambled When our frontal lobes have been uncharacteristically scrambling to sort ideas and resolve problems, we are unable to share our thoughts with our partners. Our partners, who are used to solving problems together, offer suggestions, hints and support. But because our thinking is off-kilter, we can't trust outside interference as it further confuses us. We invalidate the offers and make our partners feel stupid or inappropriate: ""Can't you see I'm trying to figure something out? If I need help, I'll ask you."" Your partner is justifiably hurt, rejected, or offended. When Our 5 Senses Suffer Some of us lose access to enjoying the sights, sounds and smells of life. A partner who hasn't showered smells sexy when you're balanced, but offensive when you're stressed. A restaurant can't be enjoyed because food just ends hunger, it doesn't awaken the taste buds. Our vision and hearing narrows and we can only focus on solving the immediate problem ahead. We can't listen to stories or details or day's events, nor see beyond what's stressing us out. For example, when we come home stressed and sleepless, and our partner has prepared our favorite dinner, we can't see it. We stare directly ahead and focus on something mundane: ""Where's that folder I left on the counter? It was right here. Did you throw it out for God's sake?"" Our partner will either try to anticipate our every move to avoid being stung, or will write us off impossible to be satisfied. When Intuition Loses Insight Intuition is one of our most crucial capabilities to loving and being loved. The special glances, warm affectionate sounds, and open arms easily fall prey when someone is preoccupied with prolonged worry about something else. We can only pick up subtle facial expressions, voice intonations, and body language when we're tuned in. Prolonged stress depletes a relationship of its most important components: present-time deep attentiveness and the ability to live in one another's hearts. Stressed-out people cannot maintain those gifts. They forget how to love or allow love to penetrate their preoccupied and pressured world. That disconnect from their own inner experiences transfers into becoming separate from the one they love.How To Re Connect The fastest way to de-stress is to get back in touch with your own six senses. It will bring you back into the present. Take time to breathe and deeply reflect. Remember how sweet it is to touch and be touched. Look at life with your lens wide open, taking in the beauty of all you can see, as would a blind person newly restored to sight. Listen to the sounds that regenerate you; music, laughter, humor, and the sweetness of your lover's voice. Pick things up around you and press them to your face. Take a deep breath and breathe in the memories that emit from their scent. Let yourself taste things you love again. And let your imagination open up to possibilities again, thinking beyond the concrete into all that is possible, and live in the mind and heart of your partner.Love will return.Dr. Randi's free advice e-newsletter, Heroic Love, shows you how to avoid the common pitfalls that keep people from finding and keeping romantic love.

Manufacturing was down, far less tangible industries were up. Income inequality and nostalgia for a time when America “made things” became fixtures of the national conversation.As Roger Martin put it in the Harvard Business Review in October, “Over the past 50 years the U.S. economy has shifted decisively from financing the exploitation of natural resources to making the most of human talent.” “Talent” has a positive ring. And yes, there are some good things about an economy that favors talent -- that is, creative workers, as opposed to what Martin calls “routine-intensive labor.” Many of these creative people will flourish, and some of them will even “make things” that could truly improve people’s lives. But Martin, an author and former dean of the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, says a talent economy has a dark side, too.“I started to take a dimmer view when I realized there was a large segment of talent that created no net benefit to society, and that segment was achieving the highest personal rewards in the modern economy,” he told The Huffington Post.The disappearance of labor-intensive jobs, he argues, has accelerated income equality. Worse -- and hardly a shock to anyone paying attention -- many of those raking in billions at the very top aren’t exactly doing meaningful work. As others languish, this talent segment enjoys stratospheric gains.Martin has articulated, at the HBR and in blog posts, his thoughts on what this means for the future of the American economy. HuffPost asked him to share his thoughts on something a bit closer to home: what it all means for young people starting out. If you want a successful career in the talent economy, but you also want to do something that might have meaning, or benefit society in some way, what might you want to know? What might you want to avoid? What follows is his reply: Build Value, Don't Trade ItThe core imperative for a happy and fulfilling career in the modern talent economy is to focus your talent on building value, not simply trading it.  The paragon of the latter activity is the hedge fund manager, who simply trades value – and tolls it heavily on the way through. On behalf of his or her capital providers, the hedge fund manager trades liquid financial instruments. The only way to make a dollar for the capital providers is for someone on the other side of trade to lose a dollar. The hedge fund manager keeps 20 cents of the dollar of profit and gives the remaining 80 cents to the capital providers, making it a massively lucrative activity for the hedge fund manager. And in a great asymmetry of incentives, the capital providers absorb 100 cents of every dollar of loss, while the hedge fund takes none of that loss.   Minimal net value for society is created in this process. Value has just been transferred from the counter-party in the trade to the hedge fund manager and capital provider. Or vice versa: if the hedge fund manager loses money for its capital providers, the counter party walks away with the profit – and that counter-party might well be another hedge fund manager.  Huge Profits Don't Equal Huge SatisfactionWhile it is a wonderfully profitable business for hedge fund managers, it provides little long-term satisfaction because it is a zero-sum game with equal and opposite magnitude of losers and winners. Over time, if you are in a value trading business, you have to wake up every morning knowing that, in order to make a dollar, you have to ensure someone else loses one.  If instead you work for or establish a company that builds a product or offers a service that makes the lives of its customers better off, and if the revenues from selling the product/service exceed the costs by enough to earn an adequate return for investors, then you live in a positive-sum game. Customers are better off than they were before having access to your product/service. The company makes enough money to invest in growth, which means hiring employees and buying machinery/equipment/real estate, all of which contribute to growing the economy.  In this case, you can go to bed every night knowing that you contributed value to customers, employees, shareholders and the overall economy. And if you do all of this in an environmentally sustainable way, you make the world a better place for your children, too.Building Is Harder Than Trading -- But Also More RewardingThe challenge for this path is that building value is harder work than trading value. It is difficult to figure out a way to generate new value to a particular group of customers and do so in a way that the value created (and therefore paid by them) is distinctly higher than the costs incurred. That is an inherently creative act -– even if it is done in the context of an existing company in an existing product line. The forces of competition erode existing value equations and demand the continuous process of upgrading value delivered and improving costs of doing so.  Trading value is much easier. Someone else has to create all the value, and all you need to do is shuffle it around and toll the players involved. The greatest skill required is that of convincing the providers of capital to traders to give you the capital to enable your trading -– even if they really shouldn’t. Raising capital is the greatest skill of hedge fund managers.  Hedge fund management is arguably the most lucrative occupation in America and is much easier than creating value. But the payoff to working harder and longer at the task of building net value for society is the satisfaction of using your talent for the world, not just for yourself. "

Republicans still feel better about their Congressional leaders than they did before the election, when just about as many were unfavorable as were favorable. But unfavorable ratings of the two have increased [among Republicans] from last week’s post-election low, up ten points for Boehner, and up 12 points for McConnell. And Republican favorable percentages for the two were down 12 and 14 points, respectively."" [YouGov]YES, 2014 WAS A WAVE ELECTION - Harry Enten and Dhrumil Mehta argue it's time for Democrats to stop blaming the map for their lost Senate majority: ""Even if you control for the fact that a large number of races took place in red states, the Republican performance was the fourth-best by either party in the 17 Senate cycles since 1982. How did we come to this conclusion? We compared the margin of victory in almost every Senate race since 1982 with two factors: the presidential vote margin for the previous two elections3 in the states with Senate contests, and whether the incumbent was running...The average Republican candidate for Senate outperformed what we would have expected given the map by 8.5 percentage points. This graphic plots how well the average Senate candidate did versus what the model expected. It shows that the Republican performance in 2014 rivals other big waves of the past... Only in 1994, 2008 and 2010 did the average Senate candidate for one party outperform by more than he or she did in 2014....This year was different from other wave years because of the unusually strong influence of the presidential vote in individual states in the last two cycles. It explained over 75 percent of the variation in results across the races this year. That’s the highest ever."" [538]But candidates mattered - More from Enten and Mehta: ""[I]t would be a mistake to say that individual candidates didn’t matter in 2014. Taking into account the fact that Republicans nationally outperformed as a group, a few candidates did considerably better than expected."" They single out Alaska Sen. Mark Begich who ""should have lost by closer to 10 percentage points than the actual 2,"" Senator-elect Cory Gardner who significantly outperformed the fundamentals and ""ran arguably the best campaign in the country,"" and two contests in ""blue tinted"" states that ""went in completely different directions,"" as both Republican Joni Ernst in Iowa and Democrat Gary Peters in Michigan did better than incumbency and past presidential voting would have predicted. HILLARY CLINTON'S EARLY NH LEAD IS 'HISTORIC' - Lisa Lerer: ""Hillary Clinton holds a historic lead in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, although a shift in opinion about the party's brand could be a drag on her candidacy in the general election. Sixty-two percent of likely Democratic voters in the early primary state said they support Clinton in a new Bloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm New Hampshire Poll of likely primary voters conducted by Purple Insights. It's an advantage that puts her in elite company: Only former Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy in 1980 and former Vice President Al Gore in 2000 have broken the 50 percent mark more than six months before the primary."" [Bloomberg]And Rand Paul shows 'early strength' - John McCormick: ""Republican Rand Paul is showing early strength for a possible 2016 presidential bid in the first primary state, where a Bloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm New Hampshire Poll shows him running slightly ahead of more established names. When 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney is removed from the mix, the Kentucky senator and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie share the top spot, with each drawing 16 percent support from likely Republican primary voters. Romney, who has repeatedly said he has no plans to run for president a third time, leads the potential pack with 30 percent when included....With Romney removed from the list of potential candidates, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has the next highest level of support at 14 percent, followed by neurosurgeon-turned-conservative-activist Ben Carson at 9 percent...The retired doctor registered higher than the 8 percent received by former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, 7 percent for 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, 5 percent for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, 4 percent for Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and 3 percent for Texas Governor Rick Perry."" [Bloomberg]Poll used live callers - The poll of 989 New Hampshire voters sampled both landline and mobile phones and included oversamples sufficient to bring the total number of 2016 Democratic and Republican primary voters to just over 400 interviews each. Although previous Purple Insights polls used an automated (IVR) methodology, Managing Partner Doug Usher confirms to HuffPollster that live interviewers made all calls on the new survey. [Full results via Bloomberg]But wait... - Stu Rothenberg, via Twitter: ""Really, don't start following the 2016 presidential race now. Take a break. Nothing that is written about it now is important. Nothing."" [@StuPolitics]MILLENNIALS DON'T THINK EVERYONE SHOULD VOTE - HuffPollster: ""Young Americans aren't just less likely to vote than their older compatriots. They're also less likely to believe that everyone should cast a ballot, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. Most Americans age 45 and over say everyone should vote, according to the survey. But people under 30 are more than twice as likely to say that only the well-informed should cast a ballot as they are to say that all eligible citizens should do so….Younger Americans are the most likely to overestimate how many people voted in the most recent election….While 27 percent of all Americans said they'd think less highly of someone who didn't vote, just 18 percent of Americans under 30 agreed.""

14,WOMEN,Here's What Women Have To Say About The Bill Cosby Accusations,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-bill-cosby-twitter_n_6211842.html,,2014-11-24,"Comedian Bill Cosby performs during a show at the Maxwell C. King Center for the Performing Arts in Melbourne, Fla., Friday, Nov. 21, 2014.(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fece3c000018010d1dff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With more than 15 women publicly accusing Bill Cosby of sexual assault, it's unsurprising that the conversation surrounding the allegations has taken place on Twitter. Famous for being the family man of television, the 77-year-old comedian's cultural presence has often protected him from widespread scrutiny, but the last two months have marked a tipping point in the court of public opinion. Since a clip of comedian Hannibal Buress calling Cosby a rapist when viral in October, the accusations from women against Cosby have snowballed. Despite women coming forward on a nearly daily basis since earlier this month claiming that the comedian had drugged and sexually assaulted them, many people still seem to refuse to see any possible truth in these women's stories. Apparently, for some it's difficult to see the comedian as anything but Cliff Huxtable, the perfect dad he played on ""The Cosby Show."" Many women on Twitter however, are explaining why they believe the allegations and stand with the women who have spoken up. Cosby has largely remained silent on the issue, though his lawyer Martin Singer released a statement calling the media's coverage of the allegations ""an unprecedented example of the media’s breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards."" The comedian also told Florida Today in a Nov. 21 interview: ""I know people are tired of me not saying anything, but a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos. People should fact check. People shouldn't have to go through that and shouldn't answer to innuendos.""Here's what women on Twitter think about the allegations made against Cosby and how we should be reacting to them: re: Bill Cosby I sort of think where there's smoke there's fire. The 13 women Bill Cosby raped and assaulted had been speaking out for decades, but it wasn't until an act by comedian that people listened."

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"" - EMMA LAZARUSImmigrant-turned-billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk already made an indelible mark on America. He blazed trails in finance with PayPal and in transportation with Tesla. And if he has his way, SpaceX will take us to Mars. Musk is a risk-taker and game-changer, and his journey underscores the power of the American immigrant. But unless Congress acts to expand the number of temporary work visas for immigrants, the U.S. could lose its vitality as a nation of immigrants. Too many qualified foreign students are sent home after graduation. Indeed the gap between student and temporary employment visa issuances has widened extensively over the past decade.It is a story of demand and supply. While the quota of temporary work visas has been stagnant for the past decade, demand for student visas more than doubled. There just aren't enough temporary work visas.Musk's story illustrates what is possible when immigrants that come to the U.S. are allowed to stay in the country. Indeed he was the inspiration for Jon Favreau's movie version of Iron Man, beloved by millions of Americans. Born and raised in South Africa, Musk has said he felt American from an early age.""I am nauseatingly pro-American,"" he said ""I would have come here from any country. The U.S. is where great things are possible."" Musk studied physics and business at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1990s. Having entered the country on a student visa, he obtained a temporary work visa after graduation from Penn. About a decade after arriving to the New World he was sworn in as an American citizen.Musk's mission upon graduation was to tackle what he perceived as the world's biggest challenges: the Internet, sustainable transportation and space. PayPal has made online transactions fast, secure and broadly available. With Tesla, he made electric cars viable, and with SpaceX rockets reusable. In the process, he created thousands of jobs for Americans. The U.S., no longer the only land of opportunity, will need to do more to keep the energy and creativity of tomorrow's immigrants. With economic competition across the globe as never before the U.S. can no longer afford the luxury of rejecting talented immigrants. Historian Niall Ferguson calls this shift the end of 500 years of Western predominance. In less than a decade, China may overtake the United States as the world's largest economy. The greatest trump card the U.S. still has is the world's best higher education system. Students from around the world aspire to study here. But those students will not contribute to the U.S. economy if they are forced to leave. ""We need to take a look at our immigration laws,"" Musk said at the annual conference of the U.S. Export-Import Bank. ""We really don't want to send them home."" Dave Munichiello, Partner at Google Ventures, said that among the entrepreneurs he invests in, immigrants have made for particularly strong candidates. Through the challenges immigrants face, they develop drive, resiliency and a strong work ethic.Google was co-founded by Sergey Brin, who was born in Moscow to Russian Jewish parents. He immigrated with his family to the United States when he was six years old. The biological father of Steve Jobs was Syrian. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, was born in Paris to Iranian parents. Venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers reported that 60% of the top 25 tech companies were founded by 1st or 2nd generation Americans. In total, they created $577 million of revenue in 2013 and employed around 1.2 million people. Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway, says that the U.S., unlike any other nation, has developed a system that unlocks human potential. If the U.S. wants to keep its vitality and economic strength, it needs to unlock the human potential of its future immigrants."

The new iPetition counter-response claims that ""the Duggar Family is under attack from anti-marriage advocates for standing for traditional marriage,"" and has just over 56,000 signatures at the time of this post. Another petition supporting the family, located here, had over 183,000 signatures when this story was published.The controversy is a long-time coming, as the Duggar family has exhibited anti-LGBT sentiment at different points throughout the course of their time in the spotlight. In August, Michelle Duggar was tapped to record a robocall against an Arkansas anti-discrimination housing law that specifically affected the transgender community. The reality star was quoted as saying that transgender individuals are ""males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female"" and opposed letting transgender people use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.More recently, the Duggars enraged the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community when the couple posted a photo of themselves kissing and encouraged other married couples to follow suit. When John Becker of LGBT blog The Bilerico Project posted a photo of him kissing his husband -- accompanied with a message about marriage equality -- the photo was reportedly taken down and Becker was banned from the Duggar's page.TLC has not responded to requests from The Huffington Post for comment about the petitions."
