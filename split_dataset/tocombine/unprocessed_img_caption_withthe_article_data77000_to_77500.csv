0,POLITICS,Some Inmates Who Met Pope Francis Are In Jail Only Because They're Poor,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-francis-prison_us_560978aae4b0768126fe6508,Many wouldn't be incarcerated if they could afford bail.,2015-09-29,Pope Francis spoke at the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility on Sunday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5609b8491900002f00fde9b6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA -- When Pope Francis visited an overcrowded prison on Sunday, he talked to inmates about the need for ""rehabilitation"" and for inmates to get ""back on the right road."" What he may not have realized is that most of the inmates being held in Philadelphia's Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility have not yet been convicted of a crime.Some of the inmates who met Pope Francis have been charged with serious crimes, such as murder, rape or robbery, which judges may decide require them to be locked up in the interest of public safety until their case is resolved in court. But others have been charged with much less serious offenses and are being held only because they cannot afford to purchase their freedom as they wait for the justice system to resolve their case. The vast majority of the people at the facility are there because they have not made bail. They have not yet been convicted, meaning they are supposedly presumed innocent. One inmate HuffPost spoke with has been there for more than two years, and his case is just being resolved. Another inmate who is being sentenced now has already been behind bars for 23 months. Yet another has been in for 19 months and still not been sentenced.Watch them talk about the situation:Poor inmates often end up spending more time behind bars than they would have if they had just been immediately convicted of the crime they were charged with. One inmate interviewed by The Huffington Post called bail ""outrageous"" and noted that being locked up for months can have devastating effects on people's lives. Two inmates who met Pope Francis and were interviewed by The Huffington Post back-to-back following the visit were charged with DUIs. Both were being represented by a public defender. One had his bail set at $75,000 and would have to pay $7,500 in cash to get out. He's spent nearly five months behind bars and is awaiting his formal arraignment.The other had his bail set at $5,000 and would need $500 to get out. Unable to produce that amount, he's been behind bars since June.""Even if I get found guilty, it's a 48-hour sentence. I'm going to be here for four and a half months before I even get to trial,"" Michael M. told The Huffington Post. ""It just doesn't make any sense."" He said he's spent ""about two minutes"" with his public defender since he got locked up.Another inmate, Steven, said in an interview ahead of the pope's visit that he has only spent a short time with his public defender.""I don’t feel that we are innocent until proven guilty, I feel that we’re guilty from Jump Street,"" he said.The need for changes to the bail system in Philadelphia has been discussed for years. The chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said in 2012 that the system should be modernized and ""perhaps has not served the court system and the community well."" The man who will almost certainly be the next mayor of Philadelphia, Democratic candidate Jim Kenney, is reportedly planning an overhaul of the bail system.In his speech to inmates, Pope Francis talked about hope, saying it is ""painful when we see prison systems which are not concerned to care for wounds, to soothe pain, to offer new possibilities. It is painful when we see people who think that only others need to be cleansed, purified, and do not recognize that their weariness, pain and wounds are also the weariness, pain and wounds of society.""Video edited by Amber Ferguson.Also on HuffPost:"
1,POLITICS,This Time Ben Carson Didn't Say He'd Violate Muslims' Civil Rights,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-carson-muslims-rights_us_560961e0e4b0768126fe36b9,"He's made shocking comments about Islam, but this wasn't one of them.",2015-09-29,"Maybe this time, Ben Carson didn't grasp the full dimensions of the question.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560979d01900003000fde8dd.jpeg?cache=GdlADaeNRz&ops=crop_38_137_3962_2201%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson did not back down on Sunday from controversial comments he had made a week earlier about Muslims and American values. Indeed, he seemed to add a new layer to the uproar when he answered a question about mass surveillance of religious minorities arriving as refugees.""I personally don't feel that way, but I would certainly be willing to listen to somebody who had evidence to the contrary,"" Carson told ABC News' Martha Raddatz. ""I think that's one of the problems -- we get to our little corners, and we don't want to listen to anybody anymore.""Some media outlets gave the impression that Carson's answer meant he favors unfettered tracking of anyone coming into the country, especially if the noncitizens are outside America's religious mainstream.""Carson: I'd Consider Religion As Probable Cause For Searches,"" read a Politico headline. ThinkProgress had a similar headline on its website.That would be troubling. But, for once, it might not be fair to say Carson went there.Raddatz's own question was framed in legal terminology that might not have been clear to a nonlawyer like Carson. First, she referred to a comment he made two weeks earlier, when he said that allowing Middle East refugees to enter the U.S. ""carries extra danger."" Then she asked Carson about the intersection between religion and the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.""Let's imagine some of those refugees get into the United States,"" Raddatz prefaced her question. ""For authorities to track emails, cell phone calls, they usually need to have probable cause. Do you think, in some instances, religion should be enough for probable cause?""Raddatz stepped into a complicated legal debate over the protections of the Fourth Amendment there. It raises issues from dragnet surveillance of civilians to government spying on religious minorities to national security. Courts across the country have grappled with these questions, and as with other civil liberties in the post-9/11 world, the law is far from settled. Just last month, for example, a conflicted U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned a lower court that had ruled that bulk collection of telephone metadata violated the Fourth Amendment.Simply put, the Constitution does not allow the police to search Muslims just because they're Muslims. But in the realm of national security, the legal questions are often not that simply put.Because of the ongoing uncertainties, it's not at all surprising that Carson's answer is an equivocal mess: ""I personally don't feel that way, but I would certainly be willing to listen to somebody who had evidence to the contrary.""Carson may have been caught off guard and failed to wrap his brain around his answer. For that matter, Raddatz may not have been fully aware of the multiple implications of her question.In a perfect world, Carson would've said flatly, ""No, religion should never be a basis for probable cause to search anyone."" But if we're going to give him the benefit of the doubt, his suggestion that he's willing to at least hear out ""somebody who had evidence"" on a matter outside his expertise is not a bad quality in a potential White House occupant."
2,POLITICS,"Jeb Bush Donors Are Not Panicking. Or Are They? Really, Who Can Tell?",Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb-bush-donors-panic_us_56056f40e4b0dd8503074380,"Politico is pretty sure something is happening with Bush donors, so they'll just report both things.",2015-09-29,"Pictured: the candidate who's got all his backers nervous, or possibly not.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560ada031b00003000dfdd0c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Something is going on with Jeb Bush's campaign these days. Maybe something bad? But maybe something good -- the intel is fuzzy. Luckily, we have journalists to sort it all out. Journalists like Politico's Eli Stokols, who reported on Tuesday that the Bush campaign is working very hard these days to relieve the ""angst"" of its donors -- one of whom rates the level of ""panic"" at ""six or seven"" out of 10.Or maybe the panic level is not that high? The reason I am wondering is because Politico's Ben White also reported Tuesday that ""Bush donors"" are ""not panicked."" As in, you know, zero on the scale of zero-to-10. The null set of panic.I don't know. Maybe the person who should be panicking is Eli Stokols, now reporting live from beneath the bus his colleague threw him under? Let's get this sorted out.According to Stokols' report, the Bush campaign has, in recent days, gone to great lengths to assure the candidate's notoriously fainthearted donors that despite all the talk about his faltering poll numbers, that ""low energy"" barb from Donald Trump that seems to be sticking, and the simultaneous elevation of his Florida rival Marco Rubio, the donors are still backing the right horse because of Bush's clear ""lead in the political prediction markets."" Only... well, there was a bit of hiccup. Per Stokols:Just one problem: Beginning Sunday night, PredictIt, the biggest of the online sites and the one referenced last week by top Bush advisers and confidants, placed Marco Rubio ahead of Bush at the head of the GOP pack.That's basically been the consensus reporting from this weekend, after The Washington Post reported that Bush's ""top donors"" were ""warning that the former Florida governor needs to demonstrate growth in the polls over the next month or face serious defections among supporters.""Compounding this problem is the perception that Scott Walker's exit from the race has primarily benefited Rubio. By the way, this is one of my favorite aspects of the primary process: the part where the staffers and donors who'd backed early-flameout candidates are then mysteriously reborn as vital assets to be ravenously coveted and courted by the candidates who remain.Both the Rubio and Bush camps have tried to position themselves as the primary haven for Walker's exiles, and apparently there is no former Walker personage too obscure to qualify as a ""get."" Here, for example, is Des Moines Register reporter Jennifer Jacobs tweeting about the Bush camp's success in landing the support of one of Walker's Iowa interns! But the media narrative is in, and Rubio is the winner, according to Politico and The Wall Street Journal.So it's not surprising when Stokols reports that ""the perception that Rubio is a stronger communicator has taken hold and is affecting fundraising at the quarter's end, according to sources in both camps."" To counter the tidal force of these perceptions, Stokols says that the Bush camp is reminding its flighty donors about a couple of its own not-insignificant advantages: the Bush team has a lot of money, and it has a lot of organization.Rather than view White's clashing report as a refutation of Stokols' newsgathering skills, perhaps we should simply see it as evidence that at least a few lucky Bush donors, having downed this particular batch of Kool-Aid, felt totally comfortable circling back to Politico with assurances that everything is going to work out. As one of ""several"" who talked to White put it:“43 is a surrogate, Laura Bush is a surrogate, Barbara Bush is a surrogate, Columba Bush is a surrogate, so are Jeb Jr. and George P, plus others, each of whom can swing well north of $50K an event. This is a structural advantage that far outweighs the negative of the Bush name, especially given the reality that the Rs may be running against Clinton Inc, the most formidable money machine in history.”Ehhh, you know, leaving aside the sliding scale value of each of those surrogates, the whole idea that Bush is the one candidate capable of raising money in the general election (at an oh-so-quaint $50K a pop, at that!) is frustratingly naive. Maybe it's just much easier to quell the panic of the frustratingly naive donors? Regardless, it appears the message from Bush's team is going down well enough that at least one donor was happy to parrot it right back to White: ""Bottom line, Jeb is the only grownup with money, a message and organization. Time is, as the Stones say, on his side.""And that's fair: A large campaign war chest and a zealously constructed campaign infrastructure are the sorts of things that will pay much greater dividends in January than they're paying at the moment. Of course, perhaps the real story here is that beneath its confident veneer is a Bush campaign that's every bit as concerned about its current lackluster state as its donors are. As Stokols notes, the Bush campaign will be confronting its near-term problems by putting $25 million worth of ads on the airwaves beginning next month.So hey, don't worry, Bush donors, everything is gonna be fine, like, so fine, it's probably not even a thing, man.Also on HuffPost: "
3,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Calls Out Obama Team On Global Drug Prices,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-michael-froman-drug-prices-poor-countries_us_560aea3ce4b0dd850309818b,The Democratic presidential hopeful invoked Pope Francis in his appeal.,2015-09-29,Bernie Sanders wants Obama's administration to ensure drug prices are low in poor countries.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560aecd31900003000fdeb1a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Monday urged the Obama administration to reverse its opposition to a proposal aimed at preventing drug price increases in the world's poorest countries.""Making sure people in poor countries have access to life-saving medicine is our moral responsibility,"" Sanders wrote in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman. ""I respectfully ask you to reconsider this position.""In February, poor countries asked the World Trade Organization to exempt them from patents and other intellectual property standards for medicines. Such rules grant companies long-term monopolies, dramatically driving up the cost of treatment by preventing generic drugs from entering the market.AIDS and HIV treatment once cost thousands of dollars a year in poor countries before generics were introduced for about $1 a day. The WTO will rule on the plan in mid-October. In public the Obama administration has been mum on the proposal all year, despite pressure from high-profile public health groups including Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam and Knowledge Ecology International. In his letter, Sanders said that his staff had learned that the government does not support the proposal. Sanders, an independent Senator from Vermont, quoted Pope Francis’ concern for the poor in his letter and called the proposed introduction of a more lenient international medicines standard an opportunity to fight global poverty.Under the proposal, any country classified by the United Nations as a ""Least-Developed Country"" would be exempt from granting patents and other monopolies on medication. Unlike prior exemptions, this one would last for as long as the U.N. classifies a country as ""Least-Developed,"" making it easier for poor countries to make longer-term public health plans. The current exemption for LDC countries expires in January.The U.N. Development Programme and the Joint U.N. Programme on HIV/AIDS have both said that the failure to approve the new proposal could jeopardize the public health of huge numbers of people worldwide.“Millions of people rely on access to affordable, assured quality generic medicines,” Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS, said. “WTO members have before them a critical opportunity to help least-developed countries to reach health and sustainable development goals -- failure to support them could put millions of lives at risk.”Froman's office declined to offer any details on the administration's thinking when contacted by The Huffington Post. “USTR has received Senator Sanders’s letter regarding the World Trade Organization (WTO) TRIPS Agreement, and we will respond to him directly regarding its contents,"" USTR spokesman Andrew Bates said in a written statement provided to HuffPost. ""The United States has agreed to all past extensions of TRIPS Agreement waivers for LDCs, and we are working at the WTO in Geneva with LDC members to find an appropriate solution.”Major pharmaceutical companies, record labels and movie studios have long supported aggressive intellectual property standards as a method of securing higher profits. The Obama administration has supported such policies in a host of international forums, to the chagrin of public health advocates. Read the full Sanders letter here. "
4,BUSINESS,These 5 Companies Are Trying To Spark A Parental Leave Revolution,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parental-leave-coalition_us_560990f0e4b0af3706dd4ba0,They have a lot of work to do.,2015-09-29,The U.S. is the only industrialized nation that doesn't provide workers paid leave through public policy.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5609932b1800002b00831225.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A handful of big corporations are trying to lead the way to improve working conditions for new parents -- and fill the void left by the U.S. government. At the Clinton Global Initiative meeting on Tuesday, they announced the formation of the Working Parent Support Coalition.Five companies so far have joined the coalition, including the U.S. arms of Danone, Nestlé and Barclays, as well as private equity shop KKR and consulting firm Ernst & Young. The group hopes to attract many more. Cornell University and the American Academy of Pediatrics have also signed on to offer support and research.""The real opportunity here to make the gap between reality and policy smaller and smaller by having companies step up,"" Luciana Nunez, a Danone managing director who came up with the idea, told The Huffington Post. ""This is the beginning. We want more companies on board,"" she said.The U.S. is the only industrialized nation that doesn't provide workers paid leave through public policy. Some typically white-collar employees are lucky enough to get paid maternity leave. But not that many. Only 21 percent of private employers offer paid maternity leave, according to a survey from the Society for Human Resource Management. By contrast, 98 percent offer paid holidays. To move the needle on these issues, you need both private-sector action and public policy reforms. ""In order to support working parents and help them thrive both at work and at home, it's going to take a lot of players,"" Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute, told HuffPost. ""The earlier assumption was [that] it's just public policy, but it also takes working on the cultural issues."" A high-profile group like the Working Parent Support Coalition can lead the way to change, she said.To join the coalition, companies must make some kind of commitment toward improving the quality of life for employees who are new parents. Then, with the help of the Clinton Global Initiative, companies will track the effectiveness of their programs: Are people actually taking all the leave offered? Do workers who receive such support stay with their jobs longer? The coalition says it will make that information publicly available, in order to help business figure out what actually works.""These policies are only good if people use them,"" Paul Bakus, Nestlé's president for corporate affairs, told HuffPost. Nestlé announced in June that it's increasing the amount of paid leave it offers parents from six to 14 weeks, starting next year. Bakus said the increase will cost the company, although he would specify how much. He added that offering a decent amount of paid leave is simply ""the right thing to do.""Danone's Nunez said offering better leave improves the health of employees and their children. She said it also fits with the company's mission to encourage more mothers to breastfeed babies for longer periods. ""In the U.S., the most important reason moms stop is because they go back to work,"" she said.Danone, which sells Dannon yogurt and Evian water among other things, has committed to extending the amount of paid leave that it offers primary caretakers in the U.S. from 6-12 weeks to six months, starting next year. Consulting firm Ernst & Young, which already offers fairly generous benefits to new parents, is looking at ways to encourage more men at the company to take paternity leave.""You're starting to see a lot of companies make changes, and this area of maternal health is becoming more visible. Now's the time to put fuel on the fire,"" said Bakus.Indeed, elite employers seem to be engaging in an arms race this year to offer the best benefits to white-collar workers. Netflix now gives new parents up to a year off. Facebook, Adobe and Microsoft have also beefed up the amount of leave allowed. In finance, companies like KKR now offer posh perks like paying for a caregiver to accompany a new mother on work-related travel during the first year of a child's life.Unfortunately, the benefits arms race hasn't extended to low-paid workers who desperately need paid leave. Danone's Nunez said she hoped the new coalition would attract companies who employ hourly and lower-paid workers."
5,POLITICS,Republicans Ready For December Shutdown As Boehner Exits,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-december-shutdown_us_560aa8c4e4b0af3706dde150,The GOP's most conservative members aren't backing down.,2015-09-29,"""This December is probably going to be the worst ever; I think some really bad things could happen,"" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560ab4041b00003000dfdc95.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Congress may currently look like a bit of a mess after coming to the cliff of a government shutdown and backing away, but December will be the real test for the legislature.Both chambers are preparing to pass a clean government funding measure and send it to the president on Wednesday for his signature, hours before the Sept. 30 deadline. The problem is that the bill only includes enough money to keep the government running until Dec. 11, at which point the battles already raging in Congress will hit a fever-pitch.With House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) exiting at the end of October, the December deadline will be in the hands of new leadership -- presumably current House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who is running to replace Boehner. If conservatives have their way, McCarthy will listen to them more than his predecessor did and take an aggressive stance on core conservative policies, forcing as many presidential vetoes as possible.Coming out of a Republican conference meeting on Tuesday morning, lawmakers warned that with the party in flux, December could prove a nightmare. Members of the House Freedom Caucus, who edged Boehner out, will fight to have a say in the leadership scramble Boehner's resignation has set in motion. They want a speaker who will force confrontations on must-pass bills like government-funding measures.Conservative members plan to stake their flag in the ground when the next government funding battle starts in December, vowing to once again press whoever is the next speaker to attach provisions that strip Planned Parenthood and Obamacare funding, and restrict money from being used to implement the president's Iran nuclear deal. ""This December is probably going to be the worst ever; I think some really bad things could happen,"" Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said of the next funding deadline, alluding to a possible shutdown over such controversial issues.Huelskamp added that conservatives plan to meet with everyone running for leadership posts, and interview them to see if they meet their criteria. It's a stunning change from the normal process, and could lead to further division within the conference. ""You just can’t change our leaders and have anything different -- you have to change the process, you have to change the procedure, and that’s what we have yet to hear from those running for speaker,"" Huelskamp said. But a majority of House Republicans are upset about Boehner's departure and the minority in their ranks sending a rift through the party. ""These guys have set impossible standards,"" said Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) coming out of Tuesday's meeting. ""They want Obamacare repealed, it cant be done so long as President Obama is the president. I mean, their enemy is not Boehner or McConnell, it’s the Constitution.""King expressed cautious optimism that a new speaker like McCarthy could actually solve the ever-growing problem between Republicans. ""Kevin may have the ability to smooth things over, but the factual issues are going to be the same,"" King said. ""They’ve set these unrealistic goals, and they condemn people for not reaching them. ... We can’t have a government shutdown.""Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), who is mulling a bid for House majority whip in the leadership shuffle, also admitted to the struggle waiting for Congress in December.""It’s going to be difficult,"" he said. And even with a new speaker poised to take over, some conservative members aren't convinced any change will come to the Republican caucus. ""I don’t really know Kevin that well but I know that conservatives are not ready to have him,"" said Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) ""If you are going down the same path and repeat the same mistakes that you had under the soon-to-be previous speaker, then you’re not getting anywhere.""If conservatives are successful in convincing the next leader to force through a long-term government funding measure with the Planned Parenthood and Iran nuclear provisions attached in December, they will need to carry the legislation on their own, as Democrats have vowed to oppose such riders. And the president will veto it once it reaches his desk, possibly leading to the second government shutdown in two years. Michael McAuliff contributed reporting. "
6,COLLEGE,One Way To Make College Worth It: Help Students Feel Like Someone Cares About Them,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/college-worth-it-mentors_us_560aa371e4b0af3706dddc18,"A new report serves as an endorsement for the value of fraternities, sororities, honors colleges and other communities.",2015-09-29,"The campus of Purdue University is seen in West Lafayette, Indiana.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560ab5a21b00003000dfdc99.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you ask someone who graduated from college in the past decade whether their education was worth it, their answer is going to depend a lot on whether they felt like someone on campus took a personal interest in their success.Recent alumni who had a strong, supportive relationship with a professor or mentor are almost twice as likely to say college was worth it, regardless of what kind of school they attended, according to a Gallup-Purdue University report released Tuesday.""We know that integration and that deep engagement by the student is also predictive of retainment,"" said Brent Drake, Purdue's head data officer. ""But that's also holding true to their future success once they've graduated.""Tuesday's report measures how recent graduates feel about their college experience, how they're faring in the workforce and what effects their student debt has had on their lives.The report also suggests that universities would be better off if they spent less money on ""state-of-the-art fitness facilities, dining halls and posh dormitories"" -- in other words, acting like a country club -- and focused more on improving relationships on campus for their students. On a five-point scale, just half the respondents in the Gallup-Purdue report rated their college experience as having been worth it. But that number jumped among students who said they felt like someone cared about them and their success, and among students who had a mentor of some sort. ""Higher ed in general is not placing value and rewards on that kind of thing, so this is probably happening in spite of the lack of value and rewards,"" said Brandon Busteed, executive director of education and workforce development at Gallup. For recent graduates with $25,000 or more in student debt, the data shows they're twice as likely to feel the cost of their education was worth it if they felt fully emotionally supported during their time in school.""It's kind of a game-changer,"" Busteed said. ""The relationships in college are a game-changer in the value of your education."" Contrary to widespread perception, the Gallup results don't suggest that small liberal arts colleges have an advantage over their larger university counterparts -- a belief that Busteed called ""unimaginative."" The report doesn't give a specific definition of ""mentor,"" but Busteed said that a mentor figure could be a faculty member, an older student, an adviser or a counselor, among other possibilities. If anything, the report suggests the value of fraternities, sororities, honors colleges and other living-learning, residential communities.One easy way for a school to strengthen its mentoring resources without spending a lot, Busteed said, is to reach out to alumni. ""Alumni are the largest number, in terms of human capital,"" he told The Huffington Post. ""Almost everybody asked the question [about being a mentor] is willing, but they just need to be asked.""""It's not easy, but it's not costly,"" Busteed added. ""We can easily scale it.""Also on HuffPost:"

9,BUSINESS,Here's Everything We Know About The New Tesla Model X,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tesla-model-x-electric-suv_us_560abe2fe4b0af3706ddfe60,Vroom vroom. Tesla's all-electric SUV debuts today.,2015-09-29,"Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors Inc., introduces the Model X car at the company's headquarters Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2015, in Fremont, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FREMONT, Calif. -- Amid great fanfare and expectations, Tesla Motors unveiled the Model X, its all-electric SUV, at an event Tuesday night at its Bay Area factory. The Model X is the second car available for sale from the electric automaker, which introduced the Model S sedan three years ago. The high-speed Roadster, its first car, was discontinued in 2012.The all-wheel-drive, seven-passenger X could help Tesla crack into the SUV market. The vehicles experienced a surge in sales over the past year and are popular with female drivers. Shoppers can put down $5,000 on Tesla's website to reserve an X when they start rolling out. The base price actually runs up to $132,000 for the Signature Series, which includes add-ons like an autopilot mode and heated steering wheel and seats. A less expensive version, the $35,000 Model 3 sedan, is expected to come out in 2017. The X boasts a lot of power. It goes from o to 60 mph in 3.2 seconds, and has a range of about 250 miles before the battery needs a recharge. Plus, it's stylish. A new feature, the ""falcon wing doors,"" swoop out and up. (It's easy to picture ""Silicon Valley"" character Russ Hanneman approving of the design.) There are three rows of seats, but the second row holds just two passengers.The X features a windshield that extends above the driver's head, offering panoramic views and the feel of a helicopter cockpit, Musk said.Most importantly, though, Musk said that the Model X is safe.""We've made the safest SUV ever,"" he said. Sensors can automatically apply the brakes or steer away from cars and dangerous objects, he said during the debut, which was webcast from Tesla's Fremont, California, factory. ""There's really nothing that's more important"" than safety.Eyes might be fixed on those back seats, because CEO Elon Musk said in August that they had become a problem during production. Tesla experienced success in the luxury market with the Model S, which was the second-highest selling luxury model last year. With the Model X, Tesla is introducing an electric SUV at least a few years before competitors like Mercedes, Porsche and General Motors crack into the field. For now, Tesla is niche player. It is forecast to sell almost 29,000 cars this year, according to LMC Automotive. Ford, in contrast, is predicted to move almost 2.5 million vehicles. Analysts see the Model X as a step toward somewhat wider appeal. “Tesla wants to be a mainstream automaker,” said Doug Gilman, an industry analyst for Frost & Sullivan. “To be a competitive automaker you have to have a whole host of vehicles. You can’t just have one super.”An SUVs safety and size might attract female drivers with families, analysts said. If the X outsells the S, experts will probably deem the new line a success. “The big potential for the Model X is that it’s going to open up a whole new market that they had to fight a little harder for with the Model S. That’s the female market,” said Karl Brauer, a senior director at Kelley Blue Book. “There’s a huge market out there.”The Fremont factory looked more like a nightclub on Tuesday night as thousands of attendees who had paid at least $5,000 to reserve a Model X sipped wine while listening to remixed versions of hits from Dolly Parton and the Rolling Stones.Though attendees had yet to see the Model X in person, some people said they had faith in Tesla based on the quality of the Model S.""I love my Range Rover, but I can't stand going to the gas station,"" Dana Cappiello, 55, a realtor from San Francisco, told The Huffington Post.""It was as simple as that."" She was peeved by the late start. CEO Elon Musk took the stage in a dark jacket and jeans just before 9 p.m. PST, nearly an hour behind schedule.The audience erupted with laughter as he touted the environmental benefits of his all-electric vehicles while alluding to Volkswagen's ongoing scandal over software that helped its cars outrageously cheat on diesel emissions tests. Volkswagen is the biggest automaker in the world by sales.""We designed this car well before recent events,"" Musk said.Long lines formed for test rides in the factory parking lot after the presentation ended. For the company to become profitable, Tesla needs to increase sales by hundreds of thousands of cars per year, according to John Humphrey, a senior vice president at J.D. Power and Associates. “These customers are evangelical about the brand,” Humphrey said. “Going downmarket and not losing the allure of the brand is the challenge. Each rung you go down, you lose a little shine on it.”Tesla stock was up nearly 2 percent in pre-market trading on Wednesday morning. This story has been updated to include additional comments from analysts.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that the Model X is Tesla's second car. It's actually the second model currently available, because the company had discontinued the Roadster in 2012."
10,POLITICS,You'll Never Guess The Single Greatest Risk Factor For Student Loan Default,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/student-loan-defaults-report_us_5609b381e4b0af3706dd7ddd,"In a new report, 73.1 percent of loans with one servicer ended up in default.",2015-09-29,The Education Department under Secretary Arne Duncan has been widely criticized for its handling of student loans.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5609b6d21900002f00fde9b3.jpeg?cache=O6jI5RELSA&ops=crop_40_237_2937_1677%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Borrowers were at greater risk of defaulting if their student loans were handled by the Department of Education's main loan contractor than if they had dropped out of college or failed to complete a single class, according to a startling new report released Monday.The study from the Association of Community College Trustees provides an unusual look into why some people default on student loans. Using previously confidential data, researchers examined all students who borrowed from the federal government to attend community colleges in Iowa and whose loans came due between October 2010 and September 2011. Nearly 28 percent of those loans ended up in default by January 2015.The report adds to a growing body of evidence that the Education Department is failing to properly police its loan contractors. Serious delinquencies in the largest student loan program are on the rise, while about one-fifth of all student borrowers are in default on their loans -- troubling trends at a time when the economy is growing and unemployment is falling.In response to widespread complaints and its own findings, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is widely expected to announce that it will develop new rules to govern the $1.3 trillion student loan market, including the roughly 90 percent of outstanding loans either owned or backed by the Education Department.Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin appeared to endorse the CFPB's expected efforts during a Monday speech in Indianapolis to nonprofit credit counselors.""Unfortunately, neither private nor federal student loan servicers have ... exactly been wrapping themselves in glory these days,"" Raskin said in prepared remarks. ""Repairing this system before it does further harm to borrowers is a must. This is primarily the responsibility of the servicing industry and the agencies that contract with them.""The Education Department expects to pay its loan servicers $804 million this year, spokeswoman Dorie Nolt said in August.Last year, the department revamped its agreements with loan contractors to pay them more money in a bid to improve how borrowers are treated and to minimize loan defaults. Unlike other consumer debt, federal student loans aren't in default until there have been 270 days, or nine months, of no payments. That lengthy period of time, plus the availability of federal plans that allow monthly payments based on borrowers' earnings, has led some officials to question why borrowers default at all.Yet among the loans examined by the community colleges' report, default was the most likely outcome for those serviced by the Education Department's longtime exclusive loan contractor, ACS Education Solutions.Some of the report's findings confirm widely held beliefs -- that college dropouts are more likely to default than borrowers who earn an educational credential and that dropouts generally borrow little money compared to those who complete their programs. But in a twist, researchers found that the highest rate of default occurred among borrowers whose loans were serviced by ACS Education Solutions, which is now part of Xerox.Some 73.1 percent of the 4,596 borrowers whose loans ACS serviced had defaulted by September 2013, according to the report. Nearly three-quarters of those defaults occurred within the first year that payments were due. (Where a loan was serviced by more than one company, the report credited the default to the last loan servicer on the file.)The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, which is more commonly known as FedLoan Servicing, had the next highest default rate among Education Department contractors at 21.8 percent.The 73.1 percent default rate was the highest cited in the report for any single factor the researchers looked at.Borrowers who made no payments on their loans defaulted at a 45.8 percent clip during the period examined (the other 54.2 percent had probably entered a program that let them delay their payments). Those who didn't earn any educational credential defaulted at a 35.9 percent rate. Even those who failed to earn a single academic credit defaulted at a lower rate -- 58 percent -- than ACS borrowers.Kevin Lightfoot, a spokesman for Xerox, said the ACS default rate in the community colleges report wasn't indicative of the company’s overall performance. He noted that the loans examined represented only a small portion of the company's loan portfolio. In addition, he said, because the Education Department was transferring loans from ACS to other companies during the period studied, its default rate may not represent the full population of borrowers it serviced.""We followed [Federal Student Aid division] guidance and policies regarding loan default,"" Lightfoot said.The Education Department's contract with ACS ended in July 2014 and all of the company's loans had been transferred by the end of August 2013, according to Nolt, the department spokeswoman. ACS's default rate in the report may be elevated because of the way the department transferred loans to other contractors, Nolt added. Delinquent loans were the last to be transferred, she said, meaning that ACS was servicing a riskier population than its peers.""We don't know for certain because we haven't had time to dig into the data fully,"" Nolt said. The Association of Community College Trustees had previously briefed the Education Department on its findings.The department paid ACS nearly $1.4 billion under its contract during the fiscal years 2008 to 2014, federal records show. The contract was once valued at potentially more than $2 billion.Xerox's chairman and chief executive, Ursula Burns, is a close adviser to President Barack Obama. Burns is a member of Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness and chairs his Export Council, which gives him advice about policy and programs that affect trade.The Education Department's inspector general criticized the department in August 2015 for failing to hold ACS accountable for some of its allegedly shoddy work. Two years earlier, the inspector general had determined that the department failed to properly monitor loan servicers' compliance with their contracts.Nolt didn't make available for interviews the two department officials who oversee the student loan program: Ted Mitchell, undersecretary of education, and James Runcie, chief operating officer of the Federal Student Aid division.Last year, the Education Department spared some colleges from sanctions linked to their former students' high loan default rates by excusing defaults that may have occurred due to questionable servicing practices. Nolt said the department would not similarly spare ACS borrowers from some of the punishing effects of a student loan default, such as ruined credit reports or, in some states, loss of occupational licenses."
11,ENTERTAINMENT,Donald Trump's Tax Plan Could Balloon The Debt By 75 Percent,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-tax-plan_us_560ac15ce4b0af3706de0539,"Make favorable growth projections, and the results are still insane.",2015-09-29,"Of course, Trump swears his proposal wouldn't ""add to our debt.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560ac3551800005200831342.jpeg?cache=RJ9mBL1hzV&ops=crop_53_122_3901_2370%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump's tax plan would increase the national debt by more than 75 percent over the next decade, according to an analysis by a conservative think tank. Trump claims on his website that his plan ""doesn't add to our debt."" But the businessman-birther, who believes wrongly that vaccines cause autism, should at least recognize when numbers don't add up.The plan, introduced on Monday, promises massive benefits for wealthy Americans. Trump would reduce the top income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent, slash the tax rate for the largest corporations from 35 percent to 15 percent, lower the tax rate on stock and bond profits, and entirely eliminate the estate tax. That last tax applies only to the estates of dead millionaires, while securities earnings overwhelmingly flow to the very richest households.As a result, the Tax Foundation found that Trump's plan would boost the incomes of the top 1 percent of taxpayers by 21.8 percent, while those of the lowest-income Americans would rise by only 1.4 percent. The national debt, meanwhile, would jump by $12 trillion over the next decade.The Tax Foundation, which has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Koch brothers, presented another set of calculations based on favorable assumptions of economic growth that it said would be driven by Trump's policies. Under that scenario, the national debt would climb by just $10.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Under that more favorable scenario, the Tax Foundation concluded that the lowest-income households would see their incomes rise by 10.7 percent, while incomes for the top 1 percent would rise by 27 percent.The total federal debt held by the public is currently $13.08 trillion.Trump's campaign has said his tax plan will make up for the massive drop in federal revenue due to all the tax cuts by also closing loopholes. But that is just not mathematically possible. Fellow GOP presidential hopeful Jeb Bush has also pitched a tax platform featuring huge financial benefits for the rich. The Tax Foundation found that the Bush plan would cost federal coffers $3.66 trillion over the next decade -- or $1.6 trillion under its more forgiving projection assuming certain economic growth. Jeb Bush would cut income tax rates for the very richest to 28 percent and reduce tax rates on the biggest corporations to 20 percent -- levels far below those implemented by his brother, then-President George W. Bush."

The Wisconsin parents wanted to include shadows that would represent the two baby boys they lost four years ago.Photographer Linda Gittins helped bring their vision to life with this inspiring image.During her first pregnancy in 2011, Patten went into preterm labor at 23 weeks, and doctors were unable stop the progression. She delivered her twin boys -- Aiden and Gavin -- two days apart and lost them shortly after.""It felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest. We tried for a year to get pregnant, and then they were taken away from us,"" the mom told The Huffington Post. ""I was in a really dark place after losing them."" Though joining a support group and doing things to remember the babies helped her get through the grieving process, Patten said all future pregnancies ""were ruined"" for her as she was overwhelmed with fear and anxiety.Four years after the loss, Patten is the mother of two healthy little girls, 3-year-old Ava and 13-month-old Giuliana.

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has a new plan to repeal parts of Obamacare.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5609669b1900002f00fde8ab.jpeg?cache=gBLDqkO06M&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Planned Parenthood and Obamacare are probably the two things the GOP hates most. House Republicans are targeting both this week with an obscure procedural move that could finally advance opposition bills to President Barack Obama's desk.The procedure is called budget reconciliation, and legislation advanced that way cannot be filibustered in the Senate, is subject only to limited amendments and needs only simple majority votes to pass, according to House and Senate rules. It would then be up to Obama to veto the measures, which he would be all but certain to do. But the process would move two cherished GOP goals through the Senate, pushing them further than they've ever gotten before.“Obamacare remains as unpopular as ever, and this package gives us our best shot to put a repeal bill on the president’s desk,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who is leading the Obamacare attack and rolled out his plans Monday. Congress set up the moves last spring when it passed a budget plan that included reconciliation provisions -- essentially instructions for various committees to draw up legislation targeting the Affordable Care Act and other unspecified issues. Senate committees are expected to take similar steps to those in the House.Ryan's legislation targets the ACA by ordering the repeal of several key parts of the law, including the mandate for people to purchase health care, the cost-controlling Independent Payment Advisory Board, a tax on medical devices, and the so-called ""Cadillac plan"" tax on high-cost health insurance.The legislation cannot target all of the Affordable Care Act because reconciliation bills must be focused on taxes, spending or the debt limit, not on policy. But according to the Ways and Means Committee's assessment, ""the repeal of these provisions would be a devastating blow to Obamacare.""The Energy and Commerce Committee and the Committee on Education and the Workforce are preparing legislation this week to repeal other parts of Obamacare.It is the Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), that is drawing up the bill to defund Planned Parenthood.""We also will take steps to protect taxpayer dollars from programs and organizations that do not live up to the standards and priorities of the American people,"" Upton said in a statement announcing his plans. ""As this committee continues to investigate Planned Parenthood and its affiliates, the flow of taxpayer dollars should end.""Republicans have ratcheted up their efforts against Planned Parenthood ever since the emergence of heavily edited sting videos that purport to show the health care provider scheming to profit from selling fetus parts. That claim has been debunked, but lawmakers have seized upon it, even trying to link it to funding for the federal government.Democrats saw the moves as yet another waste of time, and charged that GOP leaders were simply trying to appease their right-wing members in hopes of keeping them in line to pass a bill to keep the government funded this week. Hardline conservatives had been spoiling for leaders to use that funding bill as a vehicle to defund Planned Parenthood, thereby sparking a shutdown fight that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) wants to avoid.“These reconciliation bills aren’t about legislating – they’re about appealing to recalcitrant Republicans to try to win votes for a clean Continuing Resolution [funding bill],"" said the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, Rep, Sander Levin (Mich.) in a statement. ""The bills before Ways and Means, which amount to the 61st vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, won’t become law. Republicans are so worried about fixing the growing divisions in their own party that they’re failing to govern.”Obama could be forced to uncap his veto pen as soon as October.

The California Republican is running to replace current Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who will resign from the post and his seat in Congress effective Oct. 30.McCarthy made his decision public just three days after Boehner told the House Republican Conference, which has been rife with turmoil over the past year, that he would resign to prevent further division among its members.""I am running to be your Speaker because I know that the People’s House works best when the leadership you elect listens to members and respects the legislative process entrusted to committees,"" McCarthy said in an email to the conference in which he announced his candidacy. McCarthy will need to prove quickly that he is different from Boehner, if he wants to keep the conservative members on his side. The House Freedom Caucus, which consists of over 40 conservative members, played a key role in the momentum leading to Boehner’s resignation. It wanted Boehner to be more aggressive and force through legislation its members support, including a government-funding measure that would have defunded Planned Parenthood and led to a government shutdown after being vetoed by the president.In his email to members, McCarthy touched on the elephant in the room, saying the caucus “must heal the divisions in our conference with work, time, and trust.”More conservative members argued constituents back home have been angry with Boehner for not taking a stronger stance on core conservative issues. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have defended their tactics, countering that they share the same policy positions with their most conservative members but won’t engage in futile exercises that will cause a government shutdown or yield veto after veto with no endgame for success.Attempting to distance himself from Boehner, McCarthy said he wants the public to “once again feel like this is their government.”In a possible signal that he plans to include the more conservative members in his inner circle, McCarthy promised, if elected speaker, he’d “have the courage to lead the fight for our conservative principles and make our case to the American people.”In his pitch, McCarthy tried to strike a human tone, reminding members, “You all know me. We’ve spent late nights on the House floor together.”Over the weekend, McCarthy stayed in Washington, D.C., to call every House Republican to gauge their support, as well as listen to their concerns and advice.He is expected to easily win the speakership.So far, only one other member has announced a run for the post. Over the weekend, Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), a member of the conservative faction, said he would run for speaker. Webster could make it more difficult for McCarthy to garner the 218 needed to win the spot if he woos the House Freedom Caucus.Members of the conservative caucus said on Sunday that they will hold one-on-one meetings with people running for speaker and other leadership posts that could become open during the shuffle.“We look forward to meeting with each of the candidates and our Republican Conference colleagues over the coming weeks in a careful and deliberative fashion to discuss how best to ensure that we follow regular order in the House and give a voice to the countless Americans who still feel that Washington does not represent them,"" the House Freedom Caucus said in a statement.This post has been updated with more details about the challenges for the next speaker.Also on HuffPost:"

Those who covered this up are guilty. Even some bishops who covered this up, it is a terrible thing,” the pope said, quoted by Vatican Radio.Francis criticized those who attempted to comfort victims by saying, “Don’t worry that was nothing,” and said abusers who were unrepentant would be judged by God.“If a person has done wrong, is conscious of what he has done and does not say sorry, I ask God to take him into account,” the pope said. “I forgive him, but he does not receive that forgiveness, he is closed to forgiveness.”The pontiff urged people to forgive others, although he said he understood that some victims of clerical sexual abuse and their relatives would not be able to do so. Referring to a victim whose mother lost her faith on learning her daughter had been sexually abused by a cleric, the pope said he understood such a reaction.“Because what was abused, destroyed, was her own flesh, the flesh of her daughter. I understand her. I don’t judge someone who can’t forgive. I pray and I ask God,” the pope said.Francis met with five people on Sunday who had been sexually abused as children, saying he was “deeply sorry” that their experiences were not heard or believed when they spoke out about the abuse.“Clergy and bishops will be held accountable when they abuse or fail to protect children,” the pontiff told the abuse survivors, ahead of a meeting with bishops in which he said “God weeps” over clerical abuse.On the flight back to Rome, the pope was asked if he supported individuals, including government officials, who refuse to abide by some laws, such as issuing marriage licenses to gays.“Conscientious objection must enter into every juridical structure because it is a right,” Francis said, as reported by Reuters.Earlier this month a county clerk in Kentucky, Kim Davis, went to jail because she refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples following a Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage.But it was unclear whether the pope had that case in mind.“I can’t have in mind all cases that can exist about conscientious objection but, yes, I can say that conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right,” he said, speaking in Italian.“And if someone does not allow others to be a conscientious objector, he denies a right,” he added.Francis said conscientious objection had to be respected in legal structures. “Otherwise we would end up in a situation where we select what is a right, saying: ‘This right has merit, this one does not.’”(Reuters contributed to this report.)Also on HuffPost:"
