CLINICAL DEFINITIONIts clinical guidance to 194 member states said health care workers should be alert to anyone with acute respiratory syndrome that may include fever (above 38°C or 100.4°F) and cough, requiring hospitalisation, who had been in the area where the virus was found or in contact with a suspect or confirmed case within the previous 10 days.The virus, known as a coronavirus also related to the common cold, comes from the same family as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) which emerged in China in 2002. SARS infected 8,000 people worldwide and killed 800 of them before being brought under control.The WHO said it was identifying a network of laboratories that could provide expertise on coronaviruses to countries.""Though it is a very different virus from SARS, given the severity of the two confirmed cases so far, WHO is engaged in further characterizing the novel coronavirus,"" it said, referring to genetic sequencing.Hartl, speaking to reporters on Tuesday, said: ""This is not SARS, it will not become SARS, it is not SARS-like.""It was not established whether the virus spread by human to human contact or just how it was transmitted, he said.""We don't know if all cases of infections are as severe as the two cases we have currently or in fact whether there have been 2 million cases of this virus and only 2 severe cases.""(Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Janet Lawrence)"

He was 84. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c57cd2200005600d932c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Moon River"" singer Andy Williams has died at 84 from bladder cancer, according to news reports.USA Today reported that Williams had been battling bladder cancer for a year, and his family requests that people wishing to send flowers instead make donations to the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network. Bladder cancer risk rises as people age, and is also more common among men and white people, according to the Mayo Clinic. In most cases of bladder cancer, the cancer arises in the cells that make up the bladder's inner lining (called transitional cell carcinomas), though other kinds of bladder cancer include cancer in the thin, flat cells of the bladder (called squamous cell carcinoma) and cancer in the fluid- and mucus-releasing cells in the bladder (called adenocarcinoma), according to the National Cancer Institute. Symptoms of bladder cancer include problems with urinating -- blood in the urine, pain while urinating, and having to urinate more than usual -- as well as pain in the back and pelvic area, according to the Mayo Clinic. While the exact cause of all bladder cancers is unknown, there are some significant risk factors for the disease. Smoking is a big one -- it's responsible for as many as half of all bladder cancer cases in men, according to the A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia. Other known risk factors include being exposed to certain carcinogenic chemicals at work (people who work in rubber, dye, aluminum and truck-driving fields may have a higher risk than others), having taken the chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide, having had radiation treatments for cervical cancer in the past, and bladder infection in some cases, the A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia reported. Like many other cancers, bladder cancer is deadlier if it is in a higher stage and has spread to other parts of the body (the severity of the cancer is defined by stages). For example, stage 0 bladder cancer has a 98 percent survival rate over five years, but stage 3 bladder cancer has a 46 percent five-year survival rate and stage 4 bladder cancer has a 15 percent five-year survival rate, according to the American Cancer Society. This year, there are expected to be 14,880 deaths from bladder cancer, and 73,510 new cases of the disease, the National Cancer Institute reported. "

Other states with large number of cases include Mississippi, Michigan, South Dakota, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and California.A total of 147 people have died from the disease, compared with 134 reported one week ago. Just over half of the cases reported to the CDC this year have been of the severe neuroinvasive form of the disease, which can lead to meningitis and encephalitis.The milder form of the disease causes flu-like symptoms and is rarely lethal.Experts believe the disease originated in Africa and was first detected in New York City in 1999. Outbreaks tend to be unpredictable. Hot temperatures, rainfall amounts and ecological factors such as bird and mosquito populations have to align just right to trigger an outbreak such as the one this year.The CDC said the number of cases this year is the highest reported to federal health officials through the last week in September since 2003, the year with the most cases.

5,WELLNESS,Healthier School Meals Despite Agribiz Lobbying,"Michael F. Jacobson, Contributor
Executive Director, Center for Science in the Public Interest",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/healthy-hunger-free-kids-act_us_5b9c566be4b03a1dcc7de2ea,"Back to school can be a time of adjustment.  Just as students might need time to adjust to new teachers and subjects, the school lunch program might need time before it is fully accepted by students or financially successful.",2012-09-26,File photo dated 28/08/09 of a school dinner being served as a funding anomaly which has left tens of thousands of poor teenagers missing out on free lunches is to be debated by MPs.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c566b240000510094a296.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The new, healthier school meals being served to America's school-aged children are filled with more (and more varied) vegetables, fruit, and whole grains, and less salt, saturated fat, and trans fat. The standards set calorie maximums for the first time and lower calorie minimums to better ensure that school meals address obesity, as well as hunger. That's unambiguously good news for kids, but these meals represent something else: a rare victory over special interests.To be sure, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act -- the law that reauthorized the child nutrition programs -- didn't emerge entirely unscathed. The surprisingly influential frozen pizza industry won language from Congress qualifying pizza (with tomato sauce) as a vegetable, and French fry manufacturers and potato farmers fought off proposed curbs on how often fries could be offered. But otherwise, in a town where lobbyists for dairy, beef, pork, sugar, salt, and other food industry sectors usually get their way, it's a minor miracle that the new lunches being served around the country are as wholesome, attractive, and tasty as they are.The National School Lunch Program provides meals to 31 million children each day, accounting for a third of many students' daily calorie intakes. With one out of every three children in America overweight or obese and 15 years since the last update of the program, it was time for a change. Ensuring that school meals are healthy and in line with current nutrition is not only important for kids' health, but also for academics. Healthy kids learn better. Research shows that kindergartners who do not have reliable, healthy meals are noticeably behind their peers in reading and math by the third grade.School cafeteria managers are working hard to implement the new standards, but this is a tough job. They need the support of parents, teachers, administrators, food manufacturers, and others in order to overcome a number of challenges. Even the healthiest foods are only healthy if they are actually eaten, and let's face it, kids have become all too accustomed to junk food. We'll have to work against the $2 billion a year that is spent on marketing unhealthy products to kids.Fortunately, it's possible to get most kids to eat fruits and veggies. Schools have engaged students with taste tests, fun facts about new fruits and vegetables, or student votes on their favorite options. Parents can help by reinforcing healthy eating at home and encouraging their children to try the new menu options. Teachers can try the new school lunches and speak supportively about them with students. School administrators can support the program by showing leadership and support for the programs and help ensure the new standards are fully implemented. State child nutrition programs need to continue to support school efforts and provide ideas for menus and recipes. And companies need to produce products with more whole grains and less salt, so schools have a wider variety of healthy options.Back to school can be a time of adjustment. Just as students might need time to adjust to new teachers and subjects, the school lunch program might need time before it is fully accepted by students or financially successful. And of course, we still need to be vigilant to fend off any new industry efforts to sneak junk foods back into the school lunch program. Iowa Congressman Steve King, for instance -- never before seen as much of an anti-hunger crusader -- is sponsoring legislation that would repeal the sensible caps on calories on school meals. Hard to see how anyone thinks that 850 calories is not enough for most high schoolers. Or perhaps some well-heeled food manufacturer wants to sell more of its product to the government, regardless of nutrition.The National Academies' Institute of Medicine identified appropriate amounts of calories to meet most children's energy needs. Student athletes who may need more food throughout the day could take advantage of after-school snack or after-school supper programs or could purchase additional a la carte items to supplement their school lunch. Not all students are linebackers, and we shouldn't feed them like they are.Numerous members of Congress stood up for children and stood up to food manufacturers, and countless fed-up parents urged them along. First Lady Michelle Obama also played a valuable leadership role as a champion of healthy eating and children.

A red dress is like a beacon of light in the dark night of style. Whenever we spot an actress on the red carpet in a scarlet frock, our first reaction is to put her on the best-dressed list. Not only is it a bold choice that stands out in a sea of black dresses, but it's also a hue that is flattering on just about everyone. We like to think of a LRD as every gal's secret weapon in her wardrobe arsenal. A few things to keep in mind when going crimson: For work, make sure that the neckline isn't too revealing and that the hemline is appropriate. Tone it down with a fitted jacket and black pumps. If you are wearing it out at night, don't go overboard: the rich color doesn't need much else. Simple jewelry and strappy heels will do the trick. Come winter, wear your favorite neutral-colored sweater over it and people will think you got a new skirt. Bonus: Add a dickey for a fun detail.Here, 11 stars in red dresses, plus a few shoppable options. Want more? Be sure to check out Stylelist on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Pinterest."
