1,DIVORCE,How To Tell Your Children About Divorce In Ten Steps,"Natalie Gregg, Contributor
Divorce Lawyer, Entrepreneur, Mother of Two",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-tell-your-children_us_5b9c279ce4b03a1dcc7cb051,There are few harder moments in parenthood than telling your kids that it's over between mommy and daddy.,2012-08-23,"Teenage girl at the counselor's office, listening to her mother criticize her clothing choices.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c279c24000050005317e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are few harder moments in parenthood than telling your kids that it's over between mommy and daddy. As a divorce attorney, I have seen hundreds of families struggle over how to break this news to their children. The process should involve calculated timing by the parents, a scripted statement explaining why it happened and a sketch of what is going to happen to the family in the future. There is no use trying to avoid the issue: this part of the process is far worse than when you told your spouse that you wanted a divorce, mostly because the recipient of this pain is a child.I would caution divorcing parents to be very careful about how they talk to their children about the ""D"" word. You might be sick and tired of your spouse, but you need to remember that you will be co-parents after the divorce. There will be dance recitals, football games, graduations and even marriages to attend. For the sake of your children, work together to share the news of your divorce with them.You could do irreparable damage to your children if you break the news to them without your spouse by your side. I have seen many couples attempt to use ""the announcement"" as a way to shift blame onto the other party. This often backfires, and many times traumatizes the children unnecessarily. The way that a message is packaged sets the trajectory for how that message is received. Think before you speak. Remember your audience. Don't use adult words or a message of blame or abandonment. Remember these simple tenants prior to blurting out, ""your Dad is leaving Mom and is going to live with his f***ing girlfriend"" or, ""Mom doesn't love you enough to try to make this marriage work."" The following ten items outline a course for telling the kids in the least painful way possible.Before you break the news...1. Consult a child or family therapist together with your soon-to-be-ex to process the messaging.2. Work together to write a script for the conversation with your child(ren).3. Pick a time and place that is safe and that does not involve friends or relatives. Avoid conflict with important dates or deadlines i.e., child's birthday or right before a big test.During your discussion...4. In your discussion, focus on the positives -- that the child has two people who love her so much that they both want special time with her.5. Focus on how things at home are going to stay as similar as possible.6. Tell the child that it is not their fault -- that mommy and daddy are just their best selves in two different houses, and that this will be the best way for them to do the best job loving her.7. Do not blame. Make it appear as a joint decision.8. Expect tears. You are not being mean; you are not kicking a puppy. Rather, you are being honest -- and honesty can hurt.After the discussion...9. Expect more questions after your initial announcement. Answer them honestly but be mindful of the advice above (especially number 6 and number 7).10. Avoid creating a sense of abandonment. If at all possible, try staying in the same home as your spouse on the night or day that you tell your child. Additionally, try scheduling a family dinner with the children and the other spouse at the new place once they have settled in. Above all, put your child first.Remember: you can love your kids or hate your spouse... but you cannot do both."

Britain was initially announced as the silver medalist but Japan questioned the score of three-time world champion Kohei Uchimura on pommel horse, the team's very last routine. About five minutes later, Uchimura's score was revised and Japan was awarded the silver while Britain was bumped down to bronze.

The 66-year-old widow placed the £5 bet (about $8) in honor of her late husband Eric, a man who ""loved a bet,"" according to the local Thanet Times. No British gymnastic team has won a medal in artistic gymnastics in exactly 100 years, and the odds were 200-1 that the hometown boys would be able to break that streak and deliver during the games.But Oldham did win. In fact, the 19-year-old went on to make history, as the squad from Great Britain thrilled the home crowd with a bronze-medal performance in the team competition. But when Aldred returned to the Betfred shop to claim her £1,000 (about $1,600) purse, the bookmaker refused to pay out. The shop claimed the bet was void because Oldham had medaled as part of a team and not on his own.Upon inspection, the winning betting slip seems to support Aldred's case, however. The wager seems to specify only that Oldham win a medal--any medal--and does not differentiate between team and individual events, Yahoo! notes.Aldred has since taken the dispute to the The Independent Betting Adjudication Service, according to The Telegraph. A spokesman for IBAS told the paper that while they could not comment on individual cases, they had been handling a number of Olympic-related bets, which would ""be dealt with through the normal procedures.""USA Today reports that it is not uncommon for British oddsmakers to take creative futures bets with long odds.Either way, Aldred said she was very proud of her Olympian grandson. ""It is more the principle than the money,"" she told the Thanet Times. ""I could have used the winnings to pay for my ticket to see Sam at the 2016 Olympics in Rio."""

Triumph vs. Madonna's ""Material Girl"" Clothing Line",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2c982000004e00fd77fd.png?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"We tend to glaze over when reading legal jargon, but today's news brings a legal debate that's piqued our interest. Lululemon, purveyor of expensive yoga pants for taut mommies everywhere, is suing Calvin Klein over their ""Astro"" pants. But the lawsuit doesn't center on a stolen logo or brand name, as many fashion-on-fashion suits do; instead, Lululemon is accusing Calvin Klein of patent infringement. Lululemon claims Calvin Klein ripped off (so to speak) the ""Astro"" waistband as well as two other design elements.Patents are a rare thing in fashion, Fashionista notes, as most patents are utility patents, referring to the function of an invention. Yet design patents refer to the ""ornamental aspects of an invention,"" a distinction that can be hard to pin down. As Susan Scafidi, academic director of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University Law School, told the Vancouver Sun: ""Take the average polo shirt, for example. The design isn’t new, so it can’t be patented — novelty being the most basic requirement of patentability — but it’s easy to stitch a logo over the heart and gain instant legal protection, at least for that little crocodile, polo pony, or other trademark."" Thus we see trademark lawsuits all the time (for example, Gucci's court battle against Guess). Design patent court battles? Not so much.Design patents are hard to obtain in the first place, notes lawyer Adrian Pruetz. ""It's very hard to come up with something that's new and that hasn't just been part of the clothing vernacular,"" Pruetz told the Chicago Tribune, and then it can be hard to protect those designs. But pursuing design patents can be worth it, Scafidi pointed out to Fashionista, if the design element will be used again and again in multiple collections. Lululemon filed its suit against Calvin Klein and their manufacturer, G-III Apparel, last week in Delaware. Stay tuned to see the outcome... fingers crossed for a highly entertaining, multi-day court battle a la Gucci vs. Guess.

The K-12th grade public charter school is the first in Idaho to advertise itself as a patriotic choice for parents, with an emphasis on individual freedoms and free-market capitalism. (AP Photo/Jessie L.

At Kidville, we offer Kidville University, a preschool alternative program, which many parents select in order to transition their child into preschool and separate for the first time. Here are a few tips that we have found to be effective in easing this separation process:1. Have an open dialogue with your child.  Most children do better if they are not surprised by what is about to happen. Talk to your child about the fact that you will be leaving and what that will mean for them. Remind your child of your separation routine and reinforce that even though you will be separated, ""mommy always comes back."" Positive reinforcement goes a long way!2. Establish a goodbye routine and stick with it. Get creative in the routine that will distract, soothe, and prepare your child for the separation process. This routine could include playing their favorite song on the way to school or doing the same high five and hug right before you leave. Whatever routine you select, remain consistent, particularly for the first couple of weeks, including having the same parent or caregiver drop your child to school.3. Don't leave without saying goodbye.  It is tempting to slip out while your child is distracted; however, this ""quick fix"" will only hinder the separation process. By sneaking out you are breaking your child's trust, which will most likely lead to them becoming more clingy and anxious the next time you separate. Instead, find an activity in the classroom that you know your child enjoys or bring their favorite toy or distraction from home. Advise the teacher to participate in this activity both before and immediately after you say goodbye to help distract your child.4. Leave when you say you are going to leave and keep your goodbye short. This may be difficult if your child is upset, but prolonging the goodbye will only make it more difficult when you do actually leave. If you re-enter the room after you have said you are going to leave, it gives your child incentive to cry harder the next time you separate. And, keep your goodbye short and sweet -- dragging out the goodbye only makes it more difficult for you and your child.5. Tell your child when you will return. In Kidville University, we advise parents to remind their children that ""mommy always comes back after gym."" This gives the child something to look forward to and provides a signal that the end of school and return of mommy are near. Another effective strategy is to teach children how to read a clock. Looking at the clock and knowing that mommy comes back when the clock hands are on the 11 and the 6 often calms anxious children -- and it is a great way to introduce the concept of time!"
