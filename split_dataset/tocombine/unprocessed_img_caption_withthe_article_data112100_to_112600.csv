Chapman was sentenced to 20 years to life in 1981 after pleading guilty to second-degree murder. On Friday, Aug. 22, a three-person Parole Board panel denied the inmates request for release. The panel decision came from a concern that Chapman would commit more crimes and that his release would be ""incompatible with the welfare of society,"" according to the decision.Chapman was last denied parole in 2012 even though the panel acknowledged his good conduct in prison. The board found that at the time his release would ""trivialize the tragic loss of life which [he] caused."" Now 59, Chapman won't be eligible for parole for another two years.[via Daily News]"

There are three black people on the grand jury, one man and two women. The rest of the jury comprises six white men and three white women. The demographics of the jury roughly coincide with the racial makeup of St. Louis County itself, which is 68 percent white and 24 percent black. But race has already played a major role in this case, as it has garnered international attention and sparked conversation about racial discrimination and inequality prompting demonstrators to protest nationwide.According to the Missouri attorney general's office, the grand jury will decide whether a crime has been committed and ""whether there is probable cause to believe the defendant committed it.‚Äù If the jury makes that decision, it can issue an indictment formally charging the defendant. Police said Brown was shot multiple times on Aug. 9 after being confronted by a white officer. Authorities initially offered vague details about the confrontation but said the officer involved had been placed on administrative leave. The FBI opened an investigation into Brown's death last week."

Moreover, the cake batter that tops the ambrosial peaches gives just the right amount of structure to the dessert while remaining light and moist.A dollop of vanilla Chantilly is the only thing you need to accompany such a gorgeous cake. Happy baking and happy summer!Wine pairing A dessert wine, brimming with stone fruit flavors, is sublime here! Try a Sauternes from Bordeaux or a Riesling Ice Wine from Canada or Germany. Both of these wines have wonderful stone fruit notes that pair well with the peaches, and while they're both fairly sweet, their inherent acidity will prevent them from being too cloying. Make sure to serve these dessert wines chilled.Peach upside-down cake with Cognac caramelmakes 1 medium cake or serves 6 to 8 active time: 45 minFor the Chantilly 2/3 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons organic sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extractFor the peaches 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 medium ripe-but-firm yellow peaches (2 lbs) (905 g) - quartered and pit removed (if using larger peaches, cut in 2"" slices) 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons organic sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 tablespoons Cognac or brandyFor the batter 1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder pinch sea salt 4 extra large eggs - at room temperature, separated 1 extra large egg white - at room temperature 3/4 cup organic sugar 4 oz (115 g) unsalted butter (8 tablespoons) - at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 - 9"" round cake pan - lightly buttered, lined with wax paper and buttered againPreheat oven to 350¬∞F (180¬∞C).Step 1: To make the Chantilly - Place the heavy cream, sugar and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer and whip at medium speed until thick and ribbony. Refrigerate until ready to use.Step 2: Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the butter. Once melted, add the peach slices, laying them on their side, and saut√© for 3 to 4 minutes until golden. Sprinkle the peach slices with 2 tablespoons of sugar and flip them, being careful not to break them. Continue to saut√© for 2 to 3 minutes until golden-brown. Remove pan from heat and arrange the peach slices in a daisy pattern in the prepared mold, making sure to fit the slices tightly together. Set aside. Return the pan to the stove over medium/medium-high heat. Add the balance of the sugar, vanilla and Cognac and simmer, stirring continuously until a rich caramel forms (about 5 to 6 minutes). Immediately drizzle the caramel evenly over the peaches and set aside.Step 3: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.Step 4: Place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer and whip at medium speed until frothy. Increase to high speed and gradually add 1/4 cup sugar. Continue to whip at high speed until firm peaks form, about 1 to 2 minutes.Step 5: Place the soft butter, the balance of the sugar and the vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer and whip at slow speed until creamy. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, and continue whipping at medium speed until well incorporated and thick, about 1 minute. Add a third of the egg whites to the butter/egg yolk mixture and fold until well incorporated. Then add half the flour and carefully fold it in. Repeat again and fold until the egg whites and flour have been just incorporated. Finish by adding the balance of the egg whites and fold them in until just incorporated. Do not overmix. Spoon batter over the peaches, 1/4"" from the edge. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes until golden and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool for at least 1 hour before un-molding, or keep in the mold until ready to serve. Invert the cake onto a serving platter and gently lift off the wax paper. Dust with the powdered sugar and serve each slice with a dollop of the Chantilly.Cook's note: The cake can be made up to 12 hours ahead and kept at room temperature, in a cool place."

8,TASTE,Don't Buy Another Bottle Of Vodka Until You've Read This Article First,"AskMen.com, ContributorThe world's largest men's lifestyle site, dedicated to helping...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dont-buy-another-bottle-o_b_5701343.html,Now we're in something of a third wave of high-quality vodkas.,2014-08-22,2014-08-22-mk5jilffcji4hvqp9fc7e5a2e5vcpn6ruqohcmqi_9e1.jpeg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-22-mk5jilffcji4hvqp9fc7e5a2e5vcpn6ruqohcmqi_9e1-thumb.jpeg,"This article was written by Robert Haynes-Peterson and was originally published on AskMen.Way back at the turn of the century, when premium vodka really became a thing, the emphasis was on smoothness and, honestly, unobtrusiveness (think Absolut in the '80s, then Belvedere, Grey Goose and Ketel One). They blended well in cocktails, had no strong flavors and were as notable for their bottle designs and status-themed price points as their drinkability. The next wave, starting in the past decade, saw vodkas emphasizing their core ingredients and a concept that vodka could boast character and flavor notes (think Tito's, Karlsson's and Purity). Now we're in something of a third wave of high-quality vodkas, it seems: vodkas that reflect the influence of specific waters and even the influence of a sense of place, or ""terroir."" The concept of terroir is one borrowed from the world of fine wines. The idea is that a multitude of natural and cultural elements, from the soil, wind, water, slope, and sunlight to the personal eccentricities of the winemaker translate into the actual flavor and experience of a wine, as much as the specific grape type used. The spirits industry has recently toyed with co-opting the concept, most notably for place-specific libations like mezcal and Cognac, where legal requirements and cultural tradition dictate where and how the product is made. Del Maguey Single Village mezcals, for example, specifically explore the different cooking styles and species of agave plants used by small producers throughout eastern Mexico. As founder Ron Cooper notes, the approach allows mezcal fans to experience the ""distinct character and purity from village to village.""But vodka? C'mon. It's distilled at a very high proof. By definition, in the U.S., it's supposed to be colorless and without a distinctive flavor of the base sugar/starch. And... and... it's vodka! The stuff craft cocktail bartenders scoffed at for years (it has gained renewed respect among many vested and bearded mixologists of late, as witnessed at this year's Tales of the Cocktail). We put some soda or vermouth in there, and we're done with it, right? At least a few producers think it's worth highlighting what their location, ingredients and skills can do in a bottle. Leaf Vodka, which launched last year, focuses on its water, what marketing director Julius Criscione calls its ""most distinguishing characteristic."" Because vodka has to be brought down from a very high proof to drinkable levels, there's a lot of water added after distillation (like, more than half the bottle). For most vodkas, this ""ingredient"" is essentially local tap water that's undergone dechlorification and reverse osmosis, rendering it as generic as the stuff in the white plastic jug at the grocery store.That's not all... click to find out more about vodka terroirs."

As the youngest of their eight grandchildren, I knew them as Grandma Long, who still spoke with the strong accent of her native France, and Grandpa Long, who moved with extreme difficulty because rheumatoid arthritis had attacked his spine.I could not see until many years later and after the death of my grandfather that theirs was truly a love story; two people brought together during the Great War, whose devotion to each other never wavered during months of separation and uncertainty, and then 50 years together.It started with a chance meeting: Richard Donohue Long, a tall, good-looking American soldier from Syracuse, New York, walked down a village street in France, just as Leone Sicre threw open a pair of wooden shutters to shake out a duvet cover. He ducked; she slammed the shutters closed. After the war, Dick wanted to marry Leone, but she refused to be a war bride like so many girls in her village who seemed to be going off with soldiers they barely knew. So Leone sent Dick home to think about it, not fully comprehending the distance between France and New York State. For six months he wrote and despaired when he never got a reply (his letters were intercepted by one of Leone's sisters for reasons that were never quite clear). In the one letter that finally reached her, Dick said he would stop writing and accept her silence as final rejection. She quickly wrote back and agreed to marry him, but only if they could live in France.Dick and Leone married in 1920, and lived in Paris for two years, before moving to the U.S. with their baby daughter because Dick's mother claimed to be dying -- until she threw open the front door to welcome him home, with a frosty reception for his foreign bride. When they needed a home of their own, Dick bought the first farm he could find in a remote, rural area of northern New York State.  For Leone, it was a long way from France, and her many brothers and sisters, the parents she never saw again, and life in a bustling village. Instead, she learned to milk a cow, churn butter and tend crops. By the time the Depression hit, Dick and Leone had three little girls; my mother was the middle child. In the leanest Depression years, the farm put food on the table, but there was no money; soon, the bank threatened foreclosure. Come December all appeared lost, but Leone had a plan: She cut willow branches, shaped them into circles, and wrapped them with ground pine. Sitting up all night, she made wreaths until her hands cracked and bled. Early in the morning, she packed the wreaths into a hamper basket fitted with leather shoulder straps. With that basket on his back, Dick caught the milk train to Syracuse, where he walked door to door, selling wreaths right up until Christmas. Week after week, they finally made enough to pay the interest on the mortgage, with exactly one dime left over, which Dick spent to buy Leone a powder puff. After the Depression, Dick got a job as a state highway foreman, and the couple moved to Oswego, New York, living a few miles from the city limits. Their last home was an old farmhouse heated by a coal stove in the kitchen. I can still picture Grandpa sitting at the table with his sketchpad as he drew landscapes, deer and birds from memory, a postcard, or a photo in a magazine, and Grandma bringing him a cup of coffee and telling him his latest picture was her favorite. He called her ""Cherie,"" and their private conversations were always in French. Even we grandchildren could see they were each other's first priority. When my grandfather died in 1970, sadly on my grandmother's birthday, they were no longer the tall, handsome American soldier, and the coquettish French girl with the chestnut hair. Time and toil had worn them down, but their love was unchanged and, no doubt, eternal.Portraits of a true love story, see the slideshow: "

(AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d36b2100004202c96473.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Immigration and civil rights groups filed a suit Friday against the federal government, alleging it is trampling on due process by making it nearly impossible for women and children to make the case they should not be deported to their native countries where they face dangerous conditions.The suit was filed by the National Immigration Law Center, American Civil Liberties Union, American Immigration Council and National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild on behalf of seven mothers being held in detention in Artesia, New Mexico. Thousands of mothers with children have been apprehended this year after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, along with an influx of unaccompanied minors traveling without their parents. The increase largely comes from the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, and many of the immigrants have said they are fleeing violence there. But with its system strained from the increase of illegal entries, the government has attempted to deter further illegal border crossings by sending a tough message abroad that those caught will be deported -- a message made in part by speedy removals. At least 280 women and children already been deported from the Artesia facility, the Los Angeles Times reported earlier this month. The immigrant rights groups alleged that deportations from the Artesia facility have come through fast-tracked removal proceedings that provide little chance for mothers and children to make a case for why they should be allowed to stay. The facility is about three and a half hours away from El Paso, Texas, and from Albuquerque, New Mexico, making visits from lawyers difficult, and the suit alleges the women's phone calls with attorneys have been cut off after three minutes. The women have been forced to recount stories of abuse, including sexual assault, in front of their children and were told repeatedly by ICE agents that they would be deported, regardless of individual circumstances, according to the lawsuit. Marielena Hincapi√©, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, told reporters on a press call that based on visits to the Artesia facility and conversations with the women, the groups believe the government has a pattern of human and civil rights violations. ""We filed on behalf of these seven courageous mothers because they are doing what every mother would do. They took risks and made sacrifices to save their children's lives,"" she said. ""Our message to the federal government is simple: follow the law.""""We urge the administration to stop the deportation mill in Artesia and ensure that these women, who have risked everything to protect their kids, are able to present their cases and not to be deported back to the violence and persecution they have fled,"" she continued.Department of Homeland Security officials said in a statement that the Artesia facility provides access to volunteer attorneys and facilitates their presence, along with keeping in contact with groups providing counsel about their concerns.""The inter-agency response to this unprecedented surge has been both humane and lawful,"" DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron said. ""As a matter of policy, we do not specifically comment on pending litigation.""This story has been updated to include a comment from the Department of Homeland Security."

Brown, who was unarmed at the time of his death, was killed by a local police officer. The chaotic protests that followed highlighted racial tensions in the area. The district is taking extra precautions to make sure students receive help if they were troubled by Brown's death or the subsequent protests. While the school district normally employs 33 full-time counselors for its 11,000 students, it will be almost doubling the number of counselors for the start of school, according to district spokeswoman Jana Shortt. The district's staff also went through additional crisis training this week on how to help kids who are experiencing difficulty over the situation. ""This is an extraordinary event and tragic and unforeseen circumstance, and so we have been focused on being ready to care for the needs of our students when they return to us,"" Shortt told The Huffington Post.A local health services agency, Great Circle, is providing the district with additional counselors. Organizations such as the St. Louis County Children's Service Fund are helping to finance the effort. The additional counselors will be in district schools every day for the first week. Then, after evaluating district need, they will work with administrators to develop a long-term plan for services. ""For the first week, we will be in their schools every day doing daily evaluations with schools,"" Angela Bratcher, clinical director of day treatment services for Great Circle, told The Huffington Post. ""A long-term plan depends what the kids are coming in with ... depends what we're seeing from the kids."" Shortt noted that some of the district's teachers have been ""out in the community doing volunteer work ... so they have a sense of some of what's out there. But certainly when we welcome kids back to school on Monday, we'll have a greater sense of where everybody is at."" The U.S. Department of Education has also pitched in to support Ferguson students. On Thursday, Education Secretary Arne Duncan told HuffPost that the department has been ""working with educators in Ferguson, doing everything we can to be supportive.""  ""This is a unique situation but sadly we have a lot of experience dealing with districts under tremendous stress or duress ... and we stay with these relationships for the long haul,"" said Duncan.He also stressed the important role schools play in helping students deal with difficult situations. ""Education leaders there help to lead the healing, help to lead that community to where it needs to go, which from the outside, seems to be a very different place,"" Duncan said. ""Education leaders there will be a huge part of the solution."" Districts in the area have taken different approaches to dealing with the local unrest. In Illinois' Edwardsville School District, which is about 25 miles away from Ferguson, teachers have been encouraged to ""change the subject and refocus the students"" if the topic of Michael Brown's death arises, reports the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. District Superintendent Ed Hightower told the outlet that the situation in Ferguson should not be discussed in the classroom if it cannot be discussed in an objective way. ""We all have personal opinions about what has gone wrong, what has gone right. And we all have opinions on what should be done,"" Hightower said. ""We don't need to voice those opinions or engage those opinions in the classrooms.""But Bratcher said she wants school to be a safe place for students to talk about their feelings.""Their opinions are not right or wrong. We're just giving them a safe way to talk about it,"" said Bratcher. ""When you can't express your feelings, you might deal with them in unhealthy ways.""Joy Resmovits contributed reporting."

Pete Stark of California.Her host, the chief executive of the British Humanist Association, indulged her for a moment before mentioning that the U.K.‚Äô s All Party Parliamentary Humanist Group was 150 members strong, most of them elected atheists.Earlier this month, Ardiente conceded at the World Humanist Congress meeting in Oxford: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really behind when it comes to humanism in politics.‚ÄùAfter Stark, a Democrat, lost his House seat in 2012, the number of openly atheist politicians in U.S. Congress slipped back to zero.But just because they‚Äôre not out does not mean there are no atheists in the halls of Congress. ‚ÄúWe already know of 24 members of Congress who have told us privately that they don‚Äôt believe in God, but they won‚Äôt come out, of course, and if we tried to out them they would deny it,‚Äù Ardiente said.Stark came out 35 years after first being elected to Congress. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., followed only after leaving office in 2013. Although commonly referred to as an atheist, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona‚Äôs 9th Congressional District does not identify as such, preferring to reject all religious labels.Now James Woods of Arizona‚Äôs 5th Congressional District is running for office. If successful, the Democrat would become the first member of Congress to have openly campaigned as an atheist.Serah Blain at the Secular Coalition for Arizona supports his campaign and thinks many atheist politicians are closeted because of ‚Äúa strong association in the U.S. between morality and religion ‚Äî this idea that morality comes from faith. Right now it‚Äôs still politically risky to say you can be ethical without a belief in God,‚Äù she said.That‚Äôs not the case in England. When former Prime Minister Tony Blair asked staffers whether he should add ‚ÄúGod bless Great Britain‚Äù to the end of a speech they told him, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt America.‚ÄùSpeaking in 2013, Blair said,‚ÄùOne big difference between the U.S. and the U.K. is that it‚Äôs okay to talk about faith openly. In the U.K. we‚Äôre a little more ‚Ä¶ British about that.‚ÄùUnlike the U.S., England has an established church. The queen is not only head of state but also ‚ÄúDefender of the Faith and Supreme Governor‚Äù of the Church of England. In officially religious Britain politicians are uncomfortable talking about religion whereas in officially secular America atheist politicians remain closeted or unelected.Linda Woodhead, professor of sociology of religion at Lancaster University, chalks up what some consider irony to patriotism.‚ÄúAmericans have a much stronger civil religion and a much stronger sense of being a nation under God and chosen by God. It‚Äôs a bit treasonable, unpatriotic, to reject religion,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhereas in Britain, civic identity isn‚Äôt as bound up with being religious anymore. You don‚Äôt seem unpatriotic or amoral if you express your atheism.‚ÄùTom Copley is an atheist and elected member of the London Assembly, which holds Mayor Boris Johnson to account. He said the British approach is also about perception.‚ÄúIn Britain we‚Äôre in general quite uncomfortable with politicians overtly expressing their religious beliefs. When (Prime Minister) David Cameron stands up and says Britain is a Christian country, I think it jars people,‚Äù he said.Cameron made waves in April when he wrote in a column for the Anglican newspaper Church Times, ‚ÄúI believe we should be more confident about our status as a Christian country ‚Ä¶ and, frankly, more evangelical about a faith that compels us to get out there and make a difference to people‚Äôs lives.‚ÄùCameron is often said to be vague about his Christian beliefs whereas his deputy prime minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg, is openly atheist, as is Labor leader and perhaps future prime minister Ed Miliband.Miliband would not be Britain‚Äôs first atheist prime minister if his party takes power in 2015. A spokesperson at the British Humanist Association said that at least four confirmed nonbelievers held the top job in the 20th century.Across the Atlantic, no open atheist has ever been elected president. In a recent Pew Research survey, 53 percent of Americans said they are least likely to choose a candidate who doesn‚Äôt believe in God, down from 63 percent in 2007.Several groups, including the American Humanist Association, are actively working to change negative perceptions of atheists and nonbelievers.‚ÄúHumanist voters want politicians that will stand up against the religious right that works to characterize this country as a Christian nation,‚Äù Ardiente said. ‚ÄúBut most of all, humanist voters just want respectability and equality for nontheists in America.‚ÄùLast year the Center for Humanist Activism launched the Freethought Equality Fund, a political action committee aimed at promoting atheist and humanist candidates and those who support the principles of secular government.And last week the Secular Majority, a nonpartisan grassroots network of organizers, launched campaigns in eight states to identify and endorse federal and state candidates committed to secular government.Blain hopes that shifting demographics and sentiments in Arizona and across the U.S. will prompt more elected officials to mirror the Brits.‚ÄúThings are changing,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut it will take people taking political risks to make that fully happen.‚ÄùYS/AMB END PELLOT"

Colby Dolly and Charles Mayo talk while waiting out a thunderstorm during a protest of the shooting of Michael Brown Wednesday, Aug. 20, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo. Brown's shooting in the middle of a street Aug 9, by a Ferguson policeman has sparked more than week of protests, riots and looting in the St. Louis suburb. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2b2892000004e00fec219.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The recent shooting, of yet another unarmed young black male, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, MO - by a white police officer - makes it abundantly clear that there is a need for a legislatively created Special Prosecutor's Office for the Police. This office should be created not only in the State of Missouri but in every state across the nation. To my knowledge, no such office currently exists anywhere in the United States. However, with police misconduct being so prevalent and increasingly more pervasive and given that it ruptures the very fabric of our society, there is a need for a Special Prosecutor's Office for the Police in each of our 50 states.The time has come to stop talking about the need for special prosecutors in a specific case. The time is upon us to actually do something about it. This should no longer be, as it always has been in the past, just another abstract discussion. Teddy Roosevelt once admonished the nation that just having discussions about problems and solutions in the abstract ""achieve mighty little good""; and that ""change is realized by those who actually take the first concrete step, not those who theorize about the 200th step."" For, as he aptly noted, the problem is in the here and now; and therefore the problem requires attention, actions, and solutions - not just talk, in the here and now. In re-visiting this decades-old topic of the need for a special prosecutor when a police officer shoots and kills a citizen, we must be reminded of the self-evident fact that, before assuming a position in a local law enforcement agency with a job title of ""police officer"" that is carried for the temporary period of the individual's employment, the person lived a life with the title of ""ordinary citizen"" that is carried throughout the duration of the individual's life. ""Police officer"" is simply a temporary employment title held by an ordinary citizen, nothing more.The title of ""police officer"" does not, and should not, mean that the ordinary citizen holding that title is, by virtue of the title, an extraordinary human being or for that matter an extraordinary member of the local law enforcement community that includes, as well, the local prosecutor. As an employment title, police officer simply describes an ordinary citizen who has been tasked with performing a particular multi-faceted municipal law enforcement function. Within that role, this ordinary citizen with the title of ""police officer"" has been vested with the extraordinary power to take the life of another individual. And more often than not, the person is able to justify the killing simply and solely because the ordinary citizen holds the title of ""police officer."" That's a lot of power for an ordinary citizen. Because of such, that ""ordinary citizen"" demands ""special"", even extraordinary oversight when, in the exercise of that extraordinary power, a life of another ordinary citizen is taken, especially when, in the context of the realities of our societal racism, the ordinary citizen exercising that police power is more often than not white; and the ordinary citizen victim of the exercise of that police power is more often than not a black or brown male.Lest we forget the obvious - people are not born police officers. They choose to become police officers. As human beings, they come to their law enforcement job with the same pre-inclinations and biases that all of us garner from our genetic make-up and the environments in which we are nurtured. Thus, the ordinary citizens who choose law enforcement as their life's work are no more or less courageous than other ordinary citizens; they are no more or less cowardly than others; they are no more or less honest than others; they are no more or less wise than others; they are no more or less biased than others; and they engage in misconduct - personally and professionally - no more or less than others. Nonetheless, the very title of ""police officer"" has come to confer a special status and with it special benefits for the ""police officer"" title holding ordinary citizen, which benefits are not accorded to any other ordinary citizen. This includes a ""benefit of the doubt"" to that police officer titled ordinary citizen which is not accorded to any other ordinary citizen - particularly and especially to black and brown males, who are most often the victim of a shooting by a white police officer.Of course race becomes the critical issue in this equation, as it does in virtually all of life's equations in our society. Being white in America confers ""privilege"" - by that fact alone. Conversely, being black or brown in our society confers a less privileged status-by that fact alone. There exists in our country a race-based, de facto ""caste"" system. Born out of their own experience as white individuals and the ""white privilege"" that their whiteness alone bestows on them, most of America's white people believe that police officers are there to serve and protect them. Likewise, many black and brown individuals hold the belief that the police are not present to serve and to protect them, but rather to serve and protect white interests. This stems from, and is perpetuated by everyday encounters - over centuries - that black and brown people have with white law enforcement authorities-experiences that have not been shared by white individuals in our society.Given the superficiality of the discussion about race in our country, it is difficult for most white individuals to believe that police officers would act inappropriately. America's unwillingness to tackle racism head-on allows police officers - particularly white police officers - to believe that they may engage black and brown males without justification and to take unjustified acts against black and brown males, all without consequence to the police officer, in order to serve and protect ""privileged"" white societal interests and individuals. In the not so distant past, New York City former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, more often than not, announced that police officers who were involved in shootings of unarmed black and brown males were entitled to ""the benefit of the doubt."" Yes, he said ""entitled."" This pronouncement came from a mayor who was a former federal prosecutor. In that role had the responsibility to investigate police officer misconduct; and, when he deemed such to be appropriate, to prosecute a police officer for violating the federally guaranteed civil rights of the victim of a police shooting. That's the problem. Giuliani held a view, when he was a prosecutor although he only publicly expressed it as a mayor, which would have made it impossible for him to fairly and effectively investigate a potential criminal activity by a police officer because he was quick to hold and express the view that, simply because the ordinary citizen held the title of ""police officer"", the ordinary citizen titled police officer was entitled to ""the benefit of the doubt"" not accorded to other ordinary citizens. Of course, in the context of a police shooting by a white police officer of a black or brown male, you can see where this is going (e.g. Ferguson, MO).It is the reality that local prosecutors are members of the local law enforcement family that includes local police officers. Local prosecutors rely upon their local police officers to carry out their functions as prosecutors. Local prosecutors could not carry out their functions effectively without a cooperative relationship with the local police officers. It's that simple. It's not rocket science. As part of that equation, local prosecutors must nurture a good working relationship with the local police; and local prosecutors cannot take any actions whatsoever that would breach their fundamental law enforcement family relationship. So it is not surprising that a local prosecutor would believe that a local police officer was ""entitled"" to ""the benefit of the doubt.""Given that reality, the local prosecutor - most often white - cannot fairly and effectively investigate and prosecute a local police officer for misconduct against a black or brown male, without compromising the local prosecutor's relationship with his police brethren. There is an old saying that a ""bad beginning inevitably leads to a bad ending."" So what to do?I propose that, as the good beginning and immediately after a shooting by a police officer - anywhere in America - local authorities need to ensure the perception of a fair, effective, complete, and open investigation of the event. The only way that such can occur is for the investigation of the shooting event--and any potential criminal prosecution of a local police officer, to be taken out of the hands of the local prosecutor's office and to be vested in a State-wide independent special prosecutor's office for the police. A federal investigation and prosecution will not solve the problem simply because prosecution under federal law is restricted, under the provisions of federal law and the standards associated with such, in ways that do not apply to prosecution under a State's laws. At the same time, leaving the assignment of a particular prosecution to the discretion of the State's governor or the State's attorney general in the context and tension of a specific situation will not solve the problem, either. To the contrary- and as we have seen in Missouri- because of the politics and explosive mix of race and law enforcement and competing perceptions of fairness associated therewith, the discretionary option only serves to exacerbate the problem.Reinhold Niebuhr, a major 20th century American theologian, wrote in Christian Realism that ""the purpose of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world."" Likewise, John Rawls proposed, in his seminal book, The Theory of Justice, that the essence of justice is ""fairness.""While the creation of a mandated Special Prosecutor's Office for the Police in each State may not, in and of itself, guarantee perfect justice in the process and in the ultimate outcome, what can be guaranteed is that, if we fail to take this concrete first step now, we will have nothing more than the continuation of endless discussion about the problem and the solution in the abstract. We will ""achieve mighty little good""; we will never realize change; and we will relegate ourselves, as a society, to a future where everything will have appeared to change but nothing really will have changed at all.Thus and in order to address these situations which are laden with perceptions of unfairness born out of the circumstances of the event including the realities of our societal racism, we must, and should, demand that, as a matter of justice, each and every State legislate the creation of a Special Prosecutor's Office for the Police. Nothing less will do."
