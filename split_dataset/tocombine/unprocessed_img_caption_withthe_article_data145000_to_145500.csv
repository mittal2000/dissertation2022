But there's one icon who's been conspicuously absent on our list of notables to follow: Kate Moss.Yet it turns out the supermodel legend IS on the photo-sharing network, after all. In September's Interview magazine, which Miss Moss covers, she reveals she has a secret account. Here's how the conversation went down when Kate's interviewer noted her absence across social media:INTERVIEW: Young models today are social-media stars. You don't have a Twitter account. That game is not for you.What do you think she shares? Yoga poses? Sultry selfies? Food photos? Shoe porn? Mani Monday?Sigh. We suppose we should respect Kate's request for privacy... But if you need us, we'll be searching Instagram for various permutations of her name. Picture these with the Valencia filter over 'em:Want more?

1,DIVORCE,Divorce Study Identifies Who Is Most At Risk For Post-Divorce Depression,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/divorce-study_us_5b9d780fe4b03a1dcc88611d,New research suggests that divorce doesn't necessarily trigger depression. Lead researcher David Sbarra of the University,2013-08-27,Couples Who Share Housework Are More Likely To Divorce,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a96fd22a000028007af6fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"New research suggests that divorce doesn't necessarily trigger depression.According to a new study in Clinical Psychological Science, a journal published by the Association for Psychological Science, divorce can increase the risk of depression for some people, but not others. The authors found that nearly 60 percent of people who divorced during the study and who had previously experienced depression reported another depressive episode after their split. This is compared to only 10 percent of people without a history of depression who reported post-divorce depression. That means that those who have a history of depression are more likely to experience a depressive episode after a divorce or separation.Lead researcher David Sbarra of the University of Arizona explained in a press release that these findings show that the majority of people are able to bounce back from divorce without experiencing a severe bout of depression. He also explained that these findings can help specialists understand how to treat people after divorce.“It is very important for clinicians to know that a person’s history of depression is directly related to whether or not they will experience a depressive episode following the end of marriage,” he said. “People with a history of depression who become divorced deserve special attention for support and counseling services.”The researchers used data from Midlife In The United States (MIDUS), a longitudinal, national study that surveyed over 7,000 Americans ages 25-74. This isn't the first study to link divorce and depression. A recent report out of Finland found that antidepressant use spikes in the months before divorce. And a 2011 study found that children of divorce are more likely to have suicidal thoughts.Click through the slideshow below for other interesting divorce findings.Keep in touch!

If you're not there, start by getting closer to what you love.  Small steps towards a new direction now drastically changes where your journey ends.",2013-08-27,2013-08-26-ryanmckeeverpostpicturesweatyselfies.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-08-26-ryanmckeeverpostpicturesweatyselfies.jpg,"I inadvertently had one of those rare moments of clarity where I unraveled what my life's work has to be. I had a really big holy-crap-this-is-what-I'm meant-to-do-in-life moment. Here's how I got to that point and how you can purposefully do the best work of your life and figure your $#!& out so you don't waste as much time as I did.Look.I've been fortunate enough to have great marketing jobs and have done some very cool things. I got Kathy Griffin to make a sex tape with Dame Judy Dench (to promote Kathy's reality show). And while great and amazing, there was something always a little off. This week I've been at Hubspot's #Inbound13 marketing conference, and it was here I figured out exactly what was off.My first moment of clarity came to me when Seth Godin said two words: generosity and art. Because we're all so connected now, the world needs marketing leaders who are generous and artists to make it a better place. You see, that is the epitome of who I am. I want to help. I have a unique perspective. And that's been the case my whole life. The world has finally caught up to me and now I can begin.It's a powerful feeling after sitting on the sidelines for so long. The world wasn't quite ready for me. And now everything is culminating in such a grand way and I am now abundantly qualified to take on the world. To inspire. To lead. To make it a better place.Two things had to happen for me to get my moment of clarity. First, I followed my passion. I did what I love. And while something was off for a long time, it was as close as I could get at the time. If you're not there, start by getting closer to what you love. Small steps towards a new direction now drastically changes where your journey ends.Second, I opened myself up to new thoughts and ideas. I got myself to the right place at the right time to get the right insight that changed my soul. If you want to figure it out purposefully, then put yourself out there. Look around. Explore. Investigate. Be curious. And from the exposure you'll find that gem of wisdom that completes you.Listen.I also picked up a tip through osmosis. A couple of speakers at the conference, Aaron Ross and Joseph Jaffe, preached ""Follow your intuition."" They reminded us about Steve Jobs and the whisperings in his head.I had been silencing the whispers in my head. That's what I was supposed to do. To be normal. To fit in. And now I have given myself permission -- and am completely okay with -- listening to the voices in my head.My advice to you: Listen to the voices in your head. They are there. There's always a gut feeling. Go with that. My voices are saying: Wake up. It's your time. Go. Do it. Don't worry. What are yours saying?Lose.I went to hear a session titled ""Finding the Strength to Write Our Stories"" by Erika Napoletano but she was having a meltdown. She no longer wanted to be a speaker about marketing... she wanted to help people find their passion. She threw away her session and created a new one called ""How to Lose Your $#*!"".Her point: When the story you are telling yourself and the story you are telling others isn't the same, lose your $#*!. Pour your heart out. Get it all out there. Then figure out what your story is. Feeling empowered, I did. I am truly grateful to my husband, my friends and the poor conference attendees who listened to my $#*!.What Erica said is true. When you let go, you re-center yourself. You connect back to yourself. You say things you've never said before. You speak the truth. You figure it out. So go ahead. Lose your $#*!.Leap. I'll be forever grateful to Beth Dunn who smacked me over the head with a brilliant personal story and a couple of lessons. Beth hates running but has lost 75 pound to date by running. How'd she do it? She takes a picture of herself every time after she works out. She's motivated to keep the streak going so she'd endure the pain of running to keep the streak alive. But more importantly she doesn't feel compelled to run huge distances or very fast every time. She just needs to run, break a sweat and get her  #sweatyselfies. In doing so, she's learned to love running. Her point: Lower your standards. Focus on keeping the streak alive. Take action. Just do it. It will help you do the best work of your life.So Beth, this one's for you... here's my new blog with my newly lowered standards. It's dedicated to sharing the many mistakes we've made in life (with an emphasis on the marketing mistakes) and the lessons we've learned from them."

The National Trust in England has installed a 57-foot, stainless steel slide on the Cliveden House property.According to the website, the nearly 350-year-old historic estate's south terrace is undergoing renovations, and instead of completely shutting down the area, they decided to have a little fun. ""Today we want to keep that spirit alive so when planning this major project, we couldn't just close off the staircase and shield everything from view... instead we're taking advantage of the scaffolding to create a special experience this summer,"" says the website.Four people can go down the slide at anytime and it takes about five to seven seconds to go from top to bottom -- pretty cool, huh?

Our goal: live on $1,000 (each) a month.This isn't a particularly difficult thing to do if you don't do much, but we had big plans. We wanted to explore new foods and cultures, experience unique adventures, and travel places where traveling wasn't easy. We also wanted to do this on a pretty tight timeline, spending no longer than a month in any given country. (I know this sounds luxurious, but we've met many people on the road who spend a minimum of three months wherever they go. Compared to them, we're breezing through.)A small budget and a limited timeline would've been challenging enough, if we didn't have our own unique ""problem"": we weren't typical backpackers! Not only were we several years past 21, but instead of leaving the basement of our parents' houses, we were leaving behind our beautiful loft in San Francisco, a closet full of my designer shoes, even our engagement and wedding rings! And on our honeymoon only 18 months prior, we'd gone to French Polynesia and stayed at resorts that cost $1000+ per night.Now that's how much we'd have to spend over 30 days. After doing our research, we realized there was one part of the world particularly well-suited to our goals: Southeast Asia. Not only was it more affordable than Europe and South America, but it would allow us to engage with cultures that were completely different than our own. The wildlife and scenery were supposed to be incredible, and the opportunity for adventure and discovery was endless.So that's how we ended up in Burma, a country that only recently opened its borders to foreigners. We ate tea leaf salad and drank herbal tea, spoke to retired teachers about their hopes for the future, and, on the fourth night of our trip, spent the night in a wooden shack after trekking 20 kilometers through hills and rice paddies, complete with water buffalo and naked children.A few days later, after 50 more kilometers of walking, we ended up at Inle Lake, a magical misty place where traditional fisherman still row with their feet so their hands can be free for fishing. We negotiated a boat tour with a local boatman, who quickly grabbed his nephew and introduced him as our ""guide."" Over the next eight hours, we visited floating vegetable gardens, artisan workshops, and the crumbilng stupas of Indein. The cost: less than $20.On the eleventh day, we spent hours getting lost and falling off bicycles in the dusty desert that is Bagan. Thousands of burnt red brick temples, most built in the 12th and 13th centuries, are all the more magnificent in their decay and create a picture, and sunrise, that makes you believe in miracles. Many are completely deserted, and with a flashlight and sarong in tow, it's possible to climb up and observe the amazing vistas all around you.So how have things gone since then? We've been on the road full-time for over half a year, and we're still sticking to our goal -- though we did blow our budget by diving at Sipadan in the fifth month.Has it been easy? Not always, and we've had to use our silk sleepsheet on too many occasions to count.Has it been worth it? Absolutely! And while I miss the high thread sheet comforters and exquisite decor of the St. Regis, I'd pick one month on the road over one day in Bora Bora any time of year!"
