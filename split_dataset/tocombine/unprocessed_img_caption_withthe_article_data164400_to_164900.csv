Much to my surprise, I learned even more about myself from Cesar Millan than I did about my dog.",2013-02-04,"This undated publicity image courtesy of Cesar Millan/Cesarsway.com shows Millan with his dog Junior. Dog whisperer Cesar Millan would like his pit bull Junior to continue as ""an ambassador for powerful breeds, reinforcing the message that it's not the breed, it's the human behind the animal."" And Junior to Millan? ""Accept yourself,"" he said. (AP Photo/Cesar Millan/Cesarsway.com)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc7282100003000c5429b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I started watching The Dog Whisperer about a year after my sudden divorce. Much to my surprise, I learned even more about myself from Cesar Millan than I did about my dog. He always says in his show that he ""rehabilitates dogs,"" but he ""trains people."" In my case, he helped to rehabilitate me after a particularly difficult time in my life. Here are the life lessons I learned from the Dog Whisperer:1) Energy Transfer Whenever Cesar meets with a new case, he watches the owner(s) interact with the dogs. He pays more attention to the behavior of the owner than that of the dog. His claim is that anxiety or a lack of confidence in the owner transfers to the dog. In our lives apart from dogs, we also transfer energy. If you find that you experience stress interacting with someone, check your own energy. What are you responsible for transferring? 2) Don't Grip the Leash Too Tightly This is an extension of the lesson above. When you watch the owners walk their troubled dogs, they grip the leash too tightly and pull with all their might if their dogs lunges at another dog. This is transferring the anxiety to dog, but even more importantly, it is giving power to the anxiety. In order to control the dog, the owner has to learn to let go of the illusion of control and has to begin to trust their dog. In our lives, we also tend to grip too tightly -- to relationships, to ideas, to beliefs. Try loosening your grip and learning to trust instead of always trying to control.3) Prepare for Greetings Cesar always prepares the dogs carefully before allowing them to enter a dog park or greet other dogs. He makes sure that they are calm and submissive so that they are well-received by the rest of the pack. It is worthwhile to check your own mental state before greeting someone. I know I can come in from a stressful day and take it out on my fiancé instead of pausing and waiting until my own mind was calm. And, no, I'm not recommending that you start greeting people by sniffing their butts!4) Work With Nature According to Cesar, dogs process the world through their noses first, followed by their ears and eyes. Obviously, we tend to use those senses in reverse, and we all too often expect that from out pets. Cesar advocated working with the nature of the animal so that you get the results you are looking for with the least amount of resistance. Look around you. Not everyone perceives the world the way you do. Do you expect them to conform to you, or do you allow them to use their nature?5) Be Aware of the Precursors On the show, Cesar will often correct a dog when I cannot see any misbehavior. Until the sequence is played in slow motion, that is. Then, you can see a slight tuck of the tail or a tip of the ear, a slight precursor to the attack that is about to occur. Cesar is so successful because he recognizes and responds to these early warning signs. I know in my own life, I am often too busy to notice those little signs, much less respond so quickly to them. 6) Move Forward When dealing with anxious or aggressive dogs, especially ones that he is trying to form a pack with, Cesar frequently begins by taking them for a walk or a rollerblade ride. (I think he has a death wish here!) His reasoning is that when the dogs are moving forward, it is impossible for them to focus on anything else. Now, I do think our brains are more monkey-minded than our canine friends, but we can still benefit from forward movement to calm ourselves. So, when you are angry, sad, or anxious, try going for a walk. Or a rollerblade ride, if you're more daring than I!7) Calm and Assertive Cesar always works to get the dogs in a calm and submissive state. The counterpoint to that in the owners is a calm and assertive state. He is very kinesthetic and models what this looks like: shoulders back, head relaxed, arms relaxed. It projects confidence and a calm mind. When I feel stressed, I find myself emulating the body language of Cesar to trick my mind into responding. Sometimes it is easier to teach the body and let the mind follow. 8) Trust Your Senses Cesar relies heavily on intuition; he does not spend too much time in the ""thinky place."" He trusts his instincts and, when he needs extra information, he trusts the instincts of his pack as they give him feedback on a new dog. We all too often discount intuition and try to over-analyze everything. Sometimes, it is better to trust your gut or the gut of a friend if yours is out of order.9) Allow Them to Approach Cesar knows that trust cannot be forced. When he is working with a fearful dog, he allows that dog to approach him rather than invading the dog's space. When the dog is allowed to make the initial movement, he/she will begin to trust. Humans aren't much different. My husband's affair destroyed my trust, but I was able to learn to trust again but it had to be on my own terms and when I was ready.10) Differentiate Noise From Threat Sometimes Cesar encounters a dog that is snarling and growling, looking as if it is ready to snap, yet he ignores the behaviors, dismissing it as ""just noise"" and not a serious threat. Our brains like to snarl and growl, too. It is important to recognize when this is simply noise and safe to ignore and when it is an alarm sounding at the approach of a serious threat.11) See the Possible About once a month, I see an episode with a dog that I think is hopeless. Cesar doesn't give up. Some cases take longer and take more effort, but they can all improve. He brings the worst cases to his ranch, where they are surrounded by a healthy and stable pack. This is a good lesson in our own lives when troubles seem insurmountable. Improvement is always possible. Learn from Cesar -- if you need more help, surround yourself with those who are healthy and balanced. Their energy will transfer. And, if that doesn't work, maybe try chasing a tennis ball.12) Redirect With Play Need I say more?For more by Lisa Arends, click here.For more on wisdom, click here."

How much money do we have? Are we in a fulfilling romantic relationship? Do we have the career of our dreams? A great body? Most of us spend a large amount of our lives striving for these things, thinking they are the keys to happiness and peace of mind, only to find that once we get them, we keep wanting the next thing. There's always a next desire waiting to be fulfilled, with happiness dangling like a carrot just out of our reach. We always want more, it seems, when it comes to the outside world. And I'm sure you know people who seem to have it all but don't seem happy. So what gives?In The Happiness Prescription, spiritual teacher and author Deepak Chopra shares his 10 keys to true happiness.First, Deepak examines the question: What is happiness, anyway? He says when you really get down to it, people say they want peace, harmony, laughter and love. He defines happiness as a subjective state of well-being, joy and ease, when you're in the flow and things just unfold as they're supposed to.If you're happy, he says, you're going to be healthier, have better relationships, do good/meaningful work and be successful and abundant -- not the other way around.Deepak claims that there's a formula for happiness, which depends on three things:Our brain's set point for happiness. One person sees a problem where another sees an opportunity -- could this be genetically determined? Deepak suggests that a regular meditation practice can change this biological set point, along with cognitive therapy (changing your false beliefs that are making you depressed).Our life situation. Are you healthy? Do you have a nice house? Did you win the lottery? These things may actually be a very minor determinant of our happiness. They may make us happy in the short-term, but down the road we will go back to our pre-programmed happiness set point. A small percentage of our happiness quotient, Deepak says, is actually based on our life situation.Our voluntary actions and the choices we make. Making choices that lead to fulfillment and deeper gratification really makes us happy. Having a sense of accomplishment, making a difference in the lives of others or in the world, feeling inspired, intuitive and conscious. This can bring great happiness, and making other people happy is what makes us most happy.From a combination of ancient wisdom and more recent scientific research, Deepak derived his 10 keys to happiness:1) Be aware of your body. Your body is a cosmic computer of universal intelligence. Listen to your body's messages of comfort and discomfort, and you'll spontaneously be able to make the right choices.2) Live in the present moment. Don't attach yourself to anything or anticipate events. Just go with the flow, and you will connect to the domain of consciousness called nirvana.3) Embrace silence. Meditate and observe your breath. The silence space between your thoughts is a field of infinite possibilities.4) Relinquish your need for external approval. Be free of both criticism and flattery. Feel neither superior or inferior to anyone.5) Get rid of your toxic emotions. Having a grievance is like drinking poison and thinking it will kill your enemy. Let go of your hostilities and anger.6) Have complete knowledge of yourself. The world is a mirror of your state of consciousness. Ask yourself, ""Who am I? What do I want?""7) Don't judge others and don't judge yourself. Wake up and be thankful for being exactly as you are. Say to yourself, ""Today, I will judge nothing that occurs."" Forgive your shadows and the shadows of others.8) Remove toxins from your life. Toxic substances, food, habits, emotions, work, relationships, environments, etc. It only creates imbalance in our lives.9) Replace fear-based thinking with love-based thinking. Every time you're making a choice, ask yourself if it's going to cultivate the experience of unity and love or the experience of separation and stress.10) Witness your awareness. Witness yourself as if in a movie. This means that you realize you're not your body or your mind; you are the alert witness to your consciousness.GaiamTV.com ambassador Jenny Sansouci is the publisher of HealthyCrush.com, where she writes about nutrition, health, yoga and personal development.

ANA and JAL said they replaced lithium-ion batteries in their Boeing 787 Dreamliners on multiple occasions before a battery overheating incident led to the worldwide grounding of the jets. ANA said Wednesday, Jan. 30, it replaced batteries on its 787 aircraft some 10 times because they failed to charge properly or showed other problems, and informed Boeing about the swaps. JAL said it had also replaced lithium-ion batteries on its 787 jets but couldn't immediately give details. (AP Photo/Koji Sasahara, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e64d250000cf003892a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Here's a mystery: What connects the following two stories appearing side by side on the front of the Saturday New York Times Business section (Jan. 26, 2013)? One is a column by James Stewart on legal implications of the lithium-ion battery whose failure has grounded Boeing's 787 Dreamliners. The other story reports how a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, DePuy Orthopaedics, concealed critical data on a design flaw in a metal hip implant.The battery was manufactured by the Japanese government-subsidized GS Yuasa. Question: was there an illegal quid pro quo between Boeing and the also-subsidized Japan Airlines to buy the first run of Dreamliners in exchange for the battery contract? The deal raises another question too: how come Boeing sole-sourced the battery to GS Yuasa, instead of also contracting with better-known suppliers? And finally, given the long-known propensity of lithium-ion batteries to catch fire, how come the critical battery wasn't more thoroughly tested?As for DePuy Orthopaedics, acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 1998, it knowingly continued to sell the defective implant for years. By the time the implant was finally recalled in 2010, some 93,000 patients were at risk of crippling failures. Two years later, Johnson & Johnson is still defending the indefensible.I first learned the connection between these stories not from the economics literature, but from a journalist, Barry C. Lynn. In two books, End of the Line (2006), and Cornered: the New Monopoly Capitalism and the Economics of Destruction (2010), and many journal articles, Lynn documents the recent rapid transformation of global corporations from integrated manufacturers to monopolistic distributors. As distributors, giant lead firms like Boeing and Johnson & Johnson either acquire subsidiaries to do their manufacturing, or better yet, contract out the work. Often rival firms depend on the same suppliers. As in the case of Boeing's Dreamliner, they even contract out the design. This delegation of work increases short-term profits both by saving costs and by allowing the lead firms to focus on market control. But it results in a lack of supervision and eventual disasters like the battery and hip implant.The ""new monopoly capitalists"" don't just fail to supervise. They adopt a deliberate business strategy of ""rationalization"": simplifying product lines by eliminating variety, cutting R&D, and suppressing research by buying up patents and freezing them. As Matt Stoller recently reported, ""Lazy Corporate Monopolies Are Why America Can't Have Nice Things.""The new monopolists squeeze suppliers and play off governments against each other to obtain tax and regulatory concessions. Josh Eidelson at the Nation reports that before the disastrous garment factory fire in Bangladesh, Walmart apparently forced its suppliers to cut corners on safety. The New York Times ran a recent series on how Amazon and others manipulate local governments in the U.S. Reuters reports ""Japan eased safety standards ahead of Boeing 787 rollout.""Of course the new monopolists also do what the old ones did: raise prices in captive markets. In his new book, The Fine Print, David Cay Johnston reports how AT&T has sneakily raised prices over the years by adding little ""fees"" to our phone bills.Today, giant international monopolists dominate every corner of commerce: Boeing and Lockheed in aviation, or JBS Swift and Cargill in meatpacking, or Johnson & Johnson and Beckton-Dickinson in medical supplies, or Exxon-Mobil and BP in oil, or Deutsche Bank, Barclays and JP Morgan in banking. All by itself there's the Italian firm Luxottica, which controls the entire world eyeglass business from manufacturing to retail outlets.I call Barry Lynn ""prophetic"" because in his 2006 book, End of the Line, he predicted that the rationalizing and contracting out strategies of the giant monopolists would lead inevitably to collapses of key industries, and greater and greater dependence on government support. His prediction came true with the 2008 collapse and bailout of the banking industry. (See Matt Taibbi's ""Secrets and Lies of the Bailout."") In the pharmaceutical industry we're already seeing periodic shortages of key vaccines and medications, as squeezed suppliers go out of business. The lithium-ion battery and hip implant stories bode ill for the aerospace and medical supply industries. Who's next?"

The Dow hits 14,000, the unemployment rate rises in January, and GDP actually falls in the last three months of 2012. Could it be that what's good for the stock market is bad for the rest of the economy? Could it be that captains of industry like weak labor markets, high unemployment, low wages -- and a Federal Reserve that has to use ultra-low interest rates to try to keep things afloat?Well, yes, but the story is also richer and more complicated.Basically, the economy is still weighted down by the legacy effects of the financial collapse of 2008 -- mortgages that exceed the value of homes, students staggering under the weight of college loans in a dismal job market, retired people for whom low interest rates mean low returns on savings, corporations looting pensions, and above all flat or declining wages.It all adds up to a very weak recovery -- but the common element is insufficient purchasing power on the part of ordinary families. And this is about to be compounded by Fiscal Cliff II, namely Congress and the president deciding that what the economy really needs is a bracing dose of deflationary budget cuts.What exactly happened in the last quarter of 2012 to cause the recovery not just to stall -- but to actually shrink the economy by a tenth of a point? According to the Commerce Department, there were multiple factors.Exports slumped, business purchases to replenish inventory slowed, but here is the sentence that screams out: ""Real federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment decreased 15.0 percent in the fourth quarter, in contrast to an increase of 9.5 percent in the third."" In other words, cut government spending and you undermine a fragile recovery. There was a little good news amid the bad news. Revised numbers indicate that the economy generated jobs in 2012 at a rate of about 32,000 a month more than first reported. But hidden unemployment -- part timers not finding full-time jobs -- rose again in January and wages have remained basically flat. The economy's gains still go mainly to the very top.Seemingly, President Obama has moved off the deficit-hawk kick that marked his posture in 2010 when he appointed the Bowles-Simpson Commission, and 2011 when he agreed to a budget deal with massive cuts and automatic triggers adding up to about $4 trillion in deficit cuts over a decade.Seemingly, too, the corporate-led ""Fix the Debt Campaign"" -- millionaires and billionaires telling the rest of America to tighten its belt for the greater good -- isn't getting a great deal of traction. Our friend Paul Krugman last week wrote a column, ""Deficit Hawks Down,"" saying that we should pity this crowd -- for all the money they've spent, they keep being contradicted by events. But despite the sheer unreality of their claims, the austerity lobby keeps winning by defining the terms of debate. Nearly everyone, right, center and left, is arguing about the economic recovery in terms of what the debt-to-GDP ratio should be in 2023.That is the wrong question. The right question is: how do we get a stronger recovery going now? With robust growth, especially of wages, the debt ratio will come down. Excessive budget cutting in a depressed economy slows growth and worsens the debt ratio, but with the exception of Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, and your faithful blogger, that's not a point widely made in the debate. (Let's also credit Jamie Galbraith, Bob Reich, Larry Mishel and Dean Baker.)But our gang doesn't get invited into the rooms where deals are cut, and isn't having much influence on what passes for debate among what Krugman calls Very Serious People, namely the debate among Obama, the Republicans, the Wall Streeters, and the suite of deficit-hawk lobbies underwritten by billionaire Pete Peterson.In 1945, the debt ratio was much larger than today -- 120 percent of GDP versus today's 72 percent. But anyone in 1945 urging that the main economic issue was the debt ratio in 1955 would have been laughed out of town. The main issue was how to re-employ 12 million returning G.I.sYet consider what passes for debate today.President Obama, newly in deficit-dove mode, declares that we have achieved so much deficit reduction that we need ""only"" about another $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction over a decade to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio by 2022. Obama's budget actually cuts net public investment to achieve that goal. It cuts public investment!Then, the center-left Center on Budget and Policy Priorities re-calculates the numbers, and pronounces that it will really take ""only"" $1.2 trillion in deficit cuts over a decade (counting saved interest costs) to stabilize the debt ratio. Whoopee, only $120 billion a year in budget cuts a year and we hit the target.And then the progressive EPI re-computes the data yet again, and figures that we can get to the holy grail of a stable debt ratio with only $670 billion in further deficit cuts -- and very helpfully challenges the entire premise that deficit reduction is the road to recovery.Uh-oh -- the center-right is not amused.The Pete-Peterson-funded Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget takes offense and warns that we really need another $2.2 trillion in new deficit cuts.Rudy Penner, director of the CBO in the Reagan era, declares stabilizing the debt ratio at its current level of about 70 percent is not enough. In this priceless twist of economic logic, Penner warns:""Imagine facing the next recession with a debt-GDP ratio already above 70 percent. It is almost certain that we shall have another slump before 2022.""Yes indeed, Rudy, if we listen to folks like you and follow a fiscal policy of slash-and-burn, we are guaranteed to have another slump between now and 2022 -- quite possibly a continuing slump for the entire decade.People: this is the wrong debate. Has any of these worthies taken a macro-economics course? If you slow down growth by excessive belt-tightening, tax revenues fall and the deficit goes up. You can't just assume that very dollar of deficit reduction equals a dollar credited to reduction of the debt ratio.For budget wonks, this very useful piece by EPI's Ethan Pollack lays it all out.President Obama should read every word of this.In what passes for the debate about the budget and the economy, two other details keep being overlooked: The main driver of rising deficits over the long term is Medicare. You fix Medicare by reforming the larger health system of which it is a part, not by sandbagging the rest of the budget and economy.And speaking of economic contraction, one other key item somehow got lost in the shuffle. As part of President Obama's tax deal with House Speaker John Boehner raising taxes ""only"" on the richest one percent, America's working people got a big tax increase when both parties agreed to let the two-point cut in the payroll tax expire.So since January 1, wage and salary workers have had two percent less income to spend. That's a huge hit -- as if every American worker suddenly took a two percent pay cut. The tax deal amounted to a big tax increase on the bottom 99 -- terrible policy distributively, terrible policy macro-economically.(Some liberals worried about the drain of the two-point tax break on the Social Security trust funds, but that money should be made whole by transfers from general revenue; reducing the burden of the regressive payroll tax was a huge gain for progressivity.)In sum: unless we stop obsessing on cutting the debt ratio as an end in itself, we are condemned to a decade of economic underperformance.President Obama got some nice political lift from his re-election and his new, more assertive tone.

On the same day, with delicious timing, Carney will be wrapping up testimony to British lawmakers just as the BoE announces the results of its own policy meeting.The unanimous verdict of economists polled by Reuters is that neither bank will change its stance. The environment, however, is shifting, presenting both with unwanted challenges.The ECB must keep a close eye on the euro, which has risen to a 14-month peak against the dollar and a 30-month high against the yen, reflecting the Federal Reserve's promise to keep buying bonds until U.S. unemployment falls much farther and the Bank of Japan's plan for a much looser monetary policy.Exchange rates have much less of an impact on trade volumes than the state of external demand.But, with global growth languishing, the relative performance of euro zone exporters will take a hit, said Daniel McCormack, a strategist at Macquarie in London.""The euro could well be starting to cause a bit of pain already. It's moved up significantly, and in the context of what Japan's doing and the Fed's desire to get the dollar down or keep it low, it will have some impact,"" he said. WHAT MIGHT THE ECB DO?France has already complained about the euro's climb and Germany has blamed Japan for encouraging a weaker yen.But Goldman Sachs said an ECB rate cut in response to a rising euro was still some way off, not least because the currency's vigour was largely due to improving economic and financial news from the euro zone.The bank's economists did acknowledge, however, that the risks to its forecast that rates will stay on hold in 2013 were skewed to the downside.""While global growth is picking up and demand growing, concerns about appreciation may be muted. But a strengthening euro in a stagnant global economy is likely to prompt questions about where the 'pain threshold' of German exporters to the level of the euro exchange rate lies,"" they said in a report.Like the dollar, sterling has also fallen to a 14-month low against the euro.British policymakers view a weaker pound as part of the solution to reviving the economy, which stagnated in 2012, and Goldman is among those who expect continued depreciation given the prospect of a more innovative and expansionary monetary policy under Carney.McCormack reckons the shortfall in Britain's potential output that has opened up due to the recession is so great that the BOE might not need to contemplate tightening until 2018 - a full decade after the financial crisis climaxed.But he said it was debatable whether Carney would prevail with his suggestion of targeting nominal gross domestic product, which implies permitting a temporary overshoot of inflation to allow growth to catch up.""Most central bankers at the end of the day are in favour of strict inflation targeting. So he'll face a lot of intellectual pushback if he tries to get that through. But clearly there's the potential for some significant policy innovations once he's on board because he'll want to make his mark,"" McCormack said. TRADE POLICY AND DATA IN SPOTLIGHTCentral banks are not alone in rummaging around for new ways to spur growth.European Union leaders, who hold a summit on Thursday devoted mainly to the bloc's budget, are expected to call for maximum efforts to reach a series of bilateral free trade pacts to lower tariffs and cut red tape throttling exports.The prospects for talks with the United States and Canada are still up in the air, but leaders are likely to endorse an early start to talks with Japan, according to diplomats.Trade figures happen to be the core of this week's global economic releases.Britain's gaping goods deficit is forecast to show a small improvement, due in part to sterling's weakness.China's imports are projected to leap, which would bode well for world growth.But, like most early-year data from Asia, interpretation will be treacherous because of calendar distortions: Lunar New Year, when factories in China close en masse, falls this year on Feb. 10, while last year the week-long holiday was in January.America is likely to show a narrower trade deficit in December. Improving net exports would reinforce the view that the unexpected dip in GDP last quarter was due to fleeting factors and not the harbinger of a trend.Bruce Kasman, an economist with JP Morgan in New York, said after Friday's good-but-not-great January jobs report that the economy was on track to expand about 2 percent this year despite fiscal drag that would lop at least 1.5 percent off growth.Kasman said he was heartened by solid gains in labour income in recent months. Risks of a break-up of the euro, a hard landing in China and a plunge off the fiscal cliff in the United States had also been avoided.All this pointed to steady if unspectacular U.S. growth.""We don't have by any means the kind of growth that we would like, but we are setting ourselves up for a world where there's less risk and more sustainability,"" Kasman said on a conference call."

The deal is expected to take effect on March 4, after a public comment period, he said.Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the deal guaranteed Mexican farmers access to the U.S. market under conditions that were ""fair and competitive.""""We worked hand in hand with Mexican producers on this agreement to avoid damage to the sector,"" he said.The U.S. Commerce Department made a preliminary decision in September to terminate the 1996 tomato agreement after Florida growers complained that the arrangement no longer protected them against Mexican tomatoes sold below the cost of production.That angered Mexican growers, who argued the pact had benefited U.S. consumers and brought stability to the North American market.Mexican officials said the U.S. move appeared designed to help President Barack Obama carry Florida in his election battle against Republican Mitt Romney. Obama won the state in the November contest.Mexico exports about $1.9 billion worth of tomatoes to the United States each year. Varieties include common round, cherry, grape, plum, greenhouse and pear tomatoes. The industry says Florida producers have not kept pace with new growing techniques that produce tastier tomatoes and have propelled Mexican sales. FOUR CATEGORIESThe proposed agreement spares Mexican growers from having to wage a costly legal battle against a new anti-dumping case brought by Florida producers.It also averts the possibility of a broader trade war. U.S. business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce feared Mexico could retaliate if the United States slapped hefty duties on Mexican tomatoes.Reggie Brown, executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Exchange, stopped short of endorsing the agreement but said it vindicated the U.S. industry's position that Mexican growers were ""dumping"" their tomatoes in the United States.""Mexican growers and their government have tried to protect their interests with tremendous pressure on our government, threats to U.S. producers and a well-funded lobbying and media campaign,"" Brown said.""The facts, however, were clear and could not be disputed. Mexican tomatoes were being sold in the U.S. market in rapidly increasing volumes at prices that did not reflect the cost of production,"" he said.The new pact sets reference prices for four categories of tomatoes, instead of just one under the current pact. It also broadens coverage to include essentially all Mexican growers and exporters, the Commerce Department said.The four categories, from least to most expensive, are ""open field and adapted environment"" tomatoes, ""controlled environment"" tomatoes, ""specialty loose"" tomatoes and ""specialty packed"" tomatoes.The agreement sets winter and summer references prices for each category. The winter prices range from 31 cents per pound for open field and adapted environment tomatoes to 59 cents for specialty packed. The summer prices range from 24.6 cents to 46.8 cents per pound.The single reference price for all Mexican tomatoes under the current agreement is 21.6 cents per pound in the winter and 17.2 cents in the summer.

And to know Pete Townshend a lot (as guitarist, singer, rocker, lyricist, poet, author, producer, philanthropist and, objectively-speaking, visionary) is to love him even more. But let us also consider Pete Townshend the brilliant technical innovator.This was precisely the focal point at this year's 28th Annual TEC Awards (Technical Excellence and Creativity), at which Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and Kennedy Center Honoree Mr. Townshend found himself the recipient of the 22nd Annual Les Paul Award -- a major honor celebrating ""individuals or institutions that have set the highest standards of excellence in the creative application of audio technology.""The gala event brightened a rainy night in Anaheim, where the legendary figure and co-founder of the best-named rock band ever -- The Who -- was not at all ""Exquisitely Bored in California"" (to quote from one of his many exemplary solo compositions) but rather very warmly celebrated by 1,000 top audio-industry professionals as well as a host of his well-established peers, in a lively evening hosted by John Sebastian, formerly of The Lovin' Spoonful.Video of Highlights from the Award CeremonyThe Les Paul Award being one of those accolades such as a ""Lifetime Achievement"" award in which the recipient is known well ahead of time, the organizers of the event traditionally extend the winner of that specific award the courtesy of being able to suggest who he/she might like to have present the trophy with accompanying remarks. Townshend selected for his primary award-presenter the producer, humorist and pop-culture historian, Martin Lewis. Messrs. Townshend and Lewis go back some 40 years. It was Lewis, a long-term master of mixing philanthropy with entertainment, who coaxed Townshend to join the successful Secret Policeman's Ball benefit series, in support of Amnesty International, in 1979. There, some say, as Townshend stripped down rock 'n' roll's then-typically-incendiary pageantry for raw, rootsy, acoustic takes on his classics ""Pinball Wizard"", ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" and more, the ""Unplugged"" performance phenomenon was born. Legend has it! For this, and for the many rock stars motivated thereafter by example to play for social and political causes in the 1980s and beyond, Mr. Lewis designated Mr. Townshend, ""an inspiration."" Old pals Pete Townshend and Martin LewisYou may have heard of a few of these other guys who saluted their ""fretboard-wizard"" friend, as brought aboard for the evening's salute by Mr. Lewis. Alphabetically here, by band.From The Animals -- the blues-rock band who were friendly rivals to The Who in the British Invasion era -- appeared, in person, the electrifying Eric Burdon. No stranger to Southern California (where he's lived for decades), Mr. Burdon not only found his way to Anaheim, but to the stage, where he ripped through a blistering rendition of the Who's ""The Seeker,"" in tribute to his peer and fellow-explorer. 26-year-old Australian bass prodigy Tal Wilkenfeld (who currently plays with Jeff Beck) joined the legend to fête another legend.Eric Burdon -- with bassist Tal WilkenfeldIn addition to passionately delivering Townshend's powerful 1970 paean to the quest for spiritual enlightenment to the TEC faithful, Eric has crossed cultural paths with Pete on several occasions, including efforts in a literary vein. Mr. Townshend commissioned and edited Mr. Burdon's 1986 autobiography, I Used to Be an Animal But I'm All Right Now, for British book publishers Faber & Faber. Onstage, the spry, septuagenarian former Animal proved his self-appraisal to be quite true. (Incidentally, Burdon's just released new album 'Til Your River Runs Dry is rich, diverse, soulful and nuanced. It is, to paraphrase the man, unlikely to be misunderstood.)Book editor and author reunitedFrom The Beatles -- whom I understand to be another popular beat music combo that emerged from England in the '60s -- came puckish Paul McCartney -- well, virtually! Sir Paul was in Blighty and couldn't make the event, but did send a lovely hi-def video message, notably in which he appears to be aging backwards, having recently reached somewhere in his early 30s.Quoth Sir Paul: ""Hey, there! Hey, Pete! How ya doin'?! Listen, congratulations on getting this fabulous award, the Les Paul Award. And we all know you deserve it, because, man... we go back! And I have so many great memories of you and the band... your music... seeing you on TV doing ""My Generation""... seeing you live, playing! To this day, you're just great. So, isn't it funny: I've never had a chance to really just stand opposite you and tell you. I'd probably be too embarrassed. Paul McCartney seen in his video greeting to Pete Townshend""But here's the ideal occasion for me to just say what I think everyone in the room is bound to be thinking, which is that you are just a great monster, man! The way you play that guitar...the way you write. It's fantastic! Always has been, hopefully always will be. So congratulations getting the Les Paul Award. How cool is that?! We love Les -- another great musical monster! -- we love Les, we love you, and congratulations!""At this point, as if purposefully defying some cosmic law restricting how charming and sweet one sentient entity can become, Sir Paul blew kisses to Mr. Townshend, adding with a flourish (as only he can): ""Yeah! Oh, yeah!""And Mr. Lewis summoned one more member of the senior class of British Rock & Roll. Ladies and gentlemen, from The Rolling Stones: Sir Michael Philip Jagger! Sir Mick was also in England -- and caught in a snowstorm without access to a video crew he nonetheless penned and exported a signed missive for his old pal.  Mick Jagger [Photo © James Petrozzello]Mick Jagger's message to Pete TownshendAll this and much more, just as The Who have launched the North American leg of a very special tour, playing their 1973 masterpiece Quadrophenia in its entirety, on the brink of its 40th anniversary! (If you're a Who fan -- and if you're not, how is that possible? -- this is very good news.)Yep: a Pete Townshend love-fest. Mr. Sebastian opened the evening by reading a passage from Townshend's recently-published autobiography, Who I Am, about himself and his back-then-girlfriend Catherine: ""a stunning blonde with penetrating eyes and an amazing mouth, always smiling; she seemed too young for him."" Sebastian then good-naturedly chided Townshend: ""You know, Pete: she's still got the same lips, and the same eyes -- and she's still too young for me!""Immediately there followed a career-retrospective montage of many incarnations of Pete playing with The Who (""the original Mod band"" and ""a true force of nature"" and, hard to argue, ""one of the best bands in the world"") -- a dynamic reminder of his prowess. From tiny clubs in London to the Monterey Pop and Woodstock festivals in America, to becoming global icons, it's an amazing journey to behold, even in a tight awards-show edit. ""If The Who were successful, it was against all fucking odds,"" Pete gruffly declares therein. The montage fairly explodes with Pete's continuing solo and collaborative achievements, and suddenly here we are back with The Who again, in 2013!Brief video portrait of Pete Townshend shown during the ceremonySpake the clip's narrator: ""For his enduring work with the Who, his musical innovations at too many levels to quantify, and his generosity to benefit so many worthy causes, the TEC Foundation for Excellence in Audio is proud to present this year's Les Paul Award recipient, Pete Townshend!""Thereafter, Mr. Lewis and Les Paul Foundation trustee Jeff Salmon took the stage, the latter being heard to say ""That's when I realized, at twelve years old, that I really loved rock and roll"" -- in reflection of The Who's chaotic experience opening for The Doors in Flushing Meadows' Singer Bowl in August, 1968.Mr. Lewis is a master of public speaking. Not just at high-profile events but even at local cultural soirees. (A while back a pal invited me to attend an evening at Santa Monica High School -- where that school's orchestra was tackling the Beatles canon. And they had enlisted Mr. Lewis to emcee the concert. Lewis' observations between songs elevated what was a local school concert into a ""You Are There"" night of Fab Four lore.) At the TEC Awards, Martin warmly addressed his friend:""It's now forty years, Pete, since you and I first became acquainted, and in all those forty years of friendship, nothing has given me more pleasure, and is a greater honor, than to be able to be here tonight to say a few words about you. Mr. Lewis then presented the tributes from Mr. Townshend's peers, as noted above, and continued.""In preparing my remarks for tonight, I was thinking about that old journalistic media cliche -- it's a completely ridiculous one -- but they always refer to the fact that when you were 20 years old, you wrote a song including the lyric, 'hope I die before I get old,' and they mention, 'Oh, what is that nonsense?' -- because here you are now approaching your 93rd birthday -- in 25 years' time! And they say, 'Oh, what did that lyric mean?' I think there's another lyric that's perhaps cause for some concern, because I don't think it does express you very well. And that was the title of your very first hit: 'I Can't Explain.'""That's nonsense, Pete! You can explain, and you do explain, all the time! Brilliantly and wonderfully, and you have done, all your career! You've explained everything: teen angst; alienation; identity crisis; mid-life stress; relationships; struggles in the world; the socio-political nexus of pop-culture; auto-destruction."" After this litany Lewis paused a beat -- and then added, much to the amusement of Townshend and the entire crowd: ""and that was just in the second single!""The speeches introducing Pete Townshend""But seriously, you have explained yourself and your personal feelings, and you have articulated feelings that those of us who couldn't express it in song and music could do -- and that's what you've done all through your working career.""Mr. Lewis soon brought the evening to its focus: ""This award is named in honor of the great Les Paul. And it recognizes in you personally some of the wonderful traits that we recognize in Les Paul: your originality as a songwriter; your creativity as a musician; your skills in the recording studio; and indeed as a producer...your work in technology, especially in advancing audio and sonic quality.""And then he got to the visionary thing: ""Others had a vision of the future that was just to do with The Jetsons. Your vision of the future? In 1971 you wrote a piece wherein you envisioned the entire world joined up by computers. You called that The Grid. Now of course we call that the Internet. But what I call your vision in 1971 was visionary, and prescient!"" (Whereupon this chronicler pauses to wonder if Mr. Townshend ever read his fellow Briton H.G. Wells' 1937 essay, ""The World Brain."" Pretty cool, either way.)A crackerjack with a rock and roll anecdote, Mr. Lewis then recounted his intimate -- and very, very LOUD -- association with Marshall cabinet speakers at the 1969 premiere performance of The Who's rock opera, Tommy: ""on Thursday, the first of May, 1969, at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, in Soho, in the West End of London. In attendance were 199 British music journalists -- and one 16-year-old Who fan who gate-crashed!""The music journalists were very smart: as soon as they got inside, they went straight to the bar. The 16-year-old, not knowing what he was doing, went straight to the front of the stage, and sat down where Mr. Townshend was going to be playing, and he had this big box in front of where he was going to be, and it said: 'Marshall.'""And the 16-year-old thought, 'Well, that's probably something from America -- Marshall aid, or something.' He had no idea what it was, and sat there for the entire 90 minutes that the whole of Tommy was played -- with full explanations what each song meant, in between -- and it was just a brilliant experience.""Of course, that 16-year-old would tell you what he actually heard that night -- but his ears are still ringing!""Messrs. Lewis and Salmon then welcomed Mr. Townshend to the stage. He started by joking ""When I accepted this award, I had no idea what kind of event it would be... I had no idea how far Anaheim is from civilization on a Friday night!"" After the quips, Townshend became serious -- expressing his deep passion for the audio technology world in which his techie audience works.""I accepted to say one thing,"" declared the honoree earnestly. ""When I was 17 or 18 I got a couple of tape machines at home, and in the tradition of the great, great, great Les Paul, and a couple of other people that did the same thing, I took them into my home, and I started to use these machines to write music. And from that moment on, I waited and waited and waited, and in every single idea that I ever had, every hope that I every had for a device that would do something that I wanted it to do, you fabulous people made it for me. And I want to thank you for that.""Pete Townshend's acceptance speechMr. Townshend relished a moment for modern mirth: ""Out on the road now, with an iPad and a few bits and pieces, I'm very capable of those things as well. I just have a roadie to carry my guitars, my keyboards, my cables, my mic-stands -- and I've got it all on my iPhone!""He closed by waxing appreciative: ""Right away across the board I'm so hip to what you guys do... hip to the amount of time that you spend. And as a musician and a composer, I sincerely, sincerely, sincerely want to thank you.""Note that the TEC Awards and the Les Paul Award are no small potatoes! Past winners of the Les Paul Award include (there he is again) Sir Paul, and also such luminaries as Lindsey Buckingham, David Byrne, Peter Gabriel, Al Kooper, Steve Miller, Robbie Robertson, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Brian Wilson, Stevie Wonder (who received his award directly from Les Paul himself!), Neil Young, and Steve Vai. It's a big deal. And the TEC Awards -- executive-produced by TEC Foundation founders David Schwartz and Hillel Resner, and held annually during the NAMM show (the world's largest music-products trade fair) in Anaheim -- grow increasingly prestigious, including a Hall of Fame both for the world's audio innovators, but also for their innovations. Often referred to as the ""backstage Grammys,"" and now 28 years strong, these awards recognize excellence in the professional audio world -- without which, just about everybody would go unsung!And sing they did. The night burst into a celebration of Townshend-in-song, starting with the Who's first hit, from 1965, ""I Can't Explain,"" delivered by 19-year-old L.A. newcomer Bree Kennedy, Kennedy was backed by the event's very capable house band The 2Cold Chilibone TEC Band under the leadership of the event's Music Director, Larry Batiste. Sitting in with the band on this song was bass player Phil Chen (originally of London's ska-soul band Jimmy James & The Vagabonds -- who supported the Who in the mid-'60s!) a noted session/stage player with Jeff Beck, Rod Stewart, The Doors and of course Pete Townshend.Bree Kennedy sings ""I Can't Explain""Multiple-Grammy-winning guitarist Laurence Juber fingerpicked an amazing rendition of Townshend's 1971 ""Won't Get Fooled Again"". (Talk about intertwined history: Juber and Townshend shared a Grammy for their guitar work on Paul McCartney's ""Rockestra""). After Juber's stunning solo, the indefatigable Mr. Burdon threw down ""The Seeker"" as aforementionedLaurence Juber performs ""Won't Get Fooled Again""Eric Burdon sings ""The Seeker""Then came something inspired, a medley conceived by Mr. Lewis drawing together two related songs from Mr. Townshend's famously abandoned -then- revived-30-years-later project Lifehouse -- originally intended as the successor to his Tommy rock opera. L.A.-based British chanteuse Julia Fordham brought Mr. Townshend to his feet to applaud her interpretation of the coupling of ""The Song Is Over"" and ""Pure and Easy"" -- admirably arranged by Lewis and Batiste.Julia Fordham performs ""The Lifehouse Medley""The celebration closed with a truly glorious rendition of Townshend's 1980 Top Ten solo hit, ""Let My Love Open the Door,"" led by David Pack, formerly of Ambrosia, and featuring Burdon, Fordham and Kennedy on backing vocals and noted producer/drummer Narada Michael Walden providing thunderous drumming. And surprise-surprise! Pete Townshend leapt from table to stage and joined in on the chorus, then took a verse or two, deriving wry pleasure in the tongue-in-cheek line, ""You're so lucky I'm around!"" All to great cheers. Helluva night!The grand finale: ""Let My Love Open The Door"" - featuring a cameo appearance by the honoreeChatting backstage with Lewis prior to the award show, in an interview being taped for the TEC Foundation, Mr. Townshend discussed his admiration for Les Paul: ""I'm not as young as I look! Les and I were working at the same time to refine studio techniques.

No pop star -- not even tweet-happy, ""little-monster""mommy Lady Gaga -- attracts the kind of attention, love and hate, that Queen Bey does online. This is a performer, after all, whose iconic, Kanye West-declared-""One of the Best Videos of All Time,"" ""Single Ladies"" dance inspired a YouTube phenomenon. She's the kind of star who can walk the red carpet, put her hand over her baby bump and generate the most tweets per second (TPS) ever recorded for a single event at the time: 8,868 TPS at 10:35 p.m. on August 28, 2011 at the MTV Video Music Awards. No joke.Beyoncé will not -- absolutely, bar none, under no circumstances, not -- lip sync. She lip-synced on President Obama's second inauguration, she said in a press conference on Thursday, because she didn't feel fully prepared. She's prepared for Beyoncé Bowl. (The greatest irony of the lip-syncing-heard-round-the-world is that Beyoncé is one of those rare vocalists who actually sounds better live than she does on her recordings.)And Beyoncé, arguably the best performer of her generation, male or female, will deliver the most memorable Super Bowl halftime show we are likely to see in our lifetimes. That's not an exaggeration, especially for a singer-dancer-performer who has set the bar for everyone else. The lip-syncing controversy has generated Beyoncé even more buzz, which will hit fever pitch online by the time she takes the spotlight away from San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. (A recent poll on the cable channel Bravo asked, ""Who do you think will win the Super Bowl?"" The 49ers got 18 percent of the vote and the Ravens took 31 percent. Beyoncé won with 51 percent.)But lip-syncing and the Internet aside, you don't have to like Beyoncé's music to respect her work. You don't have to be a Beyoncé fan and a member of her Beyhive to be awestruck by her talent.BOOTYLICIOUSI've grown up listening to Beyoncé, which says less about my age (we share a birth year -- 1981) and more about how long Bey has been performing. Born in the Philippines, I moved to the U.S. in 1993, when her group Girl's Tyme changed its name to Destiny's Child. To any immigrant seeking to assimilate, the quickest way to absorb American culture -- the sounds and sights of this new country -- is through television, movies, and music. For a Filipino-American kid growing up in California in the mid-1990s, pop equaled R&B, the sounds of TLC, Boyz II Men, and Mariah Carey, the first mainstream singer to integrate rappers in her music. (There was no turning back after Ol' Dirty Bastard rapped ""Me and Mariah go back like babies and pacifiers"" in the remix of ""Fantasy."")Destiny's Child, and particularly Beyoncé, was a part of that musical education for me. Nothing quite like using ""bootylicious"" in a sentence to feel characteristically American. If Mariah was the commercial epitome of a post-Motown, modern R&B -- a hip-hop-pop sound -- then Lauryn Hill was the critical and artistic apotheosis of it. For her part, Beyoncé bridged that gap and then some, defining this singular American sound for more than a decade and attaining both commercial and critical success. As the lead singer and song-writer of Destiny's Child, a group which her own father managed, she set the pace musically and aesthetically.She declared her independence with her first solo album, Dangerously in Love, whose kinetic, genre-busting first three songs (""Crazy in Love,"" ""Naughty Girl"" and ""Baby Boy"") established her career on high gear. Before she turned 30, she was one of the best-selling female singers in the world. Along with Dolly Parton, she holds the record for the most Grammy nominations for a female artist (45) and has won 16 statues herself -- behind country's Alison Krauss, opera's Leontyne Price and the original Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, who has 18.The dancing and performing aside, her distinct yet familiar, mainstream yet idiosyncratic sound has been at the core of her appeal.B'Day Who sounds like Beyoncé?No one.Bey's sound is expansive in its reach, encyclopedic in its references, ""like Broadway meets the jump rope game in Brooklyn,"" ""Halo"" then the soul and blues of ""I'd Rather Go Blind,"" then the scat-filled, jazz-like rendering of ""Deja Vu,"" then the rap-sing syncopated, ""A Milli""-like groove of that out-Minajs even Nicki herself. (Or, for that matter, just compare her take on Tina's ""Proud Mary"" to her reading of Barbra's ""The Way We Were."")Who else but Beyoncé could have given us the eclectic and eccentric ""Countdown""?Among female singers, Beyoncé's how-does-she-do-that virtuosity is only matched by Audra McDonald, the five-time Tony Award-winning Broadway star. (Interesting side-note: Beyoncé and Audra have both played Deena Jones, the prim-and-proper, Diana Ross-like character in Dreamgirls. With varying success and obvious strain, you can almost hear their cords fighting to get out of that vocal straightjacket. No wonder Beyoncé recorded the bombastic songs of B'Day -- from ""Get Me Bodied"" to ""Freakum Dress"" -- shortly after filming Dreamgirls. )Two of the most perceptive critics of Beyoncé's oeuvre -- Jody Rosen, who's written for Entertainment Weekly and Rolling Stone, and Sasha Frere-Jones, the pop music critic of the New Yorker -- have run out of superlatives to describe Bey's sound. ""You'd have to search far and wide -- perhaps in the halls of the Metropolitan Opera -- to find a vocalist who sings with more sheer force,"" Rosen writes in his review of B'Day. For her third album, the less musically impressive if not more commercially successful ""I Am... Sasha Fierce,"" the headline of Frere-Jones' review summed up his verdict: ""The Queen."" Beyoncé is ""pop's A student,"" Frere-Jones writes, ""a strange and brilliant musician"" on her way to the Genius Lounge that's crowded by ""the moody, the male, and the dead.""And Queen Bey is most definitely alive, dancing with the kind of jubilance and enraptured energy that often masks the difficulty of her enterprise. On stage, she's like a tall can of Red Bull served over ice, always lit from within, a sprint runner in search of a marathon. Through her dances, lyrics and music, she exemplifies a kind of female empowerment that is at once accessible and mysterious. How does she do it? We don't know. She's Beyoncé.RUN THE WORLDBeyond Beyoncé the performer, however, there's Beyoncé the global celebrity, with a carefully crafted image that she has honed for over a decade. She's a professional who can be a homebody, akin to the business executive-turned-first lady Michelle Obama, whom Beyoncé has repeatedly praised. She's an entrepreneur with an expanding brand, a young Oprah for the 21st century: a clothing line, a production company, endorsement deals -- hello Pepsi. While Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, advises women to ""Lean In,"" the title of her new book, Beyoncé idealistically tells girls that they can ""run the world."" It's that hard-working, hard-charging personal narrative that now powers her upcoming HBO documentary, written, produced, and directed by, of course, Beyoncé. In the age of Katy Perry and Rihanna, her (somewhat) contemporaries, Beyoncé has rarely misstepped. She's the glamorous yet down-to-earth girl next door, the elder sister to Taylor Swift, and the one Adele grew up idolizing. She can duet with Gaga, Alicia Keys, and Shakira, all different artists with different visions, but more than hold her own. No wonder she ended marrying Jay-Z, making her possibly the only woman who can, literally, figuratively, and musically, ""upgrade"" him. The woman has got swag.In a relatively open and honest interview with GQ -- in the past Beyoncé has taken ""guarded"" to a whole new level -- Queen Bey, with little trace of self-awareness, says: ""I now know that, yes, I am powerful. I'm more powerful than my mind can even digest and understand.""More than any other pop star, Bey has made a business out of being perfect in an imperfect world. That's why the lip-syncing controversy made headlines the way it did -- Beyoncé, faking the perfection? And that is precisely the tension that will keep watching Beyoncé so thrilling. The tension between her studied, choreographed, hard-earned perfection and the surprising, liberating abandon of a continually evolving artist striving to be authentically herself. Nobody is that perfect, not even Beyoncé, but for her sake and ours, she sure will keep trying.What's next? Her own record company? A Broadway show, an original one-woman musical that traces the genesis of the black female performer, from Diana Sands and Josephine Baker to Whitney Houston? More albums, more acting, more concerts?The answer is, the possibilities seem limitless. The struggle for perfection continues.She is, after all, only 31 years old.

And that's the big difference.""She includes a familiar request for Cuomo: ""Please meet us."" Ono, fellow artists, and journalists (myself included) got a first-hand look last month at what may be at stake with Cuomo's looming decision. The video chronicles our bus tour of northeastern Pennsylvania, a region that's already accrued years of experience with natural gas operations.Of course, New York is not the only state contemplating whether or not to tap into its large volumes of shale gas -- nor is the U.S. the only country on the verge of such a monumental choice. ""It would be so incredible if we can do something in the state of New York,"" says Ono in the video. ""That might just create a precedent.""People in favor of expanding natural gas production have shared with me their frustrations with anti-fracking activists, who they say are using ""radical scare tactics"" to thwart what could be a welcome boon for the country, as well as for struggling families and small businesses.

So when a female is ready, males are excited and there is a lot of competition.",2013-02-03,"Photo made on December 30, 2012 shows elephants at the Amboseli game reserve, approximately 250 kilometres south of Kenyan capital Nairobi. Drawing to its close today, this year 2012, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare, IFAW, stands out as the ''annus horriblis'' (Latin for 'year of horrors') for the World's largest land mammal with statistics standing at 34 tonnes of poached ivory having been seized, marking the biggest ever total of confiscated ivory in a single year, outstripping by almost 40 per cent last year’s record of 24.3 tonnes. Earlier this year, in just six weeks, between January and March 2012, at least 50 per cent of the elephants in Cameroon’s Bouba Ndjida National Park were slaughtered for their ivory by horseback bandits. Most illegal ivory is destined for Asia, in particular China, where it has soared in value as an investment vehicle and coveted as “white gold.” AFP PHOTO/Tony KARUMBA (Photo credit should read TONY KARUMBA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb131a02600003600817a37.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I watched wild elephants mating today. I don't know about you, but -- first time for me.  I'm in Kenya working on a new book about the lives of animals.Elephants have a unique mating system. First of all, females live together in families: a matriarch, her grown daughters, and all their kids. Males live in loose groups of males, or wander around on their own. Males don't live in families. Males don't usually start trying to breed until they're in their 20s. A weird thing happens. Older, higher ranking males, usually at least in their 30s, go into a period of heightened sexual appetite and aggressiveness called ""musthe."" Male elephants in musthe are a little like male deer in ""rut."" But deer all come into breeding readiness at the same time. With elephants, there is no way to predict which males will be in musthe or when. Males not in musthe would happily mate. But musthe males are bossy and aggressive, and -- females prefer them.Females mature around age 13, and then go into estrus for about three or four days. Almost every time they go into estrus, they conceive. They are pregnant for two years. About two years after giving birth, they go into estrus again, then they are pregnant for two more years while still nursing the last calf. (If they have a surviving baby, they keep nursing it for about four years.) In other words, they are ready to mate for only about three to four days every four to five years.So when a female is ready, males are excited and there is a lot of competition.Males in musthe walk around visiting different families, streaming fluid from the glands at the temples that both sexes have. (Both sexes stream from those glands when there is heightened emotion or excitement of any kind -- a little like having sweating armpits on the side of your face, I guess). They also dribble urine constantly which broadcasts their status -- you can smell it; it smells a bit like cat pee -- and their penis appears greenish. Researchers only figured this all out for African elephants in the 1970s. At first they thought the males were sick; they were calling the whole event, which can last a few weeks, ""green penis disease.""So, the musthe males go all around sniffing the air and sniffing the herds for estrus females. They walk up to adult females and instead of saying, ""What's your sign?,"" they touch their trunk tip to her vulva, have a sniff, and often put the trunk into their mouths to test the taste. This forward familiarity disturbs the ladies not in the least and they take it literally in stride, walking or feeding the whole time as if nothing is going on. Elephants are in many ways like humans, but there are limits to the comparison. Or at least, to the etiquette.If a female is in estrus, various males will follow her and her family along. If a ""musthe bull"" arrives he will bully all rivals away and guard the estrus female. She will seem to be quite attracted to the musthe bull. Now, today, it turned out that a musthe bull and several other bulls showed up among some ladies we were watching. Two families called the Zodiacs and the Rivers were mingling. Mingling families are called ""bond groups"" and are often relatives from families that have grown and split over decades of time.Anyway, by watching the males we eventually realized that both Taurus Zodiac and Yangtze Rivers were in estrus. I know their names because I'm staying at the Save the Elephants field camp, and graduate student Shifra Goldenberg can recognize hundreds of elephants by sight.First, a male called Bigfoot started chasing Taurus. Usually the game is that if a suitably grown-up bull catches up to a female in estrus and lays his trunk along her back, she stops and they mate. But Taurus must be just coming into estrus and didn't seem ready. Or maybe she just didn't want to mate with Bigfoot. When Bigfoot caught up to her and laid his trunk along her back, fair and square, she kept running. He was not pleased, and he came running alongside and looked like he was going to shove her with his tusks. But instead, he just roared in frustration, and broke off the chase. Then Suzuki chased Taurus, with exactly the same response and result.Then a musthe bull, who doesn't seem to be in the database of known bulls, chased both those males away. There were about a dozen bulls around, all told, and all the females and bulls were all excited and running around and trumpeting. It's called, ""mating pandemonium.""The boys got so carried away, they lost track of Taurus, whom I last saw traveling east. They all put their trunks up like periscopes, ""looking"" for the scent.It was only then that we realized that Yangtze was also in estrus. The unknown musthe bull caught up to her and she let him mount.  Photo by Shifra GoldenbergEveryone seemed to get very quiet. The other bulls looked on in awe, transfixed. Mating lasted about two minutes.After that, everyone calmed down and got back to resting -- they must have exerted a lot of energy running around in the tropical noonday heat -- and eating.And we left, knowing that this excitement will be going on repeatedly for a few days."

For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships in his way.  For is this done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant quickness.  For then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of God upon his prayer.  For he rolls upon prank to work it in.  For having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider himself.  For this he performs in ten degrees.  For first he looks upon his forepaws to see if they are clean.  For secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there.  For thirdly he works it upon stretch with the forepaws extended.  For fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood.  For fifthly he washes himself.  For sixthly he rolls upon wash.  For seventhly he fleas himself, that he may not be interrupted upon the beat.  For eighthly he rubs himself against a post.  For ninthly he looks up for his instructions.  For tenthly he goes in quest of food.  For having considered God and himself he will consider his neighbor.  For if he meets another cat he will kiss her in kindness.  For when he takes his prey he plays with it to give it a chance.  For one mouse in seven escapes by his dallying.  For when his day's work is done his business more properly begins.  For he keeps the Lord's watch in the night against the adversary.  For he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes.  For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the life.  For in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves him.  For he is of the tribe of Tiger.   That last line segues naturally to William Blake, who famously captured the darker side of cats in his poem ""The Tyger"" from Songs of Innocence and Experience. In sharp contrast to the nursery rhyme quality of the poem's innocent companion, ""The Lamb,"" the poem's aggressive meter drives forward like a blacksmith's hammer. Tyger! Tyger! burning bright  In the forests of the night,  What immortal hand or eye  Could frame thy fearful symmetry? In what distant deeps or skies  Burnt the fire of thine eyes?  On what wings dare he aspire?  What the hand dare seize the fire? And what shoulder, & what art.  Could twist the sinews of thy heart?  And when thy heart began to beat,  What dread hand? & what dread feet? What the hammer? what the chain?  In what furnace was thy brain?  What the anvil? what dread grasp  Dare its deadly terrors clasp? When the stars threw down their spears,  And watered heaven with their tears,  Did he smile his work to see?  Did he who made the Lamb make thee? Tyger! Tyger! burning bright  In the forests of the night,  What immortal hand or eye  Dare frame thy fearful symmetry? My favorite animal poem is probably D.H. Lawrence's classic ""The Elephant is Slow to Mate."" It captures the heart of the beasts, and does so with what seems to be intense compassion, describing how they... sleep in massive silence, and wake  together, without a word. So slowly the great hot elephant hearts  grow full of desire, This being Lawrence, you shouldn't be surprised that the elephants culminate (eventually) their passions: They do not snatch, they do not tear;  their massive blood moves as the moon-tides, near, more near  till they touch in flood.As with Lawrence, Ted Hughes moves far beyond physical description in his poem ""Pike."" Speaking about the poem, he told the Poetry Archive: ""I captured not just a pike, I captured the whole pond including the monsters I never even hooked."" The poem starts with a simple portrait:Pike, three inches long, perfect Pike in all parts, green tigering the gold.but expands to encompass so much more. For Hughes, the fish becomesThe dream Darkness beneath night's darkness had freed, That rose slowly towards me, watching.You can (and should!) read more of Hughes' outstanding animal poetry here.

I'm a 49ers fan but how can I not root for the Ravens? (There is a ""murder of crows,"" ""a storytelling of ravens"" and ""an unkindness of ravens"" -- look out, 49ers!). I am thinking of an all-star poetry team, beginning with Emily Dickinson as wide receiver: ""The spreading wide my narrow hands to gather paradise."" She's speedy, she's deft, she's elusive: ""The spider holds a silver ball in unperceived hands."" (Heavyweights ""fumble at my spirit ... As players at the keys/ Before they drop full music on""). She knows victory. She knows defeat. There's the line. And then there's the line. Poets put it on the line. So let's scout out a team. Here's what I'm thinking so far for our Super Bowl. The Coach: Ralph Waldo Emerson calls for ""The Poet."" He lays out what needs to be done. He's the old school Vince Lombardi. ""Those who are esteemed umpires of taste ... Their knowledge of the fine arts is some study of rules and particulars... exercised for amusement or for show ... We were put into our bodies, as fire is put into a pan, to be carried about.""And he's going to lay out for us his vision of what needs to be done.""The poet is the sayer, the namer, and represents beauty. He is a sovereign, and stands on the centre...""QB: What about Alfred, Lord Tennyson? In ""Ulysses,"" a leader who rallies his crew when everyone has given up on him as a has-been. He's ""become a name,"" a celebrity, who has ""drunk delight of battle with my peers,"" and he wants to be back in the action. He exhorts his whole team to get moving, and not only that, but to pick up the pace. He's the Chip Kelly recruit, up tempo: ""How dull it is to pause, to make an end/To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!"" Yes, there is the inevitable pile up -- ""Life piled on life were all too little."" But ""I cannot rest from travel."" He loves to ""roam"" with a ""hungry heart,"" and he addresses his team:""My mariners, Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me -- something ere the end/Some work of noble note, may yet be done/Not unbecoming men that strove with gods."" And he addresses them, ""Come, my friends. 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world/Push off, and sitting well in order smite the sounding furrows."" He will give a strong locker room speech before going out on the field: ""One equal temper of heroic hearts/Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will/To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."" Go team! Jack Collum could be our color, for his poem ""Ecology,"" and so many of our poets today are wonderful readers of one another's work, in our time and times past ... I need to think of our wealth of commentators who bring poetry alive to us, ""despised"" and ""difficult"" as poetry seems (William Carlos Williams). Our nation loves poetry: it's our bedrock of how we think as citizens and alone, in love and lonely, how we celebrate, how we mourn, how we heal, how we hope. If we can see poetry illuminated by football, an activity that absorbs our rapt attention, half mystery, half spectacle -- what's going on? What's happening? There's an order there, but it's complicated and dynamic and we have to slow it down, we need the color, the commentary, the criticism play by play -- we can understand our human predicament and fate and possibility within the mind's ordered sense of time. We gather to watch struggle, achievement, and each of us is carrying that ball when the runner breaks free, when the poet's language liberates our thought ... What exactly is the ball, Archibald Macleish? And how does one succeed? Or is the game the poem itself, the poet both offense and defense, trying to create meaning against the forces of conventional thought and all the pressures trying to stop one's flow? Is carrying the ball the metaphor, the velocity of meaning, the urgency and power of message, imaginative force against darkness of Cummings' ""the no of all nothing""? Is what we battle are the voices saying who do you think you are, who are you to make something that was not there before, is not needed, is not called for? But wait, here is our coach Emerson, calling for you to do this work: making something that was not there before, that changes or more accurately, validates our world? And what do we eat, when we write or read a poem? For movies, we know: it's popcorn and in my case, Junior Mints, for tailgate parties, is it barbeque? Well, we're going to have recipes for a poetry tailgate, poets on food to nourish our spirits... haggis if you like, or Pablo Nerudian fried potatoes, or Dickinson gingerbread, or Eliot toast and tea, or Ferglingetti penny candy, or recipe for happiness, or Baudelaurian wine, or Williams' plums or Elizabeth Alexander butter...  We have a ""roster of"" poets for Pre-Game and post-game, and of course a referee (Dante, no?) So far I have gotten advice from my scouts across the U.S.: Aristophanes for ""the trick play,"" Kim Addonizio and Dorianne Laux for ""rough and tumble,"" Dr. Seuss who can ""pinch hit when there's a bit of a snit,"" Dorothy Parker on defense, T.S. Eliot as offensive coordinator, and Bukowski as inebriation fan! More anon... we'll talk about this on The Poetry Slow Down Sunday, pre-gaming, KRXA 540AM, PST Noon-1 p.m. (Podcast: BarbaraMossberg.com). I'm looking forward to more suggestions for our roster!"

The 62nd Berlinale, the first major European film festival of the year, kicked off on February 10, 2012, with 23 productions screening in the main showcase.

Opening a message from my good friend Dave Guenette (label manager at Pirates Blend, past manager of Zaki Ibrahim & Bedouin Soundclash, past tour manager of K'Naan etc.) is like opening a loot bag from a friend with good taste -- it's always a welcome and unexpected surprise. To give you a flavour, back in 2007, Dave hits me with Sol Guy (co-creator of 4REAL, Canadian music visionary, master connector and at the time K'Naan's manager) on copy saying: 'Hey che, can you go down to Tuff Gong Studios in Jamaica and deliver some things to K'Naan.' That little trip ended up having me witness the recording of K'Naan's Troubadour album -- with tracks like ABC's and the global hit, Waving Flag -- as well as photographing Bob's 60th birthday with Rita Marley and Danny Glover at his home turned museum -- 56 Hope Road. It also led to me meeting all of my people in Kingston, sparking the connections that would eventually give birth to Manifesto Jamaica, the sister organization to the Toronto based Manifesto Community Projects.Needless to say, I like getting mail from Dave. In June 2012, I now get a message with Dave on copy. It's from one of my mentors Jonathan Ramos -- director of Union Events, who is working on a Saul William concert at the Great Hall -- a classic Toronto venue. Time has progressed since Dave and I last caught up - he is now Saul Williams' manager and wants to reconnect and get us at Manifesto involved in the show. This kind of collaboration is very special, working with such a prolific and profound artist, so we all decide to link up for some tea and discuss visions.  Saul Williams - Photo by Che KothariSaul is a unique human being. Not every artist can get the type of co-signs from all ends of the spectrum that he does. Regarding Saul's energy, Nas commented, 'He is every kind of great artist combined into one. A brilliant, brilliant guy.' After CNN dubbed Saul 'hip hop's poet laureate,' the Washington Post wrote of the genre bending artist, 'An astonishing performance poet. The internal rhyme, metrics and imagery are so fleet in the way they clarify contemporary ghetto experience that they're humbling.' Somewhere in the middle, Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons says, 'He's a profound poet who inspires us. He challenges us to be individuals.' Saul Williams - Photo by Che KothariAlright, so we know Saul is full of magic, but how do we go beyond the quotes and a performance (his performances are one of a kind experience and highly recommended) and get in conversation with Saul? We go full circle and bring Sol Guy back into the mix, Saul's long time friend and the original connect between Dave G and Saul W (yes, it helps that they share the same name, just spelled differently). So on September 4th, 2012, Sol Guy interviews Saul Williams in an intimate setting at the Manifesto HQ's with 75 carefully selected artists and organizers in attendance, before heading to the venue to perform alongside some amazing Toronto talent. This is the one hour long convo which was documented for our, and generations to come, collective enlightenment:In Conversation with...
