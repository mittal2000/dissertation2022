1,POLITICS,Jeb Bush To Visit Crisis Pregnancy Center,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb-bush-to-visit-crisis-pregnancy-center_us_55ae8335e4b0a9b94852a64c,The nonprofit organizations preach abstinence and push against abortions.,2015-07-21,"<p>Jeb Bush plans to visit a crisis pregnancy center in Spartanburg, South Carolina, on Wednesday.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ae8d961500002d00173c28.jpeg?ops=crop_30_221_2970_1521%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) will visit a South Carolina crisis pregnancy center on Wednesday as part of his campaign tour through the Palmetto State. Crisis pregnancy centers are nonprofit organizations with a mission to deter pregnant women from choosing abortion, sometimes by providing misinformation about the procedure and about birth control.Bush is scheduled to visit the Carolina Pregnancy Center in Spartanburg on Wednesday morning. The presidential candidate boasted earlier this year that Florida was the only state to have funneled public money into CPCs. In 2005, Bush began a $2-million-a-year program that paid 100 centers in Florida to promote ""life-affirming choices"" to women. ""We’re the only state, I believe, to have funded with state monies crisis pregnancy centers to provide counselors so that these not-for-profits … could act on their mission,"" Bush said in an interview with Focus on the Family. ""It was a godsend for these crisis pregnancy centers and a lot of babies’ lives were saved."" CPCs preach abstinence instead of safe sex and are known to provide women misleading statistics about the links between abortion and breast cancer and depression.A 2013 investigation by NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, a state chapter of the national abortion rights group, found that counselors at CPCs across Virginia were also telling women that condoms were not effective at preventing pregnancy because they are ""naturally porous"" and that birth control pills frequently cause hair loss, memory loss and breast cancer. In fact, studies have shown that having an abortion does not lead to depression, there is no causal relationship between induced abortion and breast cancer, condoms are 98 percent effective at preventing pregnancy and only high-dose estrogen birth control pills have been linked to a higher risk of breast cancer. Bush's support for CPCs is not surprising, as he opposes legal abortion except in cases of rape and incest and said in 2003 that he is the ""most anti-abortion governor in modern times."" A spokesperson for his campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "

Smith's Best Work Is A New Lil Wayne Album, According To Math",Justin Block,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-secret-to-unlocking-jr-smiths-best-is-in-friends-music_us_55ae5808e4b07af29d56551d,"""I get by with a little help from my friends.""",2015-07-21,"<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; background-color: #eeeeee;"">J.R. Smith flashes his Young Money chain in the ""Bed Rock"" video.</span></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ae6a591800003d0037664c.gif?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Known as one of the NBA's streakiest and most confounding players, J.R. Smith has one thing in this world that can truly bring out his absolute best. It's not the leadership of Cleveland Cavaliers teammate LeBron James or the friendship of former New York Knicks teammate Carmelo Anthony. No, no.It's the music of his good friend Lil Wayne. Thanks to new data collected by Kenny Ducey of Hashtag Important, we now know that the classic Beatles line, ""I get by with a little help from my friends,"" applies to J.R. and Weezy in a previously unforeseen light. J.R., whose career scoring average through 11 seasons is 13.2 PPG on 42 percent shooting, sees those numbers increase to 19.5 PPG on 49 percent shooting on the day following a Lil Wayne album or mixtape release, the bulletproof analysis discovered. J.R. Smith's stats are much better following a Lil Wayne album release.The trend goes back to 2005, when J.R. was a second-year player for the New Orleans Hornets. Lil Wayne is, of course, a New Orleans native and the pair have been friends since J.R. was drafted by the Hornets out of high school in 2004. Lil Wayne has gone on to win four Grammy's and J.R. won Sixth Man of the Year in 2013. Their careers have grown since their early New Orleans days, but their friendship has remained tight, statistically speaking.In November 2009, J.R., in a show of permanent loyalty, got the logo for Lil Wayne's record label tattooed across his neck. A month later, before ""We Are Young Money"" was released, J.R. popped up for a split-second in Lil Wayne's video for ""Bed Rock."" J.R. Smith flashes his Young Money chain in the ""Bed Rock"" video.  The day after ""We Are Young Money"" dropped, J.R. went off for 41 points and 10 three-pointers against the Atlanta Hawks. Through thick and thin, they've remained close, working off each other in the pursuit of greatness in all things basketball and hip-hop. More importantly: They've got each other's backs. The night before Lil Wayne began his prison sentence in February 2010 for gun charges, J.R., an unofficial ""Young Money Athlete,"" called to make sure he was OK. Lil Wayne followed-up by lovingly shouting out J.R. on his Dedication 5 song appropriately titled, ""Luv."" These two will be friends forever.  If J.R.'s next head coach (he's currently a free agent after declining the player option on his contract with the Cavaliers) wants to get the best out of his mercurial shooter, he should be pounding on Lil Wayne's door to get the rapper's shelved album, ""Tha Carter V,"" released during the 2016 playoffs. The confluence of hearty friendship and good music is the only way to trigger J.R. Smith's best work. Also on HuffPost"
3,RELIGION,5 Faith Facts About Gov. John Kasich: 'God Is With Me Wherever I Happen To Be',"Cathy Lynn Grossman, Religion News Service",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kasich-faith_us_55ae901ee4b07af29d568b09,"(RNS) Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich, a former altar boy who grew up to be an abortion opponent who backs the death penalty",2015-07-21,"COLUMBUS, OHIO - JULY 21: Ohio Governor John Kasich gives his speech announcing his 2016 Presidential candidacy at the Ohio Student Union, at The Ohio State University on July 21, 2016 in Columbus, Ohio. Kasich became the 16th candidate to officially enter the race for the Republican presidential nomination. (Photo by Ty Wright/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ae93d21200002c0013ae23.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich, a former altar boy who grew up to be an abortion opponent who backs the death penalty, is expected to throw his hat in the 2016 presidential race on Tuesday (July 21).Here are five faith facts about Kasich:1. He started out Catholic, and the faith is “always going to be a part of me.”In one of his two books about faith, values and politics, Kasich, 63, describes growing up as “a card-carrying Catholic” child of immigrants in “working-class church-abiding” McKees Rocks, Pa.Kasich writes: “I drifted away from religion as a young adult. Then I looked up one day, and there was a huge hole in my life where God and religion had been.”He turned back to faith after his parents were killed by a drunken driver. His 2010 book, “Every Other Monday,” gets its name from the biweekly Bible study he’s attended for two decades.The book was panned by Publishers Weekly, which called Kasich’s approach to Scripture “therapeutic” and concluded, “The Christianity that emerges from these pages is tame and has nothing profound to say.”2. He “doesn’t find God in church.”Instead, Kasich writes: “He’s with me wherever I happen to be. I go to church because that’s what you do. I find God in the stories of the Bible, in the random acts of kindness I see every day, in the choices I make and the ways I interact.”But he does belong to a church — St. Augustine in Westerville, Ohio, part of the conservative splinter group the Anglican Church in North America. The denomination broke away from the Episcopal Church after that denomination consecrated an openly gay bishop. The ACNA does not permit female bishops or ordain LGBT priests.3. The Bible resonates with him.“Greed and charity, ruin and redemption, misery and hope. It’s all right there. It’s accessible, and at the same time it’s beyond knowing, and I can’t for the life of me figure how anyone gets along without it,” he wrote in his 2006 book, “Stand for Something.”In “Every Other Monday,” he describes taking Scripture word for word: “I believe there was indeed an ark — and not just any ark but an impossibly, unfathomably huge ark — and that Noah undertook this impossibly, unfathomably huge task and completed it heroically.”4. He’s not afraid to lob Scripture at critics.The Columbus Dispatch, covering his 2014 re-election campaign, noted that he “cites God regularly,” as when he justified the expansion of Medicaid to more than a quarter-million Ohioans.Indeed, he felt free to stand up for that Medicaid expansion in a conference room full of Republican mega-donors last year. According to Politico, Randy Kendrick, a major donor whose husband owns the Arizona Diamondbacks, questioned the decision and Kasich’s God-based rationale.Politico writes: “The governor’s response was fiery. ‘I don’t know about you, lady,’ he said as he pointed at Kendrick, his voice rising. ‘But when I get to the pearly gates, I’m going to have an answer for what I’ve done for the poor.'”5. Gay marriage? Time to “move on,” says Kasich.Kasich voted for the Defense of Marriage Act years ago and supported Ohio’s ban on gay marriage. But he was pragmatic after the Supreme Court ruling June 26 overturned state bans. Two days later, he was interviewed on “Face the Nation” and said: “I believe in traditional marriage, but the Supreme Court has ruled. It’s the law of the land, and we’ll abide by it. … It’s time to move on.”He then called for conservatives to refocus on other urgent issues, such as jobs, national defense and “healing the division between races.”Also on HuffPost:"

Speaking to BBC Radio's Test Match Special, the director explained that the intense process of making a Bond film isn't something he could go through too many times. ""I said no to the last one and then ended up doing it, and was pilloried by all my friends,"" he said. ""But I do think this is probably it.""""I don't think I could go down that road again,"" he continued. ""You do have to put everything else on hold.""Mendes, who also directed 2012's ""Skyfall,"" revealed both films took a combined total of five years to make. ""It feels almost, even though we've just finished shooting it, like one big experience and it was a fantastic life-changing thing,"" he said. ""It really is more a lifestyle choice than a job.""""Spectre"" was filmed in London, Mexico, Italy and Morocco with a cast and crew of over 1,000 people. The film features Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Andrew Scott, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci, and, of course, Daniel Craig, who will reprise his role as James Bond.
