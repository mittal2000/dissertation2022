0,ENTERTAINMENT,The Moment Scarlett Johansson Knew She Wanted To Be An Actress,Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scarlett-johansson-lucy-hollywood_n_5596664.html,,2014-07-21,"LONDON, ENGLAND - MARCH 20: Scarlett Johansson attends the UK Film Premiere of 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' at Westfield London on March 20, 2014 in London, England. (Photo by Anthony Harvey/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4695f24000031009793ef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Scarlett Johansson has been in the film business for 20 years, making her big debut at the age of nine as John Ritter's daughter in the 1994 movie, ""North."" She then went on to star in ""Manny & Lo,"" ""The Horse Whisperer"" and ""Ghost World,"" before nabbing her breakout role in Sofia Coppola's 2003 film, ""Lost in Translation,"" for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Now 29, Johansson has expanded her resume, appearing in movies that range from rom-coms to action-adventure. And speaking of those latter features, Johansson has slowly taken on the title of the ""it-girl"" when it comes to playing strong (ahem, kick-ass) female characters. After starring in a handful of Woody Allen films, Johansson put her husky voice to good use once again as she took on the iconic role of Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, proving that she's perfectly fit to play a superhero. Her latest performance in ""Lucy"" also sets her up for world domination. In the action-drama -- directed, written and edited by Luc Besson, the visual guru behind ""The Fifth Element"" -- Johansson goes from your average Joe to superhuman after a drug implanted in her body by the mob accidentally leaks into her system, allowing her to use more than the normal 10 percent of her brain's capacity. (Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds).Johansson spoke with HuffPost Entertainment about this unique character, her career and the rumors surrounding her role in the latest Coen Brothers movie, ""Hail, Caesar!"" What drew you to playing this role in “Lucy”?  I first met Luc when the script was sort of a work in progress. I was doing a play in New York at the time and Luc had come to see it. Normally, I probably wouldn’t have taken a meeting while I was doing a play -- just because it’s so hard to think about the next project while I’m already on one -- but I was really interested to hear what he was doing next as a director. And he really came with this passion for his project that he’s been developing for 10 years. I think he needed to meet with me to sort of describe the story and his vision for it because it’s pretty abstract. Even reading the eventual script, it was pretty sparse. It was accompanied by a huge visual dictionary of sorts that he had put together because I needed those references to know exactly what he was imagining. This project is a conceptual one, maybe even more so than some of his previous work, it’s really coming from his visual kind of world that he’s known for and that he lives in. I guess it was the challenge of the project itself that drew me into it. It was me having to put trust in Luc and him having, in turn, put trust in me. We had to weed each other into finding the core of the character and the story.  Johansson in 2014's ""Lucy.""I saw the movie and, yes, it’s abstract in many different ways. There are so many visual effects, which I’m sure you’re used to working with in the Marvel movies, but how did you get in character for all those scenes that would eventually be dominated by visuals?  I guess as an actor you’re not always reacting to things that are right in front of you or that are really tangible. Sometimes you’re already kind of existing or free-floating in a story that you’ve constructed for yourself and the character. I mean, it’s always nice to have the actual tangible thing to react to, but you’re already coming from a place that doesn’t really exist. Your emotions are there for what you created for the character, but it’s a “make believe world,"" in a sense -- that’s a silly way of saying it, but it’s true. And I think the next step in that is [realizing] it doesn’t really matter what you have in front of you, or whether the things are real or not, because you’re in the reality of the emotion that you created. And, of course, more and more actors get to channel some level of imagination because there is so much production work in movies now. But I wouldn’t say it’s more challenging than doing an improv class where you don’t have all these physical tools. It’s part of being in the moment, I guess, and you trust your instinct about something and it appears! [laughs]This year you had “Under the Skin,” “Captain America 2” and “Lucy,” and “Avengers: Age of Ultron” is currently filming. Have you enjoyed playing these strong, kick-ass female characters? Is that, sort of, your “thing” now? Because, hey, you’re very good at it! Oh, thank you! Those characters are so different, of course. My experience shooting “Under the Skin” was so different than playing Black Widow in “Captain America 2” or “Avengers” and doing “Lucy” brought its own sort of challenges. The character of Black Widow is a person with a history. She’s someone who’s hardened and flawed and she’s a superhero with quite a complex emotional vocabulary. And Laura in “Under the Skin” is not a person at all -- she’s a different species and there’s no vocabulary for the emotion that she feels because she doesn’t have any feelings that we can, at all, relate to. She’s walking around with a different set of very primal instincts. And in “Lucy,” the character’s challenge is that she’s in a constant state of transition. At any given moment, something extraordinary is happening inside of her and she’s having this incredible insight, but it’s a constant change. So what’s she’s desperately holding onto is any kind of remnants of the person that she was that she can still connect back to humanity in some way. So all the characters of those films, they’re different, but they are all sort of survivors, I guess in a way. Maybe that’s what you mean by strong -- they have a drive for a specific purpose, and it’s kind of a selfless one. If you find a purpose in the character that you’re playing, that’s the key. I look for a character that has some purpose as apposed to can this character kick ass -- although, that’s nice too! That comes with it, I guess.  Johansson in 2014's ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier.""“Horse Whisperer,” “Lost in Translation,” “Match Point,” “The Other Boleyn Girl,” “He’s Just Not That Into You” -- you’ve been in so many genres of movies and played so many roles. Is there any specific film, character or experience you can remember where you thought, “Wow, I want to be an actress for the rest of my life”?  It’s hard to say because I’ve been working for 20 years and that has changed over different periods of time. Like, when you have more choices in the work that you’re doing, you understand why you’re doing what you do -- it’s clearer to you. But then, there are other times where you might struggle to find the work that you connect to and you can question your purpose as an actor, like, “Why am I doing this? What am I looking for? What work would be satisfying to me? What does this job mean?” And then all of the sudden you’ll have some breakthrough -- a challenging role that really inspires you -- and you say, “Hey, this is why I’m an actor! I love my job! I feel fulfilled.” I think every artist has a career that sort of flows in that way. Mine, I’ve had those kind of moments of profound satisfaction at different points. Certainly doing theater has excited me and fueled my drive, my passion and my curiosity for what I do. When I did “A View from the Bridge,” it came at such a wonderful time and it was kind of perfectly placed in my life and in my career -- I needed that challenge to help me understand myself better as an actor. And that’s happened at various times over 20 years. It would be hard to pinpoint a specific one. Even doing “Girl with a Pearl Earring” when I was 18 was such a wonderful experience for me. Shooting that and having the ability to work in such a quiet and nuanced way, I felt very deeply connected to that project. And at that time they were still using film and camera and you could hear and enrich the experience. So, there have been different challenges along the way that have reignited that flame that I have for what I do.  Johansson in 2003's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring.""Speaking of career-defining moments, there are rumors floating around that you are going to be in “Hail, Caesar!” -- the new Coen brothers movie. Can you speak to that?  No, not really, but I know the project and I think there are talks of working that out! I would love to be able to work with the Coen brothers again -- it’s been a decade or more [since ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" in 2001] -- and I’m always grateful for the opportunity to collaborate time and again with someone. I see that as a compliment. And it’s another opportunity to try and get it right, so hopefully that will come true, that will happen. ""Lucy"" hits theaters July 25.

1,RELIGION,Religious Freedom On My Mind,"Rev. Dr. Nancy Wilson, ContributorActivist, Speaker, Author, Pastor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/religious-freedom-on-my-m_b_5599946.html,It is time to blow the whistle on religious demagogues who say they are victims if they are not allowed to take away the rights of others.,2014-07-21,"Customers walk to a Hobby Lobby store in Oklahoma City, Monday, June 30, 2014. The Supreme Court ruled Monday that employers can hold religious objections that allow them to opt out of the new health law requirement that they cover contraceptives for women. The Hobby Lobby chain of arts-and-crafts stores is by far the largest employer of any company that has gone to court to fight the birth control provision. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7eb7a3c000018010daeef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Religious freedom is on my mind. In late June, the Supreme Court decided that Hobby Lobby and other ""closely held"" for-profit corporations can now claim religion as a reason to discriminate against women. Citing ""sincerely held beliefs"" of the owners, the Supreme Court put many women and their health at the mercy of the religious beliefs of their employers.Suddenly, those of us who have been fighting for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people realized that we have allowed almost all marriage equality laws to include religious exemptions.Most of us opined that religious liberty was already built into the Constitution, so what harm would come from reiterating this freedom in these legislative actions if it would win approval by legislatures? Many times, the legislation hinged on just a few votes so it seemed expedient.Now, we realize religious exemption from the law is a dangerous by-product of religious bigotry, not religious liberty. Now, we see the harm. Systematically, anti-LGBTQ forces repeated and repeated again that their religious freedom would be harmed by LGBTQ equality; our marriages, our jobs, our families somehow harmed them. If they couldn't exclude us, fire us, or destroy our families, their relationship with Jesus would be diminished -- their families would be less valuable.In my decades of ministry within Metropolitan Community Churches (MCC), I have seen the harms of discrimination -- the alienation from families, from faith traditions, and even from our own bodies through self-destruction.Instead of repenting of these harms, right-wing pundits crank out fake story after fake story of Christians who feel they are being persecuted for their beliefs. No amount of myth busting or official contradictions stops the spread of these stories through social media and forwarded emails.It is time to blow the whistle on religious demagogues who say they are victims if they are not allowed to take away the rights of others.With the Hobby Lobby decision, no more than ""sincerely held"" religious beliefs are now needed to supersede the basic civil right to control your own body. What is to prevent an employer from asking reproductive questions during an interview? Have you now or have you ever used birth control? Have you ever or would you ever consider having an abortion?It is a short walk from there to allowing employers to screen or fire LGBTQ people with impunity.Oh, wait, they can do that now.President Obama is doing what he can to correct this. He is signing an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating against LGBTQ people in hiring. Despite religious conservatives and Republicans pushing Obama to include a sweeping religious exemption, he listened to LGBTQ advocates and pushed back against creeping governmental establishment of religion, which allows discrimination against women and LGBTQ people -- just for starters.In addition, a proposed act called ENDA, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, has been languishing in Congress for decades but is suddenly getting major support from conservatives. Once they realized the power of the religious exemption, they started acting like they cared about protecting LGBTQ jobs.Quickly, LGBTQ movement leaders including the Taskforce, Lambda Legal, National Center for Lesbian Rights, Transgender Law Center, and other groups announced they would no longer support ENDA with its insidious and ubiquitous religious exemption.Can we be clear about what religious freedom looks like? Religious freedom for people in the pews of Metropolitan Community Churches means we have:• Freedom to worship authentically • Freedom to be in joyful community • Freedom from being judged • Freedom to marry whom you love • Freedom from discrimination • Freedom to be a faith leaderSadly, conservatives act like their freedom depends on being able to dominate, define, and demean those who are different from themselves. Despite the damage of theocratic systems ranging from monarchies in Europe to the Taliban of the Near East, conservative Christians are quick to seek a ""Christian country"" which would enforce ""Christian values."" But let's be clear, it was Christians warring among themselves for centuries which created a need to disconnect religion from government.When the Puritans arrived on the shores of the Americas, they sought religious freedom -- for themselves. Puritans wanted to impose their beliefs on everyone, and often pilloried, imprisoned, whipped, and executed people who held different beliefs or broke the rules.European wars that led to people seeking religious freedom killed millions and wiped out thousands of towns. When religious conflict threatened to erupt in the ""New World,"" the 1649 ""Act of Tolerance"" was passed to protect Catholics from Puritans. But toleration only went so far, since the ""Act of Tolerance"" included the death sentence for anyone who denied the divinity of Jesus.Eventually, freedom of religion was included in the First Amendment. It was both freedom from the establishment of any religion by the government and the freedom to practice your own religion without fear of persecution. The meaning of protecting religious freedom has been shaped as we lived into it.Today, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and so many others live together under the protection of the United States Constitution and the First Amendment's protection of religion. There will always be religious leaders -- both well-intentioned and nefarious -- who try to impose their religion on others by using the courts or legal actions.Thomas Jefferson said, ""The price of Liberty is eternal vigilance."" The Bible is full of exhortations to stand watch, be ready, stay awake, and stay true.As a Christian, I follow Jesus, who put people before the law and mercy before judgment. As a member of the human community, I pray that we all live together in peace and freedom. It doesn't come easy, but do not fall asleep at this critical time. Stay awake! Stand up for freedom -- not just for yourselves, but for all people."
2,ARTS,Awol Erizku's Eight-Track,"Hilary Harkness, ContributorAward-winning artist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/awol-erizkus-eighttrack_b_5592678.html,Erizku is a photographer and a self-reflective curator.  He tells me that he envisioned his show as a mixtape - he's got some hits mixed in with some tracks that he might need to convince you are worth a listen.,2014-07-21,2014-07-16-ae_ohwhatafeelingawfuckitiwantatrillion14_LR.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-16-ae_ohwhatafeelingawfuckitiwantatrillion14_LR-thumb.jpg,"Mixtapes, mustaches, and muses. This is just one of the possible alliterations that comes to mind after I walk through The Only Way Is Up with artist Awol Erizku.Erizku is a photographer and a self-reflective curator. He tells me that he envisioned his show as a mixtape - he's got some hits mixed in with some tracks that he might need to convince you are worth a listen and he's thrown in some recording sessions - things that might evolve in later compilations.This frame helps me feel my way through the exhibition and I confidently nod in appreciation to the authoritative beats of his photographs in the front room - Portrait of a Muslim Boy (2014) is a soulful counterpoint to the upbeat Heads (2013), a grid of men and their hair flair. In the middle rooms are more experimental tracks anchored by what seems intended to be a hit single, a towering sculpture that is both a basketball play on Donald Judd's stack sculptures and Erizku's own career. He has gone from the Oh, what a feeling, fuck it, I want a Billion (2014) to this, Oh what a feeling, aw, fuck it, I want a Trillion (2014). A hefty appreciation!But even art stars can't risk being one (or two) hit wonders. With his photograph Girl in Park (2014), an updated version of a classic nude in nature, Erizku spins an art party-jam. I'm chilled out and going with it until I do a triple take at the framed Beyoncé shopping bags hanging on an adjacent wall. He's given the bags Paris Metro-style graffiti treatment - complete with armpit and beard hair fashioned from his locks and branded with silver stickers with his name on it. This is where I need Erizku the emcee to lay down some explanatory tracks. He tells me he had one of the bags in his room for six months when one day he woke up to Jay-Z singing about how only white women are held up in our culture as idols and his inspiration came in a flash.My mind jumps forward a hundred years from now, imagining a future art collector coveting Erizku Beyoncé bags as much for the chance to own a famous 21st century artist's hair as for their value as a works of art. Like relics of an art idol.As it is with albums I've listened to in the past, there's a certain track that sticks with me. In this show, it's the back room melody that I replay over and over. It's here where Erizku has sampled his muses with a rack of silk screened shirts calling out those who have come before. Each black jersey has the name of an artist that has influenced him, with the number referencing the year of the artist's birth. From hair to sweat to hair, here we are with the ultimate DNA moment - the birth of a potential hit record.The room is long like a basketball court, with the jerseys in the center. On either end, where the hoops would be are the impermanent #TRILL (2014) and #WAVY (2014). Erizku hints at Barack Obama and Michael Jackson as having some modicum of significance as well, but just a hint as this is where he has left room for improvisation and remixing as the times may require.There is much to rewind and erase when you're an emerging artist. Some of the process happens alone in the studio, but it continues once the viewers see your work. Your evolution as an artist is on display. Some artists are lucky to have hit after hit. And those hits can become seductive for some and paralyzing for others.Erizku's approach is refreshingly honest. He publicly acknowledges his influences while creating his own flow with a show that doesn't only showcase his photography - the more certain hits at this point in his career - but with works whose reception may be less sure.By the time he has his next show, his play on Judd's stacks may have reached another income bracket and Obama may no longer be 'wavy,' but his flow will still be his - trill and likely to keep the viewer moving to his beat.

3,PARENTS,10 Ways to Make Doctor Visits a Little Easier for Your Child,"Jessica Bensten, Contributor""Mothering Miracles"" Blogger/ Creative Director",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ten-ways-to-make-doctors-visits-easier-for-your-child_b_5594923.html,"It doesn't take long for kids, especially those with chronic issues, to develop phobias to doctors, specific offices and treatments. From my years as a waiting-room hopper, I've learned how to make the best of doctor's visits for me and for the kids.",2014-07-21,2014-07-17-1800191_10203204294699007_294940072_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-17-1800191_10203204294699007_294940072_n-thumb.jpg,"I think I spent half of my late twenties in doctors' offices with both of my children.With a micropreemie (Abby) and an immunosuppressed cancer fighter (Jackson), both of my children had a low tolerance for germs. It was very easy to pick up colds and viruses from a routine specialist checkup. Which meant another doctor visit. And then a follow up to that doctor's visit.Needless to say, it's a little like Cheers when we visit the doctor. Everyone knows our name and enjoys our co-pays. I'm surprised we don't have our own parking spot.Just as important as keeping up with Jackson and Abby's physical health is making sure they are happy. It doesn't take long for kids, especially those with chronic issues, to develop phobias to doctors, specific offices and treatments. From my years as a waiting-room hopper, I've learned how to make the best of doctor's visits for me and for the kids.The next time you schedule an appointment, these tips will help:1. Schedule appropriate appointment times. You know when your child eats, sleeps and gets grumpy. Schedule appointments when you know your child will have the best chance of being in a good mood. For us, that's usually in the morning around 9:30 or 10.2. Stay calm. I know I've lucked out with having great patients for kids. But the way a parent reacts or overreacts will influence their children to do the same. Discomfort and pain is frightening for a child. If you freak out, it only makes it worse for them. It's not helpful to tell your child to yell, ""Stop it!"" or ""That's enough!"" if they're really frightened. I've watched other parents do this, and it's just painful to watch.3. Remember all kids have bad days. I've had those days with Jackson and Abby. Try not to let the embarrassment of the moment override your focus. If you take the time to think about the humiliation, you'll lose the ability to figure out what to do. (Believe me!) Take a deep breath and continue comforting. No tantrum or fit lasts forever!4. Wash, wash, wash your hands. Wash after you leave the waiting room, and then again after you leave the exam room. Hospitals and doctor's office are the easiest place to pick up colds or viruses. Try not to let your child eat off the counters or teeth on hospital equipment.5. Talk them through the details. Kids understand more than you think so manage their expectations. If we're going to the audiologist, I tell Jackson: ""We're going to visit Dr. So and So. She's going to take a look in your ears and play a couple games with you to see how you can hear."" That way there's no confusion, he has an understanding of why we're going and it alleviates any fears about surprises.6. Keep them distracted. We've all had those appointments that should take 45 minutes, and two hours later, you're just getting back to the exam room. This is when I find myself getting creative. I've used the exam table paper to trace our hands, draw our family or make airplanes. You know that glove box on the counter? They make awesome balloon hands. The longer the doctor takes, the more gloves we use. I think that's a fair trade, don't you? Tongue depressors also make for great rulers to measure things around the room.7. Bring comfort items from home. It's better to start out prepared. Coloring books, crayons, stickers or regular books can help pass the time.8. Keep moving if you have to. In the beginning, if an office was running late, I'd stay in the packed waiting room because I didn't know I had a choice. Now I know better than to confine my kids during long waits. Today, if one of them needs to keep moving, I just let the receptionist know we'll be walking in the hall. Or if we're back in the exam room, I leave the door open so we can peek around the corner. It makes the kids feel less confined and it also provides entertainment.9. Reward good behavior. A trip to the dollar store, visit to the park or maybe an ice cream cone are great rewards for a good visit. Please don't punish your kid for a bad visit; instead, talk through what worried or upset them. Learn from it and move on together!10. Bring reinforcements. Another set of hands can keep your child occupied while you talk to the doctor. Remember to bring any questions that need to be answered."
4,WOMEN,"Hey, Execs Who Think Female Characters Won't Sell -- Come Marvel At Marvel",Sara Roncero-Menendez,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/female-thor-marvel_n_5589254.html,,2014-07-21,This image released by Marvel Comics shows a female superhero who will appear in upcoming Thor comic book issues. The new Thor was debuted on âThe Viewâ where artwork was revealed showcasing a buxom blonde clad in a caped costume and brandishing the trademark hammer. Series writer Jason Aaron said in a statement that âThis is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. ... This is THE Thor.â (AP Photo/Marvel Comics),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fb202400003000981738.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Tuesday's episode of ""The View,"" Marvel revealed a bombshell: Its new ""Thor"" series will star not a male god of Thunder, but a female one. Not a Thor sidekick. Not a simply a gender-swapped Thor-ess or Lady Thor. Just ""Thor,"" a woman worthy of wielding the hammer in her own right. The announcement comes on the heels of encouraging efforts by major comic book brands to put female characters in the spotlight this year. Marvel debuted ""Captain Marvel"" earlier this year, a series following the adventures of former Ms. Marvel Carol Danvers, ""Ms. Marvel,"" starring Muslim-American teenager Kamala Khan (another progressive decision), the badass ""Black Widow"" and ""She-Hulk,"" among others. By creating quality comics of powerful female superheroes, the comic book world is opening up to a new audience of women and girls as well as giving already hooked fans more of the powerful women they've come to know and love.DC Comics, another major player in comics, has also joined the trend of bringing female characters to the forefront. It has ""Wonder Woman"" flying solo in a self-titled series, as well as ""Supergirl"" and even Batman characters like ""Batgirl,"" ""Catwoman"" and ""Harley Quinn."" What's more, many of the issues starring female heroes sell in the top 30 of comics. The latest ""Harley Quinn"" was the fourth most-bought comic of June with over 90,000 copies sold. The first issue of ""Ms. Marvel"" sold out its first run and had to undergo a second printing, selling over 50,000 copies in its first month.Both Marvel and DC Comics are also pushing for more racial diversity. Marvel recently announced that Steve Rogers will be handing over his title as Captain America to Sam Wilson, formerly Falcon, making it the second time an African American has taken on the title (Isaiah Bradley being, arguably, the first). And DC recently introduced a Cree teenager with seasonally-influenced powers called Equinox, who joined the Justice League Canada team. There's no denying the fact the female-centric comics are excelling both creatively and financially, but they are also tackling a more important issue at hand: representation. At a time when only 15 percent of lead characters in major movies are female, it's important for audiences of all ages to see people like them saving the world, including people who don't happen to be white heterosexual males. ""The all-new Thor puts an exclamation point on our commitment to populating the Marvel Universe with smart, powerful, diverse female Super Heroes,"" Axel Alonso, Editor In Chief of Marvel Comics, told The Huffington Post. ""Our catalog is filled with characters that are defined by their actions, not by their gender. From Ms. Marvel to Black Widow, She-Hulk to Elektra, these unique women exhibit the same strengths and flaws as their male counterparts. If Peter Parker, an awkward teenager from Queens, can connect with generations of male fans, why can't Kamala Khan, an awkward teenager from Jersey City, connect with young girls now?""When this new Thor hits the scene, her thunderous entrance to the pantheon of comic book heroines will certain cause the comic world to take notice -- and perhaps the rest of the entertainment industry will, too."
5,SPORTS,Winning While Losing,"Lubomir Kavalek, ContributorInternational Chess Grandmaster",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/winning-while-losing_b_5582979.html,"Shortly after the final was over on July 7, 1974, I took the train from Amsterdam to the German town of Solingen where I was scheduled to play an important international chess tournament.",2014-07-20,2014-07-15-LionelMessiGermanyvArgentinalCyslIuiQEkl.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-15-LionelMessiGermanyvArgentinalCyslIuiQEkl-thumb.jpg,"On July 13 at the packed Maracanã stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Lionel Messi was handed the Golden Ball Trophy. It was an award going to the best soccer player of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. But instead of celebrating the joyful moment, he was looking down, crestfallen - a blue man in a blue jersey, in blue mood. His team, Argentina, was defeated by Germany 1-0 in the Cup's final.  Johan Cruyff in 1974 - WikipediaForty years ago, the amazing Dutch captain Johan Cruyff was in a similar situation. He won the Golden Ball, but the highly favored Netherlands lost the final match to Germany 1-2 at the Olympiastadion in Munich. The German team was awarded the FIFA World Cup Trophy that replaced the old Jules Rimet Trophy. It was the greatest chance for Cruyff and his teammates to win the Cup.Shortly after the final was over on July 7, 1974, I took the train from Amsterdam to the German town of Solingen where I was scheduled to play an important international chess tournament. The train left Amsterdam in silence. The Dutch passengers were either whispering or didn't talk at all. But as soon as we crossed the border into Germany, the mood changed. People were shouting, singing, sounding horns. They laughed, cried of joy and drank. Germany was running out of beer that day.Spassky out, Spassky InThe tournament in Solingen, celebrating the 600th anniversary of the town, almost didn't take place. The main attraction was Boris Spassky (photo above), but he was running out of favor in Moscow ever since he lost the world title to Bobby Fischer in Reykjavik in 1972. Almost at the last moment the Soviet Chess Federation decided to cancel Spassky's participation in Solingen. As a result, the main sponsor Egon Evertz sent telegrams to all players, the Soviet Federation and the Soviet Embassy. He explained that the tournament is being cancelled because the Soviets didn't keep their word. Within 24 hours Spassky got his traveling permit back and the event was on again. A series of five wins in the second half of the tournament allowed me to take the lead. The Soviet grandmaster Lev Polugaevsky was the only player who could have catch me with a win in the last round. There were only a few inaccuracies in that game. I decided to play quietly, but in time pressure my temperament got the better of me and I dove into wild waters and drowned in the rapids. With the win, Polugaevsky caught me. Spassky later said I was not being practical in time trouble and it was a good lesson for me, a cheap one since I still tied for first. The decisive momentIn his book Grandmaster Achievement, Polugaevsky described the must win situation this way: ""You must conduct the game as though it is of precisely no importance, but at the same time instill into each move all of your internal energy, concentrate extremely hard, and attempt to foresee anything unexpected.""Our game advanced slowly, but the tension rose around move 26. I could have removed my king from the pin along the g-file to the square f7. 'A practical move,' Spassky said later. 'That's what I would do in time pressure.' Instead, I charged with my queen to the center, provoking Polugaevsky to go for broke. My intuition told me I could save myself with a knight sacrifice on d5, but I miscalculated the consequences.Polugaevsky,Lev - Kavalek,Lubomir  Solingen 1974Polugaevsky's last move 27.f4, attacking the black queen, looked like desperation. He decided to force the play because he didn't see how to break through. Unfortunately, I was short of time and my next move was a blunder. From two squares I chose the wrong one for my queen. 27...Qd4?I should have gone deeper into white's territory with 27...Qe3!  After 28.Bxf5 black has two ways how to equalize: A. 28...Ncxd5!! I showed Polugaevsky this move after the game. His reaction? ""Beautiful, but unbelievable!"" It leads to a draw, but I had rejected it because of29.cxd5 and I saw that 29...Nxd5 doesn't make it because of 30.Bxd7 Qc1+ 31.Nd1!! (a winning deflection) Qxd1+ 32. Kf2 and the white king hides easily from checks.During the game I didn't see that the attack could be launched from the wing: 29....Nh5! 30.g4 (30.Ne2 Bb5-+) 30...Nxf4 31.Qd8 Qc1+ 32.Kf2 Qxb2+ 33.Kg3 Qxc3+ 34.Kxf4 Qc1+ and the white king can't escape from the checks. Other moves after 28...Nxd5!! do not help either:a) 29.Nxd5 29...Nxd5 30.Bxd7 Qc1+=c) 29.Ne2 Ne7! and black is better.d) 29.Bxd7 Qc1+ 30.Kf2 Qe3+=;B. Polugaevsky gave a question mark to the other move 28...Qc1+?  He thought that it loses but it is perfectly playable. 29.Ke2 (After 29.Kf2 Qxb2+ 30.Kg1 Qxc3 black is better.) 29...Qxb2+ 30.Kd3.  Polugaevsky thought he was winning because his king could hide, but this was a wrong evaluation, because of 30...Ncxd5!! 31.Nxd5 (31.cxd5 b5! 32.Bxd7 [or 32.Bxg6 c4+ 33.Kd4 Qf2 mate.] c4+ 33.Ke3 Qxc3+ 34.Ke2 Qc2+ 35.Ke1 Qe4+ 36.Kf1 Nxd7 and black should win.) 31...Nxd5 32.Bxd7 Qd4+ 33.Kc2 Ne3+ black has at least a draw. 28.Bxf5 Qxc4+ 29.Kg1 Ncxd5 After 29...Be8 30.Be6 Nxe6 31.Nf5+ wins. 30.Bxd7 Qxf4 White triumphs after 30...Nxc3 31.Nf5+ Kg8 32.Qxf6 Ne2+ 33.Kf2. 31.Qxf4 Nxf4 32.Bb5! d5 33.Nf3 d4 34.Na4 Ne4 35.Ne5!+- Ne6 36.Bc4 Nc7 On 36...Kf6 37.Nd7+ wins 37.Bd3 b5 38.Bxe4 bxa4 39.Bd3 Ne6 40.Bc4 Nf4 41.Kf2 and I resigned.Note that in the replay windows below you can click either on the arrows under the diagram or on the notation to follow the game.Images by Clive Rose and Wikipedia"

(Photo by Rob Kim/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb465312600003500825800.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rob Reiner says his new movie was inspired by Jack Nicholson. When they were talking to the press about their film, The Bucket List, Nicholson was asked what he wanted to be sure he did before he died. He said he wanted one more great love in his life. Reiner went to As Good as it Gets screenwriter Mark Andrus to write a story about a couple with a chance for one last great romance. That film is And So it Goes, with Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton. He plays an irascible realtor who has alienated just about everyone he knows. She plays a singer who is still mourning her late husband. In an interview, Reiner said that there are only three kinds of films that get financed by Hollywood studios these days: ... big superhero tent-pole franchise movies, animated films and R-rated raunchy comedies. There's not one film that I've ever made that could get made today by a studio, not one, even A Few Good Men because it's an adult courtroom drama and studios do not make them any more. And so every movie that I make, have made and will make is always going be independently financed. And the reason they don't make movies for adults and for people which are the largest bulge of the population is because they are not usually going to the movie the first weekend. They take a while to learn about it, probably word of mouth. It takes a lot of money to release a picture. They want to get the money right away and so they want to make blockbuster-type movies. But there is a lot of money to be made if you give that audience something that they want to see and hopefully with Diane Keaton and Michael Douglas the first time they've ever been together, they'll be interested to see that.The last time Reiner directed Michael Douglas, he was playing a close-to-perfect character in The American President. This time his character, Oren Little, is a bitter man who wants nothing to do with anyone, including his son and granddaughter. Reiner keeps the audience on Oren's side by showing us ""the evolution which happens in the character as he progresses through the film.""Here's a guy who may have had this rough side to begin with but it is exacerbated by the fact that his son had drug problems and he's been estranged from his son. His wife passed away and he's basically ready to check out and get out of there. He meets this woman who lives next door in this fourplex and finds out that he has a 10-year-old granddaughter that he didn't even know he had. It's through the relationship with them that a softer side of him starts to come out and I think you then ultimately come to like him. But it takes a while.Reiner described the estrangement between Oren and his son. Oren's a lot of bigger-than-life kind of character. He talks about how he has the biggest real estate deals and he has his face on the bus bench. And I think for kids sometimes growing up if your father has a larger-than-life character you can feel diminished. And if you are person who is shy and doesn't have an outgoing personality you can feel like you're a failure or like you don't live up to him, and so I think there was an insecurity with that young guy and he started using drugs as a way to feel better. And then he got into a bad place and maybe the father wasn't as available as he might have been in those early years. I think of that generation, when the parents were more hooked into each other than they were to the children. I think that in our generation we dote on our children more than our parents did to us.Both of the lead characters are struggling with grief and loss. But the contrast between their responses is one of the ways we learn about the different ways they approach life and relationships. I think you have two people that have shut down a part of themselves because of loss. She is trying to reconnect with life by launching this singing career at age 65, but the part of her that thinks of herself as a sexual being is kind of tucked away. He's thinking, ""I'm gonna go away and just live in Vermont and go fishing."" They kind of do this dance around each other for a while until they start to feel like these feelings are reawakened inside of them. But then just like when you're a young person feeling that, it's scary. When you're a young person you're nervous because you don't know what you're doing and you're kind of fumbling around, but when you get to become an adult you've had wives and husbands and you've been through it and you know what it's like to have a loss and how painful it is to have a loss. You're a little tentative about being with that person for those reasons so the dance looks the same but what at stake is slightly different.This is Reiner's third consecutive film featuring a character who is a young girl. Sterling Jerins plays Oren's granddaughter. Sterling is really gifted. She came in to read for me and I was like, 'Whoa, who is this person?' She was nine years old at the time and she had done a part in World War Z. She played Brad Pitt's daughter. She had a little experience and she just stuck to it. She wasn't intimidated at all. That's a good thing about kids -- you don't know anything to know that you should be intimidated. You can always tell if a kid is going to be good if you look at their parents. Her mother was great and you knew that she was going to be okay. The ones that are troubled you can tell where it's coming from.Reiner says he never got any advice directly from his father, the legendary writer/director/actor Carl Reiner, but he learned a great deal from watching him. When I was 14, 15, 16 during the summer when I was off from school, I would go every single day with him to The Dick Van Dyke Show and watch him. I watched him work with the actors, work with the writers. I saw the stage, the performances and where they put the cameras and all that. So that's how I learned. It wasn't so much from him sitting down, ""Well, son, this is how you do it.""He also learned a great deal when he was a young actor on All in the Family, playing the son-in-law of Archie Bunker. We did over 200 shows in front of a live audience. So I learned a lot about what audiences like, what they don't like, how stories are structured. I would spend a lot of time in the writing room and I actually wrote some scripts. And from Carroll O'Connor I learned a lot about how you perform and how important the script and story are for the actors. So the actor doesn't have to push things. You can let the story and the dialogue support you if it's good. I had great people around me and I took from all the people that was around.He compared Oren to Archie Bunker. Carroll O'Connor brought his humanity to the character even though he had these abhorrent views. He's still a feeling, human being. He loved his wife even though he acted the way he did, and he loved his daughter. Those things come out. I don't think anybody's all good or all bad."

But reporters fear a government sensitive to criticism is now cracking down, especially on coverage of the battle against Boko Haram.After 15 years of democracy, journalists believe the state is trying to tame the vibrant, prolific media during its faltering campaign to stamp out the militant Islamist group.One Friday last month the army seized newspaper print-runs, halted distribution vans across the country and ransacked offices of newspaper distributors and agents, detaining staff for several hours, the Nigerian Press Organization said.For Femi Adesina, now editor-in-chief of Nigeria's top tabloid, The Sun, this awoke bad memories of life under military rule, when reporters were routinely hauled in for questioning over their news stories.""You virtually had your heart in your mouth. You wrote the story and you didn't know whether you should sleep at home or sleep somewhere else,"" recalled Adesina, who is also president of the Nigerian Guild of Editors. ""If we are not careful as a country, we could slide back to those dark days.""While reporters accuse the security forces from time to time of intimidation, conditions for journalists remain a long way from the era of military dictatorship. Newspapers are able to publish vitriolic criticism of President Goodluck Jonathan that is largely tolerated.Spokesmen for the presidency and police and a spokeswoman for the state security service did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.However, the military said it made the searches last month after receiving intelligence on the movement of ""materials with grave security implications"" through newspaper distribution channels. One security source told Reuters there was a genuine concern that militants were using the vans to transport explosives.Nevertheless, the press organization says the military is using national security as an excuse for a crackdown on critical media coverage before elections next year.Adding to journalists' anger, Nigeria's broadcast regulator has ruled that stations must give at least 48 hours' notice in writing before airing a live political program - a near impossibility given the impromptu nature of such coverage.A local election in the western state of Ekiti in June that was otherwise deemed free and fair was marred by allegations of intimidation of local journalists, five of whom were arrested by police. In Akwa Ibom state in the oil producing Niger Delta, the editor of the Global Concord newspaper has been detained for two weeks after being bundled into a car by state security agents. The paper had repeatedly criticized the local government.Nigeria ranks 112th out of 180 countries on the Reporters Without Borders press freedom index, above India and Mexico, but below East African nations Kenya and Uganda.Jonathan has repeatedly expressed his support for freedom of the press, while also calling on its members to be ""professional and accurate"".""Under my leadership, journalists in our country will continue to fully enjoy their constitutional rights and freedom of expression,"" he said in 2012.LOSING PATIENCEThe government seems to be losing patience with press coverage of its fight against Boko Haram, an insurgent group which has killed thousands since 2009 in a push to carve out an Islamic state in the largely Muslim north.Boko Haram's own attitude to press freedom was neatly displayed in 2012, when it blew up the offices of mildly pro-government ThisDay for what it called ""insulting the Prophet"".The newspaper had angered Muslims a decade ago when one of its columnists suggested the Prophet Mohammed might have wanted to marry a beauty queen.Jonathan, a southern Christian, has been criticized at home and abroad for his slow response to Boko Haram's April kidnapping of more than 200 girls from a school in the rural northeast, and for his inability to quell the violence.""Newspapers have reported this insurgency independently,"" said The Sun's Adesina. ""Apparently they're not comfortable with our independent reportage of what is happening in the country.""While press freedom is guaranteed under Nigerian law, in reality the media face retribution that is ""episodic, unpredictable and very often arbitrary"", said John Campbell, a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.Going after the wrong ""Big Man"", or politically well-connected person, can be dangerous.""In a general climate of lawlessness, if a newspaper publishes something that a big man or some part of the government doesn't like, it's likely to have its offices ransacked by a mob,"" Campbell said.Nigerian journalists are still killed for their work, just as activist and writer Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged by the military government in 1995. The Committee to Protect Journalists names Nigeria as one of 13 countries where the murder of a journalist is most likely to go unpunished.Since 2009 at least five journalists have been murdered with no perpetrators brought to book, the organization says.Yet overall the press has always been good at defending its freedom: even military dictator Sani Abacha never fully suppressed its feistiness in the 1990s.""Press freedom has always been good,"" said popular journalist and blogger Tolu Ogunlesi. ""It's hard to muzzle or intimidate the press in Nigeria. Even Abacha failed to control them: they went underground ... (and) used radio."" ""ANY KIND OF STORY""Taking stock of newspapers in Africa's biggest economy is a dizzying exercise: there are at least a dozen major national dailies running to 40 pages each and scores of regional titles.The big dailies are clearly influenced by their counterparts in Britain, which ruled Nigeria before independence in 1960. The Sun even publishes photos of ""page three girls"", albeit fully clothed, unlike the topless models in its British namesake.But big circulations and flashy headlines fail to mask the sometimes low standards of an industry which, much like the country itself, is mired in corruption and political influence.Slipshod reporting helps to fuel misinformation about the insurrection in the north, especially since the bulk of the big newspapers, and their reporters, are based in the mainly Christian south.""You can cook up any kind of story and it gets published,"" said Dayo Aiyetan, a reporter and the executive director at the International Center for Investigative Reporting, a Nigerian NGO. ""You can malign anybody, you can libel anybody and nothing happens. That's the environment.""Aiyetan works with the U.S. Ford Foundation on a program to help train Nigerian journalists in investigative reporting techniques and raise standards. But that also means tackling the culture of ""brown envelopes"" or bribes for stories.The practice is so widespread that some reporters say they aren't paid by their employers. Instead, they are expected to earn money from the people they interview.""The press is certainly lively, though you wouldn't want to rely on them,"" said a Western diplomat. ""Sometimes they expect to be paid to write a story, and we have to say 'No, I'm afraid we don't do that.'""Bribery compromises reporters' independence and is another disincentive to expose corruption. Even some newspaper owners face corruption allegations.The owner of Nigeria's Independent newspaper, former Delta State Governor James Ibori, is serving 13 years in prison in Britain after pleading guilty to 10 counts of money laundering.""You cannot expect these newspapers to be absolutely free to do the kind of critical reportage we need to make an impact on corruption and good governance in Nigeria,"" said Aiyetan, the investigative reporter. ""It's actually not just corruption we're fighting. It's the impunity with which people steal money."" (Editing by David Stamp)"
