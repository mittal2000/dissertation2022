0,PARENTING,How the Boy Scouts Can Restore Their Reputation in this Eagle Scout's Eyes,"John McCormick, Contributor

The brothers settled out-of-court after suing the Boy Scouts in 2003 for abuse they had suffered at the hands of one of their Scoutmasters. The Stewarts are angry that the Boy Scouts of America have fought to keep confidential thousands of files the organization has kept since the early 1900s on suspected pedophiles within their ranks. The Stewarts say releasing the files decades ago would have helped stop pedophiles.

Barry was a district Scout leader when I joined the Boy Scouts as an 11-year-old. He was dynamic, athletic and a born leader, and my fellow Scouts adored him. We were amazed by how caring and involved he was. Though he lived in a town 30 miles from my own, I was surprised to see him appear at our Little League football games as a spectator.Within the next year, we discovered that Barry had, for reasons not fully explained to us, been dismissed from his position. When we asked our troop's Scoutmasters, we were told it was for private reasons and not to worry. Still, we were puzzled by the way our Scoutmasters talked afterwards in hushed tones around the campfire.I thought no more about Barry until years later, when I met a friend at college who grew up in a town near my own. Gradually, our conversation turned to Boy Scouts. I soon learned from my friend that Barry had molested him after a scouting event. I was impressed by my friend's courage and resilience, but I could see how much the deep pain of his abuse still hurt him psychologically, and emotionally, a decade later. and to obey the Scout Law ...The revelation this month that the Boy Scouts kept secret records for a century on Scout leaders who were sexual predators -- which internally they called ""perversion files"" -- has left me conflicted and confused. According to The New York Times, copies of the files -- over 15,000 pages detailing allegations of sex crimes against more than 1,200 Scout leaders over a twenty-year period -- were released by an Oregon law firm. The firm obtained the files as evidence in an $18.5 million civil judgment against the Scouts in 2010. Though the Boy Scouts fought in the courts for years to prevent the release of these documents, their national president, Wayne Perry, issued a statement this month admitting, ""There have been instances where people misused their positions in Scouting to abuse children, and in certain cases, our response to these incidents and our efforts to protect youth were plainly insufficient, inappropriate, or wrong.""When I heard of the release of the secret files, I first thought of my college friend. While he no doubt welcomes the Scouts' public admission, I'm sure it stirred up long-buried pain and sorrow.I also thought about my own mixed and often contradictory feelings. After I joined the Boy Scouts as an 11-year-old Tenderfoot, I persevered to become an Eagle Scout. Boy Scouts taught me many skills and values for which I'll forever be grateful. To this day, my Eagle Scout award is the single honor I'm most proud of.Thanks in part to the good habits and life lessons learned as a Boy Scout, I graduated from college, then law school, later serving as a state and federal prosecutor. As a prosecutor, I sometimes investigated child sex crimes (often committed by family members, friends or officials in positions of trust), perpetrated on children as young as 5 or 6. I saw first-hand the devastating effect that pedophiles have on their victims, but was also reassured by the committed work of sex crimes detectives, social workers and child psychologists.Finally, I viewed the revelation of sex abuse in the Boy Scouts from the position of a dad. The files are filled with the types of tragic stories that haunt the nightmares of every parent. At the same time, I acknowledge that I want my own sons to learn about the positive side of Scouting and the benefits it offers. I can still recite the Scout Oath and Law by memory, and I've tried to teach my sons the truths and values embodied in those words I recited at the start of hundreds of Scout meetings.A Scout is trustworthy ...While I'm grateful that the Boys Scouts have begun to admit their mistakes and are instituting a Youth Protection Program to protect minors from sexual abuse, I've come to the realization that the Boy Scouts egregiously breached their first and perhaps most important law -- trustworthiness. The Scouts violated their own duty to the children entrusted to their care. While some of the records were indeed used to prevent pedophiles from returning to Scouting, in other instances Scout leaders and civic authorities conspired to cover up abuse in order to protect the institution of Scouting and its reputation. By their own count, the Boy Scouts admit that a third of all abuse cases weren't reported to the police.Worse, the Boy Scouts fought for years in the courts to prevent the release of their secret files. Some of the right actions and expressions of remorse recently taken by the Boy Scouts appear to have been brought about not as an act of redemption, but by the actions of victims, lawyers, judges and advocacy groups. As my own Scoutmaster -- a true role model and a man of impeccable integrity -- once told me, it's not messing up that you'll be remembered for as much as what you've done to correct your mistakes....to help other people at all times, and to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.To restore its good name, the Boy Scouts must place the interests and needs of abuse victims before the protection of their own organization. As a first step, the Boy Scouts should provide assistance, counseling, treatment and financial aid to those who were victimized. The Boy Scouts have invested heavily in a Youth Protection Program -- and that's a good thing- - but they need to invest more in a Victim Support Program. The Boy Scouts need to reach out to every single victim of abuse with offers of help and support. Counseling hotlines should be established, as well as outreach facilities offering whatever services victims, as well as their families, need to heal. If parents are to trust their children's well-being to this organization, and if the Boy Scouts are to redeem themselves in the eyes of this former Eagle Scout, they need only be true to their own Oath.John McCormick and his sons William and Connor are the authors of ""Dad, Tell Me A Story,"" How to Revive the Tradition of Storytelling with Your Children (Nicasio Press 2010).

1,WELLNESS,Lessons Learned Training for First Marathon,"Dylan Armajani, Contributor

Since deciding to run the marathon, I have traveled over 900 miles by foot, and spent nearly 140 hours training.",2012-10-29,2012-10-27-462592_4733293376036_518902651_o1_benKo.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-10-27-462592_4733293376036_518902651_o1_benKo-thumb.jpg,"Today, as I completed my last training run in the double digits of miles until the ING NYC Marathon (Sunday, November 4), I found my mind wandering. Running a marathon has never been a bucket list item for me. Growing up I despised running, which in itself is how I ended up choosing to run a marathon to give back and show my father how much I appreciate him. Little did I know, that one decision would impact me so greatly.The 26.2 miles I will run on November 4 may be for my father and other stroke survivors, but this race has become about so much more. As of today, since deciding to run the marathon I have traveled over 900 miles by foot, and spent nearly 140 hours training. During those 140 hours I have learned some very valuable lessons, and before the thrill and the rush of the marathon sweeps over me, I would like to take a moment to share three of these lessons with you.Lesson 1:  New York Road Runner races start with seeded corrals based on past race results. Somewhere over the 900 miles run, I earned the blue (first corral) race bib. On a Sunday in September, I found myself with one of my teammates on The Dashing Whippets walking to the starting line of a 10-mile race in the Bronx. I didn't know the course, and never had raced a course longer than five miles. I had done one half-marathon before, but I didn't race it, I just ran. Quite frankly, I was afraid. Afraid of finding out what I was capable of, afraid of pushing myself and failing.This particular teammate of mine is a young chap about 10 years my senior who is a staple of the New York running community, a speedy leader who I can't help but look up to as an inspiration. I asked him what pace he planned on going out at, and he said something like ""6:25 per mile, how about you?"" I remember saying, ""I think i'm going to take this one easy. I'm going to start back a few corrals and do 7:30 per mile or so.""To this day, i'll never forget him patting me on the back and saying, ""It took me a year to earn the blue bib, come on up to the front. You've put in the hard work and earned the right to start at the front of the race.""So I did, and I ended up running all out, with everything I had to give. I remember sprinting the last 200 meters all out, as if it was a 5K. I finished in 1:08:44, good for a 6:53-per-mile pace -- My first run over five miles breaking a 7:00-per-mile pace.On that day, I learned to not be afraid of what I have earned. More importantly, I learned that I shouldn't be afraid of pushing myself and finding out what my potential is, because if I've put in the hard work I should be proud of what I am capable of. Thank you, Ben, for this photo!Lesson 2: After I foolishly raced back to back days settings PR's at both the four-mile distance and the half-marathon distance, I ended up injuring my foot with some tendonitis and a micro tear in a ligament in my right foot. I was forced to take two weeks off from running. My first race back was another race at the half-marathon distance.My plan was to take the race nice and slow, mentally taking the time to check my body every mile for any discomfort or pain. The moment the report of the starting gun hit my ears, I was off. Within seconds, my plan was thrown to the wind as I set out at PR pace. I felt like a kid running around the playground, my mind was free from any worries. I was in the zone, running and enjoying myself. I held that pace, and ended up with a PR of 1:30:53 or a 6:56-per-mile pace -- my first half-marathon with a sub-7:00-per-mile pace.I learned a lesson that will make most coaches and trainers cringe. I run to be free, to feel happy and leave all the stresses of life behind. I run not necessarily to find myself, but to naturally and mindlessly create who I am. Sometimes you need to throw the plan out, and just be who you naturally and subconsciously are. I believe that your body knows who you are better than your mind does. Sometimes, it's worth shutting your mind off and just letting your body do its thing.Lesson 3: For the first few months of my newfound running regimen, I never physically ran with anybody. It was always me, my headphones, and my thoughts. Naturally, my mind wandered, and in times where I needed a pick-me-up I would find myself thinking about why I was doing this (for my father) and I would always find the motivation I needed inside to push on.However, at a five-mile race on Father's Day I found myself about half a mile from the finish line running on fumes. I had gone out way too fast. I had never run a mile sub-7:00 in my life, and I was on pace to run five miles at a sub-7:00-per-mile pace.And then suddenly I heard a wall of noise and cheers. It was The Dashing Whippets cheering squad. Somehow those cheers injected me with enough energy to push on, and I ended up finishing my fastest five-mile race to date with a time of 33:51, good for a 6:47-per-mile pace.Immediately after getting home I looked up who The Dashing Whippets were, and soon thereafter I joined. Since then, running has never been a solo sport. I learned that there is power in a collective, and there is power in being surrounded by like-minded people.Having teammates pull you when you are feeling weak and push you even harder when you are feeling strong is an incredible experience. Knowing that there is a camaraderie where teammates will take hours out of their day to stand on the side of a course cheering your name and giving you a high-five for the 15 seconds that you are within sight of them, or spend half of the day kneeling on the edge of the course snapping photos of you as you zip by, means that you are never alone. Learning that running does not need to be a solitary thing is a fantastic lesson. The confidence, inspiration, and camaraderie that have become part of me because of my teammates is perhaps the most valuable tool that I could ever have gained. Dashing Whippets cheering -- thanks, Henry, for this photoI have no doubt that regardless of what happens on November 4, for a moment my world will be all about me. But I hope that a few moments later, I remember all the experiences and people that got me to this point... ready to run 26.2 miles (and I hope finish).That being said, if you are in New York City, please come out and cheer for me. I will be leaving Staten Island at 9:40 a.m. in wave one, and my bib number is 14065. You'll see me wearing my Dashing Whippets blue proudly with my National Stroke Association badge. If you come out and cheer on November 4, this is what you should look for.For more by Dylan Armajani, click here.For more on fitness and exercise, click here."

Carrie described it as ""a little too much"" and she was right. The enormous sparkler was bold, and, like all cocktail rings should be, a conversation starter. As the days get shorter and our wardrobes get darker, we all need a little sparkle. And what better way than to slip on a cocktail ring? The oversized baubles can be more daring than your style usually is, and that's precisely the point. Your LBD just became that much more interesting with that knuckle-duster on your hand. Your business suit from today's meeting just went from boring business wear to evening-appropriate with a large gold cocktail ring (and an extra button undone on your silk blouse, naturellement). There's no need to pull a Kim Kardashian with a two million dollar ring either, not with sites like Bauble Bar where you can spend a pittance for something really pretty.Here, seven cocktail rings to get this party started.

My family and I are preparing for the Frankenstorm to hit the East Coast. Maybe this will be the biggest storm we've ever seen. Maybe it will be no big deal. A monster storm hit this time last year, knocking the power out for two days. What follows are lessons I learned from last year's storm. Some of these tips saved time and money. Others saved my sanity. So after you've gathered the canned foods, batteries and water, consider these: 1. Pack a suitcase (including medication and toys) before the lights go out. That way everything is ready in case you need to evacuate.2. Add bags of ice to your freezer. It will keep food cold longer while the power is out.3. If you have a deep freezer, put all the food from the fridge in the deep freeze to minimize loss.4. If you evacuate to a hotel, bring an electric skillet or electric griddle, food and a cooler. Cooking in your room will save money.5. In advance of a storm locate books, board games, toys and other entertainment that doesn't require electricity. Crayons, paper and art supplies can be a real life saver if you have kids.6. Make a communication plan with friends and family. Decide in advance if you will stay in touch via phone, text, email or some other way.7. If you evacuate to a friend's house, bring the fresh food from your fridge. You can share your food with your hosts and keep in from spoiling at your house while you're gone.8. If you evacuate to a hotel, ask about their plan for hotel guests should the power go out. Some hotels have will have a generator that provides for in room power only. Meaning there will be no lights in the halls. Other hotels will have full power throughout the facility.9. If you evacuate to a hotel, bring a swimsuit. An indoor pool is a great way to pass the time.10. If you have a fireplace, pick up firewood before the storm. 11. If you have a gas stove you can likely cook even though the lights are out. Use a match to light the burners.12. Charge all electronic devices (phones, games, iPod/iPad, portable DVD player) and locate car chargers.13. Clean the house before the storm. It's easier to locate necessary items if they are in their rightful place. Also, there's nothing worse than stepping on toys, valuables or a wayward battery in the dark.14. Stock up on pet food and supplies including litter, newspaper and wee wee pads. If your pet needs to potty indoors, being prepared can reduce the mess, odor and frustration.15. Sign up for text alerts from your state emergency management center and local utility companies.16. If you participate in a credit card or hotel points program, check you point balance. You may be able to use points for a local hotel, flights or gas.17. Ask about distress rates at local hotels and apartment buildings. During a recent storm our local hotel was sold out but a nearby luxury apartment building rented out their model units for a very good rate. The apartment building didn't advertise the rentals, but offered the available units to area families that called and asked.18. If you have to leave your home, leave your porch light on. This allows friends and neighbors check if your power is on without entering your house.19. Go for a walk or exercise before the storm. You'll likely feel less restless when stuck inside if you have a good workout under your belt.20. Keep a camera handy. Not only can you record fun storm memories, but you'll also be able to photograph any damage to your home, car or other property.Be safe and enjoy the storm!"

The real thing commanded almost nine times that price, with a 1955 Fender Stratocaster guitar often played on stage by Wood bringing in $60,800.Bidding took place live online as well as in person and by phone at Julien's Beverly Hills gallery on Friday and Saturday.The auction comes ahead of the release next February of the memoirs of Wood's ex-wife Jo, which promise to reveal her tales of life as the wife of a Rolling Stone.Ronnie and Jo Wood were married for 23 years before separating in 2008 when Ronnie left her for a young cocktail waitress named Ekaterina Ivanova. The couple's divorce was finalized in 2011.After the auction was announced in September, the former couple issued opposing statements feuding about the ownership of the auction items, but seemed to have worked out their disagreements. Julien described the items for sale as jointly owned and said that they were part of the couple's divorce settlement.Part of the proceeds from the auction will go to MusiCares, the Grammy Awards charity that offers help to people in the music industry with finance and addiction.Wood has recently been focused on his visual art career, but is best known as a musician with the Rolling Stones and The Faces. He has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice.In addition to her upcoming memoirs, Jo Wood - a former model - has also founded a skincare line.
