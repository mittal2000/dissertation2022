",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafccae1f00003901231ab2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This past Fourth of July, my family and I celebrated with friends and family just like millions of American families across the United States. We decided to watch the fireworks with another same-gender-parented family at a nearby lakefront beach.My oldest son, who's just turned eight, and the other family's little girl played along the beach, digging tunnels and building castles. An older boy, who was playing by himself, eventually introduced himself to the little group and the three of them played for almost two hours. I've always been proud that my son makes friends easily and often. He's oblivious to gender, race or socio-economic barriers and simply asks strangers, ""do you want to play with us (me)?"" If they answer ""yes"", it's on. If it's ""no""...well, he's never received ""no"" as an answer.As darkness approached, my son bounded up to me with a swagger that hinted of a request. I braced myself for whatever came next. Instead of asking for the one hundredth time if they could go swimming, my son asked, ""Dad, can you explain to my friend where my mom is?"" The friend, whose accent seemed to be East African, looked bewildered at seeing me, my partner and our 6-month-old baby in my arms. To add to the little boy's confusion, no one in my family has the same skin tone. We stretch from Northern European to African-American ancestry, with biracial and East Indian along the continuum.I took a deep breath and explained, ""He has a mom, but she doesn't live with us. She chose our family. And we're an adoptive family."" The boy's English was broken but clear. ""So he lives without a mom?"" ""Yes,"" I replied, ""but he has two dads."" With that, the boy seemed satisfied and walked away. They played for a little longer but then he went back to his family and the fireworks started. We didn't see him again afterwards.There are many other things I would like to have said to the little boy. For instance, his mother chose our family over lots of straight couples. In order to adopt, we went through a rigorous homestudy and countless hours of training. We waited and waited and waited some more. To adopt both our boys, we've spent a small fortune of our savings and even more emotionally. The list would be endless. However, sometimes kids just need the facts. Plain and simple. To know that our son is loved and treasured seemed enough for the little boy. And on a chilly Fourth of July night, it was enough for our son to hear.However we respond to these types of questions, from children or adults, whether innocent or malicious, the one thing we need to keep in mind is this: our children are within earshot and this is how they learn to answer the same questions when they are posed to them. Modeling an informational, respectful, non-confrontational attitude is something we want to instill in our kids. We've learned that most people are interested about the adoption process or just curious. As long as the curiosity and interest are respectful, we usually opt to be informative rather that acerbic. Even when the line of questioning has veered to intrusiveness, we've guarded ourselves from witty or sarcastic retorts. We choose this path not because we're passive or non-confrontational. Sometimes, it would feel appropriate and incredibly satisfying to (in the words of a dear friend) ""get all Julia Sugarbaker on them,"" a reference to the famously irascible character on the TV show ""Designing Women."" However, my son is listening and his adoption story is not the stuff of derision or quick jabs. His story is something we honor and respect. It's one of love and blessing. It's one he will own the rest of his life and I want him to treasure it as we do.I'm not sure what, if any effect, my response had on the little boy. But I know that it reassured my son about his family's love and respect for him. He didn't say as much, but I could sense it when the fireworks began and he decided to curl up with me under a blanket against the chill of the beach. I know I cannot protect him from everything he'll encounter in his life, but I can provide him with the tools to be self-assured and proud of his adoption story. In the end, the only people we have to ""win over"" are my sons and I think we've done a good job so far.This article first appeared on http://gayswithkids.com/dad-can-you-explain/"
1,EDUCATION,Why I Taught My Class About Ferguson,"Franchesca Warren, Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teaching-kids-about-ferguson_b_5745468.html,"Each time I gathered materials to teach these 'controversial' units, there was always a fleeting voice in my head that questioned if these were topics my sophomores and juniors could handle, but within minutes I pushed those thoughts to the side and decided that for the benefit of my students.",2014-09-02,"FILE - In this Aug. 17, 2014 file photo protesters demonstrate against the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Since the Aug. 9 shooting death of the black 18-year-old by white police officer Darren Wilson, protesters have invested their time decrying the killing as an illustration of racial inequities in the nation's policing. Now, thousands from New York to California and points overseas are investing their money _ in staggering amounts, as contributions to Brown's family and Wilson. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5babe4672400003100547211.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Many years ago a retiring teacher left me with a quote that has stuck with me all my years in education: ""I don't care what adults think about me, the only concern I have is about the kids and what's best for them."" When she told me this I thought about it, but it did not resonate with me until many years later when I was called into the office for teaching a unit about genocide. During this particular unit, students were reading excerpts from two novels, Night by Elie Wiesel and Left to Tell by Immacule Ilbizaga. A parent was concerned that the content material was too traumatic for students to read. As I listened to my principal tell me about the parent's concerns, all I could think about was the quote from the retiring teacher the year before. As we finished the conversation, I apologized for the parent being scared of the material, but I argued that there was a need for students to learn about genocide. While I agreed to be 'careful' I would not budge on skipping over certain parts to make parents feel better. I knew that my job as a teacher was to make sure that the students that were placed in front of me were more aware because of my class. My job was to not only teach them, but to expose them to lessons in social justice.   So every time there is conflict around the world (which is often) I make a choice to expose them to lessons in social justice. I did this: • When I decided to have a unit on genocide, I covered the current historical events leading up to the conflict between Palestine and Israel.  • When 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was killed, I used this as a teaching opportunity for all of my kids as we discussed biases and used this case as the basis of our argumentative unit.  • When 20 children and six adults were killed in Newtown, Connecticut we discussed mental health and the gun control needed to keep tragedies like this from happening again.  • When Jordan Davis was gunned down outside of a convenience store in Jacksonville, Florida we used this as we paralleled the fight for Justice with the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. Each time I gathered materials to teach these 'controversial' units, there was always a fleeting voice in my head that questioned if these were topics my sophomores and juniors could handle, but within minutes I pushed those thoughts to the side and decided that for the benefit of my students, it was important that I made my teaching and their learning relevant to the world around them. So I used newspaper articles, first hand accounts and videos to not only teach the children, but for them to have lively conversations about the world and more importantly social justice.So imagine the horror, when I opened my Facebook account not even two weeks ago and saw a video (that a Ferguson resident shot) of a teen laid out in the middle of the street dead. As I followed the news reports that followed, I learned that this dead young man was Mike Brown, a recent graduate of Normandy High School. The more I watched of the protests and facts from the case, I knew that the majority of my kids could have been Brown and it was my duty to use this case as I taught a unit on argumentative writing. As I opened up the unit with the facts from the fatal shooting all of my kids were attentive as they listened to witnesses of the shooting speak. The entire lesson my kids were engaged, accountable and willing to push themselves to limits that many of them were wary to do. When I left class that day, I was proud that kids were not only learning, but were becoming engaged in social justice issues that directly affect them. As I went home to do more research, I was saddened that in several teacher groups I participated in were mad that other people would want to talk about this incident not only in class, but even as a topic of discussion. I saw people argue that the killing of an unarmed teen was not an issue to discuss in school, because the child 'had' to be doing something wrong to be shot. I even watched as fellow teachers had the nerve to describe the dead teen as a thug, without even knowing him! Even on my own blog, a commenter had the nerve to say that because no one from Normandy High School had spoken up for Brown, it was evident that he was not a 'good' student -- just like in the case involving George Zimmerman. To say I was angry was an understatement. When did teachers stop protecting students? When did students become the criminals? When did students become responsible for actions of adults? As teachers it's our job to not put opinions into our kids heads, but to be agents of reason. In our classrooms we have a duty to not only expose students but: • To discuss issues that impact our students-despite our personal feelings.  • To be defenders of social justice, not upholders of the unspoken status quo that we see daily in our schools.  • To speak up for children, no matter what. As I read more commentary on social media from fellow educators, I started to see the 'tide' turning and teachers defend the protesters in Ferguson and even begin to question the point of protesting for the breakdown of public education, if teachers couldn't protest the killing of children anywhere whether it was Chicago, Ferguson, Sanford, Gaza, Israel or Iraq. As teachers we defend children -- period. If we can call for the boycott of over-testing children, funding for our public schools then we should all be able to defend children. In the coming weeks, months and years people will continue to debate the shooting of Brown, but as teachers we should be diligent in being defenders of social justice and exposing our students to the world. I know I will, will you?ALSO ON HUFFPOST:"
2,POLITICS,Why Obama Should Ask Congress for an ISIS AUMF,"Daniel R. DePetris, ContributorNational Security Dude, Observer of Congress, Currently Outsid...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-obama-should-ask-cong_b_5745460.html,"If the Obama administration finds it necessary to expand U.S. military activity against the IS into Syria, President Obama will quickly face a wave of pressure on Capitol Hill on the need to submit a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force for congressional debate and approval.",2014-09-02,"US President Barack Obama holds a press conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, DC, August 28, 2014. Obama said Thursday he would send his Secretary of State John Kerry to the Middle East to build support in the region against Islamic State (IS) jihadists. AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d46e3c000018010df8aa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama and his national security advisers have some serious thinking to do over the next week on the scope, duration and lethality of U.S. military action against the organization calling itself the Islamic State. To date, the president has relied upon the Article II powers that are granted to his office by the U.S. Constitution, such as the ability of the Commander-in-Chief to take limited military action when U.S. citizens are at risk. Just this past weekend, President Obama ordered the U.S. Air Force to pummel Islamic State checkpoints, armored trucks, and mortar positions to break a two-month siege of a small, agricultural Turkomen town that was cut off nearly all attempts to bring in food, water, and medical supplies to the people who lived there. In this case, the need to ensure that a genocide didn't occur was given as the sole explanation for the latest bombing. U.S. Central Command has conducted nearly 120 airstrikes as of August 31, 2014. The number may seem high, but the military force that President Obama has used thus far is confined to specific geographical areas in northern Iraq in danger of being taken over by the jihadists, such as Irbil, the Mosul Dam, and now the Iraqi village of Amerli. As long as the U.S. Air Force is employed in this way, the White House can claim that it has all of the legal authority it needs under Article II to defend U.S. national security interests and the safety of American citizens and facilities in the region. Indeed, members of Congress have been relatively quiet on the president's decision to launch the full weight of the U.S. Armed Forces, and when they have spoken about it, they tend to support the president's legal argument.If the Obama administration, on the other hand, finds it necessary to expand U.S. military activity against the Islamic State into Syria (a choice it will have to make if there is any possibility of degrading the organization's military capability in the short-term), President Obama will quickly face a wave of pressure on Capitol Hill on the need to submit a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force for congressional debate and approval. In fact, the push for greater congressional buy-in is already there, with Senators Tim Kaine (D - VA), Chris Murphy (D - CT) and Bob Corker (R - TN) lobbying for a vote. ""I have long stressed that Congress must formally approve the initiation of significant military action,"" Kaine expressed in a written statement. ""[I]t is what the framers of the Constitution intended, and Congress and the Executive have a responsibility to do the hard work to build a political consensus in support of our military missions."" Sen. Murphy was even more blunt in an interview with Yahoo News on Sunday, August 31: ""We have to pass a new authorization [for use] of military force in order to continue hostilities against ISIS."" After getting embarrassed last summer when both houses of Congress were increasingly reluctant to grant President Obama the authority to retaliate against Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons on civilians, the White House is no doubt reluctant to try the same route again. Any AUMF request in an election year will inevitably seen by Democrat lawmakers in tough election contests as a politically amateurish thing for a Democratic president to do to his own party. And Republicans in Congress will attempt to use any AUMF vote as a way to remind Americans going to the polls in November about the president's (and by extension, the Democratic Party's) poor numbers on foreign policy.  John Shinkle/POLITICOBut fear aside, Obama should go directly to Congress for a new AUMF -- that is, if he plans to embark on the kind of large-scale, comprehensive anti-IS strategy in both Iraq and Syria that his own Secretary of State, John Kerry, pushed for in an August 29 New York Times op-ed. Doing so would meet several objectives, the first being a much-needed clarification on the legal underpinnings that guide the use of U.S. military force against a constantly amorphous and evolving international terrorist enemy. The 2001 AUMF, which was a mere 60 words passed overwhelmingly three days after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, has been on the books for nearly thirteen years and has been stretched to the breaking point in order to accommodate threats emanating from al Qaeda associates and affiliates. Although the Islamic State may have been the spawn of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's Al-Qaeda in Iraq, the very public breakup between Ayman al-Zawahiri and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi means that the 2001 AUMF cannot be used as the domestic legal basis of an anti-IS military campaign (it's difficult for even the most clever constitution lawyer to argue that a document justifying the targeting of al Qaeda could be used to target a group that wasn't formed until 2004). Only a new authorization could resolve the outstanding questions that legal scholars and lawmakers continue to have on the war powers issue post-9/11.Secondly, going to Congress to obtain buy-in would provide the president with the bipartisan, domestic backing that only the people's representatives can provide on the eve of a major military operation. If the United States works best when it speaks with one voice, as President Obama said last summer, allowing lawmakers to have an open, objective and healthy national debate before voting is only appropriate. Finally, a new AUMF directed solely against the Islamic State would serve an incredibly useful political function for the White House. Instead of being the one actor tied to the success or failure of a military operation, the administration would spread the responsibility and costs across two, co-equal branches of government. If things go bad for U.S. personnel or if the strategy is too slow to produce lasting damage on the terrorist group, members of Congress who clamor for action but fail to step up and vote will not be able to sit back, go on national television and engage in the familiar Monday-morning quarterbacking that has come to define contemporary Washington politics. Both branches, Congress and the White House, will own the successes and shortfalls of the operation.So the next time Obama huddles with his national security aides in the Situation Room on the subject of IS and Syria, everyone in the meeting should be able to get over the year-long flu that started in September 2013. Going to Congress, it turns out, is not only legally necessary, but politically smart."

I'm not here to debate the various terms that have been bandied about the Internet in the last few days like ""scandal"" or ""leak"" or even to discuss the gigantic breach of privacy and how violating that must be for the women involved. What I want to discuss is that this goes to prove what I have always told my children, that if you share something via the Internet or any other means of electronic sharing, there is always the possibility that someone other than the person you intend to will see it.Is it right? Absolutely not.Is it reality? Absolutely.There is absolutely no such thing as a reasonable expectation of privacy when you are sharing things online.It may seem like a bit of old-fashioned wisdom. Sometimes, I think that's what we are lacking most in the world today! My grandfather used to say there was no such thing as confidential, if it's written down on a piece of paper, then anyone who is able to read will have the potential to read it. The same goes for sharing via the Internet. If you send a text message, an email, a photograph or post to social media, then you should assume that the entire world will have access to it, because that is exactly what could happen.Do I completely understand the appeal of exchanging sexy photos? Hell yes! Do I completely understand the desire to send sultry and sexy text messages to the person you are in a relationship with? Absolutely! Do I also know that those things go through servers, and clouds, and frankly use a whole lot of technology that most of us are not fully able to understand? Yes! That means there are absolutely zero chance that anyone will be leaking nude photos of me, because there are none in existence. Any sexy and sultry talk that happens between me and the one I love happens in real life, face-to-face, where the only way it's being leaked is if it's repeated by one of us (and that had better not be happening!).The only way to guarantee to prevent pregnancy is to abstain from sex. The only way to guarantee no one will see nude photos of you is to not take them to begin with.One source said the celebrity in question had long since deleted the photographs that were leaked online this weekend -- she sent them to her husband and deleted them. But guess what? They were backed up to her cloud server (or his?) and they didn't even realize it! Nothing is ever really gone in this digital age, delete doesn't mean disappear. Take a photo, send a photo, delete a photo... like it never even happened. Wrong!From the moment that my children had access to things like camera phones or laptops with webcams, I have had numerous conversations about how any photo you take can be shared, and anything that is shared can be seen by the entire world. Sharing sexy photos and sexy text messages seems like the newest version of safe sex to the generation of kids who are coming of age with it. Show him a picture of your boob, you're across town so there's no chance things will get out of hand! Send a picture of yourself in your panties, what could it hurt?I feel terrible for the women who have had their privacy violated, but the fact of the matter is if they weren't celebrities, if their names weren't names that we know, it wouldn't be front page news. If these photos were hacked from some random women's phones we wouldn't be talking about it. But since they are celebrities, and since one of those celebrities is someone that every teenage girl admires thanks to her role in The Hunger Games, we can take advantage of this opportunity to talk to our kids about the dangers that come from taking, sharing and sending risque photographs of ourselves or of others."

5,BUSINESS,"Actually, Burger King Has Been Trying To Dodge Taxes For Years",,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/burger-king-tax-dodge_n_5750220.html,,2014-09-02,"DETROIT - FEBRUARY 03: Burger King mascot, The King poses in the green room during the 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' Show at Super Bowl XL February 3, 2006 at the Gem Theatre in Detroit, Michigan. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31294240000500055bed6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Tom BerginLONDON, Sept. 2 (Reuters) - Burger King may have taken a lot of flack in the past week for a deal that should curb its U.S. tax bill but in many ways it is consistent with the burger chain's aggressive tax-reduction strategies in recent years.Some U.S. lawmakers and other critics attacked the company that is the home of the Whopper for deciding to move its tax base to Canada from the U.S. through its proposed purchase of Oakville, Ontario-based coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons . They say it will allow Burger King to avoid paying some U.S. taxes.That would be nothing new. A Reuters analysis of Burger King's regulatory filings in the U.S. and overseas, which was also reviewed by accounting experts, shows that it has been making major efforts to reduce its U.S. tax bill for some time.By massaging down U.S. taxable profits while maximizing the profits it reports in low-tax jurisdictions overseas, Burger King is able to operate one of the most tax-efficient businesses in the U.S. fast-food industry.The chain's effective tax rate of 26 percent over the past three years compares with rates above 31 percent at McDonalds Corp, Starbucks Corp and Dunkin Brands Group Inc. KFC and Pizza Hut owner Yum Brands did have a similar tax rate to Burger King though this reflects the 74 pct of its revenues that were generated outside the U.S., in markets where tax rates are typically around 25 percent.The Burger King rate is 30 percent lower than the average tax rate it paid in the five years before it was bought in 2010 by private equity group 3G, still the company's majority shareholder.The accounting experts say the Canadian move will allow Burger King to double-down on those efforts as it will open up new tax-saving opportunities for the company. It could, for example, apply the tax structures it currently employs in major markets like Germany and Britain, and which allow the group to operate almost tax free in those places, to its business in the United States, they said.And that could mean Uncle Sam will lose corporate tax income that Burger King would have to pay under its current structure.""I would be surprised if in five years' time, their tax rate does not come down reasonably dramatically,"" said Professor Stephen Shay, from Harvard Law School, who has testified to Congress on corporate taxation.Burger King declined to comment on its current U.S. tax arrangements. But it has said the so-called ""inversion"" deal to buy Tim Hortons for $11.5 billion, and move the headquarters to Canada, was based on Canada being the combined company's biggest market. It said the deal was about international expansion - particularly of the Tim Hortons' brand and not about tax savings.""We don't expect our tax rate to change materially. As I said this transaction is not really about tax, it's about growth,"" Chief Executive Daniel Schwartz said in a call with analysts last week.It would be perfectly legal for Burger King to reduce its U.S. tax bill through the Canadian move. Chas Roy-Chowdhury, Head of Taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants in London, said companies all over the world manage their tax bills so they don't have to pay more tax than necessary.""If the U.S. doesn't like inversion deals, it should change the law to prevent them. The U.S. has a leaky corporation tax system which encourages companies to park profits offshore,"" he said. U.S. MARGINS LOWFinding ways to report less income to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and more to overseas tax authorities is a particular focus for companies with a headquarters or big operations in the U.S. because of the headline federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent on profits. It is the highest headline corporate tax rate in any major developed country, and can be even higher once state and local taxes are added on. There is an incentive for companies to shift U.S.-generated profits overseas, where rates can be very low, the experts say.Burger King generated almost 60 percent of its revenues in the United States between 2011 and 2013, regulatory filings show, but the chain reported just 20 percent of its profits in the country over the period.By contrast, the percentage of their profits that McDonalds, Starbucks Corp, Dunkin Brands and Yum reported as being earned in the United States was in line with the percentage of their total revenues generated in the country.Those companies all declined to comment.Shay said Burger King's large debt load could explain why it has more ability to manage its U.S. tax bill than less leveraged peers.Burger King's low reported U.S. profit translates to domestic profit margins of just an average 4 percent between 2011-2013 - a fifth of the level it recorded in overseas markets in that time. The company declined to say why its U.S. operation enjoyed such low margins over the period - it reported a small U.S. loss in 2012 and a tiny profit for 2011, though the profit was up to a much healthier level by 2013.There could be explanations other than tax-driven moves for the low margins. The U.S. fast food market is the most competitive in the world, and prices for fast food offerings are lower than in some other major markets as a result. However, a lot of the burden, including increased labor costs as the minimum wages rises in some states and spending on a refurbishment program for Burger King restaurants, would be borne by the company's franchisees. Burger King operates very few of its own restaurants.Professor Daniel Shaviro from New York University Law School, who was previously Legislation Attorney at the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation, said tax planning likely had a lot to do with the low levels of income reported in the U.S.The company's accounts show the low reported U.S margins are due, at least in part, to how hundreds of millions of dollars in group overheads, such as head office and debt costs are spread across the company each year.Before such costs are applied, profit margins at Burger King's United States and Canada division (the U.S. produces 91 percent of that unit's revenue) are in line with international operations, at around 39 percent, its filings show. But after these costs are applied, the North American unit ends up with its rock-bottom margins.Most of these costs are taken in the U.S. because it is where cash is borrowed, and senior managers and product innovators are based. But tax rules state that such costs should be evenly spread across international divisions, said Kimberly Clausing, a Professor of Economics at Reed University.Reed said the gap between Burger King's gross and pre-tax profit figures for the United States suggested such group-wide costs are being disproportionately offset against U.S. income.""That's one way of shifting income abroad ... it's a common problem,"" for the IRS, said Reed. TAX FREE IN GERMANYBurger King also operates a tax-efficient operation overseas. By channeling income through Switzerland it has managed to pay an effective tax rate of 15 percent on foreign income over the past three years, company filings and statements show.Experts said this arrangement could become a template for how Burger King, as a foreign company, could shave its U.S. tax rate further.The impact in Germany shows how that could cost the U.S. Treasury.Germany has historically been Burger King's largest market outside North America, generating over 10 percent of total sales. In 2011 and 2012, the last two years for which figures were available, the German operation had combined sales of $501 million - over half the total for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, regulatory filings show.In 10 conference calls with analysts covering the two-year period, transcripts of which Reuters reviewed, then-Chief Financial Officer Schwartz mentioned the German market eight times, and each time spoke of its ""strong performance"" or ""positive"" results.EMEA operating profits for 2011 and 2012 totaled $356 million. Yet, Burger King Beteilligung GmbH - the entity which consolidated earnings for the group's main German operating units - reported losses in 2011 and 2012, totaling over $10 million and recorded a net income tax credit of more than 200,000 euros.Burger King Germany's taxable income was reduced partly because German stores pay around five percent of their turnover to an affiliate in Switzerland, Burger King Europe GmbH, the company told Reuters in 2012.Burger King Europe GmbH owns brand rights for Europe, the Middle East and Africa - which also allows profits from other places, not just Germany, to be at least partly funneled through Switzerland. Burger King declined to say why the group declared no profits in Germany at the same time as it boasted to investors about the market's strength, but a spokeswoman said the tax structure in Europe pre-dated New-York based 3G's acquisition of the chain in 2010.Almost all of Burger King's restaurants are now run on a franchise basis rather than directly by the company, and more than 80 percent of the company's revenue comes from franchise fees and property revenue. At the end of last year, it had 7,384 franchised restaurants in the U.S. and 52 company owned and run - the latter are in the Miami area near the company's current headquarters so it can test new food offerings and other changes to the way it operates.Under U.S. tax rules, Burger King cannot currently cut its American tax bill by routing franchise fees from its U.S. franchisees via Switzerland. But these rules would not apply to a Canadian company. The company spokeswoman said Burger King had no plans to shift franchisees into contracts with offshore subsidiaries.

(Photo by Franziska Krug/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb47814250000360038f7eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last month, Ute Lemper, the famed singer and interpreter of works by Kurt Weill, Jacques Brel, Edith Piaf and more, extended her repertoire with the release of her latest album, ""Forever: The Love Poems of Pablo Neruda."" Recently set to music by Lemper and her collaborators, she is now sharing these poems live with the world through a series of performances, include a brief run this week at the New York City cabaret venue, 54 Below.I had a chance to catch up with Lemper, who took a break from another recording session to talk about her passion for this latest project and excitement for the upcoming performances at 54 Below.Lemper explains that as a performer often associated with the works of deceased songwriters and singers, she yearned to have a new collection of music written just for her. She knew that, she ""wanted to take something from literature. Like the French and their tradition of taking great literature and poetry and putting it to music."" However, she explained that the works had to be meticulously selected for a memorable and lasting impression. ""Not some kind of day-to-day lyrics, but something a bit more truly poetic.""How she landed on the works of Neruda was in careful study of South American poets, as she felt drawn to his work. ""First of all,"" she explained enthusiastically, ""his life's mission was to fight against fascism, even in exile. His vision was a very political one, rather like [Bertolt] Brecht (German poet and playwright), he was striving for the freedom of people and equality for all... Yet, he had to live in exile for many many years. He was not just a poet, he was a diplomat, he was an ambassador. He was a political person who at the same time made politics with his poetry and through his persona, spoke out.""Although impressed by and attracted to his hunger for equality, despite unimaginable challenges, Lemper made clear that ""for some reason, I did not really get too much into his political poetry, but rather stayed in the human poetry that were filled with the sensation of love, thirst and hunger for life.""This album, as with much of Lemper's work, features Neruda's poems in several different languages, including Spanish, French and English. When asked how she feels this will be received, especially at the upcoming performances at 54 Below where the audience will be - at most - bi-lingual, Lemper said that she thinks it part of her appeal. ""Especially in New York, I have a very sophisticated international audience who really appreciates the original versions and sounds of these languages from other parts of the world. It's very natural in Europe [where Lemper often plays larger venues] to do this as people speak several languages.""That said, Lemper added, that she hopes it will be of interest to the U.S.' large Hispanic population, due to the exceptional appreciation of his work in South America and Spain. ""It is so amazing to see that this poet had such an impact... there are so many people here from Brazil to Argentina, Chile and Mexico that hopefully they will embrace this concept and performance, too.""Lemper, who typically fills symphony halls and other large venues admits, ""It's very unusual for me to play clubs. I really only do it in New York, because I live here and I love to perform in my city and be present. I love the directness of course with the audience - sometimes I get a little scared, because it's so close to people... it has almost a spiritual realm but the directness of it is fantastic because you really see every moment of emotion. The audience can witness that, and follow through the emotions with me.Ute Lemper performs at New York's 54 Below through September 6, for additional date, locations and information visit www.utelemper.com."

Aside from all the other physical changes that we deal with, do we become more protective of our feelings?",2014-09-02,Young woman holding a placard reflecting her feelings,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e43de2100003100c5da2f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Emotional constipation is a term that my siblings and I made up when we were teens. (Little did we know it was a term that already existed.) We came up with it because we felt that people around us wouldn't let their feelings show, they kept them bottled up inside and wouldn't let them out. Maybe it was a generational thing because today I do feel that our parents' generation keep their feeling inside a lot more than our children do.People, who can't just enjoy the beautiful day or laugh at themselves or even just act silly are emotionally constipated -- that's what I thought. And then I turned 40! As adults we run far away from our raw and real feelings. Our lives become a culmination of artificial smiles and inflated egos. I catch myself being that way as an adult now, even though I pride myself as someone who wears her heart on her sleeve. I still am not fully transparent as I wish I could be. Why is that? What is our biggest fear? It's so great to see children just being who they are without being so vested in how the outside world perceives them. They laugh, cry and act silly, if they want to. Nothing seems to crush their spirit, and joy lives in their hearts.As adults do we just become emotionally constipated, is it an age-related characteristic? Do we lock up our insecurities and joys because we fear what people will think? Aside from all the other physical changes that we deal with, do we become more protective of our feelings? Do we hide behind the shield of our egos and the facade of having everything under control? Why can't we allow others to see how we feel? Why can't our emotions just run freely? As I turned 40, I did feel a lot better about how I look and the person I had become, but am I more fearful of making a fool of myself now? Yes, definitely. I keep my emotions inside and try to always remain ""in control,"" which truthfully I feel like is an unrealistic term. Have I also become one of those people I laughed at growing up who had issues showing their feelings or maybe I am just simply"" emotionally constipated"" too!"

Candidates, strategists, and pundits will vie for the spotlight from now until November 4. Yet try as they might, midterms never garner as much attention as presidential cycles.This year's election, though, matters more than most.The outcome of the 2014 races could have a major impact on the air we breathe, the health of our families, and the intensity of the climate change outside our doors.Victory could come for candidates who take millions of dollars for fossil fuel companies and ignore the climate threat -- I call these folks the Dirty Denier$. Or environmental champions will triumph and expand clean energy and climate action to protect our health and create jobs.The choices we make in the voting booth always carry weight, but they have even greater heft in a year when control of the Senate is up for grabs, when GOP leaders have promised to roll back decades-worth of public health and environmental safeguards, and when the threat of climate change grows more severe.Here are five forces that could shape the outcome of the 2014 midterm.Climate Denial Is Alive and Well in the GOPTwo weeks ago, Scott Brown was asked if ""the theory of man-made climate change has been scientifically proven."" His reply: ""Uh, no."" Yet when Brown was campaigning for Senator from Massachusetts in 2012, he said, ""I absolutely believe that climate change is real and I believe there's a combination between man-made and natural."" Now that he is running in New Hampshire, he backpedalled. Brown isn't alone. Across the nation, Republicans either deny the existence of human-caused climate change or feign ignorance because they aren't trained scientists. If these lawmakers gain a majority, they will try at every turn to stop the Obama Administration from fulfilling the President's Climate Action Plan.McConnell Would Use a Majority to Dismantle SafeguardsSince 2010, GOP lawmakers in the House have voted several hundred times to undermine public health and environmental protections. They haven't just gone after measures associated with President Obama. They've dug deep and torn into the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and other bedrock laws that have held firm for four decades. The only thing stopping these radical bills from becoming law? A lack of support in the Senate. But Senator Mitch McConnell says if he wins a majority, he will launch his own attack, using bills and policy riders to strip away protections that keep our water clean and our air safe to breathe. He will also wage an assault on every effort to shield our communities from climate change. And he's willing to even shut down the government to implement his radical agenda.Fossil Fuel Companies Are Looking for Better ResultsOil and gas companies and their allies have spent more than $31 million on this election already. They favor lawmakers who put industry concerns before the public interest. Senator Marco Rubio, Representative Fred Upton, Senator Mitch McConnell and other Dirty Denier$ have accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars each from the fossil fuel industry. They have also voted for oil and gas subsidies and tried to prevent the EPA from finalizing limits on climate change pollution from power plants -- the nation's largest source of carbon emissions. But industry investments don't always pay off. The US Chamber of Commerce, known for its climate denial and fossil-fuel friendly policies, spent more than $32 million in the 2012 election but achieved less than 7 percent of desired outcomes.Smart Candidates Are Running CleanIt turns out voters prefer leaders who stand up to polluters. In the 2012 cycle, candidates who supported clean energy and climate action won up and down the ticket, even in contested purple states. Recent polling shows that sentiment is growing. More than two-thirds of voters in 11 battleground states say the EPA should limit carbon pollution from power plants, according to a March poll done by Harstad Strategic Research for the NRDC Action Fund. The poll was conducted in red and purple states, and still 53 percent of Republicans, 63 percent of independents and 87 percent of Democrats supported carbon limits. Many 2014 candidates -- including Michigan's Gary Peters, Colorado's Mark Udall, and New Hampshire's Jeanne Shaheen -- have recognized that running for office on a platform of protecting the environment, promoting clean sources of energy, and curbing climate change is a proven winner.Environmental Champions Could Make Climate HistoryPresident Obama has called on the EPA to do the single most important thing the US can to fight climate change right now: limit carbon pollution from power plants. These plants kick out 40 percent of all carbon emissions in the country, and cleaning them up will help us defuse the climate threat. An environmental majority in Congress will help the EPA realize this goal. It would also help expand renewable power and strengthen environmental safeguards. Lawmakers could point to these accomplishments and say: this is when America began combating climate change and building the clean energy future."

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d48a2000000f0201d264.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We can now see what happens when the United States retreats from global leadership: ISIS and Vladimir Putin. Aggressors challenge the status quo and try to change the world map. ISIS aims to unite the Muslim world in a global caliphate. Putin wants ""self-determination"" for ethnic Russians everywhere, which could lead to reconstitution of the old Czarist and Soviet empires.U.S. retrenchment is leaving a vacuum. Aggressors are moving to take advantage of it. When President Harry Truman announced the Truman Doctrine in 1947, the U.S. abandoned its historic isolationism and became the principal guarantor of international order. Since World War II, whenever there has been a serious threat to world order, the rule has been that unless the United States responds, nothing will be done.What would have happened if the United States failed to act after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990? Most likely, Kuwait would now be part of Iraq. Having acted decisively in Kuwait, the first President Bush left the crisis in Bosnia to the Europeans. The U.S. had no vital interests there. So what happened? The Europeans failed to act, and a new horror entered the world's vocabulary: ""ethnic cleansing."" Eventually, the U.S. felt morally compelled to step in and lead a coalition to end the brutality.When atrocities occurred in Cambodia, Rwanda, Congo and Darfur, the whole world -- including the United States -- looked away. So nothing happened. The result was genocide. After he left office, President Clinton expressed regret for America's failure to act in Africa. If the U.S. had not led an invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the Taliban would still be in power. The Taliban will very likely try to come back to power when the U.S. withdraws. It is unlikely that Muammar Qaddafi's murderous reprisals could have been stopped in Libya if the U.S. had not played a crucial role. It is hard to imagine a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians that would not be guaranteed by the United States.Since World War II, the U.S. has acknowledged international interests as well as national interests. That's what President Clinton meant when he called the U.S. ""the world's indispensable nation"": we protect world order and international values. President Obama acknowledged our international interests when he said in 2009, ""The plain fact is this: the United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms.""A year ago, during the debate over whether to strike Syria, President Obama's deputy national security adviser Benjamin Rhodes told The New York Times, ""One thing for Congress to consider is the message that this debate sends about U.S. leadership around the world-- that the U.S. for decades has played the role of undergirding the global security architecture and enforcing international norms. We do not want to send a message that the United States is getting out of that business in any way.""The problem is, that's exactly the message many Americans do want to send. A Pew poll taken for the Council on Foreign Relations in December 2013 found a majority of Americans (52 percent) endorsing the view that the U.S. should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along as best they can on their own. That was the highest level of isolationism in 40 years.This summer's crises may be producing a shift. In the Pew poll, the number of Americans who feel the U.S. does ""too little"" to solve world problems is up a bit, from 17 percent last November to 31 percent last month. Still, 39 percent continue to believe the U.S. is doing ""too much."" President Obama's cautious, deliberative approach is driven by both domestic and international politics. Americans are exhausted after two wars, depleted by the recession and disinclined to support any new foreign entanglements. Moreover, the rest of the world responded with relief when the U.S. elected a President with no ambitious plans to reshape the world. They were so grateful, in fact, that they awarded him the Nobel Peace Prize, essentially for not being George W. Bush. For decades, the United States has been the world's pre-eminent status quo power. The U.S. fought wars to reverse acts of aggression and restore the status quo in Kosovo and Kuwait. Now new aggressors believe they can threaten the status quo with impunity because the U.S. seems unwilling to stand up to them.President Obama said last week, ""What we are seeing is the old order not working but the new order not being born yet, and it is a rocky road and a dangerous time through that process."" The question is, what role does the U.S. intend to play in that new world order? The President added that U.S. leadership ""has never been more necessary."" Or, many observers feel, less in evidence."

Despite the clear criminality of the leak, corners of social media have regressed to the all-too-familiar victim-blaming routine, placing the blame squarely on the women for taking the photos rather than the hacker who blatantly broke the law. Just because a woman (or person of any gender for that matter) is famous does not mean their private photos are fair game to anyone and everyone. As Esquire's Luke O'Neil put it: ""Very few of us would hide in the bushes outside of a woman's home in order to catch a glimpse of her getting changed, but how is that any different from this?""Many female celebrities took to Twitter to voice their outrage and poignantly clarify why leaked photos such as these are so insidious. Some were eloquent, others were short and sweet. Either way, all are correct.Here are six reasons why leaking nude photos of famous women is wrong, straight from celebrity women themselves:1. It is -- above all -- a woman's choice with whom she shares her body with and how she does it.2. People have the right to take nude photos. No one has the right to hack them. It's that simple.3. It's just creepy.To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home, hope you feel great about yourselves.4. ""Integrity is sacred."" 4. iCloud accounts are meant to be PRIVATE -- and might need a little work done. (Translation: Piece of sh*t)5. By looking at these photos and negatively engaging in the conversation surrounding them, you are perpetuating the problem.6.

Human Rights Council which adopted a resolution tabled by Iraq and France at an emergency sitting of the 47-member state forum in Geneva.The Council aims to send 11 investigators, with a total budget of $1.18 million, to report back by March 2015.Islamic State, which declared a ""caliphate"" in June in parts of Iraq and Syria under its control, has been cited as a major security threat by Western governments since posting a video in August of the beheading of U.S journalist James Foley.The Sunni militants have driven more than 1.2 million people from their homes this year, the United Nations says. At least 1,420 people were killed in sectarian violence in Iraq in August alone, U.N. figures showed on Monday.U.N. Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Flavia Pansieri said there was ""strong evidence"" Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and allied groups had carried out targeted killings, forced conversions, sexual abuse and torture in Iraq.""The reports we have received reveal acts of inhumanity on an unimaginable scale,"" she said.ETHNIC CLEANSINGPansieri voiced concern at the persecution of Christians, Yazidis, Shia, and Turkmen, saying such ""ethnic and religious cleansing"" may amount to crimes against humanity.Children belonging to targeted minorities have been forcibly recruited and positioned on front lines to shield fighters or made to donate blood, she said. Women are beaten for breaking rules requiring them to be veiled and escorted by men.Al-Sudani told the session that Islamic State, ""oozing with barbarity"", was threatening the makeup of his country.""The land of ancient Babylon is subjected to threats, starting with threats to its very independence. They are attempting to change its demographic and cultural composition,"" he said, adding: ""Acts by ISIS threaten not only Iraq but the whole region and world.""Pansieri raised concerns that Iraqi government forces had also engaged in acts that may amount to war crimes.She said government-allied militias had opened fire on a mosque in Khanaqin district, northeast of Baghdad, killing 73 men and boys. Iraqi soldiers had shelled towns and carried out air strikes killing and injuring dozens of civilians, she added.The U.S. envoy to the rights forum, Keith Harper, urged Iraq's prime minister designate, Haider al-Abadi, to form a multi-ethnic government that would investigate allegations against government forces and ""terrorist groups"".""The stories that have emerged from ISIL's bloody assault on Iraq are the ones of nightmares. Christians and others have been driven from their homes with the threat of 'convert or die',"" Harper said.""The Yazidis have been buried alive, beheaded or killed in mass executions.""Al Sudani, asked whether the U.N. investigators would look into alleged crimes by government forces, said they would focus on those committed by the Sunni militants and that the Baghdad government would look into allegations against state forces.""These are allegations of crimes perpetrated by the government and we have a transparent investigation by our own government which will soon be deposited with all concerned members of the Human Rights Council,"" he told Reuters.

Williams (pictured with author) (1973-1997)With Robin Williams' shocking and devastating suicide, it brought up in me (as I am sure in many others) a great deal of feelings -- things yet unresolved, ghosts of the past, visions of a different way of carrying out our lives and a grief -- insurmountable it seems -- at how isolated this American culture is, and how we continue to stigmatize and play Barbie (e.g., treat something superficially) regarding the sincere health crisis of mental illness. I have had relationships with two men with the surname of Williams who completed suicide -- one, my fiancé. The other, someone I never met, but for whom I felt the most sincere love and appreciation for the gut laughter he brought up in me, and billions, time and again over decades. The former, Michael D. Williams (1973-1997) and the latter, of course, you know.When I was born, in the days following, I recently learned that my own mother attempted on her own life.In the aftermath of such loss, I too for a brief time understood the sorrow that seems to have no end and felt rebuke for such a world that would cast out people who share so much light with such animosity and flippancy.Perhaps the root of what we are all asking right now starts with: ""Why?"" Why would someone so beloved, so kind, someone so talented and so able to lift us up and be there, truly, whether Michael or Robin -- not famous or world famous -- both influential in their circles at an exceptional level -- why would it end this way? Why would there be such a hole, where to the outside world there is such beauty?Someone said to me a long time ago, in the wake of Michael's death, ""You can't ask why. The would ofs, the should ofs, the could ofs will make you crazy. You have to let them go."" To that I felt both a sense of wisdom and one of impossibility. It was not in my nature to simply toss off why suicide would be a viable option -- and such a drastic, unexpected, utterly devastating one for all those left behind.But the fact is that we don't legitimately evaluate depression and mental illness, nor do we form a true support system for those who are experiencing it. In fact, at least 20 percent of our prison population is mentally ill. Prisons have become de facto asylums. Seventy percent of youth in juvenile justice systems have at least one mental health condition and again, at least 20 percent live with a severe mental illness.To be not OK became very much not OK a long time ago, in the massive drive for progress and profit, for caffeine-driven success stories, for a society that has literally itself gone mad in its rush for success and in its blind progress that is plowing over our sacred Earth. Until we begin to give full respect to brain disorders as legitimate illnesses we will continue to be left in the wake of these tremendous losses. And even then, our neurochemistry -- our very brains -- are perhaps the last frontier we've yet to fully understand. Our medical science has made great progress, and yet we stand deluded in the face of mental illnesses and treat them, dumb them down, and cast out those who display symptoms that we can't frame with our neat and tidy little DSM manuals. And we pretend that everything is hunky dory. That we are this land of the free. That even though we live in isolated single family units and drive -- singly -- our little cars to work five days a week and back, and only rarely have free time to explore nature agenda-less, without a hungry-ghost need to buy, buy, buy, that it's all progressing where we think it should. But it's not. Simply it's not. Are we kidding ourselves in thinking that our lives could not be more than what this U.S. corporation tells us? Do we really think that this is the best it is going to get? Why is it surprising that we have this strange irony of putting people -- people just like ourselves, same needs, same wants, same hopes -- up on pedestals, and then cringe when they fall? How odd the nuance and paradox at play here in the American culture, and how devastating.The Michael and Robin Williams I knew were sincere men. My mother was trying to kick her own fears and escape the past darkness laid upon her. Michael and Robin had a recipe not uncommon for those with creative genius, with authentic kindness -- a sensitivity and a brilliance far surpassing what may be called typical. A magnetism that drew people in. An ability to shine light in lives and to make true connections. A fearlessness that signaled a faith in something greater than this reality. And yet, a dense and dark viscosity that was not helped by a fateful combination unique to each of them: neurochemistry, circumstance, culture, and soul, to name a few. For one, addiction was the cross to bear. For the other, a fear of repeating a perceived burden of depression on his family.For both, an extraordinary life contributing, in the hours we contemplate what truly matters, to the light, affirming life, providing hope and faith's augmentation, even in the dire darkness.With this sadness I pray that we as a humanity look beyond our limited thinking, just as Einstein, just as Tesla, just as Copernicus, to the aspects of human experience that underlie such pain -- to the very real brain illnesses that make people do things they normally wouldn't do -- to the contrasts we sit back aghast at and wonder -- how could such light go down in such darkness. And then treat them and hold them with utmost respect and understanding.Let us look as well at the cycles of intergenerational wounding and violence -- some of it subtle, some of it not so, and how it informs our current generations. Let us also look from the lens that Indigenous cultures regard as old hat -- that we are a significant but also small part of a much greater story: one that extends beyond this reality -- one that is informed by experiences that our ancestors and relatives had long ago, and that healing and freedom can be non-linear, and expand beyond death's doors. We can collectively address our own tendencies as humans to need dichotomy, separation, us/them, punishments and shame, in order for our learning to occur. Viktor Frankl said, ""What is to give light must endure burning."" I believe we are progressing towards a place where, full circle, we are remembering who we are in the story -- both as a collective and as individuals. But when there is suffering, and great loss, and our hands are tied, we stand at the precipice along with those we've lost.And for that burning and that solitary confinement that these two Williams endured, although it was ultimately that they both were to leave of their own hand, it is the immensity of their love, their contributions to this world, that make them unforgettable across eternity.I believe it would be both their wishes, and you can call me a blaspheme, that we learn something -- sooner than later -- from their lives, from the millions upon millions of lives that are the extraordinary, unfathomable paradoxes in our hearts -- not here any longer, but so much here forevermore. The echoes of their lives call forth to make our ""lives extraordinary,"" and use losses like these for the catalyst that sparks an entirely new respect, and treatment, of depression, of the mentally ill, and of life as we know it in this American culture.---Have a story about depression that you'd like to share?

18,GREEN,Creating a Chemically-Free Home Is Easier and Cheaper Than You Think,"Lee Holmes, ContributorAuthor of Supercharged Food, Heal Your Gut and Eat Yourself Be...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/creating-a-chemically-fre_b_5689389.html,Have you noticed how laboratory-made cleaning fumes are marketed as being able to wipe out any offending bacteria or germ?  All you need to do is take a trip down the cleaning aisle of your local supermarket to see how many different products there are to choose from.,2014-09-01,2014-08-18-CleaningRecipesfrontpageallpurposecleaner.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-18-CleaningRecipesfrontpageallpurposecleaner-thumb.jpg,"Swap out chemically-laden, corrosive, toxic products with natural alternatives and not only will you be making your family healthier, you'll be helping the planet too.  Have you noticed how laboratory-made cleaning fumes are marketed as being able to wipe out any offending bacteria or germ? All you need to do is take a trip down the cleaning aisle of your local supermarket to see how many different products there are to choose from. But seriously the effects of the toxic ingredients contained within most cleaning and skincare products will astound you and worse still, the accumulation of these toxins in our bodies can lead to poor health. Widespread use of anti-bacterial cleaning products is also linked to the alarming increase in allergies also known as the hygiene hypothesis and continued use of them could place you and your family at risk of accumulated toxins. If you're wondering what goes into many store-bought cleaners, check out this short list of home cleaners and the toxic substances they contain:Oven Cleaners contain ingredients such as ethylene glycol, ethers, lye (sodium and potassium hydroxide), methylene chloride and ammonia. These substances are highly corrosive to the skin and eyes, and, when inhaled, can affect internal organs. If you do use oven cleaners the best thing to do is to ensure that you are wearing heavy rubber gloves, an apron and goggles to protect your skin from the effects. Disinfectants contain the immunotoxicants cresol, phenol, ethanol, and formaldehyde, which reduce the ability of the immune system to fight the germs they are killing and can contribute to asthma. l It takes over twelve months to eliminate the toxic effects of spraying ¼ cup of disinfectant in the home. The best alternative for disinfecting is distilled vinegar and lemon.Air Fresheners release a constant amount of artificial fragrance into a room to create an intoxicating aroma. But the fragrances in all air fresheners are not only intoxicating they can actually affect your sense of smell as they release nerve-deadening agents and leave oil build up in nasal passages. The agent which is used is known as methoxychlor, a pesticide that can accumulate in the body in the fat cells and can also over-stimulate the central nervous system, leaving you jittery and anxious. If you're looking for a natural air freshener why not try burning essential oils, dried spices or citrus juices they smell beautiful without the harmful side effects.Toilet bowl cleaners these innocent looking little hanging ducks contain ferocious cleaning chemicals especially as they tend to be lodged under the bowl of the smallest room of the house and usually a room that is unventilated. The ingredients are typically oxalic acid, hydrochloric acid, lye (caustic soda) and naphthalene. A good alternative cleaner to use is baking soda and neat vinegar which will remove stains and rings from around the toilet. Glass cleaners contain a mixture of ammonia and water. When you are cleaning away it's very easy to inhale the vapors as you spray it onto windows or glass. The best solution for squeaky clean glass and windows is using distilled white vinegar and using elbow grease buff with scrunched up newspaper. Bleachers inhalation of chlorine and chemical vapors is known to be a strong irritant to the tissues in our lungs and a suspected cause of asthma and bronchitis. When laboratory workers handle it they use protective gloves, face masks and they always make sure working areas have adequate ventilation. Even aware of the dangers doesn't stop chlorine from being used freely in many cleaners such as laundry detergent, dishwashing liquid and hand cleaning liquids. It's also an ingredient in our drinking water and is used in pools and spas to purify the water. The best and healthiest option to a healthy home is to use natural alternatives that do just as good a job of cleaning your home without having to look down upon withered cuticles and flimsy nails. Let's look at the ingredients of a typical dishwashing detergent to see the kinds of chemicals it contains: • Aqua • Sodium laureth sulphate • Alcohol denat • Lauramine oxide • C9-11 pareth-8 • Sodium chloride • 1, 3-Cyclohexanedimethanamine • PPG (polypropylene glycols)  • Dimethyl aminoethyl methecrylate/hydroxyproply acrylate copolymer cirate • Parfum • Geraniol • Limonene • ColourantWithout getting too technical, many of these ingredients can cause irritation to the skin, eyes and mucous membranes. The perfumes are allergens for many people and the alcohols, sodium laureth sulphate and C9-11 pareth 8, can be contaminated with the carcinogen 1, 4 dioxane. When you combine the detergent with hot water it creates chemical vapors which you are breathing in and inhaling as steam, therefore drawing the chemicals right into your body, causing severe irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract. All of these chemicals are then poured down the drain, and could eventually end up polluting our environment and endangering our animals.Natural products are truly all you need to clean and sanitize your home without the toxic by-products of their chemical counterparts. The best cleaning products that are inexpensive and easy to find at your local supermarket are bicarbonate of soda, lemons, distilled white vinegar, alcohol, essential oils and olive oil. Use the following ingredients to add natural spark to your home and your health!Baking Soda  Baking soda cleans as well as deodorizes. It can be used to scrub the film and grease off surfaces as well as furniture and carpets. If you place baking soda in the bottom of your bin it will soak up unnecessary smells and deodorize the bin. You can also place in a box in the refrigerator and freezer to absorb odors. Vinegar  Vinegar is a fantastic all-purpose cleaner, disinfectant and deodorizer and can be used all over the house in many different areas in particular the bathroom and diluted as a floor cleaner. It can be used to clean the stove top, kitchen bench, appliances and surfaces. Use I cup of vinegar to one of water and place into a spray bottle. It can be used neat on the toilet and on tile grout to clean. The vinegar smell will dissipate when it dries. In the laundry vinegar can be used as a fabric softener. Just add ½ cup.Lemon Juice  Lemon juice is fantastic at dissolving soap scum and hard water deposits, scrubbing dishes, surfaces and stains and can be mixed in with baking soda to create a cleaning paste. Lemon cleans brass and copper leaving it shiny and smear free. I like to put a lemon in the refrigerator to soak up all the smells and deodorize the fridge.Now for the fun part...How to make your own cleaning products:Here are just a few items you will need to get started:• Plastic spray bottles in various sizes • Glass jars with screw-top lids • Cotton cloths  • RagsAll Purpose CleanerThis can be used on most surfaces and for so many areas of the home. To give the cleaner a beautiful scent when cleaning just add 10 drops of essential oil, which will make the house smell amazing.   1 tablespoon soap (plant based is good) 1 litre hot water ¼ cup white distilled vinegar 1 lemon squeezed 10 drops of essential oil for fragranceMix together and pour into a cleaner trigger spray bottle shake carefully until mixed. Then use as a spray and wipe down surfaces. Furniture & Floor Polishes1/4 cup of Olive Oil ¼ cup of lemon juiceThe best way to polish an item is to use an equal mixture of olive oil and lemon juice and apply with a soft cloth to furniture. Mayonnaise is also highly effective.Automatic Dishwasher Detergent1/2 cup liquid plant or animal fat based soap 1/2 cup warm water 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice 4 drops tea tree oil 1/4 cup distilled white vinegarMix together soap, water, lemon, tea tree and vinegar  Pour into squeeze bottle.

(Photo by Halis Akyildiz/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ee572100002501c91aff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Concerned for the safety of U.S. citizens soon headed to Mecca, 27 Muslim-American groups are asking the State Department to better protect them from violence that has plagued those who have made the pilgrimage in the past.A letter from the group sent Tuesday (Aug. 26) to Secretary of State John Kerry was prompted in part by a 2013 incident in which a group of Sunni Muslims from Australia threatened to kill and rape a group of Shiites from Michigan.The letter reads:“We urge you to take immediate action to protect American citizens who travel overseas to perform one of the five mandatory acts of their faith and ensure that Saudi Arabia addresses this urgent security matter in preparation for the upcoming Hajj pilgrimage.”The pilgrimage to Islam’s most sacred place is required of all Muslims who are physically and financially able to make the journey to Mecca. The hajj takes place during the 12th month of the Islamic year and typically attracts 2 million or more faithful annually. This year it falls during the first week of October.Last year, when the Michigan Muslims were attacked, neither Saudi nor U.S. authorities were responsive to their plight, said Mohamed Sabur of the Oakland-based Muslim Advocates, one of the groups that signed on to the letter.U.S. Muslims on the hajj “need to know that the State Department has their backs,” Sabur said.A State Department representative said in an email that the U.S. is committed to the protection of its citizens traveling or living abroad.“We take seriously all reports of attacks or threats against U.S. citizens, including the reported attack on U.S. citizens during last year’s Hajj.”The email statement continued: “While the U.S. does not have law enforcement personnel at the Hajj, our Embassy and Consulate General in Saudi Arabia are in close contact with their Saudi government counterparts. We urge all U.S. citizens traveling or residing abroad to register their location and contact information at https://step.state.gov/step.”For most, the hajj is safe. But the huge gathering holds inherent risks, despite high-tech Saudi crowd control and anti-terrorism efforts, which include thousands of closed-circuit television cameras. The main danger in past years has been from stampedes: Between 1990 and 2004, more than 2,000 people were trampled to death on the hajj.After last year’s attack, the Americans reported that Saudi authorities at first seemed ready to help, but then destroyed a video of the incident and otherwise made it clear that they would not follow up on the matter.The Americans identified their attackers as Salafis — Sunnis who embrace a strict form of Islam that is widely practiced in Saudi Arabia.The Americans also reported that the response from the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia was slow and disappointing.“When they relied on the U.S. State Department, they didn’t come through, either,” said Sabur.Thomas Farr, director of the Religious Freedom Project at Georgetown University’s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, said the Muslim-Americans’ request is “entirely fair.”It’s “a central responsibility of the U.S. government to defend the rights of its citizens abroad, especially their right to religious freedom,” he said."

Congratulations on making it through the Hunger Games that is the first three years of college. It's a big deal to make it this far. And because it's a big deal, it's also anxiety-inducing, liberating, fulfilling, depressing, and fabulous all wrapped into one. I, for one, spent my senior year teetering between peeing my pants out of fear of the future and peeing my pants out of excitement for graduation. This is normal.As an activist, I'm a big fan of trying to institutionalize knowledge, and in the interest of doing so, I want to pass along a bit of advice about life. Because I'm a recent graduate, the triumphs and tribulations of senior year are still fresh in my mind, and with all the infinite wisdom that is conferred upon me by three months out of college, it's a big deal that I'm passing along my sage advice to you. You should definitely cherish all of this advice, because I have a college degree, and you don't yet, so trust me when I say that I know best.So without any further fanfare, I present to you the five dos and don'ts of senior year.The DosMentor younger students (particularly younger queer students).As a senior, mentoring younger students isn't just something that you can do; it's something that only you can do. Every year first-year students are just as confused, ambitious, and anxious as you were at their age. And I'll bet that when you were a first-year student, some older students took some time out of their busy schedules to help you out. Now is your time to pay it forward. Mentoring younger students -- particularly younger queer students -- can make the difference between a first-year student becoming a leader on campus or transferring. I was this close to transferring during my first year and was only able to get through it because I had fantastic third- and fourth-year students who helped me out.Hold your friends accountable.During senior year recruiters for major corporations, graduate programs, and other opportunities will be swarming campus trying to scoop up fantastic young talent. For some of your friends, these paths will be the right ones to choose. Others will be tempted to put aside their convictions and passions and pursue opportunities simply for a salary. When your friends are facing these sorts of decisions, it can be hard to be honest with them about the implications of the choices they're making, but true friends hold each other accountable. It may be tough, but you need to confront your friends when they're thinking of signing up for a postgraduate opportunity without some critical thought about whether it's really the right fit and will make them truly happy.Write a thesis (if you can bear it).Writing a thesis isn't glamorous, and at times it's ridiculous -- like, super ridiculous. I wrote a history thesis, and my thesis was 180-plus pages. Like, what? Why would anyone ever want to cite 400 footnotes? Because despite the tediousness of it, you will grow more intellectually and personally than you ever thought possible. Writing a thesis gives you the chance to produce an original project that is yours. It will push you to put down your ideas, your words and your thoughts. Yes, it will make your brain hurt, but the mental marathon will be totally worth it in the end. (Also, you'll get like a million ""likes"" when you post a picture of the finished product on Facebook at the end of the year.)Think about the future, but don't try to control it.You can think about the future during your last year in school, but unless you're going into a graduate program or a job in finance immediately following graduation, you will very rarely be able to do anything about your future until after you graduate. The reality of most jobs in the United States is that you just have to move to the city where you want to live and try to find a job after you get there. While looking for a job, you may have to live with your parents for a while or perhaps crash on a friend's couch, but there is nothing that you can do about that at the beginning of your senior year. So think about the future, but remember that most people will not be able to plan all the steps necessary to secure it.Feel all of your feelings.During your senior year most people will pretend that they are infinitely happy and have their whole life plan together. But almost everyone is freaking out and has no idea what they're going to do next year. By being honest about your feelings, not only will you preserve your emotional health, but you'll also make hella friends. During senior year people gravitate to anyone who is willing to acknowledge that they're still figuring things out. Vulnerability and authenticity will likely make you the most-popular person on campus.  The Don'tsDon't stop learning.By the time senior year rolls around, school may have gotten pretty exhausting, and you may begin to think you know everything there is to know. This may lead you to not take your classes and learning seriously, but that would be a huge mistake. Once you get an undergraduate degree, there are few other times in your life when you'll have the opportunity to take a class out of curiosity. So learn how to edit documentary film, take a ballet class, or try your hand at astronomy. Other than fulfilling your course requirements, try to take classes that are outside your comfort zone and push you to learn something entirely new. Senior year may be one of the last chances you get to do so.Don't get jaded.Yeah, you're a senior, and you've been working hard on things for a whopping three years, but this does not entitle you to be jaded. Being jaded at the age of 21 or 22 isn't sexy and will make for a terrible senior year. You do not have my permission to be jaded until you are at least 78. If Edie Windsor can keep fighting, so can you. Capeesh?Don't let your parents pressure you into anything.They're right sometimes, and their advice is fine and all, but if you had really listened to your parents, you probably wouldn't have come out as queer in the first place. As queer people we know in our bones that our parents aren't always right. You have to chart your future, and during senior year it is more important than ever to claim that.Don't sell out.Selling out can be a touchy subject during senior year. I define ""selling out"" in the following way: Selling out is taking a job that you know to be morally objectionable because it pays you a lot of money. So if a missile company asks you to come work for them, you should probably say no. It will feel weird to do this, and it is not easy to turn down an $80,000-a-year salary right out of college, but I think that history has proven over and over that money does not buy happiness. You owe it to yourself to do something with your life that makes the lives of others better.Don't live for the future.I think I wasted at least 25 percent of my senior year worrying about getting a job. That was just plain silly, and now that you're reading this, you are no longer allowed to make the same mistake. If you find yourself panicking about a job or graduate program, try taking a nap, going on a run, or going to a party instead. It will be a much better use of your time. If you waste your senior year stuck in the future, you'll never get that year back -- at least until we discover how to travel back in time. And when we do figure out how to travel back in time, I'm calling first dibs on the time machine.So that's it! If you follow these simple do's and don'ts, your senior year is destined to be amazing, and all your dreams will come true.With love and infinite wisdom, JacobThis piece was reposted from the Point Foundation Scholarship's Blog ""ViewPoint"".
