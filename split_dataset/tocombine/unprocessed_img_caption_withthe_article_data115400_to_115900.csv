(AP Photo/Matthew Brown, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cffc200000f90101d0e3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This article has appeared in the newspapers of my very conservative congressional district in Virginia.In medicine there's a saying, ""When you hear hoof beats, think of horses not zebras."" Whatever's going on is far more likely to be the usual than the extraordinary.But when it comes to climate change, the Republicans are telling Americans not to think horses, or even zebras. They're saying, think unicorns. Republicans want Americans to believe that the alarm about climate change is based on a scientific hoax.Republicans used to claim that the science was inconclusive. Fifteen years ago I was on television in Virginia debating the issue against a local Republican official who took the party-line of that era. But now, with so powerful a consensus among the experts -- 97 percent -- the Republicans have taken the fall-back position that climate science is a hoax.This hoax would have to be beyond extraordinary. Over the course of history, there have been hoaxes in science -- a scientist or two creating false evidence. But if any scientific hoax has involved more than two or three people, I have been unable to discover it. The scientific studies that show the disruption of the earth's climate due to human activities have been the work of thousands of scientists, from nations all over the world, conducted over decades. A scientific hoax of that magnitude is beyond improbable.If we ought not to believe in this unicorn, is there a horse around to explain the hoof beats?In fact, there is. We have an industry doing what other industries have done in similar situations. And we have a political party doing what it has done again and again.The 97 percent of climate scientists who agree that there's human-caused climate change also say that it would be irresponsible for civilized societies to fail to take action to avert -- or, by this time, simply to lessen -- the possible disasters ahead. Taking action, in this case, means weaning ourselves from our addiction to fossil fuels.It's not all that long since science discovered that another powerful industry's addictive products were having deadly results. That industry worked for decades to sow doubt where there was no good reason for doubt. Eventually, it was revealed that they had known the truth for years.I'm talking, of course, about the tobacco industry.But it's not just tobacco. Whenever industries have discovered that unfortunately their profits depended on sacrificing other people -- like for example, the asbestos and chemical industries -- they've done their best to hide or deny the truth. Are there any exceptions?For the energy companies to protect their profits by persuading millions of people to reject science would be nothing unusual. The stakes may be unprecedented, given the potential catastrophes we may be unleashing, but the choice of greed over caring for the greater good would fit a well-established pattern.It has been documented for well over a decade that climate change denial is largely funded by energy industries. Like the tobacco company executives all claiming that they did not believe nicotine was addictive or that their products were killing people, oil companies know better than what they tell the public. (I was told by two inside sources that by the time of the George W. Bush presidency, the oil companies were acknowledging behind closed doors that the scientists' warnings were correct, but were resolved to maintain their campaign to prevent the American public from knowing the truth.)Corporations protecting profits even at great cost to the greater good is no zebra or unicorn, but a common horse.   Then there's the relationship between the politicians and these huge energy corporations, among the richest and most powerful organizations in the world. The Republicans, especially, have a history of doing their bidding-- shouting ""Drill, Baby, Drill,"" protecting the subsidies we taxpayers still pay out to oil companies long after the original reason for them vanished along with $15-a-barrel oil. And now, most disturbingly, this campaign to discredit the urgent warnings from the scientists that there's big danger ahead and we'd better start steering our ship away from that iceberg.No surprise that the Republican Party -- no longer the Party of Teddy Roosevelt or even Richard Nixon when it comes to the environment-- would choose to protect not the stability of our climate but the interests of the corporations who are their political partners.  There's a choice. One can believe that we have a huge conspiracy to commit a scientific hoax -- bigger by many orders of magnitude than anything ever seen before. Or one can believe that we have powerful corporations and the political party that serves them following a well-established pattern of deception for the sake of profits.With the issue of climate change now front and center in our political arena, it's about time Americans approached it from a shared reality. It really shouldn't be that hard.Think horses."

That ad-campaign concept brief recently came over my email transom at Havas PR North America, where I'm CEO, and got me thinking. This isn't a post to plug my colleagues at Havas, or their client PayPal, for which they had created this concept. Although I'm proud of the brains at my sister agency, I'm sharing it because I think they homed in on a truth that's much bigger than one project, one client or one communications company. They identified and encapsulated a major trend that's behind many of the smaller trends I've been looking at, like über-empowered consumers and the end of gatekeeper culture:People are ruling the world. You can say that's always been the case--kings, presidents, CEOs, autocrats and despots are indeed all people. But these individuals have far less influence command than they did in the past. Now the power lies with the people, a collective noun that includes millions upon millions whose names we'll never even know. Three years ago a Tunisian fruit vendor set himself on fire and changed the course of history. In the Arab Spring that followed his act of defiance, we've seen democratic elections in places once ruled by potentates. People are taking to the streets to protest Middle Eastern strongmen, Brazilian bus fares and more. And it's not just the developing world, historically home to millions of the oppressed and voiceless. Consider the effects of the resolutely populist Occupy Wall Street protests and Tea Party on American politics. And speaking of unabashed populism, the new mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, made it a campaign platform, promising to raise taxes on the city's elites in order to fund universal pre-kindergarten and to himself be the antidote of 12 years of being governed by the powerfully patrician Michael Bloomberg. (Full disclosure: I am a big fan of former Mayor Bloomberg and not very optimistic about Mayor de Blasio, but the people spoke and so it goes.)The new pope, Francis, who assumed the role more than a year ago, is known for his populism as well, softening some of Catholicism's autocratic strictures and even connecting with the faithful through Twitter. His policies and practices are shaking the very foundations of the Vatican. Twitter, of course, is one of the new tools that have made this radical populism finally possible. Everyday people are now ruling the world because finally we all have a voice. You don't need to have money, you don't need to have a prestigious job, you don't need to have family connections. You just need a (free) Twitter handle and you can make yourself heard. Not only can Everyday Joe (or José or Giuseppe or Jozef) get his own customer service needs taken care of; he can also broadcast his opinions in a way that can have a real effect on a company's business and bottom line. People are more empowered now than they've ever been. And they're having their say in ways they've never had before, heard by wider audiences and taken ever more seriously. They're demanding a world that works for people, not the other way around. They're creating a world that puts people, not institutions, first. They're building a future that includes more of the things they want and less of what they don't. This unstoppable trend has been fueled by technology, and mobile is the driving force. We all now have in our pockets the tools to--well, if not change the world--at least make institutions pay attention and change their ways. President Obama's strong digital strategy is one of the things that led to his presidential victory in 2008. Social media put the images of the Arab Spring in front of the world and served as a practical tool for protest organizers to connect with their constituents in places that were otherwise hobbled by censorship. But now social media is just the beginning. The sharing economy and the technological tools that have grown out of it drives this revolution. Anyone can be a company. Crafty types can sell their wares on Etsy. Everyday homeowners can become profitable hotels with Airbnb, Onefinestay, VRBO and others. (I have become an annoying advocate of monetizing every asset we have, and thus you can find my second house--make that my beloved small biz--on Airbnb and Homeaway, for now. My long-suffering life partner, Jim, has killed my idea of taking in nightly guests at house No. 1, but I think he's wrong and every bed counts.) Regular drivers can become entrepreneurial taxis with Uber and Lyft. And we can leave major financial institutions out of the equation, paying one another more directly with services like PayPal, Square and, in the developing world, M-Pesa and other mobile-banking technologies. And if bitcoin succeeds, it will be the ultimate populist currency. The fact that everyday people are in charge like never before is thrilling. As a trend, it's fascinating. The course is still being charted: It's messy, imperfect and sometimes chaotic, but there's no turning back. The people have gotten a big taste of being in control. And who would sacrifice that?"

She won federal approval in April for the long-delayed veterans study, when the Department of Health and Human Services signed off on the project. Ricardo Pereyda, an Iraq war veteran with PTSD who said he's been treating his symptoms with marijuana since 2010, started the Change.org petition to reinstate Sisley, which had nearly 28,000 signatures Tuesday night.""The university must reinstate Dr. Sisley, providing her with the necessary space and resources she needs to conduct her research,"" Pereyda wrote in the petition. ""Her study could mean life or death for many veterans. 'Bigger Questions, Better Answers, Bear Down,' is the Wildcat motto. Demand that President Hart and the University of Arizona live up to it.""In an interview with the news site Vice this week, Sisley said political pressure from Arizona lawmakers cost her the job.""I am a lifelong Republican, and I am very conservative,"" Sisley told Vice. ""This is going to make me sound like a liberal but I’ll say it: members of the right-wing legislature in Arizona have never accepted the fact that the voters approved medical marijuana in Arizona in 2010. They’re furious and they’ve made attempts year after year to repeal the medical marijuana law, but they can’t.""The University of Arizona said it doesn't comment on personnel issues, but denied that her firing had anything to do with her research. The university released a statement to CNN, saying that ""in 2013, the UA championed state legislation to ensure that universities could perform medical marijuana research on campus. The UA has not received political pressure to terminate any employee.""Sisley said she's skeptical of that position. “The University of Arizona can say whatever they want about their love of pot research but the proof is in their inaction, not their words,"" Sisley told The Daily Beast.Sisley blamed the loss of her job on Arizona politicians, including state Sen. Kimberley Yee, who blocked funds for the state medical marijuana program that would have studied medicinal use of cannabis for PTSD. Yee wanted the funds directed to drug-prevention education. Sisley also accused state Senate President Andy Biggs (R), of trying to thwart her marijuana research. The Department of Veterans Affairs said in a 2012 report that nearly 30 percent of veterans who served in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars suffer from PTSD. Scientists have speculated that marijuana could help veterans suffering from PTSD symptoms, including anxiety, flashbacks and depression. An estimated 7.7 million adult Americans live with the condition.While 23 states have legalized marijuana for medical use, fewer than a dozen of them allow doctors to recommend medical marijuana for PTSD-related symptoms. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, which classifies cannabis as one of the ""most dangerous"" substances with ""no currently accepted medical use.""Sisley's study aimed to examine the effects of five different potencies of smoked or vaporized cannabis on 50 veterans who have PTSD.""My sole focus over the last four years is how do we help our vets who are coming back in droves with PTSD that is treatment-resistant -- how do we help these folks?"" Sisley told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta in an interview Monday. ""No one is saying [marijuana] is a cure, but it does seem to be effective for symptom control and the notion that there's a potential that a plant could reduce the human suffering of these vets and yet it's being forced to sit on a shelf and not be tested rigorously is an abomination."""
8,ARTS,Sex Lessons from the Old Masters (NSFW),"F. Scott Hess, ContributorArtist & Associate Professor, Laguna College of Art + Design, ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-lessons-from-the-old-_b_5592688.html,"With the debut of the cable series Masters of Sex, any purely art historical Google search for risque old master paintings is now totally skewed to the Showtime television program.",2014-07-16,2014-07-16-1PoussinJupiterandAntiopeorVenusandSatyr2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-16-1PoussinJupiterandAntiopeorVenusandSatyr2-thumb.jpg," NICOLAS POUSSIN, Jupiter & Antiope, oil on canvas.With the debut of the cable series Masters of Sex, any purely art historical Google search for risque old master paintings is now totally skewed to the Showtime television program. In an attempt to reposition the discussion to its former elevated status, I will here discuss the compositions of a few paintings wherein great artists of the past buried sexual content deep in the fundament of their works. JEAN HONRE FRAGONARD, The Bolt, 1778, oil on canvas, Louvre, Paris.An obvious place to start is Fragonard's The Bolt, a seemingly simple scene of seduction. The lovers' gestures are urgent and dramatic, and aim diagonally towards the bolt of the title. Strong light focuses our attention on their actions. The bolt is a knowing visual pun of the activity about to commence. Her body language is a study in psychological conflict; ""No! I mean yes! No!"" The bed compositionally balances the figures, a third character in the story. Sitting back in the shadow to the left of the painting it doesn't grab our attention as the brightly lit characters do, but its meaning becomes more obvious the more it is studied. The inviting, soft, vaginal folds glow a passionate red, waiting to swallow the sexual combatants whole. Hidden by Fragonard in the silks and the folds of the sheets and pillows are the forms of a woman being ravaged, her breasts and her sex thrown open. The single fruit on a foreground table is a second visual pun, purposely placed as an ersatz testicle. MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI, The Sin of Adam & Eve, 1508-12, fresco, Sistine Chapel ceiling, The Vatican.Michelangelo hid sex in plain sight sixty-five feet above the Pope, in the Holy Father's own house. The old masters were adept at inserting the religiously forbidden but most natural and basic of human acts into depictions of holy scripture. On the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel Michelangelo depicted Eve momentarily interrupted in the first ever apple-bobbing contest as the female serpent hands her a fig. Original sin indeed, viewed enthusiastically by five million oblivious Vatican visitors annually. CARAVAGGIO, The Incredulity of St. Thomas, 1603, oil on canvas. Sanssouci Palace, Potsdam.What can you say about a group of men watching the insertion of a digit into a wound that never heals? Caravaggio was a clever but crude fellow who could wield a brush like an angel sings. Do you really think this painting street brawler didn't know what his content was up to when he left four guys in bathrobes alone in his dark studio? C'mon, this is the same artist who early on painted a supremely lascivious John the Baptist embracing a horned sheep, and a grinning pre-pubescent Cupid proudly flashing the viewer amid the discarded cultural attributes of Western civilization. CARAVAGGIO, John the Baptist, 1602, oil on canvas, Musei Capitolini, Rome. CARAVAGGIO, Amor Victorious, 1602, oil on canvas, Gemaeldegalerie, Berlin.Leonardo Da Vinci's painting of the angel Gabriel announcing the impregnation of the Virgin Mary by God is perhaps the greatest abstract presentation of divine sex ever created. If there is one image that perfectly demonstrates to my students what is meant by abstract psychological elements in a composition, it is Da Vinci's Annunciation.  LEONARDO DA VINCI, The Annunciation, 1472, oil & tempera on panel, Uffizi Gallery, Florence.There are hundreds of Annunciation paintings in Christian art, and they often have the Virgin in a house, commonly seen as a symbol of a woman's space. An angel then 'announces' her pregnancy through an open door, or a shaft of light from God strikes the reluctant Mary. Da Vinci has the Virgin tucked within a series of verticals that form the building, while the angel is aligned with the long horizontal of a low wall. His gesture is angled forcefully forward, while hers is one of surprised receptivity. The formal elements tell the story. This Annunciation is a monumental depiction of sex on God's level, horizontal meets vertical, penis and vagina reduced to their purest abstract forms. Da Vinci's genius lies in the utter simplicity of his bold design.The head of the god-sized phallus is formed by the bookstand and the top of the desk, and aims directly at Mary's womb. It is interesting to note that the desk placed before Mary functions, in an abstract sense, as a sign of her virginity, her hymen. Try removing it and she appears exposed and much more available. The bas-relief symbols on the side of the desk hint at female reproductive anatomy, purity, and fecundity. PETER PAUL RUBENS, The Rape of the Daughters of Leucippus, 1617, oil on canvas, Alte Pinakothek, Munich.  Rubens depicts Castor and Pollux abducting (read raping) the daughters of King Leucippus, whom they will later graciously marry. As a young art student in Vienna, I was mesmerized by the space between the two women's bodies. It was an area of great tension, more than could be accounted for by the active outline of their bodies. Rubens framed the action in an invisible circle roughly filling the canvas. Two hidden circles of the same size, one descending from the upper left, the other rising from the lower right, collide like giant wheels grinding against one another. This grinding effect is achieved through the flow in direction of the women's bodies. The tension this creates presents an underlying compositional metaphor for the rape, but Rubens cancels some of its effectiveness by characterizing the men as solicitous, and one of the women in ecstasy. Perhaps this was in deference to their future marriage, or a nod to the mores of the day, but to modern eyes the disconnect between the act and the characters' motives is stark. FRANS HALS, Shrovetide Revelers, 1615, oil on canvas, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.  In this piece Dutch master Frans Hals paints carnival celebrants before Lent. Carnival, or Shrovetide, is a festival sanctioned by the church and society that precedes a period of fasting and penitence. It is a time for the masses to blow off steam, to mock the authorities that rule their lives on all the other days of the year. This is achieved by dressing up as holy men, nobles, or in the clothing of the opposite sex. Comedic scenes are acted out, great quantities of alcohol and rich foods are consumed, and the people generally behave in a fashion that would embarrass them in their everyday lives. Hals depicts these revelers at a table loaded with party food and hearty ale. A red-faced drunken 'nobleman' wears a sash of sausages, a young 'lass' who appears male flirts with a man to the right making obscene gestures with his hands. The trusty triangle is employed here in a subversive manner. The religious figure that in Christian art commonly commands the center of a triangle is replaced here with a cross-dressing non-virgin whose very gesture recalls a benediction. Hals cleverly turns the propaganda of the church on its head. With this witty invention the underlying form of his composition follows the purpose of carnival perfectly.The old masters were Masters of Sex centuries before the television series' producers were conceived. Their tricks of the trade still have the ability to shock us, juxtaposing as they do human desires that remain religiously and societally forbidden, with the sudden joy of discovering that source of our greatest pleasure surreptitiously placed before unsuspecting eyes. Art history sizzles!"

Still, they're theologically conservative.""Woelki is a Cologne native and served there for years under his retired predecessor, the staunchly conservative Cardinal Joachim Meisner, before becoming bishop of Berlin in 2011.When his Berlin appointment was announced, some politicians and Catholics in Berlin said he was too conservative for a city with such a large gay community, pointing to comments he had made that homosexuality was against “the order of creation”.They also noted that he did his doctorate in theology at a pontifical university in Rome run by the conservative Catholic movement Opus Dei.But Woekli surprised Berliners by saying he respected all people and would gladly meet with gay activists.A year later, in 2012, he said: ""If two homosexuals take responsibility for each other, if they are loyal to each other over the long term, then one should see this in the same way as heterosexual relations.""Berlin's Alliance against Homophobia nominated him for its Respect Prize that year, an honour he politely declined by saying it was normal for a Christian to respect all people so he should not receive an award for it.In July 2013, the newly elected Pope Francis changed the tone of Vatican comments on homosexuality in comments on the plane returning from a visit to Brazil, saying, ""If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge him?""The German Catholic Church is one of the richest in the world and helps fund Vatican activities as well as missionary work in poor countries.Its financial strength and long history of theologians and leading Church personalities, including the now retired Pope Benedict, give it considerable influence in the Vatican.Cardinal Reinhard Marx, head of Germany's other powerful archdiocese, Munich, is a member of the pope's group of cardinals working out proposed reforms for the worldwide Church."

Cheney said Monday that national defense ""ought to be our top priority for spending. Not food stamps, not highways or anything else.""Biden rejected his predecessor's absolutism in remarks at the annual gathering of Generation Progress, a youth-focused organization associated with the Center for American Progress.""I don't take a back seat to anyone, including Vice President Cheney, on the issue of our military,"" Biden said, adding that he does not subscribe to the idea that ""it's somehow inherently more important to spend the money on the military than on domestic needs."" He said he saw a ""sacred obligation"" to take care of those who came home from war, and that he knew what it was like to have a son stationed in Iraq.Biden spoke -- sometimes at a blistering pace -- about many of the issues that progressives have put at the center of their electoral efforts. On topics from immigration reform to voting rights, he rallied a crowd of young progressives who were spending a day in trainings with and hearing speeches from top Democratic leaders.Recounting his work as a senator from Delaware to ensure voting rights, Biden seemed befuddled that the issue was still controversial today.""I never ever thought I'd be standing here as a grown man, in a battle still, for access to the ballot box in the year 2014,"" he said.But Biden became most animated when talking about the issue of campus sexual assault and his efforts to end violence against women.""I'm committed to ensuring that our country adopts a no-tolerance policy on violence against women,"" Biden said to applause, his voice rising. ""Your generation has the ability to make it clear that anyone who engages in this behavior is a pariah.""Biden has long pursued prevention of domestic violence as a signature cause, introducing the Violence Against Women Act as a senator in 1990.His speech on Wednesday turned personal at times. Speaking softly, he told the story of his first wife and daughter, who died in a car accident as he was first preparing to take his place in the Senate. He said older members of the Senate taught him lessons during that period about valuing consensus over polarization, and his audience needed to take those lessons to heart.Biden, a possible 2016 presidential candidate, will also address progressives Thursday at Netroots Nation in Detroit."

Mario Goetze volleyed in the winning goal in extra time to give Germany its fourth World Cup title with a 1-0 victory over Argentina. (AP Photo/Adriana Lorete-Agencia o Globo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13a5f240000360076e223.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Brazil's crushing World Cup loss to Germany's world champion team wasn't just bad news for Brazilian football fans. It's also likely to reignite the anger that many Brazilians felt towards the government of President Dilma Rousseff for hosting such a spectacular event when it could hardly afford decent public transport and social services for its citizens.Corruption is also part of the explosive narrative. In the most expensive World Cup ever, millions of Brazilian taxpayer dollars went into corruption-plagued construction projects, including a new bridge in Belo Horizonte--site of the humiliating dismantling of Brazil by Germany--which has already collapsed.With Brazil stuck with a $14-billion price tag and FIFA--probably the most corrupt international sports body in the world--clearing a $2-billion, tax-free profit, it is hard to see how Rousseff's center-left government can survive the coming blowback.In many ways, the episode encapsulates the complex relationship between the politics of progressivism and corruption in the developing world.Corruption as Unifying IssueApart from passionate support for their national sports teams, hatred of government corruption and ""crony capitalism"" is one of the few issues that unite all social groups in developing countries.Corruption is often the main issue of opposition parties seeking to get into elected office in democracies. And along with anger at dictatorial abuse, disgust with corruption has been one of the driving forces in the toppling of authoritarian regimes, which was particularly evident during the Arab Spring.An alliance between civil society and reformist groups in government can be a powerful force in curbing corruption.For instance, during the last few months in the Philippines, it played a central role in the historic abolition of the so-called ""pork barrel,"" or lump-sum government funds given by the executive to members of the legislative branch, which has long been a source of presidential control over members of Congress. The reformist thrust of the anti-pork barrel campaign has not yet been spent, resulting recently in a Supreme Court ruling against the executive's abuse of budgetary powers and the high-profile prosecution of several senators for embezzling funds intended for public projects.Probably even more exemplary than the Philippines in fighting corruption is Indonesia, where prosecutions of corrupt officials by the Corruption Eradication Commission have achieved a 100-percent conviction rate, sending even high-profile politicians to jail for their misdeeds. As one account notes, the commission has enjoyed widespread popular support on account of its ""ability to prosecute those at the top of the food chain,"" which has insulated it against reprisals from resentful elites.A Double-Edged SwordReducing corruption can undoubtedly contribute to reducing inequality, both directly and indirectly. Nevertheless, campaigning against corruption is not usually high on the agenda of progressive groups.For instance, for the Brazilian Workers' Party that President Lula da Silva led to power in 2002, corruption was an issue, but it was subordinate to changing Brazil's highly unequal social structure. But once Lula came to power, dealing with corruption became a central concern, especially when people close to the popular progressive president were discovered bribing parliamentarians to get support for government-initiated legislation.For many progressives, the corruption issue is a double-edged sword. Multilateral agencies like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have promoted the view that ""good governance"" is the central problem in development, by which they often mean that government intervention in the economy creates opportunities for corruption. This view is particularly popular among the middle classes, whose discourse dominates public discussion.In other words, the anti-corruption cause is often tied to an ideological neoliberal agenda.Elite politicians frequently jump on the anti-corruption bandwagon because it allows them to paint themselves as saints and their foes as devils even as they marginalize the urgency for structural changes like agrarian reform and income redistribution. In the Philippines, for instance, the Aquino government has prided itself on its ""Straight Path"" anti-corruption program. But despite its best efforts, its progressive coalition partner, the Citizens' Action Party, has not been able to make advancing agrarian reform or rolling back neoliberal policies priorities for the administration.From Anti-Corruption to Anti-DemocracyFor progressives, the greatest risk of the anti-corruption discourse is the way it can be manipulated by elites to derail efforts at progressive transformation.The most recent case of this is in Thailand, where conservative royalist elites were able to mobilize the Bangkok middle class on an anti-corruption platform to provoke a military coup, which felled the elected populist government formerly headed by Yingluck Shinawatra. An earlier putsch in 2006 overthrew Yingluck's brother Thaksin, who is enormously popular with the rural lower classes.Charges of corruption against Thaksin were not fabricated--there is no doubt that he bought many of his political alliances with elite politicians. But the main reason he was able to cultivate such massive popularity among the rural and urban poor of Thailand was because of his transformative policies. He freed the country of the enormously harmful policy straitjacket imposed by the International Monetary Fund following the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and promoted programs that directly addressed the needs of marginalized Thais.The most important of these were a universal healthcare program that gave people medical treatment for all diseases for the equivalent of 35 baht (slightly over a dollar at today's exchange rate), the so-called ""One Million Baht per Village Fund"" that went to localities to invest in productive activities of their choice, and a moratorium on the debt of farmers. The Thai political and intellectual elites, resorting to anti-corruption discourse, defined these programs for the middle class mind as forms of vote buying.The real issue, however, was the empowerment of the poor that Thaksin's programs brought about, which led to the creation of a massive electoral majority which, in the eyes of the elite and the middle class, threatened a fundamental and permanent redistribution of political and economic power. With this perspective, it is not surprising that the struggle against corruption was turned into a struggle against democracy.The slogan ""reform before elections"" that mobilized academics, professionals, white-collar workers, and small businesspeople was essentially a call to devise constitutional arrangements that would keep electoral majorities based on the rural and urban poor from forming governments. The military junta is heeding this call, imperiling the cornerstone of democracy: majority rule.Perhaps the best illustration of the transmogrification of anti-corruption discourse was this assertion from a supposedly liberal Thai academic, who told me: ""For me democracy is not the best regime. I'm in this sense an elitist. If there are people who are more capable, why not give them more weight? Why should they not come ahead of everybody else? You may call me a Nietzschean.""Lessons for ProgressivesSo how should progressives relate to corruption?First of all they should recognize that corruption is a universal concern, and its elimination or mitigation can have a positive impact on reducing inequality. This is especially true in the case of the extravagant infrastructure expenditures and massive evictions of poor Brazilians that paved the way for the World Cup.Yet they should be careful not to play into the hands of neoliberal elites looking to reverse the redistribution of power and wealth away from the poor and marginalized classes. The movement against corruption can be channeled into a mobilization of the middle class to oust governments that promote popular political and economic empowerment, as in Thailand.So even as they embrace fighting corruption as part of a broader movement for social transformation, progressives would be well advised not to get trapped into using anti-corruption rhetoric for anti-democratic ends."

Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). Lewis decided to try his luck at two of Brown's campaign stops in New Hampshire, but quickly learned that Brown was in no mood to talk to the press.""Just a few miles from a town named Freedom ... I was expelled from two consecutive Brown campaign events, banned from asking him questions and, when I declined to abide by those terms, questioned by an officer of the law,"" Lewis wrote.Lewis first showed up at a diner where Brown had stopped as part of a statewide tour. He introduced himself to Brown and asked if he could pose some questions. Brown asked what the questions would be about, but retreated for the bathroom when Lewis mentioned the Hobby Lobby case.Lewis learned of a second campaign stop Brown would be making hours later at Hobbs Tavern and Brewing Company in West Ossipee, and decided to show up there, too. A staffer told Lewis he could observe the event but would not be permitted to ask questions. Lewis said he did not agree to those terms and was promptly kicked out. Several minutes later, a police officer showed up to question him, Lewis wrote:None of the parties disputed the facts of the case. I was the journalist. My job was to ask questions. The man holed up inside the tavern was Scott Brown, a would-be senator who didn’t want to answer. I was eventually asked to leave. I left.Rob Finneron, the owner of Hobbs Tavern and Brewing Company, told The Huffington Post he called the police after Lewis refused to leave despite being told the event was private.""Mr. Brown was having a private gathering in my establishment. The reporter wouldn't let anyone else really get a chance to talk and because he wasn't an invited guest, I asked him to leave,"" Finneron said. Finneron added that Lewis was warned the police would be called if he did not leave. Lewis was ""argumentative and indignant"" and proceeded to interrupt a conversation Brown was having with someone else, Finneron said. The reporter did not leave until he saw that Finneron was, in fact, on the phone with police.Finneron agreed that when the police officer arrived, he did not find an issue. Gennady Kolker, a spokesman for The Guardian, disputed claims that Lewis acted improperly.""Paul Lewis was engaged in legitimate and responsible reporting on an important issue from a candidate seeking public office,"" Gennady said in a statement to HuffPost. ""The suggestion that he acted inappropriately is inaccurate.""The Hobby Lobby ruling, stating that for-profit, closely held corporations do not have to cover contraception in their health plans if they morally object to it, is a complicated issue for Brown, who has been cast as anti-women by Shaheen. Brown's campaign has insisted that he supports women's health care and their access to contraception, while stating that Obamacare ""threatens"" people's freedoms.An NBC/Marist poll released Wednesday found Shaheen leading Brown, 50 percent to 42 percent, with just 6 percent of respondents undecided. Other surveys have also found Shaheen comfortably ahead.This story has been updated to include comment from The Guardian."
