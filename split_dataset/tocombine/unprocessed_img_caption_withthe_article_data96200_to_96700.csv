Walking through the Albuquerque airport on the day of the Summit, I was surprised to see a TV headline ask the question, ""Is ISIS a religious group?"" It is an absurd question, and one that, despite his comments at the Summit, President Obama cannot be taking seriously.Of course it is a religious group. ISIS adherents are very clear that their motivations are grounded in faith, and their actions are directly tied to religious scripture. Week after week, they publish the specific Koranic justification for their most gruesome acts, whether it is the beheading of apostates and Christians, throwing gay people off of high buildings, stoning to death women accused of adultery, or the enslaving of women and children. One cannot read the article ""The Revival of Slavery"" in the ISIS magazine Dabiq, with its debate over how Shari'ah law dictates the appropriate punishment of Yazidi women -- enslavement as pagans or execution as apostates -- and not see its fundamentalist zeal.ISIS is the very definition of a fundamentalist religious group. Religious fundamentalism is nothing new in the modern era, and not unique to Islam. Christians and Jews, to say nothing of Hindus, each have their groups that seek to live in accordance with laws and scripture that date back thousands of years. Each has had their zealots who have committed terrible crimes. Each embraces practices that many view to be medieval. Christianity has a strong millennialist tradition, mirrored or even rooted in Judaism, that suggests that a return to the fundamentals of faith will presage the end of days and the second coming, a stance that is widely embraced in Iran, notably by former President Ahmadinejad. ISIS is not unique in its fundamentalism or its apocalyptic vision, but rather in its dictates to conquest that the Prophet -- himself a general -- set forth in his foundational work.The White House and President Obama continued to bend over backward this week at a White House summit on combating violent extremism to avoid language that might suggest the broader Islamic world is culpable for the conduct of its most violent and fundamentalist adherents. ""No religion is responsible for terrorism,"" the President declared. ""We are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam."" Yet his first statement and his last are not credible. Few would argue that religion over the millennia has been the rationale for countless episodes of terrorism, and all major religions have their own history of war and violence that we would now would label as terrorist. The President's comment that ""No religion is responsible for terrorism. People are responsible for violence and terrorism"" echoes the old NRA trope Guns don't kill people, people kill people, and, while true, ignores the role of religion and faith as defining human motivations. The sectarian nature of religious faith revolves around each community's search for truth, often complicated by a fervent commitment to their own interpretations of ancient scripture. Thus, one community's essential truth might inevitably be viewed as another community's ""perversion.""ISIS is not a group that has perverted Islam, as the President would have us believe, but rather has interpreted and embraced it with its own fundamentalist ardor. Like Protestantism and Judaism, Sunni Islam does not have an ecclesiastic structure that can discipline the extremists in its midst. While the Grand Muftis of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, viewed as seminal religious authorities in the Sunni and Wahhabi Sunni traditions, respectively, have each condemned ISIS, there in fact is no central religious authority, no Pope with the authority to tell ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi where he is wrong and how he must align his interpretation of the words of the Prophet to conform to the larger Sunni world. Indeed, like al Qaeda before it, ISIS's appeal to young Muslims is in part rooted in its defiance of the leaders of the established order.It is notable that when Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei admonished ISIS for the beheading of Egyptian Coptic Christians, he did not suggest that they were wrong in their reading of the Koran, but rather essentially said that you just can't do that anymore. Perhaps unwittingly, Ali Khamenei was making the case for modernism. He set aside an ecclesiastic debate about the literal words of the Koran in favor of the mores of the modern world. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was more explicit last month when he made a televised appeal to Sunnis and Shi'a alike that ISIS puritanical utopianism posed the biggest threat to Islam in history and called on the entire Muslim world to ""work to isolate them, surround them and end it.""Despite something close to a consensus about the threat posed by ISIS, several of the countries most directly threatened remain consumed by their own politics and rivalries. Turkey, a NATO member state that has military capabilities that dwarf ISIS, should be playing a leading and decisive role in the fight against ISIS. ISIS rhetoric has increasingly focused on attacking the armies of ""Rome."" While this has raised alarm flags in Italy, particularly with ISIS forces in Libya poised directly to the south of Italy, Graeme Wood has made the argument in his recent piece in the The Atlantic that Rome in Islamic prophecy is a reference to the Turkish capital Constantinople (today's Istanbul), the former seat of the Holy Roman Empire and the state that destroyed the last caliphate. Thus, while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan continues to regard ISIS as an instrument in his feud with Syria's Bashir al-Assad -- a man Erdoğan long supported until Assad insulted him -- Wood suggests that Turkey itself, along with Saudi Arabia, may well be ISIS's ultimate target. For their part, the Sunni Saudis and their Gulf state partners continue to view Shi'a Iran as their greater sectarian and regional threat and are loath to participate in any anti-ISIS coalition that includes cooperation with the apostate Shi'a.It is against this backdrop of regional rivalries and hostility that President Obama is working to build a coalition against a common enemy. While the fight against ISIS clearly should be led by the Muslim nations that stand immediately in harm's way -- Turkey, Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia -- those nations appear incapable of developing and executing a coordinated military response on the ground. With the American public steadfast against a new ground war in the Middle East, the President is left to struggle to bring together a coalition of Turks, Arabs and Persians, Sunni and Shi'a, that by and large dislike and distrust each other as much as they might fear ISIS.Like President Bush before him, President Obama has sought to moderate the language used by the United States to describe ISIS and the threat of radical Islamists in deference to the Muslim partners in the erstwhile anti-ISIS coalition. Each of those partners is sensitive to any language that might suggest that they are siding with America in a war between the Islam and the West. Under similar circumstances, the Bush administration settled on the term Global War on Terror, eschewing direct references to Islamic terrorism or the term preferred early on, Islamofascism.It is not difficult to understand the strategic importance of the language used by our leaders to America's ability to build and sustain a coalition with Muslim partners. Perhaps the American public might be puzzled by the President's strained parsing of language and his reluctance to call Islamic terrorism by its name, but members of Congress (or former mayors of New York City) have no such excuse. They understand full well what is at stake and the reasoning behind the Presidents use of words.In the early days of the Cold War, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Arthur Vandenberg articulated an ethos, adhered to in Washington, D.C. for decades, that partisan politics must stop at the water's edge. This meant that American politicians of all parties should stand together on matters of foreign policy, whatever their political disagreements at home, so that they would not by their partisan actions and words weaken the nation in the eyes of the world. Today, of course, our partisanship knows no limits and few hesitated to attack and ridicule the President this week. Even in a case like the fight against ISIS, a complex and troubling challenge for which few, if any, of the President's adversaries have any significant alternative strategies to offer, any notion that political adversaries might stand together for the larger interest of the nation has long been rendered quaint."

I hate when people say ""empty-nesters."" It sounds sad. And old.My daughter moved out. I got a promotion. We moved from the Midwest United States to England. To say 2011 was a year of change ... well, that's a pretty big understatement.I looked forward to a quiet house, spur-of-the-moment weekends away, sex with the door open ... and all of that stuff was nice, don't get me wrong. It was like being newlyweds again. But, I felt a void. I think my husband chalked it up to lack of having someone to ""do for,"" to fuss over. Maybe that was a little true but I felt inexplicably directionless. My days were full and my life was busy, happy even. But something was missing.We'd discussed adoption when we first got married. We were older. My fertility ship had sailed into the sunset. We talked about how nice it would be to parent together in vague terms. These adoption conversations never really went anywhere.I've always felt a pull toward adoption. My brother is adopted, as are several of my cousins. I looked into adoption as a single woman, before I met my husband but it was beyond my budget and, given what was going on in my life, probably beyond the scope of what I'd have been able to handle. Sometimes, the universe gets things right.Shortly after we moved to England, I met another American, a woman named Jenny. She had a lovely Chinese-born daughter and the first time I saw them together, I had kind of an ""aha"" moment. I know that doesn't make sense and as much as I've tried to rationalize it and articulate it over the years, I really just can't. I can only say that when I saw Jenny and her daughter together, the path I was supposed to be on became a little clearer.Jenny was kind enough to point me in the right direction as far as adoption agencies and paperwork went. The logistics of wading through the unholy amount of paperwork that is international adoption were a lot easier to digest because of her handholding and never-ending patience with my many, many questions.To begin the parenting journey again at 45 and 49 was quite another matter. The paperwork was tedious and the waiting was agony but none of that compares to actually adjusting to having a new child in your family, when you're a couple that's a little set in their ways.Our son Zack was 26 months old when he was placed in our arms for the first time and we were immediately thrust into a world of poop, snot, and loud toys. It turned our life upside down ... in a good way. In a crazy tired good way. Our second son, Kyle, joined our family a year later. Today, we have two 4-year-old virtual twins. Our boys are four months apart. Life is good. Life is freakin' loud.Becoming parents again at midlife has been interesting. We joke that it will either keep us young or drive us into an early grave. I use a lot more hair color and get a lot less sleep. But, I smile more and worry less about what other people think about how we live. We get a lot of ""wow, how great it is you've adopted"" with the unspoken ""at your age."" I've even been asked if I was the grandma, which wasn't one of my top ten life moments, but I made it through.I'm not suggesting every empty nester's answer to feeling a little directionless is to go out and have another kid, but for us ... it's working. My back creaks and squeaks when I bend over to give the boys a bath. When one of my boys informs me (and when I say informs me, I mean yells in my ear at close range) that it's ""no more dark"" at the butt-crack of dawn, I realize exactly how old I am, down to the month.There are all kinds of reason to adopt: not being able to have babies the old-fashioned way, wanting to ""save"" a child or just liking the idea of expanding your family with a child who needs one.I wake up sometimes (usually at 3 a.m. because there's a little foot in my kidney) and marvel at the direction my life has taken. No, I didn't expect this life in my almost fifties. But, I figure I've bought myself another 10 years or so of driving carpools, attending soccer practices and fielding ""but whys"" and defending ""because I said so's.""Maybe not the traditional path, but it's the path I chose. It's my path. It's my story. The rest has yet to be written.This originally appeared on Jill's blog Ripped Jeans and Bifocals. Hang out with Jill on Facebook and Twitter.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"
3,SCIENCE,How The Brain Travels Back In Time,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brain-mental-time-travel-_n_6714550.html,,2015-02-21,Summery pictures hanging from washing line using clothespins.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e690e962600001123b62991.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In one important way, we are capable of traveling back in time. Through memory, we can return to childhood, go back to the moment we first fell in love or recall our first professional triumph. Vivid memories that call to mind an experience in deep sensory detail can seem to transport us back to another time and place. When we recall the particular bit of information we're looking for, we also recall many other surrounding details -- how we felt, what we were wearing, what came before and afterwards. New research from neuroscientists at Vanderbilt University sheds light on how the brain performs this remarkable function. The researchers analyzed brain activity of individuals performing a memory recollection task in order to show what's going on when we come up with elaborate memories that feel so real that they take us back to a time in the past. They were able to use brain activity patterns to predict the order in which study participants recalled information that they had previously received. “It’s extremely important that we understand what different brain regions are doing as we search through our memories,” psychologist Dr. Sean Polyn, the study's lead author, said in a statement. “Diseases like Alzheimer’s and epilepsy are devastating to memory, and this information can help us develop treatments to preserve patients’ memories and identify adverse effects that new psychotropic drugs may have on people’s memory.”The Vanderbilt research team sought to determine how memories are encoded with different levels of vividness and detail. They investigated both ""high fidelity memories"" -- those that are very well-preserved in our minds, even years later -- as well as bits of information that are remembered, but in isolation, without surrounding details and sensory information.""In everyday life, when you have an experience, your brain constructs this rich neural code representing the details of that experience. Later, if you think back to that experience, the brain attempts to reactivate that neural representation,"" Polyn explained in an email to The Huffington Post. ""Mental time travel is when the brain does a really good job reactivating that past state, which can feel like you are actually revisiting the experience, in your mind’s eye. According to Polyn, if a person studies a list of items, and then searches their memory to try to report back those items in order, they'll often report a cluster of things that happened right around the moment of remembering that item, suggesting that their brain has mentally travelled back to that moment. A brain region called the medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been known to play a role in memory, largely because amnesia often results when this region is damaged. The researchers devised a model to show how structures within the MTL support the retrieval of memories. Finding that the anterior region of the MTL signals when the memory is being retrieved, but doesn't suggest how detailed the memory is. However, they found that the posterior region becomes active when a highly detailed memory is being recalled.""We find that activity in the posterior medial temporal lobe allows us to predict when the person is going to have a ‘mental time travel moment,’ we can tell when they are about to report a cluster of memories for things that happened nearby in time,"" Polyn said. To test the model, fMRI scans were conducted on 20 participants between the ages of 18 and 35, while they were given a list of 24 names of common objects like 'horse' and 'boat.' After briefly concentrating on the words and then pausing, they were asked to recall the words they had just studied in the order the occurred. The researchers found that when the participant's brain activity revealed that they had retrieved a memory with ""high fidelity,"" their next response was likely to be the next item on the list -- suggesting that they also recalled the detail around the object. But when they did not recall the item with high fidelity, the next item was often not the next one on the list, which suggests that the information was recalled in isolation. “This demonstrates that the brain stamps memories with a temporal code,"" Polyn said in the statement. ""These time-travel recollections allow the brain to retrieve that temporal code, which makes memories for nearby things more accessible, in this case the next item in the list.”Understanding what's happening in different brain regions when we're searching for memories may have some important implications for the study of memory-related disorders like Alzheimer's. ""People with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, often have difficulty remembering things that just happened to them,"" Polyn told HuffPost. ""A doctor could have a patient repeat back a series of numbers a few times, but then a few minutes later, the patient might not even remember that they even studied those things. If we can understand what different brain regions are doing during healthy memory retrieval, that can give us great insight into what’s going wrong when memory is damaged. It may also help us develop better tests for early detection of memory disorders, and give us ideas for how to better treat people with these disorders.""The study was published on February 18 in the Journal of Neuroscience.

Workers at the BP refinery walked off the job Sunday morning after failing to reach an agreement on a new contract. They join workers at nine other oil refineries and plants in the first nationwide refinery strike since 1980. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31beb3c000020010c4a73.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Adds Shell letter, background, detail)By Erwin SebaHOUSTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. refinery strike widened on its 20th day, with workers at the nation's largest refinery walking off jobs and joining picket lines on Saturday as the United Steelworkers union (USW) pushes for a new contract that improves wages and safety.Strikes are underway or have been called at 15 plants, including 12 refineries with a fifth of U.S. crude processing capacity. The stoppages, which have forced companies to rely on trained temporary workers to keep plants running close to normal, are the largest in the refining sector since 1980.Shortly after talks between union and oil company representatives ended on Friday night, the union notified Motiva Enterprises of a strike by its members at the company's 600,250 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in Port Arthur, Texas.USW members are also scheduled to go on strike by 12 a.m. Sunday at Motiva's 235,000 bpd Convent, Louisiana and 238,000 bpd Norco, Louisiana refineries and the Shell Oil Co chemical plant in Norco, the union said.""The industry's refusal to meaningfully address safety issues through good faith bargaining gave us no other option but to expand our work stoppage,"" USW International President Leo Gerard said in a statement.As of Saturday, no new talks had been scheduled between the two sides.Motiva was targeted for the strikes because it is a 50-50 joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Saudi Aramco . Shell's U.S. arm Shell Oil Co is the lead oil company negotiator in talks with the USW for a national agreement on safety, pay and benefits.Shell and the USW were near an agreement for a new contract on Friday night, but other oil companies were unwilling to accept the bargain, said sources familiar with the talks.""As the lead company, Shell has the role to get the oil companies to come along,"" said one of the sources. ""The (union) leadership group decided Shell needed to be put on the list of targeted companies.""A Shell spokesman said the company was disappointed by the Port Arthur walkout and strike notices to the Louisiana plants.In a letter Shell has sent to striking employees at its Deer Park, Texas, refinery and chemical plant, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, the company said the key sticking point was non-union contractors who perform daily maintenance, which the USW would like to see replaced with union workers.The company said it needed flexibility.""Hiring flexibility is a proven way to protect our core Shell workforce and the long-term economic viability of our workforce,"" the letter said. ""This strategy has served us all well, as we have not had to conduct any layoffs in decades.""The strike that began Feb. 1 was last expanded Feb. 6, when workers at BP Plc-operated refineries in Indiana and Ohio were told to begin a work stoppage the following day.Workers were already on strike at Shell's 327,000 bpd joint-venture refinery in Deer Park since the strike began on Feb. 1. MOTIVA ISSUESThe Motiva walkout may complicate operations at the Port Arthur refinery, which has several units shut but did return its second largest crude distillation unit (CDU) to full production on Friday night.The 195,000 bpd CDU is one of three at the refinery that do the initial refining of crude oil coming into the plant and provide feedstock for all other production units.The refinery's largest CDU, which has a rated capacity of 325,000 bpd is running at about 200,000 bpd, the sources said, because a 60,000 bpd hydrocracking unit is shut due to a malfunction. The hydrocracker produces motor fuel, primarily diesel, which has become a lucrative export for U.S. refiners.Motiva also shut a 92,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit at the refinery in early January for an overhaul. It is scheduled to restart in the first half of March.Shell and the union had been meeting continuously since talks resumed on Wednesday following a week-long break for the company to reply to an information request and a counterproposal from the USW.Union negotiators have rejected seven contract offer from Shell.The USW's lead negotiator, International Vice President Gary Beevers, has told Reuters that safe staffing levels were a point of contention in the talks.The union also wants ""no retrogression"" language, which preserves agreements from previous contracts.In addition to the BP plants, workers are striking at ones owned by Lyondell Basell, Marathon Petroleum, and Tesoro in California, Kentucky, Texas and Washington.Only one refinery has shut down due to the strike - Tesoro's 166,000-bpd plant in Martinez, California, which was previously scheduled to undergo maintenance.The USW wants a three-year pact that would cover 30,000 workers at 63 U.S. refineries with two-thirds of domestic capacity.

Today, we speak with Dr. Hussein Ibish about the Islamic State group's ideology.American media has been dominated this week by a renewed debate over the way we should understand the Islamic State group. The brutal militant group also known as ISIS has claimed control over parts of Syria and Iraq and was behind the beheadings of 21 Christian Egyptians in Libya this weekend. In part spawned by the cover story of this month's issue of The Atlantic, titled ""What ISIS Really Wants,"" there has been much hand-wringing over whether journalists and policy makers have got the militants' ideology all wrong.At the heart of this argument are conflicting views on the group's relationship to Islam, the role religion plays in its success and the best way of analyzing it in order to guarantee its defeat. The WorldPost discussed the issue with Dr. Hussein Ibish, a senior fellow at the American Task Force on Palestine. Ibish published an op-ed on the group in the New York Times this week, titled ""The ISIS Theater Of Cruelty.""What are some of the key ideas that the Islamic State group stands for and how should we understand their ideology?The way to understand them is by looking at where they converge and where they diverge from the more familiar violent radical Islamist groups such as Al Qaeda. What ISIS shares with Al Qaeda is the basics of its take on Islam. This is a very strict, literalistic and harsh interpretation, influenced by Saudi Wahhabism but taken to an extreme. Theirs is a narrative about Muslims and the rest of humanity that emphasizes a kind of paranoid and chauvinistic reading of the world. It asserts that Muslims are under attack from Christian, Jewish and atheist forces and that Muslims have to organize to fight back. The idea is that through massive violence, Muslims can change the regional and global order to their benefit, that they don't have a stake at all in the regional and global order as it is and can create radical change on religious grounds. That’s what ISIS shares with the other groups that call themselves Salafists and radical jihadists -- the typical Muslim terrorist groups we’ve been familiar with since 9/11 and before.Where does the group diverge from others?They diverge on three key points. First is ISIS's emphasis on the end of time and their millenarian streak. This is much stronger in ISIS than it is in Al Qaeda or other Salafist groups. They really believe, or at least they argue, that they are God's chosen instrument for cleansing history and bringing about the end times, which they feel is rapidly approaching. This is not rhetoric you ever got out of Al Qaeda.The second big difference is that Al Qaeda's beliefs were informed by the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and having understood the role of outside powers in the Middle East. The founding Al Qaeda belief was the need for extreme Muslims to drive the West, in particular the United States, out of the Arab world so that regional governments, especially Saudi Arabia, could be overthrown and replaced with pure Islamic regimes. The founding argument of Al Qaeda, the Bin Laden argument, is to attack the so-called ‘far enemy,' the United States, in order to clear the decks to attack the 'near enemy.' ISIS, to the contrary, has argued that radical Muslims need to ignore the West as much as possible. They need to put off that fight as long as they can in order to gain strength and establish a caliphate, a state, and build their strength within that state. It’s kind of a Maoist interpretation of insurgency, where an organization would come out of the hinterland and establish a base in a fixed area and use that base to project power outward. Had they been allowed to, I think ISIS would have preferred not to confront the West for a much greater period of time. The final dispute between the more traditional groups and ISIS has to do with the caliphate. ISIS has declared its leader to be the caliph, the leader of all of the world's Muslims. It’s a very radical, hubristic thing to claim leadership and authority over everybody. The scope of their ambition is really much greater than traditional groups.Had they been allowed to, I think ISIS would have preferred not to confront the West for a much greater period of time.Going back to the Islamic State group's ideology and the notion of Millenarianism -- the kind of apocalyptic belief espoused by the group –- how sincerely is that belief among its members and what importance should we place on these beliefs?I think one has to take them extremely seriously. These ideological terms -- its millenarianism, so-called prophetic method and apocalyptic bent -- are the competitive advantage ISIS has over its rivals in the violent, crazy Muslim extremist constituency. This ideological message is unique and has proven very appealing and effective. It also has a sort of vicious cycle on the ground. If you filter ISIS’s success -- sweeping out of Syria into Iraq and rapidly taking territory -- through the lens of that prophetic and apocalyptic narrative it would seem to confirm the claim that ISIS is indeed god’s anointed weapon for bringing forward end times.So their apocalyptic beliefs are useful to create an identity-based extremist group, and then it’s also a valuable propaganda tool?Yes, it’s a great motivating factor. People tend to join extremist groups or movements out of a sense of profound conviction. I mention in my piece for the New York Times that I think this is the biggest volunteer recruitment drive since the Spanish Civil War. The analogy is sound in terms of size and the cosmopolitan nature of if, but also because of the extreme idealism that draws people. It is true that ISIS promises all sorts of profane pleasures like sex slaves and booty and plunder and martyrdom, so there is that very direct profane appeal, but there’s also a sort of high-minded appeal, a kind of fantasy of wanting to be part of that redemption of time and the glorious end days.There are people who have left ISIS saying ""It's not like we thought."" But ISIS propaganda is powerful in conveying to potential recruits they are joining something glorious. Just by the numbers, it appears appealing to a certain mindset. The group's propaganda videos are notorious for their brutality. What purpose do those videos serve?It's a recruiting drive more than anything else. It’s aimed at recruits -– young men all over the world who may try and join them.Many people argue that with these snuff videos, ISIS is trying to draw in countries like Egypt, Jordan and the United States. But based on their history, I argue that they’re trying to use these videos to deter further engagement, that they’re trying to exact a price. I don’t think they’re goading. Is there data on how effective these videos have been as recruitment tools? Yes and no. There are two metrics that can provide some indication of the videos' success, but neither will show a one-to-one correlation. The first metric is social media penetration; how much attention the videos are getting on social media and on forums. The reach of ISIS's videos has been much wider than those of other groups. The other metric is more distant, and has to do with the recruitment. According to intelligence reports, ISIS has been able to recruit internationally and locally at a faster pace than coalition bombing raids have been able to decimate their forces. It's estimated that coalition bombings have killed between 4,000 to 5,000 fighters in the last months, while it's estimated that at least 6,000 new foreign recruits have come into Syria and Iraq in the same period of time. That doesn't take into account local residents who have joined up. So if you were to look at recruitment, and particularly international recruitment, and make a correlation between that recruitment effort and its success and the power of the propaganda, you'd have to say it's been very successful. In terms of these videos being deterrents, that hasn’t had the intended effect. For example, after the group killed a kidnapped Jordanian pilot, Jordan launched a wave of airstrikes against its positions. Is this just bad policy making on the group's part?I’m willing to accept that there’s a real question mark over my interpretation of ISIS’s intention to deter potential foes with these videos. It could be that they are actually hoping to draw foes in, and if so then they’ve been successful. I stick with my idea, however, that their main intention is a deterrent effect because of their main approach to fighting enemies -- to postpone the battle so they can consolidate territory. They clearly would not have wanted to engage regional governments and the international community yet. But it's possible that some people in ISIS may want to draw forces in and others may think they can deter them. To understand whether or not ISIS miscalculated, it's important to understand the group's experience. They are rooted in the wider Salafist jihadist movement, which has its origins in the Afghan-Soviet war. Obviously I don’t want to oversimplify things, we did not create ISIS, but the war did certainly set the groundwork for these groups and the notion that it's possible to defeat great powers comes from there.ISIS has been dealing with a post-Bush United States, a government that wants to leave conflicts in the Middle East and not come back. So if ISIS has the sense that the U.S. deterrable, it doesn't shock me that some of them may believe that if you raise the price enough people in the U.S. will say ""the hell with it."" To some extent that is what happened with the U.S. in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Of course they misunderstood the United States, you don’t deter the country or the American people by killing Americans. That just doesn't work.They misunderstood the United States, you don’t deter the country or the American people by killing Americans.What kind of a lens should we be viewing the group through? This religion aspect is overwrought and there’s way too much investment in it on all sides of the argument. Some people say ""they’re not Islamic at all, this has nothing to do with religion, it’s purely about opportunism, power, extremist ideology."" I understand what they’re trying to say, but the entire framework of ISIS’s ideology and rhetoric and language and worldview is based in a certain interpretation of Islam.On the other hand, there are people who turn around and say ""this is only Islamic, this is just purely an extreme version of Islam and that’s all you need to understand it,"" and I think that’s completely wrong. First of all, from a historic standpoint, this is a very strange interpretation of Islam. You can find almost anything you want if you mine the enormous kaleidoscope of human history that is the incredible heterogeneity of the Islamic world through this swath of time.This religion aspect is overwrought and there’s way too much investment in it on all sides of the argument.Neither is ISIS authentically Islamic, nor is it in any meaningful sense not Islamic. It is a bizarre interpretation of Islam yoked to a political agenda which is very modern. If we just stop fretting about the relationship of ISIS to the religious base of its ideology and accept that it's a bunch of extremists who come out of a tradition that they manipulate to justify their crimes and their ambitions, it’s not so complicated. I do strongly think that the best framework for understanding them is as a millenarian identity group, but at the same time I don’t see anything to be gained by dismissing the Islamic component in this.You mentioned in your piece in the New York Times that there is a lack of counter-narratives. Are there precedents for something like this or will it have to be thought up?I think largely it has to be thought up. If Sunnis believe that ISIS is the best bet of protecting themselves from Syrian President Assad or defeating Assad they will have a powerful recruiting tool. The same goes in Iraq, where people in the Sunni areas need to feel they can empower themselves without ISIS, but it’s very hard to do that when Shiite militias are conducting massacres. It's more complicated on the level of the international recruitment drive, where ISIS propaganda becomes more important. This is where I think we certainly need a counter-narrative, and it’s going to take a good deal of planning and coordination to come up with it.Ultimately, though, I think you need a different political reality for the region. As long as the politics of the region are as dysfunctional and bleak as they are now, it’s going to be hard to look forward to a day without ISIS or ISIS-like groups. Much better functioning polities and governments in the region is something that is going to take decades, but it’s necessary. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. It has also been updated to address an error in word choice regarding the ""heterogeneity"" of Islam.More from The WorldPost's Weekly Interview Series: "

More than 66,000 ""family units,"" in addition to 57,000 unaccompanied minors, were apprehended at the border last summer while attempting to enter the U.S. Many of the women and children, coming from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in Central America, said they were fleeing violence. The surge at the border led the administration to revive long-dormant detention centers, where children and their parents could be held for long periods as they awaited hearings in immigration court. That detention was part of an ""aggressive deterrence strategy"" that President Barack Obama had called on lawmakers to design. In December, the American Civil Liberties Union sued Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson on behalf of 10 mothers who had been detained with their children. The lawsuit alleged that they had been held to send a message, and that the practice violated immigration regulations as well as due process rights in the Constitution's Fifth Amendment. ""The government may have policy reasons for wanting to deter migrants from fleeing to the United States to seek asylum, and it has a powerful array of tools with which to pursue such a policy,"" reads the complaint. ""But a blanket No-Release Policy -- which deprives families with bona fide asylum claims of their liberty in order to send a message to others -- is not one of them."" Friday's ruling puts the policy on hold pending a hearing later.""Defendants have presented little empirical evidence, moreover, that their detention policy even achieves its only desired effect -- i.e., that it actually deters potential immigrants from Central America,"" Boasberg wrote.The government argued the administration has broad authority to set immigration policy, especially in matters involving national security.Boasberg said the administration's authority is tempered by the Constitution and rejected the argument. ""Incantation of the magic words 'national security' without further substantiation is simply not enough to justify significant deprivations of liberty,"" the judge wrote. ""The court held that it was illegal to detain families based on deterrence. It made clear that the government cannot deprive individuals of their liberty merely to send a message to others,"" the ACLU's Judy Rabinovitz said in a statement. ""This ruling means that the government cannot continue to lock up families without an individualized determination that they pose a danger or flight risk that requires their detention.""Read the full order below: Immigration order"

All five men spent time in jail, until their convictions were overturned in 2002 after being proven innocent. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae070e240000500054d197.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 2014, the Central Park Five officially stopped being infamous: New York City settled the group's wrongful conviction lawsuit for $40 million. In some ways, the Central Park Five reached the status of folk legend: their story of wrongful conviction and imprisonment for the 1989 rape of an Upper East Side white woman known as the Central Park jogger stands now as a cautionary tale about what can happen to kids from Black and Latino communities at the hands of the police and other elements of the criminal justice system. In recounting that story, some people continue to incorporate a pernicious taint, speculating about their possible guilt. ""Weren't they wilding in the park with other kids?"" some would ask. Others would comment saying, ""I could/would never confess to a something I didn't do."" Or the theory some prosecutors liked to advance, ""Matias Reyes (the serial rapist and convicted killer, who actually raped and beat the jogger and confessed to acting alone), was a part of the group that included the Central Park Five and only he left DNA behind.People making those comments don't see the problem with what is now often referred to as ""police practices."" They failed to understand how vulnerable low-income, Blacks and Latinos are to being victimized as a result of those practices. ""Police practices"" include the reading of black skin as less valuable, interpreting violations of the rights of black people as institutionally acceptable, seeing things like intimidation and coercion to illicit statements/confessions as permissible, and accepting a history of police penchant for violating sacred rights of Blacks. The ""practices"" also included more aggressive behaviors such as viewing the use of excessive force against Blacks as allowable and lethal force against Blacks as more justifiable. Within that mindset, the ""relatively"" less aggressive acts like the use of intimidation and coercion to illicit false confessions, as in the case of the Central Park Five in New York City, exists on the same trajectory as the fatal shooting of Michael Brown and the callous treatment of his body by the Ferguson police. Those five children who were wrongfully convicted for raping the jogger were supposed to disappear into the position they were expected to occupy in this nation: short on opportunity, short on resources, limited in hope, limited in dreams. They were part of the indistinguishable mass of dark bodies that aren't supposed to matter. After their convictions were overturned in 2002, members of the Central Park Five made their lives matter by speaking out in schools and community centers about what had been done to them. Their main goal was to help young people, particularly Black and Latino youths in the city, understand how vulnerable they were to the ""police practices"" that had snatched a portion of their lives from them. Then in 2012, the documentary ""The Central Park Five"" was released internationally. The Central Park Five had a world stage to tell their story. They crisscrossed the country taking their story to as many platforms as would have them. Their work never seemed personal; it represented a commitment to change the life chances of the dark bodies that were deemed throwaways, a commitment for social justice.In June 2014, when the city announced its settlement with the Central Park Five, many people wondered about its significance. Some things were clear: it couldn't make up for the portion of their lives lost in the system and it didn't address the ""police practices"" that led to their wrongful convictions. It did not undo the institutionalized way in which police in New York City and across the nation sent the message that dark bodies were disposable because they only represented a criminal element. The settlement could only be a moment of hope with mixed feelings.Then in July 2014, the world got more evidence of what it means when the trajectory on which ""police practices"" that led to the wrongful convictions of the Central Park Five is not disrupted. About a month after the settlement was announced, an African-American man named Eric Garner died after being placed in a chokehold by a cop on Staten Island, New York. Garner's death on July 17th resurrected my childhood memories of the death of graffiti artist, Michael Stewart, who died at the hands of Transit Police, after being beaten and placed in a chokehold after they found him spray painting his name in a Manhattan subway station.Less than a month after Garner's death, Michael Brown was fatally shot by police in Ferguson, MO. The ensuing protests sought to deliver a central message: Black lives matter. Reminders keep piling up that the message is not understood. The ""practices"" that led to Garner's death and the trajectory they exist on that ensnared the Central Park Five has a long history that requires commitment and vigilance to fight. On the day the city announced its settlement with the Central Park Five, one of the five, Raymond Santana said, ""Today is supposed to be a joyful celebration. ... (But) I want to put the gloves back on. I don't know how to take them off. ... All I know is to fight for injustice.""This post is part of the ""28 Black Lives That Matter"" series produced by The Huffington Post for Black History Month.

It was in the kindergarten classroom of Oliver Wendell Holmes Elementary School, in my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, where I was instructed by a sweet, portly Caucasian teacher. She wore fashionable cat-eyed eyeglasses, having two diamond studs affixed where the right and left arms of the eyeglasses were connected. She instructed me to smear yellow paint around on paper with my fingers. ""Finger painting,"" she called it, so I began moving my fingers through the paint, swirling and gliding from one edge of the paper to another, lost in what I felt was a messy use of the thick, musty-smelling paint, but it was fun nonetheless. Then seemingly out of nowhere, a glob of blue came down right on to the center of my great work. I looked up and it was my teacher and the way she looked now was not so sweet. In fact, the look in her eyes made her appear quite sinister. I thought that she must have been waiting for this moment to commit this evil act against my work and me.   With a twinkle in her eyes and a toss of her head, she indicated for me to look back to my work. When I turned back to my painting, I noticed that I was no longer swirling and gliding. I was moving my fingers in an up and down motion, and I could also see, to my chagrin, that the blue paint was turning my yellow paint into what would become my favorite shade of green. It was at five years old, at Oliver Wendell Holmes, in the classroom of a heavyset woman who fancied cat-eyed glasses and whose name I remember only as ""Teacher,"" where my love for the arts was born.   In my preteen years, during the summer months, school was out and all of our days were filled with whatever fun activities my friends and I could find in our neighborhood. During those long, hot summer days children in the community who had musical instruments would unite and form bands. Some groups had lead singers and backup singers. Of course, these young musicians and their singers honed their talents in the local churches that seem to be on every street corner in our exclusively Black community, utilizing the musical instruction they learned during the school year. They would practice all summer, preparing for the school's annual talent show competition.  By the end of junior high school, I was certainly able to discern the difference between the aspects of a violin and a viola, a harpsichord and an organ, a bassoon and a tuba, and so on. That grammar school education in the arts gave me the ability to appreciate music genres beyond the wonderful black music that I grew up listening to. It also provided me with a way to cope with the uncertainty that surrounded me when I was a boy. I think that it is unfortunate that school age children are not afforded the benefit of the arts in public schools as they once were.   African American children are the descendants of the chattel slaves of the United States, whose forefathers ultimately brought the world gospel, blues, jazz, doo wop, bebop, soul, rock and hip hop, the instrument called the human beat box and more. This music was born out of the pain and suffering that African Americans have endured since arriving in America nearly five centuries ago. There is nothing more haunting than hearing the hateful stories as told by an old Delta blues singer to express the discrimination of Jim Crow laws against the African American. Hip hop music picks up were the blues left off, lyrically illuminating racial discrimination and brutality against African Americans in modern times. The descendants of those marvelous people are able to persevere, having used the arts from as far back as the day that they were first brought to these shores. They have used the arts as an ointment to soothe a deep, dreadful suffering.  These days, usually without formal instruction in public schools and with most parents unable to afford private music lessons, the African American child is relegated to creating replicated sounds of musical instruments through the use of computer programs, loops, guitar or piano samples and synthesizers. If they look to their souls and through their experiences, just like their ancestors, they will always find a way to the arts, inventing a new music genre and a new dance to go with it.   Artistic expression unlocks and strengthens the imagination. It enlightens, enriches, and heals. Through painting, writing, poetry and music, the arts have provided me with an ability to express my feelings, thoughts, ideas and imagination in ways I am certain I would not have been able to in my life otherwise. The arts have been my companion from the time I was a child, preparing me early in my life for the work in the arts that I enjoy today. It is my hope that visual and performing arts be restored to public schools so that young people can have the advantage of unlocking their imaginations and sharing their talents with the world.This post is part of the ""Black Future Month"" series produced by The Huffington Post and Black Lives Matter for Black History Month.

I was concerned that it might end up being nothing more than a ""box-checking"" exercise. I was troubled that it might be perceived as targeting American Muslims and fostering a sense of increased alienation for some, while at the same time feeding the sense of suspicion that could result in a spike in hate crimes against Muslims. I was also wary of the fact that ""CVE"" had become a hustle for some social entrepreneurs who were set to spawn a ""cottage industry"" as potentially lucrative and as utterly misdirected, useless, and counterproductive as the enterprise created by the so-called ""terrorism experts"" of a generation ago.  Nevertheless, I went and I participated. There were, to be sure, a few ""hustlers"" in attendance and there were a few sessions that felt like ""box-checking"". And then there were some Muslims who protested the event convinced that any discussion of Muslims would contribute to more discrimination against their community. This, however, was not what defined the summit for me because what I also found at the White House were some remarkable people who were doing some extraordinary things in communities around the US. I had been asked to chair one of the summit's session and marveled at the conversation that ensued. The room was full of good people--political, business, faith, and community leaders from across the US, Europe, and Africa--all of whom were making a determined effort to build bridges and promote understanding. As we have found so many times before, while current challenges may have brought out the worst in some, it has also created the opportunity to bring good people together to support each other.  What ultimately made the day work was the closing address by President Obama. Playing multiple roles--teacher, analyst, sympathetic parent, and inspirational leader--his remarks were ""pitch perfect.""  With the US leading a broad coalition of countries that has been militarily targeting ISIS, the President was keen to lay out a strategy to take on the ideology ISIS uses to recruit disaffected alienated youth.  Challenging and defeating ISIS will, the President noted, involve more than the coalition's military might. It will require challenging their ideology and dismantling their recruitment infrastructure. And that was his focus.  The extremists' ideology must be discredited. The economic and political grievances exploited by the terrorists must be addressed. And partnerships must be developed with Muslim communities so that they can be empowered to challenge the false and dangerous goals posed by extremists.  What the President was making clear was that it is disaffection, anger, or alienation that makes young people susceptible to the ideas of extremists. But while the purveyors of violence can prey off of discontent, they have nothing real to offer. This must be made clear before recruits are seduced and drawn into the extremists' web. To do this will take the concerted action of communities working together.  The President continued his tough rhetoric against ISIS and was forceful in his resolve that they be defeated. But the President was also clear that in targeting ISIS and other forms violent extremist ideology, the U.S. and the West, in general, were not at war with Islam, since this is exactly how ISIS and al Qaeda want to frame the conflict. He said,  ""They are desperate for legitimacy. They try to portray themselves as religious leaders--holy warriors in defense of Islam...and they propagate the notion that America is at war with Islam. That's how they recruit...[but] it is a lie...They are not religious leaders - they're terrorists. And we are not at war with Islam.""  Not surprisingly, it was on this last point that the president's critics pounced. For days now, Republicans and several media analysts, instead of focusing on what the President did say, have been relentless in attacking him for what he didn't say. Apparently, what they wanted the President to say was that this was, in fact, a war against ""Islamic terror"" or ""radical Islam"". Said one critic, ""you can't win this war, if you can't name the enemy"". Senator John McCain responded to Obama by accusing him of propagating ""a big lie"".  The most strident attack came from former mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, who said,  ""You've got to be able to criticize Islam for the parts of Islam that are wrong...what's wrong with this man that he can't stand up and say there's a part of Islam that's sick?""  Answering his own question, Giuliani added that the problem with ""this man"" is that ""[he] doesn't love America...[because] he wasn't brought up...through love of this country"".  Not only were their criticisms disgraceful and insulting, Giuliani and McCain were also dead wrong. The President's message has been tough enough and smart enough. He has built a coalition that has mobilized most of the Muslim World, involving them as partners in the fight against violent extremism. The President has chosen a path designed to isolate and ultimately destroy what he has referred to as a ""death cult"". That's smart and tough.  On the other hand, if McCain and Giuliani had their way, we would be digging ourselves deeper into the holes dug by the Bush Administration. We would be in the midst of a ""clash of civilizations"". And Sarah Palin would be a heart-beat away from the Oval Office. That's neither smart, nor is it tough. It's just plain reckless.Follow @AAIUSA for more."

He said Saturday marked his tenth official visit to the country, even though it was his first at the helm of the Department of Defense.Neither he nor Ghani made predictions about peace efforts with the Taliban, after senior Pakistani army, Afghan and diplomatic officials said the Afghan Taliban signaled they were willing to open peace talks.But Ghani sounded upbeat.""The grounds for peace have never been better in the last 36 years. Our approach is productive. We're hopeful,"" Ghani said.""But categorical answers in a peace process are dangerous.""

By telling the story of the nine black teenagers who were wrongly accused of rape in Alabama in 1931, national attention was brought to the travesty of justice that helped spark the American Civil rights movement and led to two seminal Supreme Court rulings. In April 19, 2013, 82 years after the Scottsboro boys were arrested, the Alabama legislature had universally approved the passage of The Scottsboro Boys Act, exonerating the boys. How apt were Kander & Ebb's lyrics ""what was a whisper is now a roar.""  The following November of 2013 'the roar' grew even louder when the last three boys were pardoned. They were pardoned the same day the production was happening at the Young Vic Theater, in London. Just as the mother of one of the boys, Ava Wright, had traveled to London in 1932 to bring attention to the boys' plight, so The Scottsboro Boys journeyed to London in 2013 to share the production with a broader audience outside the United States.  Though the story is clearly an American tale of racism against blacks, London embraced the show. London understood it was a tale of injustice, prejudice, of what is right, of what is wrong. And London responded to the brilliance of Kander and Ebb's music, Susan Stroman's direction, David Thompson's book. They responded to a difficult story being told within the context of a bold, entertaining musical.  At the Young Vic, The Scottsboro Boys was sold out and extended, playing to standing ovations every night, not something that is typically done in London. We were honored to receive five star reviews and win the Critics' Circle Award for Best Musical and to receive six Olivier nominations.  With fellow lead producers, Paula Marie Black and the Young Vic, and a committed producing team, we then moved the show to London's West End Garrick Theatre in October, 2014 for a 20 week run. We were again deeply humbled, winning the Evening Standard Award for Best Musical and receiving an unprecedented number of five stars reviews.  Most important, and what is most gratifying, this American tale has touched the hearts and souls of Londoners. There is nothing more important and meaningful to the producers, creatives, cast and all involved to get countless emails and tweets expressing how the production moved and inspired people, particularly the young people. Many came back two and three times. The following aren't the critics' professional reviews, but words from individual audience members.One underprivileged, white youth said 'he discovered there was a world he'd never dreamed of, that someday perhaps he would be able to do something with his life, that The Scottsboro Boys cast made him feel that anything was possible if you had courage.'The following email is from a 15 year old boy. Amazingly enough, his surname is Leibowitz, the name of the famous Jewish lawyer who helped save the Scottsboro Boys. What he wrote captures so beautifully why theatre must be done:I think it was about ten minutes in that I was caught, aware that something was going on inside me, that I was being changed somehow... I had left the house as one person and had came home as another. Another email:The way in which this most appalling story was told, using music, satire, comedy, pathos and drama, was brilliant. The show evoked so many emotions, anger, outrage, laughter...sympathy, helplessness, amazement and enjoyment. In over 40 years - the best (show) we have ever seen, nothing else comes close.Tweets:""Theatre is about being amazed and learning something. SB certainly fulfills that... wish it could go on...I need to shout about the SB! Jaw dropping, bone-chillingly incredible. Was smiling and toe-tapping, then shaking and sobbing. Wow!! This Saturday, Feb. 21, after nearly 100,000 people in the UK have experienced this extraordinary production, London will be saying goodbye to The Scottsboro Boys.London, we thank you for opening your hearts. The show played more than twice as long in the West End as on Broadway. At one of our emotional talk backs, one lovely American young student said with tears, ""Please. Bring the show back to the US. We need it."" Perhaps now is the time for the show to return. Happily many cities have expressed interest in bringing The Scottsboro Boys to their theatres including Washington, D.C., but no dates have been confirmed as yet. With the success and timely importance of The Butler, 12 Years a Slave and now Selma, maybe it is time for The Scottsboro Boys to tell their story again in the United States.At the end of the show, the cast sings ""Say Goodbye to the Scottsboro Boys."" It is an entertaining, show biz, but powerfully complex number, infused with anger. It grabs the audience. The actors have done what they have set out to do. They have told their story their way. This time they have told the truth. They have made us laugh until we cried. They are challenging the audience. Say goodbye but, 'Don't forget us!' And we can't. The story of racism is not over. On Feb. 17, just a few nights ago in Paris, white Chelsea sports fans refused to let a black man enter the train, shouting racial slurs.In the US, there is a new nine: The Central Park 5, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Michael Gross, Akai Gurley. But these are only the names in the papers now. Unfortunately, there will be another new 'nine'. The Scottsboro Boys leaves us with the one clear message about what is right, what is the truth, what must not be forgotten. Now it is up to the audience to remember.http://www.scottsboromusicallondon.com/, http://www.wowcatherine.com, Facebook: Catherine Schreiber Productions, Scottsboro Boys Musical London"

(Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae070f1f0000250122d4f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It wasn’t until years later that Collins, the son of Malcolm’s sister, Ella Little Collins, would learn what his uncle was thinking: “We didn’t land on Plymouth Rock. The rock was landed on us.”Malcolm X, the African-American nationalist leader and onetime minister of the Nation of Islam who was assassinated 50 years ago Feb. 21, inspired countless people with the frank and uncompromising way he spoke about race relations in America. And much of what he said about the experiences of black Americans remains true today, experts say.Yet, while other civil rights leaders of the 1950s and ’60s are more broadly celebrated as American heroes, the fire with which Malcolm X spoke still overpowers the words he was saying.“With the exception of the hip-hop generation, with the exception of urban African Americans, his legacy has been tarnished as having done very little and having been part of a vision of America that is anti-American,” said Khalil Gibran Muhammad, executive director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York, which holds writings and personal memorabilia of Malcolm X.Born in 1925 as Malcolm Little, he became a Muslim and a member of the Nation of Islam while serving time in prison for burglary. He dropped his surname, saying it was a slave name.Malcolm X drew thousands of followers to the Nation of Islam with his charisma and oratory that admirers say shined a light on disadvantages for blacks in terms of poverty, education, police brutality and residential segregation.Detractors labeled him as “militant,” saying he preached violence and racism because of his early-career rhetoric declaring whites the enemy. At one point shortly before his death, Malcolm X wanted to bring charges against the United States at the United Nations, alleging human rights violations against black Americans.But Malcolm X demanded liberty and freedoms not just for black Americans, but for all humans, Collins says. “His legacy is the testimony of what one can strive and do for the liberty of others,” he said.Collins said his uncle was not urging blacks to act as aggressors. Rather, he was telling them they had a right to defend themselves against lynchings and other violence perpetrated by whites.In a sense, Malcolm X was considered militant because he had a much more radical critique than other activists of the time, Muhammad said.And that more radical position, Muhammad said, gave Martin Luther King Jr. and his political allies more of a middle ground from which to campaign for civil rights.“He’s still the foil to Dr. King,” he said. “He still plays the bad guy and the one who did not have a vision of a universal brotherhood.”But Malcolm X and King moved closer together in terms of their visions as their lives progressed. Malcolm X shifted away from his separatist views after a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1964. He embraced a more universal vision of brotherhood, similar to one King espoused, Muhammad said. King, meanwhile, focused more broadly on human rights issues Malcolm X had pushed.Had both men lived past 39, experts say Malcolm X and King likely would have had a meeting of the minds and would have provided greater focus on advances for blacks beyond basic civil rights.“I think black Americans would have had a more unified answer to King’s last question of ‘Where do we go from here?’ ” said Clayborne Carson, founding director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University.Collins said Americans shouldn’t just think of Malcolm X as a firebrand but should be inspired by him to understand and be vigilant about liberties for all.“We have to be a community and not just a community of one. We have to be a community of all and everyone. Not just black, not just white,” he said. “Skin color is not who you are. It’s your consciousness.”(Cervenka also reports for the Asbury (N.J.)

Belgian town crier advertising performing arts shows (Abu-Fadil)No visit would have been complete without a stroll down Les Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert to feast one's eyes on the enclosed domed mall's classical architecture, marble storefronts, and exquisitely displayed merchandise. Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert (Abu-Fadil)A key attraction in Belgium, besides historical monuments and fascinating museums, is the rich cuisine and mouth-watering selections of fine chocolates.So our merry band made multiple stops at several famous chocolatiers to stock up on gifts and elaborate creations for personal consumption.This isn't your supermarket variety, and calories aren't even part of the conversation.  Valentine's Day treats (Abu-Fadil)It's chocolate truffles with flavors such as tiramisu, classical cream, cappuccino, and dark chocolate. But I highly recommend the cognac and champagne varieties. Chocolate truffles heaven (Abu-Fadil)Whether it's caramels, pralinés, cones, marzipans, liquors, candied fruits dipped in chocolate, chocolate fruit cups, crunchy wafers or nougats from Neuhaus, Godiva, Corné Port-Royal, Leonidas, La Belgique Gourmande, or some artisanal mom-and-pop chocolatier, you indulge and you bulge, with a great big smile on your face.    Mouth watering chocolate fruit cups (Abu-Fadil)That chore and the purchase of a Tintin comic book done - the cartoon character is Belgian - it was time to think of dinner.Several other colleagues joined us at the landmark Chez Léon on a side alley off the Galeries. A sought-after specialty is mussels (prepared in more ways than I can remember), fries and beer for a decent 16 Euros ($18.41) service and tax included, but the full range of seafood is an epicurean delight and there's always fresh bread and butter to get one started. Moules, frites et bière Chez Léon (Abu-Fadil)For the uninitiated, fried potatoes as we know them are Belgian, not French, and the best way to cook them is in lard. The country also boasts some 400 varieties of beer.Did anyone say calories?The following day I spent most of the morning at the Belgian Comic Strip Center, about which I've already blogged. The art form is quite popular, has a substantial history in Belgium, and is enshrined in several museums.Next stop was the iconic Manneken Pis statue of the little boy relieving himself into a fountain at the corner of two streets near the famous Grand-Place.

Screen shot of ""If it's Tuesday, this must be Belgium""In this case, I was on a one-day business trip to Brussels this month, but extended it by a day to re-visit some places I liked, and discover one or two new ones.The whirlwind journey meant flitting between key locations, cramming as much as possible braving 0 degrees Celsius (32 F) with some light snow during the day and minus 4 at night.I convinced some visiting Arab journalist friends to join me for an afternoon/evening tour of downtown Brussels since they were leaving the following day and I was staying a bit longer. Belgian town crier advertising performing arts shows (Abu-Fadil)No visit would have been complete without a stroll down Les Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert to feast one's eyes on the enclosed domed mall's classical architecture, marble storefronts, and exquisitely displayed merchandise. Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert (Abu-Fadil)A key attraction in Belgium, besides historical monuments and fascinating museums, is the rich cuisine and mouth-watering selections of fine chocolates.So our merry band made multiple stops at several famous chocolatiers to stock up on gifts and elaborate creations for personal consumption.This isn't your supermarket variety, and calories aren't even part of the conversation.  Valentine's Day treats (Abu-Fadil)It's chocolate truffles with flavors such as tiramisu, classical cream, cappuccino, and dark chocolate. But I highly recommend the cognac and champagne varieties. Chocolate truffles heaven (Abu-Fadil)Whether it's caramels, pralinés, cones, marzipans, liquors, candied fruits dipped in chocolate, chocolate fruit cups, crunchy wafers or nougats from Neuhaus, Godiva, Corné Port-Royal, Leonidas, La Belgique Gourmande, or some artisanal mom-and-pop chocolatier, you indulge and you bulge, with a great big smile on your face.    Mouth watering chocolate fruit cups (Abu-Fadil)That chore and the purchase of a Tintin comic book done - the cartoon character is Belgian - it was time to think of dinner.Several other colleagues joined us at the landmark Chez Léon on a side alley off the Galeries. A sought-after specialty is mussels (prepared in more ways than I can remember), fries and beer for a decent 16 Euros ($18.41) service and tax included, but the full range of seafood is an epicurean delight and there's always fresh bread and butter to get one started. Moules, frites et bière Chez Léon (Abu-Fadil)For the uninitiated, fried potatoes as we know them are Belgian, not French, and the best way to cook them is in lard. The country also boasts some 400 varieties of beer.Did anyone say calories?The following day I spent most of the morning at the Belgian Comic Strip Center, about which I've already blogged. The art form is quite popular, has a substantial history in Belgium, and is enshrined in several museums.Next stop was the iconic Manneken Pis statue of the little boy relieving himself into a fountain at the corner of two streets near the famous Grand-Place. It's been there since the 1600s.

The actor recently told the L.A. Times he was ""tied to [the 'stache] now."" He also opened up about other aspects of his character's look, adding, ""I wanted to have gray hair for 'True Detective,' but it was hard because of dye jobs for other roles. I try to have as blank a canvas as possible when going into a new gig.""Of course, Farrell and Kitsch aren't the only fresh faces coming to Season 2. The all-new star-studded cast also includes Vince Vaughn and Rachel McAdams.

He isn’t,"" Giuliani said. ""Logically, think about his background ... The ideas that are troubling me and are leading to this come from communists with whom he associated when he was 9 years old.”President Barack Obama lived in Indonesia at that age with his mother and stepfather. “From the time he was 9 years old, he was influenced by Frank Marshall Davis, who was a communist,” Giuliani told the New York Post.Giuliani pointed to Obama being introduced by his grandfather to Davis, a member of the Communist Party, and his former membership in the church of activist Rev. Jeremiah Wright as reasons why his assertions were correct.The former GOP presidential candidate told CNN on Saturday that he had received death threats in the wake of his controversial comments, but that he ultimately did not regret making them."
