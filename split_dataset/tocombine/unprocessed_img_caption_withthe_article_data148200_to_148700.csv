3,WELLNESS,Breakthrough Designation: Drugmakers Cheer 'Speed Lane' For FDA Approval,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/breakthrough-designation-fda-drug-approval_us_5b9d6123e4b03a1dcc87461e,"In the 1990s, she said, the agency was not seeing drugs whose promise could be detected in early clinical trials. J&J's ibrutinib",2013-07-24,USA - 2001: 3 col. x 5 inches/164x127 mm/558x432 pixels Kurt Strazdins color illustration of the initials 'FDA' along with pills and prescription medicine bottles. (MCT via Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d61233c00004c000a2075.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Toni ClarkeWASHINGTON, July 24 (Reuters) - A new regulatory pathway could shave years off the traditional drug approval process in the United States, according to some companies whose drugs have been given ""breakthrough therapy"" designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Speaking at a briefing in Washington to raise awareness of the drug review process, Dr. Jay Siegel, head of global regulatory affairs at Johnson & Johnson, said he expects two years to be knocked off the time it would typically take the FDA to review ibrutinib, the company's experimental cancer drug.To be granted breakthrough designation, an experimental drug must show early indication of clinical improvement over existing therapies, even if the clinical trial is small. It might apply, for example, to a new type of cancer drug that shows strong early promise.J&J's ibrutinib, which it is developing with Pharmacyclics Inc, would be the first in a class of oral medicines that block a protein known as Bruton's tyrosine kinase. It is being developed for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and for patients with mantle cell lymphoma, both cancers of the blood.Dr. Jeffrey Leiden, the chief executive of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, who also spoke at the briefing and whose cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco was approved under the designation, said his company's experience working with the FDA was dramatically different from the normal drug approval process.Under breakthrough designation, he said, ""everything is on the table"" for discussion in order to move the process along as quickly as possible. Communications that might typically take weeks and months, under the breakthrough pathway take minutes.""We pick up the phone and talk in real time,"" Leiden said. ""It makes the process immeasurably smoother.""The breakthrough pathway was spearheaded by Friends of Cancer Research, a patient advocacy organization. It received bipartisan support in Congress and was signed into law in July 2012. As of July 12, the FDA had received 67 requests for breakthrough designation. It had granted 24 and denied 18.Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's drugs division, said during the discussion that the breakthrough pathway was designed to accommodate new science, particularly targeted therapies that may work in people with certain genetic mutations. She noted that just because the review process is speeded up there is no guarantee of approval.In the 1990s, she said, the agency was not seeing drugs whose promise could be detected in early clinical trials.""We didn't see these therapies in Phase I or II where you said 'bingo,' you've got a likely winner,"" she said.Still, there are challenges associated with speeding up a drug's development timeline. For one thing, other nations might not be willing to approve the products based on the FDA's more flexible clinical trial standards under the breakthrough designation.""Our hope is that foreign regulators will catch up,"" Siegel said.Moreover, he said, it is not clear that insurers will pay for drugs if the data do not show improved survival or other clear benefit they are used to seeing when drugs are approved. One task, he said is to figure out ""how to bring payors on board.""The panelists did not discuss what happens once a drug reaches the market under the breakthrough designation.Under a separate pathway known as ""accelerated approval"" drugs may be approved based on a so-called surrogate endpoint - a measure, such as tumor shrinkage - that might reasonably be expected to confer a clinical benefit such as improved survival.Companies that win approval for a product under the accelerated approval process are required subsequently to prove through further clinical trials that the surrogate measure does in fact correlate with improved survival or a reduction in disease symptoms.""A discussion on this topic is reckless if it doesn't discuss the next stage after the drug reaches the market,"" said Sidney Wolfe, co-founder and senior adviser to Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a watchdog organization that has frequently criticized the FDA for approving, or failing to withdraw, drugs it considers unsafe.Woodcock said the FDA is now working to develop a mechanism to speed the development of breakthrough diagnostics that can be used in conjunction with new drugs to help identify which patients will respond to a particular therapy."

How you ask? Because I realized that self-image is about who you are as a person, not wholly how you look.",2013-07-23,2013-07-22-JoyasaSaucyRedheadFacebookFashionShow.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-07-22-JoyasaSaucyRedheadFacebookFashionShow.jpg,"On Wednesday, March 24th, 2010, my life changed and it will never be the same again. On this day, I learned of my stalker; something that would truly follow me around like a shadow for the rest of my days.   My stalker's name was Non-Hodgkins Follicular Lymphoma Cancer. We found out later it was stage four with involvement in a major organ (my kidneys) and in my bone marrow. There was nothing any law enforcement agency could do to protect me from it either.  Fortunately, after six intense chemotherapy treatments, each spaced three weeks apart, I achieved remission. Great news! But the ordeal was far from ""over,"" for I began a course of maintenance chemo. that would span another two years while I received another 12 treatments! I received one medicine through my port, which is implanted in my upper left chest between the breast and clavicle, every eight weeks. Additional good actually came from this devastating diagnosis. I really believe good can come from any obstacle life throws at us but we do have to make the choice about how we're going to respond to the obstacle. As a non-smoker who is relatively healthy (I have my sweet tooth and love ice cream!), my diagnosis came as a total surprise. I'm not going to tell you I didn't get mad or sad and shed tears over my diagnosis! But I chose not to stay there and as I moved into acceptance, I decided my response to this would be to fight with all I could using the power of positivity, a positive attitude and humor.   As I achieved remission, I was overpowered with the idea of ""Cancer with Joy."" This was doubly interesting to me because of the double meaning. I'm Joy, I was diagnosed with stage four cancer as a young adult, so it's helping people face ""Cancer with Joy,"" literally with me. It's also introducing to people this simple but profound concept of ""Cancer with Joy."" It's never been said quite that way before! What's unique about it is my story and the unique ways I faced ""Cancer with Joy"" and what I can contribute to the dialogue.  I wrote a book called Cancer With Joy: How to Transform Fear into Happiness and Find the Bright Side Effects. But I didn't explore the topic of how cancer impacts your body and self-image in-depth in the book. So let's have that conversation here. Cancer impacts all of us; from my experience of talking with many and introducing this new idea of ""Cancer with Joy,"" I have found every single person can tell me of someone they know currently in treatment or who had cancer.  In the book, I wrote the most emotionally painful moment for me was the complete loss of my shoulder-length hair due to one of the medicines they were giving me in treatment that killed all rapidly growing cells. My medical team tried to remind me the ""good news"" was when my hair was coming out, it meant the medicine was getting hair cells but likely also killing cancer cells.   All of a sudden waking up and going into the bathroom to reach for my toothbrush, since I must brush my teeth immediately upon waking, I didn't recognize the woman in the mirror. I was painfully aware and reminded of constantly by this image in the mirror all that cancer HAD been able to take from me while I was battling.   Ironically, I was getting back together with an old boyfriend (We met in 1997!) right when I was diagnosed and starting treatment. Our ""first date back together"" was not too long after I had my head shaved. I wanted to look ""like me"" as much as possible, so that night I opted to wear a halo (elastic ring of hair with hair that hangs down in the front for bangs, on the sides and in the back, with the bulk of your head being bald, and you cover the bald part with a fun hat! This is very cool in the hot Summer, trust me, since my first six chemo's were from April-August!). My ""hair"" was close to my former color, length and style, so I felt good.  As our relationship progressed, I agonized about the first night I was to stay over at his house. What would I do when the sun streamed in in the morning, lighting up my bald head and potentially horrifying him? He has always known me with chin-length hair at the shortest. See cancerwithjoy.com for a pre-cancer recent hairstyle (of me lying in the hospital bed at the first chemo.) and you can visit my contact page to contact me to learn about my ""Cancer with Joy"" live event! I went so far as to ask him if he had a guest bedroom I could sleep in!   I learned how to handle even complete hair loss from ""Cancer with Joy"" and now I'm helping many others thrive, from diagnosis through treatment. Remembering it is how you choose to respond, I chose to make fun out of this obstacle being thrown my way as a young adult! I had always wanted to see how I'd look as a ""saucy redhead!"" After ordering many different halos, wigs and hats from the Tender Loving Care catalog, I decided to have an ""Online Fashion Show"" and involved all my friends in the process to show them this unique way I was choosing to respond to the complete loss of my hair! My dear mom, my caregiver, took pictures of me modeling many different looks. I tried a variety of colors, lengths and styles! We uploaded the pictures to Facebook and invited my friends to ""like"" and comment to help me select my look(s) for the Summer of 2010! That's taking hair loss, the most emotionally painful moment for me during my cancer experience and truly facing ""Cancer with Joy!"" You see, what I was reminded of throughout my journey that I want to share with you is that your self-image should not be wholly defined by how you look. My cancer treatment definitely changed things about my body and how I looked, and I know many women who have had a mastectomy, which changes their body. Men's bodies change during cancer treatment and we all change anyway through the natural aging process. But, if this doesn't sound too crazy, my cancer experience probably improved my self-image. How you ask? Because I realized that self-image is about who you are as a person, not wholly how you look!!  Through the founding of my brand ""Cancer with Joy"" and the many good things that have come from my experience, I feel better about myself as a person because of what I'm able to contribute and how many I'm able to help just by giving. It's my sincere hope reading this simple story inspired you to think about how you're responding to obstacles and also helped you in some way as you consider your body and self-image. When how you feel about yourself comes from the kind of person you are, which you are free to choose and change, it gives you confidence of the staying kind that surpasses the messages media and others may try to impose on us.  If your ""stalker"" is a culmination of those messages from the media and those mean things we all say to ourselves, focus on improving your self-image through feeling good about who you are and what you give to others vs. how you look!

5,WELLNESS,How To Meditate Without Meditating At All,Kate Bratskeir,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ways-to-meditate-mindfulness-tips_us_5b9d5a0ee4b03a1dcc86fd47,Your meditation doesn't have to emulate the Buddha's 49-day retreat. Whether you think there's no time for a mindfulness,2013-07-23,A man sitting and meditating on a salt formation in the dead sea at sunrise.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d5a0e26000035007fd69c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Your meditation doesn't have to emulate the Buddha's 49-day retreat. Whether you think there's no time for a mindfulness meditation practice, or the concept of sitting in stillness is more daunting than restful, there are still ways to reap the benefits of the ancient art. That's right -- you can manifest an informal practice within your daily habits. You don't have to change your routine all that much: All it takes is tweaking your intention.Informal mindfulness practices are ones in which you pay attention to your moment-to-moment experience. These are ""everyday actives of life that can support the cultivation of mindfulness,"" writes Karen Kissel Wegela, Ph.D. on Psychology Today. ""When we engage in these activities, especially if we are willing to let go of distractions like listening to an iPod or playing the car radio, they give us the chance to tune into what is happening right now. We can pay attention to our sense perceptions, our emotions, and our thoughts.""Many successful people (like Oprah, Rupert Murdoch and even Arianna Huffington, to name a few) credit meditation for their razor-sharp focus, enviable level of productivity and bountiful amounts of creative juice. You, too can join this esteemed group of meditators without sitting cross-legged by candlelight. Here are a few ways to implement mindfulness into your everyday life. Try Some Mindful Cleaning Before you roll your eyes, think about the fact that you'll be killing two birds with one stone. Intrigued? Mindfulness coach and HuffPost blogger Patrick Groneman suggests a mindful dishwashing practice to do just this. ""Yes, it's not very sexy,"" he writes, ""but it can be a great chance to check in with our state of mind in the middle of our often-busy days.""If you're fortunate enough to have a dishwasher that does it all (except meditate, that is), consider turning your morning bed-making routine into a mindfulness practice. Your morning ritual probably already includes tucking in your sheets --next time, just add a genial dose of intention. Or, try a meditation while you vacuum (there's even a vacuum on the market that claims to help you find peace, but we think just an ordinary machine will do). Whatever chore you choose to transform into a head-clearing activity, just make sure you're doing it with purpose, and all of your attention on the task at hand.Find Some Zen In Shower   The mindfulness experts at Headspace explain how to take your shower routine off auto-pilot and make every cleansing action more intentional: [Be mindful] of the need to set the temperature before getting into the shower; mindful of the wave of pleasure as the warm water washes over you; mindful of the smell of the shower gel, soap or shampoo; mindful of the mind jumping forward, imagining conversations that have yet to happen; mindful of the amount of water you’re using; and mindful of the sound of the water coming to a stop.Go For A Run -- Sans iPod Sure, there's nothing like a kick-ass playlist to fuel your workout. But taking a break from your earbuds every now and again can help you keep a steady pace and become more aware of your body. You'll be more likely to engage all senses in what you're doing: You'll feel your feet against the ground and hear what's happening around you all the better without the distraction of any ""Blurred Lines."" Breathing in synch with the rhythm of your footsteps may also help you to regulate your breath, which could make you a stronger runner.Take A Stroll Down Memory Lane We mindlessly scan old albums on Facebook more often than we care to admit. Next time you decide to go down memory lane, click (or page through if you're holding an actual photo album) while accessing your conscious memory: Recall the person and moment in every photo, slowly. Savor your past: This practice will have you enjoying the memory a little bit more and appreciate your experiences. Drink Your Morning Coffee -- Without Distraction Or Rush Maybe your cup of joe is something you chug down while frantically searching for your keys for morning commute. It doesn't have to be this way: You can get more from your java than a jolt of caffeine if you choose to slow down. Life coach and Huff Post blogger Ora Nadrich describes a 14-step coffee meditation that will help you start your day with more presence. ""Even if having your morning tea or coffee is at your local Starbucks or Coffee Bean, you can sit there -- although it may not be quiet -- using this meditation technique to transcend the noise or talking around you by focusing and concentrating on mindful drinking,"" she ensures. Cook Something Using Heart And Attention ""As I make bread, I change. My thoughts go quiet. I come into the now,"" writes Amanda Cook, who has turned bread baking into a weekly meditation ritual. ""Flour. Salt. Water. Yeast. As I push the warm, soft dough against my palm, I feel the cold stone countertop underneath. I feel my hips leaning up against the cabinets. I hear my breath inside my head."" Rather than whipping up something simply for the sake of filling a grumbling belly, use the experience to connect to what you are doing in the moment. The dish doesn't have to be complicated -- what's most important is that your choosing to be conscious of every step of the process. Click here to find a step-by-step practice for mindful cooking.Write In Your Journal With 24 hours in a day, it's not hard for the smaller, less catastrophic events to escape us. But it is exactly these little moments -- a nice smile exchanged with a stranger, finding a long, lost sock -- we might not save in our consciousness that can propel us forward and keep us optimistic. Whether you choose to record your whole day or scribble down a couple of things for which you're grateful, the act of writing in your journal  can clear your head and make life feel more meaningful. Go Stargazing Our universe is a magical thing: Looking up -- whether at the stars or away from your phone -- is a perfect moment to be present. Take note of your surroundings: It might be the most simple way to practice meditation, all while appreciating beauty. What do you see, hear, feel, smell and taste? Go through all five of your senses individually, not judging, but just observing every sensation. For more on meditation, click here. "
