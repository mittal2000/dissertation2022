Many voters aren’t too happy with the GOP.. And backers of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump aren’t likely to their minds. This is HuffPollster for Friday, July 22, 2016. PUBLIC SATISFACTION WITH THE U.S. DROPS ‘SHARPLY’ - Art Swift: “Americans’ satisfaction with the way things are going in the U.S. dropped 12 percentage points in the past month, amid high-profile police killings of black men and mass shootings of police. Currently, 17% of Americans are satisfied with the state of affairs in the U.S. Satisfaction is the lowest it has been nationwide since October 2013, when Republican members in Congress led a federal government shutdown. For the past two years, satisfaction has been in the 20s and 30s, with low points of 20% in December 2015 and November 2014.This 12-point drop in one month is tied for the largest decrease in satisfaction since Gallup started asking satisfaction monthly in 2001….The decline in Americans’ satisfaction this month includes a particularly sharp drop among Democrats, whose satisfaction levels ― after registering 51% last month ― dropped 22 points to 29% in July….Racial strife, epitomized in the recent police shootings and shootings of police, and highlighted in ongoing protests, appears to have ignited new concerns about the state of the U.S.” [Gallup]  AMERICANS HAVE MIXED OPINIONS ON ‘BLACK LIVES MATTER’ - Samantha Neal: “Although more American voters see racial discrimination as a major problem than they did a little over a year ago, voters are divided as to whether or not the Black Lives Matter movement has made things better, according to a new poll by Monmouth University. This sentiment persists in the aftermath of multiple police shootings of black civilians….Only 10 percent of all nationwide voters say that the Black Lives Matter movement has made racial issues in the United States better, while 48 percent say it has made things worse. Fifty-five percent of white voters say the movement has made race relations worse, whereas 51 percent of black voters say it hasn’t had much impact….Other polls released earlier this month also point to the notion that race relations are worsening. Nearly 3 in 4 American voters say that race relations in the United States are bad, including 32 percent who characterize them as “very bad,” according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll. This statistic reflects a similar level of pessimism that was evident after the Rodney King verdict 24 years ago. A recent New York Times/CBS poll shows that racial discontent is at its highest point in the Obama presidency.” [HuffPost] 2016 PRIMARY LEFT VOTERS FEELING WORSE ABOUT THE GOP - HuffPollster: “In a HuffPost/YouGov survey conducted Tuesday and Wednesday, 48 percent of Republican voters said that Donald Trump was the best option for a nominee this year, while 40 percent said the party could have done better. By a 4-point margin, 32 percent to 28 percent, Republican voters say that this year’s election has made them feel worse, not better, about their party. Another 36 percent say their feelings haven’t changed….Sixty-two percent of the electorate as a whole, including a 56 percent majority of independent voters, say that Trump was not the Republicans’ best option. Half of all voters, including 48 percent of independents, say this year’s primary election has left them feeling worse about the GOP.” [HuffPost]MOST CLINTON AND TRUMP SUPPORTERS WON’T CHANGE THEIR MINDS - Christie Aschwanden: “We hold beliefs about how the world works and tend to force new information to fit within these pre-existing narratives. Psychologists call this motivated reasoning, and it means that once people have thrown their support behind Trump or Clinton, they will tend to downplay or ignore things that paint their candidate in a bad light….In a study conducted in October, researchers presented 507 self-identified Republicans and 986 self-identified Democrats with actual things that Trump had said — some of which were true and some of which were false….’If we told participants that it was Trump that said the misinformation, Republicans were much more likely to believe it and Democrats were much less likely to believe it,’ said Briony Swire, a Ph.D. candidate in cognitive psychology at the University of Western Australia, who conducted the study with colleagues at MIT and the University of Bristol….People whose support for Trump arises from animosity toward Clinton or discontent with the status quo are unlikely to be swayed by facts or revelations about Trump’s truthfulness or policy, and the same goes for Clinton supporters who loathe Trump.” [538] THE LARGEST COUNTIES IN THE U.S. ARE GETTING BLUER - Drew DeSilver: “Democrats tend to do best in the nation’s urban areas, while Republicans find their strongest support in more rural areas. Now, a new Pew Research Center analysis of county-level presidential-voting data quantifies just how dominant Democrats are in big cities – and analysts say this dominance will present a tough challenge to Donald Trump this November.….The last time a GOP presidential candidate won more than a third of the 100 largest counties was 1988, when George H.W. Bush took 57 of them….We took a closer look at vote patterns in the 83 counties that were among the 100 most populous in both 1976 and 2012. In more than half (46 counties), the Democratic-Republican split shifted in the Democrats’ favor by more than 20 percentage points; only nine became less Democratic to any degree.” [Pew]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

1,POLITICS,Voters Think This Boosts Donald Trump's Chances More Than Anything Else,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-government-dissatisfaction-poll_us_57912d2be4b0bdddc4d3c17f,And it has nothing to do with him.,2016-07-22,Balloons fall before Trump as the Republican convention ends on July 21.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579276a81200002a00a52fcf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans’ resentment toward Washington and near-record mistrust of most institutions helped fuel a Republican primary dominated by outsider candidates. Now, voters see that same dissatisfaction as the GOP’s most valuable asset in its effort to retake the White House.In a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, two-thirds of registered voters say that Americans’ current feelings about the government likely boost Donald Trump’s chances of winning the White House.Most registered voters also think Trump benefits from other factors outside his control, such as Barack Obama’s record as president and the current state of the nation’s economy and foreign policy. In contrast, they’re split as to whether one of Trump’s signature acts of demagoguery, his promise to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, will help or hurt him.Among Republican voters in particular, those national factors are also seen as more helpful to the GOP’s chances than their nominee’s own record. Eighty-two percent think Obama’s legacy will be a boon to Trump, while 79 percent and 80 percent, respectively, say the current state of the economy and the way Americans feel about the government will work to Trump’s advantage. Fewer ― 71 percent and 63 percent, respectively ― cite Trump’s work as a businessman or his selection of vice presidential nominee Mike Pence as advantages. Those results highlight a peculiar contradiction of the 2016 race. Historically, strong presidential approval ratings and economic numbers have translated into an advantage for the incumbent party. Obama’s popularity is on the upswing, as are views on his economic record ― two factors that would seem to augur well for Hillary Clinton’s chances in November.This year, however, voters don’t necessarily agree. Despite their rising opinion of Obama, most still see the country as being on the wrong track and would rather the next president take the country in a different direction ― something they doubt Clinton will do. Some political forecasters have suggested this desire for change could give the GOP a reasonable shot at victory.That is, if the Republicans had a different nominee. But Trump’s high unfavorability ratings, perceived lack of qualifications and chaotic campaign have put him at a disadvantage, and Clinton held a consistent lead in most pre-convention national polls. Sixty-two percent of all registered voters, including 40 percent of Republicans, say that Trump wasn’t the GOP’s best option.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted July 19 through July 20 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population."

The case is suspected to be non-travel related, but as of Thursday the state had not ruled out travel or sex as a potential cause of her infection, according to a spokeswoman.Late on Thursday, Florida also announced a potential Zika case in Broward County that was not related to travel.Florida has invited the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assist in the probe, and CDC senior medical epidemiologist Dr. Marc Fischer arrived on Friday.To determine whether a case was caused by local transmission, health workers need to survey households and neighbors within a 150-yard (137 meters) radius of an infected person’s residence, Fischer said at a CDC workshop on Thursday.He said that was basically the flying radius of the mosquitoes that spread Zika.More than 400 pregnant women in the continental United States have evidence of Zika virus infection, and 12 infants have been born with birth defects linked to Zika infections in their mothers, officials have said.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Will Dunham)"
3,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton: 'Ted Cruz Was Right',Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-ted-cruz_us_579297e1e4b01180b52f13ab,She praised the GOP senator for refusing to endorse Donald Trump.,2016-07-22,Hillary Clinton offered rare words of praise for Ted Cruz on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579298de1200002900a53046.jpeg?cache=szYR3KssA4&ops=crop_12_138_2988_1515%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton on Friday said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was “right” to refuse to endorse Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention.Cruz, who ran against Trump in the GOP primary, was booed off the convention stage Wednesday night after declining to endorse his party’s nominee. He instead urged Republicans to “vote your conscience,” a refrain used by the anti-Trump faction of the party. During a rally in Tampa, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee praised Cruz for his remarks.“Something has gone terribly wrong when one speaker says, ‘vote your conscience’ and gets booed,” Clinton said. “I mean, I never thought I would say these words, but Ted Cruz was right. In this election, do the right thing, vote your conscience, vote for your future, vote for a United States of America.”She also tore into Trump for claiming he “alone” can fix the nation’s problems, calling his vision “dark and divisive.”“Now, just think about that for a minute,” Clinton said. “Because it’s really important. His vision of America is one where we Americans are kind of helpless, we need to be rescued. I can’t really imagine him on a white horse, but that seems to be what he’s telling us.”She continued, “I’ve never heard of an American leader, or at least somebody who wants to be an American leader, claiming that he’s all we need. That’s not a democracy, my friends. As I recall, we had a revolution to make sure we didn’t have someone who said, ‘I can fix it alone.’” "

6,POLITICS,"In This Cleveland Family, Anti-Trump Doesn't Always Mean Pro-Clinton",Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-anti-trump-canvassers-hillary-clinton_us_57927229e4b0d3568f833471,"Canvassers are finding enthusiasm for anti-Trump pledges, but not always for the Republican's main opponent.",2016-07-22,"A family in Cleveland, Ohio, shows off their ""Ohio Against Hate"" T-shirts.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579276071200002900a52fce.jpeg?cache=s9PBguO7Fe&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND — On Thursday evening, as Donald Trump prepared to accept the Republican presidential nomination, three organizers — four, if you count the 5-year-old tagging along — set out to convince people in Cleveland’s Ohio City neighborhood to vote against him.One of their first stops was a blue two-story house where three adults, all of them white, sat on the front porch playing dominoes and watching four small girls play in the driveway. It was hard to guess how it would go — the organizers with Ohio Against Hate, who are Latino, said they most often get a friendly reaction but sometimes get quips about deportation instead.Fifteen minutes later, though, the entire family was wearing white T-shirts that read “Ohio Against Hate,” which campaign coordinator Jerry Peña fetched from his car after they complimented his. One of the women had signed a card pledging to vote against Trump. All of them said they dislike the GOP candidate.“I believe 100 percent he’s racist, and we’re far from racist here,” Mary Kile, 45, said of Trump. Her daughter Natalie Nelson, a 26-year-old mother of three who lives nearby, said she doesn’t like Trump either. “I hate that guy,” said Bill Kile, 47, Mary’s husband. When asked why, he joked, “You ain’t got enough time in the day,” but listed off the businessman’s bankruptcies and his now-defunct for-profit Trump University, which is facing a federal lawsuit for exploiting its students. Joseph Astronskas, Mary Kile’s 43-year-old brother, said he doesn’t like Trump’s deportation plan or the fact that he left Ohio in the middle of the Republican National Convention. “So basically, he don’t care about Ohio,” Astronskas said.Mary Kile signed the pledge card, which the group will mail back to her to remind her to vote ahead of the election. It was one more signature to add to the thousands of pledge cards collected in the state during a campaign led by Center for Community Change Action, People’s Action, MoveOn.org and local progressive groups, including Ohio Against Hate. The goal is to knock on doors in 16 states overall.But the family also demonstrated the challenges anti-Trump organizers still face when they talk to some potential voters. The Kiles, Astronskas and Nelson said they didn’t like Trump, but they weren’t enamored with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, either.Peña said they’ve run into that reaction before, including with people of color.“They’re like, ‘Give me that card, I’m pledging to vote against Trump in November,’” he said. “The part that we’re not hearing is ‘I’m voting for Hillary.’” At the Kiles’ house on Thursday, Nelson was the most anti-Clinton. She said the former secretary of state showed a “disregard for human life” and should have done more to prevent the death of Americans in a 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Mary Kile, who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president, said she likes Clinton but doesn’t like her stance on abortion.“I’m a Democrat, so that’s the only reason I’ll vote for her, is because Bernie’s not in the race,” she said. Astronskas said he doesn’t know much about Clinton or whom he will vote for, but that it doesn’t matter who’s president because “they’re going to do what they want to do” anyway. Bill Kile was the most enthusiastic about Clinton — he said he likes that she doesn’t let Trump bully her — but he also said he isn’t allowed to vote because he’s still on probation after a felony conviction.The organizers walked to the next house, passing a man in a grey Trump T-shirt without stopping to talk. At one house, a woman said she wasn’t sure who she would support, but took a pledge card and said she would send it if she decided to oppose Trump. Another man they passed on the street said he was happy to sign a card, as did Mark Pestak, 61-year-old scientist who called himself an “old white guy.” He is part of the Cleveland Non-Violence Network and participated in the recent People’s Convention, where groups created a platform and then tried to deliver it to Republicans in town on Thursday. Pestak said he supported Sanders and is a fan of Cornel West, whom he saw speak in Cleveland this week. West recently endorsed Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, and Pestak wants to find out more about her, although he hasn’t ruled out Clinton. As he was talking, his daughter’s friend, 22-year-old social worker Alyssa Holznagel, walked by. She said she also supported Sanders and would probably prefer to vote for Stein. But she’s planning to vote for Clinton because it’s the best way to keep a Republican from winning.“This is not the election to support the third party for me. I can’t do it,” she said. “As a social worker, reading the platform that just came out, it would just destroy my clients’ lives. I can’t not put my vote in the smartest spot to keep that from happening.”"

Eric Trump said his father finds the state of the American education system humiliating and told teachers “forced to walk through metal detectors” that his father was “running for you.” His brother had even stronger language to describe what he sees as the failure of the American public education system.“Our schools used to be an elevator to the middle class,” Donald Trump Jr. said. “Now, they’re stalled on the ground floor.

Bush-era No Child Left Behind Act as the law of the land for federal government policy. The act returns much of the authority for testing and accountability to states, a move that Democrats and Republicans in Washington largely agreed on.However, the new law does not “end Common Core,” which is regulated by individual states and not the federal government. Some, in both parties, have accused the Obama administration of forcing the adoption of the Common Core by tying money from competitive grant programs to having high quality standards, which was widely understood to mean Common Core State Standards. When asked for clarification, a McConnell staff member seemed to point to this argument by citing several of the majority leader’s previous statements on education, such as, in reference to the Every Child Succeeds Act: “It’s a bipartisan bill that would end the practice of states being coerced into adopting measures like Common Core.”The new Act does effectively end that practice. It explicitly limits the ability of the federal government to require specific standards or curricula “as a condition of eligibility to receive funds under this Act.”Thursday night, Republican National Committee’s chairman Reince Priebus went a step further in explicitly framing education reform as a partisan issue in his remarks. “Democrats want to put labor union bosses in charge of our schools, limit our choices and feed our kids a steady diet of their leftwing propaganda,” he said. “We know every child matters and the classroom is not an assembly line.”Ted Cruz, Newt Gingrich, Ivanka Trump and Melania Trump also mentioned education in passing, but none said anything about specific policy proposals. Vice Presidential nominee and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who has made education a regular talking point in his home state, did not mention education in his nomination acceptance speech.This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education."

It explicitly limits the ability of the federal government to require specific standards or curricula “as a condition of eligibility to receive funds under this Act.”Thursday night, Republican National Committee’s chairman Reince Priebus went a step further in explicitly framing education reform as a partisan issue in his remarks. “Democrats want to put labor union bosses in charge of our schools, limit our choices and feed our kids a steady diet of their leftwing propaganda,” he said. “We know every child matters and the classroom is not an assembly line.”Ted Cruz, Newt Gingrich, Ivanka Trump and Melania Trump also mentioned education in passing, but none said anything about specific policy proposals. Vice Presidential nominee and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who has made education a regular talking point in his home state, did not mention education in his nomination acceptance speech.This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education."

Much has changed since then, but this year’s meeting is poised to mark yet another milestone as Hillary Clinton is expected to be the first woman presidential nominee on a major party ticket. Here’s a look at some of the most interesting changes and historic moments over the years.1835 (Baltimore): The second convention was held only three years after the first. It occurred one and a half years before the 1836 election to dissuade potential opponents to Vice President Martin Van Buren, who was President Andrew Jackson’s hand-picked successor.1840 (Baltimore): This was the first Democratic convention that adopted a party platform. It included language about the role of the Constitution and states’ rights, declared that slavery was an issue for states to decide and opposed creation of a national bank.1852 (Baltimore): The nomination balloting lasted two days and stretched to 49 ballots, resulting in the coronation of Franklin Pierce, who had agreed to throw his hat in the ring if there were a deadlock.1856 (Cincinnati): The seventh Democratic convention was the first not held in Baltimore.1860 (Charleston, South Carolina): The convention ran for 11 days but ended without any nominations after a number of Southern delegates left because of a dispute over the party’s slavery platform. Less than two-thirds of the original delegates reconvened in Baltimore the next month to select nominees, and the Southern Democrats who had walked out met later to choose their own nominees.1872 (Baltimore): The Democratic Party didn’t nominate its own candidate this year, but rather endorsed the presidential and vice presidential candidates of the Liberal Republican Party, in a move aimed at defeating President Ulysses S. Grant. (He won re-election anyway.) The convention lasted just six hours, though that was spread over two days.1896 (Chicago): William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska roused the crowd, delivering a ferocious attack on the gold standard that is remembered as one of the greatest political speeches of all time. “You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold,” he roared. He secured the presidential nomination on the fifth ballot the following day.1900 (Kansas City, Missouri): The first woman delegate, Elizabeth M. Cohen of Utah, appeared at the convention.1924 (New York City): The 16-day convention was the longest in American history. Delegates voted in 103 ballots before deciding on the presidential nominee.1932 (Chicago): Traditionally, the party nominee waited at home to be informed of the nomination ― and sometimes didn’t hear the news until weeks later. But Franklin D. Roosevelt flew from New York to deliver an acceptance speech at this convention. In his speech, he spoke of a “new deal” with proposals to reduce unemployment.1936 (Philadelphia): Roosevelt once again appeared at the convention. He pushed for a rules change so the nominee needed only a majority of the delegates as opposed to two-thirds.1948 (Philadelphia): Disagreement over the party’s position on civil rights led the Mississippi delegation and part of the Alabama delegation to withdraw from the convention. The departed delegates later met with other Southern Democrats to form the States’ Rights Party and select their own presidential candidate.1964 (Atlantic City, New Jersey): Mississippi’s delegation to the convention consisted of only white delegates since African-Americans were blocked from registering to vote in Mississippi. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party sent an integrated delegation to protest this. Two at-large seats were offered to that delegation as a compromise.1968 (Chicago): Riots raged outside the convention, fueled by anger with President Lyndon Johnson’s Vietnam War strategy and the recent assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. Also this year, a rule change allowed delegations to split their votes among candidates for the first time. 1980 (New York City): A rule up for a vote at the 1980 convention bound delegates to vote for the candidates they were pledged to via primaries and caucuses on the first ballot. However, Sen. Edward Kennedy, who was running for the nomination, tried to prevent this rule from being adopted. When Kennedy’s attempt failed, he removed his name as a potential nominee.1984 (San Francisco): This was the first convention in which superdelegates played a part, making up about 14 percent of the ballots with party leaders and elected officials. The vice presidential pick, Geraldine Ferraro, was the first woman on the ticket of either major party.2008 (Denver): Barack Obama became the first African-American presidential nominee from a major party. 2016 (Philadelphia): Clinton is poised to become the first woman presidential nominee on a major party ticket. We’re about to find out what else is in store for this year.A version of this story was originally published May 21, 2016."

But it was unclear how THC got into the water, as there are no legal marijuana cultivation sites or dispensaries in the area, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue, which regulates the state’s cannabis industry.Captain Michael Yowell of the sheriff’s office said there was evidence that the well was tampered with, and that the FBI and Colorado Bureau of Investigation have joined the probe.The initial screening was done with a “field testing kit,” Yowell told reporters, and the state health department would conduct more through testing. The level of contamination detected was not specified.The Lincoln County health department said in an alert that residents should avoid drinking, cooking or bathing with the town’s water for at least 48 hours.“The contaminated well has been identified and shut down and the lines are being flushed,” the alert said. “Fresh water will be coming into town for the public as soon as possible.”Peter Perrone, a chemist and owner of the state-licensed cannabis testing facility, Gobi Analytical in suburban Denver, said he was skeptical of the reports.“It’s virtually impossible to find THC in water in concentrated levels because cannabinoids are not water soluble,” Perrone told Reuters in a telephone interview.Yowell said he understands that some are questioning how THC could be found in the water, but that does not explain why the tests came up positive for the chemical.“I wouldn’t be doing my job for the community if we just wrote this off,” he said.(Editing by Steve Gorman and Nick Macfie)"

Bernie Sanders attended a Golden State Warriors game during his presidential campaign earlier this year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) praised the NBA on Friday for its decision to move the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte after North Carolina lawmakers failed to repeal a controversial anti-LGBT law.“Great move by the NBA pulling next year’s All-Star Game from NC. We must stand with our LGBTQ brothers and sisters,” the former Democratic presidential candidate tweeted, with an incredible GIF attached.North Carolina lawmakers approved House Bill 2, which has been dubbed the “Bathroom Bill,” in March. The law forces transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they were assigned at birth.The NBA raised concerns about the legislation almost immediately, and Commissioner Adam Silver told the state it could lose the All-Star Game, scheduled for February, if it didn’t change the law. (Charlotte, incidentally, had passed nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people that was invalidated by the new law.)“While we recognize that the NBA cannot choose the law in every city, state, and country in which we do business, we do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by HB2,” the NBA said in a statement Thursday.The state could still lose other major sporting events too: The NCAA approved a new nondiscrimination policy in the wake of HB2’s passage that could affect Greensboro and Charlotte’s status as men’s NCAA Tournament hosts in 2017 and 2018, respectively."

The device made a clicking sound and had a flashing red light. “I’m sitting there and we had just gotten in the van, we were talking and next thing I know, something hits my hand,” NYPD Officer Peter Cybulski later recalled. “I look at it, and I’m like, ‘Boss, it’s a bomb.’” Cybulski’s boss, Sgt. Hameed Armani, was sitting in the driver’s seat and thought both men were about to die. But Armani ― a Muslim immigrant from Afghanistan ― immediately became concerned about the safety of the throngs of people in Times Square.“We both look at each other,” Armani said when he recounted the incident later. “I was like, ‘We’re going to go, but I’m not going to have anybody else go with us.’”The pair decided to keep the device in the van and drive to a less crowded area. Armani said they both “said our prayers” while driving. This could be the end, they thought. “One thing that crossed my mind really quick was my daughter,” Armani said. “She’s 12 years old, she watches TV now, she understands the news, so every time I leave home, she says, ‘Dad, promise you’re gonna come home.’”About a block away, Cybulski and Armani found an area with fewer people. They removed the item from their van and placed it on the sidewalk. The police department later determined that the the device was not a bomb. Everyone was safe.New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton called Cybulski and Armani “heroes of this department, heroes of this city” during a press conference on Thursday. “They put their own lives at risk so that they could save potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of people in Times Square,” Bratton said.In a Facebook post that same day, the NYPD Muslim Officers Society wrote, “Can you please inform Donald J. Trump and others against ‪#‎Immigrants‬ &‪#‎Muslims‬ about this ‪#‎Heroic‬ ‪#‎NYPD‬ officer of ‪#‎Muslim‬ ‪#‎Afghan‬ roots (our proud member) and his partner.”According to the group’s website, Armani is among nearly 1,000 members of the NYPD Muslim Officers Society, some of whom are immigrants like him. Similarly, there are an estimated 6,000 Muslims serving in the U.S. military, including many immigrants. Take Hanif Sanghi, for example. Sanghi joined the U.S. Army after emigrating from Pakistan. He served in combat in Afghanistan and earned a Bronze Star. Or consider the story of Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan. Born in New Jersey to Muslim immigrant parents, Khan joined the Army and was killed in Iraq in 2007. The stories of these immigrants and their families offer a sharp rebuke to Trump’s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S., as well as to those who have called for a ban on Syrian refugees coming to their states. With those kind of bans, what other heroes might the U.S. miss out on? Armani told reporters Thursday that he immigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan so his daughter could have a better life, and so that he could be a police officer. He has been a police officer for 10 years. Police identified the man believed to have thrown the device into the police van as 52-year-old Hector Meneses. He was arrested Thursday after a long standoff in Columbus Circle, during which Meneses threatened to blow himself up. No explosives were found in his car. Meneses faces charges that include placing a false bomb, making a terroristic threat and criminal possession of a weapon."

John Kasich in the GOP primary, envisioned the gathering as a kickoff of the post-Trump recovery that he is sure will take place regardless of whether Trump is elected.“Whatever happens in this election, there is going to be a process of rebuilding ― either the existing party or thinking of a new party going forward,” Weinstein said. “This group will be part of that process.”Weinstein plans to vote for presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November. While he disagrees with her policies, he believes that, unlike Trump, she is qualified to hold the office.Scheve, on the other hand, voted for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the GOP primary. Scheve is unsure of his plan for November, but ​may​ vote for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson or write in Ronald Reagan as a protest vote.A common theme among the “mourners” was their disdain for Trump’s racially divisive rhetoric, lack of concrete policy convictions and disrespect for longstanding political norms and civic institutions.A government affairs professional, who asked not to be named for work-related reasons, said Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim entry into the United States and commitment to deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants prevented him from backing the Republican nominee.“His policies bring out the worst in the American people by dividing us and sowing the seeds of suspicion and animus based on people’s religion and ethnicity,” he said.The quintessentially Washingtonian get-together took place just a night after Cruz rocked the political world by refusing to endorse Trump in his speech at the Republican National Convention. While Cruz’s remarks may have won him few friends at the convention in Cleveland, including in the delegation from his home state of Texas, those at the wake on Thursday had only praise for him.Cruz’s “speech was perfect,” Scheve said. He denied that it was a snub in any way to Trump. “When I was on the Hill, leadership said all the time to members, ‘Vote your conscience,’” he said. “When did that become a bad thing?”“I have not heard a ton of Ted Cruz speeches I like and I think he is a generally unlikable person,” Weinstein said. “But last night was remarkable.”Cameron Kilberg served on the legal team for Arizona Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign and was most recently a policy adviser for the presidential campaign of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.Kilberg still respects Christie, but she was “sad to see” he decided to support Trump. “I’m all for security and immigration reform. Every which way [Trump] has gone about this is not gonna help us,” she said. “Turning our back on NATO is not gonna help us.”Notwithstanding her presence at the wake, Kilberg is not as despondent about the prospects of the Republican Party.“It’s all good fun and jest,” Kilberg said of the wake. “But I think the party is not over, and there is a way to reorganize and regroup.”"

He denied that it was a snub in any way to Trump. “When I was on the Hill, leadership said all the time to members, ‘Vote your conscience,’” he said. “When did that become a bad thing?”“I have not heard a ton of Ted Cruz speeches I like and I think he is a generally unlikable person,” Weinstein said. “But last night was remarkable.”Cameron Kilberg served on the legal team for Arizona Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign and was most recently a policy adviser for the presidential campaign of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.Kilberg still respects Christie, but she was “sad to see” he decided to support Trump. “I’m all for security and immigration reform. Every which way [Trump] has gone about this is not gonna help us,” she said. “Turning our back on NATO is not gonna help us.”Notwithstanding her presence at the wake, Kilberg is not as despondent about the prospects of the Republican Party.“It’s all good fun and jest,” Kilberg said of the wake. “But I think the party is not over, and there is a way to reorganize and regroup.”"

It’s a small sum compared to the multibillion dollar value of Fox News ― which Ailes is largely responsible for building. Still, when a company ousts a guy for sexual harassment, but pays him handsomely to go, it’s not sending the clearest of messages to its employees or the outside world. Resentment may follow or a feeling that certain behavior may still be tolerated.“While we are glad to see Roger Ailes step down from his position at Fox News, sending him off with zero accountability and a big check is a slap in the face to the ... women he harassed during his tenure as CEO and does nothing to fundamentally change the culture of Fox News that he created,” Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of UltraViolet, a national women’s advocacy organization, said in a statement.The fact that Ailes is getting such a big pay package is not only about the privilege and even-handedness accorded to men who are accused of sexual discrimination, it’s also yet another sign of the ever-growing gulf between the CEO class and everyone else.There could be more financial pain to come, though. Ailes still is facing a lawsuit filed a little more than two weeks ago by former Fox and Friends host Gretchen Carlson. She accused him of sexually propositioning her and then basically firing her after she rejected him. The case prompted Fox News’ parent company, 21st Century Fox, to launch an internal investigation, which reportedly turned up at least 10 other women who had similar issues with Ailes.Most damning: Fox News superstar Megyn Kelly told investigators that she had declined Ailes’ advances early on in her tenure at Fox and had feared the consequences, the New York Times reports.Ailes has repeatedly denied all the allegations, but on Thursday, under pressure, he resigned his post and walked away with that reportedly large severance ― most of which is a payout of what’s left in his contract.Paying CEOs millions for leaving ― even in disgrace, even if they were fired ― is standard operating procedure in corporate America, where CEOs earn 276 times the average employee.Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer stands to make $55 million if she loses her job.

Rupert Murdoch, the 85-year-old mogul who hired Ailes 20 years ago to run Fox News, spoke glowingly of Ailes, who will reportedly continue to advise Murdoch in the days and weeks ahead.“Roger Ailes has made a remarkable contribution to our company and our country,” Rupert Murdoch said in a press release Thursday. “Roger shared my vision of a great and independent television organization and executed it brilliantly over 20 great years.”“I am absolutely heartbroken that all this happened. I love the guy, and loved working for him,” Fox News host Brit Hume told reporters at the Republican National Convention that same day.A statement from Murdoch’s sons, who now run 21st Century Fox, hinted only obliquely at the fact that the company would no longer tolerate that “loutish” behavior. “We continue our commitment to maintaining a work environment based on trust and respect,” Lachlan and James said. “We take seriously our responsibility to uphold these traditional, long-standing values of our company.”Their statement comes at the bottom of a press release, which generally praised Ailes. Pretty weak tea, if the company wants to project itself as a modern workplace that is welcoming to women and respectful to all. If Fox truly wants to demonstrate a level of respect for its employees, company leadership might want to make some part of its internal investigation public or consider opening up more about how it will change the culture now that Ailes has left the building.

Alvarez and Murray Bartlett, however, “Looking: The Movie” represents more than just a fond farewell to the series, which struggled to find an audience during its brief, two-season run despite critical acclaim. It was an opportunity to reunite with a cast and creative team they fondly refer to as a “family” for a full-length project with director Andrew Haigh, whose 2015 film, “45 Years,” became an awards season darling.“We got the call that the show was canceled, and it was the same call that we got the information about the movie. It was a bittersweet feeling,” Alvarez told The Huffington Post. “More often than not, these shows get canceled, and there’s no sense of closure for the characters. But there’s also no sense of closure for us as actors, for the family we created. To close it out [by] making an original Andrew Haigh film was just perfect. It was a blessing.”The movie, which airs on HBO this Saturday, picks up a year after the series left off. Romantically challenged techie Patrick (Jonathan Groff) returns to San Francisco after fleeing the city a year earlier when his relationship with boss Kevin (Russell Tovey) went south. Back on the West coast, Patrick finds that the lives of his best pals have evolved in surprising ways. Tortured artist Agustín (Alvarez) is gainfully employed and crazy in love with adorable bear Eddie (Daniel Franzese). Meanwhile, Dom (Bartlett) has fulfilled his long-held dream of opening a restaurant, but his love life is at a standstill. Then, of course, there’s Richie (Raúl Castillo), the salt-of-the-earth, Mexican-born barber for whom Patrick may or may not still harbor unresolved feelings. As those plot points suggest, “Looking: The Movie” perfectly maintains the graceful, slice-of-life tone that polarized TV viewers, some of whom were expecting a gay take on “Girls” or “Sex and the City,” during the series’ brief run. Those who didn’t embrace the show’s emphasis on individual relationships over large-scale melodrama may still not be won over, but for Bartlett, the movie’s 90-minute running time takes “the strengths of the show and really showcases them.”Of course, the series was subjected to more than its share of online criticism from many in the LGBT community, too, with some arguing that they didn’t see their own lives represented in the show’s central trio who were, by some accounts, “too gay,” or even worse, “boring.” (SPOILER ALERT: as Doris, perennial scene-stealer Lauren Weedman silences those criticisms with a line that’s easily one of the film’s most memorable)Although he and Alvarez said they weren’t fully prepared for the online vitriol, Bartlett now feels that the strong reactions “made sense” in hindsight.“The responses were surprising in a way, because we all loved the show so much and believed in the show so much and were just planning it, moment-by-moment, and going for honesty,” he said. “There’s a lot of pressure on a show representing a specific community from that community to represent every aspect of the community, and there’s especially a lot of pressure when that community is rarely represented in the media. But I think it sparked a lot of really great conversations within the gay community about how we want to be represented and what the representations out there are. In that way, the show was really healthy in the bigger picture.”Ultimately, the climax of “Looking: The Movie” hinges on whether or not Patrick and his friends will skip off into the California sunset having found true love and happiness. To that point, it presents an ending for the show’s central trio that’s certain to give some viewers the warm fuzzies. Whether or not it’s a satisfying one is open to interpretation – an unconventional, non-Hollywood choice that, according to Alvarez and Bartlett, is exactly what creator Michael Lannan and Haigh were going for. As far as the show’s legacy is concerned, Alvarez hopes that “Looking” moved the cultural needle at least a bit in terms of helping audiences view LGBT-specific programming as something other than just niche TV.“I’ve had a few, conservative straight friends who watched the pilot, and they were like, ‘This isn’t for me, but I’ll watch the second one and the third one.’ The power of storytelling opened up their point of view,” he said. “My hope is that we can have shows with LGBT at the forefront that speak to a larger community, and that people will see themselves in those characters. That, hopefully, is the testament we leave behind.”“Looking: The Movie” airs on HBO July 23. Check out the trailer above. "

21,POLITICS,Ivanka Trump Says Her Dad Will Fight For Equal Pay And Child Care.

Some say the successful businesswoman stole the show on the Republican National Convention's final night, thanks in part to her comments on women in the workplace, the struggle for equal pay and the need for more affordable child care.But if her father really cared about that stuff, one would think he would have worked some of it into his presidential campaign over the previous 13 months. And even if he did make it a new priority as president, his own party has stood in the way of updating Depression-era labor laws, devoting more taxpayer dollars toward child care and putting new equal-pay regulations on employers. Take equal pay ― this issue is an inevitable one in a modern presidential campaign, and Trump has had to face it down a few times. When he was asked about it on “Morning Joe” last year, Trump did say that he believes women deserve equal pay for doing the same job as men. But he shied away from offering any policy prescriptions that would address the issue. “If they do the same job they should get the same pay,” Trump said. “But it’s very hard to say what’s the same job. It’s very tricky.” In Trumpian fashion, he added, “These are one of those things we have to look at very strongly.”Then there was the confrontation with the woman at a town hall in New Hampshire in October. According to Fusion, the woman was an intern for Jeb Bush, one of Trump’s primary opponents. She asked, if Trump were president, “Will a woman make the same as a man and will I get to choose what I do with my body?”“You’re gonna make the same if you do as good a job,” Trump countered. “And I happen to be pro-life. OK?”Doesn’t exactly sound like a champion for equal pay laws. So how about child care?On Thursday night, his daughter noted that single women without children tend to significantly out-earn mothers in the workplace, saying “motherhood” is “creating the greatest wage discrepancy in this country.” Trump, she said, “will focus on making quality child care affordable and accessible for all.” Her father had a great opportunity to address this very question at an event in December. A woman with the group Make It Work asked for his thoughts on child care.His response?“It’s a big subject, darling.”At another event, Trump expanded his thoughts on the matter. As HuffPost's Emily Peck noted, Trump suggested the free market would take care of it, saying it's already very easy for companies to provide affordable child care.“It’s not expensive for a company to do it,” he said. “You need one person or two people, and you need some blocks and you need some swings and some toys… I do it all over, and I get great people because of it… It’s something that can be done, I think, very easily by a company.”What’s notable about Trump’s candid remarks on the campaign trail is how much they contradict his daughter’s pronouncements from the RNC stage. She specifically said Trump will fight to change laws in order to address these problems for working women. “As President, my father will change the labor laws that were put into place at a time when women were not a significant portion of the workforce,” she said.But her father has given no indication at all that he’s eager to do that. What he has said when he’s being candid is that businesses will take care of this stuff on their own. If a woman deserves equal pay, she’ll get it if she’s worth it. If she needs child care to have a decent career, then her company will provide it, because it’s not hard to do. OK?Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Bruce Rauner called half of Chicago teachers ""virtually illiterate"" in 2011.",2016-07-22,"Gov. Bruce Rauner speaks to reporters about the state budget and education funding on June 27, 2016. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Chicago teachers are most definitely not illiterate, and they want their governor to know it.Emails released this week by The Chicago Tribune reveal that Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) called half of Chicago Public School teachers “virtually illiterate” in 2011, before he was governor. He apologized for the email during a press conference Friday, calling it “inaccurate and intemperate.”When Rauner sent the email he was an executive at a private equity group that was involved with the Chicago Public Education Fund, a philanthropic education reform nonprofit that invests in local school initiatives. Rauner sent the email to several of the Fund’s wealthy leaders to advocate for a strong teacher evaluation system in the district. It was released after the Chicago Tribune sued for access to emails regarding a scandal involving Chicago Public Schools.Per the Chicago Tribune, the email read:“Teacher evaluation is critically important, but in a massive bureaucracy with a hostile union, where 50% of principals are managerially incompetent and half of teachers are virtually illiterate, a complete multi-dimensional evaluation system with huge subjectivity in it will be attacked, manipulated and marginalized — the status quo will prevail,” Rauner wrote.In response, teachers have started a “teachers read” hashtag, detailing their reading selections. Rauner’s Friday mea culpa was preceded by the governor’s spokesperson Lance Trover releasing a statement Thursday apologizing, saying that the email was “sent out of frustration at the pace of change in our public school system.”“Significant change can be frustratingly slow; this is especially true in public education. Many of us, at one time or another, have sent hastily crafted emails containing inaccurate or intemperate statements,” the statement said, according to DNAinfo. “The Governor regrets writing it and apologizes to CPS educators for making an unfair, untrue comment.”Public education leaders in the city and state are deeply angered by the governor’s remarks. President of the Illinois Federation of Teachers, Dan Montgomery, called the governor’s words “a grotesque affront to the thousands of dedicated, hardworking, and talented educators and, indeed, the children who learn from them and love them,” reported DNAinfo.Here’s how #TeachersRead is taking off on Twitter: "
23,POLITICS,Peter Thiel Tells GOP Convention: 'I Am Proud To Be Gay',Amanda Terkel and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-rnc_us_57916155e4b0bdddc4d3edcf,"""I don’t pretend to agree with every plank in our party’s platform. But fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline,"" the billionaire said.",2016-07-22,Silicon Valley entrepreneur Peter Thiel is the first GOP convention speaker to talk about being gay.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57918a3c2400002700b3273f.jpeg?cache=KFdiz23KJs&ops=crop_0_122_3769_2247%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― Peter Thiel on Thursday became the first openly gay Republican convention speaker in history to talk about his sexual orientation, and said he disagreed with portions of his party’s platform that restrict rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.“I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all I am proud to be an American,” said the Silicon Valley billionaire, who co-founded PayPal.“When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union. And we won. Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom,” Thiel added, referring to conservatives’ push to block transgender individuals from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. “This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?”Three gay members of the California delegation went to the front row of their section, directly in front of the stage, to watch Thiel’s speech ― a gesture of both solidarity and advocacy.Most of Thiel’s remarks focused on non-LGBT issues, primarily national security and the economy. But his pro-equality message ― even with its very light criticism of GOP policies ― was still notable at this convention. After all, this week, the Republican Party adopted one of its most anti-LGBT platforms in history. It advocates going back to legally defining marriage as between one man and one woman. It supports adoption agencies that refuse to serve same-sex couples; affirms so-called conversion therapy, a discredited practice of trying to turn gay people into straight people; calls for banning transgender people from using bathrooms that match their gender identity and endorses controversial legislation that would allow taxpayer-funded discrimination against same-sex married couples in the name of religious freedom.And the Republican Party’s vice presidential candidate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has spent his career pushing a socially conservative agenda ― including going after LGBT equality. “I don’t pretend to agree with every plank in our party’s platform,” Thiel said. “But fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline.”There are indications that many rank-and-file voters agree with Thiel. The vast majority of convention-goers who spoke to The Huffington Post this week either said they wished the anti-LGBT language wasn’t in the platform or that it was a non-issue to them.Even many who said they support traditional marriage were confused about why their party continues to focus on it when there are more pressing problems. Thiel also urged his party to focus more on areas like national security. Rachel Hoff, a D.C. delegate and the first openly gay member of the platform committee, said she thought Thiel’s speech was great.“In a year like this, when LGBT issues are at the forefront of society ― and in particular here in our party ― it’s significant even that he was given the opportunity to speak, and it’s especially significant that he talked directly about being gay. I think the response from the floor was incredibly encouraging,” Hoff said. “He did address the platform directly, and I think he’s a good representation of the fact that our platform doesn’t represent all Republicans.”A new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds that only 37 percent of Republican respondents would like to see a president who opposes gay marriage. Forty-four percent don’t care, and 13 percent would actually prefer to see their party’s stance on the issue shift. Thiel is not the first openly gay speaker at a GOP convention. The first came in 1996. The second and most memorable came in 2000, when then-Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.) took the stage. Though Kolbe spoke only of trade policy, his homosexuality created a stir in the room. Members of the Texas delegation bowed their heads in prayer as he took the podium. It was an ugly affair.Thiel received no similar treatment. His line about being a proudly gay Republican received unremarkable though clearly supportive applause ― the biggest coming from his own California delegation. Even the Texans sitting in the back seemed to find nothing objectionable about the historic moment.“To me, there is no issue. This is an open tent party, and we welcome everyone to come into the Republican Party,” said Ken Cope, a national delegate from Texas.“I’m a Christian and I don’t condone homosexuality,” said Denise McNamara, also of Texas. “But everyone is a sinner. So I don’t think we can condemn people because all of us are sinners. You have to hate the sin and love the sinner.”Thiel’s support for Trump is an outlier in both the LGBT and tech communities, which lean heavily Democratic. And many gay activists were less than thrilled with Thiel’s remarks: Trump himself opposes marriage equality. He initially came out in favor of allowing transgender people to use the bathroom corresponding to their gender identity rather than the gender assigned to them at birth, but he has since said he supports North Carolina’s law barring them from doing so. This post has been updated with reaction to Thiel’s speech.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

His group was one of several ""eco-right"" organizations represented in Cleveland.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579231b92400002600b3285c.jpeg?cache=VVGQbBWKOu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― Alex Bozmoski brought a lot of Theodore Roosevelt masks to hand out at the Republican National Convention ― 4,500 cardboard outlines of the 26th president’s mustache and round spectacles, topped with the outline of a slouch hat.Bozmoski’s goal was to “paint the town Teddy” and remind fellow conservatives about the deep roots conservation has in the Republican Party. Roosevelt is often credited with planting the notion as he expanded the national park system and inspired Americans to reflect on the importance of the environment.The 30-year-old Bozmoski is the director of strategy and operations at RepublicEn, a conservative group that bills itself as “energy optimists and climate realists.” Former Rep. Bob Inglis (R-S.C.), who advocated for climate solutions before he was bounced out of office by a tea party primary challenger in 2010, founded the group in 2014.But Bozmoski had a hard time getting the Teddy masks to take off. “Two people asked me if this was Robin Williams from Night At the Museum,” he said Monday at a Bloomberg Media event.The event brought together members of the emerging “eco-right” movement, including representatives from the Young Evangelicals for Climate Action, ConservAmerica, the Christian Coalition and Young Conservatives for Energy Reform. This small group of convention attendees wanted to talk about climate change ― even as the party and its nominee actively spurn the issue.The conservative conservationists offered a number of reasons the GOP should care about climate change, from national security concerns and the potential for developing lucrative clean technologies, to the belief that caring for the planet is a religious imperative.Among the attendees, there were differences about whether to address “climate change” directly with their fellow conservatives ― or to skip the problem entirely and just talk about solutions. “Climate change has taken such a far, left-wing feel,” said Angel Garcia of Young Conservatives for Energy Reform. While he’s not sure they will ever get the right fully on board with the idea that climate change is a real threat, they can align on energy independence and national security, he said. They were universally frustrated that the left has dominated the policy discussion on this issue, in the absence of a visible environmental right.“We have the answers,” said ConservAmerica president Rob Sisson. “We need to start talking about it, remove that shyness.”But that sentiment didn’t find the most receptive crowd in Cleveland.By Wednesday, Bozmoski had all but abandoned the ambition of turning the town Teddy. “I got tired real quick of trying to sell people,” he said. “Now I think our ambition is to try to make as many people aware as possible that there is a home for eco-right conservatives.” Bozmoski, who is personally in the Never Trump camp and plans to support Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, acknowledged that they probably faced a tough crowd with the Teddy masks. Just look at the Republican Party platform, which calls for selling off public lands, declares coal “clean” and ignores climate change, or at Donald Trump, who has said climate change is hoax invented by China.“That is all a little bit nuts… a lot of bit nuts. We’re handing out Teddy faces at a convention for the party that nominated and elected Teddy Roosevelt… And the convention is saying they want to freaking sell all the parks that he started for us,” he said.“There’s an irony to the Teddy face that really makes me angry.” By Thursday afternoon, he still had 3,300 Teddy masks. But he said he’s considering it a victory anyway ― even if his group didn’t give all of them away, they connected with several hundred people who were happy to see them at the RNC.“It’s not trending big, but we’re finding the diamonds in the rough,” he said. “It’s our way of putting a big banner around our face that says if you’re different and you’re ready to lead, help us rebuild our party after this train wreck is over.” "
25,POLITICS,Donald Trump Tries To Trick Americans Into Believing Crime Is Spiking,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-crime-stats_us_579153cae4b00c9876ced6e8,The GOP nominee is spelling out a massive role for the federal government in local policing.,2016-07-22,Donald Trump's crime statistics don't tell the whole story.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579154232400002600b32702.jpeg?cache=7aAU3CoBua&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― Donald Trump painted a portrait of a nation in “crisis” where crime is spinning out of control thanks to President Barack Obama, when the business mogul accepted the Republican presidential nomination Thursday. As Trump spoke, he deemed himself the “law and order” president ― and promised that “crime and violence” would “come to an end” once he becomes president ― all the while probably hoping Americans won’t look at the facts. Bucking his party, he also sketched out a broad (but unspecific) role for the federal government in local law enforcement.Here’s a breakdown of some of what Trump said about crime at the Quicken Loans Arena on Thursday evening, compared with the facts.“Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement,” Trump said. Trump is right that it took decades to bring down crime rates to their current level. But during the Obama administration, the violent crime rate has continued to decline, according to the latest final available FBI data. While preliminary data from the first half of 2015 showed a slight bump in violent crimes in the first six months of 2015 compared with the first half of 2014, it’s important to remember that violent crime was at record lows in 2014, and final data from all of 2015 is not yet available. But so far, every full year Obama has been in office has been safer than any year under President George W. Bush, just as crime was down in the Bush years compared to the Bill Clinton presidential years. Trump pointed to statistics that show homicides increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities in 2015 compared to the historic lows in 2014, but it is too early to really determine any one reason for that spike. Trump said Americans have “seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities,” which can also be attributed to the rise in smart phones and social media rather than any actual massive spike in violent crime. He also claimed that “safety will be restored” after he becomes president, but didn’t explain how that would happen, given that violent crime is often a concern for state and local law enforcement, who work with federal law enforcement officials. Killings in Washington, D.C., were up 50 percent, Trump claimed. That was true from 2014 to 2015. However, data shows that the year-to-date murders are currently down ― there were 77 murders at this point in 2015 compared with 70 murders at this point in 2016. Trump also claimed that the number of officers killed in the line of duty is up by almost 50 percent over this point last year. While the number of law enforcement officers killed this year is certainly troubling, 2015 was one of the safest years for police officers in recorded history. The low number of officers killed feloniously each year ― 41 in 2015, for example ― makes the percentages somewhat misleading.Rob Smith, director of Harvard Law’s Fair Punishment Project, pointed out that the real threat to Americans isn’t homicide.“Americans are 50 times more likely to die from heart disease or cancer, and three times more likely to die in a car accident, than from a firearm assault,” Smith told HuffPost. “Being a police officer in America ups the risk a bit, but that doesn’t mean you should enlist in Trump’s War on Cops. You’d be better off scrambling the bombers to stop the War on Roofers, a profession far more deadly ― but, of course, still not particularly deadly at all ― than policing.” This article was updated to reflect Trump’s remarks instead of his draft speech and to include comments from Rob Smith.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Andrew Cuomo (D) signed a bill Thursday ending the “tampon tax” in his state, which means menstrual products are now exempt from the state’s 4 percent sales tax. It will save women in New York an estimated $10 million a year.“This is a regressive tax on essential products that women have had to pay for far too long and lifting it is a matter of social and economic justice,” Cuomo said in a statement.The law is set to go into effect in September.States can only tax citizens on items that are deemed nonessential ― groceries, medical supplies and clothing are common items exempt from sales tax. But in the vast majority of states, feminine hygiene products don’t fall under that umbrella, even though the FDA has labeled them as “medical devices.”Currently, six states, including Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maryland and now New York, do not tax menstrual products like tampons and pads. Other states ― like Alaska, Oregon, Montana, New Hampshire and Delaware ― don’t have sales tax at all. In January, an interview between YouTuber Ingrid Nilsen and President Barack Obama helped kickstart a national conversation about the tampon tax and why menstrual products are viewed as nonessential.“I have to tell you, I have no idea why states would tax these as luxury items,” Obama said. “I suspect it’s because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed.”Over the past year, lawmakers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Utah, Ohio, California, Michigan and Connecticut have all proposed legislation to end the tax, but they have received mixed responses. Critics argue that states could lose necessary tax revenue if the legislation passes. Others say the tax women pay on tampons isn’t substantial enough to justify changing the law.And women aren’t paying too much for just tampons and pads. Companies take unisex products like razors, lighters ― or even pens ― and “shrink it and pink it” in order to market them to women at an inflated cost. That cost gap is commonly known as the “pink tax.” In 2012, Ellen DeGeneres bashed Bic on her show for creating special pens “for her” that featured special grips in purple or pink for those willing to pay a little extra. The YouTube video of the fake commercial she created for the product has over 6 million views, and is one example of how women are shedding light on unnecessarily gendered products."

I’m 100 percent certain how Russian President Putin feels – he’s a very happy man,” he said.Trump’s comments in a New York Times interview “would seem to put him on the same page with Mr. Putin,” Richard Armitage, who was deputy secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration, said in an interview with Reuters.In the New York Times interview, Trump, in response to a question about potential Russian aggression toward the Baltic states - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - said that if Moscow attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing whether those nations “have fulfilled their obligations to us.” He added, “If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes.”“It’s the end of NATO,” Robert Hunter, a former U.S. ambassador to the alliance under President Bill Clinton, told Reuters. “The essence of NATO, more than any other single factor, is the commitment of the United States of America to the security of the other 27 members.”Asked about Trump’s comments, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the EU knows it needs to “work more on our defense capabilities,” but said the United States needs to keep solidarity with its allies.“It’s very simple to realize that in the world of today, which is quite a complicated one and quite a dangerous one, you need friends,” said Mogherini, who spoke in Washington at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“INFLAMMATORY REMARKS”A letter signed by a bipartisan group of 39 national security experts said Trump’s “inflammatory remarks” do not represent the interests of the United States.“The strength of our alliances is at the core of those interests,” said the group, which includes prominent Republicans such as former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and former State Department official Eliot Cohen.The United States must uphold the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s commitments “to all of our allies, including Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,” the letter said.U.S. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the mutual defense commitment was the essence of the Atlantic alliance.But he added that both Republicans and Democrats “are becoming exasperated that most members of the alliance are not honoring their obligations” for military spending, Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said in a statement.Responding to Trump’s suggestion that his decisions would depend in part on whether states that were attacked were meeting their financial commitments to the alliance, former diplomat Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said it is important not to see NATO or any alliance solely in budget terms.“More important is the net benefit the U.S. derives from the stability and security of the country and region affected and the price the U.S. would pay if stability were to be lost or its interests undermined,” Haass told Reuters.Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which created NATO in 1949 and calls an attack on one member an attack on all, has been invoked once - to help defend the United States after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.Following the attacks, NATO sent AWACS planes to patrol over U.S. skies, with more than 800 crew members from 13 NATO countries flying over 360 sorties. As part of the eight measures approved to support the United States, NATO, about three weeks later, sent elements of its Standing Naval Forces to patrol the Eastern Mediterranean and monitor shipping, expanding that to include the entire Mediterranean several months later.A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also noted that the alliance “deployed a third of the troops in Afghanistan for over a decade, where over one thousand soldiers from non-U.S. NATO allies and partners gave their lives.”Still, some experts downplayed Trump’s comments, even as they criticized them.Kurt Volker, who was U.S. ambassador to NATO under both Republican President George W. Bush and Democratic President Barack Obama, said it was inadvisable to create doubts in adversaries’ minds about the consequences they would face if they invaded a country.“Putin loves it,” Volker said.But he said the general European attitude was to take Trump’s pronouncements with a grain of salt. “Everyone knows it’s an election campaign,” he said.(Additional reporting by Jonathan Landay, Yara Bayoumy, Warren Strobel, Roberta Rampton and Doina Chiacu in Washington and Emily Stephenson and Ginger Gibson in Cleveland; Editing by Leslie Adler and Jonathan Oatis)"

Data mining every single person in this room for information as to what you’re buying, what you like — above all, your behavior.”Niantic, the company behind the smash-hit app that uses GPS for its augmented reality experience, has already admitted to some security issues surrounding the Google accounts of iOS users. The company made a fix and assured users the app only accesses “basic Google profile information (specifically, your User ID and email address).” But Stone, who is promoting his upcoming film “Snowden” about the NSA leaker, is not a fan and thinks such technology could lead to a “robot society.” “It’s everywhere. It’s what some people call surveillance capitalism ... You’ll see a new form of, frankly, a robot society where they will know how you want to behave, and they will make the mock-up that matches how you behave. It’s what they call totalitarianism.”Zachary Quinto, who co-stars in the film, had a less dramatic take on the issue.“I tried to make light of it. He went a little bit more to the real heart of the matter, which I think is a really relevant point that he made,” he told ABC’s WZZM. “I think it’s great that people are engaging with one another, but I feel like the ultimate goal for us is to be able to do that without these devices in our hands.” "
