Even in this well protected reserve, where rangers follow shoot-to-kill orders, poachers are laying siege to ￂﾓFortress Kaziranga,ￂﾔ attempting to sheer off the animals' horns to supply a surge in demand for purported medicine in China that's pricier than gold.

While parks in the U.S. are nice enough, pack a little international travel into your ranger dreams by heading farther than Mount Rushmore, like the Sahara, or the Outback. Rubbing elbows with Smokey the Bear outside the U.S. will take some preparation and hard work, but the payoff can be well worth the effort.Before You ApplyFor the extreme outdoor enthusiast, being a park ranger might seem all unicorns-and-cupcakes, but in reality, the job can be more about shoveling bear shit and fighting with drunken dickheads who insist that burning plastic is hilarious. Keep in mind that if you want to get to a point where you can get paid (very little) to play outside, you will first have to clock in some bitch-work hours. Overall, no matter which country you want to park it in, plan on studying something relevant like park management, zoology or botany before or during your stay. You may also have to volunteer to get your foot in the (out)door.Playing in Aussie ParksPark Victoria is responsible for managing hundreds of killer national, state and metropolitan parks as well as thousands of conservation reserves in Victoria, Australia. Non-citizens can only become park rangers in the land down under if they have a valid, working visa. Plan on hitting the books hard in Natural Resource Management and Recreation/Tourism to be considered. The Summer Ranger Program offers a limited number of short-term ranger jobs for students and is a great ""in"" to the Aussie park system.African RangeIf you feel like parks are for slides and sissies, you might want to consider heading to Africa to become a safari ranger. Learn how to track wild animals and survive in the bush while dodging the bullets of poachers. Outside of the zoology courses and personal training sessions you will want to complete beforehand, enroll in a Safari Ranger School to get a thorough training about ranger life in the African wild. Those afraid of snakes, rhinos or physical exertion need not apply.Volunteer Rangers in ColombiaColombia has a wide array of parks scattered around the country. Some parks contain glaciers and beaches, others are more like full-on leafy forests. The scenery here should hit that nature g-spot for any aspiring ranger. To apply for the volunteer ranger program you'll need to present some basic documents like a passport, certification that you're healthy and not crazy, and get a couple of precautionary vaccines and photos. The program runs a five-day training period, after which you will be assigned to your park of choice and given free lodging and in-park transportation. You'll have to pay for your meals, but if you study up, perhaps foraging something edible will be in the cards.Rangers Without BordersSeems like you can make just about everything a ""without borders"" organization these days (doctors, teachers, post-Burning Man burners). A division of the International Rangers Federation, Rangers Without Borders is a program currently in development that will aim to link up rangers around the world with those working in developing countries to provide them with support. If you get really serious about ranger-ing (i.e. invest in pair of too-short khakis), keep your eye on this program; it'll be useful when you've petted one rabid squirrel too many.Written By: Sara White"
1,DIVORCE,PTSD After Divorce,"Lisa Arends, Contributor
Author, wellness coach, and math teacher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ptsd-after-divorce_us_5b9cbd0de4b03a1dcc815f99,"When my husband left, I trembled for a year. That's not just some figurative language used to convey emotion; I literally shook. For a year.",2013-01-30,Scared woman sitting on floor with windows grid shadows.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cbd0d2500003600362fc6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When my husband left, I trembled for a year. That's not just some figurative language used to convey emotion; I literally shook. For a year. My body quaked from the aftershocks of the sudden trauma, my legs constantly kicking and my hands quivering. Those weren't my only symptoms, either. I had flashbacks and nightmares that took me back to the to the day where I received the text that ended my marriage. The 21-word incoming message read: ""I am sorry to be such a coward leaving you this way but I am leaving you and leaving the state."" From then on, the sound of an incoming message would actually send me to the floor, where I braced myself for another digital attack. I felt numb and had trouble remembering aspects of my marriage or my husband. I avoided sights and sounds that were associated with my marriage, often driving well out of my way to steer clear of my old neighborhood. I couldn't sleep; I was hyper alert, always scanning every room and ready to fight or flee at any moment. I could not eat and my weight fell to dangerous levels. As far as I know, my life was never in actual danger. But apparently my mind and body never received that message. In an instant, the person I trusted the most became someone whom I feared. I felt threatened and unsafe. I didn't know what was real and who to trust. My husband never forced himself upon me, but I felt as though I had been violated when I learned I had been sleeping with the enemy. He never physically hit me, but the psychological blows left scars just the same. I've never been to war, yet every interaction with his lawyer was a battle that left me paralyzed with fear for my ability to survive. I by no means intend to trivialize the horrors endured by those who have been the victims of abuse or those have been through war. Those are traumas on a scale well above what I have endured. What I have come to realize, however, is that trauma can come in many forms and in many degrees. The psychiatrist I saw that first year after my divorce stopped short of diagnosing me with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), but the term came up as I described my symptoms, and the medications she prescribed are frequently used in the treatment of PTSD. Another therapist I saw also mentioned the disorder and used complimentary strategies. PTSD happens when your mind cannot process the extent of the trauma. It's like a short circuit in your nervous system, where you have trouble distinguishing between real and perceived threats. We tend to think of PTSD as occurring only in life-threatening situations, but it can occur anytime there is an acute or prolonged trauma. Not all divorces lead to PTSD, but if it is sudden or abusive, the trauma can be severe and sudden enough to lead to PTSD-like symptoms.According to The National Institute of Mental Health, PTSD includes flashbacks, bad dreams, staying away from triggers, feeling emotionally numb, feeling guilty, having trouble with memory, being easily startled, feeling tense and angry. Additionally, the diagnosis of PTSD requires that the symptoms persist beyond 30 days and that they interfere with daily life. There is a difference between normal grief, shock and anxiety and the pathology of PTSD. PTSD occurs when a perfect storm of conditions are met. First, prior traumas can ""prime"" someone for PTSD as the stress can actually cause epigenetic changes, rewiring the body to be extra sensitive to further trauma. Women are also more likely to experience PTSD, possibly due to heightened fear conditioning. PTSD is also more likely to occur when traumas accumulate. When someone who has some of these risk factors undergoes a divorce, particularly one that is sudden or especially toxic, PTSD-like symptoms can occur. Sudden abandonment or attack by a loved one can trigger panic and disorientation as real as any physical threat. During my divorce, I learned that most people assumed that depression would be the disorder de jour after a break up. They expected me to be sad and withdrawn, curled up on my bed with a box of tissues and endless pints of ice cream. Instead, I was hyper vigilant and always on the lookout for the next blow. It's important to realize that all divorces are not the same and we all respond differently. There is no ""right"" way to be after a divorce. I was embarrassed for a time to reveal the true nature of my symptoms. I felt like I wasn't permitted to feel that way since I didn't have a knife to my throat. I felt ashamed that I couldn't cope with the basics of eating and sleeping. I felt weak every time I over-reacted to a stimulus. Once I admitted my struggles, I was able to actively seek help to overcome them. I also learned that I was not alone in my reaction to the divorce.There is help for those who are experiencing PTSD-like symptoms after a divorce. First, communicate your symptoms to your doctor or therapist. A checklist can be a useful tool, especially if you are having trouble putting words to your feelings. Be firm. I found that some therapists and doctors didn't really listen to me, rather they projected how they thought I should be feeling. Different therapies, including EMDR, have been shown to be effective against PTSD. There are medications that can be useful to limit the anxiety and to calm the mind and body. Additionally, mindfulness practices, including yoga and meditation, can also help to reset the sympathetic nervous system and regulate the release of stress hormones. In my case, medication helped me survive the first year while a combination of mindfulness training, yoga and exercise has alleviated most of the symptoms permanently. I still have moments of unexplained panic where a slight trigger causes an extreme reaction, but those moments are thankfully few and far between. I no longer feel like I'm a prisoner to my anxieties, trapped in a purgatory where I'm forced to relive those awful moments time and time again. I am now able to visit those memories without panic and live my life without waiting for the next blow. I never formally acquired the label of PTSD, but it served to be a valuable framework for me to understand and communicate my symptoms and to eventually overcome them. Labels, such as PTSD, can be helpful as we try to understand a complex situation, but even they only tell part of the story. Be gentle and understanding with yourself and others. Don't be quick to judge or make assumptions. Don't be ashamed to ask for assistance and admit when you cannot do it alone. Seek the help you need and know that it does get better."

(AP Photo/StarPix, Dave Allocca)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc3b63c00005b0009e362.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last year, as I started the search for the 2012 Red Dress Award honorees -- an event that Woman's Day holds annually to spotlight doctors, researchers and advocates who are making a difference in the fight against heart disease in women -- I came across two incredible women: Katherine Leon and Laura Haywood-Cory. When Katherine Leon had a heart attack in 2003 at just 38 years old, she was shocked to learn that it was due to a rare condition called spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) in which the coronary artery tears. But she was even more astonished when doctors said there was no research on SCAD and they couldn't explain why it happened, if it would happen again or whether her children were at risk for the condition. Right then and there she vowed to not only fully regain her own life, but to also save the lives of other women who might be at risk for SCAD. Katherine joined the online community of WomenHeart: The National Coalition for Women With Heart Disease, and gathered 70 SCAD survivor stories. She then asked Sharonne Hayes, MD, head of the Mayo Clinic Women's Heart Center in Rochester, Minn., to research the condition. Impressed that Katherine had already gathered 70 patients, Dr. Hayes was convinced that she could put together a study. So Katherine, along with fellow WomenHeart community member Laura-Haywood Cory (who had a heart attack from SCAD in March 2009 at age 40) recruited participants for a pilot study, which then lead to the development of a SCAD patient registry and a databank of DNA samples from patients and their families to test for genetic mutations. Over 400 people have volunteered for the registry so far, and Dr. Hayes hopes to discover what causes SCAD and how to treat and prevent this life-threatening condition, for which women seem to be at higher risk than men.Amazingly, Katherine and Laura not only survived heart disease -- they spearheaded groundbreaking research.The stories of Katherine and Laura show just how much progress has been made when it comes to raising awareness of heart disease in women -- and how far we have yet to go. Back in 2000, when Woman's Day made heart disease in women its signature cause, advocacy groups like WomenHeart were just starting up and the American Heart Association had just released its first guidelines to prevent heart disease in women. Only 34 percent of women were aware that heart disease is their number one health risk. In the next four years, the women's heart health movement exploded with the establishment of The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's The Heart Truth in 2002 and the American Heart Association's Go Red For Women movement in 2004.To bring more attention to the cause, Woman's Day established the Red Dress Awards in 2004, and the progression of honorees over the last 10 years is a testament to the tremendous advances that are being made. Early on, it was a struggle to find prominent personalities who were speaking out. But in the past few years, Woman's Day has honored Laura Bush, Barbara Walters, Hoda Kotb, Star Jones and Dr. Mehmet Oz, and this year, our honorees include Olympic swimmer Dana Vollmer who, after triumphing over her own heart condition, has become an American Heart Association National Volunteer.The stories of female heart disease survivors like Katherine, Laura, Star and Dana are inspiring, yet every year when I start gathering stories to include in the special heart section in the February issue of Woman's Day, I'm disappointed that there are still so many women talking about how their heart disease was almost missed -- the woman who suddenly becomes winded on her daily walk but assumes she's just out of shape, the woman who is unusually tired for days but keeps putting off a visit to the doctor, and perhaps most upsetting, the woman who goes to the ER with chest pains but instead of being screened for heart disease, is told she's stressed out and sent home. So we must keep pushing. After all, research shows that just over half of women (54 percent) know that heart disease is their number one risk. While up from 34 percent, that number should be much closer to 100 percent. Celebrate the 10th National Wear Red Day with the AHA's Go Red for Women movement this Friday, February 1st and raise awareness of heart disease in women, but take it a step further: Find out if you're at risk for heart disease. Talk to your doctor. Talk to your relatives to see if anyone has a heart condition--including high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Exercise. Eat healthy. Take time to de-stress--and don't feel guilty for one second about putting yourself--and your own health--first. This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post and the American Heart Association in recognition of Wear Red Day, the aim of which is to raise awareness that heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women.

3,PARENTING,4 Ways Parents Can Prevent Underage Drinking,"Claire McCarthy, M.D., Contributor
Pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital, Assistant Professo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/underage-drinking_us_5b9cc447e4b03a1dcc81a8dd,"Let's be honest: When was the last time you talked about alcohol ads with your kids?

I don't mean in a ""Wow, that was a cool ad they had on during the Super Bowl,"" kind of way. I mean in a, ""Wow, they really make drinking alcohol look cool, don't they? But drinking alcohol can really get people into lots of trouble -- let's talk about it"" kind of way.I'm going to bet most of you haven't.Overall, the news when it comes to teens and alcohol is pretty good. Compared with 20 years ago, fewer teens drink alcohol. But still, a lot of them are drinking. According to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, two-thirds of high-schoolers have ever had a drink, a third of them drink regularly and a fifth of them binge drink. Alcohol is responsible for more adolescent deaths than all other drugs combined.I feel like the response of parents is often either ""Not my kid,"" or ""I was wild when I was younger and I turned out OK, she'll be fine."" My response to either one is this: What if you are wrong? Do you really want to take the chance?Parents can make all the difference when it comes to preventing underage and dangerous drinking by their kids. Here are four things you can do:Talk. Talk about the ads -- there are lots of them -- and why they are appealing, and what the truth is when it comes to alcohol. Talk about what they see in TV shows and movies. Talk when there is a car accident related to alcohol -- there are lots of those too. Have an ongoing dialogue. Start by middle school. Not only is that when the exposure can really start, both in the media and socially, but in middle school, they still talk to you. While setting rules and expectations and enforcing them is important, it's also important that you say more than: ""Don't drink."" That's a real conversation-stopper. Ask about what their friends are saying and doing; talk about peer pressure, role-play what they might do if offered alcohol. Help them understand that once kids start drinking together, things get dicey and dangerous.Be an involved parent. Not a helicopter one -- that's not good for anyone. But make sure you at least touch base every day. Go to the school open house and to teacher conferences and games and other events (volunteer to be a coach or chaperone). Support them in school and in other activities -- the more successful they are in and out of school, the less likely they are to get into trouble with substance abuse. When your kid goes out, ask where they are going and with whom. Get to know your kids' friends -- the biggest risk factor for underage drinking, it turns out, is having a best friend who drinks. Get to know the parents of those friends. (You don't have to be creepy about it, just friendly). If you do all this, not only are you more likely to pick up on a problem, but you also send a really clear message that your child, and their life, really matters to you.Some parents think that they can ""teach"" their children to drink moderately, or that letting them drink in their house with their supervision is a good idea. Besides the fact that it's breaking the law to let underage kids drink in your home, the simple truth is that because of where they are developmentally, you can't be sure they won't binge drink elsewhere.Be a good role model. The second biggest risk factor for underage drinking? A family history of dysfunctional drinking. I'm not just talking about alcoholism here, although that can run in families. I'm also talking about the message you send when alcohol is a big part of your social life, especially if your social life involves getting drunk. Kids always pay more attention to what we do than to what we say. If you want your child to have good judgment about alcohol, show it yourself.Don't be afraid to ask for help. Parenthood is really hard work, and all of us need help sometimes. If you are worried that your child may be using alcohol in risky ways, you don't need to handle it alone. There are people who can help, like your child's doctor, or school guidance counselor. Here at Boston Children's we have a really great program called the Adolescent Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) that helps teens and their families through substance abuse problems.For more information on preventing underage drinking, visit Teen Safe, which has lots of great resources for parents, and the website of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism."

And in the near future, people with gluten intolerance or celiac disease could have a pill so they can eat gluten, according to new research published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.Researchers at the University of California, Davis, and the University of Washington explained that healthy people without gluten intolerance or celiac disease have stomach enzymes that break down gluten without any consequence. But in people with these conditions, the broken-down gluten parts -- called peptides -- cause inflammation, leading to symptoms such as stomach pain, diarrhea and irritability. Now, the researchers have identified an enzyme that breaks down the peptides even further and have modified it in such a way that they believe could alleviate the painful symptoms that occur when someone with celiac or gluten intolerance consumes gluten. After identifying the naturally occurring enzyme, the researchers used computational modeling to engineer a new enzyme that was able to degrade nearly all of the peptides that affect celiac disease sufferers in under an hour. The computer engineered enzyme remains theoretical, but the researchers believe that it could lead to an actual treatment:""Through identification of a natural enzyme... we were able to generate an enzyme with potential as a therapeutic for celiac disease,"" wrote the researchers. According to the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness, one in every 133 people in the United States has celiac disease. However, a recent study from Columbia University Medical Center researchers found that celiac disease might be under-diagnosed in this country because of low biopsy rates. "

Schools, restaurants and anyone else serving food are more vulnerable to legal threats over food sensitivities after the Justice Department determined that severe food allergies can be classified as disabilities under federal law. People who suffer from celiac disease don't absorb nutrients well and can get sick from the gluten found in wheat, rye and barley. Celiac is a diagnosed illness that is more severe than gluten sensitivity, which some people self-diagnose. Millions of people are buying gluten free foods because they say they make them feel better, even if they donￂﾒt have a wheat allergy. (AP Photo/M.L. Johnson, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc29a2200005700d95d9f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From the proliferation of gluten-free items on grocery store shelves, to the emergence of gluten-free items at restaurants and bakeries, it's clear that the decision to forgo wheat, rye and barley products has become a lifestyle choice. For those with celiac disease or a separate issue known as gluten sensitivity, it's medically necessary to avoid products containing gluten. But as the Daily Beast reported earlier this week, some doctors have noticed that more people are taking up gluten-free diets to lose weight or mask extreme dieting and eating disorders. Evelyn Attia, director of the Columbia & Weill Cornell Center for Eating Disorders told The Huffington Post that throughout the last few years, gluten has increasingly been cited as a dietary restriction by people who are being treated for anorexia and bulimia. ""There's no question that more and more individuals are coming in claiming a sensitivity to gluten, asking to have only gluten-free items or a completely gluten-free diet. But that only tells us that in this day and age, that’s the diet du jour,"" Attia said. Several years ago, Attia said, there was a similar trend with patients who were adamant about being vegetarian or vegan. Gluten-free diets (for non-medical reasons) aren't unlike other diets that have gained notoriety through pop culture and the press. In fact, some celebrities who don't have celiac disease or gluten insensitivity still extoll the virtues of a gluten-free lifestyle. For example, Lady Gaga went gluten-free last summer to lose weight, and Gwenyth Paltrow has taken up the diet to lose holiday weight. Still, Attia explained, there is also a vulnerable population for whom a gluten-free diet can be problematic.""For some individuals, they will cling onto ways of eating,"" Attia said. ""Those diets will interface very dangerously with their vulnerability to develop an eating disorder. And that really may mask the initial phase or even may get in the way of the ability to engage in a treatment.""As Forbes previously reported, a high school cheerleading coach from Arizona noticed that at least three girls on her squad were lethargic and losing weight rapidly. When confronted, each girl claimed to have been diagnosed with a gluten allergy. Though the girls' parents confirmed their allergies, two of the students were later treated for eating disorders, and the third was eventually taken out of school.At the same time, gluten-free diets are on the rise for a legitimate reason: Many more people have an intolerance for gluten than did so in years past. As CBS notes, celiac disease is four times more common that it was 50 years ago. And it's estimated that as much as 6 percent of the U.S. adult population might have a gluten sensitivity (though that figure was based on patients at a celiac research center). While celiac disease -- an autoimmune disorder that can cause intestinal damage -- can be diagnosed through blood tests, a person with a gluten sensitivity may test negative for celiac but still exhibit some of its symptoms, such as bloating, fatigue and stomach problems. For some who do have celiac or an intolerance to gluten, having their medically necessary restrictions dubbed a fad diet, or a risk to those vulnerable to eating disorders, is proving frustrating. ""Just because select people have chosen to use Celiac Disease or gluten sensitivity to mask their eating disorder does not lessen the fact that there are millions of Americans who must follow this diet for legitimate health reasons,"" wrote blogger Kim Bouldin following the Forbes article. ""One actually has nothing to do with the other."" Still, there's no doubt that the number of people suffering from gluten intolerance can't account for the explosion of the gluten-free market in recent years; it's grown by 28 percent annually since 2008 and now sits at $4.2 billion, according to the Los Angeles Times. ""The vast majority of people that are fueling this industry right now are people that embrace the diet for non-medical necessity,"" Dr. Alessio Fasano with the Center for Celiac Research at MassGeneral Hospital for Children told HuffPost. ""These are the people who may have a misconception about what the gluten free diet is all about."" Fasano explained that if a person adopts a diet that relies largely on the gluten-free products available at grocery stores, he or she most likely wouldn't lose much weight. A gluten-free cookie or a piece of bread will be higher in calories than a regular one, he said.Still, Fasano argued that there's nothing wrong with giving up gluten for non-medical reasons.""Nutritionally speaking, gluten is totally useless,"" Fasano said. ""We evolved without gluten, and it's not a useful protein for us."" Fasano added that going without gluten shouldn't be confused with an extreme diet. ""You can eat everything you want but three grains,"" Fasano said. ""The caveat and the challenge is that these three grains are everywhere.""  "

(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc29b26000035007f9b67.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Dreams really do come true,"" says Jana Kramer on her website bio about her singing and acting career. And I'm sure she's saying the same thing about her newly gifted sparkler from fiance Brantley Gilbert. The two country singing lovebirds are now officially engaged thanks to this five-carat, round brilliant diamond engagement ring. The One Tree Hill actress told People that she's ""in love with it"" and ""can't stop looking at it!"" She can't stop looking at it because it's just that big. But in addition to the large carat weight, Jana's setting makes the diamond appear even larger. Her thin pave-set-diamond band makes the massive diamond pop out even more than if the band were thick or plain white gold. It helps as well that Jana's fingers are slender and long.So how much did this proposal prop actually cost Brantley? Well, in order to get a diamond to match the color of what are undoubtedly very high-quality pave stones, the center stone would have to be at least an H color. Also, because of the stone's size, the clarity grade would have to be higher than usual, since otherwise the imperfections would be visible to the naked eye (and we don't want any of that!). Assuming, then, that the diamond is at least an H color and VS1 clarity, the approximate value of this ring is between $250,000 and $300,000. (The diamond is probably similar to this one from James Allen)And while dreams of colossal bijoux really do come true for some lucky celebrities, for the rest of us, we need to be creative to score the big look on a small budget. Jana's ring is a case in point that setting the center diamond in a thin pave setting will make a diamond of any carat weight appear larger than it is.

When the duo disembarked at the famous King's Cross station, they stopped to check out Platform 9 3/4 (from ""Harry Potter,"" in case you didn't know), which received a permanent home in the New Western Departures Concourse in March 2012. There's no word as to why the royals waited until the end of January, instead of the actual birthday, to ride that rail. "

It's a job full of joy but it's also one of the hardest and most challenging. I have been seeing angels since I was a baby. I see them physically as I would see someone standing in front of me and I see them all the time. I see a guardian angel behind each and every person regardless of religion. I don't know why God lets me see angels when others can't. I don't think I'm special, or better than anybody else, I'm just an ordinary person -- and a mother.When I see women who are pregnant, I see angels around them celebrating. A few months ago, when I was in New York, I noticed a woman on the street who was pregnant. She was surrounded by angels and they were dancing around her full of joy, so excited about the little baby who was to be born. For a moment, I could see the infant inside of her. I was shown the love that this baby had for its mother and the joy it was feeling because of the way its mother was protecting it and keeping it safe. A child loves its mother long before it is born.The angels have told me that each and every child chooses its parents before it is conceived. That each child chooses knowing everything about their parents -- the good and the bad, including that they might not be the best parents. I can't explain why unborn souls choose a particular parent but I can tell you that if you are a parent your child loves you long before it is born. Babies also choose adoptive or long-term foster parents. Sometimes a soul will choose more than two parents, knowing that a parent might die or be unable to rear it.Occasionally when I am shown a baby in its mother's tummy the angels around the mother will tell me that this little baby is not going to stay, and I will understand there will be a miscarriage. Despite this, the angels show me all the love that this tiny baby is pouring out onto the mother it has chosen. I know that this little soul loves its parents so deeply that even after it has miscarried and gone to Heaven, and is happy there, it is with its parents when they need it. I am now speaking at events all around the world and have the chance to meet and talk with people from all nationalities and religions. Frequently at events a mother or father will ask me a question like, ""What is my destiny?"" or ""What is my life purpose?"" When I refer to their children they will often dismiss their role as a parent, sometimes talking of being a parent as if it is an obstacle put in the way of more important things or is interfering with their real life purpose.They have this so wrong -- there is no more important role or life purpose than being a parent. Each and every mother has the most important job in the world: to turn their children into kind, loving, caring members of the community, who know right from wrong. Mothers and fathers shape the future of the world, because they shape their children. The future of our world depends on the values and behaviours parents teach their children through their words and their example. This is why there is simply no more important job in the world. Many parents talk to me about the challenges they face with their children, how stressful life can be and how hopeless and alone they sometimes feel. I remind them that they have a guardian angel with them -- that I see a guardian angel with every person, regardless of their religion (or lack of one) and have never seen a person in the world without a guardian angel. This guardian angel is there especially for them and never ever leaves them for one moment from before they are born until after they die. It is there to help and guide them and if they ask can give them so much help.I remind parents that their child also has a guardian angel and that they can ask their own guardian angel to ask their child's guardian angel to help their child.Many mothers and fathers have told me that knowing that both they and their children have a guardian angel has made them better parents. Knowing that there are angels there to help them has made life easier. They tell me that when they find themselves getting irritated or stressed they become conscious of the promptings of their guardian angel, telling them to be patient. They then feel themselves relaxing and becoming more loving and because of this they notice their homes and families becoming more joyful. "
