Your attempt to outlaw an opposing political party, your use of your National Intelligence Service (NIS) for political purposes, your cabinet's obstruction of justice in attempts to investigate the NIS, your attempt to cast as disloyal to South Korea all who disagree with your administration, your use of illegal surveillance of civilians, your use of Cold War rhetoric to attack those who legitimately question your policies, and your use of official resources, including state social media resources, to influence the result of elections, raise legitimate questions about whether or not you have any commitment to democratic values.Today, Sunday July 27th, I join others in Washington DC, and people around the country and around the world, to observe the 61st anniversary of the Korean War Armistice. It is my hope that the 33,686 US soldiers who gave their lives in Korea, together with another 8,176 US soldiers who were missing in action, did not make the ultimate sacrifice in defense of your freedom to enable freedom's destruction under your government.In today's world, there is always an intersection of interests. As members of the US Congress learn of your policies, you may well find that it will be necessary to correct your course by stopping all practices that undermine principles of democracy, self-governance, separation of powers and human rights.In honor of the Armistice, please give the world a chance to celebrate your commitment to the values which brought this nation to your defense.

Most of America’s largest companies have managed to increase revenue, profitability, and shareholder distributions, sending their share prices to record highs. A few companies, on the other hand, haven’t achieved the same growth levels. In fact, over the past 10 years, some S&P 500-listed companies have consistently shrunk.Economic headwinds hurt the sales of some companies. Other companies shrunk because they spun off or divested business segments. Based on 24/7 Wall St.’s review of S&P 500 companies, these are America’s 10 fastest shrinking companies.After being hurt by the recession, several industries have been thriving in recent years. Notably, while GM and Chrysler needed a government-financed bailout to survive the recession, eventually America’s automotive sector recovered as car and light truck sales have rebounded. By contrast, U.S. homebuilders have struggled to boost sales in the wake of the recovery, as new housing starts remain well below historical levels. Two of the companies with the largest declines in sales during the last 10 years are home builders PulteGroup and Lennar.While economic reasons were behind several large long-term revenue drops, divestitures were the primary cause of the declines in most of the other companies. These activities have been especially common in the oil and gas sector. Marathon Oil, Williams, and ConocoPhillips each spun off units into new, separately-run companies.In other instances, the companies that reported large drops in revenue were conglomerates that elected to break up their empires. For instance, once-troubled Tyco International split itself into three businesses in 2007. What remained of Tyco was again split three ways in 2011. Altria Group, too, spun off its brewing operations, its international cigarette operations, as well as Kraft Foods in the 2000s.In other instances, America’s fastest shrinking companies divested operations that simply did not fit into their businesses. H&R Block sold its financial advisory and mortgage servicing units to focus further on its bread-and-butter tax advisory business. In another notable instance, Pepco sold its power plant unit in order to shed exposure to commodity fluctuations.A shrinking business may, in fact, often serve as a blessing in disguise to shareholders. Motorola split itself into two companies in 2011, Motorola Solutions and Motorola Mobility. The latter, which sold Motorola phones and other home products, has struggled substantially since the split. While shareholders cashed out in a sale to Google, the business has continued to struggle. Meanwhile, Motorola Solutions, the shares of which have performed well without Motorola Mobility weighing them down, has decided to spin off yet another business and shrink further.In order to identify America’s fastest shrinking companies, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the S&P 500 companies that had the largest revenue declines over their last 10 full fiscal years. We excluded companies that filed for bankruptcy or are no longer in the S&P 500. Sources included the Securities and Exchange Commission, S&P Capital IQ, and Morningstar.These are America’s fastest shrinking companies, according to 24/7 Wall St.:"

He lives for the kick of things. At first, the mayhem is reasonably innocent. He's high-strung, never sitting still. He gets in fights. Mixed-martial arts kind of fights: he's a great roundhouse kicker, as well. He argues - the outcome doesn't matter - because he likes to pit himself against others. Because he's charismatic, it's almost an endearing trait. The problem is, he can't stay in one job. Incredibly educated and accomplished, he's left over 30 jobs. When he falls suddenly and cataclysmically in love with a psychiatrist, Shaina (Jacqueline Fernandez) who lives in Poland, all hell breaks loose. All that passion, all that wackiness, it drives a wedge between them. They part, and her heart is broken.Her parents have brokered her a marriage with Himanshu (Radeep Hooda). He's an up-and-coming cop. They meet and talk. They quickly realize they have no love connection. She tells him of her time in India with Devi. As we see in flashback, it's a dashing, romantic, and, ultimately, a doomed tale. He tells her of the Devil, a criminal mastermind that he's chasing. His other successes mean nothing if he can't nail the guy. Their stories intersect in an ingenious way. Kick, written by Raiat Arora, directed by Sajid Nadiadwala isn't just an action film with a potent kick. It's also a reminder to not question what someone does but why one does it. It sets you up thinking it's a battle between a diabolically clever criminal and a remarkably effective cop. The prize is not just all the money Devi makes off with. It's also Shaina's hand. The fight scenes, the cat and mouse games, they're all captivating in their energy and execution. We root for Himanshu, while we've come to wonder why Devi, of whom no one prior had ever said a bad word, could turn so evil. Appearances, though, are deceiving. Khan is a formidable Devi. He's got the muscles, the brains and, as we learn, the heart of a hero. Like all junkies, he wants nothing out of life but the next rush. He sticks up for the underdog, especially, as you'll see, at the end. He takes out a band of thugs disrespecting a woman. He's fearless, engaging, and awe-inspiring. You get the sense that he holds nothing back in his characterization of the once lovable, now despised Devi. Minus one notable quality, Hooda's Himanshu is the appropriate adversary for Khan's Devi. He's intelligent, meticulous, and relentless. Though it's not apparent at first, they both share a desire to serve and protect. The one thing that Khan's Devi has that Hooda's Himanshu doesn't is this craziness (to see where it comes from, check out his parents, played by Archana Puran Singh and Mithun Chakraborty) that propels him ever forward. Fernandez's Shaina is enchanting as the beautiful, successful career woman who mourns a lost love. Her transformation in one of the song and dance scenes from mousy, glasses-wearing psychiatrist to sumptuous sex kitten is breathtaking. Nadiadwala fits the story with a well-adjusted adrenaline pump. The film perfectly balances the action scenes (bus chases, jumping out of skyscraper windows, battles royale) with the love scenes. The climax turns into a rainbow of discovery. We learn something about the Devil that is almost angelic. "

Now we will go to New Hampshire where my brother-in-law Gabriel lives. They will help us. We will be all together as a true family.”Ibrahim, 27, was spared a death sentence for apostasy and then barred from leaving Sudan.She was flown to Rome in secret by the Italian government on Thursday (July 24) with husband Daniel Wani, her 20-month-old son Martin, and daughter Maya, who was born in a Khartoum prison two months ago.Wani has joint Sudanese-American citizenship and the family is expected to fly to the U.S. in the coming days.Within hours of landing in Italy, Ibrahim and her family met with Pope Francis, who thanked her for her courage and staying true to her faith despite the threat of execution.“I never believed I would fulfill my lifelong dream — to meet the pope,” Ibrahim reportedly said. “I have always wanted and only wanted my faith. The love of my husband is a gift from God.”Ibrahim had been trapped in Sudan after her release from prison, where she had been awaiting execution for refusing to renounce Christianity. Even though she has been a Christian her entire life, Sudan considers her a Muslim because her father is Muslim.She gave birth in chains to Maya in a Khartoum jail cell in May after her father claimed she had abandoned Islam and committed adultery with her Christian husband, as mixed-faith marriages are considered illegal.“When I was asked to renounce my Christian faith, I knew what I was risking. But I did not want to renounce it,” Ibrahim told La Repubblica.The Italian foreign ministry said Ibrahim was not available for media interviews; Napoli spoke to her via telephone."
6,GREEN,How Frustration And Inaction Color EPA's Efforts To Enforce The Clean Water Act,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-clean-water-act_n_5622074.html,,2014-07-26,"<strong>San Pedro River Downstream near San Pedro House</strong> Here, from the same viewpoint as the previous picture, is a northward downstream view of San Pedro River. This area has large gravelbar sections. This portion of the river is south of the Highway 90 bridge near the San Pedro House area.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15b552000003000ff9ea8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This article originally appeared on ProPublica.For years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been frustrated in its efforts to pursue hundreds of cases of water pollution — repeatedly tied up in legal fights about exactly what bodies of water it has the authority to monitor and protect. Efforts in Congress to clarify the EPA's powers have been defeated. And two Supreme Court decisions have done little to decide the question.Most recently, in April, the EPA itself declared what waters were subject to its oversight — developing a joint rule with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that sought to end the debate and empower the EPA to press hundreds of enforcements actions against alleged polluters across the country.The new rule, for instance, explicitly defines several terms — tributary, floodplain and wetland — and makes clear that those waters are subject to its authority.But the EPA's effort has been met with immense opposition from farmers who say the agency is overreaching. An expansive online campaign organized and financed by the American Farm Bureau Federation has asserted that the new rule will give the EPA jurisdiction over farmers' irrigation ditches, watering ponds and even puddles of rain.The American Farm Bureau Federation's president, Bob Stallman, said the proposed rule was the ""the biggest federal land grab — in terms of power over land use — that we've seen to date.""In an effort to address the concerns of farmers, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in recent weeks has been touring states in the Midwest.""There are issues we need to discuss and clarify to get this rule right,"" she said. ""We have important work to do. All the silly contentions being brought up — that we intend to regulate dry ground or stock ponds or mud puddles after a rain — all that does is get in the way of our being able to have those serious discussions.""The Clean Water Act of 1972 authorized the EPA to protect the ""waters of the United States"" from dangerous and or illegal pollution. But that term has been the subject of controversy and dispute virtually from the time the act was signed into law. Regulators and industry representatives are generally in agreement that the law applies to some of the nation's larger rivers. At issue, however, are the streams that flow intermittently and the wetlands adjacent to these streams that dry up during the summer.Legal fights over those streams and wetlands, current and former EPA officials say, have cost the agency time, money and effectiveness in the face of real environmental threats. Indeed, in recent years the EPA has allowed hundreds of cases of water pollution to go unpunished because it currently lacks the confidence that it can prevail in court.Granta Nakayama, who served as the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance at the EPA until 2009, found that between July 2006 and March 2008 the agency had decided not to pursue formal enforcement in 304 cases because of jurisdictional uncertainty.In 2008, in an internal memo, Nakayama wrote that the uncertainty ""results in delays in enforcement and increases the resources needed to bring enforcement cases.""And so in 2007, when an oil company discharged thousands of gallons of crude oil into Edwards Creek in Titus County, Texas, the EPA did not issue a fine, pursue legal action or even require clean up. Similarly, after a farming operation dumped manure into tributaries that fed Lake Blackshear in Georgia, the EPA did not seek to hold the polluting company responsible — despite the fact that tests showed unsafe levels of bacteria and viruses in the lake, which was regularly used for waterskiing and other recreation.""The proposed rule will improve the process for making jurisdictional determinations for the Clean Water Act by minimizing delays and costs, and will improve the predictability and consistency of the permit and enforcement process for landowners,"" an EPA spokesperson said.The EPA expects that improving efficiency in jurisdictional determinations will also save the businesses that they regulate time and money.""Protecting water is important to the long-term health of the economy,"" the EPA spokesperson said. ""Streams and wetlands are economic drivers because of their role in fishing, hunting, agriculture, recreation, energy, and manufacturing.""Two Supreme Court decisions in the last 15 years have been the cause of much of the uncertainty.In a 5-4 ruling in 2001, the Court held that the Army Corps of Engineers could not require permits for waters based on their use as a habitat by migratory birds. The Court ruling also included language that seemed to assert that only wetlands with a ""significant nexus"" to traditional navigable waterways would be protected under the Clean Water Act. The Court did not make clear the meaning of the term ""significant nexus.""And in 2006, the Court, asked to determine whether a wetland needed to be adjacent to a traditional navigable waterway in order to be protected, wound up split, and reached no majority decision.By the EPA's own estimates, 2 million stream miles outside of Alaska are regarded as ""intermittent,"" and 20 percent of roughly 110 million acres of wetlands are considered ""isolated."" As a result of the inability of the government to clarify the EPA's jurisdiction over the last 15 years, these water bodies are currently unprotected.""At some level this is a very frustrating debate to be having because water is all connected at some level,"" said Jon Devine, a senior attorney in the water program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""What the Supreme Court's decisions do is throw into significant doubt what is protected.""As a result, in cases where a polluted waterway isn't clearly under the EPA's jurisdiction, the agency has sometimes spent thousands of dollars to model water flow and conduct studies to show that it is hydrologically connected to larger water bodies that are protected.""It just causes an incredible waste of resources and rewards those who don't really worry about compliance and punishes those who do,"" said Nakayama, now an environmental lawyer at Kirkland & Ellis in Washington.In past years, federal legislators have tried to introduce bills that address the ambiguity in the Clean Water Act's language, but none have passed both the House and Senate.In 2011, when Congress was considering a bill that made many of the changes that EPA's current rule would, the American Farm Bureau Federation, as part of the Waters Advocacy Coalition, used a similar media strategy to kill the bill. The Coalition was made up of different industry groups that would be affected by the bill including mining associations and homebuilders.The New York Times reported than an unnamed member of the Coalition said, ""The game plan is to emphasize the scary possibilities. If you can get Glenn Beck to say that government storm troopers are going to invade your property, farmers in the Midwest will light up their congressmen's switchboards.""This time around, the pushback by farmers and others --- called the ""Ditch the Rule"" campaign -- has mainly taken place online. The Farm Bureau organization has created a separate website for the campaign and created shareable videos and infographics. The organization has also been effective in recruiting state farming associations to join the campaign. It has resulted in a blitz of social media posts and a steady stream of local coverage often favoring the farmers' point of view.""The campaign has energized our grassroots to participate,"" said Don Parrish, senior director of regulatory relations at the American Farm Bureau Federation. Although the campaign does not have a large amount of money flowing into it, Parrish said it has really ""struck a chord.""Lisa Garcia, a former administrator of environmental justice at the EPA, said the effort by the federation is chiefly one of misinformation.""The rule is not adding or expanding the scope of waters historically protected,"" said Garcia, who is currently at Earthjustice, an environmental non-profit organization. She said the opposition she has seen fits ""this pattern of just completely fighting against any new regulation.""Parrish disagrees. He said that the tensions that are playing out are because ""the EPA is trying to create regulations that do an end run around the Supreme Court and Congress.""""[The EPA is] really reaching into areas that Congress clearly didn't want the EPA to regulate. They did not intend to put EPA in the land use business,"" he said.For more on the challenges facing the Clean Water Act, read ProPublica's work on the water woes facing residents living close to gas drilling and their series on the BP oil spill disaster."
7,POLITICS,This Congressman Wants To Give You The Right To Sue Union Busters,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/labor-organizing-civil-right_n_5622057.html,,2014-07-26,"Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., one of only two Muslim's in Congress, testifies before the House Homeland Security Committee on the extent of the radicalization of American Muslims, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, March 10, 2011. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d0ac2000000f0201d127.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- If your boss tramples on your right to organize in the workplace, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) believes you should be able to sue for damages in federal court. He plans to introduce a bill in Congress next week that would grant you that very right.""Union busters are on the march and are aggressive,"" Ellison, a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told HuffPost. ""I think the [legal] options that are offered by the current process are not adequate.""Under U.S. labor law, workers have relatively limited recourse in the face of union busting. When workers are fired for union organizing, they can file what's known as an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board, the agency that enforces labor law. If the board pursues the charge against the employer, the worker can win back pay and reinstatement, but not the sort of damages associated with, say, sexual discrimination in the workplace.As he explained it, Ellison's plan, first reported by MSNBC, would amend the National Labor Relations Act to make labor organizing something akin to a federal civil right. Within 180 days of filing a charge with the labor board, the worker would have the right to file a claim against the employer in federal court. There, the worker would be entitled not only to damages, but also attorney fees, drastically increasing the potential liability of an employer who runs afoul of the law.That, Ellison said, is the underlying idea of the legislation -- to create a greater disincentive for companies to punish pro-union workers.""If you have to worry about getting sued and paying real damages, and perhaps going through a discovery process, which might unearth some ugly tactics, then maybe you will rethink retaliating against and firing workers,"" Ellison said. Ellison said his proposal's lead backers will include Reps. John Lewis (D-Ga.), John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). But because the proposal would significantly change labor law and serve as a boon to the thinning ranks of organized labor, it would have approximately zero chance of passing the GOP-controlled House of Representatives. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce didn't respond to a request for comment on the proposal, though it could be expected to lobby hard against the measure -- if it ever got close to the House floor. Despite its long-shot odds in the current Congress, the bill could be reintroduced in subsequent sessions and may prompt a discussion about U.S. labor law and the need for it to protect workers.That's the hope of Moshe Marvit, an attorney and fellow at the Century Foundation, who in 2012 co-authored a book with Richard D. Kahlenberg and Thomas Geoghegan called Why Labor Organizing Should Be a Civil Right.""I'm just hoping it's one of those things that keeps getting reintroduced and spurs a conversation,"" Marvit said of the bill. ""These things take a long time. I'm hoping it changes the nature of how people think about labor rights.""Ellison said Why Labor Organizing Should Be a Civil Right served as the foundation for his proposal. The book argues that ossified labor law has contributed to the shrinking union density of the U.S., where less than 7 percent of private-sector workers now belong to a union. Making organizing a protection under the Civil Rights Act, the authors write, would not only deter union-busting, but change the way Americans understand workplace rights. Ellison said his bill would amend the National Labor Relations Act so as not to ""open up"" more ideological fights surrounding the Civil Rights Act. But the measure would grant workers a recourse similar to that under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which forbids employers from discriminating based on gender, race and religion.Marvit said that granting workers a private right to sue may have an additional consequence: Encouraging more attorneys to specialize in collective bargaining law on behalf of workers, potentially leading to more such lawyers assuming judgeships. ""Right now if you're an attorney [in this area], unless you work for a union, there's no work for you,"" Marvit said. ""No worker is going to go out and hire an attorney for an NLRB case."" As a consequence, he added, ""the number of judges who have experience in this area is really slim.""The NLRB itself has been a political flashpoint during the Obama years. GOP leaders and business groups have pilloried the decisions of the board's Democratic majority as being too union-friendly. Unions, meanwhile, say the board is simply carrying out its mission, which is to protect workers' rights and investigate unfair labor practices.Bill Samuel, the AFL-CIO's director of government affairs, said that the NLRB serves ""a very useful function,"" but in the end its powers are limited. The labor federation supports Ellison's proposal and consulted with his office as it was crafted.""The protections are really completely inadequate,"" Samuel said of current law. ""They haven't kept pace with the increasing viciousness of anti-union efforts. It can take years for a worker who's been illegally discharged to get his or her job back. The only penalty is a portion of the back wages, offset by what the worker earned, and reinstatement, which is not always a good option for someone who's moved on with their lives.""Drawing a line between falling union membership and stagnating wages, Ellison said he believed the proposal could ultimately help close the income gap.""Can you credibly do something about income inequality without strengthening the right to organize?"" Ellison said. ""No way."""

Really good art and music tends to have that effect I find -- tapping into our core and hitting the spot without knowing, or having to know why.The Lost Tea Party is no exception to this and it hasn't even been fully built yet. A Burning Man honorarium project conceived by Mutoid Waste protagonist Wreckage, the sculpture will be a 100 ft train of giant camel shaped tea pots pulled by an old 4x4 weapons carrier. Nothing ordinary about that. Yet after four weeks of running the Kickstarter and helping with the project I am once again getting that old sense of familiarity. Already it seems natural that camels should be shaped like giant tea pots. Why wouldn't they be?   It's not the first time Mutoid Waste have made it to Burning Man. Four of them took to the sands in 2008 -- the year of the American Dream. Led by the vision of Joe Rush and Wreckage, a pair who often collaborate together, they built the magnificent Rustang Sally and Franken Wagen. Typically over-ambitious, Rustang Sally was created in a frenzy of activity over a very concentrated space of time. Later the build was described by one of them as like ""scrap heap challenge on crystal meth"", though it's safe to say no such stimulants were actually used in the making of Sally.Mutoid Waste's reputation for ""scrap metal fabrications of form and fiction"" now spans 30 years and emerged from the squatting spirit of '80s London. Despite being conceived in heady times however, their inclinations were very much anti political. They were, and still are a loose collective of creative people that just wanted to be free to create a wild spectacle of art and music. Joe Rush is credited with starting the collective and still maintains a type of stewardship. Alongside him was his friend Robin Cooke who moved to Australia and set up his own Mutoid thing down under. Then there's Wreckage, Lyle, Sam Haggerty, Giles Walker, Scrapper, Debs to name just some. All of them are also very much artists in their own right and like many others on the Mutoid roll call, will come together and then go off again, or not, as the tide takes them.Perhaps not unsurprisingly given their haphazard ways and wide geographical span, the Mutoid history is as yet not that thoroughly documented, although there are some good overviews from various sources including Mutate Britain. Most that have heard of them by name will know that they took their illimitable imaginations, sound systems and probably highly illegal vehicles and fled Thatcherite impositions in the early 90s in search of another place to do yet more mad stuff. And that's what they did in Berlin then Italy, Australia and eventually Japan, USA and beyond. Some eventually went home to take up a rightful residency in Glastonbury's less conventional arenas. More recently they were asked to be part of the 2012 Paralympics Closing Ceremony, by far their biggest gig to date.In 2008, when they last went to Burning Man, they were late onto the Playa and no one really knew they were coming. Although that did nothing to diminish their impact back then, things are a little different this year. For one thing, the Paralympics gig happened forcing them all to recognize their brilliance in a wider arena that stretches far beyond the appreciative eyes of their sub culture roots. As a result things have got busier. For Glastonbury this year while Joe Rush worked on his show A Kiss On The Apocalypse, Wreckage focused on teapots and the Playa. Outward appearances also point to these brilliant but ramshackle scrapyardees getting a little bit more organised over time. Maybe. And a little bit more biz savvy. Perhaps. Either way it makes no difference. What matters is that when you see the result in all its splendor and mightiness, that sense of awe, disbelief, joy and knowingness triggers up all over again. Wreckage's vision of a lost party of mutated camel tea pots finding their way across the dunes and onto Black Rock City is likely to make a breath-taking spectacle. A much needed reminder that humans can be awesome and also that what we most like to do is play."

The USPS is projecting a loss of as much as a $6 billion for the year as it keeps pressure on Congress for help, Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said this month. The service is scheduled to release second-quarter results May 10. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d0ae2100004502c9634a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The United States Postal Service (USPS) management just ran into a possible game-changing obstacle to its shameful pursuit of a fully privatized post office: labor solidarity.Here's the background. For a decade the USPS has been aggressively shrinking, consolidating, and outsourcing the nation's postal system. In July 2011 management upped the ante by announcing the rapid closure of 3600 local post offices, a step toward the eventual closing of as many as 15,000, half of all post offices in the nation.A groundswell of opposition erupted. Citizens in hundreds of towns mobilized to save a treasured institution that plays a key and sometimes defining role in their communities. In December 2011, after Congress appeared ready to impose a six-month moratorium on closures USPS management voluntarily adopted a freeze of the same length.In May 2012, the moratorium ended but management, possibly concerned about reviving a national backlash, embraced an ingenious stealth strategy. Rather than closures, management moved to slash hours at 13,000 post offices. That could be accomplished quickly. Reduction in hours, unlike outright closures, requires little justification. Appeals are limited. Moreover a reduction in hours doesn't generate the same level of outrage as a closure. The building remains open even though its value to the community is dramatically diminished.By the end of this year management may achieve its goal. Already 9,000 post offices have had their hours cut drastically. Part-time inexperienced non-career employees have replaced full time experienced career postmasters. Management duly held meetings in every affected community but refused to heed or even respond to the counsel of local residents and businesses or provide them the data used to justify its decisionPostal clerks and letter carriers are the personal face of the most ubiquitous, trusted and respected of all public institutions. By gradually replacing to-the-door service with delivery to more remote cluster mailboxes management has already reduced our personal interaction with letter carriers.Last fall USPS management proceeded with the second phase in its campaign to sever our personal links to the postal clerks by quietly launching a pilot project in 82 Staples stores. After the news became public management ingenuously announced that nothing had changed. ""Staples joins with more than 65,000 retailers ... who currently provide expanded access to postal products and services."" Management conveniently forgot to mention that these 65,000 locations just sell stamps or flat boxes. None hosts a postal counter staffed by a retail employee that sells services.The arrangement with Staples is different. As management conceded, Staples ""is the first retailer to take part in a USPS pilot program dubbed the Retail Partner Expansion Program."" The Retail Partner Expansion Program creates mini post offices into big box stores.If the pilot proves successful the USPS expects to expand it to all 1,500 Staples. And then to all big box retail outlets. Steve Hutkins, creator of the inestimable SaveOurPostOffice.org runs the numbers. We can now buy stamps at 7,450 Walgreens; 3,830 Wal-Marts; 1,632 Staples; 1,200 Office Depots; 847 Safeways; 609 Sam's Clubs; and 426 Costcos. That adds up to over 14,000 locations. ""If all of those arrangements were converted from selling stamps on consignment to setting up postal counters, the Postal Service would have an instant infrastructure of ""mini post offices"" to replace real post offices...""A bill introduced by Rep. Darrell's Issa (R-CA) would make this replacement much easier. According to Section 103 of the Postal Reform Act of 2013 the right to appeal a post office closing to the Postal Regulatory Commission ""shall not apply to a determination of the Postal Service to close a post office if there is located, within twpo miles of such post office, a qualified contract postal unit."" There are 1,200 post offices within two miles of just the Staples retail network.For management replacing a real post office with a fake post office is a good deal. USPS average pay is about $25 an hour. Staples retail clerks earn about $8.50 an hour.For the customer this is a bad deal. Staples' employees receive just four hours of ""classroom"" training for postal retail duties. Postal retail clerks receive 32 hours of intense classroom training, followed by 40 hours of on-the-job training alongside experienced window clerks. Postal workers must pass a test before they are considered qualified to work the window. Given the turnover at Staples it's unlikely the employee at the postal counter is going to be around long enough to acquire the experience or expertise of a career postal worker.For the community this is an awful deal. A cherished local institution created to serve the public interest would be replaced by a counter in a business created to serve distant shareholders and management. If its economic self-interest dictated Staples could decide to close the store. To underline the reality of this threat in March Staples announced it will shutter up to 225 stores. That would leave the community without any postal services at all.Labor Solidarity to the RescueThe American Postal Workers Union (APWU) responded to management's hostile action by organizing protests around the country. On April 24 a Day of Action resulted in hundreds of pickets, marches and rallies in more than 50 cities across 27 states under the rallying cry, ""Stop Staples: The U.S. Mail is Not for Sale"".In late May, Staples Vice Chairman Joe Doody nervously acknowledged the USPS deal ""could become a problem if more unions backed the postal workers."" He told the Boston Globe, ""The retailer will continue to evaluate the situation to determine whether the negative backlash is worth the benefits of the partnership,"" Staples had signed the deal because it was desperate to gain more traffic through its stores. If the deal actually reduces traffic and sales, Staples would reconsider.State labor unions and national federations began to endorse the ""Don't Buy Staples"" campaign. On May 30, when the AFL-CIO, comprised of 56 unions representing 12.5 million members came out in support of the boycott. In mid-June California's Service Employees International Union 32BJ, representing 145,000 union members in 11 states and the District of Columbia, voted for a boycott. In a letter to the Staples CEO SEUI 32BJ President Héctor Figueroa observed, ""The Postal Service is the largest single civilian employer of union middle-class jobs for African Americans, and Veterans (including disabled veterans), and is the largest single civilian union employer. We need more of these types of jobs to strengthen our economy and the middle class, and we will not accept your efforts to undermine them through low-wage privation.""After July 4, more unions formally joined the boycott. Perhaps they were inspired by Benjamin Franklin's enduring comment at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, ""We must all hang together or assuredly we shall all hang separately."" In July, the International Association of Firefighters representing more than 300,000 backed the boycott. AFSCME union, representing 1.6 million public-sector workers, followed suit. Then on July 12American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten responded. ""Who does Staples really want and need to come into its stores every single day? Teachers. The best way we can help is if we say to Staples: 'You do this to the postal workers, and we aren't buying supplies in your stores.'""School supplies are a key market for Staples, accounting for up to one-third of its sales. Last year teachers spent about $1.6 billion of their own money on school supplies. Back-to-school supply-buying gets going in earnest in late July.On July 14, Staples announced it had withdrawn from the Retail Partner Expansion Program.The celebrations have been muted. Management hasn't thrown in the towel. It's simply changed the name of the program. As one USPS spokesperson explained, ""We look forward to continuing the partnership whether it's called Retail Partner Expansion or approved shipper."" The USPS wants to establish a beachhead in thousands of retail stores. Once a postal counter staffed by low paid non union non postal service employees begins to sell services it will be easy to expand the kinds of services it offers.But Staples announcement and USPS' obfuscation demonstrates that retail stores are vulnerable to boycotts, especially those organized by people in the communities they serve. Teachers, firefighters, government workers, service employees live in significant numbers in every community. They can form the backbone of an effort that puts big box retailers and USPS management on notice. Hands off our post office!And who knows? Hands off our post office could evolve into give us back our post office. A successful boycott to stop the further privatization of the post office could then move demand that the post office be restored to its former glory and effectiveness by reopening processing centers, extending local post office hours and rehiring experienced staff. Benjamin Franklin, the first Postmaster General of the United States, would be pleased."

John Walsh (D-Mont.) is backtracking on earlier statements suggesting post-traumatic stress disorder from his Iraq War military service played a role in why he plagiarized his masters’ thesis in 2007.In an interview Friday with KMMS Radio in Bozeman, Walsh clarified comments he made Wednesday to The Associated Press claiming his “head was not in a place very conducive to a classroom and an academic environment” at the time he wrote his thesis because he was being treated for PTSD.“One thing … I would really like to clear up is that I am in no way -- no way -- tying what I did to any type of PTSD,” Walsh told KMMS. “It had nothing to do with the mistake that I made. People are trying to say I may have said that. … That is not in any way what I meant or said.”Since The New York Times revealed Wednesday that Walsh plagiarized at least a quarter of his master’s thesis without citations for his degree from from the United States Army War College, he’s been criticized by veterans upset over his bringing PTSD into the discussion.“I feel like it's a slap in the face to people who have obviously been through more than he has,” Iraq and Afghanistan combat veteran Brian Rudolph of Great Falls, Montana, told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. “I just don't see how if you have a PTSD issue it's going to cause you to plagiarize a paper. I can see how somebody could have a flashback and hit their spouse while they're sleeping. But if you're totally cognizant typing a paper and then say, ‘Ah I'm a little bit depressed so I'm not going to cite this.' It just doesn't make sense.”The Army War College, in Pennsylvania, said it has found preliminary evidence of plagiarism and asked a review board to investigate. The school may revoke Walsh's degree if it finds he intentionally presented the work of others as his own. "

But the count is just beginning, to hear the man who holds the record of 18 major titles.“I think he’s going to win a lot of major championships,” Jack Nicklaus said Thursday via conference call. “I like his swagger ... his confidence.”Nicklaus said he figures McIlroy will set records along the way. How many, and how many majors he’ll end up with, depends on the Northern Irishman’s desire, Nicklaus said.""Some players want to live a normal life and others decide records are important and want to leave a legacy, Nicklaus said. “Whichever direction Rory heads, he’ll be successful,” Nicklaus said. “He’s the one who has to decide.”Nicklaus gave McIlroy a swing tip when the two met at Nicklaus’ office in south Florida before the U.S. Open. But the Golden Bear said he doesn’t know whether the Ulsterman used it in winning last week’s Open Championship at Royal Liverpool in Hoylake, England.“I saw a couple of things that I thought could help him,” Nicklaus said. “I didn’t want to interfere with his teacher. … Rory seemed very much at ease (with his swing) at the British. But he may not have remembered or thought about (the Nicklaus tip). Whether I helped him, I don’t know.”Nicklaus, of course, was asked about 14-time major winner Tiger Woods, who has looked rusty in five of his six competitive rounds since returning from March 31 microdiscectomy. Nicklaus said he thought Woods’ swing looked good in an opening 69 at the Open and wasn’t sure what went wrong after that.But he’s optimistic Woods will return to strong form soon. “He’ll be back and do pretty good,” he said.Nicklaus didn’t hesitate when asked whether Woods should be picked for the U.S. Ryder Cup team that will play Europe in late September in Gleneagles, Scotland.“Absolutely,” Nicklaus said. “If I were the captain, I would be hard-pressed (not to select him). I don’t care what he does (in his next two or more tournaments). I would choose him.”Asked what advice he would give Woods if he were his coach, Nicklaus said, “Tiger probably knows what he has to do. He’s smart. He understands his game. I don’t think it’s my place to give him advice.”Nicklaus, who celebrated his 54th wedding anniversary Tuesday, also talked about the many changes to his course designs that will play host to the PGA Championship (Valhalla) and the Ryder Cup (Gleneagles Centenary).The greens were redone at Valhalla, and tweaks were made to every hole. He said several holes are “more user-friendly” and several greens have more pin positions.He said he expects a similar winning score as in 2000, when Woods and runnerup Bob May each shot 18-under 270 in regulation. That’s because it’s hard to get the turf firm and fast in August in Louisville.As for the Ryder Cup, he said he expects players often shooting the equivalent of 66 to 68. He said the Centenary wasn’t “intended to be a back-breaking” course but can play difficult in bad weather conditions."

Outgoing chief of staff of the AFP, General Emmanuel Bautista, will turn over his position to incoming AFP chief of staff General Gregorio Pio Catapang. AFP PHOTO / NOEL CELIS (Photo credit should read NOEL CELIS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d0a6200000f90101d123.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Anyone familiar with Philippine politics will recognize the circus-like atmosphere that prevails on an ongoing basis, and how that often manifests itself in the judicial arena. We previously questioned whether the plunder charges leveled against former Philippine President Arroyo would ultimately stand, or be torn apart by a combination of evidentiary weakness or a corrupt judiciary. When in 2011 the House of Representatives voted to impeach then Chief Justice Corona, we noted that sometimes the Philippine government can actually get things right. Now the circus continues with the motion to impeach President Aquino, with opposition politicians having sharpened their knives in an attempt to draw some blood from the Teflon President.Last week, a number of impeachment complaints were lodged -- and are still being lodged -- against President Aquino, chiefly on the ground that he used the ""Disbursement Acceleration Program"" (DAP) as his own ""presidential pork barrel"". Pro-impeachment forces accused the President of using the DAP to ""bribe"", ""reward"", and ""favor"" politicians and allies, including Senator-judges who voted to convict then Chief Justice Corona in 2012. The impeachment complaints charge Aquino for culpable violation of the Constitution, ""usurping the power of the Legislature"", and for making a ""mockery of the principle of separation of powers"". The move to impeach the President gained traction on July 1st, when the Philippine Supreme Court voted 13-0 to declare the DAP partly unconstitutional for violating the doctrine of separation of powers. In particular, the Court declared void those portions of the DAP which allow ""cross-border transfers"" of ""savings"" of the Executive Department to augment various budgets of offices outside the Executive, as well as using these ""savings"" for the funding of projects and programs not covered by a specific appropriation in the national budget. The July decision followed a November 2013 ruling which declared unconstitutional the ""Priority Development Assistance Fund"" (PDAF), which authorized legislators to intervene in various post-enactment stages of budget execution of congressional pork barrel.In a speech last week, Aquino chastised the Court's partial declaration of unconstitutionality of the DAP, insisting it was done in all ""good faith"", with all the right intentions, and with the right results. Aquino pointed out that the DAP formed part of his economic stimulus package, and was predicated on the spending power of the government, traditionally reposed in the Executive Branch.   Strictly based on legal substance, the question of whether the President can ""augment"" existing projects and projects not found in the annual national budget, but which are expected to be implemented in the current year, remains ripe for judicial scrutiny. The DAP can arguably find a plausible foundation in statutory codes enabling the Executive department to flex its traditionally reposed spending power. Even without statutory formality, the DAP may arguably find basis in constitutional law. The DAP case is, in fact, still pending reconsideration at the Court.The more pressing problem for Aquino, however, is whether the House Committee on Justice --whose chair and members are known to be his staunch political allies and who led his impeachment drive against Corona -- would on one hand expectedly dismiss the string of complaints for being ""insufficient in form"" and ""in substance"", or on the contrary consolidate and endorse the impeachment complaints for consideration at the House plenary level. Once at the plenary, a favorable vote of one-third of all House members would be needed for the impeachment complaint to be elevated to the Senate. The Senate would then convene as the ""Impeachment Court"", with Senators sitting as ""Senator-jurors"" following American constitutional practice. Similar to American constitutional exceptionalism, under Philippine constitutional exceptionalism, whether the Committee on Justice or the lower House should vote for or against impeachment is ultimately a political question. Under a House, and with House committees, dominated by Aquino allies, it seems unlikely that any of the impeachment complaints will pass muster. Aquino is well supported by a majority in the Senate. For an impeachment bid to succeed, the official must first be impeached by the House -- under a ""one-third"" standard -- and then, after trial, convicted by the Senate -- under a ""two-thirds"" standard for conviction. Given that Aquino enjoys strong support from both the upper and lower houses of Congress, the entire bid to impeach him may be seen as an exercise in futility. Even staunch opposition congressmen in the House are reluctant to endorse the impeachment complaints, increasing in number through time, because it is no secret to them that even the House Secretariat will choose not to transmit the signed complaints to the House Justice Committee. So it seems that pro-impeachment forces are stuck with front desk politics. Given that political dynamics and the political tempo may drastically change when President Aquino delivers his fifth State of the Nation Address on Monday, we think that even while the numbers are in his favor, it may still be too early to tell. Public confidence and surveys show that Aquino's popularity ratings have dropped to an historical low. It could be that the tide of mass political opinion may rule the day. In addition, Aquino's chastisement of the Supreme Court decision was seen as an ill-timed institutional attack against the justice system, if not bordering on causing a constitutional crisis and constitutional standoff between the Executive and the Judiciary. Given the Court's recent decisions declaring void wholesale entrenched pork barrel systems (known under many names since the time of former President Marcos), the Court's social legitimacy is at an all-time high. This is especially so for a Court whose current Chief Justice is, or was, known to be an Aquino ally. Is the ""Rule of Law"" alive and well in the Philippines? We consider ""pristine"" Rule of Law to be too much to expect from a landscape that has historically been, and continues to be, politically charged. Impeachment and impeachment courts are not ""courts of justice"" in such a landscape, but they do form part of the larger system of checks and balances when the justice system is in system failure. While systemic 'injustice' is nowhere near what it used to be in the Philippines, system 'imperfections' remain entrenched.For a country now enjoying investment grade status -- largely attributable to the work done by President Aquino and his cabinet -- the current episode of the 'political circus' is a stark reminder that while some things have changed for the better in the Philippines, ""business as usual"" endures in some important parts of Philippine society. Historians may well look back at this unfortunate spectacle and wonder just how much has really changed in the new darling of the Asian foreign investment community. Whether this impeachment drive ends in failure may prove to be an objective litmus test for whether or not the Philippines deserves its investment grade rating, and indeed, whether that rating will endure when President Aquino's term ends.-- Edsel Tupaz teaches comparative law in Manila.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) explained in 2012 that, while he ""wasn't a scientist, man,"" he believed the age of Earth was ""one of the great mysteries."" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) similarly said earlier this year that he was ""not qualified to debate the science over climate change."" And Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) also used the line when asked whether he was worried that rising sea levels posed a threat to his coastal home.President Barack Obama made hay out of the line in June, slamming politicians who use it for failing to curb the harmful effects of carbon emissions.“Let me translate,"" he said in drought-stricken California. ""What that means is, ‘I accept that man-made climate change is real, but if I admit it, I’ll be run out of town by a radical fringe that thinks climate science is a liberal plot.'""""I'm not a scientist either, but we've got some good ones at NASA,"" he added.Crist, who is a former Republican, currently leads Scott 45 percent to 40 percent in Florida’s hotly contested governor’s race, according to a new Quinnipiac University survey.
