One way we would not describe the Hollywood stylist: low-maintenance. But in a new interview with Women's Wear Daily, Zoe insists that she's, like, a total tomboy:  “On one hand I am this weird androgynous tomboy where I’m strangely low maintenance and have a five-minute makeup regimen.""Oh, really. Tell us more about this person who is obviously not Rachel Zoe:""On the other I’m obsessed with all things beauty, from skin care to makeup.”Sorry, not buying it. We've seen ""The Rachel Zoe Project,"" where Rachel jets to New York Fashion Week with racks and racks of clothing (very girly clothing, we might add); spends way more than five minutes getting her hair and makeup done by professionals before heading out into public; and stops to shop on approximately 1,947 occasions. We've also seen Rachel wear large quantities of makeup, so much that it couldn't possibly have been applied in five minutes or less.But hey, maybe Zoe is turning a corner with her new hair salon chain, DreamDry (the subject that had her musing on her beauty routine).

A little-known museum in New York City is doing a just that by offering hands-on school and family programs. I have taken my kids to many of these monthly events at The Center for Architecture. The Center has programs where families get to make (and keep) their own light fixtures, build a geodesic (in a group, out of 3 foot long straws and then individually, with marshmallows and toothpicks) and create a towering set of skyscrapers. Recently, we attended another classic -- building bridges. Our terrific instructor introduced the kids to a series of bridges -- the basic beam bridge, the truss -- made up of triangles, the Roman arch and the suspension bridge. And then it was time for the real fun to begin. The Center provides an endless array of building materials for the kids to use and they dived into piles of cardboard boxes, wooden rods, toothpicks, corks, bottle caps, string, colored cellophane and glitter. As everyone knows, a solid Roman arch looks better when it is covered in blue glitter. Mine certainly did. The Center's volunteers were on hand to help with kids with structural advice. The children learned by trial and error just how hard it is to glue toothpicks together and why is might make more sense to build with a bigger base. Budding engineers and architects unwittingly learned about physics, aesthetics and patience. The program is a great way for a family to work together on a project. It turns out that parents love the chance to build things as much as kids do. Another bonus, besides the relatively low-tech slide show, the Center's building zone was tech-free and for a few brief hours, it was as if video games had never been created. Family programs are relatively inexpensive -- $20 for a family of four, but they do fill up fast. Anyone who lives in New York or is planning a trip should jump on the chance to visit this downtown treasure. After the family program, spend a few minutes walking through the exhibit space. The current exhibit is devoted to optimal school designs and is entitled: ""Building Great Schools."" Kids can see how it feels to sit at the coolest school desk in town. http://www.cfafoundation.org/"

Chase:My hands were busy through the day, I didn't have much time to play The little games you asked me to, I didn't have much time for you.It made such an impression I recopied it in my own handwriting and put it in a scrapbook filled with similar tales of grownup regrets I was determined to avoid. The most important regret? Not appreciating kids while they were little. I didn't know a single person who felt like he'd savored that time of life.Well, except for one. His parenting advice was simple: ""Make lots of memories.""Many years later I went on a date with a guy who told me the memory he most cherished of his late mother was falling asleep to the sound of her laughter. I couldn't stop thinking about that. I didn't know if I was going to be a mom, but I knew what kind of mom I wanted to be.Many years after that I read an essay by Anna Quindlen in Newsweek, and committed this excerpt to the end of a computer file I added to constantly -- so if I didn't read it in the course of adding a new entry I'd at least have to mouse over it...""The biggest mistake I made is the one that most of us make. I did not live in the moment enough. This is particularly clear now that the moment is gone, captured only in photographs. There is one picture of the three of them sitting in the grass on a quilt in the shadow of the swing set on a summer day, ages six, four, and one. And I wish I could remember what we ate, and what we talked about, and how they sounded, and how they looked when they slept that night. I wish I had not been in such a hurry to get on to the next thing: dinner, bath, book, bed. I wish I had treasured the doing a little more and the getting it done a little less.""By now I was a mom, and I had a recipe for doing it right. The last two lines from the poem I just mentioned became ""I wish I could go back and do the little things you asked me to"" and they played in my head constantly. When I was tempted to tell Katie no -- or sometimes even after I had -- I almost always reversed that decision. She wasn't asking me to turn my back on my values, after all -- whatever it was represented a minor inconvenience, and I was not going to be the woman in the poem.And sure, it became a joke between Katie and me. She started using it on me before it occurred to me to use it. There are worse things to show a child, though -- a determination to say no only when you have a good reason.For a while I started racing through our bedtime routines in an attempt to get everyone a good night's sleep. ""To heck with that,"" I decided, eventually. I was determined, like Anna wished she would've been, to treasure the doing a little more and the getting it done a little less. Now I measure the success of a day by how many giggles there are as it winds down. Katie makes it easy. She teases us in a Russian accent, and soon we're doubled over with laughter. Is Robin Williams this funny when he gets going? I doubt it. But part of what made Robin who he is, I remember reading, was the delight he felt at making his mother laugh.Katie falls asleep to the sound of my laughter, knowing she's 100 percent responsible.It's been such a privilege, watching her grow up. She puts on a good show.But me? I'm a good audience. And that's what makes me a good mom."

The three-day World Yoga Conference on the theme ‘Global Peace and Harmony through Holistic Approach of Yoga and Meditation’ will host over 300 delegates from different countries. AFP PHOTO/ STR (Photo credit should read STRDEL/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cee191f00005000216aec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When you see a young, lithe body bending into challenging yoga postures, it's easy to assume that they were just born that way. New students sometimes quit because they lose faith that they'll ever be able to bend their bodies into yoga asana perfection. But yoga is a path of effort that requires years of dedication. Some of the best teachers are the ones who struggled the most along the way. The most intense and arduous journey makes a more salient and dramatic story to tell upon its completion. Success in yoga is not measured by the advanced postures -- it's measured by the depth of the inner process. The best yogis are the ones who master not just the physical acrobatics but also the mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of the practice.It's too easy to say that everyone who can lift up into handstand, bend deeply backward or places both legs behind their head is naturally gifted. If that were true, you would be either blessed or cursed from birth. Yoga is about the inner journey and even those lucky few with natural talent need to put in the work to reach their maximum potential. Excellence demands a certain minimum level of practice before its can be expressed. Researchers who studied aptitude ultimately settled on the magic number of 10,000 hours as a minimum for determining expertise in a given field.Neurologist Daniel Levitin says ""the emerging picture from such studies is that 10,000 hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert-in anything. In study after study, of composers, basketball players, fiction writers, ice skaters, concert pianists, chess players, master criminals, and what have you, this number comes up again and again... No one has yet found a case in which true world-class expertise was accomplished in less time. It seems that it takes the brain this long to assimilate all that it needs to know to achieve true mastery...This is true even of people we think of as prodigies.""   Even if you're born naturally flexible you still have to practice to let those gifts flourish and reach the level of mastery. Without dedication, devotion and hard work over many years; natural talent will remain untapped. Many people point to the musical genius of Mozart, who started composing at the age of six. Some of his ""early"" pieces were actually written while he was in his teens after he had been writing music for more than 10 years. And his magnum opus was composed on his death bed, the culmination of a lifetime of concentrated study, practice and dedication. With yoga practice it would take more than a few practice sessions to reach the 10,000-hour point. If you assume two hours a day, six days a week and then factor in all the days of when you did not make it to the mat, you would need almost 20 years to get to 10,000 practice hours. Of course, some students practice for three hours every day and others even practice twice a day and do technique workshops to explore yoga asana in the afternoon. This would accelerate the time it takes to reach the 10,000 hour level. Maybe the best teachers wait for their students to reach the equivalent of 10,000 hours of experience before giving them the authority to teach. My teacher, Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, asked students of Ashtanga Yoga to make at least eight trips of around six months each to Mysore, India before considering them for the highly level of qualification, Certification. This honor was not given to many students of Ashtanga Yoga and those who did receive it certainly put in the work.The practice of yoga is a great equalizer. Pure practice is the determinant of whether you will succeed. It doesn't matter if you're naturally flexible or strong if you sit on the sofa and watch TV all day. It matters that you get on your yoga mat and start practicing today. Once you reach a certain level of realization through dedicated practice, you have the fruits of your labor to share and are then qualified to teach what you know from direct experience. So many people assume that I was a gymnast, a dancer or just naturally gifted when they see my regular practice of the Ashtanga Yoga Advanced Series. I was never a gymnast or a dancer, nor was I naturally gifted. I had a little more natural flexibility when I started but nothing like what I can do today after 14 years of practice. The first time I tried to put my leg behind my head, it didn't go, and the first time I tried to stand up from backbend I hit my head on the ground. When I tried to lift-up in any strength posture I faced the fact that I was a weakling who could not lift any part of my body off the ground. It's through years of practice, both through my traditional practice and many afternoon technique sessions, that I have the strength and flexibility in my practice today. If I can do it anyone can. The only difference is a few years and a few thousand hours on the yoga mat. The benefit of yoga isn't something that materializes out of thin air. You have to work for it and then you receive its grace.For more by Kino MacGregor, click here. For more on yoga, click here. "

Easels are a great way to display larger pieces and canvases because they can support a lot of weight and hold unusual shapes. Wood easels aren't that cheap, so opt for aluminum if you're trying to cut costs.5. Lean It  If you have an unframed canvas or a matted print, leaning them along a shelf or the floor is a great option.

And it was a five-Kleenex affair.  My mirror neurons, the ones that make you match the emotions of others, were hard at work. (You know when someone yawns, and then you yawn? Those are your mirror neurons.) But the tsunami of tears I experienced went beyond sympathy or empathy.  They started when his children and then his wife spoke about their father/husband. Each of the kids, now grown and launched, shared what she/he would remember most about her/his dad. Each echoed the same sentiment: Their dad modeled for them how to be a person of character; he walked the walk, even when no one was looking. (He penalized himself for a golf stroke even though only he knew about it.) He lived a life of integrity, caring, action, love and devotion. He didn't preach it; he lived it.But the thing expressed by each child that brought me to my knees, was that this dad was genuinely there for each of kids throughout their lives. Each not only felt, but experienced his/her dad's concern, support and encouragement. He was an ongoing, constant, day-to-day presence in his kids' lives. They knew that he put them first not by his words but by his actions. This was a dad who showed up. He ""posted,"" as my kids would say.There are lots of scheduled ways that parents ""show up"" -- performances, culminations, sporting events. And there are more basic demands that require a parent to show up -- carpools, doctors' appointments, parent conferences. It was clear to me that these five children who lost their dad were talking about another kind of showing up, not the have-tos and not the splashy vacations and trips to Disneyland. They remembered their day-to-day, everyday dad.There are lots of competitors for a parent's attention in today's world. Everyone has obligations and distractions that tug them away from their children. A client and I recently shared the head-shaking reality that young children today must compete with their parents' ever-present, iPhones for attention. Whether waiting in carpool, in the ball park bleachers or standing in line at the grocery store, parents check emails with their children in tow. In the days before cell phones, parents actually watched their children in the park, witnessing the first real cartwheel or free throw, tiny events they would have missed had they been glued to their email. It takes pleas of ""Watch me, Daddy!"" to grab the parent's attention away from the iPhone these days. Do you think your kids don't notice what is most important to you?On the way home from the funeral, I listened to a radio show psychologist as she talked to a teenage boy who was acting out, mainly with his dad, as reported by the mom. Mom handed the phone to the boy, as per the doctor's request. After some noodling around, the doctor asked him, ""What do you want from your dad?"" ""I want him to him to like me. I want him to care about me and pay attention to me,"" the boy very quietly replied. How timely that I tuned into that segment on that day.How you will be remembered? What your children will say about you is in your hands. Take the time now to watch their cartwheels. The time to show up for your kids is now."

But just an hour and a half away from New York City lies Mohonk Mountain Lodge, a retreat surrounded by thousands of acres of wilderness, and the chance to get away from it all. We decided to try it for part of winter break. The obvious takeaway is that one way to get everyone up and moving is to have all activities nearby and not charge extra for any of them. At Mohonk, everything is within trudging distance, and all activities and equipment are included with the price of a room. Meals and snacks are also included.  On our first morning there, my kids and I strapped on cross-country skis and hit the resort's trails. My 9-year old twins were novices and despite a few off-track excursions, slowly got the hang of it. With 85 miles of trails, it is possible to spend hours exploring. We took a break for a hearty buffet lunch. Next on our agenda was ice skating. That was another new activity for my kids. They each took a lesson and then spent the afternoon practicing. The adjacent outdoor fireplace was the perfect place for a hot chocolate break. Unbelievably, no one requested a turn on my iPhone. As it started to get dark, we went inside for cookies and board games. Not surprisingly, we were pretty tired after dinner, but instead of zoning out in front of the TV, we watched the fire in our room die down then come to life with added kindling. (All hotel rooms are TV-free).On our second morning, we once again went ice skating, which was turning into a new favorite activity. At least, it was until we went snowshoeing. This time, I asked the friendly guy who fitted us for snow shoes for a recommended route. He sent us to a spot behind the mountain house where we did not see another person, but did spot a deer. The cold did eventually get the better of us. My boys spent their last few hours in the old-fashioned game room -- think foosball -- with a couple of other cheerful kids. Other wholesome late afternoon options included bingo.Now we just need to figure out how to keep the activity level going while at home. I have already checked out all the local ice rink options, but will not be as motivated unless someone is cooking all my family's meals."

Plump, who's dealt with infidelity from both sides -- as the betrayer and the betrayed -- wonders why more couples don't put in the work to mend their marriages after an affair.""It is a rare spouse who never, for one moment, considers the tidal pull of another. That consideration is painful for both, even if nothing happens,"" she writes. ""But when it does happen, does it really need to be fatal? Having been through both ends of adultery, I think divorce is a lot worse than recovering from a spouse's affair. I do not think there should be more infidelity. I just think there should be less divorce because of it."" But how possible is it for couples to recover after one partner cheats?

'Food Reporters' is a culinary social network accessible via a smartphone application and a website.

At one point in the meal, everyone in my six-person group was furiously typing out a message to someone not at the table. We were social zombies, alone together. I wondered why we even bothered showing up, when eating alone at home would've had the same effect.The restaurant staff seemed to be having the same issue as our table: In between taking wine orders and clearing tables, servers and busboys sneaked quick peeks at their phones. Restaurant managers, understandably, don't take kindly to this, creating a game of digital cat and mouse. Given the grip our phones have on our lives, how can we possibly un-tether ourselves? A possible solution can be found in E.M. Forster's 1909 science fiction story ""The Machine Stops,"" which provides an early vision to what today's mobile Web would become. He describes an uninhabitable Earth where people are confined to individual pods and provided all of their bodily needs via an omnipotent Machine. Instead of hunting and gathering, they devote time to communicating thoughts and ideas via the Machine's ""speaking apparatus.""There's one key difference that stands out between Forster's century-old dystopian vision and how we live in 2013: His pods came equipped with an ""isolation button,"" which turned off all communication save for one conversation, allowing the inhabitant to focus on the present. This simple act of intimacy, focusing on one person or one conversation at a time, has largely been lost with the widespread adoption of smartphones. Family dinners are lost to email and teenage texting. Vacations, once the archetype of disconnection, are spent checking how many likes that horseback riding photo has garnered. Smartphones are incredibly useful and convenient for navigating our lives, but the boundaries of their usefulness have been lost. In order to focus on the world in front of us instead of the world in our pockets and purses, we need an isolation button. Disconnecting from our phones would help us reclaim space and time that's been eaten up by a stream of texts, calls and notifications. Imagine enjoying an evening at home free from the distraction of work email, or a date uninterrupted by someone retweeting the photo you just tweeted of the kale Caesar salad with pugliese croutons. Unfortunately, deciding to disconnect is just half the battle. Truly ""checking out"" requires that your friends, family, and colleagues know that you're unreachable and to respect your privacy. This is a big challenge when the purchase of many new phones comes with the condition of reachability attached. This may be the original sin of cellphone addiction. Companies give their employees phones with the implicit assumption that they always be reachable. Being ""always on"" is then seen as a badge of honor, locking employees in competition to send emails at the oddest possible hour of the night. Who hasn't received an inconsequential email at 3 in the morning? What ever happened to sleep, and to the great unicorn of work-life balance?Unfortunately for us, ""always on"" now extends past the factory gates. Our social lives have been invaded by high expectations of communication. People who don't reliably respond to calls or text are tagged as flaky at best, and sketchy at worst. How does this leave any room for focusing on the present? Personal time and space seem to have evaporated into thin air.   Changing social norms to make disconnecting from our phones socially acceptable will take some work, but the benefits to be won are clear. Taking ownership of our time, rather than taking orders from a smartphone, will allow us time to think and roam free. Once un-tethered from the digital leash, we may find our self-induced ADD melting away. Our work, our friendships, our stress levels will all thank us. We can own the upside of a smartphone's convenience without the downside of being always on call. I'm ready for an isolation button.
