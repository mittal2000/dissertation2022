0,POLITICS,Two DNC Vice-Chairs Push For Additional Primary Debates,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-additional-primary-debates_us_55f1ae1de4b002d5c0785f77,Because of democracy and stuff.,2015-09-10,"<p>Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) addresses the summer meeting of the Democratic National Committee, Aug. 28, 2015, in Minneapolis.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The American political process is, as we all know, an interminable parade of shame and desperation. But the current election cycle has been made a little more bearable thanks to the (relatively) limited number of primary season debates. The Republican National Committee has kept that number somewhere within the realm of rational thought -- they'll have at most 12 debates, and perhaps as few as nine. Their counterparts at the Democratic National Committee have gone a similar route, scheduling six debates beginning in October. This is a substantial improvement over previous election seasons, in which it was common to have debates on a near-weekly basis.Obviously, the decision not to murder the American people with constant debate-bludgeoning is a net benefit to society. But wherever there's a gathering of nonviable presidential candidates, there will also be a loud call for additional debates, since it's the core belief of every candidate polling at 1 percent that if they could just have a bunch of free media appearances -- say, five or 10 more debates, no big deal! -- they could execute their master plan and maybe end up polling at 5 percent. Or even 6!So it's no big surprise that over on the Democratic side, where there is one viable candidate (Hillary Clinton) and one viable challenger (Bernie Sanders), we're seeing a demand from other folks in the field -- namely, those who are trying right now to outpoll perennial favorite ""Margin of error"" -- to have more debates, more opportunities, more, more, more. On Wednesday, a pair of Democratic National Committee vice-chairs, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and former Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, released a statement badgering DNC head Debbie Wasserman Schultz about this very issue. As Maggie Haberman reports for The New York Times:The party committee’s “decision to limit Presidential candidates to 6 debates, with a threat of exclusion for any candidate who participates in any non-DNC sanctioned debate, is a mistake,” Ms. Gabbard and Mr. Rybak wrote in their statement.In an argument that ""echoes a speech given at the party’s summer meeting in Minnesota by [former Maryland governor, Democratic primary also-ran and totally not the inspiration for anyone on 'The Wire' Martin] O’Malley,"" the two call for ""several more debates than the six currently scheduled"" and ask the DNC to relax the rules that currently ban Democratic candidates from the official debates if they participate in any non-sanctioned events.But as The Hill's Jonathan Easley reported Thursday, Wasserman Schultz has declared the debate over debates to be over:Speaking at a breakfast with reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, Wasserman Schultz, who has been under fire by Democratic presidential candidates and some within the DNC, said the debate schedule was final and there would be no changes.Sanders also called for more debates earlier this summer, saying, ""At a time when many Americans are demoralized about politics and have given up on the political process, I think it’s imperative that we have as many debates as possible."" But as Time's Sam Frizell reported in August, the Vermont senator ""has rebuffed at least one TV outlet's efforts"" to draw him into an unsanctioned debate. It's not hard to guess why Sanders would do this: It doesn't really benefit him to sit in a room with a handful of candidates who are barely scraping by in the polls. Per Frizell:“It is not in Sanders’ self-interest to give up the possibility of debating Hillary Clinton,” said Kathleen Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “His advantage is to be in the same stage as her, demonstrating that he can hold his own. He is doing well enough in the polls that forgoing that would be foolish.”Never let it be said that Sanders isn't capable of cold-blooded political calculus! We should note an irony: Back in 2008, when she was the candidate in desperate need of oxygen, Clinton was the one calling for more debates -- and running attack ads against then-Sen. Barack Obama for ducking them.Sanders, Gabbard and Rybak notwithstanding, it would appear that the door has been shut on additional debates, leaving O'Malley alone with his complaints about the process and his accusations about the system being ""rigged"" in Clinton's favor. Which, to be fair, is a reasonable suspicion! As Jim Newell noted at Salon in May, ""it’s not unfair to describe the Democratic National Committee as an informal adjunct of the Hillary Clinton campaign. She is the establishment front-runner -- the most establishment-y front-runner there has been in the modern era in either party, really -- and the Democratic National Committee is quite literally the Democratic Party establishment.""So no, it's probably not a coincidence that the current, limited debate schedule works out in Clinton's favor. Of course, she's been doing pretty well at the whole ""win the support of influential party elites"" thing, plus the ""claim an overwhelming advantage with party donors"" thing -- and maybe once you dominate those competitions, you don't really need Debbie Wasserman Schultz to help you further by arranging a debate schedule that gives your competitors few opportunities to shine. Perhaps that's why Clinton's campaign has ""in recent days... suggested that she would be open to having more debates if that’s what the party committee decides to do,"" according to Haberman.Then again, there's the distinct possibility that maybe O'Malley is just not great at the whole ""being an appealing presidential candidate"" thing. O'Malley's current poll average is 1.1 percent. He's never been within 40 points of Clinton, and the last time he was within single digits of Sanders was June 14. For a guy who's only doing slightly better at running for president than I am, how many extra debates is it going to take to fix this? "

They have reportedly doubled their weight on a diet of herring and other fish -- Pearl weighing in at nearly 135 pounds and Hermes at 156 -- and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration monk seal research team is now gearing up to re-release them in the wild later this month.

The bill is part of a wider effort to give Americans released from prison a better shot at re-entering society. The Fair Chance Act echoes growing nationwide support to ""ban the box,"" where applicants must check on an application whether they have a criminal record. At least 70 million Americans qualify to some degree. The idea behind the movement is that employers should consider an applicant's merits without the stigma of a conviction. At least 18 states have already taken action on the issue and a number of private companies, including Walmart and Koch Industries Inc., have voluntarily joined the movement.The legislative effort is led by Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) in the Senate and Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) in the House.""Once you get that criminal history, it's like a life sentence,"" Cummings said at a press conference Thursday. He cited the statistic that men who report convictions are 50 percent less likely to receive a callback or job offer, with the rate being even higher for African-American men.The bill bars federal agencies from asking about a person's criminal history before a conditional job offer is made, with some exceptions, such as for law enforcement. Agencies would be prohibited from asking people bidding for government contracts to disclose their criminal records in advance of an award decision. Government contractors would, in turn, be subject to similar requirements.According to the National Employment Law Project, the Office of Personnel Management encourages federal agencies to wait until the end of the hiring process before considering a criminal record, but the reality is that agencies have ""broad discretion"" in their practices with ""limited accountability and transparency.""Ruthie Epstein, a legislative policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the bill would create ""an enduring model for hiring practices across the country"" and ""transform the way employers conduct hiring for people with records."" Her organization urged President Barack Obama to adopt fair chance hiring practices, and she said the bill indicates that the president ""has the political space to match his rhetoric with action.""Cummings told The Huffington Post that Obama could take executive action on this issue and ""will probably,"" but the lawmakers want to make sure they codify these kinds of policies. At the press conference in support of the bill, Issa quoted former President Ronald Reagan -- who is often blamed for skyrocketing incarceration rates -- as saying, ""The best social program is a job.""""There will be people who say, 'Well, can we take this chance?'"" Issa added. Given how many Americans have a criminal record, he said, ""We have to take a chance.""Booker said, ""Job applicants deserve to be assessed on their skills and qualifications and merits, not their worst mistakes.""Also on HuffPost:"

All six officers will now face individual trials for the charges brought against them by State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby.However, the court will still need to decide if an impartial jury can be seated in Baltimore, The Baltimore Sun reported.Gray, 25, suffered a severe spinal cord injury after being taken into custody by Baltimore police on April 12. The officers' attorneys wanted the trials moved out of the city over concerns that their clients would not receive fair trials there, due to the amount of media coverage Gray’s death received and the impact it could have on jurors.Since a jury is culled from a cross-section of the community where the trial takes place, the location of a trial can have an effect on its outcome.""Rural and suburban juries are less likely to connect to the community conditions and more likely to excuse police as having a tough job and doing what is needed,"" Dennis Kenney, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told The Huffington Post.In general, Kenney added, most juries tend to side with the police unless they find the officers' behavior unjustifiable. ""This case could be one of those, depending on the facts,"" he said.A change of venue can increase the likelihood that a jury will be impartial, according to Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University. Medwed also noted that if the officers were to be convicted outside of Baltimore, they would not be able to argue on appeal that they had not received a fair trial. ""On the other hand, the people of Baltimore are the victims, along with Freddie Gray, and have a compelling reason to hear the case; they are the injured community,"" Medwed said.Outside the courthouse Thursday morning, a smattering of demonstrators carried signs demanding the trial be held in Baltimore.Williams' ruling on Thursday comes the day after a Baltimore city board approved a $6.4 million settlement in a separate civil case, which Gray's family brought against the city. During a news conference on Wednesday, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said the decision to settle is intended to bring ""an important measure of closure"" to the Gray family, to the community and to the city.""I again want to extend my most sincere condolences to the family of Mr. Freddie Gray,"" Rawlings-Blake said.The mayor acknowledged that the decision to settle the civil claim prior to a decision in the criminal case is ""unusual,"" but emphasized that it is not an indication that the city suspects the officers of wrongdoing. Lt. Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police, called the settlement decision a ""ridiculous reaction."" He added that it ""threatens to interrupt any progress made toward restoring the relationship"" between cops and the city government.The mayor disagreed.""The city’s decision to settle the civil case should not be interpreted as passing any judgment on guilt or innocence of the officers,"" Rawlings-Blake said, arguing that the settlement is in the best interests of the city’s taxpayers. It’s also one of the largest police brutality-related settlements Baltimore has seen in years. According to a Baltimore Sun analysis from last year, the combined amount paid by the city in all police brutality settlements between 2011 and 2014 was roughly $5.7 million.Kenney argued that while the settlement is not proof of guilt, it is suggestive.""Clearly, the city had custody of him and he died. By definition, the city has fault,"" he said. ""That doesn’t, however, serve as proof that he was murdered.""Medwed suspects that prospective jurors may improperly infer from the settlement that the city is admitting that the officers did something wrong. In fact, however, it's difficult to reach any conclusion about the decision to settle since, as Rawlings-Blake suggested, it can simply be a matter of city business. Nevertheless, it could affect the point of view of potential jurors. ""It is another thumb on the scale in favor of the defense argument that the [jury] is tainted,"" Medwed said. Autopsy reports indicated that Gray sustained a single “high-energy injury,” likely caused by what prosecutors have called a “rough ride” in the back of the police van where Gray was handcuffed and rode without being secured by a seat belt. The injury, according to the autopsy, was likely caused by the van decelerating rapidly. After spending a week in a coma, Gray died on April 19. While state medical examiners acknowledged that the death fit the “medical and legal definition of an accident,” they still ruled it a homicide due to the police's failure to follow proper safety protocols “through acts of omission.""  The Baltimore Police Department admitted in April that Gray did not receive timely medical care after he was arrested and was not buckled into his seat while being transported. Still, many details about what happened to Gray before and after his arrest remain unclear.Protests erupted in the city following Gray’s funeral on April 27. By May 1, Mosby had announced criminal charges against the six officers involved in Gray’s arrest. A grand jury indicted all six officers later that month.The officers face a range of charges. Most seriously, Officer Caesar Goodson, who drove the van used to transport Gray, is charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder, as well as manslaughter, two counts of vehicular manslaughter and second-degree assault.Sgt.

6,SPORTS,California Legislature Approves Ban On 'Redskins' Mascots,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-ban-redskins-mascots_us_55f03daee4b002d5c07760bd,Four high schools would have to choose a new mascot under legislation passed Thursday.,2015-09-10,<p>A group protests the name of the Washington Redskins across from an NFL game at San Francisco's Levi's Stadium in 2014.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The California State Assembly voted Thursday to ban the state's schools from using ""Redskins"" nicknames and mascots, a move that could soon make it the first state to specifically prohibit schools from using the name that continues to spark controversy across the nation.The California Racial Mascots Act, which Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D) introduced in December, would force four of the state's high schools that still use the name to change it by the start of 2017.The state Senate approved the bill in a 25-10 vote Tuesday evening, sending it back to the Assembly for final approval Thursday. The Assembly, which had approved a slightly different version of the bill in May, voted 59-9 to pass it. The legislation will now go to the desk of Gov. Jerry Brown (D).""As the state with the largest Native American population in the country, we should not continue to allow a racial slur to be used by our public schools,"" Alejo said in a press release. ""It's time for California to do the right thing and phase out the use of this, dictionary defined, racial slur.""Though California would be the first to specifically ban ""Redskins"" should Brown sign the bill, other states have sought similar policies in the past. Minnesota's board of education recommended that its schools stop using Native American mascots in 1988, and the New York state board of education later followed, as Native American activists and organizations argued that the nicknames perpetuated stereotypes that are harmful to their communities and students. (The American Psychological Association and American Sociological Association also recommended dropping such names for the same reason.)The national debate surrounding the Washington NFL team's use of the name has renewed that movement in recent years. Oregon is now in the process of implementing a law passed in 2012 that sought to phase out most Native American mascots at the state's schools, and Brown's signature would add the four California high schools to a list of at least eight others -- including schools in New York, Texas and Oklahoma -- that have stopped using “Redskins” in the last three years.Amid the controversy, Washington's NFL team has continued its fight to save its name. The Change The Mascot campaign, a joint effort of the Oneida Indian Nation of New York and the National Congress of American Indians that has targeted Washington’s football team for using the term, said California’s action should put further pressure on the franchise and the NFL to act.""This milestone is a major victory for everyone continuing the fight to bring an end to the use of this demeaning epithet in California and all across the country,” Change The Mascot’s leaders said. “Faced with this latest development, the National Football League must now try to reconcile how it can keep defending the use of a racial slur that the most populous state in the country, which is also home to three of the league’s teams, deems too offensive for its own public school system.” The NFL also received renewed pressure from Congress on Thursday, when Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) introduced legislation that would strip the league's exemption from federal antitrust laws as long as it allows Washington to continue using ""Redskins.""This post has been updated with the final vote count and a statement from Assemblyman Luis Alejo."

The police then tackled and temporarily detained Blake, causing him to suffer cuts and bruises as a result of the incident.Bratton has called the alleged incident “very disturbing” and said Blake “has a right to be upset about it.” The NYPD’s Internal Affairs division has since begun an investigation, and one of the officers involved in the incident has been placed on modified assignment. Bratton wants to apologize to Blake personally. “I will not tolerate any type of excessive use of force on the part of my police,” Bratton declared Wednesday.But during an interview on CNN’s “New Day” Thursday morning, Bratton had a different, more defiant message to impart -- one that should rightfully worry any person of color in New York City, as well as all their family and friends. ""Sorry, race has nothing at all to do with this,"" he said.""If you look at the photograph of the suspect, it looks like the twin brother of Mr. Blake. So let's put that nonsense to rest right now,” he added.In response, we say: Sorry Bratton, you can’t say race has nothing to do with this, and we can’t put it to rest right now.You can say you don’t think race played a factor, or that you think it’s unlikely it did. You can say that you don’t think the cops are racist, or that the police officers don’t think race played a role in the issue. That would all be, if not fine, at least justifiable.But to dismiss outright any and all concerns that race played a role in NYPD police officers tackling a black man who was once the No. 4 tennis player in the world -- that you cannot do.Blake, who has a black father and white mother, has downplayed the role race played in the incident, instead choosing to focus on the tactics employed by the officers.“To me it’s as simple as unnecessary police force, no matter what my race is,” Blake said in his initial conversation with The New York Daily News. “In my mind there’s probably a race factor involved, but no matter what, there’s no reason for anybody to do that to anybody.” There is no way to definitively state race played a factor. But the likelihood is high enough to necessitate the discussion Bratton doesn't want. Every day, implicit racial biases guide our interactions, police officers included. They alter how we talk to people of other races, how we view them and treat them, especially in moments of crisis.To act like they don't exist is not only lazy, it is dangerous and a recipe for flawed policy, especially when you run the police department of the country's largest city.Study after study has shown how these implicit racial biases shape us. Just last month, the Pew Research Center released evidence that nearly half of white people have a subconscious bias toward other white people. A study published in the the American Economic Review in 2005 noted that 61 studies together found a tangible link between these implicit bias and how we act.There are many more examples of such implicit biases too. Studies have found that “an ambiguous shove” is seen as more violent if the shover is black rather than white. They have found people are more likely to shoot an unarmed black person than an unarmed white person and that they are also less likely to shoot a white armed person than a black armed person. They have found an all-white jury is much more likely to convict a black defendant than a white defendant, and that white people judge black people’s résumés more harshly.There is also evidence that police officers are prone to use excessive force against black youths in particular. A study published last year in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology asked police officers, most of whom were white and male, to take a number of tests related to implicit bias. The researchers found that officers on average wanted to use much more force against black youths than white or Latino youths. Then, there's Bratton’s “twin brother” comment. Multiple studies have shown that people of one race have more difficulty distinguishing people of another race than they do their own. This bias, known as the other-race or cross-race effect, could easily guide not just Bratton’s assessment, but those of the officers and co-operating witnesses.In The New York Times earlier this year, the economist Sendhil Mullainathan discussed how moments of panic -- like, say, running to arrest an alleged criminal -- can lead to some of our most prejudiced decisions.“To use the language of the psychologist Daniel Kahneman, we think both fast and slow,” Mullainathan wrote. “When deciding what iPod to buy or which résumé to pursue, we weigh a few factors deliberately (‘slow’). But for hundreds of other factors, we must rely on intuitive judgment -- and we weigh these unconsciously (‘fast’).”“Even if, in our slow thinking, we work to avoid discrimination, it can easily creep into our fast thinking,” he added. “Our snap judgments rely on all the associations we have -- from fictional television shows to news reports. They use stereotypes, both the accurate and the inaccurate, both those we would want to use and ones we find repulsive.”These biases are everywhere and in all of us, including within the officers who took down Blake on Wednesday. To ignore them, to not even discuss them, is to ignore the truth. And to admit them, or to at least admit they could exist, is not to admit to racism. It is to admit that the only way to reduce bias is to struggle with it.In 2013, Forest Whitaker was frisked down by a New York City deli employee who wrongly believed the Academy Award-winning actor had shoplifted. The following month, Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote in The New York Times about the inherent danger in “the idea that racism lives in the heart of particularly evil individuals, as opposed to the heart of a democratic society."" The lesson in these moments, Coates argued, is not that a single deli employee or police officer is prejudiced. It is that they aren't so different from many of us.For many white people, discussing racial prejudice is awkward and uncomfortable, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. In fact, it's the exact reason why we should. Also on HuffPost:"

Zero Wall Street executives were put behind bars. More than 1,000 bankers were convicted of crimes after the much smaller savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s.On Thursday, DOJ announced that the white-collar crime free-for-all was over.""Crime is crime,"" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said in a speech at New York University School of Law, according to prepared remarks. ""And it is our obligation at the Justice Department to ensure that we are holding lawbreakers accountable regardless of whether they commit their crimes on the street corner or in the board room.""The comments from Yates reflect a new DOJ memo, first reported by The New York Times, instructing federal prosecutors to take a harder line with white-collar criminals. Because the statute of limitations has expired for most securities crimes committed ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, DOJ's course correction still won't hit the bankers and executives whose activity fueled the worst recession since the Great Depression.""One of the biggest mistakes our government made after the financial crisis was not prosecuting the people responsible for the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior that crashed our economy and ruined the lives of millions of Americans,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) told HuffPost in a statement. ""It is not acceptable that many young people have criminal records for smoking marijuana, while the CEOs of banks whose illegal behavior helped destroy our economy do not.""Failing to prosecute Wall Street crime isn't just a matter of fairness. Weakening or eliminating individual accountability for financial wrongdoing encourages bankers and traders to take bigger risks, particularly when the upside to an illegal maneuver could be millions of dollars in profits.""Better late than never, but what an insult to the American people,"" said Dennis Kelleher, referring to the DOJ memo. Kelleher is president and CEO of Better Markets, a financial reform watchdog.""With DOJ, words mean nothing,"" Kelleher warned. ""Based on their past dereliction of duty, no one should believe anything DOJ says until they see actual, concrete and repeated prosecution of supervisors and executives at Wall Street's biggest, wealthiest and most politically connected too-big-to-fail banks.""Americans for Financial Reform also remains skeptical.""The real evidence of change will be future enforcement actions that include much greater accountability for individuals,"" the bank watchdog group said in a statement.The new memo and Yates' accompanying speech effectively serve as an acknowledgement of DOJ's past hands-off attitude toward criminal banking, which has been an open secret in Washington for years. In March 2013, then-Attorney General Eric Holder even told Congress that some banks really were too big to jail.""When we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps world economy, that is a function of the fact that some of these institutions have become too large,"" Holder said before the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""It has an inhibiting impact on our ability to bring resolutions that I think would be more appropriate.""Though Holder quickly walked back those comments, DOJ's record reflected his original statement.For years after the financial crisis, apologists for big banks insisted that expansive deregulation dating back to the Clinton administration meant that a lot of bad behavior was not actually illegal. Those excuses were never very compelling. Predatory lending is illegal, and it's illegal for investment bankers to lie about the quality of the mortgage securities they sell. Insiders and experts have long said that such practices were common during the boom years of the early 2000s.But as a fresh set of banking scandals set in after the crisis, the notion that banks weren't being prosecuted because they weren't breaking the law fell apart. Banks inked settlement after settlement on a wide variety of serious charges. JPMorgan Chase settled charges that it illegally foreclosed on active-duty members of the military, manipulated energy markets and cheated borrowers with forged documents in foreclosure.As public pressure for justice intensified, banks began pleading guilty to felonies. Credit Suisse pleaded guilty in a tax evasion case. JPMorgan, Citigroup, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland pleaded guilty to manipulating interest rates.Yet these tougher actions were still aimed at the amorphous legal entity of the bank itself. Actual individuals who orchestrated and participated in the schemes did not face prosecution.Going easy on bankers didn't create career problems for those at DOJ. Botching a very high-profile case in 2012 did little to impede the prospects of its prosecutor. Loretta Lynch, who was then U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, opted not to press criminal charges against the world's second-largest bank, HSBC, even as she demanded a $1.9 billion payment under a ""deferred prosecution agreement"" -- effectively a settlement. HSBC had been accused of fudging on its anti-money laundering efforts to allow funds to flow to terrorists, drug traffickers and rogue regimes.During the investigation, the French government had turned over reams of documentation suggesting that HSBC had also been facilitating widespread tax evasion -- a scandal that finally made headlines in 2015. Lynch never went after the tax case. She was confirmed as U.S. attorney general in April, making her the country's top law enforcement official.The story has been updated with comment from Americans for Financial Reform."

As part of the settlement, Evans Bank agreed to expand its lending area to include the neighborhoods in question and to create an $825,000 fund to boost homeownership and lending in those areas.The state also accused Evans of refusing to solicit customers, market mortgages or provide banking facilities such as branch offices and ATMs in those areas.

I will not stand for it,"" he continued.Evans Bank disputed the underlying premise of the suit in a statement emailed to HuffPost, saying it was ""based upon unsubstantiated information.""""Regardless, Evans believes that this settlement is in the best interests of the community and our shareholders to end this unfortunate matter,"" David J. Nasca, the bank's president and chief executive, said in the statement.“We look forward to working with the Mayor and other organizations in these neighborhoods on projects and initiatives that will improve the quality of life and economic well-being of the community at large,” he added.

Berlin announced on Tuesday that ""after further investigation and the discovery of additional evidence,"" he has amended the charges against the suspect to include one count of a hate crime. Leaders at The Sikh Coalition were ""relieved"" to hear the news. “We are thankful that Robert Berlin and the DuPage County State’s Attorney’s Office have filed a hate crime charge in this case,” the Coalition’s Legal Director, Harsimran Kaur said in a statement. “For the Sikh American community, a formal hate crime charge was never about a harsher penalty, but instead prosecuting the crime for what it was. We can’t combat the problem of hatred against minority communities in America unless our elected officials and government agencies acknowledge that the problem exists.” UPDATE, September 11: On Friday, DuPage County State Attorney Robert B. Berlin announced that the suspect is being charged with aggravated battery and described the attack on Inderjit Singh Mukker as a ""road rage incident."" The Sikh Coalition called the statement ""shocking and completely unacceptable"" and demanded that the U.S. Department of Justice prosecute the attack as a hate crime. Requests for comment sent to Berlin were not answered. EARLIER: A Sikh-American man was brutally attacked and allegedly called a ""terrorist"" and ""Bin Laden"" in a Chicago suburb last Tuesday, Sikh advocacy groups report.The incident occurred just days before the 14th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Earlier statements from the DuPage State's Attorney's office indicated that the suspect would only be charged with aggravated battery. On Tuesday, Attorney Robert B. Berlin announced that the charges had been amended to include one count of a hate crime.According to the Sikh Coalition, Inderjit Singh Mukker, an American citizen and father of two, was on his way to a grocery store when a driver began taunting him. He finally pulled over to the side of the road to let him pass, but the driver instead pulled up in front of his car, reached into the car and repeatedly punched Mukker in the face. Mukker lost consciousness, lost blood and suffered a fractured cheekbone.The assailant also yelled racial slurs, including, ""Terrorist, go back to your country, Bin Laden!""Mukker was then rushed to a nearby hospital where he had to be sewn up with six stitches.""No American should be afraid to practice their faith in our country,"" Mukker said.The Sikh Coalition's Legal Director Harsimran Kaur said the group wanted the attack investigated as a hate crime.“We believe Mr. Mukker was targeted and assaulted because of his Sikh religious appearance, race or national origin,” Kaur said in a statement.Mukker also said that this attack needed to be considered a hate crime. ""I'm thankful for the authorities' swift response to apprehend the individual but without this being fully investigated as a hate crime, we risk ignoring the horrific pattern of intolerance, abuse and violence that Sikhs and other minority communities in this country continue to face,"" he said.Sikh groups have reported a surge of hate crimes against people in their community since the September 11 attacks. The U.S. Department of Justice has investigated more than 800 incidents against Sikh, Arab, Muslim and South Asian Americans since 9/11. Last August, Sandeep Singh, a Sikh father in New York City, was run over and dragged 30 feet after being called a ""terrorist.""In 2012, a gunman with Neo-Nazi ties walked into a Sikh house of worship (gurdwara) and shot and killed six innocent Sikh victims in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.Simran Jeet Singh, Senior Religion Fellow for the Sikh Coalition, wondered what it would take to end the ""disease"" of violence against religious minorities. The brutal attack on an elderly Sikh American is harrowing in its own right. It's even more troubling when we see it in the context of hate violence in modern America.

Of 134 people who were interviewed about what they ate in the week precedeing their death, 68 percent reported eating cucumbers. The cucumbers in question were sold from August 1 to September 3. Because of the potential health risk, all cucumbers distributed by the San Diego-based company Andrew and Williamson Fresh Produce are being recalled. It’s difficult to identify the cucumbers because they’re typically sold in bulk displays or sliced up in prepared salads.

The state health departments of Arizona, California, Montana and Nevada have been able to isolate Salmonella bacteria from cucumbers distributed by Andrew and Williamson Fresh Produce cucumbers. Salmonella is a type of bacteria that can cause diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramping. Symptoms set in about 12 to 72 hours after infection and last for four to seven days. Most people recover without needing treatment, but in people with suppressed immune systems, like the elderly or young children, the diarrhea can be so extreme that they need to be taken to the hospital and treated with antibiotics.

Right Wing Watch posted audio of the segment.""A clerk provides licenses to do something,"" Staver said. ""In this case, they're licensing... something that is directly contrary to the core of their religious convictions, to engage in sinful activity among same-sex relations, and sanction something that is contrary to the Scriptures, and that is marriage of two people of the same sex."" Rick Green, who co-hosts the program, prompted Staver to give an example of another ""activity... that would be un-biblical and violate [Davis'] beliefs"" if people asked for a license to do it.Staver replied that it would be similar to requiring a clerk ""to grant a license to engage in pornography, to grant a license to sodomize children or something of that nature ... that would be harmful to the people involved in the activity.""He also said that requiring Davis to issue same-sex marriage licenses would be like forcing a Jewish deli owner to serve pork or forcing someone to endorse a Ku Klux Klan rally.Staver said that same-sex couples who want to get a marriage license can easily get one elsewhere.""It's not that these people can't get a license. There's 130 offices in Kentucky,"" he said. ""They could go to a different county if they wanted to. Or, alternatively, they could go to a judge within the same county."" Davis was released from jail Tuesday and appeared briefly at a rally flanked by Staver and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R), who is also an opponent of same-sex marriage. Huckabee is one of more than a dozen Republicans seeking their party's presidential nomination.""She loves God, she loves people, she loves her work and she will not betray any of those three,"" Staver told reporters outside Carter County Detention Center in Grayson, Kentucky, on Tuesday. When Davis was jailed Thursday for refusing to issue marriage licenses, Staver compared her to the persecuted Jews in Nazi Germany.""They were evicted from public employment, then boycotted in their private employment, then stigmatized, and that led to the gas chambers,"" Staver told Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, during a radio show.U.S. District Judge David Bunning released Davis from jail after five of her six deputies began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.Although Bunning warned that Davis may not interfere with the duties of her deputy clerks, Staver told reporters that his client ""cannot and will not violate her conscience.""

Can you quote me the statute?"" Huckabee said.

His listeners were a crowd rallying in support of Kim Davis, the recalcitrant Kentucky county clerk just released from jail. Hopefully, they didn't believe what Huckabee told them.""We do not want this country to become the smoldering remains of what was once a great republic, where the people rule,"" the former Arkansas governor told the crowd. That vision of America should not be ""exchanged for a place where five unelected lawyers think that they can rule,"" he said.""We're here to say, 'No, they cannot,'"" Huckabee declared. He was referring to the Supreme Court's June decision finding that gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to marry. Davis has famously -- or infamously -- opposed that ruling in her refusal to issue marriage licenses to all comers in Rowan County. Huckabee's mention of ""five unelected lawyers"" was borrowed from the landmark decision itself. In his dissenting opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the ""five lawyers"" -- otherwise known as his fellow justices -- who ruled in favor of gay couples ""have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law.""""Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept,"" Roberts wrote.It's not clear that a more majoritarian process, such as the Kentucky state legislature passing a law, would have persuaded Davis to go along with the new legal reality. But not even the Roberts Court was willing to suggest her religious liberty arguments sounded good. Last week, the high court declined to get involved in her case and to let her disobey a federal judge's order. Defiance of that order was what ultimately landed Davis in jail for contempt of court.Though the Supreme Court's refusal to intervene last week was issued without an explanation, it at least indicated that the justices aren't eager to advance the culture war between gay rights and religious rights that Huckabee is pushing.Nodding to the separation of powers and ""the genius of our Constitution,"" Huckabee told Davis supporters on Tuesday that the Supreme Court's power is ""limited"" and that it ""can only review a law."" Reasonably true.But then came his warning that ""the founders never gave that one branch of government the power to make a law.""Huckabee added, ""That is reserved for the representatives of the people. Our founders were so concerned that they said that should we ever come to the place that we allow a court to run amok of its purpose, then we would be living under what is no less than judicial tyranny.""Huckabee was thin on the specifics of how to tell when a court is running ""amok."" But it can be gleaned from his comments Tuesday -- and a January interview with talk show host Hugh Hewitt -- that he thinks that Supreme Court rulings on constitutional issues aren't final and that state officials may flout them when they disagree.In the Hewitt interview, Huckabee said there has to be an ""agreement"" between the Supreme Court and ""the other two branches of government"" for something to become the law of the land. Anything less, he said, could potentially lead to a ""confrontation.""That thinking reveals a clear misunderstanding of basic civics, not to mention Arkansas' own appalling constitutional history.This is U.S. History 101: It was settled over two centuries ago that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter on the meaning of the Constitution and of the constitutionality of any laws that may conflict with it. The text of the Constitution provides that it is ""the supreme law of the land"" and that all other sources of law -- including the states and their constitutions -- are bound by it.Alternatively, Huckabee could look to a gubernatorial predecessor of his for clues on how misguided his comments are.Following the Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, Arkansas and its governor, Orval Faubus, stood in staunch opposition to desegregating the state's public schools. They claimed that Brown didn't bind them.That resistance led to the Supreme Court's ruling four years later in Cooper v. Aaron, which directly involved the Little Rock, Arkansas, school district. With one voice, the justices declared that Brown was indeed ""the supreme law of the land.""Why? Because the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution, they said, is ""of binding effect on the States.""In addition, the court pointed out that state officials take an oath to support the Constitution.

His listeners were a crowd rallying in support of Kim Davis, the recalcitrant Kentucky county clerk just released from jail. Hopefully, they didn't believe what Huckabee told them.""We do not want this country to become the smoldering remains of what was once a great republic, where the people rule,"" the former Arkansas governor told the crowd. That vision of America should not be ""exchanged for a place where five unelected lawyers think that they can rule,"" he said.""We're here to say, 'No, they cannot,'"" Huckabee declared. He was referring to the Supreme Court's June decision finding that gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to marry. Davis has famously -- or infamously -- opposed that ruling in her refusal to issue marriage licenses to all comers in Rowan County. Huckabee's mention of ""five unelected lawyers"" was borrowed from the landmark decision itself. In his dissenting opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the ""five lawyers"" -- otherwise known as his fellow justices -- who ruled in favor of gay couples ""have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law.""""Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept,"" Roberts wrote.It's not clear that a more majoritarian process, such as the Kentucky state legislature passing a law, would have persuaded Davis to go along with the new legal reality. But not even the Roberts Court was willing to suggest her religious liberty arguments sounded good. Last week, the high court declined to get involved in her case and to let her disobey a federal judge's order. Defiance of that order was what ultimately landed Davis in jail for contempt of court.Though the Supreme Court's refusal to intervene last week was issued without an explanation, it at least indicated that the justices aren't eager to advance the culture war between gay rights and religious rights that Huckabee is pushing.Nodding to the separation of powers and ""the genius of our Constitution,"" Huckabee told Davis supporters on Tuesday that the Supreme Court's power is ""limited"" and that it ""can only review a law."" Reasonably true.But then came his warning that ""the founders never gave that one branch of government the power to make a law.""Huckabee added, ""That is reserved for the representatives of the people. Our founders were so concerned that they said that should we ever come to the place that we allow a court to run amok of its purpose, then we would be living under what is no less than judicial tyranny.""Huckabee was thin on the specifics of how to tell when a court is running ""amok."" But it can be gleaned from his comments Tuesday -- and a January interview with talk show host Hugh Hewitt -- that he thinks that Supreme Court rulings on constitutional issues aren't final and that state officials may flout them when they disagree.In the Hewitt interview, Huckabee said there has to be an ""agreement"" between the Supreme Court and ""the other two branches of government"" for something to become the law of the land. Anything less, he said, could potentially lead to a ""confrontation.""That thinking reveals a clear misunderstanding of basic civics, not to mention Arkansas' own appalling constitutional history.This is U.S. History 101: It was settled over two centuries ago that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter on the meaning of the Constitution and of the constitutionality of any laws that may conflict with it. The text of the Constitution provides that it is ""the supreme law of the land"" and that all other sources of law -- including the states and their constitutions -- are bound by it.Alternatively, Huckabee could look to a gubernatorial predecessor of his for clues on how misguided his comments are.Following the Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, Arkansas and its governor, Orval Faubus, stood in staunch opposition to desegregating the state's public schools. They claimed that Brown didn't bind them.That resistance led to the Supreme Court's ruling four years later in Cooper v. Aaron, which directly involved the Little Rock, Arkansas, school district. With one voice, the justices declared that Brown was indeed ""the supreme law of the land.""Why? Because the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution, they said, is ""of binding effect on the States.""In addition, the court pointed out that state officials take an oath to support the Constitution. No official can later wage a battle against that Constitution ""without violating his undertaking to support it.""That's awfully reminiscent of what Kim Davis is doing with her opposition to issuing marriage licenses -- which, in the view of one scholar, may be a sinful act in and of itself. And it's a constitutional lesson that should make Huckabee think twice before he tells people that a Supreme Court ruling doesn't bind them.Daniel Marans contributed reporting."
23,POLITICS,Oil Industry Gets Help On Undermining Ozone Standards From A Well-Informed Source,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-oil-industry-gets-help-on-undermining-ozone-standards-from-a-well-informed-source_us_55ef50a9e4b03784e276fa3a,A former EPA official is working with BP on a plan to undermine new smog standards.,2015-09-09,<p>This October 2008 photo shows smog shrouding downtown Houston.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to lower limits on ozone pollution has been fraught with controversy. But opponents of lowering the standard have a well-informed ally: a former EPA official who was involved in developing the updated standard. The agency's draft proposal, released last November, called for lowering the range of permissible ozone pollution to between 65 and 70 parts per billion, from the current limit of 75 parts per billion. Ground-level ozone pollution -- better known as smog -- forms from automobile exhaust and emissions from power plants and industrial facilities.Environmental and public health groups are lobbying for the final standard to fall on the lower end of that range, while oil and gas interests don't want to see it lowered at all.And those oil interests are getting an assist from former EPA official Bob Sussman. Sussman, who served as senior policy counsel at the EPA from 2009 to July 2013, is listed as an attendee at a meeting between EPA officials and the oil giant BP on July 24. Janet McCabe, EPA acting assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, and six other agency staffers attended the meeting. According to a summary of the meeting, BP has asked the agency to adjust the standard to include more exemptions for background levels of ozone pollution. Background levels of ozone can come from things like wildfires, or pollution that originates in other countries.BP argued that consideration of such background levels is putting an undue burden on some regions of the country. In issuing its proposal last year, EPA argued that the background levels aren't a major problem in most parts of the U.S., and described the various mechanisms in place under the Clean Air Act that already that allow for exemptions.Reached for comment, Sussman confirmed that he works for a number of clients, including BP, but said that he does not comment on specific projects and declined to discuss it further. Sussman now has his own consulting firm and is listed as an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law.A BP spokesman also told The Huffington Post that Sussman is ""among the outside consultants BP works with to accomplish its business objectives."" The BP spokesman said that while they discussed background ozone levels in the meeting, they ""did not discuss the appropriate level of the ozone standard."" But BP is also working through the American Petroleum Institute on the ozone issue, the spokesman confirmed. And API has taken the position that new standards ""are not justified from a health perspective because the science is simply not showing a need to reduce ozone levels.""The EPA's scientific advisory board, however, has advocated for lowering the standard, noting that a lower standard would yield more health protections, particularly for vulnerable groups like children, the elderly and people with lung conditions.The fight over the ozone standard has dragged on for years. The Bush EPA proposed setting the standard at 75 parts per billion in March 2008, which was notably higher than the scientific advisory board recommended. A group of environmental and public health groups, along with 11 state attorneys general, filed suit to block standards they said were too weak.The Obama administration revisited the standards shortly after taking office, releasing a draft proposal in January 2010 that called for lowering the limit to between 60 and 70 parts per billion. But the final rules were repeatedly delayed, and in September 2011 Obama himself directed the EPA to withdraw the proposal as part of an effort to reduce regulatory burdens.Environmental and public health groups sued again, and last year a federal judge gave EPA an October 2015 deadline for finalizing the rules. The EPA issued draft rules in November 2014 that proposed lowering the limit to 65 to 70 parts per billion.Sussman should have a good sense of how the standards would work -- he was working at the EPA when the agency first proposed the tougher standard in 2010, and according to news reports from the time, was involved in the decision-making process. The American Petroleum Institute made a presentation to Sussman at the time that focused on the background ozone issue.An EPA spokeswoman declined to comment.But others are pointing to Sussman's new role working with BP to weaken the standards as evidence of the revolving door of Washington. Sussman also worked as a deputy administrator in the Clinton administration EPA. After leaving the Clinton administration, he was a registered lobbyist for the firm Latham & Watkins. In 2008 he was named to Obama's transition team and then joined the EPA as a senior policy counsel.""It's really troubling to see an issue [Sussman] was deeply involved in, and then have [him] come back and petition the agency on those same issues,"" said a representative of a nonprofit group advocating to lower the ozone standard, talking on background in order to speak more freely. He called the BP position ""particularly cynical because the oil industry creates a lot of upwind pollution,"" and said that changing how the standard deals with background ozone is just as dangerous to public health as a higher overall limit. ""If you create a situation where you weaken the standard by removing days where dirty air is threatening the health of the public, it gets you to a similar place -- less health protection for the public,"" he said. ""It's not the frontal assault, but a surgical attempt to undermine the standard.""Others were happy to criticize the situation on the record. ""It truly is mind-boggling that he would go consult for a big oil company that obviously fears any air quality limits on fracking operations,"" said Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch, calling oil companies the ""ring leaders"" in efforts to block a tougher standard.EPA administrator Gina McCarthy has said the agency will release the final proposal by the Oct. 1 deadline."

But while you were busy being infuriated at the insensitivity of the whole situation (#facepalm #smh #everyhashtagaboutlosingfaithinhumanity), Jenner revealed she's not bothered by it at all. The ""I Am Cait"" star spoke about the costume with Matt Lauer for a two-part interview on the ""Today"" show."" Jenner insisted that she doesn't find it hurtful, but admitted the quality of the ensemble (which she's seen in real life) isn't totally up to her standards. In a preview for the interview, Lauer asks Jenner, ""When you hear that there are companies out there that want to do Caitlyn Jenner costumes for Halloween from the Vanity Fair cover, are you in on the joke or do you think it's offensive?""""I'm in on the joke. I don't think it's offensive at all,"" Jenner replied. ""I know the community does and they've gotten a lot of criticism for doing it. I think it's great.""The 65-year-old added, ""They could have a better looking outfit for him [the model], you know?"" she said, laughing. ""I mean that was a serious bustier on the cover of Vanity Fair, you know?""Jenner may not find the costume offensive, but as she mentioned in the interview, many in the trans community most definitely do. And we're with them on that. In a statement to The Huffington Post, Vincent Vilano of the National Center for Transgender Equality summed up all our thoughts on the matter in just one sentence. ""There's no tasteful way to 'celebrate' Caitlyn Jenner or respect transgender people this way on the one night of the year when people use their most twisted imaginations to pretend to be villains and monsters,"" he said.To watch the interview clip, head over to Today.com. The second part of Lauer and Jenner's interview will air on Thursday. Also on HuffPost: For a constant stream of entertainment news and discussion, follow HuffPost Entertainment on Viber."
