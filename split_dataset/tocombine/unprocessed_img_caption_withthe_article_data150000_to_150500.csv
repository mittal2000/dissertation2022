According to numbers released by Deadline.com, Hart's stand-up comedy film has already earned $7.4 million in ticket sales during its first two days of release. Per Variety, ""Let Me Explain"" could have $29 million in its coffers by Sunday night.Should Hart's film -- which was filmed at a sold-out Madison Square Garden appearance last year -- reach that lofty tally during opening weekend, it would already become the fourth highest stand-up comedy film of all time, behind only ""Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip"" ($36 million), ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" ($38 million) and ""Eddie Murphy Raw"" ($50 million).That ""Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain"" is a big success, however, isn't too shocking. Hart's last stand-up comedy film, ""Kevin Hart: Laugh at My Pain,"" earned $7.7 million after release in September of 2011, this despite the fact that it never played in more than 300 theaters. According to Deadline.com, ""Let Me Explain"" is in 876 theaters.This has been a good year for Hart, who has a small appearance in ""This Is The End"" and also hosted the 4th of July festivities in Philadelphia on Thursday night (broadcast by VH1). The next few months could only make him a bigger star: Hart features in no less than five movies set for release in 2013 and 2014, including ""Ride Along"" (with Ice Cube), ""Grudge Match"" (with Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone), ""School Dance"" (from director Nick Cannon) and a remake of ""About Last Night"" (with Paula Patton).For more on ""Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain,"" head over to Deadline.com.[via Deadline.com]"

""3D's here, and it's got an enormous amount of momentum,"" Cameron said in a 2010 interview with Movieline. ""Hopefully, the best outcome is that the audience is smarter and they know to be discriminating, and the studios are smarter and they know not to abuse the market. I'd like to think that's the case, going forward.""Later that year, Cameron called out the movie ""Piranha 3D"" for lessening the format that he worked so hard to perfect in ""Avatar.""""I tend almost never to throw other films under the bus, but that is exactly an example of what we should not be doing in 3D,"" Cameron told Vanity Fair. ""Because it just cheapens the medium and reminds you of the bad 3D horror films from the 70s and 80s, like 'Friday the 13th 3D.' When movies got to the bottom of the barrel of their creativity and at the last gasp of their financial lifespan, they did a 3D version to get the last few drops of blood out of the turnip. And that’s not what’s happening now with 3D. It is a renaissance—right now the biggest and the best films are being made in 3D. Martin Scorsese is making a film in 3D ['Hugo']. Disney’s biggest film of the year -- 'Tron: Legacy' -- is coming out in 3-D. So it’s a whole new ballgame.""Three years later, Cameron's still disappointed in the way Hollywood has used the extra dimension.""One thing is shooting in 3D and another to convert to 3D,"" Cameron said during a chat with director Alfonso Cuaron (translation via LaVerdad.com). ""After 'Avatar' changed everything, good and bad movies, everything has to be in 3D. The problem I see now is that instead of it being a filmmaker issue, it's a matter of the studios [trying] to make money and pushing 3D to directors who are not comfortable or do not like 3D."" In the interview, Cameron reportedly cited ""Man of Steel"" and ""Iron Man 3"" as movies that were ""spectacular"" already and didn't necessarily need additional bells and whistles like 3D.Cameron, of course, isn't alone in that thought process. J.J. Abrams, who directed this summer's ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" famously didn't want that film to get released in 3D. It, however, was.""I did not fight for the 3D,"" Abrams said last year. ""It was something the studio wanted to do.""For more on Cameron and his comments, head to TheFilmStage.com.[via TheFilmStage]"

I assume some time at the beginning of next year we'd like to be in the studio, but that all depends on when the feeling hits and when we have a concept that's worthy.

4,IMPACT,Where are the Mosquito Nets in Haiti?,"John M. Zervos, Contributor

The central hospital in the capital has been overrun by patients ever since the devastating earthquake struck Haiti, and still has patients in beds outside in the courtyard and parking lot. (Photo by Chris Hondros/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1ae4c2200003401db6341.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During a recent visit to Haiti, I visited homes at internally displaced persons locations throughout Port-au-Prince and noticed a general void of mosquito nets. In fact, I did not see one. This was perplexing; with the rest of the world, I had read and watched the extensive news coverage of the 2010 earthquake, including the distribution of hundreds of thousands of mosquito nets to these same communities I was now visiting. Mosquito nets are important to vulnerable populations in the developing world. They can provide an essential preventive measure against mosquitoes carrying life-threatening diseases such as malaria. Of the most vulnerable people in Haiti, are the 350,000 that remain displaced by the earthquake and reside in makeshift homes and tents at internally displaced person sites. Conditions at these sites are deteriorating. Residents lack access to basic services such as clean water, education, shelter and healthcare. As sanitation and drainage systems continue to weaken, pools of standing water are expanding, forming larger and new breeding grounds for the disease-carrying mosquitoes. To Haitians and many long-term expats residing in Haiti, the void of mosquito nets is far less perplexing. As Sam Bloch, founder of Port-au-Prince based Haiti Communitere explains ""There are a lot of people doing work here in Haiti, but without coordination and analysis of impact, even the most well-intentioned projects can fail."" Malaria prevention efforts in Haiti are no exception. Mosquito nets are universally regarded as an important tool in malaria eradication. However, simply passing out mosquito nets without further deliberation has failed in Haiti. As one resident of an internally displaced persons site informs, ""The nets had either been of poor quality and no longer functional, or had been sold by the recipient to pay for other more urgent needs such as food and clean water."" He added, ""The initial influx of free nets also had the effect of competing with local suppliers of mosquito nets, affecting the local economy, and with the decrease in international donations of nets, it is impossible now to find a net for free or for sale."" There is a spectrum of international-sponsored work being done in Haiti. On one side are the sustainable, long-term, capacity building projects and on the other side are the disastrous, disaster relief projects. After the earthquake the global community sent everything to Haiti without thinking much about where it was going. Haitians received items ranging from equipment without instructions, to board games in different languages to winter jackets and snow skies. But mosquito net distribution and many other internationally-sponsored efforts fall somewhere in the middle of this spectrum. They are well-intentioned efforts with both negative and positive impacts. Stories similar to that of the bed net are unfolding throughout Haiti. Take for example short-term medical relief. Over 60 percent of Haitians lack access to quality healthcare and Haiti has the highest infant mortality rate in the Western Hemisphere. Medical professionals from around the world have responded by donating time and money and traveling to Haiti to provide important care from basic rehydration to advanced surgeries. The need for these services is great. However, resources are not endless, medical mission groups go home, and there is little follow-up with patients. Community clinics, and Haitian doctors and nurses find it challenging to compete with the free medical care provided by international groups, and many close up shop and move elsewhere. Now, when medical relief groups are not present, it is hard to find local care in many communities. In other parts of the country, internationally-sponsored road construction is connecting communities and increasing access to services such as healthcare. However, many of the roads are poorly engineered and are flooding surrounding areas, destroying crops and increasing standing pools of water. Elsewhere, schools and healthcare facilities have been built, but sit empty as they are unfunded or rely on short term international groups for intermittent staffing.On my last day in Port-au-Prince, Dr. William Cadet, a long-time Haitian pediatrician and hospital administrator, provided some insight, ""Nobody collaborates. Well-intentioned groups fail because resources are not shared, short-term efforts are favored over long-term ones, and there is a general disinterest in collaborating with Haitians and the Haitian government."" Over 9 billion dollars has been committed to Haiti since 2010, yet the average Haitian's quality of life has not improved. Sam Bloch's organization understands this. Haiti Communitere is based on a bold yet simple principle - by creating a physical space for relief work, groups will be forced to collaborate and deliberate. Haiti Communitere welcomes anyone doing work in Haiti to stop by for a short visit, pitch a tent for a few nights, or even develop a project on the property. By visiting, groups can form connections with local collaborators and better coordinate efforts with other groups doing similar work in Haiti. But until other international organizations start working with local collaborators in Haiti, and make efforts to appreciate economic and sociological dynamics ""on the ground"", the efficacy of relief work will continue to be questioned."

After all, food is universally necessary, commonly beloved.",2013-07-04,"MIAMI BEACH, FL - FEBRUARY 23: Anthony Bourdain attends the South Beach Wine and Food Festival 2013 Grand Tasting Village on February 23, 2013 in Miami Beach, Florida. (Photo by John Parra/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d4fca2000003100fdea66.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I've never met Anthony Bourdain. I saw his live performance, ""Guts and Glory,"" at Michigan State University once. I've watched his TV shows, from A Cook's Tour through No Reservations and Parts Unknown, some of them repeatedly, stored on my iPhone for long trans-pacific flights or insomnia. That's all the biography I have of the man who took on Paula Deen long before the rest of the world did.Bourdain may not have planned it. Yet, somewhere along the way, he became almost by accident the most interesting, important travel journalist working today. Starting perhaps unintentionally with A Cook's Tour and finding his stride three or four seasons into No Reservations, Bourdain found out how to tell compelling stories about a place and its people, through the organizing principles of food, memory, biography and history. (Prayer and love are implied. And his other shows, The Layover, essentially a frenetic catalog of things to do in 36 hours, and The Taste, a game show, are puzzling detours that I'm choosing to overlook.) My claim about Bourdain's work is not a knock on the many people who went to school to do this for a living and show us what the adrenaline rush of urgency actually looks like. It doesn't diminish the achievements of good reporters who flesh out important stories. It doesn't overlook the fixers and translators who risk their lives with zero recognition to help us understand things we wouldn't otherwise see or hear. As a former journalist and editor, I know their work opens a window into worlds and circumstances far removed from ours.A self-described ""cranky, miserable bastard,"" Bourdain, however, didn't set out to do journalism. He set out to see places and eat strange things, like the ""business end of lower intestines."" Instead, he also gave us extraordinary TV. What Bourdain's managed to do is recruit the local cuisine and the people who eat, prepare and celebrate it as guides and storytellers, helping sharpen our sense of place. After all, food is universally necessary, commonly beloved. Properly prepared, food can be a catalyst for our strongest memories. And as every Singaporean knows -- and Bourdain points out -- food can spark raging debate, especially in places where disharmony are discouraged.In Italy, Provence and Croatia, Bourdain shows food as the gospel of simplicity: Large meals, family gatherings, life lived in sunny outdoors. In Myanmar, recently emerged from oppression, condiments are the virtue that convert crude, common staples into what Bourdain would call ""something delicious,"" where need, ingenuity and simple ingredients can transform the table.Bourdain's shows and Bourdain himself are impolite. F-bombs drop at an average clip of 3.4 seconds. In Kuala Lumpur and Quito, he unabashedly wrestles with bull penises as they flop about in indigenous bowls of true nose-to-tail gastronomy. In a post-modern world, he is avidly self-referential, making pitch-perfect references to Joe Francis, Midnight Express, The Situation's farts, Kim Kardashian's ass. More importantly, Bourdain isn't timid in the face of difficult questions or uncomfortable truths. And here's where Bourdain and great journalism intersect, at that place James Joyce describes as the junction of pathos and satire. In Laos, he sits down for a meal with a farmer and his family. The farmer has one arm, one leg, his limbs obliterated by an American bomb dropped during the secret war in southeast Asia. The meal has meat and fish, both luxuries in one of the poorest corners of the globe. Bourdain notes that he and his guide are honored guests. The farmer, we are told, could not provide for his family after losing his arm and leg, a ""great disaster for his life."" Here's how the rest of the dialog goes:Bourdain: ""Is he angry?""The question catches Bourdain off guard. He offers an answer, squirming, about Americans needing to see the consequences of war. In Laos, he suspends his cocky attitude, the trademark of an on-screen persona that drives the energy of his narratives, and plaintively asks: ""What do you talk about with a guy who lost his arm, his leg, his self-image, his livelihood, his pride, to a bomb your country dropped over 30 years ago?""A relevant question in Laos, a relevant one today as we leave behind our legacies in Iraq and Afghanistan and Yemen and who knows where else, struggling years later, over a meal with a legless farmer. He does this again and again, sharing moments of clarity and candor in unexpected places. On the impoverished Isla Tierrabomba, Cartagena's lavish skyline gleaming in the distance, he coaxes a fisherman to proudly proclaim the triumph of happiness in a place of destitution -- an apt scene in a world growing increasingly polarized by the widening wealth gap.A three-minute segment on a Hong Kong noodle-maker isn't just one of the most beautiful scenes on TV ever made. It is also one of the most instructive, reminding us that slow food, though noble, is in a losing battle with time and technology.Bourdain has fun without being frivolous. His shows are smart, entertaining, well-thought-out mini-documentaries about people, places and, yes, food, which in the end serves to give us meaningful, poignant glimpses into the lives, the humor and the resilience of people we wouldn't otherwise meet: farmers in Laos, cab drivers in Istanbul, saloonkeepers in Harbin, sausage makers in Detroit. Food provides the essential fulcrum in the places Bourdain visits, at home and abroad, so a place's people and culture have enough leverage to hoist themselves just a little bit above the humdrum and, by so doing, become distinct. And that, the discovery of the new, the celebration of ordinary people who cherish simple things, however accidental, are what make great journalism."
