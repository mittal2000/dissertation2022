He did so by mentioning a present his “fiancée” gave him in December 2014: his dog, Kane:I had no idea what I was in for as a new dog owner. He was a Christmas gift last year from my fiancée, whose family had Mastiffs growing up. I’ve never owned a pet in my life.***It appears that all-time Yankee great Derek Jeter has traded one diamond for another. Thirteen months after retiring from the MLB, Jeter has put a ring on the finger of girlfriend Hannah Davis, according to the New York Daily News.While the 25-year-old model silenced earlier engagement rumors last April, sources told the Daily News that Davis “already has the ring” this time around.Jeter’s representation had no statement on the report, while Davis’ could not be reached for immediate comment.Rumors of the couple’s relationship first began to spread in 2012, when the two were seen at a concert, the Gramercy Park Hotel and elsewhere throughout the city. However, they didn’t make their official red carpet debut -- the celebrity version of a Facebook relationship status change -- until May of this year, when they posed together at the 2015 Met Gala. Jeter, 41, has previously voiced his interest in settling down, telling NBC in September 2014 that he “want[s]” and “look[s] forward to” having a family.Time will tell if the reports are true and if Jeter has officially traded his Yankee pinstripes and baseball cap for a tux and a wedding ring.Also on HuffPost:"

In the coveted 25-54 age group, CNN drew 293,000 viewers during primetime in October -- just 1,000 short of Fox News’ primetime viewership for the same demographic.Fox News remained the cable news leader in all other categories as well. The network drew an average of 1,085,000 total viewers in October, and 1,760,000 during primetime. Among all basic cable channels, Fox ranked third behind ESPN and the Major League Baseball playoffs on TBS.As it did in September, Fox News still boasts the top 14 cable news programs. “On the Record with Greta Van Susteren,” “The Kelly File” and “Hannity” have been No. 1 in their time slots for 25 months, while “The O'Reilly Factor” has remained in the top perch for 179 consecutive months. CNN viewership has nonetheless improved since last year, averaging 511,000 viewers this October -- a 22 percent jump since October 2014. The network's gains were far more impressive during primetime. With an average of 956,000 viewers from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., CNN more than doubled its primetime viewership compared to the same period last year. There were some individual wins for CNN as well. The total number of viewers for “Anderson Cooper 360” increased by 40 percent over last year, while “CNN Tonight With Don Lemon” was up a more modest 6 percent. As political season heats up, and with Brian Williams anchoring breaking news, MSNBC’s ratings woes seem to be easing. The network was up 26 percent in both total viewers and primetime viewers compared with last year, with an average of 388,000 viewers during the day and 631,000 during primetime. A raft of shows on MSNBC experienced double-digit growth. Up 31 percent from last year, “The Rachel Maddow Show” beat out CNN in both total viewers and viewers in the 25-54 demographic, while “Hardball With Chris Matthews” and “The Last Word With Lawrence O’Donnell” bested CNN in total viewers. Chris Matthews' show was up 16 percent, Chris Hayes’ was up 32 percent and Lawrence O'Donnell's was up 33 percent. In all, the networks held their longstanding positions in terms of total viewers for October, with Fox News first, CNN second and MSNBC third. "

Top Hispanic groups are warning Republican candidates to stop offending the Hispanic community if they want its support in the 2016 election.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5630097f1c00002d00570c10.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BOULDER, Colo. -- On the eve of the third Republican presidential debate, an unprecedented gathering of two dozen top Hispanic conservative groups issued a stern warning to all candidates: Refrain from engaging in incendiary rhetoric on the campaign trail or we’ll refuse to support you in your bid for the White House.The meeting, held less than a mile from the site of the debate at the University of Colorado's Boulder campus, was organized by the American Principles Project's Latino Partnership. It was also attended by leaders from other grassroots groups, including the Latino Coalition, Hispanic Leadership Fund and the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference -- all key groups engaged in building support for Republicans among the Latino community.Officials present said that no campaign or party had spurred the meeting, but rather conservative activists desired to come off the sidelines to condemn inflammatory rhetoric about the Hispanic community -- a key demographic in the swing state of Colorado.“We want candidates to know: We’re monitoring your language. We are monitoring what you propose. And we’re going to hold you accountable,” said Alfonso Aguilar, head of the American Principles Project's Latino Partnership.Rosario Marin, former treasurer of the United States under President George W. Bush, put it much more bluntly.""Heed our warning. Don’t expect us to come to your side during the general election. You are not with us now, we will not be with you then. You don’t need our vote now, you won’t have it then. You insult us now, we will be deaf to you then. You take us for granted now, we will not recognize you then,” she said.Although she did not refer to him by name, Marin, who supports former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, made clear her remarks were directed at businessman Donald Trump, whose rhetoric about Hispanics has worried GOP officials.“We have not worked on behalf of this party for decades only to see our community work undone by the divisiveness of some candidates,” she added. “I will not name names, but one in particular has earned my absolute disgust and contempt. I will not dirty my mouth by pronouncing his name. In fact, grouping him as a candidate is an insult to the serious candidates we have in this primary.”The group of Hispanic leaders, which included small business owners, working moms and veterans, also discussed the rhetoric and proposals of other candidates in the 2016 presidential race, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Jeb Bush. But the activists made clear their ultimatum was directed at only one candidate, who continues to poll well in the race for the GOP nomination.""At this point, I think we’ve been very clear that we are not going to endorse or attack any candidate besides Trump,” said Aguilar. ""If we don’t see a course correction, then I think we may start naming other names.""The groups plan to meet again in December ahead of the Republican debate in Las Vegas, where they'll gauge the state of the race once more.Democrats, however, panned the effort to isolate Trump as an objection grounded more in style rather than substance. Eric Walker, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, compared the real estate mogul's record on immigration to that of his rivals for the GOP nomination.“Whether it’s Donald Trump, Marco Rubio who abandoned the bipartisan immigration bill and voted to target immigrants just last week, or Jeb Bush who slurs the children born to undocumented immigrants, all of the Republican candidates would be a disaster for Latino families -- not to mention their economic policies, which would hurt Latino communities,"" said Walker."
3,POLITICS,Corinthian Colleges Loses Federal Lawsuit As Education Department Faces Reckoning,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/corinthian-colleges-loses-federal-lawsuit-as-education-department-may-face-bill_us_5630d9d6e4b0c66bae5a4411,A federal court's ruling could bolster debt-forgiveness claims by allegedly defrauded Corinthian students.,2015-10-28,"Education Secretary Arne Duncan said he was ""thrilled"" to shut down Corinthian Colleges Inc.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Defunct for-profit college chain Corinthian Colleges Inc. violated federal law by using false job placement rates to deceive 115,111 former students into taking out student loans, a federal district court judge ruled on Tuesday. In a lawsuit brought last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleged that Corinthian duped prospective students into enrolling and taking out loans by falsely advertising future job prospects. The company, which declared bankruptcy in May, operated for-profit schools under the Everest, Heald and Wyotech brands and had previously denied wrongdoing.The ruling by Judge Gary Feinerman in Chicago could force the Department of Education to forgive the former students' federal student debt, thanks to a provision in federal law that gives student debtors the right to apply for total debt forgiveness if schools mislead them into taking out federal student loans. Former Corinthian students have taken out nearly $4 billion in loans from the Education Department over the last five years. In the past, the Education Department has fought efforts by aggrieved former students who claim their schools cheated them. Many students have had to prove they were defrauded -- a particularly tough standard for people who don't have the resources to hire attorneys. Few have received the kind of relief top Education Department officials, like Under Secretary Ted Mitchell, have repeatedly promised them in the face of severe criticism over the government's alleged inaction. Mitchell said in June that the Education Department would attempt to ""fast-track relief"" for defrauded borrowers based on legal findings. Feinerman's ruling should compel the Education Department to do just that by discharging the former Corinthian students' debts, consumer advocates said. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in July that he was ""thrilled"" to shut down Corinthian.""It would be smart, just and entirely appropriate for Secretary Duncan to cite this ruling as a strong basis for providing comprehensive debt relief for former Corinthian students,"" said David Halperin, a Washington lawyer and former senior vice president at the Center for American Progress who is critical of the for-profit college industry.Richard Cordray, CFPB director, alluded to the uphill climb former Corinthian students may face in battling a reluctant Education Department, noting in a statement, ""We all have much more work to do before current and past students who were hurt by Corinthian’s illegal practices can be made whole.""Last month, Corinthian told Feinerman that the company would no longer defend itself against the CFPB's allegations. As a result, Feinerman ruled in favor of the CFPB in a default judgment, finding that the company owed its former students who took out its private student loans $531,224,267 in restitution. But Corinthian has little in the way of assets or funds that would make defrauded students whole. The company paid its former executives handsomely, many of whom now work for Zenith Education Group, an arm of debt collector and Education Department contractor ECMC Group that purchased more than 50 former Corinthian schools in a sale engineered by the Education Department. Mark Collins, a Delaware lawyer representing Corinthian in its ongoing bankruptcy case, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The significance of Feinerman's ruling lies in its description of how Corinthian misled its former students and how that deception led them to take out student loans. Corinthian marketed its own private Genesis loans to students because the Education Department requires for-profit schools to obtain at least 10 percent of their revenue from sources besides federal student loans and grants from the department.Feinerman said that Corinthian induced students to take out its Genesis loans from at least July 2011 to July 2014, ""through a series of misrepresentations about the likely employment outcomes for Corinthian students,"" such as falsified and overstated job placement rates.That deceptive move, he said, was both ""material"" and likely to mislead borrowers who were acting reasonably. Therefore, Feinerman concluded, Corinthian violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act, a section of the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. That is key, consumer advocates said, because students misled into taking out Genesis loans would have been misled into taking out federal student loans, too.Aggrieved former Corinthian students can now use Feinerman's ruling to get Duncan to discharge their federal debt. Under the Education Department's interpretation of a 1993 law that responded to earlier abuses by for-profit schools, borrowers have the right to claim a ""defense against repayment” if they believe that their school's deception violated their state's laws and led them to take out a loan.And since all states have statutes that prohibit the kind of conduct Feinerman said Corinthian engaged in, consumer advocates believe the judge's ruling should be sufficient for the Education Department to discharge much of the debt Corinthian students have incurred over the last five years.""The Education Department needs to take immediate action,"" said Chris Hicks, an organizer who leads the Debt-Free Future campaign for the Washington-based nonprofit Jobs With Justice. Former Corinthian students, he said, ""shouldn’t have to once again prove on a case-by-case basis that they were victims of these practices.""What's more, consumer advocates said, Feinerman has explicitly declared that Corinthian violated the law -- a big change from past cases in which government authorities have sued for-profit schools, only to settle the charges and allow schools to either deny or avoid the question of whether they engaged in wrongdoing.""The Education Department can take this court order and say it compels us to wipe away these debts,"" said Maura Dundon, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending. ""I don't know why the department wouldn't do that. The department has serious responsibilities to these students it permitted to enroll in Corinthian's schools and incur so much debt.""The Education Department ultimately could deny aggrieved Corinthian borrowers' claims for debt relief, Dundon and Halperin said. But both stressed that Feinerman's ruling should constitute enough evidence for the department to forgive former Corinthian students' federal student loans. ""The ruling gives Arne Duncan the opportunity to set a new course where the federal government takes responsibility for what it has allowed to happen,"" Dundon said. Duncan announced earlier this month he would leave office by December. Dorie Nolt, an Education Department spokeswoman, declined to comment."

For example, do you like fruit and flowers? Thank bats for being such great pollinators. Hate insects? Thank you bats, again, for eating them by the ton!""These are incredible animals,"" Tuttle tells The Huffington Post. ""I keep making new discoveries."" Tuttle's just-released memoir, The Secret Lives of Bats: My Adventures with the World's Most Misunderstood Mammals, gets into both the bats and the man who has spent his life learning everything he can about them.It's a terrific read that will give you a much deeper appreciation of the 1,300-odd types of bats we now know exist, and all the work -- and joy -- that goes into understanding and protecting them. ""Bats can form longterm friendships. They share information. They adopt orphans. They help others in need. They do all kinds of neat things that people wouldn't even dream of finding in a little animal like a bat,"" Tuttle said. ""Wherever you look, you can find some kind of bat that's doing something new and amazing.""The book conveys much of this amazement. It's also advancing arguments against scare-mongering, with regard to bats spreading diseases like rabies and Ebola.They're necessary, given that an estimated quarter of the world's bats are considered to be in serious trouble -- close to home, too, where North American bats are dying by the million from a fungus called White Nose Syndrome.Indeed, Tuttle hopes that his work -- his long decades of conservation advocacy, his new book and his thousands and thousands of gorgeous photographs -- is helping bring the public perception of bats, and in turn conservation efforts, ""a step in the right direction.""There's lots of work left to do, as bats still face habitat loss, disease, hunters, diminished food supplies and a host of other hostile factors. Tuttle also cites improvements. Like Thai farmers getting excited about how bats are essential to the growing of their beloved durian fruit. And Austin city officials enthusing about an estimated 100,000 visitors per year coming to witness the world's largest urban bat colony.The hope is that even more successes are coming down the line, as folks become more aware of how great bats are.""I’ve been privileged to discover bats as safe neighbors with winsome personalities and incredible intelligence, who contribute dramatically to human well-being,"" Tuttle said. ""And by sharing my adventures into their secret world, I hope one day to see these villains of the past become heroes of the future."" To address one last point: reading this terrific book, seeing the wonderful photographs, may lead you to become so bat-loving that you think perhaps it'd be fun to keep one of these smart, adorable creatures as a pet?Well, just cut that out right now.No matter how charmed you might be by Tuttle's photos and stories, do not try to keep a pet bat for yourself. Not because bats are dangerous, but because you are.""They have all kinds of unique needs. Imagine trying to keep an animal fed that can catch 1,000 mosquito-sized insects in an hour,"" said Tuttle ""Bats are very sophisticated animals that really require so much more attention than most of us would know how to provide.""Follow Merlin Tuttle's work on Facebook and on his website, where he's made dozens of his gorgeous photographs available for free download.

In fact, even Netflix doesn't offer that benefit to all of its workers. Still, there are creative ways to give perks to new moms. Domo, a 5-year-old startup based in Utah with a workforce of 600 employees, came up with something pretty innovative.Every pregnant woman at the company gets $2,000 in gift cards to buy maternity clothes, according to an article by Claire Zillman in Fortune. If you've ever had to go to work in an office while pregnant, you will instantly understand why this is awesome.For those of you who haven't, here's the deal: No one really wants to spend/waste money on maternity clothes -- you only need them for a very limited amount of time and they are expensive. Most of us just sort of muddle through, buying a few things, borrowing a lot of things and making do with stuff in our closet that is stretchy or big.That's fine when you're home on the weekends, but it's a big bummer at the office, where you want to maintain a professional appearance and often wind up donning some pretty weird garments. Like, oh I don't know, a maternity shirt your cousin wore in the 1990s with a bow at the collar that seems like an OK idea in the morning but makes you feel like a sad, old Christmas present. (That may be something I know about firsthand.)Domo's chief executive came up with the idea for the perk after his assistant became pregnant, Zillman told Fortune. The company, which helps other businesses manage their data, doesn't offer Cadillac-level maternity leave. You get one month at full pay and then six weeks at partial pay. Five or six people have used the clothing benefit so far, Fortune reports.Would more paid leave probably be preferable to a new wardrobe? Yes, sure. Still, the gift cards are a nice idea and certainly signal to employees that they're valued at a time that can feel very uncertain to a lot of women. And small signals like that add up, making employees more loyal to companies, which are then less likely to have to train new workers because their current ones stick around. It's a win-win -- and nobody has to dress like a Christmas present. "

Tesla's safety standards were called into question after two of its Model S sedans caught fire in 2013. The two incidents -- one in Seattle, Washington, and the other in Smyrna, Tennessee -- made national headlines, leading to a highly publicized federal investigation. In a Medium post in 2014, Elon Musk addressed the controversy, noting that no ""serious, permanent injuries of any kind"" had ever occurred in a Tesla. He also introduced new changes to the car's titanium shielding, which would reduce the risk of car fires and ""give Model S owners complete peace of mind.""After these changes, the Model S achieved a 5-star safety rating from both the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the European New Car Assessment Programme, setting a new record for the lowest likelihood of passenger injury.

10,POLITICS,Is Hillary Clinton Really Surging In Iowa?,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iowa-poll-hillary-clinton_us_562f94f0e4b0c66bae597aa4,"Two new polls show her rapidly outpacing Bernie Sanders, but most others give her a far more modest edge.",2015-10-27,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton holds an overwhelming lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) in two new surveys of the Iowa caucus, results that either stand out as significant outliers or mark a dramatic surge.Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by 41 points in Monmouth University's first survey of Iowa's Democrats. She leads by 38 points in a Loras College poll also released Tuesday, up from the 25-point lead she held in Loras' August survey.That's a sharp departure from the three other polls conducted in Iowa this month, which show Clinton ahead of Sanders by just 3, 7 and 11 percentage points. HuffPost Pollster's average, incorporating all publicly available polls, gives Clinton about a 7-point lead over Sanders.It's unsurprising that Clinton's numbers are on the rise. She benefited this month both from a strong debate performance and from Vice President Joe Biden's decision not to enter the presidential race, and rallied Democrats with her testimony in last week's 11-hour Benghazi hearings.If Clinton had pulled away from Sanders to the extent shown in the latest two Iowa polls, however, she might be expected to have surged similarly in national surveys, where she's traditionally performed better. Nationally, though, she leads by a relatively modest average of 26 points, up from 19 points at the beginning of October.Another part of the explanation may lie in the way the pollsters attempted to screen for voters who are likely to turn out for the caucus.Unlike some other survey houses, which have relied on voters' own assessments of whether they'll participate, Monmouth surveyed only registered Democrats who both voted in at least one of Iowa's last two state primaries (which in 2014 featured uncontested Senate and gubernatorial races) and said they were likely to attend the caucuses next February.As The New York Times' Nate Cohn noted, those requirements could knock out many first-time caucusgoers, voters who aren't affiliated with a party, or those who vote in presidential caucuses but not most primary elections. Those groups helped President Barack Obama pull a win in 2008 and are more likely to lean toward Sanders in 2016.Patrick Murray, Monmouth's polling director, noted in an email that Democratic caucus turnout in Iowa has varied substantially over the past four decades, and said that he based the poll's turnout model on the 2000 contest between Al Gore and Bill Bradley.Loras College, however, looked at voters who participated in either the 2012 or 2014 general elections. It also included voters who weren't currently registered Democrats but had a history of voting in primaries and said they were likely to participate in next year's caucus, as well as voters who registered after December 2014.Monmouth surveyed 400 likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa between Oct. 22 and Oct. 25, while Loras surveyed 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa between Oct. 19 and Oct. 22. Both used live interviewers to reach landlines and cell phones.This story has been updated with comments from Patrick Murray. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Loras College looked at voters who participated in the 2012 or 2014 state primaries. Loras looked at those who participated in the general elections. Also on HuffPost:"

Instead, the results largely reflect a stalemate, with the Democrats who already supported her bolstered in their faith, and the Republicans who already opposed her further entrenched in their convictions.Democrats, who've never been particularly concerned over either Clinton's use of a private email server or her actions in Benghazi, mostly didn't watch the proceedings -- just 40 percent reported seeing even clips of her testimony. A majority of those who did see at least clips say her testimony gave them additional confidence in her. In contrast, Republicans, who have long cited both the emails and the Benghazi attacks as serious concerns, were more likely to tune in, with two-thirds saying they'd seen some video of the debate. Most say it lessened their views of Clinton.Just 3 percent of Democrats who watched the hearing said it worsened their opinion of Clinton, while 2 percent of Republicans said it improved their opinion of her.Watching the hearing actually seemed to reinforce preexisting partisan opinions. Democrats who watched at least some of the hearing were more than twice as likely to approve of Clinton's handling of the attacks in Benghazi than those who didn't, who remained mostly undecided. Republicans who watched were more likely than those who didn't to express strong disapproval.Those political independents who watched were more likely to lean toward the Republican Party than the Democratic Party -- and they also reacted more similarly to the Republicans than the Democrats, with most saying the questioning had soured their opinions on Clinton. The hearing has widely been heralded as a win for Clinton, who avoided taking obvious hits and emerged with strengthened support in Democratic primary polling. The American public, though, isn't entirely ready to lay the issue to rest. Forty-one percent of those polled by HuffPost/YouGov think the investigation into the Benghazi attacks should continue, while just 30 percent believe it should be concluded, and another 29 percent aren't sure. The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 23-25 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

12,POLITICS,Paul Ryan Mad About Budget Bill His Staff Helped Write,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-disability-social-security-budget_us_562fa01ce4b06317990f7e1b,"""Paul Ryan's staff was involved in crafting the provision for weeks.""",2015-10-27,Ryan knows a thing or two about crafting secret deals.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_8_123_3982_1483%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Tuesday morning that he hadn't seen the new bipartisan budget deal and that the secretive process used to craft it ""stinks,"" but there's stuff in the bill that should smell good and familiar to him. One of its most important provisions makes changes to the Social Security Disability Insurance program, and some of those changes came from the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees Social Security and which Ryan chairs. ""Paul Ryan's staff was involved in crafting the provision for weeks,"" a Democratic aide told HuffPost. ""His staff signed off on the provision, his staff also signed off on other key provisions"" related to tax compliance and Medicare. Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck denied that Ryan's committee staff crafted the disability provision within the context of the legislation, which was negotiated by the White House with party leaders in the House and Senate. The committee had been working on changes to disability benefits earlier this year; Buck acknowledged that Ways and Means staff were aware the disability provision would be included.""They grabbed off the shelf what we’d been working on for months,"" Buck said, adding that Ryan supports the provision. ""We were aware of that, but not what all was being traded back and forth."" At 52 pages, the disability insurance provision comprises a significant portion of the 144 page bill. It would prevent a 20 percent benefit cut scheduled to kick in next year for SSDI's 11 million beneficiaries by diverting revenue from Social Security's better-known retirement insurance program -- a strategy some Republicans previously said amounted to ""raiding"" that program's coffers.The bill is also supposed to save $4 or $5 billion by tightening eligibility requirements for disability benefits, partly by requiring the Social Security Administration to make sure all initial applications include a medical screening.""Those provisions will likely require workers with disabilities to wait longer to receive their earned benefits and may prevent some from receiving their earned benefits completely,"" Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, said in a statement that was mostly supportive of the deal. The deal would also test ways of encouraging disability recipients to rejoin the workforce, which they rarely do. Benefits for people who decide to participate in a pilot project ""shall be reduced by $1 for each $2 by which"" their earnings exceed their work expenses as related to their disability. Gradual benefit offsets for working disability recipients were a key focus of a hearing Ryan chaired in July. As Ryan explained, the Social Security Administration can terminate disability benefits if a recipient earns too much money. ""Here’s the crux of it: If you make just one dollar more than you’re allowed, you get kicked off the program,"" Ryan said at the time. ""In other words, it’s a lot safer to stay on the sidelines. No surprise then that only one-half of one percent earn enough to get off the program.""Ryan also promised at the time that the benefit cut wouldn't happen. ""No 20 percent cut. Full stop. Not gonna happen,"" he said. On Tuesday morning, Ryan criticized the closed-door nature of the budget bill negotiations. ""About the process I can say this: I think the process stinks,"" he told CNN, adding that he was reserving judgment on the bill itself. The House is set to vote on Ryan's bid to be its next speaker this week."

Let's skip to the bottom line: It wasn't by silencing critics in the Black Lives Matter movement or anywhere else.The report, released by the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), found that law enforcement agencies with higher educational requirements, an emphasis on conflict management, and video cameras in their cars were less likely to face ambush attacks. It also noted that most suspects in ambush attacks were white.""The effect of requiring new officers to have at least some college education was a 54 percent decrease in ambush assaults,"" the report noted. Agencies that ""evaluated new hires on conflict management"" had an average of 43 percent fewer ambushes, while agencies with ""a camera in every patrol car"" faced 61 percent fewer ambushes, according to the report. The study recommended ""progressive hiring practices"" for law enforcement agencies, which it suggested could ""make for a safer department and community."" It noted previous studies indicating that agencies with better educated officers are also ""associated with fewer uses of force, more restraint in force encounters, and fewer citizen complaints.""""Our findings indicate that police departments that place a greater emphasis on education and conflict resolution may have officers who are more apt to resolve conflicts without using force and therefore officers in that agency, as a whole, may be less likely to be victims of retaliatory attacks or targeted acts of extreme violence such as ambushes,"" the report stated.In August, some of the leading voices in the Black Lives Movement released a list of specific proposals for reforming police departments. They included requiring the use of body cameras on police and instituting rigorous training on such matters as conflict resolution, de-escalation and minimizing the use of force. The DOJ report also found a connection between violence in communities and ambush attacks on police. It pointed to a ""growing body of evidence"" that violence by police officers against citizens ""is correlated with violent crimes committed by non-police suspects.""Ambush attacks on police are rare. The study noted that their rate has been essentially unchanged for the last two decades, pointing to data covering the years 1990 to 2013.""While concern has grown, all available evidence shows that officer felonious deaths and assaults generally have been declining since the crime wave began subsiding in the latter part of the 1990s,"" the report said. ""As time passes, researchers, policymakers, and journalists alike will no doubt continue to monitor these trends for any remarkable changes.""The report was made public on Tuesday shortly before President Barack Obama addressed the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Chicago. Attorney General Loretta Lynch had been scheduled to speak, but stayed in Washington because she was ill, according to DOJ.""We know that the murder of a police officer in the line of duty is an assault on the entire community. However, when that murder is a result of an ambush, it also attacks the very foundation of our democracy,"" COPS Director Ronald Davis said in the report. ""In the words of President Obama, this is totally unacceptable. And we must act to address this persistent threat.""Lynch said in a statement that the report ""would serve as a critical base of knowledge as we work to defend our law enforcement and ensure our officers' safety."""
14,RELIGION,Why Forgiveness Is At The Center Of Faith For This Black Pastor,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/forgiveness-faith-black-pastor_us_5626aa13e4b0bce34702c044,"""Life is too short to harbor ill feelings toward anyone,"" said the Rev. David Triggs.",2015-10-27,"Pastor Triggs points out the damage inside his church, which he says will cost more than $20,000 to fix.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562eb96c1900002e00b94f1b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The call came early in the morning, jolting the Rev. David Triggs out of his dreams and into a living nightmare. His church was burning, a friend told him over the phone. Minutes later, Triggs arrived at the St. Louis property where he and his congregation, United Believers in Christ Ministries, had worshipped for six years. It was heartbreaking to see what an arsonist had done to the place where he'd felt God's presence, Triggs told HuffPost in a phone interview. As he watched firefighters scrambling to save his church, Triggs said God spoke to him and challenged him to forgive. He saw a vision of Jesus on the cross, and remembered how Christ offered forgiveness to those who had persecuted him.""Before I could utter a word to the firemen, to anyone, I had already found forgiveness for the person who did this,"" the 43-year-old pastor said. ""We preach that the core foundation of Jesus' ministry is forgiveness. ...We can't preach that on Sundays and not live it out.""Black churches have long been the targets of violent attacks, bombings and arsons. In fact, Triggs' church was one of six predominantly black church buildings that have been hit by arson within the past few weeks in the St. Louis region. Despite this history, Triggs' forgiveness fits a pattern shown by black pastors and congregations in the face of violent and racially-motivated attacks.Forgiveness was on the mind of the Rev. Rodrick K. Burton, pastor of the New Northside Missionary Baptist Church in Missouri, whose church was hit by arson on Oct. 10. Burton told The Wall Street Journal his church has been focusing on ""forgiving and praying for whoever did this.""Forgiveness was also the response of many family members and friends of the nine worshippers killed during a Bible study at Charleston, South Carolina's, Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June. Chris Singleton, whose mother, Sharonda Coleman-Singletown, was killed in the attack, offered forgiveness to accused killer Dylann Roof just one day after her death. Other victims' families joined later, telling Roof during a video conference that they forgave him.The Rev. Jacqueline J. Lewis, senior minister at New York's Middle Collegiate Church, said she believes that for people who have been deeply wounded, forgiveness can be a ""holy act of power"" -- evidence of ""strength, not weakness.""She called forgiveness a sign of ""prophetic grief.""""Prophetic grief mourns, sighs deeply, and acknowledges its wounds. It speaks the truth about what is moral and just. And it forgives trespasses,"" Lewis told The Huffington Post. ""Forgiveness makes our load lighter, clears our path to work fervently for justice. In my mind, forgiveness and activism go hand in hand.""That was the type of forgiveness that Myrlie Evers-Williams, former NAACP national chairwoman, worked toward after her husband, the civil rights leader Medgar Evers, was murdered in 1963. Evers-Williams told The Associated Press that the desire for vengeance motivated her civil rights activism. Forgiveness was much harder to achieve.""The hatred has ended up as a motivational tool, and the forgiveness has been a salvation for me,"" said Evers-Williams. Triggs said he thinks justice and forgiveness are intricately linked. He said he hopes the arsonist who attacked his church will be brought to justice. But his experiences have taught him that the time for forgiveness is always ""now.""As proof, Triggs pointed to the recent sudden death one of his best friends. Triggs hadn't been on the best of terms with this friend and regrets that he never got the chance to make amends. ""It just really taught me that life is too short to harbor ill feelings toward anyone,"" Triggs said. Triggs said he wonders whether the arsonist is someone who felt hurt by Christians in the past. His prayer is that the anger in the person's heart is chiseled away.And his message to the arsonist is this: ""We forgive you and we love you so much.""  Also On HuffPost:"

Earnest said there was no evidence to back up Comey's statements.“In fact, you hear law enforcement leaders across the country indicating that that’s not what’s taking place,"" Earnest said.Comey has for several days blamed an increase in shootings and killings, in part, on the frequency of civilians reaching for their smartphones to document anything from a traffic stop to a protest. On Friday, he told several hundred students at the University of Chicago Law School the ""era of viral videos"" has led officers to feel they're ""under siege"" and unwilling to get out of their cars.Comey also said the prevalence of drugs and guns may be to blame. On Monday, he reiterated to a group of law enforcement officials at the International Association of Chiefs of Police that he had a ""strong sense"" officers were changing their behavior for fear of being caught on camera.“Each time somebody interprets [the] hashtag 'Black Lives Matter' as anti-law enforcement, one line moves away, and each time that someone interprets [the] hashtag 'Police Lives Matter' as anti-black, the other line moves away,"" Comey said, using an analogy of two lines, one representing law enforcement and the other local communities.The Huffington Post's Ryan J. Reilly noted the remarks lend credence to the so-called Ferguson effect, even though Comey has conceded there's little evidence to support the theory.The term, named after last year's unrest in Missouri, was coined by the Times and links the rise in violent crime to harsh scrutiny over officers' use of force. In fact, the rise in murder rates, which launched the notion that ""#BlackLivesMatter Costs Black Lives,"" has drawn harsh criticism.The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates has adamantly stated ""there is no Ferguson effect"" and called the link between crime and less-aggressive policing ""utterly baseless.""The Times notes the White House response can be seen as a reiteration of President Barack Obama's fierce attempts to end a decades-long policy of mass incarceration that primarily targets racial minorities. Under new policies from his administration, federal prison populations declined in 2013 for the first time since 1980.Obama is scheduled to speak at the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Chicago on Tuesday.Also on HuffPost:"

Only 28 percent of respondents said that they had conclusively settled on one candidate. The poll showed that more than half of Republican primary voters are paying ""a lot"" of attention to the race.Carson may be pulling ahead of Trump in the latest CBS/NYT poll, but a good portion of both candidates' supporters remain unsure of their decision. Eighty percent of respondents who backed Carson in the poll stated that it was too early in the race to know for sure if they would eventually vote for him. Trump supporters were a bit more firm in their decision, with 55 percent saying they have made up their minds on the reality TV star. The results underscore the unpredictable nature and volatility of early primary polls, and their ineffectiveness at predicting the eventual outcome of the race. At this time in the 2012 presidential race, Tea Party activist Herman Cain was leading the GOP field with around 26 percent of the vote. Early polls in previous presidential elections have also found that early frontrunners tend to fade over time, and often don't end up as the nominee.

But new research this week suggests that a game that prompts players to name real or fictional characters who fit certain combinations of attributes can actually reduce prejudice in those who play it. For years, researchers have explored the question of whether video games make people more violent, aggressive and prejudiced. But this new study, published in Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace, adds to a growing body of work that shows that some games can actually change views and behaviors of players for the better.  For the study, researchers from Dartmouth University asked hundreds of middle school and high school students to play two games. One is Buffalo: The Name-Dropping Game, in which players are prompted to name female physicists (along with English wizards, ""mischievous professors"" and hundreds of other random combinations). The other is Awkward Moment, in which players contemplate what to do when, say, they spot a store in the mall selling T-shirts for girls that say “Math is hard!” (Options include sending out “a distress signal,” saying “P.U. That stinks!” and “Be like Marie Curie and win Nobel Prizes."") After the kids played Awkward Moment, researchers presented players with a set of photographs of men and women and told them they needed help trying to decide what role each character should play in a new, unreleased game. Those who played Awkward Moment were a third more likely to suggest that female characters should be scientists than those who played a version of the game without any “awkward moments” related to gender bias. Those who played Buffalo, meanwhile, were more concerned about their own potential biases and showed less prejudice toward others than did the control group that didn’t play the game but answered the follow-up questionnaires. The trick to all of this is both simple and revealing of human nature. In order for people to change their prejudices after playing a game, they have to remain in the dark about the fact that the game is intended to change them. Both Buffalo and Awkward Moment are designed with this in mind.“There has to at least be the illusion of agency or the sense that your shift in mindset or perspective is at least partly volitional,” Geoff Kaufman, now an assistant professor at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and a co-author of the paper, explained to The Huffington Post. “That builds on decades of research in psychology, how any time you feel like there is an agent that is trying to persuade you, the more you resist it and the less effective it tends to be.”So could a quick game of Awkward Moment change the attitudes of someone like William Bader, the imperial wizard of the Trinity White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, who told a reporter at a rally this summer that “White revolution is the only solution”?Kaufman and his co-author, Mary Flanagan, didn’t examine how participants’ pre-existing levels of prejudice might have influenced their reactions to the games. But Kaufman was intrigued by the possibilities. Flanagan designed the games for the study. She's a professor in digital humanities at Dartmouth and the founder of Tiltfactor, a company that designs games for ""social change.""She and Kaufman are considering a digital version of the game that could assess baseline attitudes and then adapt, depending on how players respond.  “I’d be interested in the relationship between pre-existing levels of bias and how subtle the persuasive content needs to be,” he said. “Maybe you’d need to be even more extreme, using tactics of either concealing or hiding the persuasive content in the game.”Lila Shapiro covers the science fiction of science, the imaginative ways scientists are trying to solve the world’s hardest problems.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took a swipe at Wall Street Tuesday, detailing a  host of vacations, cruises and other perks that retirement professionals commonly receive for steering clients into particular investments. The rewards provide investment experts with plush incentives to shortchange retirees for their own personal benefit.Warren's description of the perks, outlined in a report issued by her office, serves as a fresh defense of a retirement security rule proposed by the Obama administration, which would prohibit such activity. Americans collectively lose about $17 billion dollars a year to conflicted retirement account advice, according to the administration.To solve that problem, the Department of Labor would impose a ""fiduciary duty"" on fund managers, requiring them to make investment decisions in the best interests of their clients and making it illegal for investment professionals to push clients into under-performing investments in order to score vacations or other benefits. Wall Street has aggressively lobbied against the rule, which is opposed by Republicans and many conservative Democrats with close ties to the financial industry.""The most frequently cited inducements involve paid trips to resorts and vacation destinations – often touted as annual sales meetings or conventions 'with an educational component,'"" the Warren report reads. ""One company noted the ubiquity and importance of these trips, describing them as a 'long standing practice' and 'an important tool … to incent sales.'""Warren's report details a host of rewards that annuities agents receive for high sales volumes. While the perks -- which the report describes as ""kickbacks"" -- do not compensate investment experts for specific sales of individual products, they do provide them with incentives to sell particular products to their overall client base, without regard to whether such products are appropriate for their financial profile.American Equity offered a trip to San Francisco in October 2015 for ""top performing"" sales agents (""and their guests"") with sales of over $3 million in annuities and life insurance. The company brochure for this trip notes that the ""event [is] in one of the country’s most picturesque and storied cities … at one of the world’s most luxurious hotels.""Warren said that such lavish travel arrangements are only described in ""the broadest and most vague terms"" in official investment disclosures -- terms that conceal their vacation-oriented nature.While most rank-and-file Democrats have been quiet (or at times, even hostile) to the Obama administration's retirement security rule, Warren has emerged as its staunchest proponent in Washington -- a marked shift from the summer, when Warren and Obama publicly feuded over trade policy.Zach Carter is The Huffington Post's senior political economy reporter and a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast, ""So That Happened.""
