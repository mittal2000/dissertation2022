4,POLITICS,Governors Of Different Parties Realize Redistricting Is Screwed Up,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maryland-gop-and-virginia-democrats-face-same-redistricting-problem_us_55cb8d67e4b0923c12beff9e,Maryland and Virginia's legislatures are just standing in their way of a fix.,2015-08-13,"<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; background-color: #eeeeee;"">Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan outlined plans for reforms to the state's legislative redistricting process during his State of the State address Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2015 in Annapolis, Md. </span></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_0_305_3296_2014%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Two governors have the same problem: Their states are heavily gerrymandered, giving one party a disproportionate share of seats in the state legislature and Congress. Both governors want to create independent redistricting commissions that would draw fairer districts. But both states' legislatures are virulently opposed to the idea. Here's the catch: The governors are from different parties. In Virginia, Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe is trying to convince a Republican legislature to give up its control over redistricting. Across the Potomac in Maryland, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan is trying to sell his state's Democratic legislature on the same idea. In most states, redistricting is an inherently political process: Whichever party is in power after each census draws district boundaries for the next 10 years. Although Democrats hold every statewide office in Virginia, they possess just three of the state's 11 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Maryland is a great example of how Democrats are as much at fault as Republicans, though they are more likely than the GOP to complain about gerrymandering: Democrats have a 2-to-1 advantage in voter registration, but a 7-to-1 advantage in the congressional delegation.In Virginia, a court found that Republican legislators illegally packed black voters into Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott's district. The court has ordered the legislators back for a special session starting Aug. 17 to redraw the lines. And in Maryland, Democratic legislators have been accused by both parties and by redistricting advocacy groups of spreading African-American voters across multiple districts and cramming Republicans into one -- that of GOP Rep. Andy Harris -- to ensure safe elections for their candidates. This results in some weird-looking districts. Here are two:Which party supports independent redistricting in a given state depends mostly on which party is dominant in that state. In 2000, Arizona voters expressed their frustration with gerrymandering by approving a ballot initiative that created an independent redistricting commission to draw the state's districts. Republican legislators sued after the 2012 election, arguing that it was unconstitutional to cut them completely out of the district-drawing process. (Defenders of the commission said Republicans were upset that it made districts more competitive.) In June, the Supreme Court ruled against the Arizona Republicans and allowed the commission to endure. Arizona Republicans were livid. But their GOP neighbors in California, where Democrats are overwhelmingly dominant, were relieved -- the decision protected California's redistricting commission from legal challenges and reduced the risk that Democrats will gerrymander the nation's most populous state.But Maryland and Virginia voters can't place referendums on the ballot as easily as Arizonans or Californians. In both eastern states, the legislature would have to approve the change. And Virginia Republicans and Maryland Democrats are loathe to risk their dominant positions.Advocates for independent redistricting in Virginia believe that the Arizona commission's victory should help their case. Their task is to convince Republicans in the Virginia House of Delegates to follow the state Senate's lead and put the question of an independent commission on the ballot as a constitutional amendment for the state's voters. But the lower chamber's leaders stonewalled the proposal, letting it die in committee earlier this year.""The Arizona case was tremendous from a political rhetoric standpoint; it meant a whole lot to us and it's proving the point that citizens can do this and take it out of the hands of politicians who have a tremendous conflict of interest,"" said Brian Cannon, the executive director of OneVirginia2021.In Maryland, polling has shown that a majority of the state's voters favor having an independent commission. But Democrats there have argued that reform redistricting should happen at the national level so as not to ""disadvantage"" Democrats or throw the relative representation of the states in Congress ""off balance."" ""Congress is deadlocked. We haven’t seen them act on anything of importance. To say we have to wait for them is just passing the buck,"" said Jennifer Bevan-Dangel, Common Cause Maryland's executive director. Groups that are opposed to gerrymandering in Maryland say that the districts are so spread out that it's tough for representatives to provide constituent services. The only way to convince Democratic legislators to back an independent redistricting proposal is to get their constituents to put the pressure on, argued Nancy Soreng, the co-president of the League of Women Voters of Maryland.""The best strategy is to get the people, the voters who are impacted by poor redistricting maps, to really let their legislators know that they want fair representation and they want the lines drawn in an open and transparent way,"" she said. Democratic legislators in Maryland appear to be digging in despite their governor's entreaties. State Rep. Will Smith told The Huffington Post that though he supports the concept of an independent commission in theory, he's more in favor of a national approach -- the prevailing argument made by his party's leadership -- or even a compact made between the two states bordering the District of Columbia. ""Let’s say Maryland goes ahead but Virginia doesn’t -- that could offset the balance,"" he said. But he also acknowledged the obvious meandering of his state's district boundaries.""Everyone wants fair and proportional representation and everyone wants districts that look like the communities that represent,""Smith said. ""Anyone looking at the districts can see that it's stretch as to how they are drawn.""***To illustrate how many politicians' views on independent redistricting depend on whether they're a member of the party in the majority in their state, here's a little quiz. Guess the party affiliation of these speakers -- the answers are at the bottom:1) ""My concern with the proposals we’ve seen is that [independent commissions] cede that responsibility to an unelected group. ... It’s a laudable goal, but not realistic."" 2) “This has been the process since we started our government ... and it’s not that I think that it’s a great process, but when you have an independent group, they become political, too. Who are they representing? Who appoints them?” 3) “They’re trying to take politics out of an inherently political process, and I don’t think forming some, quote, independent commission will do that, because then the politics is in who gets appointed to the independent commission.” 4) “Redistricting should be nonpartisan. ... I support reforms that will take the politics out of the process.” 5) ""Fair elections and a healthy and strong, competitive two-party system have been nearly impossible in our state. ... Gerrymandering is a form of political subterfuge that stifles real political debate and deprives citizens of meaningful choices.”Quiz Answers: 1) Virginia Del. Steve Landes (R) 2) Maryland Rep. C.A.

Currently, 150 investigations are underway at 130 colleges, according to the U.S. Department of Education. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55cbb4e114000077002e2bf6.jpeg?cache=QPopUJlRZi&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The University of Kansas is under more federal scrutiny than previously realized, with two simultaneous investigations underway into how one woman's sexual assault cases were handled. In addition, the school has been under monitoring by the U.S. Department of Education for a separate case from three years ago -- a fact not previously disclosed to the campus community.New documents obtained by The Huffington Post show that KU, in Lawrence, Kansas, is currently the subject of a pair of simultaneous investigations by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights -- thus accounting for two of the 150 investigations OCR is carrying out at colleges nationwide. KU is also being monitored as a result of a sexual violence case that was resolved in 2012, to ensure that the school is implementing the terms of a resolution agreement. The 2012 case is unrelated to the current investigations.The university has already taken steps to address student concerns regarding sexual violence. Earlier this year, a task force laid out a set of recommendations aimed at improving the school's handling of cases. And the federal investigations, in and of themselves, are not proof that the school has violated any laws.Still, the issues that led to OCR's second investigation of the University of Kansas tap into privacy concerns that have arisen at other schools. And they show how tricky it can be for a university to navigate the various federal laws at play when handling a student's sexual violence complaint.KU's entanglement with the federal government has unfolded along a complicated timeline involving multiple investigations by multiple parties. The roots of OCR's two current cases at KU go back to autumn 2013, when the school opened an investigation of its own after a female undergraduate accused a male undergrad of sexual assault. After the woman accused the male student, he admitted to campus police that on the night in question, he'd continued to have sex with the woman even after she told him to stop. The female student, whom HuffPost has spoken with, asked that she and her family remain anonymous in this story for privacy reasons.KU found the male student guilty of ""nonconsensual sex"" and sanctioned him with probation and a ban from student housing. The school also considered ordering the male student to perform community service, but ultimately chose not to, because it would have been ""strictly punitive,"" documents show.The university attempted to justify its punishment of the man in part by citing a previous sexual encounter between the two students, saying it was a ""mitigating factor,"" according to new materials obtained by HuffPost. The woman said the previous encounter, too, was nonconsensual, and asked for a separate investigation into that incident.KU opened the second sexual assault investigation in May 2014, and took more than 200 days to complete it -- even though federal guidelines say such investigations generally ought to take no more than 60 days. KU did not provide updates throughout the second investigation, according to the woman's family. The family believes the school may have delayed the second case because the woman had not been satisfied with the results of the first investigation.""We had no issue with IOA the first time around -- they were professional, they did their job,"" the woman's mother told HuffPost. (""IOA"" is the school's Institutional Opportunity & Access office, which handles investigations into sexual assault accusations.) ""The second time around, our interaction with IOA was completely different. It seemed they lacked neutrality from the start.""The school ultimately decided in its second investigation that the male student had done nothing wrong.The federal government got involved in July 2014, when OCR opened an investigation of the University of Kansas due to a complaint filed by the female student over the mild punishment of the male student.OCR's second ongoing investigation of KU, which it launched just last month, stems from a complaint alleging that administrators tried to get the female student to waive her federal privacy rights during the school's own second investigation -- the one that began in May 2014 and lasted more than half a year.As KU started that second investigation last spring, the university asked if the woman would sign a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act release form so that administrators could review her therapy records. Jane McQueeny, director of the university's IOA office and a former federal government staffer at OCR, said that investigators were searching for corroborating evidence beyond the woman's complaint. The woman's attorney told the university on May 19, 2014, that she ""decided the sanctity of her communications with her therapist should not be intruded upon,"" according to emails shared with HuffPost.""While I appreciate [the woman's] position on the release of her medical records this will make the investigation more difficult,"" replied McQueeny in an email. The woman's mother told HuffPost that KU's request for the therapy records felt to her like an attempt to ""discredit"" her daughter -- that she had the impression the school was hoping to find something in the records that it could then use against the woman.""The confidentiality of that relationship needs to be honored,"" the woman's mother said. ""Otherwise, students will not come forward.""The school told HuffPost in a statement that it ""works with complainants and respondents to get as much information as possible that would help him or her in regard to a sexual assault complaint.""""When medical or mental health documents are relevant and important evidence in the investigation, a complainant is given the option of executing a release to allow the investigator to review the records,"" the school said. ""At all times the complainant has control over what information he or she shares.""Victims' rights advocates have bristled at similar situations elsewhere, and experts have urged schools to be judicious about trying to access the medical records of alleged sexual assault victims.""Once you take confidentiality away [from counseling services], students stop coming,"" said Brian Mistler, associate dean of students and director of health services at Ringling College of Art and Design in Florida.However, Peter Lake, director of the Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy at Stetson University, speculated that requests like KU's to bypass privacy laws could be coming ""from a friendly place.""""It might be that an investigator thinks [the records] will help nail down the perpetrator that they believe committed the crime,"" Lake said. ""So it might feel oppositional, but it might not actually be oppositional.""According to the woman's family, in September 2014 -- following a HuffPost report about the first sexual assault case, but prior to the conclusion of the school's second investigation -- KU asked if the woman would like to sign a Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act release allowing the school to discuss her case with two media outlets. The university's lawyer warned the woman to use caution if she wished to agree to a FERPA release, and asked her to think about the ""potential impact.""The woman ultimately declined to sign the release. The University of Kansas told HuffPost it would never discuss a student's case without their permission.Lake said a situation like this demonstrates that HIPAA and FERPA were not created with ""any of these types of scenarios in mind"" and likely need to be reformed. ""I really feel for campuses, because they’re being asked to run a criminal justice-type system,"" Lake continued. ""But this one is largely closed off to public scrutiny because of rules written long ago, before the system even existed.""Need help?

""Otherwise, students will not come forward.""The school told HuffPost in a statement that it ""works with complainants and respondents to get as much information as possible that would help him or her in regard to a sexual assault complaint.""""When medical or mental health documents are relevant and important evidence in the investigation, a complainant is given the option of executing a release to allow the investigator to review the records,"" the school said. ""At all times the complainant has control over what information he or she shares.""Victims' rights advocates have bristled at similar situations elsewhere, and experts have urged schools to be judicious about trying to access the medical records of alleged sexual assault victims.""Once you take confidentiality away [from counseling services], students stop coming,"" said Brian Mistler, associate dean of students and director of health services at Ringling College of Art and Design in Florida.However, Peter Lake, director of the Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy at Stetson University, speculated that requests like KU's to bypass privacy laws could be coming ""from a friendly place.""""It might be that an investigator thinks [the records] will help nail down the perpetrator that they believe committed the crime,"" Lake said. ""So it might feel oppositional, but it might not actually be oppositional.""According to the woman's family, in September 2014 -- following a HuffPost report about the first sexual assault case, but prior to the conclusion of the school's second investigation -- KU asked if the woman would like to sign a Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act release allowing the school to discuss her case with two media outlets. The university's lawyer warned the woman to use caution if she wished to agree to a FERPA release, and asked her to think about the ""potential impact.""The woman ultimately declined to sign the release. The University of Kansas told HuffPost it would never discuss a student's case without their permission.Lake said a situation like this demonstrates that HIPAA and FERPA were not created with ""any of these types of scenarios in mind"" and likely need to be reformed. ""I really feel for campuses, because they’re being asked to run a criminal justice-type system,"" Lake continued. ""But this one is largely closed off to public scrutiny because of rules written long ago, before the system even existed.""Need help?

Obama's letter was in response to a New York Times Magazine cover story by Jim Rutenberg called ""A Dream Undone,"" which chronicled how opponents of the landmark Voting Rights Act, which celebrated its 50th anniversary on Aug. 6, have worked to unravel its gains. The feature highlighted the story of Rosanell Eaton, who was one of the first black voters to register in her North Carolina county in 1939. Eaton had memorized the Constitution's preamble in order to pass the test she was subjected to. But Eaton's ability to cast a ballot has recently been tested by a new government-issued photo identification requirement in the state; she and her daughter had to make nine trips to the Department of Motor Vehicles, totaling more than 250 miles of driving, to acquire the papers Eaton needed to obtain an accepted form of ID. Eaton served as a plaintiff in a trial over the states's new voting restrictions, which concluded last month. ""[The] article puts the recent push to restrict Americans’ voting rights in its proper context,"" Obama wrote. ""These efforts are not a sign that we have moved past the shameful history that led to the Voting Rights Act. Too often, they are rooted in that history. They remind us that progress does not come easy, but that it must be vigorously defended and built upon for ourselves and future generations."" Obama noted that the Voting Rights Act put an end to literacy tests and other forms of discrimination, leading to an immediate skyrocketing in the proportion of minority voters who were able to cast a ballot. However, the Supreme Court invalidated key sections of the act in 2013.""From the moment the ink was dry on the Voting Rights Act, there has been a concentrated effort to undermine this historic law and turn back the clock on its progress,"" Obama wrote. ""I am where I am today only because men and women like Rosanell Eaton refused to accept anything less than a full measure of equality,"" Obama added. ""Their efforts made our country a better place. It is now up to us to continue those efforts. Congress must restore the Voting Rights Act. Our state leaders and legislatures must make it easier -- not harder -- for more Americans to have their voices heard. Above all, we must exercise our right as citizens to vote, for the truth is that too often we disenfranchise ourselves."" Read Obama's entire letter to the editor here. "

Every Tuesday morning, Molina, a Mexican-American mother of two, would arrive at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and pray for her husband’s safe return to their home outside Philadelphia.Eventually, her husband, Israel, was released after an immigration judge ruled in his favor -- an outcome that Molina, 30, calls “a miracle.""“I made a promise to myself that whatever happened, I would keep going to church,"" she said. ""We can’t keep separating families -- mine or anyone else’s.”Now Molina, who runs a small Mexican grocery store and tortilleria in Norristown with her husband, wants to take her case to Pope Francis himself. On Sept. 23, the pope will meet with President Barack Obama as part of his six-day tour of Washington D.C., Philadelphia and New York. Molina is one of 100 immigrant women who plan to march nearly 100 miles for a prayer vigil outside the White House ahead of the pope’s visit. The weeklong march will begin Sept. 15 at the detention center where Israel was held, and will progress through Baltimore before arriving in Washington.“Everyone told me my husband was going to be deported, but one of the few things that kept me going was my faith,” said Molina, who came to the U.S. from Acapulco, Mexico, at age 7. She's currently in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and is a member of Juntos, a Philadelphia nonprofit that focuses on workers’ and immigrants’ rights. “Maybe Pope Francis will hear our call.”Immigration is just one of several issues that activists and church members alike hope the pope will address during his U.S. trip. Gay Catholics have petitioned the pope to talk about LGBT issues, and he’s also expected to address climate change, economic inequality and the role of the family. Francis has set a packed itinerary that includes visits to major churches and a seminary, an interfaith gathering at New York's September 11 Memorial & Museum, an outdoor Mass in Philadelphia and addresses to the United Nations and a joint session of Congress. The pope has spoken frequently and with compassion about the struggles of immigrants, and he's expected to address the topic again while in the U.S. Church officials have said the pope, who is from Argentina, will also speak in Spanish at many of his appearances. Spanish is the second most commonly spoken language in the U.S., and the first language of many of the nation’s immigrants.“The Bible says that God has no borders,” said Juana Flores, a 54-year-old Mexican-American woman and former Catholic nun who is flying from San Francisco to join the march. “We want him to say there should be an end to laws and policies separating families via arrests and deportations. We want him to talk about reform without restriction that lets people who are just trying to survive be here.”We Belong Together, a group whose backers include the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, is organizing the march and vigil, along with the #Not1More campaign and PICO, a national network of faith-based community activists. We Belong Together was formed in 2010 after the passage of Arizona’s controversial SB1070 law, and the group has staged demonstrations around the country and held a 48-hour fast on the National Mall. Many of the women who will march to the White House are now or have been employed as domestic workers, including house cleaners.“When I came to this country [in 1990], I came as a mom with two kids without papers, at a time when there were many raids happening in San Francisco. It was such a feeling of fear and powerlessness. Now as someone who has documents, I still live with the trauma of that time,” said Flores, a co-director of Mujeres Unidas y Activas, a grass-roots organization in San Francisco for Latina immigrants.“We really hope we can inspire the pope,"" Flores went on. ""We know the strength and power he has, and we also know how grave the situation is for many immigrants here in the U.S.”Also on HuffPost:"

12,POLITICS,Jeb Bush Super PAC Donors Also Spend Big To Influence Washington,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb-bush-super-pac_us_55ca586be4b0923c12be71c6,The possible GOP nominee has raised six- and seven-figure sums from groups with lobbyists waiting for him in D.C.,2015-08-12,<p>Donors from Wall Street and the sugar industry are just some of the big spenders giving money to Bush's super PAC.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ca59211700006e005673a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A number of donors giving eye-popping sums to a super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's presidential campaign are also major players in Washington's corporate lobbying scene. These groups and individuals are pushing the executive branch on a variety of issues -- including federal contract approval, loosened regulations and decreased scrutiny of their activities.At least 43 donors who have given $100,000 or more to Bush’s Right to Rise super PAC are connected to companies employing lobbyists in Washington. Another five are members of industry lobbying organizations with a presence in the capital. Dozens more donors from big companies that are lobbying the White House have also pooled large sums to contribute to the Bush super PAC.These donors account for at least $15 million of Right to Rise's $103 million haul. The super PAC has raised an additional $811,000 from lobbyists and lobbying firms.Since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision opened the door for unlimited donations from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals, the universe of groups accepting these contributions has increasingly crossed over with the universe of Washington influence-peddling. The ruling produced this effect, despite Justice Anthony Kennedy’s assertion in that decision that independent spending would not “give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.”“These are precisely the kind of contributions that the Supreme Court has long held can corrupt government decisions,” said Fred Wertheimer, president of the campaign finance reform advocacy group Democracy 21. “What we face here with the Bush super PAC and other PACs is donors with important economic interests in government decisions buying in early to establish their ability to obtain government policies they desire if the candidate they support wins.”Bush’s super PAC fundraising stands out, according to Wertheimer, as the candidate personally raised these funds before announcing his presidential bid. During this period, Bush claimed he was not a candidate as a strategy to evade campaign finance laws.“It’s always most dangerous when candidates are directly soliciting huge contributions because that creates a direct potential corrupting nexus between the candidate and the donor,” Wertheimer said.The Bush campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Bush's donors include Matthew Rose, the head of BNSF Railway, who donated $100,000 to Right to Rise. Michael Ward, the head of CSX Corporation, gave $125,000. Both railroad companies are engaged in a lobbying campaign targeting Congress and the executive branch, with the goal of stopping or slowing regulations on crude-by-rail trains that have experienced a high number of explosive crashes across the country.In 2014, the Federal Railroad Administration proposed a rule requiring two-person crews for crude-by-rail trains. The railroad industry opposes the rule, and the next president will be able to appoint new leadership at the agency that could halt the implementation of the regulations.The U.S. Sugar Corporation's charitable trust donated $505,000 to Bush's super PAC, while lobbying to continue federal sugar subsidies. The group has joined with other companies that use sugar and other sweeteners in their products to run a broad public relations campaign aimed at convincing policymakers and the public that sugar intake is not to blame for the nation's epidemic of obesity and diabetes. Coca-Cola chairman and CEO John Brock gave $50,000 to the Bush super PAC. The company has also funded studies that aim to shift the blame for obesity away from diet.As part of the sugar industry's campaign, trade groups are lobbying against new Department of Agriculture dietary guidelines stating that high levels of sugar intake are linked to unhealthy weight gain and increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and stroke.Ronald Perelman, the head of the private equity giant MacAndrews & Forbes and a $500,000 donor to Bush’s super PAC, is known for his heavy hand in the political influence game in Washington on behalf of the companies in which he's invested. Over the years, Perelman has contributed to members of both parties, come under investigation for his pursuit of federal contracts and placed former staffers and wives of political figures on his payroll. Companies controlled by Perelman’s MacAndrews & Forbes -- including defense contractors and vaccine makers -- received $16 billion in federal contracts from 2007 to 2012, according to the Sunlight Foundation’s Fixed Fortunes database.Private equity investors like Perelman also take advantage of a tax code that favors them through a low carried-interest tax rate and incentives for leveraged buyouts. And Perelman is by no means the only private equity investor giving to Right to Rise.Stephen Schwarzman, head of the Blackstone Group, the largest private equity investor in the world, gave $100,000. The firm's senior managing director, Michael Chae, gave $150,000. Kravis Kohlberg Roberts’ Alexander Navab and Joseph Plumeri combined to give $750,000. Cerberus Capital Management head Stephen Feinberg donated $200,000, and Apollo Management’s Leon Black gave $100,000. All have hefty lobbying operations in Washington to support the companies they own and to push for low investment taxation and looser financial rules.Big Wall Street financial firms that benefitted from the 2008-2009 bailouts and have since found themselves under constant Department of Justice investigation are also huge donors to Bush’s super PAC.Forty-five bankers and executives at Barclays, the British bank that pleaded guilty to rate manipulation in May, contributed $541,261 to Right to Rise. Managing Director Stephen Lessing, formerly of Lehman Brothers, led Barclays with donations totaling $276,763. Nine high-level executives at Goldman Sachs contributed $291,000 to the Bush super PAC. Bank of America Merrill Lynch Chief Operating Officer Thomas Montag gave $100,000, while another 19 high-level directors chipped in an additional $109,500. Executives from J.P. Morgan Chase, including former Chairman and CEO William Harrison, contributed $55,760, and those from Morgan Stanley gave $48,250.These banks have all been lobbying to loosen Dodd-Frank regulations on the banking industry. Bush supports repealing the law passed in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown.Right to Rise has also received $100,000 from the Florida-based private prison operator The GEO Group. During his two terms as governor of Florida, Bush was a big supporter of the privatization of prisons, aiding the company's growth. The GEO Group is now lobbying at the federal level on criminal justice reforms pursued by both parties. The company states that it advocates for public-private partnerships for prisoner reentry, rehabilitation and diversion programs. At the same time, the company tells investors that it’s profits would take a hit from laxer criminal enforcement. An investor filing by The GEO Group, first noted by FirstLook’s Lee Fang, states that the company’s profits “could be adversely affected” by “the relaxation of criminal or immigration enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction, sentencing or deportation practices, and the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws or the loosening of immigration laws.” This includes “the decriminalization of drugs,” any reduction in crime rates and the passage of immigration reform laws.Private prison companies including the GEO Group have also pushed at the federal level for an expansion of private immigration prisons, and the industry has pushed at the state level for restrictive immigration laws.While Bush's immigration reform proposals do include policies supported by private prison operators -- including an increase in surveillance and detention at the border and cutting off funding for sanctuary cities -- he also supports some path to legalization for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. The GEO Group and other companies like it do not.This is not the only area where Bush's policies run counter to the lobbying agendas of some of his big super PAC donors.CIT Group CEO John Thain donated $200,000 to Right to Rise. The company has lobbied in 2015 in support of the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. Bush stated in May that he opposed funding the federal bank.Carnival Cruise Lines CEO and Miami Heat owner Micky Arison, a $500,000 donor, and Royal Caribbean Cruises head Richard Fain, a $100,000 donor, are both seeking to gain cruise boat access to Cuba as the Obama administration ends the decades-long travel embargo on the communist country. Carnival’s Cuba-bound cruises have already been approved by the U.S. government, while Royal Caribbean is looking into the prospect. Bush is a fierce opponent of normalizing relations with Cuba.Some of the policy agenda of NextEra Energy, the parent company of Florida Power & Light, is also aligned against Bush’s stated priorities. The utility company lobbies in support of wind production and renewable energy tax credits, but Bush has called for phasing out all energy tax credits -- including those for renewables like wind and solar, and those for traditional energy sources like oil and gas.CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to include a statement from The GEO Group and to more clearly reflect its lobbying activities."

He was impressed by what he saw and signed onto the initiative.“The flowers looked good, which is the key thing, but I was really happy to support their effort,” Dyme told The Huffington Post. “It’s a great way for us to buy local flowers, a huge priority for our business, and to support this innovative rehabilitation program simultaneously was a win-win.”Funds received from the partnership go back to the jail’s inmate welfare fund, which supports rehabilitative programming, including the urban farming initiative, culinary classes and other vocational programs.A significant portion -- 25 percent -- of profits made by Flowers for Dreams are donated to Chicago-area nonprofit groups, such as, this year, Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, the Boys and Girls Clubs, RefugeeOne and One Tail at a Time Dog Rescue.Dyme said, later this month, the company will reach a total of $100,000 in donations to charity groups since launching in 2012 -- a milestone he calls “probably our most important accomplishment.”By the year’s end, he expects to hit $120,000 in donations as business is growing. According to a Chicago Tribune story, sales have tripled since 2014 to about $1.5 million through this spring.Flowers from the garden and other products of the farming initiative -- including fresh produce, eggs from the farm’s chicken coop and honey from its beehives -- are also sold to local restaurant partners like Yusho, A10 and Billy Sunday, as well as at the popular weekly farmers’ markets at Daley Plaza, DNAinfo Chicago reported this summer, generating revenue that allows the programs to continue.The initiative has also led to employment opportunities for some participating inmates. According to the jail, eight have gone on to work at restaurants or landscaping companies upon their release.Education and vocational programs like Cook County Jail’s urban farm initiative not only improve inmates’ chances of finding a job after their sentence are up, but also, according to a 2013 report from the RAND Corporation, significantly reduce their chances of becoming incarcerated again. In addition, the same analysis found that such programs are cost-effective, though more research is needed to determine the types of correctional education that produce the best results.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story included an incorrect last name for the Cook County Jail farming initiative's deputy director.

Bob Corker, (R-Tenn.) and ranking member Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) crafted the congressional review process for the Iran deal. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Of all the senators on the fence about the deal President Barack Obama struck with world powers on Iran’s nuclear program, perhaps none is being more closely scrutinized than Ben Cardin.The Maryland Democrat is known by colleagues as good-natured and thoughtful, not prone to shouldering the pressure of high-pitched legislative battles. But that’s precisely where he finds himself in August as the president’s biggest foreign policy initiative gets ready for a tough vote in Congress.Officials in the administration and on the Hill say that Cardin, more than almost any other senator, has the capacity to alter perceptions of the deal. Unlike his more hawkish colleagues, his position is likely to be perceived as more merit-based than political. And because he occupies the post of ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- the committee with chief oversight of the diplomatic efforts to engage Iran -- the symbolism of his endorsement or rejection will be amplified.“If there is ever a game changer, it will be when somebody announces that they are going to vote in an unexpected way,” explained Aaron Keyak, managing director and co-founder of the firm Bluelight Strategies and former interim executive director for the National Jewish Democratic Council. “If there will ever be a change in that reality, someone like Cardin will have to come out against the deal. ... There are other senators who are looking to him and it will have a greater impact if he does something unexpected.”Those following the political fate of the deal profess cluelessness about where Cardin is currently leaning. One top congressional aide -- who, like others, agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the talks -- expected Cardin to back the agreement since he’s balked at military confrontation in the past, notably voting against the Iraq War authorization in 2002. Another anticipated he’d oppose the deal because of his status as one of the top-ranking Jewish lawmakers.“I think he is genuinely torn and doesn’t know which way to go,” said a third senate Democratic aide.That he's ended up the focal point of intense speculation is, in part, by chance. Cardin, who has served in Congress since 1987, only became the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) stepped down from that post following his indictment for allegedly taking donor kickbacks for political favors.Menendez, a vehement critic of the diplomatic entreaty with Iran, speculated that the administration wanted him out of the post. But Cardin wasn't exactly a pushover. Rather than upend a campaign to give Congress more oversight on the Iran deal, he worked with Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) to modify the proposal. The resulting legislation met many of the administration's demands. But the simple act of giving lawmakers a vote on the final nuclear agreement was a concession the president didn't want to make.""People felt he was an honest broker during that and we had good communications,"" conceded a senior administration official.Now fully in the congressional oversight period that he himself negotiated, Cardin is coy about where he stands. And his office would offer only the usual, unhelpful bromides to explain his thinking: “He’s studying the details,” “reading everything there is to read” and “reaching out to the experts” while also “talking to his constituents” before making up his mind.“He is certainly being lobbied on all sides,” said Sue Walitsky, his spokesperson. “He has joked he has talked to the president more in the last few months than all presidents before that combined.”Even though there is mounting pressure for him to weigh in sooner, Cardin likely won't make a decision until after Labor Day, Walitsky said. And that alone has supporters worried. The conventional wisdom is that lawmakers should and will vote their conscious and not at the behest of any specific interest group or colleague. But the lobbying campaign against the agreement is better financed and well placed.Sen. Chuck Schumer's (D-N.Y.) opposition to the deal, in particular, has spooked supporters. Though he claimed he wouldn't whip against the measure, the New York Democrat is making phone calls to colleagues to explain his vote against the deal, which, as pointed out by several Democrats, is the basic definition of whipping. ""In that respect Schumer is potentially more dangerous than Cardin because I think he is going to spend the next five weeks seeing if there is any possibility that the deal can be killed,"" said a Democratic aide.Still, not everyone is convinced that the defection of someone long suspected to oppose the deal will torpedo it, even if that person is set to become the next Senate Democratic leader. The current leader, Sen. Harry Reid (Nev.), has not yet said how he'll vote and has similar influence within the ranks to Schumer. And Cardin, as a perceived honest arbiter, still will provide or deny his imprimatur on the deal's substance.""In the end it really wasn't surprising that Sen. Schumer declared his opposition to the deal,"" said Jim Manley, a former top spokesman for Reid. ""The more interesting dynamic involves Sen. Cardin and what he is going to do as the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."""

What explains coffee's laxative effect? As a new video (above) from the American Chemical Society's ""Reactions"" series says, this poo-effect used to be chalked up to caffeine, which is a known laxative. But it turns out there's more to the story.It seems that coffee causes the stomach to ramp up its production of gastric acid. This, in turn, can cause the stomach to quickly dump its contents into the intestines.Other factors may contribute as well: coffee can induce rhythmic contractions in the intestines and raise levels of the hormones cholecystokinin and gastric, which kick-start the colon.Talk about getting a jolt from your java!"
18,POLITICS,"Bernie Sanders Sees Growing National Support, Boost In New Hampshire Polls",Janie Velencia and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-surpasses-hillary-clinton-new-hampshire_us_55cad74de4b0923c12bea8c0,A new poll finds Sanders closing the gap in New Hampshire.,2015-08-12,"<p>Presidential candidate Sen. <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/bernie-sanders"">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.)</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55cad7d81d00006e001448ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is surging across the country, as his improbable bid for the Democratic nomination for president draws ever-larger crowds in critical early states. Growing from the hundreds to the thousands to the tens of thousands, the audience size has been matched with some key endorsements, including the 185,000-member National Nurses United this week.The union's executive director, RoseAnn DeMoro, told The Huffington Post that Sanders had earned the support of NNU's board and had won by a wide margin in a poll of membership.""We were stunned by the results,"" DeMoro said. ""It was so overwhelming for Bernie Sanders.""Now, the enthusiasm for Sanders' campaign is also reflected in at least one new survey, which shows him for the first time pulling slightly ahead of Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire's Democratic primary.In a Franklin Pierce-Boston Herald poll released late Tuesday night, Sanders leads his Democratic rival with 44 percent to Clinton's 37 percent, within the survey's margin of error. Vice President Joe Biden, who has not entered the race, places third, with 9 percent of the vote, and all other Democratic candidates place below 1 percent.Polls this far out from an election tend to be suspect when it comes to predicting a winner, but the poll, combined with endorsements and on-the-ground energy, reflects a real groundswell for the self-described democratic socialist.Support for Sanders in New Hampshire has jumped 36 percentage points in five months -- he had just 8 percent in a Franklin Pierce-Boston Herald poll conducted in March. Although a majority of New Hampshire Democrats see Clinton as the most likely nominee, only 35 percent say they are enthusiastic about her. Fifty-one percent say they could support her, but are not excited about her run.Comparatively, only 11 percent of likely Democratic voters say they could see Sanders as the eventual nominee. Still, he captures greater enthusiasm among Democrats -- 44 percent say they're excited for Sanders' candidacy, and 36 percent say they ""support some of his ideas"" but don't think he could win in the general election.While Clinton's lead against Sanders has narrowed in recent months, this latest poll is the first to show Sanders ahead of Clinton during this election cycle in New Hampshire. A UNH/WMUR poll conducted at the end of July had Sanders trailing Clinton by 6 percent in the state, and no other survey to date has shown her with less than a 4-point lead. HuffPost Pollster, which aggregates all publicly available polls, now shows the two candidates effectively tied in New Hampshire, with Sanders at about 41 percent, and Clinton at just over 42 percent.Primary polling conducted this early can pick up a wave of enthusiasm for a candidate, but it's less useful as a predictor of who'll actually end up winning. At this time in the runup to 2012, Rick Perry was briefly spiking to the top, both nationally and in the Iowa Republican caucus. In the 2008 campaign, Clinton held a commanding national lead and John Edwards looked set to dominate in Iowa's Democratic caucus.The Clinton campaign has long been concerned that Sanders could perform well in New Hampshire, which borders his home state of Vermont and responds to a New Englander approach to politics that doesn't necessarily resonate as well in places such as Iowa.Sanders has also gained support in Iowa in recent months, but by a narrower margin. He trails Clinton by nearly 27 percentage points in that state, according to HuffPost Pollster's average. Nationally, Clinton continues to hold a commanding lead.The Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald poll surveyed 442 likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters through live interviews via landline and cell phone on August 7 through 10.  Correction:  A previous version of this story implied that Hillary Clinton and John Edwards ran in the 2012 presidential elections. They ran in 2008."
