0,BUSINESS,Does Your Marketing Plan Need an Exit Strategy?,"Scott MacFarland, ContributorChief Content Marketer and Digital Strategist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/does-your-marketing-plan-_b_6808986.html,"Marketers and small business owners rarely think about the terms, ""Marketing Plan"" and ""Exit Strategy"" and use them in the same sentence.",2015-03-06,2015-03-05-1425573097-1983446-HP_MarketingPlan.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-05-1425573097-1983446-HP_MarketingPlan-thumb.png,"Marketers and small business owners rarely think about the terms, ""Marketing Plan"" and ""Exit Strategy"" and use them in the same sentence. Individually these are talked about frequently in business circles and both have incredible value when executed correctly. I would like to combine these to see if there is merit in leveraging the definition and outcomes of each. Believe it or not, both of these have a similar result that is the culmination of the strategy and hard work it takes to accomplish their goals. Hmm... can they really coexist to help businesses perform at higher level? Should marketers think differently in order to perform at a higher level? --I think we're on to something.The Marketing Plan: A marketing plan is a strategic and tactical blueprint that's aligned with business goals. The plan is implemented using a variety of digital and traditional channels. (SEM, SEO, advertising, content marketing, blogs, TV, display, retargeting, text campaigns, print, trade shows... you get the idea.) A marketing plan's goal is designed to expose the brand in ways that capture qualified leads that result in a sale. Simple right? Let's move on.The Exit Strategy: As business owners build their business, they know that the end result is ""selling"" the business, not owning it and keeping it indefinitely. Because the goal is to sell the business to another person or company, the strategic plan may be similar in how they capture new clients and increase sales. Most likely there is a re-established plan that outlines how the current owners plan on making sure they show a number that represents maximum customer lifetime value or total revenue, both can translate into selling the business for top dollar - all in the right time of course. Why Do These Concepts Need To Co-Exist? I feel both of these are very similar in that the end goal is to sell. But there's more. An exit strategy typically has a time window associated with it and sometimes the strategy within that time must change in order to stay on track to sell the business. In marketing, sometimes we don't think about an exit strategy because marketing continues, sales continue and it is a self-perpetuating activity that hopefully continues the way we need it to increase sales. I am suggesting that as marketers, we need to think of our customer conversion activities as an ""exit strategy."" We need to be ready to make adjustments in order to ensure our goals are met - convert a high percentage or create a certain number of qualified leads for our sales team to close the deal. This is challenging, especially if you are in a business that has a long sales cycle. The Marketing Exit Strategy The marketing exit strategy needs to be well defined so that all employees fully understand the end-goal. It cannot be an ambiguous thought like ""we want to sell lots of product."" You marketing may be an important ingredient to aid in selling, but there's more to just selling lots of product.You may also want to define the marketing exit strategy with a goal in mind that has a number attached to it. Think about, who are your customers? Where are they in the sales funnel? What defines them as a qualified customer? What product or service are they highly interested in? Why are they interested in it? Are they ready to purchase now? These are just a few questions that need to be answered so that your marketing ""exit strategy"" can perform like a well-oiled machine. Your marketing exit strategy should be tied to all leads that enter the sales funnel and more importantly, qualified leads that get submitted to the sales team. We can even take this a step further and tie all marketing to content ROI or even monthly sales. Whatever works for your team, just make sure your entire team knows what the marketing exit strategy is, what initiatives impact the exit strategy the most, and how they play an important role in order to make the marketing strategy effectively ""sell.""

1,RELIGION,An Atheist's Perspective on the Rise of Christian Transhumanism,"Zoltan Istvan, ContributorLibertarian candidate for California Governor; Creator of Immo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-atheists-perspective-o_b_6802140.html,"Transhumanism is not a religion, nor is it in competition with religion. It is simply a mode of being that embraces evolving the human being with science, reason, and technology.",2015-03-06,2015-03-04-1425501047-9806967-Astronaut_Mike_Hopkins_on_Dec._24_Spacewalk.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-04-1425501047-9806967-Astronaut_Mike_Hopkins_on_Dec._24_Spacewalk-thumb.jpg," We are already transhumanists: A NASA astronaut in space -- Photo by NASARecently, a number of religious transhumanists -- those who advocate for using science, technology, and religion to improve the human being -- have reached out to me, asking whether I plan to maintain my atheist position as both an outspoken transhumanist and a 2016 U.S. Presidential candidate. Frankly, it's a good question, since America is mostly a Christian nation with mostly religious politicians -- and to make real headway in U.S. politics, it's going to be difficult to do it as a declared atheist. Even if some of my friends and political advisors suggest it, it's too late for me to do a U-turn on some of my atheistic positions. I've written too many pro-atheist articles and given too many secular-themed speeches. And recently, I helped start the world's first atheist orphanage, which via crowdfunding became fully funded in only 29 hours.However, I decided to write this bridge-building article because one Christian reverend, Christopher Benek, called me and told me he believed America was ready to start merging Christianity with transhumanism. Some people, including conservative Christians, may find that asinine, but I tend to agree with the reverend. I've said this before: In order for existing formal religion to survive in the 21st Century, it will have to bend and evolve to fit coming technological advancement. Technology is simply too powerful and all-encompassing to not make one's beliefs work with it. Robot pastors, churches in Virtual Reality, debates about a Jesus Singularity, and saving Artificial Intelligences via Christ's redemption are likely going to be a meaningful part of this nation's future, whether religious old-timers disagree or conservative writers like Wesley J. Smith make light of it. Smith recently wrote in the National Review, ""Every once in a while, when the world is too much with me, I turn to transhumanist advocacy for a little entertainment.""My own history with religion is varied. I was raised a Catholic (even went to Catholic elementary school). In high school I was more interested in general Christianity, as well as Buddhism. Later, I partially majored in religion in college and even took a month to read the Bible cover to cover. In fact, my departure from Christianity began in earnest the moment after I finished reading the Bible. I was 18-years-old, and it simply contained too many contradictions, too much violence, and too much foreshadowing of the future -- a future that certainly didn't anticipate humans merging with machines, artificial super intelligence, post-genderism, brain implants, robotic hearts, ectogenesis, telepathy, or the multitude of bizarre transhumanist technologies on the horizon (or already here). That said, many parts of the Gospel of Jesus, broadly interpreted, remain an important part of my moral code. Clearly the intent of Jesus to get in touch with the spiritual possibility of the universe was a major improvement over the strict and ritualistic religiosity of the time. However, despite my admiration of Jesus and some of his teachings, it's incredibly hard to see how anyone can reasonably believe a human being came down to Earth and died for the world's sins, or that a loving omnipotent God could send people to an eternal hell of suffering, or that billions of non-Christians in the world might never get to heaven because they haven't accepted Christ into their heart. The key word in that last sentence is 'reasonably.' I agree with many neuroscientists that it's our ability to reason that makes human beings so special. Without it, we would be living like our primate cousins and would never have come to understand the complexity and power of the human mind -- or its incredible potential.As a transhumanist, I stand behind reason, first and foremost. Most transhumanists feel the same way. Our code belongs to science and the scientific method. We require proof, before anything else. We do understand that our so-called 'proof' can always change, by new discoveries. But proof, which only a reasoning human being can verify through logic, measurable evidence, and scientific repetition, must occur. Otherwise, we'd all be able to believe anything and everything unconditionally, regardless how silly, wrong, or illogical it might be. And that would lead us to a place where we are unable to discern truth or prove it -- a place where we are left to rely on faith. This is the overarching component of Christianity and other Abrahamic religions -- a thing which most Americans have broadly accepted. And it will be a key issue that Christians must reconcile with as our society becomes more science and technology bound -- fields which rely on reason.Moving forward, I welcome Christians and their worldviews to embrace transhumanism. There is much verse in the Bible that supports humans improving themselves -- which is the essence of transhumanism. So, ultimately, we all have much in common. And I also welcome Christians to seek ways to apply their religious views and biblical verses to transhumanist philosophy and ideology, which will result in a better, healthier, more prosperous America. Transhumanism is not a religion, nor is it in competition with religion. It is simply a mode of being that embraces evolving the human being with science, reason, and technology."

Sederer, MD We enter this film by viewing one pair of the characters who charmed many a heart in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. We see a T-Bird convertible racing along Highway 66 in southern California, not South Asia. The truly odd couple of Maggie Smith (who plays the British dowager Muriel Donnelly) and Dev Patel (as Sonny Kapoor the hotelier from Jaipur, India) have come to America in pursuit of financing for a second hotel in what could surely be a chain to rival Hilton, only for those of old(er) age seeking the comforts and care unaffordable to them in their native, Western lands. They are enroute to meet with corporate titans who might deign to underwrite their also odd business endeavor.The return viewer to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel might wonder if the unexpected and considerable box office gold of the original film can be struck again and, indeed, if the aging British boomers (and before) in the film can also find a second coming in their golden years. And therein lies the heart of both movies, namely taking a lucid and kindly look at aging.Actress Bette Davis famously said, ""Getting old is not for sissies."" She may have failed to emphasize that there is little choice if you want a life, since being a sissy is not a good strategy for managing the bully of older age.In the original film, seven Brits, singles and pairs, facing retirement conclude their banking accounts cannot meet the financial demands of a decent dotage (with one notable exception, whose motives unfold as the first story is told). Their paths collide in Jaipur, once home to Rajasthan rulers, at a hotel they have chosen on the basis of its internet claims as a blissful, and affordable, residence (with outsourced health care to boot) in a distant and exotic world. Their ebullient hotel host is Sonny Kapoor, who first exploded into film fame in Slumdog Millionaire. The British grey hairs, Sonny, his girlfriend and widowed mother, and a cast of attentive Indians altogether pursue the ageless quest of reviving broken down bodies and a rebuilding the ruins of lodgings they call The Best Exotic Marigold Hotels.The plot of The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (no one presumably knew that a comma would have helped after 'Second') adds a number of new actors and a variety of inescapable human dilemmas that happen when we try to build lives and communities amidst a universe given to entropy. But the 'second' best never really strays from its theme, about what it takes to age well. The new additions to the cast include Richard Gere, David Strathairn, and Lavinia Beech, adding even more heft to an ensemble of acting royalty, which includes Dame Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith, Dev Patel, and others who are headliners in South Asia.John Madden returns to direct the sequel, and has the setting, cast, and story to do the job. He is a master of the stage (e.g., the Pulitzer-winning Proof) and now seems right at home filming the gorgeous hues, sounds, congestion, and mild chaos of Indian urban life. We don't see the extremes of poverty and pain, but that is not what this film is about. It is about finding ways to have a good life, all our life, especially if we have a 'good enough' social station to do so, whether we are born of the East or the West.Sonny and Maggie get two American corporate fish on the hook who might invest in their second best hotel. Sonny, as well, is about to get married to the gorgeous Sunaina (Tina Desai), who is as grounded as he is boundless. Other couplings among the elders struggle, as couples often do regardless of age. Competition abounds in business and love. The narrative knots around rivalry, fears of taking life by its horns, families and their tumult and tsurus (heartache -- not a Hindi word), and how victory might be snatched from those we want to achieve it.But this is ultimately the ""Best,"" whether first or second, and we are taken on a journey where knots are made to be untied, lives meant to touch one another, and business to prosper because of the people who spawn it. The film is true to the heartening Indian expression: ""Everything will be all right in the end. So if it is not all right, it is not yet the end."" We even get to go to a ""big, fat Indian wedding,"" choreographed to the hilt of a Bollywood production.  Yet as warm is the story, as saturated is the film's color palate, and as engaging its characters, we know time is not on our side when it comes to aging. Love, friendship, and purpose are the ingredients to the secret sauce of a good life -- at any age. But they are harder to achieve as life calcifies, infirmity saps strength, and outrageous fortune batters and sometimes embitters our souls. The bully of old age cannot be eluded, only faced and mastered. (For more on aging well, see ""Bucket Lists and Other Signs of Aging Well."")If life is a game of cards, the question then is do I play another hand? In The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, the resounding answer is ""count me in.""========  Dr. Sederer's book for families who have a member with a mental illness is The Family Guide to Mental Health Care (Foreword by Glenn Close) - now available in paperback.

A widening array of worries has cost them that cover.",2015-03-06,"MIAMI, FL - SEPTEMBER 23: In this photo illustration, the General Mills cereal Lucky Charms is seen on September 23, 2014 in Miami, Florida. During a share holders meeting tomorrow, General Mills investors are being given the opportunity to vote on whether the company should remove genetically modified organisms from its products. (Photo Illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e988c2100003300c5fe24.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the latest educational music video for kids produced by my non-profit, my own 15-year-old son, our front man, essentially asks the question: if multicolored marshmallows in a cereal box are part of a complete breakfast, what part IS that?By posing the question, I think he is also answering the one Kellogg's seems to be asking, namely: what happened to us? How did we lose control of the American breakfast?That story is elaborated in a Bloomberg Business profile that chronicles the century-spanning rise, and recent fall, of Tony the Tiger, Toucan Sam, and the rest of the menagerie. I defer to the business experts on the sociocultural trends that figure in Kellogg's travails, such as working mothers, smaller families, and breakfasts preferentially eaten on the run.From my perspective, at least some of the answers are just about as blatant as the psychedelic glow of those marshmallows in my son's lyric.There has been a tremendous concentration of attention over recent years to the adverse health effects of miscellaneous food adulterations, from the general harms of added sugar, to the specific ills of high-fructose corn syrup; to the liabilities of refined grains; to the potential harms of food chemicals; to the insidious (and ill-defined) menace of genetic modification; to the willful sabotage of appetite control with hyper-processed concoctions. When dietary worry was all directed at excess fat intake, pseudo-fruit (Kellogg's makes Froot-Loops and Apple Jacks) and multicolored marshmallows (actually, General Mills makes Lucky Charms) were able to fly under the radar. A widening array of worries has cost them that cover.There is also a movement under way to expunge the magical thinking attached to added nutrients. Historically, food companies have applied vitamins and minerals much like lipstick on a pig: whatever the general character of the product, it would introduce itself with bold assertions about fortification. The banner ad across the front of the package, like some honorific bandolier, never says: ""my first ingredient is added sugar!"" true though that may be. It is far more likely to say something about ""essential nutrients!""That, in fact, is the basis for the classic marketing line: ""part of a complete breakfast!"" The typical TV commercial for a kid's cereal features multicolored, madly frenetic antics -- followed by the sonorous voice of an announcer, presumably allaying the concerns of mom or dad: ""fortified with 11 essential vitamins and minerals, part of a complete breakfast."" The inevitable juxtaposition of the two assertions implies that the latter follows naturally from the former. In other words, our concoction deserves to be part of your family's ""complete breakfast"" because, after all, it is fortified with these very important nutrients.But as I have been motivated to opine before, nutrient additions to a vat of gloop cannot exonerate the gloop. The new book, Vitamania, by Catherine Price, about which she and I recently corresponded, apparently develops the same theme.So the public has learned that low-fat does not a wholesome food make; and that nutrient additions to junk produce, well, nutrient-fortified junk.And that's where a whole lot of breakfast cereals fall. Kellogg's is by no means alone in those dietary badlands.The result is that health-conscious eaters are likely rejecting cereals they formerly embraced -- and they are quite right to do so. Eaters that aren't at all health conscious weren't eating cereal in the first place -- they were having donuts, Danish, and muffins; or maybe sausage and egg sandwiches. Either way, they are probably uninterested in cereal.Personally, I am an inveterate cereal eater, but have long favored the exceptionally wholesome offerings of especially virtuous companies. My standard choice most days is one of the whole grain offerings of Nature's Path, a cereal line noteworthy for purity, and simplicity, with minimal additions of sugar, salt, or anything else unwelcome -- and maximal preservation of the native grain nutrients. My very favorite product of theirs, a cereal called Synergy, is no longer available in the U.S., because I was apparently the only one down here eating it! It is made from eight whole grains, with no added sugar and no added salt. I guess it was a bit like cardboard to the typical American palate, but my taste buds don't have that unfortunate condition, and I loved the stuff.I have long been a fan of KIND for their simple and wholesome bars, and have embraced their cereal line for the same reasons. There are others, too, including Wholesome Goodness, a company I advise on nutrition; and some of Kashi's offerings (Kashi is owned by Kellogg); and so on. But most of the cereals that cater to the prevailing American palate have far too much added sugar and salt for my taste. Many popular (or formerly popular?) cereal brands have more added salt, relative to calories, than almost anything in the salty snack aisle (go ahead -- check the nutrition facts panels). The only reason they don't taste overtly salty to most Americans is because (a) the salt is masked by even more copious additions of sugar; and (b) the typical American's taste buds are in a sugar- and salt-induced coma. Perhaps that's changing, to Kellogg's apparent dismay.Of the dubious concoctions over which we poured our milk all these years, the cereals preferentially marketed to children are by far the worst. How we ever got the idea that ""junk"" could be food, I'll never know; but that we then got the idea that the junkiest of all foods could be ""kid"" food is utterly astounding. Food is the one and only construction material for the growing bodies of children we love. How does ""junk"" sound now? Apparently, less good. Perhaps health conscious parents are seeing past the bright glow of that lipstick at last.To the extent that Kellogg's lost breakfast -- and I'm not sure the final chapter has yet been written -- it is because they were playing the wrong game for much of the past five decades or so. They, along with all of the others in this same space, were looking for best ways to put makeup on a pig, rather than looking for ways to make up the best, most nutritious formulations.They lost the game because we finally caught on, and figured out what game they had been playing -- and who was actually losing.-finDavid L.

Like most people, I've had my fair share of sleepless nights. But one of the most immediate benefits I noticed once I started my daily meditation practice was my ability to sleep more peacefully and consistently through the night. In addition, I find that a nightly routine is important. While I'm no sleep expert, I have discovered a few things that are helpful for setting up for the perfect snooze. 1. Wash away the day  We are energy magnets throughout the day -- both the good vibes and the not so good. For me, I like to physically wash the day away as well as visualize releasing any energy that is no longer necessary literally going down the drain. Mindful tip:  Whether washing your face or taking a shower or bath, take a moment to visualize the water clearing away the energy of the day. As you dry yourself off, take a few intentional deep breaths. 2. Choose a ritual  Whether lighting a candle, enjoying a cup of tea, burning some incense or playing relaxing music, choose a physical act to prep your space and mark the act of entering the sleep zone. I have a selection of scented sprays that are simply a combination of essential oils and water. I like to use the lavender or rose spray to both energetically clear and infuse a relaxing vibe.Mindful tip:  Treat yourself to your an intentional (and visual) ""turn down"" service. As you move the pillows, fold back the covers, etc, visualize yourself having an uninterrupted and peaceful night's sleep. 3. Power down  No surprise that experts encourage us to power down in the evening. For me, I try to power down at least two hours before I intend to go to bed. But let's be honest, it simply doesn't always happen, so I try to at least choose the technologies where I can let the work day go (i.e.: my laptop, checking email, Facebook, etc). That way, if I just HAVE to watch one more episode of House of Cards before I go to bed or if I want to listen to relaxing music or a guided meditation, then I am at least using the technology intentionally. Mindful tip:  Whether or not you are able to power down right before bedtime, be mindful to take at least 5 deep relaxing breaths as you lay your head down for the night. 4. Cultivate gratitude  Practicing gratitude in the evening is a great way to put our day into perspective. You can write it down or simply think it to yourself. Mindful Tip:  Write down or think of three things you are grateful for. I usually think of one thing I am grateful for about a loved one, one thing about someone I may be experiencing a challenging time with, and one thing for myself.Paige Davis is an entrepreneur, wellness enthusiast, and certified meditation teacher with the McLean Meditation Institute.

I want her to tell me about it, to show me what the colors look like through her eyes. I don't ever, ever want to make her feel wrong for what she believes, or less-than for seeing it differently than I do.",2015-03-06,2015-03-05-1425523234-4422148-PhotoFeb28111554AM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-05-1425523234-4422148-PhotoFeb28111554AM-thumb.png,"When my sister sent me the text last Thursday night, I had no idea about The Dress. Even though I use social media on and off throughout the day, I had shut down my laptop several hours earlier and managed to stay offline, not even peeking at Facebook on my phone during the pre-dinner witching hour, as I am sometimes guilty of doing.If I had so much as glanced at social media that afternoon, I would have seen the seemingly instantaneous explosion of viral insanity that was #TheDress, and it all would have played out differently. But I didn't, and so when my sister asked me what colors I saw in the dress, I shot back a quick reply without a clue what it was all about.As I cleared the dinner dishes, my husband got a similar text from my sister's boyfriend. It seemed we'd been dragged into a couple's debate over a dress -- or so we thought. Bryan said the dress was blue and gold (which puts him, we later learned, into a rare subcategory of people that make up just 6% of the dress-viewing population) and I told him he was crazy, that the lace was obviously black. That's when we brought the kids into the debate. ""It's white, and kind of orange,"" said my 6-year-old daughter. ""Orangy-yellow? Gold-ish."" My 4-year-old son agreed. ""White and yellow,"" he said firmly.""White?"" I challenged. ""You mean blue."" I zoomed in on the picture on my phone, focusing on the flat panel of fabric near the dress's shoulder, a swath of deep indigo unobstructed by lace or pleats. ""This is blue.""""No, mommy,"" said my daughter. ""It's white.""""Look right here,"" I insisted, pointing to the screen. ""This section. You don't see blue?"" I felt flustered, unsure what the joke was and why I was at the butt of it. I felt oddly unhinged, and definitely irritated.""No, mommy. I see the shadows there, but it's not blue. It's white."" ""Are you joking with me? Are you doing this on purpose to be funny?"" I asked. She is, after all, a bit of a prankster sometimes. Was she testing me? Or pushing my buttons to get attention? It didn't make sense. ""Mommy, NO. I promise! I see white,"" she pleaded. Her round eyes begged me to believe her. We looked at each other then, locked in disagreement, each of us searching the other's face for signs of acquiescence and finding none. You're wrong, my expression told her. I don't understand you, and you're wrong.""Okay, but I don't get it,"" I said, walking away. ""I feel like I'm going crazy.""The next hour passed without mention of The Dress and we went through the familiar choreography of a weeknight winding down. I put the baby to bed first, my husband read to our 4-year-old, and I crawled into bed with the oldest for the final act. I read Anne of Green Gables aloud and we talked about the following day and weekend ahead. I kissed her goodnight, shut the door, and came downstairs to find my husband leaning against the kitchen counter looking at his phone.""So, this whole dress thing...it's, like, a THING,"" he said. ""It's all over the Internet, and some people see white and gold. Others see blue and black.""Some people see white and gold. Others see blue and black. In our family, we do our best to respect differences, to celebrate diversity. We teach our kids to listen to one another's opinions, even when they differ from their own, and to engage in healthy debate when they feel strongly about something. We tell them that all beliefs are okay, and that the world is more interesting because there are so many different ways to view it. We ask them never to make someone feel less valuable because of who they are or what they believe.And yet, I saw blue and black. I didn't know it was a photoshopped Internet sensation. I just knew I was right, and she -- my 6-year-old -- was wrong. We weren't talking about fifty shades of periwinkle here, or debating the definition of indigo -- we saw two completely different things. In that moment between math homework and dishes and a thousand text messages and 42 other things going on in the background, I made exactly zero space in my brain for the possibility that we might both be right. And I let her know that.""I'll be right back,"" I told my husband.I tiptoed upstairs and opened her door. ""It's just me,"" I whispered. ""I have to tell you something. You know that dress? It's kind of like a magic trick, an optical illusion, and there are tons of people who see white and gold, just like you do. And some other people see blue, like I do.""""I'm sorry I made you feel wrong,"" I continued. ""I couldn't understand why you didn't see what I was seeing. It made me feel like I was crazy. But you know what? We are both right. It's okay to see things differently. I love you.""""Love you, too, Mommy,"" she said, rolling over into a nest of blankets and stuffed animals. ""'Night.""We're both rather fond of absolutes, she and I. I'm a firstborn, and she is my firstborn, so we come by it honestly. We cling to rules and like figuring things out. And while these first half-dozen years have afforded me the position of mostly passing my worldview on to her, the years that remain will be, necessarily, much less one-sided. She is bright and brave and opinionated, and I want her to be so. I want her to give voice to the way the world looks to her, even when it goes against the grain or rubs right up against the edge of status quo. More than anything I want her to feel like that voice carries weight, has value, and can make things happen.I want her to see white and gold. I want her to tell me about it, to show me what the colors look like through her eyes. I don't ever, ever want to make her feel wrong for what she believes, or less-than for seeing it differently than I do. And when in the years to come we come to a point of impasse, when the white-and-gold she sees cannot reconcile with my blue-and-black point of view, I don't ever want to shake my head and walk away. I want to be able to look her in the eyes and say, ""You know what? Maybe we're both right. It's okay to see things differently. I love you.""

8,TASTE,"""Only the Best of Hemp"" for Your...Gelato?","Regina Varolli, ContributorAuthor, '99 Things You Wish You Knew Before Going To Culinary ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/only-the-best-of-hemp-for_b_6805070.html,,2015-03-06,2015-03-05-1425523202-7498536-OneLoveMec3Campaign.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-05-1425523202-7498536-OneLoveMec3Campaign-thumb.jpg,"Don't be surprised when the newest flavor at your local gelateria is cannabis, because Italian gelato and pastry products giant MEC3 of Rimini, Italy has just released its ""One Love"" gelato mix on the US market. Call it cannabis or marijuana or hemp... a gelato flavor by any name tastes just as sweet, and with an ad campaign that includes tag lines like, ""The Revolution Is In Your Gelato Shop"" and ""Only the Best of Hemp,"" MEC3 is poised to create quite a stir from this mix. One Love Hemp Gelato Ad Campaign  (Image courtesy MEC3)At SIGEP in Rimini, the world's largest trade show for gelato, MEC3 premiered the new hemp flavor to the tunes of Bob Marley and record-breaking crowds of curious gelato (and pot?) lovers. Having sampled the flavor at SIGEP, I was surprised by its subtle yet unmistakable taste, more than just a novelty, it's nutty and herbaceous and actually very good. So I decided to sit down with the affable MEC3 Director Gian Maria Emendatori, son of founder Giordano Emendatori, to talk about the revolution.Emendatori explained that while the gelato does have the flavor of marijuana, it has no THC, and includes only cannabis sativa seeds, no other part of the plant is used. Sharing what he thought when ""someone"" brought him the seeds ""to taste out of curiosity"" he exclaimed, ""I was really amazed by the flavor! It has a taste somewhere in between pine nuts and walnuts. So I said, ""we've got to do something with this product and we decided, maybe as a joke, to launch it in our shops.""  MEC3 Ad Campaign for its Dolce Bio shops: ""Flavor of the Month: Hemp...The most sophisticated and unique taste."" Gian Maria Emendatori explained, ""We don't use the leaf in the ads anymore because it's only the seeds in the product."" (Image courtesy MEC3)Creating an ad campaign invoking all things hippie, MEC3 tested the market by releasing an organic version in its own Dolce Bio organic gelato shops in Italy. The public response was overwhelmingly positive. ""It immediately became the biggest seller. People were lining up out the doors to get it!""After much testing in the kitchen-labs, what started as a simple test mix added to their Fior di Latte flavor is now a unique flavor mix that includes whole hemp seeds and is enhanced with vanilla and caramelized brown sugar. ""It's really something amazing,"" declared the animated Emendatori proudly. ""We really studied the flavor!"" MEC3 One Love Hemp Gelato mix with seeds that give it a ""granular and crunchy consistency"" (Regina Varolli)Matching the ""subtle and delicate"" nuances of the sativa seeds with a sauce developed for One Love, it was a must-sample at SIGEP. By noon on the day of this interview, already 2,000 people had tried it. ""We have never given away so much of one gelato flavor at any expo in 30 years. We consider it our best, most interesting and most important product."" Gian Maria had high expectations, but its popularity exceeded them. ""I was sure the product would encounter big success, but honestly not this big.""   One Love Hemp Gelato drizzled with its complimentary crushed cacao nib and sativa seed chocolate sauce  (Photo courtesy MEC3)The interview got quite amusing at times. How can anyone talk about and taste cannabis gelato, Bob Marley beats in the background, without talking about marijuana itself? The laid-back Gian Maria played along, ""Well, you know, there's a big rumor about hemp... But,"" he reiterated while maintaining a mischievous smile, ""all of the THC is removed from the seeds, so the product is perfectly legal."" Then he glanced side to side and leaned in, grinning, ""I did this on purpose, because we have removed all the THC and it's stashed at my house."" My reply, ""Where do you live?"" At SIGEP in Rimini, Italy, MEC3 Director Gian Maria Emendatori enjoys a cup of THC-free One Love Hemp Gelato (Regina Varolli)With the legalization of marijuana now in three states in the US, and medical marijuana in twenty-three plus Washington D.C., the whole concept of cannabis is becoming normalized and the product mainstreamed, with or without the THC. It's a well-timed move for MEC3 to bring the revolution to your gelateria. While Director Emendatori was clear that ""One Love gelato mix will never have any THC in it,"" who is to say a gelato-maker in Colorado or Washington can't spike this tasty THC-free mix and create their own, perfectly legal, adult version?Regina Varolli is the author of 99 Things You Wish You Knew Before Going To Culinary School, praised by Bobby Flay as ""an answer to every question I've ever gotten about cooking schools."""

You'll recognize Elvis from his numerous roles in five Spike Lee films including the recently released Da Sweet Blood of Jesus. Elvis' Twitter: @EONolasco . Photo by Elise Gannett.It was easy for me to come up with questions to interview the multi-talented and ever so handsome Elvis Nolasco. There's just something about the way he carries himself that makes me want to [censored]! Eeeps! But so true!You HAVE to check Elvis out in his new show American Crime which airs in the coveted Thursday night slot after Scandal.Let's see what this guy Elvis Nolasco has to say.In American Crime, you play an addict named Carter Nix. What type of research did you do for this role?Well, having grown up in New York City's neighborhoods, it was not a far-fetched or stretch to witness addiction on different levels. To have been able to witness the behaviors, struggles and destruction was something I was able to draw from. YouTube was very helpful in doing research on the effects and behaviors of addiction.Do you still know how to breakdance? What about poppin'? What's your favorite move?This is a good question. It's never the same case when it comes to remembering how to still ride a bike. Break dancing can do a lot of wear and tear on the body, something I've experienced throughout the years. However, I still got some moves, I'm still swift and limber. As a New Yorker I will never turn away from a battle. My favorite move would have to be classic footwork and windmill.What's your workout and food routine?I love to run and hike, cardio is of major importance to me. I also enjoy hitting the weights and calisthenics every now and them for muscle building and strength. I enjoy eating egg whites and oatmeal for breakfast, lots of fruits and vegetables, salads, salmon, steak, grilled chicken and turkey. However, if my mom is around I'm definitely having me some liver and white rice (my favorite dish). My two good friends have been instrumental in helping me train and workout properly (Kamar De Los Reyes & Ben Velazquez at The New York SportsLab).Tell us about the @SpikeLee Sneaker Jam. What did you do there? How'd you get an audition for the Spike Lee film Da Sweet Blood of Jesus?Spike Lee's NBA Sneaker Jam? Just went out to have a good time, pow wow with all the 40 Acres and A Mule Team. Da Sweet Blood Of Jesus is a different and uniquely told love story about people who are addicted to blood, it's a re-imagination of Bill Gunns 70's hit Ganga and Hess. I was in L.A. when I first received a phone call about my availability to come on board for Da Sweet Blood Of Jesus and the details of the project. I answered that call by saying one, yes I'm available and two I like the project very much. The second call I received, the voice on the other line (will remain anonymous) said ""Pack Your Bags"".What's it like playing opposite of such a hot actress Caitlin Gerard in American Crime? Tell us about the first time you met her. @CaitlinGerard As you just described her, not only is she hot but Caitlin is also a very talented actress. I knew from the moment I tested with her, I felt that the chemistry and understanding of the characters was on point, Caitlin brings it and it's such a joy to have taken this journey with her. When I was given notice that I was cast as Carter Nix, based on what had happened in that audition room (chemistry) I had a gut feeling that Caitlin Gerard would be Carter's Aubry Taylor.What type of after school activities did you do as a kid?Lots of them...theater, baseball, street two hand touch football, lots of roller-skating and ice skating at Laskers Rink Central Park, swimming, acrobats and break dancing. As you can see physicality was a major part of me growing up, and still is.You recently wrote a short film called Invisible Wounds and will also direct. What type of research / schooling did you do to learn how to direct? Please let us know more about the production side of Invisible Wounds.To be able to watch and listen to Spike Lee and John Ridley like a hawk, I ask questions and take notes. I've been fortunate to be around some amazing directors, D.P.s and various levels of productions throughout the years, so I've pick up some quality information along the way. I've directed theatre and I've worked as a teaching artist for many years, all these experiences combined have given me the confidence and knowledge in moving forward in directing my first short Invisible Wounds. It's very early in the process, however I wrote the story with my good friend and fellow break dancer Luis Dalmasy. It's a story very relevant to today's and yesterday's war veteran issues. Issues like adjusting to civilian life and for many of them the dependence of prescription medication to deal with life on life's terms. My younger brother (Yanko) is a former military man who served our country in the Iraq war, he in turn is my personal adviser on the project. I'm reaching out to investors and or crowd funding to fund the project.Do you find yourself being stereotyped into roles?Stereotyping? Good question. I could honestly say that early on in my career that was something that I was able to recognize and therefore mid-way through this journey I chose to stick to theater for a while (which is my foundation). I've always considered myself and my art to come from a very diverse place, so it has always been of the utmost importance to stretch my art and personal growth so that I'm not placed in that box...(stereotypes). You're a true New Yorker. Share a story from your childhood about growing up in the city and how it's affected your life today.While in J.H.S. Joan Of Arc, growing up in the midst of the break dancing, graffiti and rap music explosion. On lunch breaks, myself and founding members of the renowned graffiti group I.B.M (Incredible Bombing Masters), Dino Morales (POKE) & George Morillo (SEN ONE). One day we were standing on the corner of 91th street and Broadway. While standing on this corner one by one my friends started to disappear, to my ignorance, I didn't realize that they were all going down these steps that lead us to the old abandoned 91th street station where we discovered a graffiti artists' paradise. This very old station was the canvas to throw up your piece and it then would be displayed for all the One train riders to view as the train would cruise from 96th street to 86th street stations. Something only a New Yorker would know about. As a Native New Yorker growing up in such a fast paced city, I've learned to be fearless, courageous, to interact with people from diverse backgrounds and know that ""No one opens the door for a Native New Yorker""...(wise words from the group Odyssey). I do strongly feel that these experiences have a strong effect on me, my character and the truth.Anything else you'd like to say?At this point In my life and career, I'm just filled with gratitude. Promoting Da Sweet Blood Of Jesus and American Crime at the moment is where my focus is at. On February 21st I was invited to participate in a celebration of the life and times of Malcolm X at The Shabazz Center (Washington Heights), this date marks the 50th anniversary of Malcolm's assassination . As part of the event I was asked to read Malcolm X's last letter; It's truly an honor to be invited. Shout-out to the cast and crew of American Crime & Da Sweet Blood Of Jesus. Shout-out to my fam and peeps in Washington Heights."

Then, inspired by my father's legacy, I created The James Jay Dudley Luce Foundation five years ago. Last week we celebrated these two decades of service at the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations, honoring the second year of Luce Scholars, the fifth year of Luce Leaders, and the fifteenth year of Humanitarians. Luce Leader Seal-Bin Han with the Hon. Jumaane Williams, Dr. William Bauer,  the author, and Dr. Ralph DePalo. Photo: Annie Watt/Stewardship Report.Our Luce Leaders include Seal-Bin Han, a sophomore at Johns Hopkins University studying electrical and computer engineering as a Bloomberg Scholar; Jamil Patacon Fuller, a freshman on scholarship to Lawrence University; Alana Morgan Galloway, a junior at Convent of the Sacred Heart High School in Greenwich; and Eugenie Carys de Silva, who graduated with a Master's degree from Harvard at the age of sixteen. Seal-Bin Han is dedicated to finding a new paradigm for philanthropy, Jamil hopes to use his talents to heal the world, Alana focuses on specific social problems including bullying and teen suicide, human trafficking and prison reform, while Eugenie strives to use education to better humanity. I have written about or with most of the young leaders in this publication. See: A Young Global Leader at Johns Hopkins, Young Global Leader Embraces Prison Reform, and Young Global Leader Nabs Harvard Master's Degree... at 16.Each Luce Leader was given tools for improvement. These included four books, two of which I have reviewed here: Frank Perdue: Tough Man, Tender Chicken (Mitzi Perdue), The Sufi's Garland (Manav Sachdeva Maasoom, our poet laureate), Management: Fearless Leadership in a Social World (Alison Fine), and Dreams of My Mothers: A Story of Love Transcendent (Joel L. A. Peterson). To remain humble and retain a sense of humor, they also received a special Build-a-Bear that the company's founder Maxine Clark had created for each young leader based on their profile.

Although the subject of human trafficking is not a happy one, the knowledge that there are dedicated students (and talented writers) like you seeking to raise the level of societal understanding of this issue keeps me motivated. I am very pleased to see that the J. Luce Foundation has recognized your work as exemplifying their mission of honoring young leaders working to better humanity.We have begun a scholarship program known as J. Luce Scholars to provide financial awards to undergraduate and graduate students for academic and/or living expenses in the U.S. Our 2014 Awardee was Jamil Patacon Fuller and our 2015 Awardees are Yu ""Jeff"" Guan and Jeremy Leung.The author with the Herath family - brother Ramin, parents Sunil and Nayana,  and four-year old Dylan.

Luce foundation is a wonderful venue for young adult global leaders to spark their cognitive curiosity, creativity, and 'caringness' in bettering the human condition."" Orphans International Worldwide and our foundation have a long history of acknowledging the efforts of individuals who have dedicated their lives to the betterment of humanity.

I was surprised there are only three countries--Jamaica, Colombia and Saint Lucia--where you are more likely to have a female rather than a male boss. Among developed nations, the United States ranks 15th with 42.7 percent women in managerial positions followed by Australia ranking 36th, Britain at 41, Germany at 55 and Japan coming in at 96. Pakistan ranks at the bottom with only 3 percent of women in managerial positions. The report also lists the most common barriers to women becoming leaders, including that women tend to have more family responsibilities than men, they suffer from stereotypes and lower social status in many countries, and they lack access to leadership training and other opportunities to develop their skills and knowledge. In my role as Global CEO of Opportunity International, I've found the greatest challenge facing women in places like Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Philippines is lack of access to basic financial services such as loans and saving accounts. About 90 percent of our 10 million clients in 22 countries are women. Through loans, business training and other financial services, we help them launch and expand businesses to break the cycle of poverty, transform their lives and strengthen their families and communities. One of the things I like most about my work is traveling to Africa, the Philippines and other areas in the developing world to meet clients and see our programs in action. One amazing woman I met recently is Neetu, a young entrepreneur in the Badarpur area of New Delhi, India. Neetu enjoys sewing and had an idea for a company that manufactures seat covers. But her husband and in-laws told her to stop dreaming. They knew none of the local banks would give her a loan to start a business and told her they didn't think she'd be successful anyway. But Neetu believed in herself--and we believed in her. Over the next four years, we gave her three loans totaling about $950 and today her business is booming. Best of all, she's creating jobs in her community and now even employs her husband and his mother and father. Investing in economic opportunities for women like Neetu in developing countries is not just a moral imperative to promote equal opportunity, it's a smart business decision. Closing the gender gap can increase a developing country's GDP by up to 16 percent, according to the 2012 Global Gender Gap report by the World Economic Forum. That means more jobs, more spending and a healthier economy.Sunday is International Women's Day, a time to celebrate and promote the contributions of women in the world. As important, it's a reminder--along with the International Labour Organization report--that there is still a great deal of work to be done to develop women leaders and bring more women into the global economy to the benefit of communities, countries and all the world. Vicki Escarra is Global CEO of Opportunity International, which has set a goal of creating 20 million jobs by the year 2020, impacting 100 million lives around the world. "
13,ENTERTAINMENT,Hip-Hop and Religion With Bun B and Professor Pinn,"Azeem Khan, ContributorIndependent Consultant",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hiphop-and-religion-with-_b_6810028.html,Hip Hop and religion are not two things that seem to have much of a connection to each other to the average person. Professor Anthony Pinn of Rice University has based 20+ years on it though.,2015-03-06,2015-03-05-1425580236-8886551-AnthonyPinnCasualimage.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-05-1425580236-8886551-AnthonyPinnCasualimage-thumb.jpg," Photo Credit: Roberta MagriniHip Hop and religion are not two things that seem to have much of a connection to each other to the average person. Professor Anthony Pinn of Rice University has based 20+ years on it though. When he started teaching at Rice University he wanted to have an artist he admired in the classroom to join him. One of his PhD students was able to reach out to the legendary Houston rapper, Bun B to get him as a guest lecturer. Things went so well that they started teaching the class together. Since 2011, the unlikely duo has been teaching the most popular class at Rice University on this exact subject. In fact, the class has been so successful that they are now translating into a free online course. It will be available later this month for anyone to take because of the demand they could not fulfill within the classroom. Recently I had a chance to sit down with both of them to talk a bit about their experience together. Professor Anthony Pinn received his PhD from Harvard. He has been teaching bout hip-hop and religion since. He believes hip-hop and religion are much more similar than people realize. First, preachers and hip hop artists share an understanding that stories matter. Both of them do their work in a way that is compelling and draws people in. He realizes that the moral and ethical vision of hip-hop may run contrary to the idealized vision of religion. But he also believes that in both contexts people are just trying to do the best they can in a world that is not perfect. When he got to Rice University he wanted to start bringing actual artists into the classroom. He felt it would be a more authentic voice to spread the message. A PhD student of Professor Pinn was able to reach out to Bun B, and get him to agree to guest lecture a class. Things went so well he decided to take on a full time position. Bun B said that he had never imagined being an educator in an academic setting, citing,""I enjoy my day job, but after guest speaking they asked if I would consider coming into the classroom to share it with Doc. I had to give it deep thought to doing something like this. I don't want him or me to look stupid. I had to evaluate if I was willing to do the work to get it done. But looked at it like, if I can do this, it will inspire kids, but what this says about how hip-hop lives and breathes made me want to do it. I knew it would be a lot of hard work, and I knew it would be not paying well. But it felt right and here we are.""The class has been a hit since it started. One of the most interesting things they noticed was the demographics of their class versus that of the university at large. The gender, racial, and religious diversity could not be better. On top of that, they have students from every major imaginable. They have also noticed that the female voice in the classroom has gotten stronger each year, which they have enjoyed.  Photo Credit: Roberta Mangrini The decision to start teaching this as an online course was not sudden. They had been thinking about it for a while, but wanted to do it in a way that did not affect the authenticity of it. From the start the class has filled to capacity so that was not it. What made them want to offer this online course were people from other parts of Texas, and even other parts of America asking about it. Professor Pinn said, ""For me, especially from the urban community, people have an interest with this. But they're like, 'Well, I'd love to take your course, but I'm never going to be able to go to Rice University'. Others are outside the conventional college age from. Bun and I realized this gave them an opportunity to see things even though the class is somewhat truncated.""To help remedy this problem they decided an online class was best. Putting together the online course was difficult when they realized it was not going to be in the classroom. They wanted different stations depending on what they were teaching. Figuring out logistics for all the places was difficult because of coordinating everyone's schedules. When they were talking about Islam they wanted to be in a mosque. According to them, it was not just about the spoken word that was important, but it the space it where the speaking was taking place as well.Bun B and Professor Pinn are taking things a day at a time. It took them three years to bring the online course to fruition, and now want to see what the reception of the online version will be. They stressed their desire for the class to keep its integrity as it spreads. That is something they are not willing to compromise. They do have a book coming out in May, and have had talks about a documentary as well. Where things go from here will be dependent on how they feel though.It is amazing where hip-hop has extended its reaches. It started out as a creative outlet for young kids in urban neighborhoods. Then it became an art form that affected people in every part of the globe. Now it is in the academic realm in more abstract ways. Hip-hop is a living and breathing organism that is everywhere, and will only continue to thrive. One thing is for sure; it is exciting to imagine where it will show its head next."

Soon after, members of the Brahman (high caste) family I'd married into began literacy classes for women. My teacher husband trained two young woman as facilitators. They used drawings to highlight a key word, prompt discussions, and generate other words that participants learned to write and read. The first word: Kam. Work. ""What work do men do?"" the facilitators asked.""Plow...thresh...lay bricks...read books,"" the 15 or so participants shouted back. They were mostly landless agricultural laborers in our village, but also included several higher caste women.""What work do women do?""The women all talked at once: ""Plant...weed...harvest...thresh...winnow...carry firewood and fodder...milk the buffaloes... cook...clean...give birth...breastfeed."" Given more time, they could have gone on and on. As a foreigner and a family breadwinner, I was exempt from what local culture deemed women's work and not considered ritually pure enough to cook meals for my Brahman father-in-law. Still, I was exhausted from breastfeeding, interviewing and note-taking for my PhD research, helping to clean vegetables and wash dishes and tending a fussy baby who never let me sleep more than an hour or two at a time. But I couldn't keep up with my mother-in-law and sister-in-law. They woke before sunrise most mornings then milked buffaloes, heated the milk, skimmed off the cream, churned butter, made tea, popped corn, swept, picked stones out of rice and lentils, cut vegetables, hand-ground spices, cooked the morning meal, washed dishes at the water pump, laundered clothes, weeded vegetable beds, repaired earthen plasters, directed the children to finish homework or help with chores, walked long distances to cut grass for livestock and carried it back home on their backs, cooked an afternoon snack of chapatis and chutney, mended family clothes, fed the buffaloes, shelled peas, cleaned kerosene lanterns, harvested and washed vegetables, picked stones out of rice and lentils and ground spices yet again, cooked the evening meal, washed dishes, swept the kitchen and verandah, put children to bed.Landless women who lived in a colony near our house worked even harder. Many belonged to lower castes. They also rose early and perhaps breastfed a child and swept the courtyard before first light. Then -- often on empty stomachs -- they walked to a landowner's farm such as ours for a day of weeding corn or planting rice. In some arrangements, they received meals -- perhaps their only full meal of the day. If they didn't have work-meal contracts, they might eat some rice, salt and chilies back in their hut at night.Women in the literary classes discussed other hardships they'd suffered themselves or heard about in other families: beatings by husbands, lack of say in their families, harassment in public spaces, medical treatment and food denied to young wives especially after giving birth to a second or third daughter, heavy work right up until delivery and soon after, lack of income and inheritance rights, pressures to take young daughters out of school and force them into early marriage. Not all families treated women in such ways. But enough did that women in our village organized the first local celebration of International Women's Day in March 1988 and launched a campaign to demand changes.Perhaps because I'd had a difficult pregnancy and delivery, many women in our village often took breaks from their daily tasks to visit and tell me privately about their reproductive health problems: lower back pain, a sense of things sliding out ""down below,"" pain during sex, irritation when urinating or walking. I wondered how women endured such chronic pain with no breaks from their heavy work loads and wished I could help. But I was a cultural anthropologist researching social inequality, not a medical doctor. I had some layperson health books, like David Werner's Where There is No Doctor yet was out of my depth around any but the most straightforward complications. Aside from urging women to consult with doctors (which many refused to do because of expense and past humiliations), I didn't have any solutions. I now suspect uterine prolapse caused at least some of those symptoms women described to me. Afflicting at least 10% of Nepal's 13.6 million women, uterine prolapse is a weakening of the muscles and ligaments in the pelvic floor, which allows the uterus to slip partially or wholly into the vagina. Worldwide, uterine prolapse is usually an affliction of older women. But in Nepal, it is prevalent among young women too. Recent research initiated by Nepali activists and health care workers pinpoints the cause: gender discrimination, particularly women's restricted choices around sexuality and reproduction. Heavy work like women in our village talked about in 1987-88 is one aspect. But early marriage and pregnancy, closely-spaced pregnancies, malnutrition and domestic violence all compound the toll that work takes on women. And those causes are often rooted in cultural practices, particularly in some Hindu castes.According to a recent Amnesty International Report, ""Unnecessary Burden: Gender Discrimination and Uterine Prolapse in Nepal,"" many women try to hide the painful symptoms of uterine prolapse not only out of shame but also out of fear of scoldings and beatings. Yet, chronic pain makes it hard for women to keep up with chores, and a women who seems to be slacking off becomes vulnerable to violence or abandonment. Nepali women's organizations have a long history of fighting for women's rights at national, regional and village levels. The government has also ratified a number of global human rights agreements, including those that require women to be free from all forms of discrimination and violence and to be able control their sexuality and make their own choices about reproduction. Leveraging such protections, Nepali feminists and others pressured the government to view uterine prolapse not just as a health problem, but as a human rights concern. In 2008, the Supreme Court recognized the human rights dimension and charged relevant ministries to take action. The court ruling led to increased funding for surgeries and various prenatal health initiatives but did not challenge the discrimination that causes uterine prolapse. And the focus on surgery led to what some doctors claim were unnecessary hysterectomies.Since the ten-year civil war ended in 2006, Nepal's government has been struggling for stability, unable to reach agreement and action on many urgent issues, including a constitution that many hope will secure equal rights not only for women but also for those marginalized by caste, ethnicity, geography, religion or sexual orientation. Through the ups and downs of successive regimes, activists--both women and men--continue to keep uterine prolapse in the spotlight. Most recently, they gathered 125,000 signatures from Nepal and two dozen other countries petitioning the government of Nepal to recognize uterine prolapse as a human rights issue and to adopt effective plans to tackle the gender discrimination that both causes and results from it. Officials received the petition in May 2014 with some assurances that the demands would be considered in upcoming efforts to draft a national human rights plan. Meanwhile, health care advocates continue working on multiple fronts. For example, while continuing to call attention to underlying causes, Dr. Aruna Uprety and her organization Rural Health Education Service Trust (RHEST) run health camps in rural areas to educate women about reproductive health and treat problems. For early stages of uterine prolapse, RHEST conducts minor surgeries and also provides inexpensive pessary rings to hold the uterus in place. Deliberations on a countrywide human rights plan as well as a constitution continue in Nepal. Whatever laws and policies are enacted, implementation across multiple agencies to address multiple, deep-rooted cultural practices will be challenging. But, no matter the outcome, Nepali feminists, human rights activists and health care workers will no doubt keep up the pressure to treat both the symptoms and underlying causes of uterine prolapse.For more information:""Unnecessary Burden: Gender Discrimination and Uterine Prolapse in Nepal"" (Amnesty International, 2014)  Launch of Amnesty International's Report on Nepal ""The Hidden Agony of Nepalese Women"" (Al Jazeera)Rethinking Nepal's Uterine Prolapse Treatment (Relief Web)"

Warner through his foudation, Make a Wish Foundation, and other sponsors arranged for ten families of ill children to accompany him and his family to Disney World parks. (AP Photo/Marc Serota)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e99842400003200540e0c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Gratitude is the process of appreciating what is and letting go of what is not. My children will be on spring break in a few weeks, which started me thinking about the trip we took last spring to Disneyworld. The first two days were a lot of fun. We also took a detour to Universal Studios to visit the Harry Potter attractions and just enjoyed our time together as a family. On the third day, my older daughter woke up nauseous and I thought it would just pass, so we headed to the amusement park. By 2 p.m., we were running to the hotel room for what turned out to be a stomach virus. My husband headed back to the park with my younger daughter and there I was in my hotel room at Disneyworld with my older daughter feeling just awful.As I squeezed myself out the door onto our small balcony overlooking the giraffes (we stayed at the Animal Kingdom), I could hear several children laughing and having a great time. I felt my mood start to drop and had the following thoughts: It's not fair that those children get to enjoy Disneyworld and we don't; I can't believe we spent all of this money to sit in this room; and This is the worst vacation ever. As I let myself dip further and further into this mood, I started to suffer greatly. As I felt myself slipping, I actually asked myself out loud, ""Do I really want to have this experience with this mindset? I am in a lot of emotional pain."" I took a deep breath and decided to accept my situation, be grateful for what I had and make the best of it. This shift in my mindset changed everything.Many of us have read articles and posts about gratitude, acceptance and ""making the best of a situation,"" but we find it hard to actually do it. One of the reasons it is sometimes difficult to shift our mindset is because we are disappointed that we are not getting what we want in the moment. We get stuck in traffic, someone rejects us, we have to work more than we expected, our children need help with their homework, but we have something else we want or need to do, or the weather is not cooperating. Life is not going as planned, and we are angry and upset.Yet, in these moments, we have a choice to shift our perspective. For me, when I made the choice to see it differently, all of a sudden, I felt joy. How could I be joyous sitting in a small dark hotel room with an animal motif with my child feeling sick? I knew her stomach virus would pass and I did not want to give up another moment of life complaining that things were not working out as planned. We put on the television and watched reruns of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,"" ""Castle"" and a few other shows that I cannot even remember. We talked and laughed in between moments of her not feeling well. The next day my younger one woke up not feeling so good and we did it all again. It was not my preference to be sitting in the hotel room, but I felt peaceful and content to be with them. They did rally back the following day and we returned to the amusement park. They whined a bit about nausea and we only went on a few rides, but we had some laughs and enjoyed the fireworks.The day we were leaving, we had some time to spare because it was raining. I took a deep sigh of relief that everyone felt OK and we would be headed home in a few hours. I then heard beeping on my phone. There was a tornado warning in our immediate area and we were directed to seek immediate shelter. Instead of thinking this is a lousy end to a difficult vacation, we took cover in a nice restaurant and ended up having a great lunch!So today, whatever you are experiencing, ask yourself, ""Is my mindset causing me emotional pain? Can I accept this situation and be grateful for what is in my life? Is there a way to 'make the best of it' and choose joy instead of negativity?"" It's not always easy, but often with some effort we can find the path to get the most out of each moment in life."

As an activist, I have been well aware of the tide of violence against women worldwide, but lately, it is within the smallest of spaces, the subtlest of intent that I find myself more outraged at how the culture of violence intertwines with sexism, misogyny, patriarchy, chauvinism and male privilege to affect how others may view and interact with women, even when we are more knowledgeable on a topic. It then becomes the responsibility of men that become more enlightened to check those that resist female agency to operate in a space however she sees fit. Not long ago, I had a conversation among three men that I'll name John, Gabriel and Mike that disturbed me. John, Gabriel, Mike and I were having a lengthy discussion that involved a well-known celebrity who had a public history of domestic violence.  John: "".... I think I was once watching a show where a celebrity admitted that he hit his wife harder than he hit any of his opponents in the ring.""The conversation continued to spiral downward from there. I was ridiculed, dismissed, talked down to and subtly threatened to be quiet by Mike to let him have the last word. I refused to back down just because Mike said so. John eventually voiced that he found the celebrity statement sick and that I was not being heard and the conversation shut down from there. Just like that, one man changed the flow of conversation. None of the men thought that the conversation was worthy of unpacking the sentiment behind their words -- like the subtle sexism in making domestic violence a woman's issue, or the not-so-subtle chauvinism that Mike used to dismiss my feelings or even the misogyny of laughing at the prevalence of women dying at alarming rates -- until John spoke up. It was an emotionally draining defeat for me, seeing patriarchy came into play where my voice more or less had to be validated by another man to get other men to consider my points. Yet, the reality was, they did not reach the other men without it.The struggle to transform the beliefs and behaviors of some men are affected by reigning attitudes left unchecked and biased education services that hardly ever challenge the constructs of masculinity in a conversation with men and women. There is a space where conventional activist methods just does not translate to the very ones that do not think the voice, body or even abilities of a woman are worth more than the lowest sum of her parts. Work with these types of men by other men need to be a focus as the movements of gender justice for women moves forward."

It is a great movie about a police robot named Chappie that is downloaded with a program that makes him self-aware.,2015-03-06,2015-03-05-1425589559-17870-chappieChappieFinalPoster.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-05-1425589559-17870-chappieChappieFinalPoster-thumb.jpg,"I was fortunate enough to be invited to a screening and press conference for the movie Chappie. It is a great movie about a police robot named Chappie that is downloaded with a program that makes him self-aware.At the press conference, Neill Blomkamp, the director, script writer, and the guy who came up with the idea for the movie, said he wasn't sure if humanity could ever produce the type of artificial intelligence (AI) in Chappie. I was curious if that was possible myself.In order to answer that question, I was able to interview the founder and director of the Visual and Autonomous Exploration Systems Research Laboratory at Caltech and at the University of Arizona, Dr. Wolfgang Fink. He is working on building an autonomous "" planetary field geologist"" robot for NASA.Alejandro Rojas: How would you define an autonomous exploration system?Dr. Wolfgang Fink: A truly autonomous exploration system is not controlled at all by humans. It may be given a charter, for example, ""Go out there and explore a planet and then report back once you see something exciting."" Humans always tell the robots what to do, so far, and that is the part where my lab tries to make a difference, so the robot or the system comes up with the decision where to go next and what to explore.Rojas: So, coming up with the decision, or the reasoning aspect, would you call that artificial intelligence?Fink: I would not, and that is very important. The term artificial intelligence refers to, over the last several decades, a largely rule based system, so called Mamdani type rules. What it means is if you encounter a certain type of situation, then react a certain way. If you encounter another situation, react another way. So if you have thousands of these rules in a system, then it looks like as if the system was intelligent looking from the outside in. However, the problem with such an approach is, while it is applicable and sufficient for certain tasks, especially tasks where we know everything that could happen, there are no surprises, but it doesn't lend itself to when there are surprises or a heavily changing dynamic environment.In this case, with Chappie, for example, now you have a system that has been instilled with the capability of modifying itself, modifying its thinking and learning over time, and being influenced by its environment. Now that is the mark of an autonomous system, because at this point you cannot really predict anymore what trajectory or development the system will take in the future.Rojas: So, you are saying that Chappie is more along the lines of using autonomous reasoning rather than artificial intelligence.Fink: Yes. We have a nice comparison with the police robots, and Chappie was one of those. So the police robots, while they are highly automated, and many people would call them also autonomous, they are more governed by an artificial intelligence, because they have the law and order book internalized. They know if someone is wrongly parked, they give them a ticket, if someone pulls a gun, they pull a gun, and so they work according to certain schemes and a certain set of actions.However, Chappie, in severe contrast to this, is not governed by the artificial intelligence rules. He is basically developing over time, being taught like a child. The culmination of which, at some point, he says, ""I am Chappie."" That is a huge statement, because that means at that point he becomes self-aware. That is sort of the highest order and the true mark of an autonomous system. Rojas: Do you think self-awareness is possible?Fink: Yes, I believe it is possible, but not with the current AI approaches. It has to be vastly different than that.Rojas: Some people predict AI will exceed human capacity within 20 years. Do you think we are within that time frame, and should we worry about that?Fink: It is a complex question. Let me try to break it down to some extent. There are systems which are faster than humans. They can go into places we cannot go, radiation environments, space, and so forth. That is all hardware. That can happen and happens already.There are systems that can calculate quicker than humans. That is a given too.We have systems that play chess better than humans, and that is only a number crunching exercise. Not to diminish those systems, but just to bring it down to the basics.So, while that is impressive, it is not a threat to humanity. Where it becomes dicey is when you get a system which can move about and can take action, weaponized or not, and is able to react to its environment based on a non-deterministic algorithm. Meaning, it is not scripted. You cannot predict how the system is going to react. If you have such a system, which I think will be possible that it will happen in our lifetime, then, yes, it is something which is a threat to humanity. Especially, if you can't get control of it.To read this interview in its entirety, visit my blog here."
20,WOMEN,Cosby Accuser Says She Was Coerced Into Sex Acts,Nina Bahadur,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jennifer-kaya-thompson-bill-cosby_n_6808930.html,,2015-03-05,"WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 11: Bill Cosby attends the Thurgood Marshall College Fund 25th Awards Gala on November 11, 2013 in Washington City. (Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Thurgood Marshall College Fund)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb60174210000d601c888f0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A woman formerly known as ""Jena T."" who spoke out about her alleged assault at the hands of Bill Cosby has shed her anonymity.Jennifer K. ""Kaya"" Thompson was one of 13 Jane Doe witnesses prepared to testify against Cosby in a 2005 sexual assault lawsuit. In November 2014, she came forward using the name ""Jena T."" This week, she decided to reveal her full name and story. Read her exclusive interview with People here. Thompson first met Cosby in 1988, when she was a 17-year-old aspiring model who traveled from Maryland to New York City to meet with a casting agency. She told People that she was sent to meet Bill Cosby on the set of ""The Cosby Show,"" and that he telephoned her parents to assure them he would look out for her if she moved to the city. Cosby allegedly invited Thompson and her parents to his home for dinner and offered to help her with her career.Thompson soon became uncomfortable with Cosby's constant phone calls, invitations and unwelcome physical touches. In a November 2014 interview with People, she said that in the summer of 1989 she mailed Cosby a poem she'd written about him that read in part: ""Receive a phone call from the Big Man/Who says he has a plan ... He is a thief, a hypocrite and a whore/Who only wants more.""   According to Thompson, she met with Cosby a final time in 1989 to seek ""closure."" He expressed concern about the poem she'd written, and took her to lunch with a psychiatrist friend of his. After lunch, they returned to Cosby's home, where he allegedly pressured Thompson into performing a sex act. ""I'm sure he fixed something to drink,"" she said. ""He knew that I was ready to submit. The whole thing was like –- I just knew that I gave him a hand job.""Thompson told People that she decided to release her full name this week in order to strengthen her story, and stand with more than 30 other women who have accused Cosby of drugging them, assaulting them or coercing them into sex. ""It's come to my understanding that there's greater credibility for my testimony with a full name and an image,"" she said."
21,FIFTY,8 Smart Ideas That Actually Help People Age In Place,Ann Brenoff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/smart-ideas-aging-in-place_n_6737724.html,,2015-03-05,GERMANY - MAY 07: Senior citizens on a park bench. (Photo by Ulrich Baumgarten via Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb670852600002d01830b5b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Baby boomers have long proclaimed their desire to stay in their homes post-retirement, a practice known as aging in place. They want to stay in the communities where they have friends, know their way around and have a support network. Cities and communities have ""heard"" them and many places are preparing for the groundswell of what happens when their residents creep up in years. Building a senior citizen center is nice, but clearly there's more to it than having a place to play Bingo. Here are a few of the programs and trends that are making a difference in the lives of the nation's aging population.1. Solve the ""driving is my independence"" problem once and for all. Older drivers have slower reaction times and more vision issues. Per mile traveled, fatal crash rates increase starting at age 75 and increase notably after age 80, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But the ability to drive is synonymous with independence and independent living, so many older people are reluctant to give up their automobiles. Twenty years ago, inspired by a desire to keep unsafe drivers off the road after an 84-year-old motorist struck and seriously injured her toddler son, Katherine Freund started the Independent Transportation Network. ITN was launched in Portland Maine and has now spread to 25 cities. People who are 65 or older (or visually impaired), pay a modest fee and are provided a ride to where they need to go, a door-to-door escort and assistance. Forty-six percent of ITN customers have an annual income of less than $25,000 and only 2 percent found the service too expensive. Best of all, seniors can trade in their cars and earn ride credits. Rides are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for any purpose.2. Acknowledge the need to sit down. Age-Friendly NYC wants to encourage older adults to get out to walk, shop and socialize. So the goal of this program is to install 1,500 park benches throughout the city for people to sit on. Before you scoff, remember that New York is the city that doesn't sleep. It also doesn't stop and rest much. There are 1 million people over 65 living in NYC, and by 2030 this number is expected to increase by 50 percent, according to the program's website. Age-Friendly NYC also connects older New Yorkers to opportunities at NYC-area colleges and universities.3. Make it easy to keep the brain active. The Bernard Osher Foundation has established Lifelong Learning Institutes for adults 50 and older on 119 college and university campuses. Many community campuses allow those 65 or older to audit free uncredited courses. Publications are printing more large print books too. Large-print crossword puzzles and word-solving games are also available. 4. Understand that eating healthy food keeps people healthier. While everyone knows about Meals On Wheels, which delivers already prepared meals to shut-ins, not everybody wants to stop cooking for themselves. Buying groceries though can involve the need to drive and/or carry heavy bags home. In 2014, the Food For Free programs in Cambridge Massachusetts distributed 1.5 million pounds of food. It began its home delivery program in 2001, serving 12 clients that first year. Now it's up to about 100 housebound elders. It gives seniors and people with disabilities more control over their meals, while providing a supportive service that helps them to stay in their own homes, says the group's website. Two 40- to 45-pound food deliveries are made each month to clients and half the food delivered is fresh produce.And there's Mom's Meals, which for less than $7 a meal will deliver freshly made meals that just need to be heated up and can keep up to 14 days. Mom's Meals ships by FedEx and offer menus for diabetics and heart patients, vegans and those who are gluten-free.5. Doctors who make house calls. While doctors making house calls used to be a common practice a few decades ago, it's practically unheard of now. But it's enjoying a second life in North Carolina. Doctors Making Housecalls is a medical group of 52 clinicians who make more than 75,000 home visits a year in private residences, retirement communities, apartments and assisted living facilities in North Carolina. This is an idea that's bound to spread, along with some routine medical procedures being handled online.6. Encourage the building of more lifelong housing. Rogue Valley, Oregon, has a “lifelong housing” certification program whereby home builders and sellers can have their homes certified as such. The checklist of desirable housing features includes a no-step entry, a first floor full bath, etc. The certification levels are noted in MLS listings so homebuyers seeking age-friendly/multi-generational housing can more easily find appropriate housing and housing creators will hopefully be more encouraged to create age-friendly housing, says AARP. 7. Build a park and they will come. A vacant field in Wichita, Kansas, was turned into a grandparents park -- an outdoor space that children and grandparent (caregivers) could enjoy together. http://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/grandparents-park-wichita-kansas.html  8. Help keep people active. Brownsville, Texas, has a very poor, overweight population with high diabetes rates. One in four residents is age 50 or older. The city hosts several “CycloBias” a year in which streets are closed off to cars so that people can walk, bicycle and participate in health-targeted activities.

22,SPORTS,Anthony Davis 'Guarantees' Kentucky's National Title,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-davis-pelicans_n_6730636.html,,2015-03-05,"New Orleans Pelicans forward Anthony Davis (23) drives against Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love (0) during the first half of an NBA basketball game in New Orleans, Friday, Dec. 12, 2014. Davis left the game in the first quarter with an injury to the chest. (AP Photo/Jonathan Bachman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb778d1200000c5010166ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When New Orleans drafted Kentucky's Anthony Davis first overall in 2012, they did so in the hopes that he would become the NBA's next dominant big man. But even the Pelicans' front office probably didn't think it would happen so quickly. Now in his third season, Davis -- 21 years old, 6 feet 10 inches -- has become a superstar on and off the floor, signing sponsorship deals with American Express and Nike while also averaging 24 points, over 10 rebounds and a league-best 2.67 blocks per game. In fact, on Tuesday, he became just the third player ever to score 35 points and collect 10 rebounds, 8 blocks and 3 steals in a single game. Davis, who won a national title during his only collegiate season at Kentucky, also won gold medals with Team USA in the Olympics and FIBA games.Shortly before last month's All-Star Game in New York City, the Chicago native spent some time with The Huffington Post to discuss his meteoric rise, why he likes seeing double-teams in the post, his trademark unibrow, Kevin Hart and why he's guaranteeing another Kentucky national championship.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.You have become an elite NBA player in a very short period of time. What was the progression for you, last summer to this season?My mid-range jumper. I think that was my biggest focus last summer -- being able to knock that shot down consistently from anywhere on the floor. I read somewhere that you take 1,000 jumpers a day. Is that right?Yeah. Wow, that’s fantastic. How long does that take?Well, it depends on if you’re making them or you’re missing them. It can go for an hour, 30 minutes, hour and a half. I probably have something new to work on every night.Have you seen teams guarding you differently this season, respecting your perimeter shooting more?Yeah, I’m starting to see more double-teams. I’m showing up on the scouting report and they’re trying to make sure they know where I am at all times. It’s a lot different from my first few years, and it’s actually pretty cool seeing other teams getting ready for Anthony Davis and the Pelicans. I think that’s pretty cool.It's a compliment when teams are game planning for you. It’s exciting. Their coach is always telling me, like, 'Man, I’m glad he wasn’t playing tonight.' It’s crazy to hear. I never thought that would be me.Consistency is a constant challenge for young teams. When you look at a franchise like the Spurs, how do you try to mold yourselves in the same way?No matter if they’re up 20 or down 20, they’re going to stick to their game plan. They’re always going to stay the course, stay up and do their own thing. They’re going to stick with their game plan. So that’s what we try to do -- even if we’re down or we’re up, we try to stick with the game plan that Coach has told us and try to go from there, and whatever happens, happens. LaMarcus Aldridge [of the Portland Trail Blazers] seems to be the gold standard for offensive power forwards.He can do so much. He’s extended his 3-point range now, he has a turnaround, post, everything. He’s a tough cover. And then you know, to top it off, he’s 6-foot-11. So he’s a tough guy to cover. He’s got a lot of skill sets with a lot of moves. But I love playing against him. He’s definitely a guy that I get up for and get ready to play against. Who else is really tough for you on a nightly basis? The West has an array of quality bigs.Blake [Griffin, L.A. Clippers], Dirk [Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks]. Blake can get off the rim and get down the floor. He’s strong, and he tries to bulldog you.Where does DeMarcus Cousins [of the Sacramento Kings] fit into that conversation?Yeah, DeMarcus. He can do it all. Best center in the league to me. You’ve got Dwight Howard [Houston Rockets], you’ve got Marc Gasol [Memphis Grizzlies], Zach Randolph [Grizzlies] -- all the bigs in the West are tough.How much do you look into analytics -- your different percentages on the floor -- in terms of what’s the best shot for you to take?I don't look into it, but for me, somebody told me it’s the top of the key.Did you see the comments from Charles Barkley? Really funny stuff. Were you surprised? I didn’t see, what’d he say?He said “I hate sabermetrics, I hate analytics.”I don’t really get into all that. For me it’s more about scouting reports and tendencies. I don’t really care if guys shoot 100 percent from this spot and 75 percent from this spot. At the end of the day you’ve got to defend, and just knowing what moves he likes to use and what he likes to do, I think that helps you a lot. With that in mind, how much are you able to watch the rest of the league? Are you a basketball aficionado where you will actually go home and watch other guys hoop? Oh yeah. I try to watch teams that I know we’re playing coming up, and try to see what they do, what plays they like to run.The league has an abundance of great point guards right now. Specifically, Steph Curry [of the Golden State Warriors] is having an unbelievable season. When you’re guarding the pick-and-roll with a guy like Steph Curry, do you have a certain philosophy where you’re trying to force him away from the hoop?I mean, first off, his range is unlimited, so you can’t just back up and let him get a shot off. You have to try to get the ball out of his hands, honestly -- try to get him to make another pass. And against Golden State, that’s tough, because they can all do the same thing. But you just have to try to get the ball out of his hands and make somebody else beat you. Is it also a physicality thing? Do you try to hit him a little or knock him off of his spot? No, he can do a good job of creating fouls, so you don’t want to [create] a foul call. You just want to try to get the ball out of his hand and make another guy shoot the ball. Are you surprised when you’re walking around and everyone seems to know you now?Oh yeah. A couple years ago it wasn’t like that. So now to get that attention, it’s humbling. I see people walking around with posters and jerseys on and everything like that, so it’s just crazy how I’ve gotten noticed and how far I’ve come in a matter of two years.Who was the biggest celebrity that you were most excited to meet during All-Star Weekend?Kevin Hart.I knew you were going to say that. Yeah, he’s a funny guy.What is it about him exactly that's so appealing?I think he just doesn’t care. Whatever he wants to say, he’ll say. I don’t think he really has a filter, and everything is funny. So that’s why everybody loves him.What would you say to Jameis Winston as he’s going into the NFL? What would be your advice to him, to be a super-high pick -- maybe No. 1 like you -- as he gets ready for the next step?You just gotta stay locked in, stay focused. The league can get the best of you, and you just have to come in with the mindset that you’re going to come in, work hard and compete at every workout, every practice. Make sure you’re at the top of your game when your number’s called or when teams are coming to look at you. Then you can be ready.The ""unibrow"" has become not only a trademark for you, but a phenomenon as well. How much fun have you had with it, given the response it generates from fans?It’s tons of fun. Fans love it, I love it, family loves it. I did some marketing stuff for it. So it’s getting a lot of notoriety and it’s very marketable.What have you seen from the Kentucky team this year? I know you've been asked what would happen if your national title squad played them.They’ve yet to prove their greatness, but they’re a good team. They compete, they play hard, they care about one another. And more importantly, they defend. They’re huge, they’ve got a lot of great bigs and guards who can defend the ball.Is there a similarity that you’ve seen between yourself and [Kentucky Wildcats center] Karl-Anthony Towns?He plays hard. He’s got a good skill set for a big. So I mean, we both have good skill sets, great hands for big guys.Is Kentucky winning it all this year? Guaranteed. Quote me on that one.Are they going to run the table?Man, that’s tough. I mean, I thought we could pull it off, but the Christian Watford shot [against Indiana] -- you can’t control that. It’d be crazy if they do. But I definitely guarantee they’re winning it all. When Indiana beat you that year, did that help you guys in a way?I think it kind of hurt us. I think the Vanderbilt game [a loss in the 2012 SEC Tournament] really helped us going into the tournament. We lost in the SEC Championship and that got our minds back and locked in for the tournament. I don’t think it’s so much the Indiana game, but the Vanderbilt game in the SEC Tournament was a big factor in us winning it all.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report.
