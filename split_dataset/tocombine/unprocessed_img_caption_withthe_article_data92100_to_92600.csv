3,BLACK VOICES,Retired Police Officers Applaud Arrest in SC Shooting of Unarmed Black Man,"Cheryl Dorsey, ContributorSpeaker, Police Expert & Community Advocate",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/retired-police-officers-a_b_7026726.html,"Now that South Carolina has taken this very important first step in arresting and charging Slager with murder, the NCLEO4J along with the Scott family and an outraged community demand justice and accountability.",2015-04-10,2015-04-08-1428510817-2067596-ksatdotcomSCshooting.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-08-1428510817-2067596-ksatdotcomSCshooting-thumb.jpg," photo courtesy ksat.com NCLEO4J demands justice in shooting by white cop of black unarmed SC man.North Charleston, South Carolina authorities were swift and decisive in their response to the video depicting a white police officer, on duty, shooting an unarmed black man as he ran away. Now we want justice!!!The National Coalition of Law Enforcement Officers for Justice Reform & Accountability (NCLEO4J) consists of a diverse ethnic group of veteran, retired police officers from across the nation. The NCLEO4J applauds South Carolina authorities' quick response in the arrest of Police Officer Michael Thomas Slager who was charged in the death of, unarmed, Walter Lamer Scott, 50. The mayor and police chief received a cellphone video that appeared to show Scott fleeing as Slager fired approximately eight shots in his direction; charges were filed less than an hour later.Now that South Carolina has taken this very important first step in arresting and charging Slager with murder, the NCLEO4J along with the Scott family and an outraged community demand justice and accountability. NCLEO4J is looking forward to an equally swift and aggressive prosecution in this case.It would appear that failure, by some police agencies, to aggressively pursue prosecution of egregious acts perpetrated by police officers has created a ""teflon cop"" type of atmosphere. Some police officers have been shown to act with impunity when it comes to the killing of black and brown men and exacerbated by the officers subsequent willingness to manufacture (false) probable cause to justify that thing that we all know is unjustifiable.When police chiefs and police commissioners coddle dishonest police officers and circle the wagons to protect their police department rather than the community to which they promised to protect (& serve) we are left to scratch our collective heads in disbelief.What is it going to take to stop this madness? When are police officers who abuse their authority going to be held accountable? Are we as a society finally ready to require our police officers to articulate that ""fear for safety"" in a real and undeniable way before we just ""take their word?""But for that cellphone video, Officer Slager's version of the deadly shooting would stand alone. We have seen too many times where eyewitness testimony is discounted, if you come from the wrong side of the tracks; victims of deadly force are vilified and the exaggerating, fabricating police officer lives to offend again as in the deaths of Mike Brown, Eric Garner,  Tamir Rice, John Crawford III and Ezell Ford. This latest incident in South Carolina is not the first time that the South Carolina authorities have demonstrated a willingness and desire to seek justice. Remember in September 2014, when Levar Edward Jones had been stopped by a South Carolina state trooper, Sean M. Groubert, in Columbia and asked to show his driver's license? As Jones reached inside his SUV to retrieve the license the SC trooper shot at him four times. Thankfully, Jones survived. Groubert was fired within two weeks and charged with felony assault and battery ""of a high and aggravated nature.""The National Coalition of Law Enforcement Officers for Justice, Reform & Accountability will be watching as we continue to advocate on behalf of and with the families of victims of police brutality and deadly force. It is the intention of the NCLEO4J to stand in support of victim families, movements and legislators like Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, co-sponsor of the"" Build Trust Act."" NCLEO4J stands with a group of USC students who are involved in legislative research and advocacy entitled, ""End Racial Profiling Act 2015.""We endeavor to end the institutional racism that shapes every part of the United States criminal justice system, and work to end police culture that shields abusive and criminal officers from accountability while attacking those who point out their crimes and abuses -- this is the NCLEO4J mission."

The changes drew criticism at home and abroad, including from the United Nations.Under the new law, the government can block electronic media that is deemed to be seditious, extending its reach into Malaysia's largely uncontrolled online media landscape.Last month, authorities arrested editors from an online news portal for sedition, sparking outcry over the wide usage of the law.Harsher penalties for those convicted under the amended law include the removal of a fine of up to 5,000 ringgit ($1,371) and a possible jail term of three years, to be replaced by a mandatory jail term of between three and seven years, said deputy home affairs minister Wan Junaidi Tuaku Jaafar.Despite the harsher punishment, criticism of the government or the judiciary will no longer be regarded as seditious, Wan Junaidi said.Courts will also determine whether a person charged under the act can be released on bail, although suspects can be prevented from leaving the country.Earlier this week, Malaysia passed an anti-terrorism bill allowing for the reintroduction of detention without trial, which had been removed under Prime Minister Najib Razak's ambitious reform agenda in 2012.The Sedition Act was one of a series of laws that were meant to be repealed. However, Najib held back after disastrous election results in 2013 and the law has since been used against opposition politicians, journalists, academics and activists.""You have to bear in mind that circumstances change. From time to time, we need to re-evaluate things,"" Najib said late on Thursday.The government move to toughen the Sedition Act further was criticized by opposition politicians and rights groups, including the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights""It is very disappointing that the Malaysian Government is now proposing to make a bad law worse,"" Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein in a statement before the parliament vote.($1 = 3.6470 ringgit) (Reporting By Trinna Leong; Additional Reporting By Al-Zaquan Amer Hamzah; Editing by Paul Tait)"

AFP PHOTO/NICHOLAS KAMM (Photo credit should read NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f1f5240000500098fdfd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some Libertarians who supported then U.S. Representative Ron Paul (R-TX) in his two failed quests for the Republican presidential nomination are irritated with his son, Rand Paul. Rand Paul, who recently entered the sweepstakes for the GOP presidential nomination, has moderated his positions on some key issues. For example, Rand asserted in 2007 that Iran's alleged pursuit of a nuclear weapon ""is not a threat."" Yet in the U.S. Senate, he supported a resolution that called Iran's nuclear ambitions: ""a tremendous threat."" In another instance, Rand indicated his support for eliminating foreign aid to Israel. However, now he maintains: ""I haven't proposed targeting or eliminating any aid to Israel."" Then in 2011, Rand called for a 23 percent reduction in U.S military spending. Now he calls for a $190 billion increase in military spending.Rand Paul is doing what any savvy political operative would advise him to do: alter and mainstream his message to appeal to as many voters in the Republican Primary as possible. Unlike Rand Paul, the elder Paul stuck vociferously to his ideological convictions. In his 2012 presidential campaign, the elder Paul surged, with strong showings in New Hampshire and Iowa. Then he hit a ceiling. Rather than adapt by amending his positions, Paul did not alter his non-interventionist foreign policy views and stood by his belief that the 9/11 hijackings were effectuated by blowback from the nation's interventionist foreign policy. Paul lost the GOP nomination. While Paul cultivated support from Independents, Libertarian-minded Republicans, and some Democrats who voted in Republican primaries, a Washington Post-ABC poll taken in 2011 showed that only 8 percent of self-identified ""Conservative Republicans"" viewed him as ""strongly favorable.""The younger Paul knows that in the political big leagues, candidates of conviction who refuse to moderate their message or refuse to adapt to the prevailing contemporaneous political sentiment, are often abandoned at the alter by the electoral consumer. Be that as it may, candidates who change their beliefs are often labeled as ""flip floppers."" Yet the excoriation a candidate receives for altering a position is not as damaging as the opprobrium a candidate accrues from taking an unpopular position.The three most recent presidents have shown a willingness to change positions in what many would view as rank electoral opportunism. In 1996, while running for an open State Senate seat in Illinois in a liberal area of Chicago, Barack Obama wrote: ""I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages."" Then in 2008, as a presidential candidate appealing to a more ideological heterogeneous constituency, Obama exclaimed: ""I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage."" In 2012, with polls showing a wider acceptance of gay marriage, and with Vice President Joe Biden announcing his support for gay marriage, Obama, asserted: ""I think same-sex couples should be able to get married."" Many U.S. Senate Democrats also disavowed their past opposition to gay marriage with alacrity.Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, had a similar electoral conversion. As a presidential candidate in 2000, Bush was a steadfast exponent of free trade. He pledged as president to: ""end tariffs and break down barriers everywhere, entirely, so the whole world trades in freedom."" Yet in 2003, just one year before his re-election, Bush uncharacteristically levied tariffs on imported steel, a move that was popular with the domestic steel industry in the electorally critical showdown states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. By contrast, two years later, Bush shepherded through the U.S. Congress the Dominican-Republican-Central American Free Trade Agreement, ignoring protests from Louisiana's Republican Governor Mike Foster that the treaty would ""gradually wipe out the Louisiana sugar industry."" Of course, Louisiana is a ""safe Republican state."" Like Obama and Rand Paul, Bush was willing to alter his ideals for electoral advantage.In 1992, as Democratic presidential candidate Paul Tsongas picked up electoral support -- winning the primary in fiscally austere New Hampshire -- he refused to alter his fiscal austerity mantra. While his ""root canal"" economic policy of raising taxes, truncating federal spending, and controlling entitlement expenditures had played well in the Granite state, it was less popular in other parts of the nation. Tsongas held himself out as a man of convictions and would not support a 10 percent middle-class tax cut favored by one of his opponents, Bill Clinton. Tsongas averred: ""I'm no Santa Clause."" He also called Clinton a ""pander bear"" who ""will say anything, do anything to get votes."" Tsongas called Clinton a ""cynical and unprincipled politician."" Voters might have admired Tsongas's convictions, but it was Clinton's more populist message that struck a resonate chord with Democratic primary voters as Clinton secured the nomination.Two recent presidential nominees, Democrat Al Gore and Republican Mitt Romney, had an ideological makeover, yet charges that they were unprincipled or flip-floppers did not stop voters from awarding them the presidential nomination. Gore began his political career in 1976 by winning an open House Seat in culturally conservator middle Tennessee. He represented his constituents' views, supporting the Hyde Amendment, which disallows federal funding for abortion and ""shall include unborn children from the moment of conception."" Gore branded homosexuality ""abnormal sexual behavior"" and said it ""is not an acceptable alternative that society should affirm."" In 1988, Gore ran as the most conservative presidential candidate, showcasing his support for tobacco farming, telling a North Carolina audience: ""'I've chopped it. I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped it and sold it."" In addition, in 2000, Gore ran for the presidential nomination as a supporter of abortion rights and gay rights, and was a supporter of regulations on the tobacco industry. Voters did not punish him for altering his views. He won the nomination.In 1994, Romney challenged U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy in liberal Massachusetts. Romney supported abortion rights, favored federal campaign-spending limits, and said he would vote for the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. In 2002, while running for Governor of Massachusetts, Romney said: ""I'm someone who's moderate. My views are progressive.""By the time he was running for the 2012 presidential nomination, Romney had disavowed each of these positions and now called himself: ""severely conservative."" Yet, like with Gore, voters granted Romney the nomination.Rand Paul is one of a long line of presidential candidates who is willing to alter or change positions as the situation warrants. Like Tsongas, Ron Paul ran a campaign of stout consistency. He stuck to his ideals even when unpopular. Rand Paul is more in the mold of the other aforementioned politicians. He wants to break through his father's ceiling to garner the Republican presidential nomination and the Presidency. While a candidate who changes positions on issues is often steered off message to explain his/her altered positions, as a cold hard strategic political calculation, the scorn the candidate will take for modifying his/her positions may be worth the price. This is a simple cost-benefit analysis. Perhaps Rand Paul has learned the lesson not only of his father and Paul Tsongas, but also of U.S. Senator Ernest ""Fritz"" Hollings (R-SC), who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 by pledging to reinstate the military draft and to freeze federal spending. Hollings never wavered from these unpopular views. The result: Hollings garnered just 3.5 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire presidential primary. Upon dropping out of the race, Hollings declared: ""Well, nothing happened to me on the way to the White House."""

Copyright © 2014 by Hillary Rodham Clinton. Reprinted by permission of Simon & Schuster, Inc. _______""Where did Hillary go?"" the President asked, looking around. He was in the middle of a short speech about democracy in Burma, standing on the porch of Aung San Suu Kyi's house in Rangoon. ""Where is she?""It was November 2012, and we were on our final trip together as President and Secretary of State. I waved from off to the side and caught his eye. ""There she is,"" he said. As he thanked me, I thought about how far we had come from that day more than four years earlier in Dianne Feinstein's living room. Like our entire last trip together, it was a moment of bittersweet nostalgia, of satisfaction in what we had accomplished, delight in the partners we had become, and sadness that it would soon be over.Just two weeks earlier the President had won reelection. Unlike in 2008, this time I hadn't been able to campaign for him. By law and tradition, Secretaries of State stay out of domestic politics. The Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, was the first I had missed since 1976. In 2008, the convention in Denver had offered me a chance to endorse President Obama and help unify Democrats after the long primary campaign. But during the 2012 convention I was half a world away, representing our country on a diplomatic mission to Asia.On the night my husband addressed the convention and formally nominated the President, I was across the Pacific in tiny Timor-Leste. After a day of diplomacy, I stole away for a few private moments in the residence of our Ambassador. There was no CNN and only limited internet bandwidth, but Philippe Reines had managed to connect to his TiVo back in Washington, so we could watch a delayed recording of Bill's just-completed speech on the Ambassador's home computer. I sat down to watch while the rest of my team crowded behind me.I had to smile when I saw him take the stage in front of the enthusiastic crowd. It had been sixteen years since Bill's last campaign, but he still loved the excitement of a great political moment. Like a country lawyer laying out the facts for a jury, he explained how deeply damaged our economy and global standing had been in 2009 and how the Obama Administration had begun turning things around. At the end of his speech he addressed the question of American decline and renewal. ""For more than two hundred years, through every crisis, we've always come back,"" he said. ""People have predicted our demise ever since George Washington was criticized for being a mediocre surveyor with a bad set of wooden false teeth. And so far, every single person that's bet against America has lost money because we always come back. We come through every fire a little stronger and a little better."" After Bill finished, President Obama unexpectedly appeared onstage to thank him. As the two Presidents embraced, the crowd went wild. Watching from some ten thousand miles away, I was full of pride for the former President I married, the current President I served, and the country we all loved.  A few months later we said our good-byes. I had lunch with President Obama in his private dining room off the Oval Office. Over fish tacos we discussed a twenty-page memo I had prepared with recommendations for his second term, both building on what we had started and new initiatives. On the way out we paused in the Oval Office. Tearing up, I hugged the President and told him again how much our work and friendship meant to me. And that I'd be on call if he ever needed me.On February 1, 2013, my final day in Foggy Bottom, I sat down at the desk in the small cherry-paneled inner office for the last time and wrote John Kerry a letter. I left it in the same place I had found Condi's note to me four years before that. Then I signed my letter of resignation to the President. For the first time in twenty years, after serving as First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State, I no longer had any role in government.My final act was to go down to the lobby--where I had been greeted on my first day back in 2009 -- to say good-bye to the men and women of the State Department and USAID. Thanking them seemed inadequate for all their dedicated service, but I did my best. Once again I saw the marble walls with the etched names of the colleagues we had lost, those who had fallen serving our country. I said a quiet prayer for them and their families. Filling the large lobby were so many people I had come to love and respect. I was glad they would continue serving the United States with intelligence, persistence, and courage. I knew I would always be grateful to have had the chance to lead such a team and to represent America around the world. I had learned anew the goodness of our people and the greatness of our nation, and I would face the future with a full and open heart. ***I wrote this book over the course of 2013 and early 2014, mostly from a cozy, sun-drenched third-floor study in our home in Chappaqua, New York. There's a thick carpet and a comfortable chair, and I can look out through the windows into the treetops. I finally had time to read, catch up on sleep, go on long walks with my husband and our dogs, see more of my family, and think about the future.In early 2014, Bill and I got some wonderful news that we'd been eagerly waiting to hear: we were going to be grandparents. We were both beyond happy for Chelsea and Marc and unabashedly giddy at the prospect. It was hard to think of anything else, even with a book to finish. My mind kept returning to this miracle waiting to happen. Chelsea and Marc decided not to find out the sex of the baby or settle on a name in advance, so we were left to imagine just who this newest member of our family would turn out to be. As the summer slipped away, I drove Chelsea crazy checking in practically every hour. How are you feeling? Any news from the doctor? When's it going to happen! Thirty-four years before, when I was pregnant with Chelsea, Bill and I had no idea what to expect, despite the Lamaze classes we took together. I remember how frazzled he was when it was finally time to go to the hospital. Lamaze recommended bringing a small plastic bag of ice to suck on during labor. Bill ended up bringing enough to fill a thirty-nine-gallon garbage bag. It was quite a sight. By comparison, Chelsea and Marc were much more organized and prepared. The way they stayed calm and always supported each other was no surprise to anyone who knew them, but it still made me proud. They were going to be terrific parents. Finally, in September, it was time. As soon as we heard Marc and Chelsea were on the way to the hospital, Bill and I left our home in Chappaqua (without any ice!) and rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. After meeting and thanking the medical team who would take care of Chelsea and the new baby, we settled into waiting. At 7:03 PM on September 26, 2014, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky made her grand entrance. Chelsea emerged, exhausted but glowing. I have to admit, I was glowing quite a bit myself. Bill and I followed the proud parents back into their room. All our pent up nervous energy burst out in laughter and excited whoops, more like a couple of kids than the newly-minted grandparents we had suddenly become. After a while, Bill and I stepped out into the hallway to let them rest. We sat quietly, holding hands, trying to process the rush of emotions. I looked over and saw a tear in Bill's eye. Over the days and weeks that followed, Bill and I spent as much time as we could visiting and helping. I wanted to be as much help to Chelsea and Marc as our own parents had been to us. My mom and dad were always on call to drive from Chicago to Little Rock to babysit whenever we had to travel on official state business or just needed an extra pair of hands. Bill's mother Virginia, who Chelsea called Ginger, was a constant source of wisdom and laughter as we tried to navigate the unfamiliar waters of parenthood. In many ways, taking care of a baby has gotten a lot more complicated since we did it more than three decades ago. But some things never change. As I watch Bill carry Charlotte around our house, stopping at nearly every book on the shelf to explain the plot and how much she will enjoy reading it one day, I can't help but remember how he used to walk Chelsea around the Arkansas Governor's Mansion, singing and rocking until she fell asleep. When Bill and I get down on our hands and knees to play on the floor with Charlotte, I find myself thinking back to how amazed I was when my own father did the same with Chelsea. I had never seen anything like that before! At the time, I couldn't believe how that gruff and imposing man just melted in the palm of his granddaughter. Now I know exactly how he felt. When Chelsea was born, I was full of nerves--despite all the books I had read and my work at Yale's Child Study Center, I was unprepared for the sheer wonder and responsibility of parenthood. I prayed that I would be a good enough mother and I quickly came to feel that having a child is like letting ""your heart go walking around outside your body,"" as the writer Elizabeth Stone put it. It was magical and terrifying all at the same time. As a new grandmother, however, there is nothing but joy. It's probably the world's best job. You get all the happiness of doting on a tiny child as she begins exploring the world, but without the responsibilities or anxieties of being a parent. I love every minute of it. When Chelsea was little, Bill and I read to her nonstop. Pediatricians now advise parents to start engaging verbally from the day babies are born because it does so much to develop their brains and cognition. In our house, Goodnight Moon was a particular favorite. I also tried to sing lullabies and old favorites, despite the fact that carrying a tune has never been one of my strengths. That lasted until Chelsea was about 18 months old, when she reached up one tiny finger during the middle of my rendition of ""Moon River,"" touched my lips and said, ""No sing, Mommy, no sing."" All these years later, I've mostly learned my lesson. But occasionally, I still sneak in a song or two and Charlotte has yet to complain. ***I was delighted to find that Charlotte's birth seemed to strike a chord with a lot of Americans. Chelsea and I received letters and gifts from moms and grandmothers across the country - stuffed animals, tiny sweaters, hand-knitted socks and hats, even some baby-sized sports jerseys from various teams. One gift we treasured was ""Charlotte's Web,"" the classic children's book by E.B. White. As I've recently rediscovered, it's a wonderful read. At one point, when the wise family doctor is asked what he makes of the mysterious messages in the spider web, he observes, ""When the words appeared, everyone said they were a miracle. But nobody pointed out that the web itself is a miracle."" That's how I've come to think about Charlotte (our Charlotte, not the spider.) Every day with a new child is a miracle. Her smallest gestures sweep me off my feet. And while I am completely convinced that Charlotte is far and away the most beautiful, smart, and accomplished infant anywhere, I also understand that the true miracle here is universal. That's why so many other grandmothers have reached out to me. They all feel the same way I do. They're just as proud of their little ones and they have just as many dreams for their futures. I have always believed that every child should have the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. That principle has animated my entire career, from my earliest days as a young attorney with the Children's Defense Fund straight through to my service in the Senate and as Secretary of State. Now that I'm a grandmother, I believe it even more passionately. Unfortunately, too few of the children born in the United States and around the world today will grow up with the same opportunities as Charlotte. You shouldn't have to be the granddaughter of a President or a Secretary of State to receive excellent health care, education, enrichment, and all the support and advantages that will one day lead to a good job and a successful life. That's what we want for all our kids. And this isn't just idealism. It's a recipe for broadly-shared prosperity and a healthy democracy. The notion of equal opportunity has been at the heart of the American experiment since the very beginning. It's part of what made the United States exceptional and it attracted generations of immigrants determined to work hard and provide their families with that same chance at success. I'm more convinced than ever that our future in the 21st century depends on our ability to ensure that a child born in the hills of Appalachia or the Mississippi Delta or the Rio Grande Valley grows up with the same shot at success that Charlotte will.Becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on. Rather than make me want to slow down, it has spurred me to speed up. As Margaret Mead said, children keep our imaginations fresh and our hearts young, and they drive us to work for a better future. I've also returned again and again to this question of universality - how much we all have in common even if the circumstances of our lives may be different. As you've seen throughout this book, one of the defining themes of my time as Secretary of State was our increasing global interdependence. Despite all the division and discord in the world, which sometimes can seem overwhelming, the basic fact of the 21st century is that we're more connected than ever. If the United States continues to lead the world in the years ahead, as I believe it can and must, it will be because we have learned how to define the terms of our interdependence to promote more cooperation and shared prosperity and less conflict and inequality. As we've seen since the first edition of this book was published in June 2014, the negative side of interdependence remains potent -- whether it was the spread of virulent new strands of extremism in the Middle East or old-style nationalism in Europe or a deadly epidemic in Africa. Our job is to build up the positive side. The United States and the other great democracies have to redouble our efforts to empower moderates and marginalize extremists everywhere, and to stand firmly and united in pursuit of a more just, free, and peaceful world. That's the world I want for Charlotte and for all our kids.Among all the gifts and cards that arrived not long after Charlotte did was a package from a woman who had watched her 83-year old mother stitch together beautiful quilts for many years and wanted to give it a shot. ""This is my first and only attempt to sew a memory quilt for anyone,"" she explained. Inside I found a red, white, and black patchwork that included panels with inspiring inscriptions and famous photos of Chelsea through the years. I held it up to the light and had to smile at the familiar images. A ""memory quilt"" was a good name for it. It was hard to believe that the baby girl I was holding in one photo could be the same poised and lovely woman being married in another. Yet there she was. I wondered for a moment what a quilt of my own life would look like. There were so many people who had taught me so much. And now I had one more. In just a few months, Charlotte had already helped me see the world in new ways. There was so much more to do. So many more panels waiting to be filled in. I folded up the quilt and got back to work."

Photo: Johan Persson  There's a rip-roaring, malevolently Machiavellian, viciously nasty, blood-letting saga of intrigue and incest on view just now. No, not in the cloistered cloakrooms of the U.S. House of Representatives; no incest there, presumably. The cornucopian epic in question can be found at Broadway's Winter Garden, where the Royal Shakespeare Company's impressively adventurous production of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall has set up shop for fifteen weeks.Wolf Hall is the five hour, two-session historical drama of deceit and betrayal in the court of King Henry VIII based on Dame Hilary Mantel's Booker Prize-winning novels, ""Wolf Hall"" and ""Bring Up the Bodies."" The two plays, adapted by Mike Poulton, were major 2014 hits for the RSC. The theatrical tour de force has now been transported to New York, complete with a cast of twenty-three members of British Equity. Presented in Stratford and London under the titles of Mantel's two best-selling fictional novels, they are here more simply called Wolf Hall: Parts 1 & 2.Ms. Mantel's conceit is to chronicle the rise of Thomas Cromwell (Ben Miles), a lowly blacksmith's-son-turned-lawyer who becomes the all-powerful ""fixer"" for King Henry VIII (Nathaniel Parker). Henry has a problem, as the play begins: his long-time wife Katherine of Aragon (Lucy Briers) has been unable to bear a son. What to do? His solution is to get rid of Katherine so he can marry the presumably more fertile Anne Boleyn (Lydia Leonard). How to accomplish this, given the opposition of the Catholic Church--and the all-powerful Pope--to divorce? When his royal ministers cannot devise a course of action, Henry enlists the lower-class Cromwell. He manages to pull it off, knocking off the principled Sir Thomas More (John Ramm) in the process and becoming Henry's Master Secretary.    Nathaniel Parker as Henry VIII in the  Royal Shakespeare Company production of Wolf Hall. Photo: Johan Persson  This is familiar ground; at least it is for British audiences. U.S. patrons with intensive PBS training will be right at home in Henry's court, although it was apparent at a packed and enthusiastic press preview that the story is not quite so familiar here. (The sudden identification of one of the ladies-in-waiting near the end of the first act--""Oh, I'm nobody, I'm only Jane Seymour""--is clearly intended to have maximum effect, but the moment doesn't land quite so well if only a sliver of the audience realize that she is to be the next Mrs. Henry.) As for More, that ""Man for All Seasons"" as Robert Bolt so memorably sketched him, he is here drawn as something of a weasely martinet who is not mourned when Henry has them chop off his head. I suppose that in life, More was more admirable and Cromwell more slimy than suggested in Wolf Hall. No matter, as More eventually won sainthood and an Oscar. Poulton is a prolific dramatist specializing in adaptations; he has previously been represented here by the Alan Bates vehicle Fortune's Fool. He has skillfully whittled down Mantel's two-volume, 1,100-page work so that it veritably breezes by in the theatre. Full credit also goes to his all-important collaborator on the project, director Jeremy Herrin. When your audience streams eagerly back to their seats for the second act of the first play, knowing that they have another hour plus another full-length evening to come--you know you have them well and truly hooked. Christopher Oram, of Red and Frost/Nixon, provides a massive but simplistic set for all seasons, which allows the director to keep things flowing. The company also make effective use of the auditorium, with the stage area spilling over onto the orchestra floor. Costumes (by Oram), lights and sound add to the panoply.Central to the proceedings is Mr. Miles (previously seen here as Tom, the complaisant veterinarian, in the 2009 import of Alan Ayckbourn's three-part Norman Conquests). Cromwell is ever-present in this sixteenth century tale, and he--rather than the legendarily larger-than-life Henry--remains our focus throughout. Miles carries it off with the presence of--well, Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons. He is ably supported by Mr. Parker, who brings us a human Henry who struggles to believe in the right of what he is doing. Ms. Leonard, too, makes a strong showing as a Machiavellian Anne Boleyn. The personae is filled with interesting characterizations from the company, most of whom play multiple roles.    Ben Miles and Lydia Leonard in the  Royal Shakespeare Company production of Wolf Hall. Photo: Johan Persson  Through what was likely an unforeseen consequence, the RSC's two-part adaptation of Mantel's novels arrived on our shores the very same time that the BBC's six-part television adaptation began airing on PBS. The TV version is built around the Cromwell of Mark Rylance. Not wanting to cloud my reaction to the plays, I have refrained from watching the series; one imagines that Rylance, being Rylance, is commanding. But that is suitable for watching in your living room or on your tablet. The RSC Wolf Hall offers an evening--or, rather, two evenings--of live, inventively rousing theatricality. .

At the time, I was the manager of training and organizational development for the newspaper. Laventhol was new to the Times but not new to Times Mirror. He and I were having lunch to talk about the culture and future of the company. In our conversation, I used the biblical story of Exodus to describe how organizations change. ""And you are Moses,"" I told Laventhol. He looked surprised and laughed -- but I wasn't joking. Everyone knew that the LA Times needed to change if it was going to meet the challenges of the future, and we wanted Laventhol to be our change agent.Moses had an important job to do -- liberating his people from Egypt and leading them to the Promised Land. It sounds simple but it wasn't easy. For, as you'll recall, the Israelites didn't go straight from Egypt to the Promised Land -- they wandered in the desert for 40 years before arriving at their destination. And what Moses didn't discover until well into his journey was that he actually had TWO jobs: to get the people out of Egypt... and to get Egypt out of the people (which was actually the harder of the two jobs). His people's traditional habits, old ways of thinking, assumptions, values, and culture all had to be transformed before they could establish a new culture in The Promised Land. An old generation literally had to die off in the desert while a new generation was born. The newspaper business was just entering the wilderness when Laventhol took over as LA Times publisher. It is still in the wilderness today. Newspaper people are going through the predictable stages of organizational change while experiencing the normal feelings that accompany such change. There are five stages to the process: (1) denial, (2) upset, anger, betrayal, frustration, attempts to hold on to old, familiar ways, (3) acceptance, hitting bottom, giving up the old, (4) exploration and experimentation, tentatively moving forward into the unknown, and finally, (5) new commitment, fully embracing a new reality, participating with creativity, vigor, and enthusiasm. Newspaper people are behaving much like the Israelites in the desert -- complaining, criticizing their leaders, taking potshots at technology because it's a convenient target, creating false idols, and floundering around in confusion, anger, and resentment at the predicament in which they find themselves, while wishing they could go back to good ole days in Egypt because at least it was predictable, safe, and familiar (even if you did have to worship Pharaoh).The first step in dealing with such enormous changes is to understand the process -- once you know the stages, it's at least a little bit reassuring to know that there is a beginning, middle, and an end. Second, understand that your emotional reactions, and those of your colleagues, are normal. You would be weird if you didn't feel sadness, loss, grief, anger, confusion, and betrayal. Third, extend compassion, patience, and understanding to those who are handling the change badly. Different people have varying capacities for going through the stages of change -- some move through the stages quickly with minimal pain, but many more suffer enormously. Some people get stuck at one stage or another and never make it to the fourth and fifth stages of change. Newspaper leaders, you bear a special responsibility to shepherd your people through the wilderness with skill, courage, vision, and all the leadership energy you can muster. While David Laventhol was the first in a series of Moses change agents who tried over the past three decades to lead the LA Times out of the wilderness, you are the Moses of your own media company today. Your job is to free your people from the old newspaper paradigm and lead them to a Promised Land that no one can describe, much less point out on a map. Gird your loins, for your journey through the wilderness may very well last 40 years or more. Be understanding and compassionate -- your people are in pain and they will criticize you, question you, berate you, and perhaps even revile you. Forgive them. Love them and care for them - they need good care and feeding on their arduous journey. And remember, Moses was a change leader -- he didn't make it to the Promised Land himself. His job was to get his people there. So is yours.

The process of creating life for a mother as she births a child. The transition from girlhood to womanhood, boyhood to manhood. From womanhood to motherhood. And from life to death. Today some of these moments are marked solely commercially (a baby shower), a pricey Bar Mitzvah / Bat Mitzvah (yes, Hebrew is learned but has the child become an adult?) while the more profound are entirely ignored.Last year, my wife and two young sons were living in Tanzania. They were lucky enough to observe young Maasai warriors aged 13-21 return after their circumcision (no painkillers and no show of pain permitted) and their 3-month exile in the bush where they healed and lived off the land. They left as boys. They returned as men. They can't marry until they have gone through this transition. It has very clear rules, actions and words and has stood the test of time. 500+ years of time. That's a ceremony.My wife and I run a diaper company. We speak with new and expectant moms and dads all day long and over the past 10 years have noticed that the transition for moms from womanhood to motherhood is also entirely ignored. The pregnant mom gets all the accolades. The ceremony and words are known by all. ""You are glowing"" then a touch of the belly. That's it.But when the baby actually arrives? Radio silence as the new parents struggle with their entire world being thrown upside down. With no mandated paid parental leave in the U.S. at least, it is right back to work for both parents usually. The data shows that marital unhappiness spikes in the first year of a firstborn's arrival. And little wonder. This woman has created life. Pause here. She has created life. It is the ultimate creative act. And she did it. Yes, with her partners assistance but the birth was 100 percent her. And what happens? She and he are flung into a world of exhaustion, confusion, sleeplessness and breastfeeding failures. Thank goodness that little one is so adorable otherwise we may not survive as a species!

Kaleidoscopic in their intensity, Peters' works are both intuitive excavations and explorations of pattern. I recently spoke to David Allan Peters and asked him about his background, his education and his methods. John Seed Interviews David Allan Peters:David Allan PetersJS: David, from what you tell me you grew up in a family that supported your creativity...DAP: Definitely: as a child I was making things all the time. My parents were very supportive and I was was allowed to try whatever I wanted. JS: When did you decide to be an artist? DAP: I took my first art class in junior college in Cupertino, CA (which at time was a very small agricultural town) and began playing with materials and received encouraging feedback from my teachers. Then I got serious and attended the San Francisco Art Institute from 1995 through 1997. In San Francisco, I was exposed to more art and artists: it was a big step. My parents got me an SFMOMA membership and I would stop in at the museum daily. I was exposed to so much there: I loved their Sigmar Polke, and I remember seeing a Richard Serra splash piece.  Untitled #26, 2014, Acrylic on wood panel, 48 x 36 inchesJS: What kind of work did you do in San Francisco? DAP: At SFAI I was into abstraction and materials. I was trying to make my own kind of marks, but not a brushstroke. Being in the Bay Area I was looking at ""juicy"" paintings -- like Joan Brown and Jay DeFeo's The Rose -- and I kept asking myself: 'How can I use that kind of energy another way?' I did some cut out paintings, and also some that were scratched out and had sand in them. That was the beginning of the layering in my work. I was just making a lot of work, painting all the time, becoming obsessed with the process of making paintings.Liat Yossifor, who is also showing at Amerigner | McEnery | Yohe, was an undergraduate at SFAI with me, and I remember that we were both completely ""geeked out"" on painting. Untitled #1, 2015, Acrylic on wood panel, 18 x 14 inchesJS: And after that you did grad work in Claremont with Karl Benjamin, right? DAP: Actually, when I got to Claremont I hadn't heard of Karl Benjamin. But I started to see him and his dog 'Macho'. We started to talk a lot, and we clicked and became good friends and I started helping him out as a studio assistant. Karl reinforced the intuitiveness in my art work. That was a turning point for me. Although I still wasn't sure what was going on in my work at that time, something was changing and I began to work with color more. Untitled #2, 2015, Acrylic on wood panel, 18 x 14 inchesJS: Have you always been an abstract artist? DAP: Not exactly. As a kid, I copied old master paintings out of my parent's old art books. I tried hard to paint those kinds of paintings, but I couldn't quite do it. I soon figured out that I could make them look good by hiding paint layers by putting stain over them. It made them look much better, and I used sandpaper to bring up the colors. It definitely connects with some of what I am doing now. Edge detail: photo by Lance GerberJS: Tell me a bit about the processes involved in your recent ""carved"" works.DAP: They just go and go: I don't keep track of how many layers I have used...sometimes hundreds. One of my big things is the edge. I am always thinking about lines and stripes in my paintings. And to see all of those, you have to look around the piece.As far as carving goes, its just one little chip at a time... like a mantra... until the painting becomes harmonious. Untitled #4, 2015, Acrylic on wood panel, 18 x 14 inchesJS: Are you pouring paint as you go? Scraping? DAP: I do it with a paintbrush. I start by hiding the strokes from the layer before: I make all these fine layers and then I try to erase them from the surfaces. There are a lot of happy accidents along the way: random things. But then, I regain control by carving the surface. Untitled #6, 2015, Acrylic on wood panel, 18 x 14 inchesJS: Who are some of the other artists that you are looking at? DAP: I live in Little Ethiopia in Los Angeles which is blocks away from LACMA. I take breaks from my work and ride my bike up to LACMA a few times a times a week. I enjoy looking at Gerhard Richter, Robert Ryman and Tomma Abts. I keep to myself so I can stay directed. You have to work hard.JS: What are your interests outside of art?DAP: I ride my bike, garden -- I try do quiet things. And I enjoy NHL hockey.JS: Is there anything else you would like to say about your work?DAP:  I'm a shy person which enables me to stay directed and work hard at making work.

Kaleidoscopic in their intensity, Peters' works are both intuitive excavations and explorations of pattern. I recently spoke to David Allan Peters and asked him about his background, his education and his methods. John Seed Interviews David Allan Peters:David Allan PetersJS: David, from what you tell me you grew up in a family that supported your creativity...DAP: Definitely: as a child I was making things all the time. My parents were very supportive and I was was allowed to try whatever I wanted. JS: When did you decide to be an artist? DAP: I took my first art class in junior college in Cupertino, CA (which at time was a very small agricultural town) and began playing with materials and received encouraging feedback from my teachers. Then I got serious and attended the San Francisco Art Institute from 1995 through 1997. In San Francisco, I was exposed to more art and artists: it was a big step. My parents got me an SFMOMA membership and I would stop in at the museum daily. I was exposed to so much there: I loved their Sigmar Polke, and I remember seeing a Richard Serra splash piece.  Untitled #26, 2014, Acrylic on wood panel, 48 x 36 inchesJS: What kind of work did you do in San Francisco? DAP: At SFAI I was into abstraction and materials. I was trying to make my own kind of marks, but not a brushstroke. Being in the Bay Area I was looking at ""juicy"" paintings -- like Joan Brown and Jay DeFeo's The Rose -- and I kept asking myself: 'How can I use that kind of energy another way?' I did some cut out paintings, and also some that were scratched out and had sand in them. That was the beginning of the layering in my work. I was just making a lot of work, painting all the time, becoming obsessed with the process of making paintings.Liat Yossifor, who is also showing at Amerigner | McEnery | Yohe, was an undergraduate at SFAI with me, and I remember that we were both completely ""geeked out"" on painting. Untitled #1, 2015, Acrylic on wood panel, 18 x 14 inchesJS: And after that you did grad work in Claremont with Karl Benjamin, right? DAP: Actually, when I got to Claremont I hadn't heard of Karl Benjamin. But I started to see him and his dog 'Macho'. We started to talk a lot, and we clicked and became good friends and I started helping him out as a studio assistant. Karl reinforced the intuitiveness in my art work. That was a turning point for me. Although I still wasn't sure what was going on in my work at that time, something was changing and I began to work with color more. Untitled #2, 2015, Acrylic on wood panel, 18 x 14 inchesJS: Have you always been an abstract artist? DAP: Not exactly. As a kid, I copied old master paintings out of my parent's old art books. I tried hard to paint those kinds of paintings, but I couldn't quite do it. I soon figured out that I could make them look good by hiding paint layers by putting stain over them. It made them look much better, and I used sandpaper to bring up the colors. It definitely connects with some of what I am doing now. Edge detail: photo by Lance GerberJS: Tell me a bit about the processes involved in your recent ""carved"" works.DAP: They just go and go: I don't keep track of how many layers I have used...sometimes hundreds. One of my big things is the edge. I am always thinking about lines and stripes in my paintings. And to see all of those, you have to look around the piece.As far as carving goes, its just one little chip at a time... like a mantra... until the painting becomes harmonious. Untitled #4, 2015, Acrylic on wood panel, 18 x 14 inchesJS: Are you pouring paint as you go? Scraping? DAP: I do it with a paintbrush. I start by hiding the strokes from the layer before: I make all these fine layers and then I try to erase them from the surfaces. There are a lot of happy accidents along the way: random things. But then, I regain control by carving the surface. Untitled #6, 2015, Acrylic on wood panel, 18 x 14 inchesJS: Who are some of the other artists that you are looking at? DAP: I live in Little Ethiopia in Los Angeles which is blocks away from LACMA. I take breaks from my work and ride my bike up to LACMA a few times a times a week. I enjoy looking at Gerhard Richter, Robert Ryman and Tomma Abts. I keep to myself so I can stay directed. You have to work hard.JS: What are your interests outside of art?DAP: I ride my bike, garden -- I try do quiet things. And I enjoy NHL hockey.JS: Is there anything else you would like to say about your work?DAP:  I'm a shy person which enables me to stay directed and work hard at making work. I want people to get what they can from them, to take their time and enjoy.David Allan Peters March 19 - April 18 Ameringer | McEnery | Yohe 525 West 22nd Street, NY, NY 10011Works by David Allan Peters can also be viewed at:Royale Projects: Contemporary Art 73190 El Paseo Suite #3  Palm Desert CA 92262 760.742.5182"

Go tell it to the good, decent families, I've met whose paradise has been turned into a living hell. Go and see it, or view non-fiction photography (no fudged facts, no self-censorship), if you are unable to get away. At the end of the day, all that matters to my mind is delivering the truth and not simply blowing smoke. I found some photos online yesterday that had me seeing red. They were snapshots, made in February 2015, of a clan of Batek Negritos hunter/gatherers I had documented in 2010 and 2011 in and around their Malaysian government-funded resettlement camp (out of the rainforest). They showed the aftermath of a massive flood, the kind of flood very rare inside a healthy rainforest, but they no longer live inside a healthy rainforest despite there being a massive one a stone's throw away which also used to be a part of their ancestral homeland. It is Taman Negara National Park in Peninsular Malaysia (pictured below), 434,300 hectares (4,343 sq. km) of protected, 130 million year old primary rainforest that supports tigers, sumatran rhinoceros, Asian elephants, Malaysian gaur (wild bovine), tapir, gibbons, monkeys, over 300 species of birds, over 1,000 species of butterfly and over 14,500 species of flowering plants and trees. The Malaysian government resettled the Batek to the edge of the national park, while forbidding them from hunting or gathering inside the park, part of their ancestral homeland for at least 10,000 years. Logging/oil palm conglomerates arrived nearly 40 years ago and began logging the vast unprotected rainforests (also part of the Batek ancestral homeland) north of the park. Without consultation with or the permission from the Batek (seen above), these corporations began to cut down those unprotected forests, selling the timber to fund conversion of the forest into vast oil palm plantations. By the time I arrived in 2010, the Batek community had been split in two, with half living in the aforementioned government settlement at the northern entrance to the national park and the other half living about 40 minutes walk up a logging road in a settlement on the edge of the forest. Some Batek, at the government settlement, actually owned cars and motorbikes that they bought by working in the cash economy. The others lived traditionally, off the grid. All Batek were forbidden, by law, from entering the oil palm plantations. So the Batek, found themselves, within less than a half century, sandwiched between two restricted areas that used to comprise their core territory for 10 millennia.   (Above) Batek women take a break in forest surveyed (now clear-cut) for logging in preparation to become the new oil palm plantation.If that was not bad enough, I noticed in the background of the snaps that the last tiny, tiny sliver of unprotected forest outside the national park boundary had now also been clear-cut, ignoring the need for a buffer zone between the park and the ocean of existing oil palm plantations, just like this one (below) also on the Batek's ancestral land. There had been so little of the Batek's forest left but now even it was gone, and the now-barren hills had been terraced to prepare for a new oil palm plantation. The river that the Batek had relied upon for fish and protein, which ran clear in 2010/2011, is now completely burdened with silt.   The truth is, similar daylight robbery of indigenous land and human rights is happening all over the planet. The Huaorani, the Shuar, the Sa'amaka & N'dyuka Maroons, and dozens of other Amazon Basin peoples; various so-called pygmy people, such as the Bagyeli of the Congo Rainforest; the Penan, Iban, Kenyah, Kayan, the Kelabit to name a few of the Borneo Dayak peoples; the Agta, the Aeta, the Batek, the Dumagat and other Negrito peoples have all experienced either land grabs, contamination of water, degradation of soil or unsanctioned resource exploitation on their ancestral land; or all of the above. They are just some of a sampling of indigenous peoples that I have personally documented. Indigenous peoples, particularly those living in fragile arctic and tropical eco-systems, are the canaries in the human coal mine, forecasting troubles to come for all of us. So, I've taken this stand.  ******************************************************************************** No, I do not believe that humans will die out entirely from climate change, but many endangered species will. I do believe, however, that many people will needlessly suffer grinding poverty as a result of global warming, and many will also die as a direct result of that poverty. As a child, I lived from the age of 7 until 19 in the New York City area. In 1967, when I moved there from California, waterways near massive oil refineries on the New York - New Jersey border would sometimes actually catch fire when petroleum barges would spill toxic crude oil and it would float on the water's surface. By the late '70's, because of new environmental-protection laws, cattle egrets and other water birds had begun to return. In the suburbs where I lived, just 20 miles (30 km) from Manhattan, first raccoons and opossums began to filter back. By the late '90's, I would go jogging, on family visits back, and see deer in town parks. In fact, a couple of years ago, while staying at a friend's house in Bushwick, Brooklyn, two rowdy raccoons crossed my path near a cemetery during a jog. I have been told that even coyote and deer have been sighted within the New York City limits. Change is possible.If that massive change is possible in New York, reducing greenhouse gases is also possible over time. If wildlife are healthy, the environment is healthy. If the environment is healthy, people can live healthier lives. Simple stuff.For me, making a stand, or raising one's voice is not bad form. It is not a turn off. I believe it is necessary.

These rebellious heroes are fighting for your right to know that eating mostly plants can prevent and even reverse heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and sexual dysfunction. Dr. T. Colin Campbell wrote The China Study and stars in the documentary Forks Over Knives. His son Nelson Campbell led the eating trials in nearby Mebane, North Carolina. Both men worked with Representative Tom Riner of Kentucky, who was not at the screening in Chapel Hill, on legislation to improve health and support family farms in Kentucky. Dr. Campbell outlines the battle field well when he says:Our system is about gaining wealth for the few at the expense of the health of the many.These modern Davids chose hard battles. Getting a few hundred people in a university town to eat healthy vegan food for ten days might not be a big deal, but doing it in ""more mainstream"" Mebane, North Carolina, is a big deal indeed. The documentary notes that Mebane is in the middle of the barbeque belt and the stroke belt. No doubt it was harder to lobby the Kentucky legislature than ones in California or Vermont. Some of the best laugh lines came as politicians tried to satisfy their donors despite scientific evidence. We see an unusual level of diversity in the eating trials. Participants had a broad range of professions and skin tones. One of the best scenes features a sermon on healthy eating given by a black minster. Hallelujah!I hope the final cut mentions the long-term effects of the eating trials. How many participants still eat a whole foods plant-based diet now that they have to cook or buy meals themselves? Does the business that participated now serve veggie lasagne and hummus in its cafeteria? Do the churches that joined in have more three-bean salad than fried chicken at their picnics?   Call to join the movementDuring the Q&A after the film, Nelson Campbell (shown above) encouraged us to join the PlantPure Nation movement. He envisions a grassroots movement, with local ""pods"" of supporters creating local initiatives and sharing their experiences with the network. Larger efforts will be developed by the PlantPure Foundation. For example, the PlantPure Oasis program that will work with church partners to make healthy, affordable meals available in low-income areas.His vision might work. After all, 160 people came to a noon showing on the glorious spring day before Easter. So many people came that the Chelsea Theater showed it on an additional screen. As I squeezed down a packed hallway before the show, I passed a young woman in shorts giving Dr. Campbell (shown above) an earnest two-handed handshake and telling him, ""You changed my life."" I had to nod: he changed mine too, convincing me to drop eggs and dairy from the Cook for Good menus back in 2011.Cooking is keyBut for the PlantPure Nation to work, the movement needs teach people how to cook. Even experienced omnivore cooks need to learn new techniques if they want to cook scrumptious meals based on vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and nuts with little or no added sugar or oil. I meet many people in my cooking classes who don't know how to wash greens or bake a potato.Nearly all of the cooking in the movie was done by chefs preparing large quantities of food for the eating trial. The material is there: the documentary's companion is the PlantPure Nation Cookbook by Nelson's wife Kim Campbell. I checked Yelp after the documentary to see if Mebane has any vegan-friendly restaurants. No, it's still firmly in the barbeque-and-stroke belt. Clearly anyone in Mebane who wants to continue eating the PlantPure way needs to cook for themselves. Home cooking is vital even in vegan paradises like Asheville or Seattle. Cooking costs less and is more sustainable than going out to eat or buying packaged prepared food.At the screening, I sat next to the couple shown above who also think cooking is key. Ryan and Jamie Weeks have eaten a mostly a whole foods plant-based diet for three years, even though they are raise livestock. (They run an independent family farm and, being in their fifties, don't feel they are in a position to change.) Jamie told me they would never go back to eating meat and Ryan agreed. She said: The cleaner you eat, the better you feel.Ryan said Jamie's tasty cooking made it easy for him to adopt a plant-based diet. Jamie said she'd rather eat her own cooking than go out, although they enjoy visiting vegan and ethnic restaurants.

Close to 40 years after releasing her debut album and 35 chart-topping singles later, she is still conquering new heights. Her latest single ""Going Out Like That"" shot to No. 1 on the Country iTunes Charts and scored the biggest single sales debut of her career. She recently celebrated her birthday and has no hesitation in saying, ""I turned 60!"" She credits her youthful look and vivacious spirit to eating right, getting lots of exercise and just trying to stay happy with a great attitude. No doubt becoming a new grandmother last June to Kelly Clarkson's daughter River Rose has kept her on the move, and she's enjoying the perks of being a grandmother.""You get to play with all the kids, and then they get to go home and be disciplined and taken to school and all of the other activities that they do by their parents,"" she said. Much of her happiness spills over in Love Somebody, her first new album in five years."" In addition to ""Going Out Like That,"" the album includes a duet with Jennifer Nettles called ""Enough,"" which McEntire calls a ""stop-you-in-your-tracks song"" that is in the same vein as ""Does He Love You,"" her smash single with Linda Davis. I caught up with the superstar to talk about her new music, love and why livin' ain't killed her yet. Tell us about your new album Love Somebody.It's a love album. The overall theme is love---whether you're falling in or falling out, being rejected or trying to find it, it's about love. It's an eclectic collection of emotion. Some of the songs are happy. Some of them are sad. Some of them are hopeful. A lot of them have sass or are sexy. It's just all over the place, but the main theme is love. I like how you say ""sass."" Over the years your music has become sassier. Have you?I think I have. I think I'm very comfortable in my own skin, and I'm not out to impress everybody. What you see is what you get. So, I do think I'm a little sassier with more attitude now. What is your process for finding the songs you record?It hasn't changed in many, many years. I let publishing companies and my favorite writers and writers I haven't even worked with yet know that I'm going to record. Then they start sending me demos. I listen and listen. I also have this team of people looking for songs and trying to find those 10 or 12 or 15 songs that we can go into the studio and start recording. When one feels like it's not getting there---like trying to fit a round peg into a square hole---we just go on to the next one. So, by the time we go into the studio, we have found songs that I'm in love with, and that's the way it has to be. If I sing it and I get a feeling of some sort of emotion that really touches my heart, hopefully it will touch your heart when you hear it. I read that you wondered if radio would even play your new music because radio tends to always be looking for younger and newer artists. You have sold over 56 million albums---How could country radio not play your music? There comes a point in your career when you've got to make room for the new people coming up. When Scott Borchetta [Founder of Big Machine Records] asked me if I wanted to record a new album, I asked him why. I didn't understand what his point was. Then he told me they were starting radio stations where they were playing old and new stuff. I told him they have plenty of old stuff, and he said, ""Yeah, but we want new material from you to play on those radio stations."" I was really excited because I love being on the radio. Who wouldn't? And I love getting back in the game and in the swing of things.On Twitter you recently said, ""I've been around and in this business a long time and just between you and me, it ain't killed me yet."" Who or what do you credit your staying power?Curiosity, ambition and competition. I really love competition. I always have. Ever since I started in 1976 I've taken little baby steps all the way. It was a growing process where I got to spread my foundation really firm and thick and strong instead of just jumping in the deep end. I have a lot of friends to thank for my success, and I couldn't have done it without them. Since beginning in the business how have you grown?  Oh my gosh, how haven't I grown? (I think) watching the technology change, learning from other people how to find songs or what makes a good song, going with my gut instincts, and surrounding myself with the wonderful team of people who are smarter than me. Do you ever put on your old records and sing along?I don't sing along, but I do listen to my music every once in a while. I think one of my favorite albums is Starting Over Again. That's an album of songs I wish I had recorded first. You have always been adventurous in your career. What is something you'd still love to tackle? I'd love to do a good ol' western movie. I grew up on westerns. I'd love to do more television. I'd love to do more Broadway. Speaking of new ventures, you're heading to Las Vegas with Brooks & Dunn in June to do shows at Caesars Palace. What can the audience expect? I'm really looking forward to that. The hardest thing about putting it together was deciding which songs we were going to perform. They have a huge catalog. I've got a huge catalog. We've sat down and selected our favorites. That's kind of what you have to do first. Then you have to make sure those favorites are the fans' favorites. They are the most important because they are the ones who got us to where we are today. We got our stage and the set is ready to be built. So, we're really in the process of building the whole show together. It's going to be a really entertaining evening for those who come to see Brooks & Dunn and Reba at Caesars.What's your favorite song to sing live?""Fancy."" Another song I've really enjoyed doing on stage is off the new album. It's called ""Until They Don't Love You."" It's the most fun song I've gotten to sing on stage in a long time. Speaking of new songs, one is called ""Livin' Ain't Killed Me."" Life is filled with ups and downs. The ups are always exciting, but how have you gotten through the downs?I think my faith in God has really helped me get through the rough times in my life. I believe everything happens for a reason. I don't know what that reason is. That will be one of the questions I ask when I get up there, for sure. Since your new album is all about the journey of love, let's talk about your journey. You will celebrate your 26th wedding anniversary in June. What has been the key to your marriage?Narvel and I work together. We have since 1980. We make a great team on getting everything together with the career. Having good communication is really important, too. Before I let you go, after all of the albums, tours and other projects, what do you think is your legacy on country music?Whoa. That's hard to say. Shoot, I really don't have a clue. Somebody else would have to answer the question. The songs are the a-number-one thing. If you don't have that good song to put out on the radio or to sing in concerts, you may as well stay at home. ""To Love Somebody"" is available April 14. For more information, visit www.reba.comPhoto: Jeremy Cowart Album Cover: Nash Icon Records"

Before I let you go, after all of the albums, tours and other projects, what do you think is your legacy on country music?Whoa. That's hard to say. Shoot, I really don't have a clue. Somebody else would have to answer the question. The songs are the a-number-one thing. If you don't have that good song to put out on the radio or to sing in concerts, you may as well stay at home. ""To Love Somebody"" is available April 14. For more information, visit www.reba.comPhoto: Jeremy Cowart Album Cover: Nash Icon Records"
23,EDUCATION,What Little League Baseball Tells Us About the Skills Gap,"Blair Forlaw, ContributorStrategist, Enthusiast, Connector",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-little-league-baseball-skills-gap_b_7028808.html,"Talent is fueled by a natural curiosity and love of learning that is either encouraged -- or squelched -- at a very early age.  By the time we reach peak earning years, we've spent thousands of hours mastering what we need.",2015-04-10,2015-04-08-1428529193-124544-BaseballSummerCamp.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-08-1428529193-124544-BaseballSummerCamp-thumb.jpg,"You might not see it when driving past your local sports field, but trouble lurks beneath the dirt. Every year for the past 16, enrollment in Little League baseball has steadily dropped, according to reporting in the Wall Street Journal. One or two percentage points annually is the kind of slow but steady erosion that escapes notice until it's almost too late to do anything about it. Could the foundation of one of America's most treasured traditions be crumbling away, right below our feet? It's deja vu all over again, as Yogi Berra might have said. It's a lot like what has happened to jobs and skills -- all-American mainstays that also aren't what they used to be. Not too long ago, winning in the workplace was about being dependable, consistent, loyal, a good sport. Then suddenly, we turn around and the labor market looks like a whole new playing field, with different positions, unfamiliar rules, and a lot of people on the sidelines. What's going on?Here are three clues to help us answer that question by better understanding the demand for skills in today's market and the gap between where we career-seekers are and where businesses wish we would be. The list was inspired by ""Behind the Curve,"" a story about Little League Baseball that Marc Fisher wrote recently for The Washington Post. 1. Training happens on and off the field. Training for baseball doesn't begin at a skills camp; it starts with the ""fever"" that many future fans and players catch as children when they open the gift of a glove or bat, watch their first game from the stands, or practice hitting the ball in the backyard. ""The transmission of baseball fever relies heavily on the father-son dynamic,"" according to Fisher's sources in Major League Baseball, ""whereas other sports are often taught in school or by peers."" By the time the team brings home that first real trophy, many Little League players have spent many hours learning the game and polishing their skills informally in the backyard with family, at batting cages or the playground, with youth groups or church clubs, in the street with neighbors. And so it is with the skills required for today's world of work. We don't begin learning when we start school -- and we don't stop when we graduate college, either. Talent is fueled by a natural curiosity and love of learning that is either encouraged -- or squelched -- at a very early age. By the time we reach peak earning years, we've spent thousands of hours mastering what we need to know from a wide range of experiences in classrooms, internships, workplaces, community service projects, peer groups, professional associations, libraries, mentoring relationships, and online. Even as video games and computers draw some young people away from baseball, digital technology attracts them to new opportunities to master work-relevant skills ""any time, any place, and at any pace."" Today, ""prior learning assessments"" are gaining in popularity as a tool to assess the value of out-of-school learning, and an emergent ecosystem of digital badges, nano-degrees, and industry certifications are being used to validate learning and nudge the entire educational system towards more granular credentials that measure competencies rather than seat time. 2. To be a specialist or an all-round flexible player: there's the conundrum. There is a noticeable trend toward specialization in youth sports, and Little League doesn't compete well when sides are being picked. After all, ""by espousing the virtues of character, courage and loyalty,"" Little League aims ""to develop superior citizens rather than stellar athletes,"" according to the association website. Many serious players are joining ""travel teams and other selective, intensive programs"" in other sports, according to David Odgen, a University of Nebraska at Omaha researcher quoted by Fisher. This trend not only diverts some from baseball, but favors youth who come from families and communities that can afford the cost of select sports. The tension between narrow specialization and broad adaptability is very real in the workplace, as well, and it presents a conundrum for job-seekers and educators alike. On the one hand, as global competition gets sharper and innovation more essential, employers place high value on people who have deep knowledge in a specific area and know how to apply that knowledge creatively. But employers also list adaptability and flexibility among the most in-demand 21st Century competencies. According to a study cited by Fareed Zakaria, as many as 84 percent of employers say ""they would rather hire smart, passionate people, even if they didn't have the exact skills their companies needed."" Conflicting pressures toward both specialized and broad skills have contributed to some interesting hybrids in the workplace and in higher education. McKinsey & Company reports that ""about one-third of the new jobs created in the US over the past 25 years were types that did not exist, or barely existed, 25 years ago."" The examples they provide include occupations that span diverse areas, such as computer systems analysts (business and technology) and fitness instructors (health and recreation). College students are pursuing programs (some of their own creation) that give them credentials that are both specialized and cross-cutting. There is an increase in double majors at the undergraduate level (such as foreign languages and business, art and psychology) and dual degrees at the graduate level (such as JD and MSW or MD and MBA). And adults looking for new careers have driven up demand for stackable credentials that evidence a specialized set of skills on top of a more general background.3. To win, we've got to be able to think ahead and respond to the present moment. Fifteen-year-old Austin Albericci explained to Fisher why he left Little League: ""Baseball players are thinking ahead all the time, always thinking of the possibilities -- 'If I can't get to second, do I throw to first?' Baseball is a bunch of thinking, and I live in a different lifestyle than baseball. In basketball and football, you live in the moment. You got to be quick. Everything I do, I do with urgency."" Thinking ahead or being in the moment may be an either/or situation in youth sports, but it's both/and at work. Employers say they want employees to be able to think on their feet and solve problems effectively as they arise, whether that means quickly replacing a machine part or soothing a disgruntled customer right on the sales floor. But employers also put ""critical thinking"" near the top of their list of key competencies. It's not just a matter of immediate job security: being able to think critically and creatively is part of what separates humans from machines in today's increasingly automated world. Zakaria writes: ""Critical thinking is, in the end, the only way to protect American jobs."" He cites a 2013 study on employment by two scholars at Oxford who found that ""for workers to avoid the computerization of their jobs, 'they will have to acquire creative and social skills.'"" Sports players may be able to choose between games that require them to think ahead and others that are more in-the-now, but we career-seekers are in a new normal where being able to stay attentive to today, anticipate tomorrow, and creatively bridge the gap are all work requirements. So, with all this kind coming at us, who's concerned about their bench strength? According to Fisher's reporting, both Little League and Major League Baseball are. According to the Society for Human Resources Management, employers are, as well. Many of the challenges they face are quite different, but there is something to be learned in the similarities. Perhaps strategy ideas could be shared in the parents' bleachers at an upcoming Little League game -- batter's eye view."
24,GREEN,These People Are Doing Something About California's Awful Drought,James Gerken,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doing-something-about-the-drought_n_7000126.html,,2015-04-09,"Motorists pass a sign, Thursday, April 2, 2015, in Rancho Cordova, Calif., reminding them to reduce water use due to the statewide drought, as they drive on Highway 50. California Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday, ordered a 25 percent overall cutback in water use by cities and towns, but not farms, in the most sweeping drought measures ever undertaken by the nation's most populous state. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb167d52200004301db4d39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California's drought is serious. The U.S. Drought Monitor currently lists more than 40 percent of the state in the highest category, ""exceptional drought"" -- up from 23 percent a year ago. The state's drought is the most severe in at least 1,200 years, according to a study that examined the drought between 2012 and 2014.Officials have implored Californians to cut down on water usage, but recent data show residents saved less water in February than in any other month since the state started tracking water conservation. Southern California residents actually used more water than average that month. Solving the state's drought isn't going to be simple, or quick, and it will require technology, improved efficiency and conservation. But everyone can do something. Here are seven examples of people who are doing their part:California's Craft Breweries  Brewing beer takes a lot of water -- beer is mostly water, after all -- and California has 381 craft breweries, more than any other state.Last year, Bear Republic Brewing Company installed a water-recycling, energy-generating system at its facility in Cloverdale, which is one of the communities most vulnerable to running out of water. The system is designed to help supply more than 10 percent of the brewery's water needs and help lower its water-to-beer-produced ratio. The brewery also paid for two new wells to supply more water to the city of Cloverdale.Other breweries, like Lagunitas, Sierra Nevada, Stone and Green Flash, have opened or are building new brewing facilities on the East Coast or in the Midwest. The companies aim to increase supply and cut down on transportation costs, among other things, but expanding their businesses without using more California water is an added bonus.People Removing Their Lawns The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works is currently offering a ""Cash for Grass"" rebate to residents who replace their lawns with water-efficient landscaping like rocks, mulch or drought-tolerant plants.One Los Angeles company is taking advantage of the program by removing lawns at no cost and sharing some of the rebate with the homeowners. Many residents have applauded the approach, but some other landscapers are concerned that the company is installing non-native plants.Gov. Jerry Brown  Last week California's governor announced mandatory water cutbacks for the first time in the state's history. The state's Water Resources Control Board plans to enforce a 25 percent water use reduction in every city, which is projected to conserve about 488 billion gallons of water over the next nine months.Since requiring these cutbacks, Brown has received criticism for not extending the water restrictions to the state's agriculture sector -- which accounts for about 80 percent of the state's total water consumption -- or the oil and gas industry.Brown defended the plan in an interview with ""PBS NewsHour,"" saying agriculture is ""fundamental"" to the state and farmers are suffering in the drought as well. ""We’re asking them too to give us information, to file agriculture water plans, to manage their underground water, to share with other farmers,"" he said.He said it wouldn't be fair to impose restrictions on one industry and not another. ""I mean, that is a Big Brother that, outside a war or some absolute unprecedented catastrophe, shouldn’t even be considered,"" he said. The Drop-A-Brick CampaignToilets are the biggest user of household water. Dropping a brick in an older toilet tank is a good way to displace water and save with every flush. Unfortunately, traditional bricks may start to dissolve over time. Enter the Drop-A-Brick. The rubber and hydrogel brick is soft, can fit in tanks of various shapes, and stays submerged by absorbing water. Adding the special brick saves about half a gallon of water per flush, according to its makers -- or about 3,000 gallons per year for the average household.The volunteer-run Drop-A-Brick Project has delivered the initial production run to its backers and plans to deliver a few thousand bricks to sponsors soon, a spokesman told The Huffington Post. The company plans to continue selling the product online at its Indiegogo campaign price of $15. Cody Creighton and Other No-Shower HeroesOjai, California, native Cody Creighton became concerned about the drought last year and started skipping showers. After 50 days without showering, he started a social media campaign last fall and committed himself to 128 shower-free days. Creighton's mission is more to raise awareness than to get Californians to stop showering. In that spirit, here are some tips to cut down on water use in the bathroom. If you're not quite ready for a change as drastic as giving up showers, there are other tweaks you can make to your daily routine that can help -- quitting eating hamburgers is a good start.California's Fracking Protesters Oil and gas producers used about 70 million gallons of water for fracking in 2014, state officials recently told Reuters. This is only equivalent to the annual water use of a little a more than 500 households, according to the state's oil and gas supervisor, but it's still something. All of the state's oil and gas operations created about 42 billion gallons of wastewater in 2014, according to Mother Jones.Fracking operations also produce significant quantities of chemical-laden wastewater, which must be disposed of or processed.Last year it was revealed that billions of gallons of fracking wastewater were being injected into clean aquifers in California that would otherwise supply households or agriculture.California's Dry FarmersDuring the drought, some California farmers have turned to the traditional techniques of dry farming. Farmers avoid water or irrigating crops, and rely on moisture stored up in the soil from the rainy season. Yields are understandably lower when fields are dry-farmed, but the crops often have a more concentrated, potent flavor.Do you live in California or another state affected by drought? What are you doing about it? Share your story with us at green@huffingtonpost.com.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story indicated that California's oil and gas operations used about 42 billion gallons of water in 2014. In fact, the operations created about 42 billion gallons of wastewater that year."

Crafting an agenda for the fall elections has not been easy for congressional Republicans, who, to solicit ideas, set up a Web site, soon flooded by liberals with distinctly un-Republican suggestions. Meanwhile some Republicans don't even agree that they need a new agenda at all. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb167d4240000510096c420.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In case you weren't sure, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell doesn't care for President Obama's climate actions at home and climate diplomacy abroad. He's made that quite clear recently.Last month McConnell wrote the nation's governors, urging them to reject Clean Air Act curbs on power plant carbon pollution. Last week, he forced a vote on a non-binding budget resolution amendment, to take away a power the Environmental Protection Agency does not even have. And this week, he warned ""our international partners"" to ""proceed with caution"" before making a global climate deal with the U.S. later this year.Are these signs of strength, or signs of weakness?However, much McConnell wants to block the president's Clean Power Plan here at home and blow up the emerging international climate agreement, his recent moves signal weakness, not strength.Governors aren't rushing to ""just say no.""McConnell wrote an op-ed and a letter to governors urging states not to cooperate with the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan. But governors aren't rushing to jump on his bandwagon. They know that if a state doesn't write its own clean air plan, then the Clean Air Act requires EPA to regulate the state's power plants directly. Most power companies would rather see states shape the rules, and most governors believe they can do a better job than EPA.And more and more governors -- witness Michigan's Rick Snyder -- are awakening to the economic and job creation opportunities of clean energy. The Washington Postreported yesterday that the wind, solar and natural gas industries created 174,000 new jobs in the last five years, while coal employment fell by 50,000.Most governors greeted McConnell's letter with polite silence. Not California's Jerry Brown: [T]o have the leader of the Senate, Mr. McConnell representing his coal constituents ... putting at risk the health and well being of America, is a disgrace.And here, in full, is Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin's letter back to McConnell: I disagree. Climate change is real. It's a threat to humanity. We should be working harder to address it, not rolling back efforts to do so. I fully support the Environmental Protection Agency's plan.Not one governor has yet pledged to refuse to submit a state plan. So McConnell's not getting traction here.Less than 60 votes.One reason Sen. McConnell may be writing letters is that he is having trouble writing legislation. Last week, the Senate considered hundreds of non-binding amendments to its budget resolution in a spectacle known as the ""vote-a-rama."" Two amendments were proposed relating to the Clean Power Plan. Neither passed -- in fact, one wasn't even brought to a vote.With great fanfare, McConnell himself offered an odd amendment purporting to revoke a power that EPA does not even have. The amendment would have prohibited EPA from taking away federal highway funding from a state that refuses to write its own state plan to implement the Clean Power Plan. This amendment would have accomplished nothing, because EPA does not now have the power McConnell sought to yank. In any case, McConnell's amendment garnered only 57 votes -- short of the 60 needed to pass.The second amendment, sponsored by Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH), would have been far more pernicious. The Portman amendment would have made the Clean Air Act merely optional. A state could ""opt out"" simply by declaring that meeting carbon standards would cost the polluters money -- that compliance would ""impair investments in existing electric generating capacity.""By repealing the national guarantee that makes the Clean Air Act work -- the requirement that EPA step in with federal pollution limits if a state chooses not to act -- Portman's amendment would have taken us back fifty years to the dark days when polluters could play states off against each other -- when there were no national rules to level the playing field and there was no federal back-up when states failed to act.Yet, McConnell chose not to bring Portman's amendment to a vote. We can only speculate why, but a good guess may be that it would have gotten fewer votes than McConnell's highway funding nothing-burger.As Portman hinted in a vote-a-rama post-mortem: ""I don't know, at the end of the day, if there are 60 votes for any of these alternatives.""That's the central point. McConnell has not yet found a way to pass actual legislation to trim the sails of the Clean Power Plan, even symbolically.Messing in foreign policyThis week Sen. McConnell sternly warned leaders of other countries to ""proceed with caution"" before making any global climate deal. Speaking the same day that the United States announced its carbon commitments for the Paris climate negotiations -- to cut U.S. carbon pollution 26-28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025 -- McConnell plainly hoped to sow doubts in foreign capitals about the reliability of our country's readiness to act.Members of Congress used to respect the president's constitutional role to speak for our country with one voice in foreign affairs. But, like the recent letter from 47 Republican Senators to the Iranian mullahs, McConnell's ""just say no"" message to foreign leaders shows that those days are gone.The hypocrisy in McConnell's call is striking. Republicans used to argue against U.S. action to curb carbon pollution because they claimed it wouldn't be matched by action abroad. Now they're arguing against action abroad because, they claim, it won't be matched by action at home.The bottom-line question for foreign observers, however, is how much of a threat does Sen. McConnell's opposition really pose?The conclusion they should draw is that the Senate majority leader lacks the votes to change the Clean Air Act, and he lacks the clout to get governors to reject the Clean Power Plan. And since he lacks the leverage to block our commitment to action at home, he cannot block America's commitment to a meaningful climate agreement in Paris this fall.President Obama has set the United States on a course for real and durable climate action here and abroad. Mitch McConnell doesn't hold the cards to change that."

I especially enjoyed watching my son, Seth, ham it up in the alien costume I made for him. We got photos at Center Camp and in front of the many spaceship art installations placed around the Playa. He would interact with everyone, give high-fives and dance. One guy at Center Camp just grabbed him and stared doing acro-yoga with him. He ended up in a perfect flight pose. I enjoyed watching those who saw him get a little freaked out, but wind up with huge smiles. That's what it's all about, right?",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baec6fa2100002501c6f69f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"No one really knows whether we're alone or if the universe is brimming with brainy extraterrestrials. But that hasn't stopped scientists from trying to figure out what form intelligent aliens might take. And as University of Barcelona cosmologist Dr. Fergus Simpson argues in a new paper, most intelligent alien species would likely exceed 300 kilograms (661 pounds)--with the median body mass ""similar to that of a polar bear.""If such a being had human proportions, Simpson told The Huffington Post in an email, it would be taller than Robert Wadlow, who at 8 feet, 11 inches is believed to have been the tallest human who ever lived. (Story continues below photo.)  Robert Wadlow (1918-1940), the tallest man who ever lived.Simpson's paper, which is posted on the online research repository arXiv.org, is chockablock with formidable-looking mathematical equations. But as he explained in the email, his starting point was to consider the relationship between the number of individuals in a population on Earth and the body mass of those individuals:""Ants easily outnumber us because they are small. Our larger bodies require a much greater energy supply from the local resources, so it would be impossible for us to match the ant population. Now apply this concept to intelligent life across the universe. On average, we should expect physically larger species to have fewer individuals than the smaller species. And, just like with countries, we should expect to be in one of the bigger populations. In other words, we are much more likely to find ourselves to be the ants among intelligent species.""Or, as Newsweek explained Simpson's argument, there are probably more planets with relatively small animals than planets with relatively large animals. It makes sense to assume that Earth is in the former category, so we can assume that humans are probably among the smaller intelligent beings.What do other scientists make of Simpson's paper?“I think the average size calculation is reasonable,” Dr. Duncan Forgan, an astrobiologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who wasn't involved in the research, told Newsweek. But to Dr. Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., the argument is suspect.""There is an assumption here that intelligence can come in all (reasonable) sizes, and does so with more or less equal likelihood,"" Shostak told The Huffington Post in an email. ""That may be true, but on Earth bigger has not always been better, at least in the brains department. Dolphins have higher IQs than whales, and crows are smarter than eagles. Octopuses are cleverer than giant squids, and obviously we’re smarter than polar bears.""Ultimately, Shostak said, we can’t know whether ""little green men are actually big green men"" before we actually make contact.Until then!"

The Voting Rights Act was signed in 1965. I turned sixteen in 1980, the first year I had anal sex and a year before The Gay Disease hit the nightly news. I lost my father to suicide in 1969, the same year we walked on the moon and opened up a door to hope. I only remember one of those events. I'm the youngest of five children, two boys, two girls, then me. It's the unevenness of my life that made me want to find my place. They told me I was gifted in elementary school, privileged, the playground where boys psychologically tortured me with name-calling and physical threats, and where I had no friends. I'd go home in the afternoon and hide in our over-size rabbit cage. That's what ""privileged"" meant in my suburban hometown. I cut classes and said I was sick and lost grades because I wanted to live. I didn't want to be gifted; I wanted to be slim, athletic, popular. Someone. After I had my first book published, finally, at forty, three years after the age my dad gave up this world, 25 years after my first professional writing gig, 24 years after I was first taken to a psychiatrist because I couldn't get the thought of death out of my head, I stared at my words on a Barnes & Nobel shelf, seeing a dream that was so obvious to me but took the shifting of earth's plates for others to recognize. Someone from home told me I didn't deserve success, even after all that.I've learned that accomplishment for other people's sake is self-destructive. I try to remind myself of that lesson every day. I moved to New York in the winter of 1987, just after mental illness had destroyed my actor dreams, and years before medications made them show up in the daylight again. In 1989 I had my first HIV test; I had my last one six months ago. The results are the same, but history smoothed over the bumps. There's something called PrEP and barebacking is routine. People used to sit across the room from each other and jerk off in the cold living room of someone else's home. Intimacy was literally dying in their bedrooms. I now get regular offers to ""breed"" men, often groups of men, many of them about the same age I was in 1989. Some PNP, some 420 friendly--so was I in ninth grade, after school or at rock concerts; Poppers (we called it ""Rush"") were dull by the age of fifteen--all of them are lovely and welcoming, on a journey that I can almost share. But the idea of a man cumming inside of me evokes an image of a saw being shoved up and down my insides. There are some horrors you can't shake. Remember STDs? They're almost retro. They were really big in 1979, the year before Ronald Reagan was the first President not to speak its name. By 1990 I'd finally developed muscles, when almost everyone whom I'd met at the last all-male gym in Chelsea had succumbed to the collapse of their own mass; sweet men, sexy men, the first men who treated me as an attractive equal, something I'd craved since childhood, all of them infected before I got here, most of them rotting on those revered streets around me. Those streets are now Taylor Swift Starbucks country, where haters be hatin' and my generation is called a cliché. When I first glimpsed the lights of a nightclub across from a Central Park West hotel room when I was fourteen, on a family vacation, I knew I needed to be there, here. On the same trip we saw Dancin', and I was infatuated with one of the guys in the show. We waited outside for autographs afterward, and, as my siblings complained and Mom sought out Ann Reinking, I saw him come out with another man, their waists touching, intimate and protected. He said good night to the cast--I remember him tossing out the name ""Charmaine""--and they walked down the humid gray that turned into black brilliance, abandoning me from my entitled world. When I finally got here, at twenty-two, any notion of re-creating that freedom image had also deserted me.Now that I'm fifty years old, still in Manhattan, a couple of miles away from my first apartment, and a world away in almost every other respect, I see many things in this city that's been home longer than any other place. There's painful memories and sadness, some of it crippling, fear of getting older when it's cold, missed opportunities, and so much sentiment in springtime Chelsea I want to grab the bits of men I knew, their laughs and looks and color like tulips, and hurl them into Glinda's ball so she can toss them to the skies.Most of all there's life, present tense, in so many ways just beginning. I'm a Daddy now, if labels are used, a noun I appreciate and am flattered to hear. In other ways said by other people I'm old, not someone who should be starting out or dreaming or metaphorically pulling the pigtails of attractive men. In the worst ways, I'm a tired old queen, the label I get from younger gay men whenever I write about a subject that doesn't appeal to them. It's not much of a distance from the names I was called as a kid, except it's my liberated successors who are now undermining my worth. Last year I acted in a commercial and was featured in a couple of videos. I had fun, especially after a 20-year medical leave. I look forward to more. When I was ten I was the youngest actor in the room, a performer at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. Now I just act like I'm the youngest, wherever I am. If you're fortunate enough to live half a century, you'll understand that it isn't that youth is wasted on the young, it's that youth has no bearing on happiness. It also has no expiration date or emotional start. To imply otherwise is punishment by thoughtless proxy. If you're smart enough to live fully, you'll also know that it isn't just what fifty looks like. ""This Is 50"" material images of ourselves are too easily manipulated, artificially or superficially. It's what fifty, forty, thirty, twenty feels like. Nobody has an infallible plan, until you're immortalized in death, yet the rules of age exist. I would have thought better of us. If we build on a life-by-numbers bridge, we'll prematurely kill off the impact of others and our own inevitable ups and downs. Some people soar in high school or college, then dwindle down a drain. Anyone thrilled by their childhood peers' falls is regurgitating the cycle of dismissal, gay men who have made their own decision that youth begins after college. Or whatever age they stamp as young. High school never really ends, but our enrollment can stop. Some of us get trapped in marriage, kids, even if wonderfully so. Some go broke or bankrupt and some sniff up their millions. Some hide their lives behind spouses, or careers, or bruises, some men come out at seventy. Some learn to paint, whenever. Some, like my mom, stay overnight in an Italian youth hostel when they're eighty. Some are lost, or just not fully formed, in their teens, in their twenties, in their sixties. Some collapse in the middle, briefly, then reemerge. Age is a jigsaw puzzle, with pieces being filled in from corners and the middle and the edges. All that's certain is a starting point. And the celebration of filling in the picture. And some of us get sick and die. Diseases of the mind and body thwart life, accidents too, and they're fickle in their choices. Where I come from, in that politically correct timeline of youth, late in life meant forty, if you were lucky, or just the opposite if your decay dragged out. Old age didn't exist. Life existed in the moment and it didn't give you time to think or plan or mope. It didn't give you time. My twenties was the worst decade of my life, for reasons beyond my grasp of heaven. I suffered from a rare form of OCD called Intrusive Thoughts, a broken brain in layman's terms, and past the drugs that didn't work and the spiritual exercises that didn't work and the therapists that didn't work and the freedom that lived in memory, alcohol worked. It was like throwing water on loose electrical wires. If I drank enough I could actually feel pleasure. My only restraint was holding off the blackout. If that was my prime, then I should have ended it by the time I was thirty. That decade was the last hoorah for too many others, and we owe it to them to honor the rewards of age. I'm either the end of the gay line or the beginning, since those under me are awake in a world of marriage and children and entertainment mirrors, and those above me are dead. I have no father figures, literally or figuratively, and if I'm to believe what I read in many gay circles, I'm immature because I did not start planning a family by the time I turned thirty. Ignorance is forever young. So are my beautiful peers, hedged in between two worlds and extracting wisdom from both. They are called Daddy's too. Now it makes sense because we've all lost him. It hurts when people tell me I'm too old to dream in the daylight, to turn my imagination active and produce. I'm not always proud enough to overcome bias even if I can't comprehend the seeds of such a despotic policy. When I'm ashamed I dig up the past and my alternatives and the men whose memory made me. If Grindr existed in 1987 it would be a smartphone AIDS quilt. Profiles would vanish daily, photos would be replaced by red ribbons, instead of stats you'd read short remembrances and how close, in exact feet, the memorial services were taking place. Between ""Read My Lips"" and Silence = Death and every man except a Daddy at your fingertips, it would sum up the gay plague in the palm of your hand. The beeps on your phone would be alarm clocks for who just left and who's next. Like physical youth, we've passed that world, for now, and everything else is fleeting. If being gay today means learning which way to swipe a thumbnail and how to shake it off, then good for us. It's time for a breather. If being fifty, for me, feels new, great for me. It doesn't really matter if I'm between worlds or between generations or on the wrong side of fashion or the other side of someone else's hill. Too often were kicked off the one we're still climbing. It only matters that I'm embracing my infinity, my star, in gay years for however long this place exists."

As a brief refresher, here are some facts.As soon as you sit down, your calorie burning drops to one per minute. By sitting more than six hours a day, you're up to 40 percent likelier to die within 15 years than someone who sits less than three hours, even if you exercise. Sitting leads to a greater risk of colon, breast, and endometrial cancers, while causing tight hips, limp glutes, and soft bones. Are you standing yet?Even though 90 percent of adults claim to have experienced some level of back pain, it's also true that perpetually standing isn't a healthy solution, either. Nor is it realistic. Americans spend on average 60 percent of their waking hours sedentary, sitting approximately 9 hours a day. So what to do? Sitting less is an obvious improvement. Some, like Dr. James Levine, recommend treadmill desks, which reportedly improve health and productivity. And anyone who's ever worked an office job knows the benefits of taking a lap every hour or so. But sitting is unavoidable. You can't pace up and down the aisle of an airplane during your flight, or in a theatre during the movie. In most culture's it's impolite to jog in place while eating a burrito. The solution is not simply sitting less; it's sitting better.Consider the following image:Look familiar? Now look at this image from the University of Western Australia, depicting proper posture. While fixing your posture is the first step toward an improved relationship with the seated position, unfortunately it's not just sitting that does the damage. According to New York back surgeon Kenneth Hansraj, looking down at a cellphone is equivalent to placing a 60-pound weight on your neck, like giving a shoulder ride to an 8-year-old every time you text. Such strain is unnecessary. Raise your hands and arms from your lap to your chest. It will increase your head extension and improve your neck posture by taking away the unnecessary strain. Other ways to remove strain? Don't be a potato. Take a walk. Do some pushups. Change your workspace to better accommodate your needs. But when you do inevitably sit back down, sit better. Dr. Kelly Shockley recommends balls. Sitting on an exercise ball strengthens core muscles that stabilize your spine by providing an instability, automatically provoking your body to stay balanced. I recently launched a product, BetterBack, that allows you to effortlessly sit in perfect posture. It's lightweight and portable so you can throw it in your bag and make every chair you sit on throughout the day ergonomic. Dr. BJ.

Dr. Kevin Kita recommends putting your feet on a small foot stool or books about 4 to 6 inches high when you're on the computer or reading in a seated position. Most people lean forward with their neck and round their lower back when they're on the computer, or reading. Lifting your feet helps you lean back and alleviates the pain this can cause. 2. Dr. Dot Stein recommends weekly swim sessions. Three times a week will strengthen your core, naturally improving posture and spine health. When you're hurting, swing by a sauna. Heat alleviates musculoskeletal pain. 3. To correct ""computer neck,"" Dr. Barry Marks recommends leaning your head back as far as it will go. You should feel tension where the skull meets your neck and at the base where your neck meets your shoulders. Hold the position for ten seconds. Repeat this exercise throughout the day. It loosens up the hinge points in your upper body to help reposition your head over your shoulders. 4. When watching TV or reading, Dr. Robert Gearhart Jr. recommends periodically lying on your stomach. Over time, this form of stretching or ""passive exercise"" helps maintain the natural curve in your spine. The body position emulates the famous Cobra yoga position that benefits posture, except now you can multitask. Bonus!"

30,WORLDPOST,What Do Syrians Want?

In the spirit of this important effort, I present the following interview with Talal Barazi, Program Associate with the Foundation to Restore Equality and Education in Syria (FREE-Syria), a civil society development and humanitarian support organization, about the Syrian Freedom Charter, a momentous initiative inspired by the South African Freedom Charter.The Syrian Freedom Charter is a national unity document based on tens of thousands of face-to-face interviews with Syrians, in every governorate of the country, about what kind of society they want. Over the course of a year, a team of over a hundred activists assembled by FREE-Syria and the Local Coordination Committees (LLC) of Syria, completed more than 50,000 surveys.How did the South African Freedom Charter influence the Syrian Freedom Charter?The Syrian Freedom Charter used the South African Freedom Charter as a model from which to work. The biggest influence the South African Freedom Charter had on the Syrian counterpart was in the idea. We also leveraged the expertise of a university professor who was involved with South Africa's ANC for more than 30 years, and other experts with experience in other conflicts (Ireland, South America). In the final analysis, we consider the Freedom Charter a national unity document, in which the vision of the Syrian people is the only component. We also used the format of the South African predecessor to lay out the vision of the Syrian people.How representative is the Freedom Charter? The introduction refers to Syrians ""from our diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, and religious sects"". How much of a cross-section of Syrian society does the document represent? Were Syria's minority communities genuinely included? Can you provide some numbers?  As a document of national unity, the target number of surveys for the Freedom Charter was done proportionally based on districts, not based on ethnicities or religious sects. To get a proportional representation of all districts, we looked at the percentage each district made up of the total population, and set our goal for each district, proportionally, based on that. We did work in areas with prominent minority presence such as Sweida, a governorate known for the high presence of Druze, and Hassaka, a governorate with a large number of Kurds. The work was harder in predominantly Alawite areas and Damascus proper.With that, we see that 50% of people chose not to disclose their ethnicity, and 36% of people chose not to disclose their religious beliefs. Below are the graphs for the demographic questions.How would you respond to the argument that the sentiments and ideals expressed in the Freedom Charter represent only a thin layer of Syrian society -- an elite sector that is educated, westernized, urban, and/or living in exile -- and that the sectarian violence the country has descended into is a more realistic reflection of popular sentiments and political loyalties? This view has been advanced by Joshua Landis, for example, but it's widely shared across all sorts of ideological boundaries.  There is nothing elitist about the Freedom Charter -- in fact, it is truly ""the voice of the people."" The Freedom Charter represents the opinions of ordinary Syrians -- more than 50,000 -- the majority of whom live inside Syria under abysmal conditions imposed by the Assad regime and other militarized groups. The actual surveys were conducted at the grassroots level. Activists surveying in a specific district were locals of the district. 99% of surveys done were completed inside Syria and in neighboring countries that currently host a large number of refugees. The only precondition for surveys was that respondents be Syrian, without regard to ethnicity, religious affiliation, political affiliation, or social/economic status.There's a lot of discussion now of finding a political solution in Syria -- some sort of negotiated settlement. Of course that's not a new idea, but for a while it seemed to have receded from the horizon with the failure of the Geneva process, the exasperated resignation of both Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi as Special Envoy for Syria, and the seemingly intractable geopolitical deadlock over Syria. Recently, however -- with the new geostrategic equation created by the intervention against ISIS -- the push for a political solution is being revived. Various proposals have been floated, and virtually all of them involve Assad staying in power in some form. So my question for you is: the Freedom Charter doesn't directly address the issue of political transition -- how to get from the current moment to the political order outlined in the document -- but from your point of view is there ANY scenario in which it would be acceptable for Assad to remain in power, or does the Freedom Charter necessarily preclude that?  For more than three years, Syrians have taken to the streets in both nonviolent and armed resistance to state what they do not want. The goal for the Freedom Charter was to express to the world what Syrians do want. The document does not discuss the transition period, nor the current situation; it is purely a statement of what Syrians are demanding. The Freedom Charter articulates the desires and goals of the Syrian people, not the process to achieve them.With regard to the political process, FREE-Syria certainly advocates nonviolent solutions. However, the Assad regime has proven, through the failed initiatives of Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi, that it is not prepared to pursue a political process. Rather, the regime has and continues to use deadly force, including chemical weapons, against civilians, particularly children. We do not foresee a future in which Assad or those regime supporters with blood on their hands can play a lasting role in a peaceful, democratic Syria.For more on the Syrian Freedom Charter, go here.

Asking questions. And Passover is nothing if not a holiday about questions. So... L.D. & Passover? A perfect match.It was the AHA Gefilte Fish moment. Sweet memories of Passovers Past were swirling in my head -- from Maxwell House Hagaddahs to mom's matzoh ball soup. A wandering Jew in search of a Seder, I was beginning to feel the tug of darkness. And then the light bulb went off.What better way to celebrate the holiday of the Four Questions than laughter? So, on a whim, I plunked down my week's savings for a last-minute ticket to Fish in the Dark, Larry David's comedy about a death in the family. Why not? After all, it was the perfect antidote to life's bitter herbs. A glass of Manischevitz to wash down the michigas. L.ifting D.oomComedian Larry David might just have the ultimate solution to global gloom. His direct, Let-me-ask-you-this approach to life is the great escape from bondage, the solution to a colliding L.D. world called ""L.ife D.ilemmas."" His answer? Grope in the dark. Explore. Question Everything. L.ine D.rive - My own family is famous for asking endless details, so I totally get it. Larry hits the questions right to us: low, fast and furious. (His: Is it walk the walk or talk the walk? Mine: Why is gefilte fish pike, not mackerel?) I could practically hear Larry ask, ""Why Moses, not Zorro?"" Or ""Why the Red Sea, not the Mediterranean?"" L.ucid D.ream - L.D. is a beam in the night. He turns morbid into cinnamon babka, and we just feel better. Mundane becomes humane. He makes us see clearly amidst the murkiness of night. Relatives quibble, competing for ""Best Eulogy"" award at a funeral service. And seriously, who dares to question how long dead bodies should languish? Or why they shouldn't be removed as quickly as busboys clear tables?  The L.ow D.own - Turns out, when you are feeling low down, it's possible to reach out to anyone, from the Pope to, well, say, Larry David. I did. Maybe it's a Jewish thing. Maybe it's a neurotic thing. Or maybe it's just a manic-comic-depressive thing, enriched by the synchronicity of matzohs and macaroons.But whatever it is, more celebrities should be like Larry David. Approachable.L.ong D.istance Questions - Flash back to April 1993. Ready to lose my network news job, I took a stab in the dark. I wrote a limerick to Larry after the famous DOLORES episode of Seinfeld, questioning the pronunciation of a female body part (the one that rhymed with Jerry's date, whose name he couldn't remember). I called the next day to follow up. Suddenly Larry David was on the phone, listening to my jobless plight, grabbing his Webster's dictionary to check the pronunciation. Should the emphasis be on the first or second syllable? The conversation was, in a word, priceless.L.aboratory D.evelopment - We chatted about many things over the next few months, from our parallel lives (our fathers had been diagnosed at the same time with the same illness), to our creative projects, evolving like petri dish experiments in high school biology labs. Could I watch a taping? Could I come say hello? Could I audition? He kept encouraging, and kept questioning. Lincoln Douglas L.D. Debates - Fast forward to Christmas Day, 2014. Logic. Ethics. Values. An LD trifecta. It was a Yuletide shot in the dark, but I'd heard Larry was writing a Broadway play and wanted to invite him onto my weekly radio show. He'd been spotted at the bar of a certain hotel reading the Sunday New York Times op-ed. I felt the sudden urge to call him up. I was feeling nostalgic, and missing my parents, whose 67th anniversary, and Hanukkah, had just passed. Was it the curious coincidence of melancholy, menorahs and mistletoe? That December 25th, sitting in a drafty Starbucks, sipping an iced latte, listening to the Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack, I dialed up the hotel and asked for Larry David. Once again, he answered. I reminded him of our once-upon-a-time conversations and how he'd helped me out of a slump by being compassionate, by listening, and by asking questions.Lucy Desi dialogue - This time I was the one asking the questions -- brazen yet respectful. Okay, so he declined being a guest on my radio show. But then he applauded my Chutzpah. And he hung in there while I asked a bit more. Could I watch a rehearsal? Definitely not. Yes, he wavered when I suggested taking a photo to illustrate my article. But give the man credit. He could have been brainstorming with Mel or Jerry or Woody. Yet there he was talking to me, the pronunciation kid from Bayside, Queens. He continued chatting amidst the background coffee shop clatter. Forget about genius. The guy's an Aristotle. And better yet, a mench.Yup. I'd found my Passover niche watching Larry David's bereaved, befuddled Drexel family blink like Gefilte Fish in the Dark. Totally liberating. It was all about finding freedom in laughter... and in asking Questions. Larry David seems to have found the Answers. He's L.D. in theme and variations: Lamb shank in the Desert. Luminescence in the Dark.L.imerick D.edicationWe met through NBC News I've since over paid my dues In comedy clubs In hot rods and hot tubs And selling ladies' shoesI'm still in shock and awed By your genius un-curbed and un-flawed From nothing particular To the vehicular As your laughing slave, I applaud."
