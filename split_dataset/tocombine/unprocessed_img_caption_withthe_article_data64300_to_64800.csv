Bernie Sanders' weakness with black voters is evident in South Carolina. And be careful how you interpret social media data about candidates. This is HuffPollster for Friday, February 19, 2016.CLINTON AND SANDERS RUNNING CLOSE RACE IN NEVADA - Amy Walter: ""[T]he Democratic caucus in Nevada looks neck-and-neck. For months we‚Äôve been assured by the Clinton campaign that as long as Hillary Clinton holds onto her solid support among minority voters, she‚Äôll stave off any serious threat from Bernie Sanders‚Ä¶.Yet, as we head into Nevada this weekend, there‚Äôs evidence that her dominance among minority voters is on shaky ground. Clinton is either tied or just slightly ahead of Sanders in a state where non-white voters are likely to be at least 30 to 35 percent of caucus attendees.‚Äù [Cook] Polling still won‚Äôt help us - Mark Z. Barabak: ‚ÄúIn the ocean of polling that has come to define presidential campaigning, with new numbers released seemingly every hour, there has been but a trickle from Nevada‚Ä¶.Some places are easier to poll than others, which may help explain the dearth of data from Nevada. It is among the most difficult places in the country to survey, meaning any poll numbers should be viewed with even more than the usual amount of caution‚Ä¶.It‚Äôs even harder to guess who will show up at noon Saturday because the Nevada caucuses are a relatively new phenomenon. The first, and only competitive, Democrat caucuses were held here in 2008. That's not much history to go on.‚Äù [LA Times] And polling didn‚Äôt fare well in 2008 - Jon Ralston reminds us just how far off the three polls we have could be: TRUMP LEADS COMFORTABLY IN SOUTH CAROLINA - More from Walter: ‚ÄúOn the Republican side, Ted Cruz‚Äôs firewall is the bloc of southern states that vote between February 20 and the so-called March 1 SEC primary‚Ä¶.Yet, the latest polling out of South Carolina shows that the evangelical firewall is not looking all that fireproof. Almost every poll shows Cruz trailing Trump by double digits. More important, he‚Äôs losing among those evangelical voters he was counting on to boost him to victory. The CNN poll showed Trump besting Cruz with evangelicals by a whopping 19 points (42-23 percent).‚Äù [Cook] SANDERS HAS MADE MINIMAL GAINS WITH SOUTH CAROLINA BLACK VOTERS - HuffPollster: ""Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has spent months trying to win over black voters a demographic that is essential to winning the key primary state of South Carolina -- but a new Monmouth University poll released Thursday shows the Vermont senator has made minimal inroads with the group since November. The poll, in which Sanders trails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 29 percentage points, shows that black South Carolina voters have remained unconvinced that he would do a good job addressing concerns pertaining to African-Americans. Overall, 43 percent of black voters are confident in Sanders compared with 73 percent who are confident in Clinton."" [HuffPost] Sanders faces similar challenges nationally - Mackenzie Israel-Trummel and Ariela Schachter: ""We found that blacks‚Äô evaluations of Clinton were much more positive than their evaluations of Sanders. We asked respondent to rate the candidates on a 'feeling thermometer' that ranges from 0 (very unfavorable) to 100 (very favorable)....On average, blacks gave Clinton a 72 and Sanders a 58 ‚Äî only slightly above the neutral point. Among blacks who are registered to vote and know where to vote, Clinton‚Äôs advantage grows further‚Ä¶.Among black voters age 18-29, the gap between Sanders and Clinton is indeed narrower. But younger black voters still rate Clinton more favorably than Sanders."" [WashPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime).MORE VOTERS FEAR TRUMP THAN SUPPORT HIM - HuffPollster, with Emily Peck: ""Judging by the relentless coverage he gets, you‚Äôd think Donald Trump had this whole president thing sewn up by now. He does not. In fact, more than twice as many voters say they‚Äôre scared of a Trump presidency than actually support the reality TV star‚Äôs bid for the Republican nomination, according to a new USA Today/Suffolk University poll. Thirty-eight percent of voters said they would be 'scared' if Trump scored the GOP nomination, with another 18 percent saying the prospect would leave them 'dissatisfied,...' Trump had the highest 'scare' score of all the leading contenders. The runner-up was Hillary Clinton, with 33 percent of voters fearing the former secretary of state winning the Democratic nomination."" [HuffPost] POPE FRANCIS HOLDS LIMITED POLITICAL INFLUENCE - Emily Swanson: ""Pope Francis' comments Thursday that Donald Trump is 'not a Christian' if he supports a wall along the Mexican border put the Republican presidential contender in the uncomfortable position of being pitted against a more popular political figure, according to recent polling on the pope's standing among Americans and American Catholics. But the poll, conducted in October by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, finds the pope to be a relatively unknown quantity to many Americans and suggests his clout when it comes to influencing American political opinions may be limited."" [AP]TWITTER DATA MIGHT NOT CORRELATE TO VOTER SUPPORT - The 2016 election has been flooded with social media data tracking things like how many Facebook followers and Twitter mentions candidate receive. But a new study finds that, while tracking Twitter data can lead to insight on ""temporal dynamics of public attention toward politics."" it cannot accurately predict support for a party or candidate. The study collected Twitter data over a 3-month period before the 2013 German federal election to see if there was any correlation with polls or the final outcome of the election. The study found that Twitter activity across all metrics was ""largely driven by public attention to politics"" and argues that studies that have found a correlation between Twitter-based metrics and political support were most likely coincidental.

It's called ""Classic Mode,"" and it's all but guaranteed to transform how you experience the narrative in ""Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright"" and ""Conquest,"" out Friday on the Nintendo 3DS.You will become invested in the unique personalities that comprise your army, make a bad decision in a battle and then one of your favorite troops will die.It's infuriating and liable to make you snap your 3DS in half, but it's the right thing to do. Too often are death and mayhem treated as consequence-free in video games. Gunning down enemies in ""Call of Duty"" feels like pulling handfuls of grass out of the dirt. If a party member eats a few too many fireballs in ""Final Fantasy,"" you know resurrection is a Phoenix Down away.But ""Fire Emblem"" forces you to consider those precious digital lives behind the smiling anime faces. The series is at its best when it confronts you with gut-wrenching choices: If you've poured hours into training a particular unit but that unit dies at the end of a difficult mission, is it worth it to just move on and let bygones be bygones? Or should you reset the game and try to make it through the battle without casualties?There isn't really a ""right"" answer, and the lessons you learn from considering each option may inspire emotions you haven't felt before when playing a video game.And it's not just that the characters themselves are brimming with personality, though that's true. They can form relationships with one another depending on how you use them in battle. If you direct two characters to slaughter enemies side by side, they might fall in love, and they might even have children.Imagine how much more wrenching the choices about life and death you make on the battlefield become when you watch your beloved get eviscerated by a drake-riding soldier at the end of a mission you really don't want to repeat. ""Fire Emblem Fates"" presents a fascinating emotional dynamic, one that could really only occur in a video game. It's worth experiencing.""Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright"" and ""Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest"" launch Feb. 19 for $39.99 each."
4,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Picks Up Major Endorsement Of Top South Carolina Democrat,Eliot Nelson and Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-james-clyburn_us_56c73165e4b041136f16a67d,It's a big get for Clinton ahead of the South Carolina Democratic primary.,2016-02-19,Hillary Clinton scored the backing of Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_34_2000_1152%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Hillary Clinton's campaign scored a major endorsement Friday when Rep. James Clyburn, the third-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives and the unofficial dean of South Carolina's Democratic Party, endorsed Clinton's presidential campaign.At a press conference at Allen University on Friday, Clyburn spoke highly of both Clinton and Sanders, but said Clinton was best suited to handle a number of issues, including student loans, income inequality and gender discrimination.""I believe the future of the Democratic Party and the United States will be best served by the expertise and know how of Hillary Clinton,"" Clyburn said. Clyburn also addressed issues of particular importance to the African-American community, including criminal justice reform, restoration of the Voting Rights Act and increasing access to historically black colleges and universities.Clinton, Clyburn said, is the ""best choice to conquer these challenges."" Clyburn, who has previously served as House Majority Whip and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, is a deeply revered figure among the state's black community.In addition to serving 12 terms in Congress, Clyburn began his political career as a civil rights activist in the state, leading his local NAACP chapter at the age of 12 and playing a central role organizing against the state's Jim Crow laws while studying at South Carolina State College, a historically black institution. The endorsement, first reported by The State Thursday night, comes at a crucial juncture for the Clinton campaign. Democratic voters are set to caucus on Saturday in Nevada, where a sizable number of the party's caucusgoers are African-American. Moreover, it comes just over a week before Democratic voters cast their primary ballots in South Carolina, a majority of whose Democratic voters are African-American. Clinton has enjoyed sizable leads in recent Palmetto State polls, and as such cannot afford to win by a slim margin. A Clyburn endorsement goes a long way in padding Clinton's margins here. Clyburn's endorsement also helps Clinton's attempts to maintain her support among African-Americans nationwide. Her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has been trying to chip away at Clinton's standing with that constituency, racking up the endorsements of numerous progressive African-American figures, including Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Erica Garner, the daughter of Eric Garner, whose death at the hands of several New York Police Department officers was caught on tape. Clyburn's endorsement is a significant victory for Clinton, who has been working to mend relations with the congressman since the 2008 cycle. During a campaign stop in Aiken, South Carolina, on Tuesday, Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, praised Clyburn for his work on behalf of the state and endorsed one of his policy proposals to combat poverty.Clyburn was neutral in 2008, but he frequently criticized Hillary Clinton's campaign conduct in the state. In his 2014 memoir, Clyburn revealed that Bill Clinton called him up at 2 a.m. after the state's primary and blamed him for his wife's loss. ""If you bastards want a fight, you damn well will get one,"" Clinton reportedly yelled. Clyburn wrote that he reminded the former president he was neutral, but the former president still ""accused me of causing her defeat and injecting race into the contest.""The congressman said Friday that his head was telling him to remain neutral in this cycle once again, but he decided to go with his heart and endorse Clinton.

From back left are Counselor to the Chief Justice Jeffrey Minear and Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan, Samuel Alito, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The remaining eight justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, the president, other government officials and the public convened at the high court on Friday to say goodbye to the late Justice Antonin Scalia.As law clerks present and past for the late justice stood watch by his casket in the center of the Great Hall, the public walked by it somberly. Some stood prayerfully and made the sign of the cross. Others snapped pictures on their smartphones -- of the casket and the ornate surroundings. Marble busts of prior chief justices looked on from the left and the right. The casket rested on the Lincoln catafalque, which was constructed for the casket of President Abraham Lincoln and has been used for presidents, Supreme Court justices and members of Congress since. Flower arrangements gifted by the House of Representatives and the Senate flanked a nearby image of Scalia -- an artist's rendering from 2007 in which the justice is seen in his judicial robe with his hand on a copy of The Federalist and a wedding portrait of his wife, Maureen, by his side. At the end of the hall, beyond the portrait and the procession, the door to the courtroom was open. Scalia's chair and place on the mahogany bench were draped in black.President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama arrived at the Supreme Court sometime after 3 p.m. to pay their respects. Upon entering the Great Hall, they stood in silence before the casket for a few moments. They then made their way to the justice's portrait, where they exchanged some quiet banter.During the Obamas' visit, the court went into a kind of lockdown mode -- no members of the public were allowed inside, and the line into the court ceased to move. A few people and reporters ran toward the court's north wing to try to catch a glimpse of the president's motorcade.The court didn't say what other dignitaries or public figures might come. But a guestbook by the north entrance listed the signed names of Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and several federal judges, including U.S. Circuit Judge Sri Srinivasan -- one of the names being floated as a potential nominee to replace Scalia. The court will remain open until 8 p.m. for public visitors.[Related: Historic Photos Show Supreme Court Justices' Funerals Through The Years.]Earlier on Friday, Scalia's wife, court staff, clerks and former clerks to the justice stood outside the court as the casket arrived and was carried up the steps by Supreme Court police officers serving as pallbearers. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan stood solemnly in the Great Hall as Scalia's son, the Rev. Paul Scalia, offered a prayer. ""You have called your servant Antonin out of this world,"" said Scalia, a priest in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arlington. ""May he rest in peace.""None of the justices spoke, but in an apparent nod to tradition and their departed colleague, they stood in order of seniority, the same way in which they sit on the bench for official court business.A court spokesperson told The Huffington Post that, unlike prior ceremonies, the justices decided not to line up outside the court to receive the casket -- presumably due to the cold. They instead waited inside for the private ceremony.Before the casket arrived and the court opened its doors, members of the public made a makeshift memorial outside, which included items Scalia mentioned for color in his effusive dissents in last year's same-sex marriage and Obamacare cases.Scalia, a firebrand of legal conservatism and a controversial figure on and off the bench, died suddenly last week, causing a political maelstrom and casting into doubt the future of a number of high-stakes cases that could reshape the nation.""He was an influential American,"" said Army Sgt. Major Michel Pigford, from Falls Church, Virginia, who was in line outside the court in full uniform and said he has served in the military for 28 years. ""I may not share the views that he had, but he was important for America.""Bill Haybyrne, 73, wore a National Rifle Association jacket and said he attended the same New York high school as Scalia -- Xavier High School, a military school in Manhattan. He said the justice graduated six years ahead of him and with a higher rank than he did.""He provided the balance that we've lost. We've lost our sense of the Constitution,"" Haybyrne said. He called the founding document ""immutable,"" and said Scalia was right for choosing to interpret it strictly. If Americans wanted it to say something else, he said, Scalia would tell them to pass a constitutional amendment.Farther back in the line was Nicole Poole, 23, an event planner from the D.C. area who said she is a ""big fan"" of the justice.""I think he did a lot of good work protecting our constitutional rights and doing the work that needed to be done from the bench,"" she said. Asked what she thought of some of Scalia's more controversial opinions -- on issues such as race, abortion and gun rights -- Poole, who is black, didn't seem fazed by them.""His No. 1 thing was the Constitution,"" she said.C-SPAN carried a live broadcast of Friday's pomp and circumstance in and outside the court. The network will also broadcast a funeral mass for Scalia on Saturday from Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception -- the largest Roman Catholic sanctuary in America."

Life is hard. It is very hard. And that was tough. But we hold no ill will toward the Donaldson family, and we, as a group, brothers united in unity, should be praying for that family, because they grieve as well.‚Äù Williams and Ingrid were college sweethearts at the University of Notre Dame. According to the outpouring of support we‚Äôve seen since the crash nine days ago, their love and dedication to each other was evident to anyone who saw them together.‚ÄúShe fit me perfectly -- I know different players that I‚Äôve had over the years have probably gotten tired of me talking about my wife, but I used to always think to myself, ‚ÄòWho else was I going to talk about?‚Äô So that never bothered me,‚Äù Williams remembered, smiling for a moment.The reaction throughout the NBA family to this accident has been overwhelming. Players like Ryan Anderson visited Williams‚Äô home in the days following the crash, and Thunder superstar Kevin Durant couldn‚Äôt get through a media session discussing the Williams family without covering his face and breaking down into tears. Durant was in one of the first rows for Thursday‚Äôs service, joined in the pews by other big names like Gregg Popovich, Chris Paul and Doc Rivers.Ingrid is survived by her five children, three of whom were in the accident alongside her. To them and to all in the audience for his eulogy, Williams preached resilience in the face of pain, faith in the midst of heartache. ‚ÄúThis is hard for my family, but this will work out,‚Äù Williams went on. ‚ÄúAnd my wife would punch me if I were to sit up here and whine about what‚Äôs going on -- [but] that doesn‚Äôt take away the pain. But it will work out, because God calls all things to work out. You just can‚Äôt quit, you can‚Äôt give in.‚ÄùBefore closing his speech and stepping down from the pulpit, Williams once more expressed the need for forgiveness for the other family, embracing and reiterating his powerful message of love, unity and charity in the wake of such tragedy.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not lose sight of what‚Äôs important,‚Äù Williams repeated. ‚ÄúMy wife is in heaven.‚Äù‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt lose her. When you lose something, you can‚Äôt find it -- I know exactly where my wife is.‚ÄùCORRECTION: A previous version of this article referred to the driver as a man.

Bernie Sanders‚Äô (I-Vt.) presidential campaign released on Friday the text of speeches Sanders gave to Wall Street firms -- all zero of them -- in a bid to get Hillary Clinton to do the same for her famously lucrative speeches to Goldman Sachs.The move was a response to Clinton‚Äôs comments at a televised town hall in Las Vegas on Thursday night. Clinton told a self-described Sanders supporter she would release the transcripts of the three speeches -- for which the Wall Street firm paid her a total of $675,000 -- ‚Äúwhen everybody else does the same, because every other candidate in this race has given speeches to private groups, including Senator Sanders.‚ÄùThe Sanders campaign, in effect, called her bet on Friday.‚ÄúSen. Sanders accepts Clinton‚Äôs challenge. He will release all of the transcripts of all of his Wall Street speeches,‚Äù Sanders campaign spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement. ""That‚Äôs easy. The fact is, there weren‚Äôt any. Bernie gave no speeches to Wall Street firms.‚Äù‚ÄúSo now we hope Secretary Clinton keeps her word and releases the transcripts of her speeches,‚Äù Briggs added. ‚ÄúWe hope she agrees that the American people deserve to know what she told Wall Street behind closed doors.‚ÄùClinton told NBC News‚Äô Chuck Todd at the Feb. 4 Democratic debate that she would ‚Äúlook into‚Äù releasing the transcripts.Clinton also insisted at the time that her speeches mainly focused on her foreign policy experience as secretary of state, including her role in the decision to go after Osama bin Laden.Clinton, and former President Bill Clinton, have together earned over $125 million for paid speeches they have given since 2001, according to The New York Times. The speeches to Goldman Sachs have become a major issue in the tight Democratic presidential primary race, with Sanders pointing to the speeches as evidence that Clinton is too cozy with Wall Street and part of a political establishment compromised by the financial influence of special interests.The tactic appears to have contributed to Sanders‚Äô handy victory over Clinton in the New Hampshire primary, where voters said they were suspicious of her Wall Street ties.Also on HuffPost:"
8,QUEER VOICES,"With 'Uncontrolled,' Singer Matt Doyle Gets Sleek, Sexy -- And Brutally Honest",Curtis M.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c754a81500002a000b05e3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_736_noupscale,"On his new album, ‚ÄúUncontrolled,‚Äù Matt Doyle isn‚Äôt shy about pointing out a few of his battle scars, but he‚Äôs ultimately empowered by the loss of love, too.Nowhere is that more apparent than in ‚ÄúMoment,‚Äù the album‚Äôs rock-driven first single. Doyle said the song, which was released Feb. 19, was inspired by his struggle with severe depression last spring. The accompanying video has a much sexier vibe, and shows Doyle reconnecting with an ex-lover (played by Erik Altemus) in a New York hotel room for a woozy tryst.While Doyle has always been open about his sexuality, his latest work may surprise fans familiar with his roles in Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpring Awakening‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Book of Mormon,‚Äù which cultivated a squeaky-clean image. With ‚ÄúUncontrolled,‚Äù the New York-based actor-singer casts that boy-next-door image aside in favor of brutal honesty. Still, he hasn‚Äôt forgotten his cheeky sense of fun, as evidenced by the album‚Äôs promotional imagery, in which he shows off his chiseled physique.‚ÄúI have to be truthful and write music about my own experiences,‚Äù the 28-year-old told The Huffington Post in an interview. As for his decision to cast his pal Altemus in the video, he added, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily about standing on a soapbox and saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm gay,‚Äô but if I‚Äôm writing songs that are coming from an honest place in my life, I‚Äôm certainly not going to make a video with a woman [as a love interest].‚ÄùBoth the album and the video make it easy to see why collaborators like ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù co-director Tony Marion are quick to praise Doyle as ‚Äúone of the most generous creatives working in theater.‚Äù While Doyle has always maintained music as a side project to his theater work, ‚ÄúUncontrolled‚Äù is his first full-length album, and represents his most profound effort as a singer-songwriter to date. He began writing songs last year while starring in the Seattle production of the off-Broadway musical, ‚ÄúJasper in Deadland.‚Äù Although his show was playing to enthusiastic audiences, Doyle reveals that he was struggling behind the scenes.‚ÄúI felt very lonely, and there were a lot of things I just wasn‚Äôt doing for myself,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBroadway has been very good to me; theater has been very good to me. But the album was more about setting creative things up in my life outside of that, that I can do on my own.‚ÄùFollowing a massively successful Kickstarter campaign, Doyle was back in the studio last fall, collaborating with his longtime musical director, Will Van Dyke, as well as Nashville-based musicians Joel Heumann, Tina Parole and Jason Gantt. In many respects, ‚ÄúUncontrolled‚Äù picks up where his two previous EPs leave off, but boasts a polished veneer and feels more sonically cohesive. There are joyous moments on the 13-track pop-rock album, such as the ‚Äò50s-influenced ‚ÄúFall For Me,‚Äù and rousing covers of Sheryl Crow‚Äôs ‚ÄúIf It Makes You Happy‚Äù and Janis Joplin‚Äôs ‚ÄúMe and Bobby McGee,‚Äù which can be heard below. On a somber note, ‚ÄúWhen I Let You Go‚Äù is a standout ballad that recalls Doyle‚Äôs very public breakup with fellow Broadway performer, Ryan Steele.

9,QUEER VOICES,"With 'Uncontrolled,' Singer Matt Doyle Gets Sleek, Sexy -- And Brutally Honest",Curtis M.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c755a61e0000230070e64e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_736_noupscale,"On his new album, ‚ÄúUncontrolled,‚Äù Matt Doyle isn‚Äôt shy about pointing out a few of his battle scars, but he‚Äôs ultimately empowered by the loss of love, too.Nowhere is that more apparent than in ‚ÄúMoment,‚Äù the album‚Äôs rock-driven first single. Doyle said the song, which was released Feb. 19, was inspired by his struggle with severe depression last spring. The accompanying video has a much sexier vibe, and shows Doyle reconnecting with an ex-lover (played by Erik Altemus) in a New York hotel room for a woozy tryst.While Doyle has always been open about his sexuality, his latest work may surprise fans familiar with his roles in Broadway‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpring Awakening‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Book of Mormon,‚Äù which cultivated a squeaky-clean image. With ‚ÄúUncontrolled,‚Äù the New York-based actor-singer casts that boy-next-door image aside in favor of brutal honesty. Still, he hasn‚Äôt forgotten his cheeky sense of fun, as evidenced by the album‚Äôs promotional imagery, in which he shows off his chiseled physique.‚ÄúI have to be truthful and write music about my own experiences,‚Äù the 28-year-old told The Huffington Post in an interview. As for his decision to cast his pal Altemus in the video, he added, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily about standing on a soapbox and saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm gay,‚Äô but if I‚Äôm writing songs that are coming from an honest place in my life, I‚Äôm certainly not going to make a video with a woman [as a love interest].‚ÄùBoth the album and the video make it easy to see why collaborators like ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù co-director Tony Marion are quick to praise Doyle as ‚Äúone of the most generous creatives working in theater.‚Äù While Doyle has always maintained music as a side project to his theater work, ‚ÄúUncontrolled‚Äù is his first full-length album, and represents his most profound effort as a singer-songwriter to date. He began writing songs last year while starring in the Seattle production of the off-Broadway musical, ‚ÄúJasper in Deadland.‚Äù Although his show was playing to enthusiastic audiences, Doyle reveals that he was struggling behind the scenes.‚ÄúI felt very lonely, and there were a lot of things I just wasn‚Äôt doing for myself,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBroadway has been very good to me; theater has been very good to me. But the album was more about setting creative things up in my life outside of that, that I can do on my own.‚ÄùFollowing a massively successful Kickstarter campaign, Doyle was back in the studio last fall, collaborating with his longtime musical director, Will Van Dyke, as well as Nashville-based musicians Joel Heumann, Tina Parole and Jason Gantt. In many respects, ‚ÄúUncontrolled‚Äù picks up where his two previous EPs leave off, but boasts a polished veneer and feels more sonically cohesive. There are joyous moments on the 13-track pop-rock album, such as the ‚Äò50s-influenced ‚ÄúFall For Me,‚Äù and rousing covers of Sheryl Crow‚Äôs ‚ÄúIf It Makes You Happy‚Äù and Janis Joplin‚Äôs ‚ÄúMe and Bobby McGee,‚Äù which can be heard below. On a somber note, ‚ÄúWhen I Let You Go‚Äù is a standout ballad that recalls Doyle‚Äôs very public breakup with fellow Broadway performer, Ryan Steele. Still, writing a song about being a ‚Äújilted ex-boyfriend‚Äù wasn‚Äôt his intention. ‚ÄúI wish him nothing but the best,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I know that he feels the same way, too.‚ÄùFollowing the Feb. 26 release of ‚ÄúUncontrolled,‚Äù Doyle will celebrate the album with a special concert at New York‚Äôs Le Poisson Rouge three days later.

10,POLITICS,Americans' Views About The SCOTUS Nomination Debate Are All Over The Place. Here's Why.,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-obama-poll_us_56c75ebde4b041136f16d423,"So far, most people don't think the Supreme Court vacancy is a major issue for 2016.",2016-02-19,"The body of Justice Antonin Scalia arrives at the Supreme Court in Washington on Feb. 19, 2016. Americans are divided over who should pick his replacement.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Asked whether President Barack Obama should nominate a replacement for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Americans' views in four new surveys vary widely, showing that nuances of language matter just as much in polling as in tricky legal cases. While all questions about the issue are similar, they are worded just differently enough to elicit very different responses. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal and CBS News polls both asked respondents about their personal preferences for the next Supreme Court nominee -- and, unsurprisingly, the answers split evenly along party lines. The HuffPost/YouGov question, meanwhile, asked Americans what they thought Obama should do about the Supreme Court vacancy, giving respondents the option of choosing either ""nominate a replacement"" or ""let the next president nominate a replacement"" for their answer. Most chose the former option.And a Fox News poll found the most support for immediately filling the Supreme Court vacancy. This may be because once choice framed the nomination as a shared ""responsibility"" of current leaders, Obama and the Senate. Putting them on the same side, rather then casting them as rivals, likely defused some of the partisan tension inherent in the other polls.Despite the inconsistencies, the polling makes some things clear.One is the extent to which opinions rely on partisanship, rather than differing views on judicial precedent. In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, Democrats were eight times more likely than Republicans to express a high level of confidence in Obama's ability to choose a good nominee, a sentiment that translated into support for the president immediately nominating a replacement.Ninety-two percent of Americans who were very confident in Obama's ability to pick a nominee wanted him to nominate someone, compared to just 15 percent of those who said they weren't at all confident in Obama's choice.Democrats were 10 points more likely than Republicans to have a favorable view of the Supreme Court overall, although that's down from a 40-point gap in approval last summer after the court's decision to preserve a major part of the Affordable Care Act. Views on Scalia's legacy also split along decidedly partisan lines: 74 percent of Republicans, versus just 28 percent of Democrats, said they approved of his record as a justice.Yet for all the political division inherent in the current nomination debate, it might be a little overblown to suggest that the issue will play a central role in the 2016 elections.Americans theoretically consider the topic a serious one: 58 percent, including more than three-quarters of Republicans, said future appointments to the Supreme Court will be at least somewhat important to their vote in November.But that doesn't mean it's at the top of everyone's minds. Asked to choose the two election issues that mattered most to them, just 6 percent of respondents said they were focused on which party gets to nominate Supreme Court justices -- and the issue ranked dead last in a list of nine topics.That could change if the Supreme Court vacancy becomes a regular talking point on the campaign trail, but there's reason to suspect that its impact will remain limited.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 17-18 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling.

""This post was hurtful and destructive to our campus community. While social media can certainly bring about positive change, it can also be a place that deeply hurts and harms others.""The image she was referring to was posted on Snapchat and showed two students standing in a dorm wearing dark facial skincare treatments, which she interpreted as blackface. The students, however, say the post wasn't meant to be racist, it was just a picture of them wearing exfoliation masks.State Sen.

Kopper promised more forums so that school administrators will continue to hear from students, and said that a working group is in place to search for solutions to address racism on campus. ______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter covering higher education among other issues.

""It just occurred to me.""Trump, front-runner for the Republican nomination ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election, made the off-the-cuff comment at a town hall-style event at a country club, a day before the state's nominating contest.Even as he was still speaking, Trump's campaign posted on his Twitter handle (@real Donald Trump) from an iPhone, with the timestamp labeled ""via Twitter for iPhone."" Trump later posted on Twitter that he used both an iPhone and a Samsung device.In response, senior Apple executives, on a call with reporters on Friday, said they felt they were in good company given the other groups and people Trump has criticized in the past. They defended encryption as a way to protect Apple customers' rights.It was not the first attack on the world's best-known technology company by the real estate mogul and reality TV personality. Trump has previously been critical of Apple, which has its headquarters in Cupertino, California, for not producing enough of its products in the United States.""We're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries,"" Trump said in a January speech at Liberty University in Virginia.Apple is resisting U.S. government demands that it unlock an iPhone used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, shot and killed 14 people and wounded 22 others at a holiday party in San Bernardino last December.Trump made his comments as the U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion seeking to force Apple to comply with a judge's order for the company to unlock the phone, portraying the tech company's refusal as a ""marketing strategy.""The filing increased tension in a showdown between the Obama administration and Silicon Valley over security and privacy. The government has said the couple were sympathizers of Islamic State militants and wants to open the phone to find out more about possible connections and contacts.""If Apple doesn't give the information to the authorities on the radical Islamic terrorists, I'll only be using a Samsung - until such time as they give the information,"" Trump tweeted.""Hopefully others will follow suit. Our country needs and should demand security. It is time to get tough and be smart!""It was not the first time Trump has called for a boycott. In November, he lobbied for a Starbucks Corp boycott because the coffee chain's red holiday cups lacked Christmas-related decorations.He has repeatedly urged people not to shop at Macy's after the department store dropped his signature business clothing line because of comments he made about Mexicans.(Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu and Grant Smith Writing by Doina Chiacu and Ginger Gibson; Editing by Lisa Shumaker, Grant McCool and Bill Rigby)"

15,MEDIA,Trump's Latest Press Conference Earned Him A Ton Of Free Airtime,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-media-airtime_us_56c72d2ee4b0ec6725e2437e,Political ads cost a lot -- unless you've figured out a way not to have to run them.,2016-02-19,"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump speaks during a campaign stop in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, Feb. 15, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At a campaign stop in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, on Monday, Donald Trump quipped, ‚ÄúWho the hell wants to take out $2 million worth of commercials when I have enough cameras back there that can get the word around?‚Äù He might have had a point.By at least one reckoning, Trump received nearly $3 million worth of airtime from three major news networks on Monday alone, the day he held a widely covered press conference in Charleston, South Carolina.""Without question, Donald Trump‚Äôs single biggest contributors to his presidential aspirations are Fox News, CNN and MSNBC,"" states the report from 0ptimus, a data and analytics consulting firm based in Washington, D.C.Some major caveats should be noted here. 0ptimus -- that's a zero, not an ""O"" -- counts among its clients Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of Trump's competitors for the GOP presidential nomination, as well as the Republican National Committee, a group with which Trump has not always seen eye to eye.More to the point, while the 0ptimus report describes news coverage of Trump on Feb. 15, it doesn't include analogous data for any other candidates, whether Democratic or Republican. In other words, the report's findings about Trump really only apply to the events of Feb. 15. They can't be used as the basis for any kind of larger conclusions about the 2016 presidential race.The report examines the media coverage of Trump's Charleston press conference, both as it was happening and then throughout the rest of the day. CNN and MSNBC broadcast the entire 40-minute event live, while Fox News aired only the first half. ""We can get a good approximation for the value of this time by looking at what it would cost to have bought comparable airtime on the same channel,"" the report says.""For example, buying a 30-second ad spot on Fox News, nationwide, in the 2 p.m. ET time block would cost around $10,000,"" it continues. ""So if you wanted a minute of time, you‚Äôd have to pay $20,000. If a campaign wanted to buy 20 minutes of time (like Trump received during his press conference), the cost would be $400,000."" Using that logic, 0ptimus determined that the airtime given to Trump's presser as it was happening was worth a whopping $1.01 million.""To put this in perspective, the very largest of the SuperPACs supporting candidates in this primary are rarely spending $1M dollars a day, if at all,"" the report says.The report goes on to examine the three networks' follow-up coverage of Trump's press conference on the afternoon and evening of Feb. 15.""This post-coverage took many forms: Quick re-caps of the conference from reporters, soundbites from Trump‚Äôs major quotes, panel discussions of the conference,"" the report states. ""CNN even had Mr. Trump call-in live to discuss his 40-minute press conference."" Taken together, the report says, all this coverage adds up to ""the equivalent of $2.8M dollars in free tv media.""MSNBC had no comment on 0ptimus' report Friday. Fox News and CNN didn't respond to a request for comment. Again, since the report doesn't make any data-based comparisons between Trump and any other candidate, it can't be used to draw conclusions about the media's overall treatment of Trump. There just isn't enough context in 0ptimus's report to know whether or not these networks are giving him a significant advantage over the rest of the field. However, critics have long complained that the media showers disproportionate attention on the billionaire businessman.That, of course, is a mutually beneficial relationship. Trump's celebrity, his pugilistic style and his penchant for outrageous comments all make for good ratings and lots of clicks. Meanwhile, Trump gets the coverage he wants, and plenty of press accommodation to boot. And while his front-runner status in the Republican primary certainly makes him worthy of news coverage, the sheer amount of attention Trump receives might be unprecedented, if not unwarranted. A Huffington Post analysis in January, for example, found that when Trump did make a campaign ad, and bought airtime on New Hampshire TV stations ahead of that state's primary, the three major cable news channels went on to play the ad 60 times in a 24-hour period -- free of charge.Elizabeth Wilner, senior vice president at Kantar Media Intelligence, told HuffPost at the time that Trump had far outstripped his rivals in generating free media, and that she believed the value of his coverage to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.Another analysis by Media Matters found that in 2015, Trump personally appeared on Fox News 10 times in May and June -- more than any of the other Republican candidates -- for a total of 1 hour and 48 minutes of airtime. During his 40-minute press conference on Feb. 15, Trump lashed out at his chief rival for the nomination, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Trump, according to a report in The New York Times, called Cruz ""unstable"" and ""dishonest."" He then asked the media to help publicize these attacks against Cruz, saying that it would help him save money. ‚ÄúPsychologically,"" he said, ""I like to watch my costs.‚ÄùEditor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

If detected in large amounts, the industry would likely see an increased demand for stricter regulations.Glyphosate is widely used in farming, in conjunction with genetically engineered seeds that can withstand its toxic properties, and has been linked to various health and environmental concerns. Monsanto, which patented the herbicide in the 1970s, maintains it is effective and safe.The FDA and other regulatory agencies already test for pesticides, but glyphosate -- one of the most ubiquitous herbicides -- has never been on the FDA's list.Among the groups that welcomed the FDA announcement was the Center for Biological Diversity, which noted in a statement that glyphosate has been named as a leading cause of massive declines in monarch butterflies.Nathan Donley, a scientist with the group, said it was ""shocking"" it took the FDA so long to agree to testing. He added that he's ""glad it's finally going to happen.""‚ÄúMore and more scientists are raising concerns about the effects of glyphosate on human health and the environment,"" said Donley, adding that FDA data is ""badly needed to facilitate long-overdue conversations about how much of this chemical we should tolerate in our food.""Gary Ruskin, co-director of U.S. Right to Know, agreed testing is a ""good first step,"" but said it must be thorough and widespread. He encouraged the U.S. Department of Agriculture to join the effort. The FDA said a main reason it did not test for the herbicide in the past was because the available methods were ""very cost- and labor-intensive to implement in FDA field labs,"" according to a statement to Agri-Pulse.

If detected in large amounts, the industry would likely see an increased demand for stricter regulations.Glyphosate is widely used in farming, in conjunction with genetically engineered seeds that can withstand its toxic properties, and has been linked to various health and environmental concerns. Monsanto, which patented the herbicide in the 1970s, maintains it is effective and safe.The FDA and other regulatory agencies already test for pesticides, but glyphosate -- one of the most ubiquitous herbicides -- has never been on the FDA's list.Among the groups that welcomed the FDA announcement was the Center for Biological Diversity, which noted in a statement that glyphosate has been named as a leading cause of massive declines in monarch butterflies.Nathan Donley, a scientist with the group, said it was ""shocking"" it took the FDA so long to agree to testing. He added that he's ""glad it's finally going to happen.""‚ÄúMore and more scientists are raising concerns about the effects of glyphosate on human health and the environment,"" said Donley, adding that FDA data is ""badly needed to facilitate long-overdue conversations about how much of this chemical we should tolerate in our food.""Gary Ruskin, co-director of U.S. Right to Know, agreed testing is a ""good first step,"" but said it must be thorough and widespread. He encouraged the U.S. Department of Agriculture to join the effort. The FDA said a main reason it did not test for the herbicide in the past was because the available methods were ""very cost- and labor-intensive to implement in FDA field labs,"" according to a statement to Agri-Pulse.

23,BUSINESS,Having Safe Food Means Treating Restaurant Workers Better,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/food-safety-workers-rights_us_56c74039e4b041136f16b28b,"More employers are offering food workers better pay and benefits than perhaps ever before, but there's still a long way to go.",2016-02-19,"Saru Jayaraman has dedicated her career to pushing for restaurant workers' rights. Her new book <em>Forked</em> highlights employers who are setting a new standard, and those who are not.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c742b51500002b000b05c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Chipotle continues to reel from the food safety crisis that sickened hundreds of people and withered the fast-casual chain‚Äôs store sales and stock prices, one aspect of the company‚Äôs fall from glory has gone mostly overlooked.The cause of two of the company‚Äôs six outbreaks were norovirus and Chipotle blamed these outbreaks on workers coming to work despite being sick. The company is one of just a few in the restaurant industry to offer workers paid sick leave and has reiterated in its response to the outbreaks that employees should utilize their paid leave and stay home when they‚Äôre ill.That Chipotle‚Äôs policy was already in place at the time the outbreaks occurred, however, is part of a larger cultural problem in the industry. Only about 10 percent of restaurant workers have paid sick leave and 60 percent have reported coming to work sick, risking spreading a bug to both colleagues and customers, according to research from the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United.That‚Äôs the bad news, but there‚Äôs good news too. In Forked, a new book published this month, ROC United co-founder and co-director Saru Jayaraman draws on a wealth of research to spotlight not only which restaurants offer paltry wages and benefits to their employees, but also those employers -- both small and large -- that are doing the opposite.These restaurants, designated by Jayaraman as ""high road"" employers, are offering paid sick leave, fair wages and upward internal mobility. And by doing so, she argues, they‚Äôre thriving.Jayaraman recently spoke with The Huffington Post about the restaurant industry‚Äôs new normal.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Do you think readers of Forked will be surprised by the research you're uncovering, that so many employers are not offering their workers solid wages and benefits -- even in upscale restaurants?This is my third book and my second book, Behind the Kitchen Door, kind of exposed the conditions in the industry. I think a lot of people who are reading this book may have read that book, so it‚Äôs not so much the conditions that are surprising to people. I think what is new and surprising is that there is actually a different way of doing business and quite a few folks are following it and it‚Äôs very profitable to follow that alternative way of doing business. It‚Äôs what we call the high road.This misinformation has been spread for so long by the National Restaurant Association that it‚Äôs just not possible to provide good wages and benefits and still grow and thrive, that those kinds of policies will kill the industry. It‚Äôs the opposite of what so many fabulous employers are proving through their mere existence and growth. It has been accepted as a natural consequence that if you provide these wages and benefits, jobs will be lost, which is not true.You‚Äôve been working on these issues for some time now, but were there surprises for you as well as you researched this book?I have to say two things in particular. One, I did a lot of research on the origins of the tipped minimum wage. It has a lot to do not just with wages but paid sick leave. If you do not get a minimum wage from your employer, you have to rely on tips and and have to go to work regardless of your condition to get those tips. And that reliance on tips is the source of so many issues, from poverty to sexual harassment to health issues. That it originated in slavery was a total shock to me and something I didn‚Äôt know.And two, partly because of the book and partly because of our work over the last year, the high road path over the last year has become way more visible and more viable because of so many restaurateurs including Danny Meyer and Tom Colicchio talking to us over the last year and eliminating their tipped minimum wage. Chipotle talked with us and over the last year they‚Äôve made big changes based on those conversations. It‚Äôs partly because of the book and parallel to the book. I‚Äôm shocked because in the last 15 years of organizing I‚Äôve not seen so many instances where the high road has become so high-profile and visible and acceptable to restaurateurs throughout the country.Do you think Chipotle's issues are helping people connect the dots on why paid sick leave is so critical not solely to workers‚Äô health, but also the health of the customer and the business' success overall too?I think it‚Äôs totally eye-opening what‚Äôs happening to Chipotle. The chain restaurants that are a part of the NRA seem pretty dug into their positions on paid sick leave. I have not seen if it will have an impact on their willingness to adopt it, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. Consumers and legislators and policymakers are moved by what‚Äôs happening at Chipotle and it will force the NRA to move in this direction. For so long we were hearing from the NRA that it was not possible, but Chipotle taking this stance proves it is. It proves it‚Äôs necessary, essential and has a terrible impact when we don‚Äôt do it.Some media (including HuffPost) were cynical when Chipotle re-announced the paid leave policy this year as part of its food safety response. Is there reason to be skeptical that this is just a PR move?I would say that the motivation doesn‚Äôt matter to me, whether it‚Äôs publicity or real, as long as the workers actually get the days and feel empowered to take them. I do see that problem with Starbucks. They publicize so much how great they are to their employees but a lot of it is completely false, especially because a lot of their workers don‚Äôt work enough hours to quality for the benefits they claim to provide. I would say in hearing from a lot of workers at Chipotle that it‚Äôs a large company, but we do see a lot more satisfaction among workers in general at Chipotle compared to the other large chain restaurants.I‚Äôm still not completely happy with Chipotle‚Äôs pay rate, but as I think you read in our book, the high road is not a destination for us. We don‚Äôt expect every employer to be perfect and we don‚Äôt care why they do it as long as they do it, and doing it doesn‚Äôt mean they have to do it all at once. It‚Äôs about being on a road to the high road and continually striving to provide better benefits to workers.How do consumers factor into this? If the prevailing belief is that better wages and benefits will cost us more when we're eating out, do you think more people are willing to help pay for it?What I‚Äôm seeing is that most people just don‚Äôt know about most of these [lower wages and benefits] and I find the more that people know, the more they‚Äôre willing to engage on these issues. They‚Äôre pretty outraged by them and I do think they‚Äôre willing to pay more. But I think, again, it‚Äôs a fallacy promoted by the NRA that prices need to go way up to accommodate better benefits. In California, we have guaranteed sick days and much higher wages and the prices are definitely not higher here. I find myself spending more eating out when I travel than when I‚Äôm here in California.And we‚Äôve done a ton of research on this. It‚Äôs not just anecdotal. Menu prices are not actually higher in the seven states that have higher wages [for tipped workers] and the cities and states that offer guaranteed sick days. Even if there were menu pricing changes, I think consumers would be willing to pay for it, but I also think prices do not have to go up as much as the NRA would like you to believe.Are you feeling hopeful others will be following the lead of Chipotle and the other high road employers you outline in the book? If so, what is the biggest source of your optimism?Absolutely, I am feeling very, very optimistic about more and more states passing legislation that will raise both wages and provide benefits like paid sick days. This isn‚Äôt actually about moving every company to the high road restaurant by restaurant or company by company, it‚Äôs about getting policy passed that levels the playing field.Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

A masked man with a gun abducted 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling while riding his bike near his house.Jacob has been missing for 26 years but his parents, Patty and Jerry, have never given up hope -- they will find their son.Jacob would have turned 38 years old Feb. 17, as shown in the age progression photo below. To commemorate the date, the Wetterlings -- who still live in the same house where they raised their son -- have a tradition.""We always have a family dinner and we fix his favorite food, steak,"" Patty told ABC News. ""We laugh and hug our grandkids and we honor that. There were six us of in this family and we still carry Jacob in our hearts. It's just what we do.""Patty, who served on the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's board of directors for three years, also penned an emotional letter to her son this year and posted it on Jacob Wetterling Resource Center's website:HAPPY BIRTHDAY JACOB!  Birthdays are supposed to be about parties, hats and noisemakers, cake, ice cream, friends singing and making wishes but not yet. Not this year, again. How I wish to wrap my arms around you and hug you tight! I have watched the tape of your last birthday party over and over. We rented a suite at the Holiday Inn for your party. You and Aaron raced back and forth in the pool and took turns throwing each other in the deep end. It was so much fun!  I want you to know that since you were stolen away from us, people everywhere have been searching, praying and hoping for your safety and for answers. Last fall, 26 years later, news of possible answers had your story as the number two news coverage in the region. That's pretty amazing 26 years later. People care. There are more good people than bad in the world and people still hope.  My birthday wish is for you to come home. We need to find you. I have another wish for every child who is home safe today, that they will never have to endure abduction or sexual exploitation of any type. We are working just as hard on prevention as we are on searching because this is so wrong‚Ä¶so unfair. I remember how much it bothered you when things were unfair. Me too, it bothers me too.  I am hoping and praying that people will remember you on February 17 and we ask that everyone hug their kids a little tighter, tell them that they love them and take time to play a game or read books. My wish is also that parents will support agencies that help to find our missing kids and help other victims. Today, we ask everyone to volunteer, attend events, send financial support and share safety information. The non-profit work continues on a daily basis. Sometimes sexual exploitation and abduction are on the news, and sometimes not, yet we all rely on the support and expertise of these agencies when we need them. They are there for us. They need our support as well.  And once again today, February 17, we will light our candles, fix your favorite foods and cake, and thank God for the gift of you.  We love you Jacob and we'll never stop searching for you!  I so wish for a happy birthday for you‚Ä¶  MomJacob‚Äôs long-standing cold case got a huge break in November. Authorities in Minnesota named a person of interest -- Daniel James Heinrich, a 52-year-old who was arrested on charges of receipt and possession of child pornography.According to a feature written in People in 1989, Jacob, his brother, Trevor, 10, and a friend, Aaron Larson, 11, were coming home from a Tom Thumb convenience store and found a man in a mask waiting for them at the end of the Wetterlings‚Äôs dead-end street around 9 p.m on Oct. 22, 1989.""He told them to lie face down in the gutter,"" Jerry told People. ""Then he asked them their ages. He told Trevor to run into the field or he'd shoot. Then he had Aaron turn over, and he looked at his face and told him to run. He grabbed hold of Jacob.""Though the Wetterlings have experienced unfathomable emotional turmoil, the family is resolute in continuing their search.""We hope and pray that ‚Ä¶ we will have the answer to the one question we have asked forever: 'Where's Jacob?'"" the Patty told reporters gathered outside her St. Joseph Township home in November.

A plastic bag stapled to his medical chart held the grape-sized stones that were lodged in his upper body. With one eye now blind and the other damaged, he‚Äôs lucky to be alive.If the rocket had landed on his farm six months ago, Burhanuddin would have been able to seek emergency treatment for free at the 92-bed Doctors Without Borders trauma hospital in Kunduz, which highly trained Afghan and international medical staff ran.But ever since a U.S. attack in October destroyed the hospital -- the only trauma center like it in the country‚Äôs north -- Afghans like Burhanuddin now have to travel 200 miles to the Emergency Hospital in Kabul to receive life-saving treatment. The journey takes hours, sometimes days by car, much of it on a worn-out, snaking mountain route prone to avalanches and rockslides that passes through the Hindu Kush mountains.When patients enter Emergency, medical staff ask three questions: From where are you coming? What‚Äôs the injury? How long has it been?Often, as in the case of Burhanuddin, the answers are shocking.It took him two days to reach here. His wounds were so dire that both a local doctor and a government-run hospital in Kunduz sent him to Emergency instead, according to his uncle.‚ÄúPeople are coming from all over Afghanistan, with broken femurs and bullet wounds,‚Äù said Luca Radaelli, Emergency‚Äôs program coordinator, who estimates he‚Äôs seen some 14,000 injured patients in Afghanistan over the past eight years. ‚ÄúThis is crazy.‚ÄùThe Italian-run Emergency with 120 beds, an intensive care unit and two operating theaters, is now the only free, specialized trauma hospital of its kind treating war victims in Afghanistan. It has smaller hospitals and clinics across the country, but nothing like the one in Kabul, which serves as a referral point for Afghans with serious war-related injuries that require major surgery.Emergency staff say the number of patients coming from the north has increased exponentially since the Kunduz attack. Meanwhile, the country only seems to become more violent in the wake of U.S. troop withdrawal.‚ÄúThe situation was already bad,‚Äù Radaelli said. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs worsening day by day. ""There are very few [treatment] options for people. We‚Äôre here trying to do our best.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not just the high level of care and free access to treatment at Emergency that draws so many patients. It‚Äôs the questions Emergency medical staff don‚Äôt ask that really sets the trauma center apart from many public and government-run hospitals.Just like the former Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Emergency treats anyone wounded by war, regardless of their political or ideological affiliations. Civilians, Afghan soldiers, Taliban and other insurgents are treated as patients once they pass through the front door seeking help (and leave any weapons outside). No questions asked.It‚Äôs this neutrality that has made Emergency what it is today and why the Kunduz attack hit so close to home.‚ÄúKunduz was a cold shower,‚Äù Radaelli said. ‚ÄúWe never expected something like that. There‚Äôs no justification. It makes everyone really think. We don‚Äôt have an evacuation plan. Our policy is to stay. If there‚Äôs fighting, you‚Äôre supposed to stay.‚ÄùMuch has been debated about the highly controversial U.S. attack, which Doctors Without Borders -- also known as M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res -- labeled a potential war crime but the top U.S. general in Afghanistan called an unfortunate combination of human error and technical malfunctions.As has happened time and again in Afghanistan, lives have been taken in the fog of war. Those responsible have gotten away with murder, Afghans say.While the United States‚Äô combat role has officially ended in Afghanistan, with remaining American troops said to be focused on training, advising and assisting Afghan forces, the Kunduz attack has raised questions over America‚Äôs role -- particularly that of special forces -- in the country.It remains unclear whether or not the presence of wounded Taliban patients, and insistence by Afghan forces and officials that the extremists were using the hospital compound as a military staging ground, prompted the U.S. strikes. Taliban fighters had taken over much of the city, including the government-run hospital, as well as civilian homes and businesses, inflicting terror on those they deemed contrary to their hardline views.No armed Taliban gunmen were seen inside the hospital grounds at any time before or during the attack, according to a dozen MSF staff, surviving civilians, family members of patients and Kunduz residents that The WorldPost interviewed in Afghanistan.Burhanuddin was not one of the 42 MSF staff and patients who perished in the U.S. attack -- some of whom burned in their hospital beds or were gunned down while running for their lives. Nor was he one of the dozens of grieving family members or survivors left wounded afterwards, some of whom told The WorldPost they had received ‚Äúcondolence payments‚Äù of roughly $7,000 from the U.S. military. Yet, he felt the blow of the attack long after.The impoverished farmer‚Äôs lack of access to proper medical care is a direct result of an American attack aircraft striking a hospital protected under international law. Its coordinates were widely known by American and Afghan forces -- the trauma center was on a no-strike list.While the U.S. military has told The WorldPost that they‚Äôve made serious changes in the wake of the attack, including a review of their targeting process and retraining on rules of engagement, U.S. Central Command has yet to redact and publish a reportedly 3,000-page investigation into why it occurred.Basic facts, like how long the attack lasted -- the U.S. military says 29 minutes while MSF insists it lasted for an hour or more -- are still starkly at odds.Many wounded MSF staff and patients, were rushed to Emergency hospital in Kabul after the attack.Yousef, a nurse at Emergency who gave only his first name, said he‚Äôll never forget that day. There was something hauntingly unfair about treating medical staff, he recalled, who were attacked while they were trying to save lives.‚ÄúI cried,‚Äù he said as his colleagues treated a woman next to him who was injured in a Kabul suicide bombing. ‚ÄúIt was so difficult. They were helping poor people.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of my job,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIf we didn‚Äôt have this hospital, what would they do?‚ÄùDoctors Without Borders has said it will not rebuild and reopen the trauma center in Kunduz unless it gets answers and an ironclad promise that such an attack will never happen again.Until then, many Afghans wounded by landmines, rockets, bullets and the like have no choice but to make the long haul to the capital or settle for expensive, less-than-ideal medical care.‚ÄúI wish the MSF hospital was not bombed,‚Äù said Salim, Burhanuddin‚Äôs uncle who drove him to Kabul. ‚ÄúAll the patients of the neighboring provinces and Kunduz were treated there. I am really mourning.‚ÄùResponding to the U.S. destruction of MSF‚Äôs trauma center, Emergency printed their logo clearly on the hospital roof in Kabul, just for extra measure, and made sure the lights illuminated the logo so it would be clear to an attack aircraft. An aerial attack would be highly unlikely in the dense city center, and Radaelli said he hoped disaster wouldn‚Äôt strike twice.But the October strike on the MSF building changed everything.‚ÄúWe even built a bunker [at our hospital in Lashkar Gah] able to fit staff and patients,‚Äù Radaelli said. ‚ÄúAfter Kunduz, anything is possible.‚ÄùRadaelli was right. Anything is possible now, it seems. Just two weeks later, on Feb. 17, Afghan forces attacked a clinic south of Kabul run by the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan.According to one doctor working at the 10-bed clinic, some of the security forces were English speaking and seemed foreign. The U.S. military has so far denied involvement.Security forces reportedly handcuffed and beat medical staff, forcing two patients and a 15-year-old child out of the clinic. Then, they shot them to death.Naiemullah Sangen contributed reporting from Kabul."

If there‚Äôs fighting, you‚Äôre supposed to stay.‚ÄùMuch has been debated about the highly controversial U.S. attack, which Doctors Without Borders -- also known as M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res -- labeled a potential war crime but the top U.S. general in Afghanistan called an unfortunate combination of human error and technical malfunctions.As has happened time and again in Afghanistan, lives have been taken in the fog of war. Those responsible have gotten away with murder, Afghans say.While the United States‚Äô combat role has officially ended in Afghanistan, with remaining American troops said to be focused on training, advising and assisting Afghan forces, the Kunduz attack has raised questions over America‚Äôs role -- particularly that of special forces -- in the country.It remains unclear whether or not the presence of wounded Taliban patients, and insistence by Afghan forces and officials that the extremists were using the hospital compound as a military staging ground, prompted the U.S. strikes. Taliban fighters had taken over much of the city, including the government-run hospital, as well as civilian homes and businesses, inflicting terror on those they deemed contrary to their hardline views.No armed Taliban gunmen were seen inside the hospital grounds at any time before or during the attack, according to a dozen MSF staff, surviving civilians, family members of patients and Kunduz residents that The WorldPost interviewed in Afghanistan.Burhanuddin was not one of the 42 MSF staff and patients who perished in the U.S. attack -- some of whom burned in their hospital beds or were gunned down while running for their lives. Nor was he one of the dozens of grieving family members or survivors left wounded afterwards, some of whom told The WorldPost they had received ‚Äúcondolence payments‚Äù of roughly $7,000 from the U.S. military. Yet, he felt the blow of the attack long after.The impoverished farmer‚Äôs lack of access to proper medical care is a direct result of an American attack aircraft striking a hospital protected under international law. Its coordinates were widely known by American and Afghan forces -- the trauma center was on a no-strike list.While the U.S. military has told The WorldPost that they‚Äôve made serious changes in the wake of the attack, including a review of their targeting process and retraining on rules of engagement, U.S. Central Command has yet to redact and publish a reportedly 3,000-page investigation into why it occurred.Basic facts, like how long the attack lasted -- the U.S. military says 29 minutes while MSF insists it lasted for an hour or more -- are still starkly at odds.Many wounded MSF staff and patients, were rushed to Emergency hospital in Kabul after the attack.Yousef, a nurse at Emergency who gave only his first name, said he‚Äôll never forget that day. There was something hauntingly unfair about treating medical staff, he recalled, who were attacked while they were trying to save lives.‚ÄúI cried,‚Äù he said as his colleagues treated a woman next to him who was injured in a Kabul suicide bombing. ‚ÄúIt was so difficult. They were helping poor people.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of my job,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIf we didn‚Äôt have this hospital, what would they do?‚ÄùDoctors Without Borders has said it will not rebuild and reopen the trauma center in Kunduz unless it gets answers and an ironclad promise that such an attack will never happen again.Until then, many Afghans wounded by landmines, rockets, bullets and the like have no choice but to make the long haul to the capital or settle for expensive, less-than-ideal medical care.‚ÄúI wish the MSF hospital was not bombed,‚Äù said Salim, Burhanuddin‚Äôs uncle who drove him to Kabul. ‚ÄúAll the patients of the neighboring provinces and Kunduz were treated there. I am really mourning.‚ÄùResponding to the U.S. destruction of MSF‚Äôs trauma center, Emergency printed their logo clearly on the hospital roof in Kabul, just for extra measure, and made sure the lights illuminated the logo so it would be clear to an attack aircraft. An aerial attack would be highly unlikely in the dense city center, and Radaelli said he hoped disaster wouldn‚Äôt strike twice.But the October strike on the MSF building changed everything.‚ÄúWe even built a bunker [at our hospital in Lashkar Gah] able to fit staff and patients,‚Äù Radaelli said. ‚ÄúAfter Kunduz, anything is possible.‚ÄùRadaelli was right. Anything is possible now, it seems. Just two weeks later, on Feb. 17, Afghan forces attacked a clinic south of Kabul run by the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan.According to one doctor working at the 10-bed clinic, some of the security forces were English speaking and seemed foreign. The U.S. military has so far denied involvement.Security forces reportedly handcuffed and beat medical staff, forcing two patients and a 15-year-old child out of the clinic. Then, they shot them to death.Naiemullah Sangen contributed reporting from Kabul."

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) don't want to move forward on any Supreme Court nominee this year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_246_3515_1964%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Republicans have a new talking point for why they refuse to move forward on any Supreme Court nominee this year: They are doing it for the sake of the nominee. Since news broke of Justice Antonin Scalia's death Saturday, Republicans have lined up behind Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has promised not to even consider a nominee put forth by President Barack Obama. He wants to allow the next president to chose a candidate, hoping a Republican will win the White House.GOP senators have tried to point to historical precedent to back up their stance -- even though there's no evidence that presidents forgo nominating candidates in their final year.Now, recalcitrant Republicans are shifting their arguments and trying to convince Democrats that because the hearings are doomed to fail, making someone go through them would be unnecessarily cruel.""I think that hearing would end up very politicized. And I don't think it would be fair to the nominee,"" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said Wednesday during a CNN town hall event. ""It would be a denigration of that person's reputation not by Republicans -- I think more by Democrats than Republicans,"" added Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) during an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday.Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) made a similar argument to The Associated Press on Thursday, although his concern was over putting the American public through what would, he believed, be nothing more than a charade. ""[I]t might be just as well not to have a hearing that would, sort of, might mislead the American people into thinking that this is just about the qualifications of the candidate, because it's bigger than that,"" Toomey said. In other words, because the GOP is committed to trying to stop Obama from changing the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court in the wake of the conservative Scalia's death, the only outcome is one that would be personally damaging to the nominee. The credentials of the president's nominee are irrelevant, and will only be tarnished by Senate hearings. But in the days since McConnell first announced his intent to obstruct, GOP senators have been peeling away and indicating a willingness to vote or hold a hearing. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) initially echoed McConnell, but has since said he isn't ruling out holding a hearing on a nominee.Democrats have relished publicly shaming the GOP for their refusal to move.""I think my Republican counterpart McConnell has made a terrible mistake by saying that he is going to ignore the president. ... The president was re-elected for a four-year term, not a three-year term,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said during a town hall event Wednesday.During a press conference Tuesday, Obama reiterated that he absolutely intends to nominate a new justice and expects the Senate to consider that person on his or her merits.""We‚Äôve almost grown accustomed to a situation that is almost unprecedented -- where every nomination is contested, everything is blocked regardless of how qualified the person is, even when there‚Äôs no ideological objection to them, certainly where there‚Äôs no disqualifying actions by the nominee that have surfaced,"" Obama said. ""The fact that it's that hard, that we're even discussing this, is, I think, a measure of how, unfortunately, the venom and rancor in Washington has prevented us from getting basic work done.""The issue is already playing out in the 2016 elections. Democrats have a shot at taking back the Senate, and are betting that the GOP senators' reactions will turn off moderate and independent voters. Also on HuffPost:"

More than 70 percent of voters in each state think the main goal of the criminal justice system should be ‚Äúrehabilitating criminals to become productive, law-abiding citizens.‚Äù‚ÄúThe surveys from these six states are just an example of the growing momentum for criminal justice reform,‚Äù said Jason Pye, a spokesman for conservative advocacy group FreedomWorks. ‚ÄúOnce pervasive so-called tough on crime policies no longer have a grasp on the American public.‚ÄùThe survey was conducted by The Tarrance Group for the U.S. Action Justice Network, an advocacy group that partners with the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans for Tax Reform, FreedomWorks, the NAACP and other organizations that support criminal justice reform. The results show stark differences between Republicans and Democrats. In Florida, for example, 80 percent of Democrats think the U.S. jails too many nonviolent offenders, compared with 59 percent of Republicans. In Wisconsin, 82 percent of Democrats think the government is spending too much to keep nonviolent offenders behind bars, compared with 58 percent of Republicans.A recent Pew Charitable Trust poll appears to back up the new survey. Pew‚Äôs results, released earlier this month, found that 79 percent of U.S. voters want judges to be granted flexibility to determine sentences for drug offenses.The Tarrance Group survey in the six battleground states shows that voters, while polarized on candidates, are ‚Äúhighly engaged‚Äù and criminal justice reform is ‚Äúone of the few areas of common ground,‚Äù U.S. Justice Action Network said. ""Voters are not looking at this in a partisan standpoint,"" said Ed Goeas, president of The Tarrance Group. ""They are looking at it from the standpoint of common-sense solutions,"" The survey questioned over 3,000 voters during two weeks in January. In five of the six states, more than 60 percent of voters agree the federal government should remove barriers that make it harder for released prisoners to find jobs.U.S. Justice Action Network briefed GOP congressional staffers and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee on the poll on Wednesday, according to a group spokesperson. The appetite for passing criminal justice reform has steadily increased on Capitol Hill. Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Durbin‚Äôs (D-Ill.) bill is the favorite in the Senate to move this year. But a recent skirmish with conservatives in the Republican conference threatens its movement. Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) is the author of the companion bill in the House, which also boasts bipartisan support. Still, some House Democrats have concerns with Goodlatte‚Äôs Sentencing Reform Act of 2015. Authors of an alternative, dubbed the SAFE Justice Act, said they worry Goodlatte‚Äôs bill lacks substantive reform, and would make it difficult for Congress to return to the issue later.""Voters want to see action,"" said Holly Harris, executive director of the U.S. Justice Action Network. ""This poll reveals that -- in addition to being the smart thing to do from a policy standpoint -- criminal justice reform is a winning issue with voters, Democrats and Republicans alike.""Also on HuffPost:"

""He knows that our country is being ripped off big league, big league, on trade."" But Trump's praise for Sanders, the democratic socialist senator from Vermont, ended there.""The problem is, he can't do anything about it, he's not going to be able to do [anything], whereas I'm going to do things,"" Trump said. ""He doesn't understand what's happening. But he does know that China and these other countries are ripping us off."" Trump pointed to the high-profile layoffs at Carrier and Nabisco, where hundreds of jobs have been moved to Mexico.Trump's comment hits on a theme common to his and Sanders' campaigns: struggling workers' frustration with corporate America. Both candidates have spoken out against trade policies, and both are vocal critics of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.But Sanders blames corporate greed for policies he sees as destructive to workers in the U.S. and overseas, while Trump condemns foreigners and immigrants for taking American jobs. During the MSNBC town hall, Trump said he'd rather face former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the general election ""just because I'd love to beat Hillary.""

Trump and other presidential candidates have had little to say on food policy while campaigning.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c4b1701900002900377dae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In this age of oversharing, few moments of the 2016 presidential primary season haven't been documented in detail. We know Florida Sen. Marco Rubio likes electronic dance music overlaid with clean lyrics and that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is a fan of ""The Princess Bride."" We know how much campaigns have spent on pizza and fast food, and how presidential hopefuls feel about jalape√±o peppers and eggs. But amid all the chatter, the candidates have all but ignored food policy -- which advocacy groups point out encompasses such critical issues as hunger, healthy food access and farm subsidies. Chef and restaurateur Tom Colicchio is the co-founder of the D.C.-based nonprofit Food Policy Action. He summed up the importance of addressing food policy with one simple question: ""What affects us more than the food we eat and produce in this country?""""If you look at what‚Äôs driving this election, it‚Äôs immigration, it‚Äôs safety, it‚Äôs ISIS, it‚Äôs the big money going into campaigns,"" the popular ""Top Chef"" judge told The Huffington Post. ""That‚Äôs all well and good, but I would suggest our health care crisis because of the food we eat and how we‚Äôre marketing junk foods to kids will affect a lot more people in this country than ISIS will.""Colicchio‚Äôs group is one of three organizations behind Plate of the Union, an initiative launched in the fall with the aim of getting food policy matters on the radar of presidential hopefuls.Also joining the effort are ex-New York Times columnist Mark Bittman and food journalist Michael Pollan, who both helped co-author a manifesto calling for the next president to create a robust national policy to more effectively address their concerns about food in the U.S. The candidates haven't offered much of a response, but Colicchio argues that they aren‚Äôt solely to blame.""I‚Äôve heard almost nothing so far. But part of the problem is, I haven‚Äôt heard a journalist in a debate ask a question about food,"" Colicchio said. ""I know that Bernie Sanders has come out in favor of [genetically modified organism] labeling. I‚Äôve seen a few pictures of Hillary Clinton in farmers markets. That‚Äôs as close as we‚Äôre getting.""Indeed, Sanders supports national legislation mandating labels for food products containing GMOs. His campaign website includes a page focused on the rural economy. It champions ""family farms"" over ""factory farms"" and notes that the Vermont senator would ""enforce antitrust laws against large agribusiness and food corporations"" if elected.Sanders‚Äô Democratic opponent, Clinton, has a factsheet on rural issues that includes a plan to support ""the next generation of farmers"" and increase funding for farmers market and local food promotion programs to help build ""a strong local and regional food system.""It‚Äôs trickier to determine the Republican candidates‚Äô positions on food policy.Only Rubio touches on any related issues on a campaign website. His page highlights farming issues, and he vows to repeal the ""burdensome regulations"" he says the Environmental Protection Agency has imposed on farmers and ranchers. He doesn't address topics like GMOs or increasing access to healthy food.Republican front-runner Donald Trump has barely addressed food policy, according to Agri-Pulse, a farm, food and rural policy-focused news site that has analyzed the relevant stances of leading candidates from both parties. The site points out that Trump has posted a few tweets mentioning related topics but the he hasn't addressed them head-on. Cruz has opposed GMO labeling, and dismissed the 2014 farm bill due to the ""massive"" cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, but hasn't expanded much on either topic, Agri-Pulse notes.As for the other three candidates, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has called for eliminating the SNAP program as part of a broad welfare overhaul plan. Ohio Gov. John Kasich has been criticized for supporting a work requirement for SNAP recipients in his state. And Ben Carson said, ""I actually like for people to know what they're buying"" when asked about a federal GMO labeling law during a town hall event last year.Beyond that, information is difficult to come by. Another food-focused nonprofit, Food Tank, is working to change that.Last week, the group issued a 10-point list of food policy questions they would like to see the presidential candidates address. Among them are questions concerning government support for organic farming, labeling of products containing GMOs and the fate of the childhood nutrition-focused Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.""These are questions people want to know the answers to,"" Food Tank President Danielle Nierenberg said. ""These are questions a lot of people are thinking about. The urgency of these issues is so great.""Her group is working with other food organizations to connect with the campaigns and get answers during this and any other election season. ""I don‚Äôt think this is going to go away,"" Nierenberg said. ""Four years from now, we‚Äôll be pressing candidates on some of these same questions and some different ones I‚Äôm sure will arise between now and then. I think the candidates will really have to become more knowledgable about food.""HuffPost also wants to hear from the candidates, and will send questions about food policy to their campaigns.

41,POLITICS,"We Know What Candidates Have Spent On Pizza, But Not Where They Stand On Hunger",Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/presidential-candidates-hunger-food-policy_us_56c4b0c6e4b08ffac1273952,"Or food assistance, or farm subsidies, or GMO labeling, or... ‚Äã",2016-02-18,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton talks with a vendor during a visit to a farmers market in Davenport, Iowa.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In this age of oversharing, few moments of the 2016 presidential primary season haven't been documented in detail. We know Florida Sen. Marco Rubio likes electronic dance music overlaid with clean lyrics and that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is a fan of ""The Princess Bride."" We know how much campaigns have spent on pizza and fast food, and how presidential hopefuls feel about jalape√±o peppers and eggs. But amid all the chatter, the candidates have all but ignored food policy -- which advocacy groups point out encompasses such critical issues as hunger, healthy food access and farm subsidies. Chef and restaurateur Tom Colicchio is the co-founder of the D.C.-based nonprofit Food Policy Action. He summed up the importance of addressing food policy with one simple question: ""What affects us more than the food we eat and produce in this country?""""If you look at what‚Äôs driving this election, it‚Äôs immigration, it‚Äôs safety, it‚Äôs ISIS, it‚Äôs the big money going into campaigns,"" the popular ""Top Chef"" judge told The Huffington Post. ""That‚Äôs all well and good, but I would suggest our health care crisis because of the food we eat and how we‚Äôre marketing junk foods to kids will affect a lot more people in this country than ISIS will.""Colicchio‚Äôs group is one of three organizations behind Plate of the Union, an initiative launched in the fall with the aim of getting food policy matters on the radar of presidential hopefuls.Also joining the effort are ex-New York Times columnist Mark Bittman and food journalist Michael Pollan, who both helped co-author a manifesto calling for the next president to create a robust national policy to more effectively address their concerns about food in the U.S. The candidates haven't offered much of a response, but Colicchio argues that they aren‚Äôt solely to blame.""I‚Äôve heard almost nothing so far. But part of the problem is, I haven‚Äôt heard a journalist in a debate ask a question about food,"" Colicchio said. ""I know that Bernie Sanders has come out in favor of [genetically modified organism] labeling. I‚Äôve seen a few pictures of Hillary Clinton in farmers markets. That‚Äôs as close as we‚Äôre getting.""Indeed, Sanders supports national legislation mandating labels for food products containing GMOs. His campaign website includes a page focused on the rural economy. It champions ""family farms"" over ""factory farms"" and notes that the Vermont senator would ""enforce antitrust laws against large agribusiness and food corporations"" if elected.Sanders‚Äô Democratic opponent, Clinton, has a factsheet on rural issues that includes a plan to support ""the next generation of farmers"" and increase funding for farmers market and local food promotion programs to help build ""a strong local and regional food system.""It‚Äôs trickier to determine the Republican candidates‚Äô positions on food policy.Only Rubio touches on any related issues on a campaign website. His page highlights farming issues, and he vows to repeal the ""burdensome regulations"" he says the Environmental Protection Agency has imposed on farmers and ranchers. He doesn't address topics like GMOs or increasing access to healthy food.Republican front-runner Donald Trump has barely addressed food policy, according to Agri-Pulse, a farm, food and rural policy-focused news site that has analyzed the relevant stances of leading candidates from both parties. The site points out that Trump has posted a few tweets mentioning related topics but the he hasn't addressed them head-on. Cruz has opposed GMO labeling, and dismissed the 2014 farm bill due to the ""massive"" cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, but hasn't expanded much on either topic, Agri-Pulse notes.As for the other three candidates, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has called for eliminating the SNAP program as part of a broad welfare overhaul plan. Ohio Gov. John Kasich has been criticized for supporting a work requirement for SNAP recipients in his state. And Ben Carson said, ""I actually like for people to know what they're buying"" when asked about a federal GMO labeling law during a town hall event last year.Beyond that, information is difficult to come by. Another food-focused nonprofit, Food Tank, is working to change that.Last week, the group issued a 10-point list of food policy questions they would like to see the presidential candidates address. Among them are questions concerning government support for organic farming, labeling of products containing GMOs and the fate of the childhood nutrition-focused Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.""These are questions people want to know the answers to,"" Food Tank President Danielle Nierenberg said. ""These are questions a lot of people are thinking about. The urgency of these issues is so great.""Her group is working with other food organizations to connect with the campaigns and get answers during this and any other election season. ""I don‚Äôt think this is going to go away,"" Nierenberg said. ""Four years from now, we‚Äôll be pressing candidates on some of these same questions and some different ones I‚Äôm sure will arise between now and then. I think the candidates will really have to become more knowledgable about food.""HuffPost also wants to hear from the candidates, and will send questions about food policy to their campaigns.

But she said the president still has an important responsibility to fulfill.""You just have to pick the best person you can under the circumstances, as the appointing authority must do,"" she said. ""It's an important position and one that we care about as a nation and as a people. And I wish the president well as he makes choices and goes down that line. It's hard.""Reagan, fulfilling a campaign promise to nominate a woman to the high court, appointed O'Connor in 1981. For 25 years, she played a mostly centrist, pragmatist role on the bench -- often breaking from Republican ideology and siding with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on women's issues.She stepped down in 2006 to care for her ailing husband and was replaced by Justice Samuel Alito. Many legal observers have noted that, had she not retired when she did, the court wouldn't have shifted rightward so dramatically in the last decade.A Baltimore Sun op-ed piece published Tuesday argued that Obama should bring O'Connor out of retirement and put her back on the court.Watch the interview with O'Connor below:"

""Jesus told us to help the poor, but he never said vote for somebody who is going to take money from your neighbor and give it to the poor. Jesus never told us whether to vote for a socialist or a capitalist. He told us to render unto Caesar, use our own brains to decide who would be the best political leader.""Falwell, who currently serves as president of Liberty University, the world's largest Christian institution of higher learning, made his comments while defending billionaire businessman and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, whom Falwell has endorsed. The pope had earlier suggested that Trump was ""not Christian"" because of his proposal to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.In response, Trump said it was ""disgraceful"" for the pope to question his faith. Falwell agreed. And while he said he believes Trump is indeed Christian, Falwell argued that questions of a candidate's faith shouldn't play into the political process.""It's not our job to choose the best Sunday school teacher, like Jimmy Carter was,"" Falwell said. ""It's our job to choose ... who would defend and protect our nation, who would be the best president. Who would lead us away from $20 trillion in debt and restore the country's economic viability.""The principle of separating religious life from civic life is rooted in both the Bible and the U.S. Constitution. But evangelicals have challenged this tenet over the past few decades, thanks in large part to the efforts of Falwell's father, Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr., who founded the Moral Majority and succeeded in bringing generations of evangelical Christians into the political fold. Fundamentalist Christian teachings now affect politics at all levels, and in doing so, have changed the face of American Christianity and the GOP.The notion that Jesus would have disapproved of this seems to have resonated with Falwell only recently, when he's tried to explain his support for Trump, a thrice-married casino developer, as a ""personal"" endorsement, separate from his high-profile positions as a leader within the evangelical movement and university president. But the very idea that he could separate his politics from his faith seems to contradict the cornerstone of what has made the evangelical movement a political powerhouse in America.‚ÄúI really believe that anybody on the left or the right that tries to invoke the teachings of Jesus to say they should vote for this candidate or that candidate, I think they‚Äôre stretching Scripture,‚Äù he said in a recent interview with The New York Times.Despite his outsized influence in evangelical circles, Falwell is not a minister or the leader of a church. If he were, then making a political endorsement could threaten the 501(c)3 tax status of his church. Falwell has stressed that his endorsement is not the official position of Liberty University. But to evangelical political activists, the difference is a semantic one.Other evangelical leaders, like Robert Jeffress of the Texas megachurch First Baptist Dallas, have stopped just short of endorsing Trump to protect their tax exemption. Appearing with Trump in Iowa earlier this year, Jeffress all but endorsed Trump with a remark that could have been confusing to the followers who look to him for spiritual and political guidance: ‚ÄúAlthough as a pastor I cannot officially endorse a candidate,"" he said, ""[I'm] absolutely convinced that Donald Trump would make a great president of the United States.""Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

But is he real-deal enough to stop Trump?",2016-02-18,"Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) stands with Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) during a town hall Thursday in Greenville, South Carolina.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_126_193_4650_2939%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"ANDERSON, S.C. -- If you think the way Republican party strategists do, then you would have loved the scene here at the Hilton Garden Inn ballroom Thursday afternoon, two days before the GOP holds its crucial presidential primary in South Carolina.It was a polite, well-dressed crowd: comfortable upstate businesspeople and students from nearby Clemson University. It was the kind of crowd that turned out for -- and voted for -- two generations of Bush family members in years past.On a stage-in-the-round in a room packed with about 500 people, there stood Sen. Marco Rubio, 44 years old and a son of Cuban immigrants, backed by a trio of top (and very popular) GOP state politicians who had endorsed him: well-coiffed Rep. Trey Gowdy of Benghazi committee fame; Tim Scott, an arch conservative who is one of two African-American members of the U.S. Senate; and, as of Wednesday and introduced last on Thursday, the state‚Äôs governor, 44-year-old Nikki Haley, the daughter of Indian Sikh immigrants from Punjab.‚ÄúHere comes the cavalry with her endorsement!‚Äù said Scott as he brought the governor on stage to greet Rubio and the rest.This was the first last stand of the GOP establishment, and of traditional ways of doing business in the Republican Party: people making endorsements, people fashioning diverse and demographically shrewd ‚Äútickets‚Äù to ride.The Washington and Congress-based establishment, such as it is these days, loathes Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and his Savonarola-like, holier-than-thou approach to politics, not to mention his oleaginous personality and the cheek he showed when he called GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar.They are apoplectic and -- worse from their point of view -- utterly confused by Donald Trump, who violates every known rule of politics and is the front-runner as a result.‚ÄúHe has the fewest advisers, makes what by traditional standards are the worst political moves, says whatever comes into his mind whenever he wants to -- and it all works,‚Äù said GOP poll-taker Frank Luntz, who had an anti-establishment past of his own (he was Pat Buchanan‚Äôs poll guy in 1992) before he became a certified insider and pundit.‚ÄúWhy is he not hurt -- in fact, in first place?"" Luntz asked rhetorically. ‚ÄúBecause voters think he is real, that he is honest, and that he is not part of any of the regular way of doing things.‚ÄùAs if to prove Luntz‚Äôs point, Trump managed to get into a war of words on Thursday with Pope Francis, who suggested that the billionaire wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù -- a move Trump called a ‚Äúdisgrace.‚ÄùThe insiders' problem is that the rules they wrote for the 2016 nomination may, ironically, now favor Trump. South Carolina is an open primary -- Democrats can vote, and Trump may get some to do so -- and it is winner-take-all by congressional district. In other words, Trump doesn‚Äôt need a majority to win all the delegates, he just has to finish first.That method, and other rules about how delegates are allocated, give the front-runner the advantage in all of the upcoming events. If Cruz and Rubio keep carving each other up -- and if Ben Carson, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush stay in the race after South Carolina -- Trump could be hard to catch as primaries allow him to pile up a big lead.Hating Cruz and fearing Trump, the insiders more than ever are behind Rubio. They include most of the usual suspects: corporate lobby and fundraising types; defense contractors and war hawks; members of Congress (many have endorsed him, while not a single senator has endorsed Cruz); and elected officials of all levels in various states.Most of that doesn‚Äôt matter in primaries and caucuses, where voters have all the say.The Haley endorsement may be a little different, especially since the Bush family, including two former presidents, had all but begged her to endorse family scion Bush.The other reason is that she impressed the entire country with healing words and actions after the deadly attack on a black church in Charleston last year. In local eyes, Haley helped the state -- which has aggressively and successfully marketed itself internationally as a good place for business -- save or at least prevent the ruination of its new image.No wonder that when Rubio finally spoke to the crowd after the introductions, Haley stood silently at his side for his entire speech.Unspooling his flowing, upbeat and extremely anodyne stump speech, Rubio tied his own family‚Äôs immigrant story to that of Haley and to the story of the country; talked of the GOP‚Äôs evident need to expand its reach (‚Äúthis is what the future of conservatism looks like,‚Äù he said, referring to his endorsers); vowed that America‚Äôs best days remain ahead; and recited his conservative bona fides on matters such as abortion, gun rights, limited government, lower taxes, higher defense spending and an aggressive military stance.The key lines: ‚ÄúI am as conservative as anyone in this race,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I am a conservative who can win‚Äù in the general election.The crowd warmed to his earnest-sounding themes but saved their loudest applause -- and a standing ovation -- for an attack on Hillary Clinton's handling of the Benghazi episode.Afterward a Clemson student who was undecided when she came was still not convinced. ""I want to look at Ben Carson again,"" she said.If Rubio can‚Äôt finish strongly here -- pulling off an upset win or a close second -- he and his backers are going to have to make another last stand, until they run out of places to make them.‚ÄúRubio‚Äôs message is right in the center of the conservative vote,‚Äù said Luntz, interviewed outside the hall after the event. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see what he can do with it.‚ÄùCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described Tim Scott as the only African-American member of the U.S. Senate.Also on HuffPost:"
