For centuries, this small piece of land has been sacred to several spiritual groups including the Romans, Christians, Muslims and Jews. Staring out at the landscape, I saw the legacies of rulers and religions throughout the centuries.

Our guide drove us to the Gate of Zion, and we walked through halls where miracles supposedly took place, inspiring everything from wars to works of art.

Today, just about every household in America consumes hummus, whether made at home or store-bought. Of course, it's no surprise that the famous dip has become so popular: it's super delicious, incredibly healthy and easy to make.What I love the most about hummus, aside from its signature flavor, is its texture: so deliciously smooth... And this version of hummus, made with ripe avocados, is the creamiest hummus ever!As a last touch, the hummus is drizzled with a deliciously fruity avocado oil. So here's to hummus... in all its forms.Avocado Hummus with Toasted Coriander and Avocado Oilmakes 2 cups or serves 4 active time: 15 minFor the coriander1 teaspoon coriander seedsFor the hummus1 cup cooked chickpeas - drained 2 tablespoons Tahini 3 tablespoons lime juice 1 tablespoon avocado oil (or extra virgin olive oil) 1 garlic clove -- skinned and halved 3/4 teaspoon sea salt 1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne 1/4 cup reserved cooking water from the chickpeas or spring water 2 ripe avocados 1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantroavocado oil (or extra virgin olive oil) for drizzlingStep 1: Heat a small heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the coriander seeds and cook until they turn a darker shade and are fragrant -- about 2 minutes -- shaking the pan continuously and taking care not to burn them. Transfer to a mortar, let cool and then finely grind. Set aside.Step 2: To make the hummus -- Place all the ingredients, except the avocados, in the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping the sides of the bowl once. Cut the avocados in half, remove the pit and spoon the flesh into the food processor. Continue processing until the avocados are well incorporated and the mixture is very smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a serving dish. Drizzle with a little avocado oil and sprinkle with the ground coriander and the cilantro. Serve with warm pitas and/or crudités.Cook's note: The hummus can be refrigerated for up to 2 days only, after which the avocados will start to oxidize and turn brown.* * *Now... how about this creamy cannellini bean dip with pan-fried mint? It is so delicious!"

My new series, Critical Listing, airing on HGTV starting on March 17, comes to the rescue with handpicked projects and ideas that help you sell your home for the best value.

Our goal is to show homeowner projects that will have the biggest impact on their potential buyer. Below are a few tips from Jo and I to help you prioritize what projects to tackle -- from the inside-out -- or is it from the outside-in?!Jo: 3 tips to transform your home.• Kitchen and bathrooms sell. Studies show buyers are most interested in, and most critical of, kitchens and bathrooms. If you have some money to put into your home, spend it here. Even if you can't afford a big renovation, think of smaller projects with a big impact. Add a coat of paint on the walls or cabinet doors. Change your hardware or countertops. Simple projects can transform a space.BeforeAfter• De-clutter! Everybody says this because it works. Eliminate clutter from counter tops, dressers and hutches. Take away those extra furniture pieces collecting dust and remove cluttered walls of family photos. Remember you are selling a house, not a home. You want your space to feel neutral so potential buyers can see the house, not the stuff in it.• A little paint goes a long way. A fresh coat of paint makes your house sparkle and hides your family's wear and tear. Semi-gloss white paint on all your trim and doors, paired with a light, on-trend colour on the walls can spruce up any home. And don't forget your ceilings. These projects show potential buyers you have been taking care of your home!Carson: 3 tips to spruce up your outdoor space.• Curb Appeal. Never underestimate the value of a good first impression. We now know that the outside of your home makes a seven percent difference in perceived home value. Homes that have well maintained front yards with good character are in high demand. Keep it simple, planters at the front door allow you to add colour and personality without going over-the-top.BeforeAfter• Light up the night! Most potential buyers will drive past a listing after work; not willing to wait until a weekend open house if they are really interested in a property. Add some simple solar spotlights to highlight the best features of your house. Don't go overboard, less is more in this case. Use one light for each side of the front of the house, and a third to shine on the for-sale sign. • Stage the backyard. We've all seen a beautifully staged home and most of us understand the value of creating an inspirational space. The same is true for the backyard. Make sure that you pay as much attention to the deck or patio as you do the living room. Create spaces for outdoor living.
