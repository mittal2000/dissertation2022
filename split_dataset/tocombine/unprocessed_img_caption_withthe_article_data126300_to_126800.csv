Today, just about every household in America consumes hummus, whether made at home or store-bought. Of course, it's no surprise that the famous dip has become so popular: it's super delicious, incredibly healthy and easy to make.What I love the most about hummus, aside from its signature flavor, is its texture: so deliciously smooth... And this version of hummus, made with ripe avocados, is the creamiest hummus ever!As a last touch, the hummus is drizzled with a deliciously fruity avocado oil. So here's to hummus... in all its forms.Avocado Hummus with Toasted Coriander and Avocado Oilmakes 2 cups or serves 4 active time: 15 minFor the coriander1 teaspoon coriander seedsFor the hummus1 cup cooked chickpeas - drained 2 tablespoons Tahini 3 tablespoons lime juice 1 tablespoon avocado oil (or extra virgin olive oil) 1 garlic clove -- skinned and halved 3/4 teaspoon sea salt 1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne 1/4 cup reserved cooking water from the chickpeas or spring water 2 ripe avocados 1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantroavocado oil (or extra virgin olive oil) for drizzlingStep 1: Heat a small heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the coriander seeds and cook until they turn a darker shade and are fragrant -- about 2 minutes -- shaking the pan continuously and taking care not to burn them. Transfer to a mortar, let cool and then finely grind. Set aside.Step 2: To make the hummus -- Place all the ingredients, except the avocados, in the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping the sides of the bowl once. Cut the avocados in half, remove the pit and spoon the flesh into the food processor. Continue processing until the avocados are well incorporated and the mixture is very smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a serving dish. Drizzle with a little avocado oil and sprinkle with the ground coriander and the cilantro. Serve with warm pitas and/or crudit√©s.Cook's note: The hummus can be refrigerated for up to 2 days only, after which the avocados will start to oxidize and turn brown.* * *Now... how about this creamy cannellini bean dip with pan-fried mint? It is so delicious!"
