Marco Rubio, R-Fla. pauses while speaking during a technology roundtable at the Switch Innovation Center, Friday, May 29, 2015, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fec62200004301dd86ec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you want to understand the temperaments and governing philosophies of the Republican presidential candidates, pay close attention to the way they talk about an iconic moment of President Barack Obama’s tenure: His decision, in the spring of 2009, to rescue Chrysler and General Motors.  Most of the top GOP contenders have said the decision was a mistake. The latest to do so was Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, who boasted Friday during MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that he was against all bailouts -- including the one for General Motors. “When corporate leaders make bad mistakes, they need to be held accountable, whether they are on Wall Street or on Main Street,” Perry said.Perry and the other Republicans critical of the auto industry rescue might sincerely believe it was the wrong policy. Or they might simply fear the wrath of Republican primary voters who can’t stomach support for an initiative that came from Obama. Whatever their motives, Republicans who say they would not have extended the same lifeline that Obama did need to reckon with a key fact:By nearly all accounts, the 2009 rescue package saved a vital U.S. industry and, just maybe, the economic fortunes for an entire region.FROM GENERAL MOTORS TO GOVERNMENT MOTORSSix years after the fact, it’s easy to forget the dire plight that Chrysler and General Motors faced at the time. Decades of poor decision-making by management and labor had saddled the firms with manufacturing capacity they couldn’t use, wage and benefit obligations they couldn’t meet, and, yes, cars they couldn’t sell. Unlike Ford, which had confronted and addressed similar problems while it still had time to save itself, Chrysler and GM had postponed their reckoning until late 2008 -- the very same time that the collapse of the financial and housing markets had thrown the economy into a deep recession.  They came to Washington for help and the Bush administration obliged with an emergency, short-term loan eventually worth about $23 billion -- enough to last until the spring, when the newly elected Obama could make up his own mind about what to do. (Before Obama took office, his advisers had quietly urged Bush to keep the companies going, according to a memoir subsequently written by former White House adviser David Axelrod.) With full control over the situation, and following intense debate among his aides, Obama decided to offer the car companies a deal. The government would infuse Chrysler and GM with federal dollars, but it would also take control of them -- steering the firms into bankruptcy and then managing a massive restructuring of operations so that they could become profitable once again.  To justify such extraordinary measures, Obama cited the extraordinary circumstances: At a time of economic crisis, the president explained, the collapse of Chrysler and GM would likely have severe repercussions, wrecking not just two iconic American companies but also the myriad businesses -- from parts suppliers to mom-and-pop restaurants near factories -- that depended on the two companies. The damage could even drag down Ford, Obama warned, despite that company’s relative health.  Obama’s arguments did not go over particularly well with the public, which was angry over bailouts of banks and the apparent insolence of the auto executives, who flew to Washington on private jets in order to make their appeals. But the decision to save Chrysler and GM most infuriated Republicans and their allies, who thought the federal government had no business meddling in the economy or taking over private corporations -- even, or especially, for the sake of saving firms that couldn’t survive on their own. “Every dollar spent with GM is a dollar spent against free enterprise,” Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio host, said at the time. Eric Cantor, then a Republican leader in the House, predicted “they’ll run it into the ground.”  Infographic by Alissa SchellerIn the end, pretty much the opposite happened. Employment in the auto industry, which had been on a steady and then steep decline since 2005, hit rock bottom in June 2009 -- the same month GM declared bankruptcy and, under Obama administration supervision, started restructuring its operations. The ensuing transformation included plenty of pain, from shuttered factories to bondholders who lost money to an agreement, with the unions, that new workers would make less money than the old ones. But the companies emerged from bankruptcy stronger -- in Chrysler’s case, after a sale to Fiat -- and they’ve been growing ever since. Jobs in automobile manufacturing began rising the very month that GM started its bankruptcy reorganization. Today, employment in the sector is back to where it was before the recession, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate in Michigan and other states with large numbers of auto industry jobs began a similarly dramatic improvement around the time of the two bankruptcies. Today, Michigan’s unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been since 2001.And while the companies still face problems, which for GM include the legacy of massive vehicle recalls and a business model heavily reliant on large vehicles, most analysts think they are on solid footing again.The auto industry rescue isn’t the only reason that employment in the automobile sector and the Great Lakes states has rebounded. The economy a whole has grown since that time, albeit with some stalls, and that’s included a rebound in all manufacturing jobs, not just those in the automobile industry. But the reverse is probably true, as well. Without growth from GM and Chrysler, the recovery in manufacturing specifically and the economy overall might have been weaker. How much weaker? A report from the Center for Automotive Research, which is based in Michigan and receives some funding from the auto industry, suggested that the rescue of GM and Chrysler saved as many as 2.6 million jobs in 2009. Car-making would have eventually migrated elsewhere, the research center found, including to other countries. Parts of the Midwest would have been devastated.FROM ROMNEY TO RUBIOThe rescue’s success, particularly in politically contested states of Michigan and Ohio, was a topic that Obama raised at every opportunity during the 2012 campaign. His opponent, Mitt Romney, struggled to find a position, offering slightly different responses generally depending on when and to whom he was speaking. A Michigander by birth and son to a former auto industry executive who later became governor, Romney eventually settled on the argument that the problem wasn’t with the carmakers or their workers -- it was with Obama’s decision to put taxpayer dollars at risk. Four years later, many of Romney’s would-be successors as Republican presidential nominee have adopted more or less the same posture -- opposing the rescue on principle, though making an effort to say they are glad the industry survived. Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida, told a New Hampshire audience a few weeks ago, “I don’t think that was the right way to handle it,” and called Obama’s approach “problematic.” (Rubio had also predicted that the federal government would never relinquish control of the companies. The government sold back its last shares in 2013.) Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, has said on several occasions he opposes the bailout -- at one point calling it a “form of capitalism when the government intervenes in a very muscular kind of way. And I don’t believe that is appropriate.” During a campaign stop in Michigan this week, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said Obama’s rescue was simply unnecessary. “I don’t think the federal government should be engaged in bailouts,” Cruz told a local audience. “Those industries would have [survived] and thrived.”But few experts believe that today. Companies can’t emerge from bankruptcy if they can’t get financing to operate while they are reorganizing. And, when Chrysler and GM were in trouble, the banks were in no position to provide that kind of money. Steve Rattner, the Wall Street executive was lead adviser to Obama's automobile rescue team, later explained that relying on private sector loans ""sounds like a wonderfully sensible approach -- except that it’s utter fantasy. In late 2008 and early 2009, when GM and Chrysler had exhausted their liquidity, every scrap of private capital had fled to the sidelines. I know this because the administration’s auto task force, for which I was the lead adviser, spoke diligently to all conceivable providers of funds, and not one had the slightest interest in financing those companies on any terms."" At one point in 2009, according to a separate report in The New York Times, Obama administration officials approached the partners at Bain Capital -- Romney's old firm -- to see if they could supply some of the money. They said no, which meant the government was likely the only financier available. And while taxpayers ultimately lost $9 billion on the transaction, according to the Treasury Department, it was a fraction of the total $80 billion loan and almost certainly far less than the government would have spent on assistance to help all of the workers a liquidation of Chrysler and GM would have displaced. In the end, even the editors of The Economist -- staunch free-market champions who had opposed the rescue at the time admitted they owed Obama an “apology” because “the doomsayers were wrong.”WALKER DODGES THE QUESTION  Of course, not every Republican candidate has spoken out on the auto industry rescue. Conspicuous among the silent has been Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, who on a trip to Lansing, Michigan, last month, told reporters “that’s a hypothetical question in the past. We’re going to talk about the future.” As MSNBC's Steve Benen noted afterward, Walker has been known to answer hypothetical questions when convenient. Given Wisconsin‘s longstanding ties to the auto industry, it’s possible that Walker may simply understand, better than most Republicans, how much those jobs mean in an area of the country critical to their presidential fortunes."
1,ENTERTAINMENT,Requiem for a Cinematic Heavyweight: Adieu Abu Dhabi Film Festival,"E. Nina Rothe, ContributorCultural Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/requiem-for-a-cinematic-h_b_7528584.html,"Just a few days before this year's Festival de Cannes, those of us who watch, love and write about Arab cinema received a press release from Abu Dhabi that seemed like just another announcement.",2015-06-07,2015-06-07-1433674720-5038113-English_tcm1420257.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-07-1433674720-5038113-English_tcm1420257-thumb.jpg,"Just a few days before this year's Festival de Cannes, those of us who watch, love and write about Arab cinema received a press release from Abu Dhabi that seemed like just another announcement. Sent out by their media hub twofour54, part of the emirate's Media Zone Authority, the release's title ""Abu Dhabi's film industry embarks on a new era"" made me put it aside for later reading. I already knew anyway that the capital of the United Arab Emirates has been getting quite a lot of international productions to film there (most famously Furious 7 and the upcoming Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens) because of the Abu Dhabi Film Commission's 30 percent cash-back rebate, as well as twofour54's recently upgraded state-of-the-art facilities for post-production. So, off I went to tend to the rest of my day, and the press release I received was bound to end up in some folder, never to be looked at again. But then my Facebook homepage and Twitter feed started buzzing, the equivalent on social media of a hundred ringing phones going off at once, with alarming news: the Abu Dhabi Film Festival was no more. Yes, their development and post-production fund SANAD remained, with some familiar names at its helm like festival director Ali Al Jabri and Arabic programmer Intishal Al Timini, but no more event to premiere and showcase the finished products, the beautiful films SANAD is famous for helping to create. Had I missed the big news in the press release? Well, yes, but only because it seemed purposely tucked away among all the other big news, of better facilities, more TV, Hollywood and Bollywood productions, more ambitious plans to come for Abu Dhabi. Yet, here was the news of an eight-year-old, week-long event everyone in the film world looked forward to, a wonderful tradition of cultural interaction and cinematic bridge-building, coming to an end. And its demise told in just one short paragraph, no pomp and circumstance, simply gone. I was left to mourn.Then Cannes rolled around and I had neither the time nor the occasion to think much about ADFF, as the festival was affectionately known to all those who were fortunate enough to have witnessed its magic. Magic. What a perfect word to describe a place, an event, a festival that created the one ray of hope for our overly divided world. With ADFF's demise, I see dire prospects for Arab cinema, to tell you the truth. Of course, there remains that undisputedly wondrous cinematic event of the year for the Emirates, the Dubai International Film Festival. Oscar-qualifying for short films, celebrity filled, red carpet ready and chock full of incredible movies, DIFF is the undeniable king of the festivals in this part of the world. Yet ADFF was a meeting place, of minds and artists, of world-citizens who perhaps held the wrong passports to be friends anywhere else in the world, but in Abu Dhabi felt at home as one. ADFF was equally welcoming to media, filmmakers, film distributors and celebrities, we all interacted and mingled, without divisive velvet ropes. It was a festival I will always remember for the great films I watched there, but also the calm lunches around those large round tables at Emirates Palace where one could find Indian superstar Irrfan Khan to one's right, Iraqi rapper extraordinaire The Narcicyst to one's left and sitting across from all, Iranian autrice Rakhshan Bani-Etemad; where a blogger like me could share the stage with her favorite Palestinian filmmaker Annemarie Jacir for a public ""In Conversation with..."" and learn from the endless wisdom of this poetic writer and director; and where the last edition's jury members included Cannes' Critics' Week director Charles Tesson, Palestinian actor Ali Suliman and Vietnamese master filmmaker Dang Nhat Minh. That was Abu Dhabi Film Festival. And as with all great things, we learn this early on in our lives, it had to come to an end. Or did it?Strictly my own very personal opinion, but while I do understand the commercial implications and financial reasonings for this move, I don't approve, and never will of the final solution. We are living through a time when the obvious dumbing down of our society in general, but more specifically of Arab youths, has finally yielded what some of us could see coming way down the road, long ago: an ultra divided albeit social media interconnected, violently alienated, dangerously intolerant world. And as long as we keep making those blow them up, tie them down, cut them off, intolerant, violent films -- and don't even get me started on video games -- we'll keep yielding the same results. What we see is what we get. Only thoughtful cinema could save us now. So here's my heartfelt eulogy for a film festival with a conscience, ADFF, gone too soon, and sadly missed by all who ever witnessed it. A blog I dedicate to one of its key programmers, Intishal Al Timini, a man who not only understands the value of the press, as much as that of his filmmakers, but also cares for the world around him as much as he cares about his family and his films. And in SANAD we trust, Intishal. so may this incredible work of healing the world, one film at a time, be continued in the upcoming cycles of SANAD funding. Inshallah.Top image courtesy of twofour54.

It's a particular request the Abadi government has made, it's a particular thing we've been working with the Americans on.""Cameron was due to brief U.S. President Barack Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on the plans at the G7. He was also expected to discuss with Obama what more Britain can do to help train moderate Syrian opposition forces in locations outside Syria such as Turkey.Critics say gains made by Islamist militants in both Iraq and Syria show that the U.S.-led strategy against them is faltering, and that Western ground troops are needed.British officials said the new trainers would be deployed in ""a handful of locations"" across Iraq including Taji, Besmaya and Al Asad. Around 100 would carry out IED training, while 25 would focus on first aid, equipment maintenance, or logistics and information support.A spokeswoman for Cameron's office said Islamic State routinely planted large numbers of bombs when retreating, and that training Iraqi forces to clear them would allow local people to return more quickly to their homes.She said the deployment was consistent with the scale of Britain's current engagement in Iraq, and did not herald deeper involvement. After taking part in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003, Britain withdrew the last of its forces in 2011. (Editing by Kevin Liffey)"
3,GREEN,Is Enbridge's Pipeline Treaty with Minnesota an Offering From a  Trickster?,"Georgianne Nienaber, ContributorWriter and author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-enbridges-pipeline-tre_b_7529524.html,"Enbridge Corporation is offering a treaty to the people of Minnesota.

Spring offered the opportunity for spiritual renewal at the Native American sacred sites of Wyoming's Devils Tower and South Dakota's Wind Cave. I was completely dismayed and frustrated to learn that while I was a day's drive from Minnesota, 5,000 people would be gathering in Minneapolis/St. Paul to protest the Tar Sands pipeline expansions through the upper Midwest. Coincidentally, the decision of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to grant a certificate of need to the Enbridge Corporation for the controversial Sandpiper Pipeline, which would carry Bakken oil crude, was also on the minds of the rally organizers and participants. All that remains is the decision on routing, but opponents say there is no upside to a pipeline that threatens Native Treaty lands and the health and welfare of all Minnesotans. Rally Photo Courtesy of Cameron GordonThis week, the Mille Lacs and White Earth Ojibwe communities held hearings against Sandpiper. They had been completely shut out of the decision-making process. Among other threats, the pipeline will potentially desecrate wild rice beds essential to the tribes' identity. I had been writing about this struggle for years, and as I read about what was happening back home in Minnesota, it felt like I was an eternity removed from a critical juncture in the struggle experienced by my Native neighbors. Sometimes frustration requires that you figure out where you are in the moment, and the answer to my unhappy moment came in a quote. ""It affects us psychologically and spiritually... when people climb on this sacred butte and hammer metal objects into it, the butte is defiled and our worship is intruded upon. It is like they pounded something into our bodies.""  Photo of Devils Tower by G. NienaberArvol Looking Horse's words are prominently displayed at the Devils Tower National Monument visitor center. The National Park Service suggests, but it is not mandatory, that climbers respect Native spirituality and refrain from climbing on the Tower during June, which is a ceremonial time. Looking Horse is the spiritual leader among the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota People. The Lakota traditionally held their Sun Dance at Devils Tower around the summer solstice. Bear Lodge, the Lakota name for the Tower, is considered a place of renewal. Unfortunately, recreational climbers are also attracted to the hundreds of hexagonal columns, at least one extending 400 feet, which make Devils Tower one of the premiere climbing destinations in North America. This voluntary climbing closure is an attempt to encourage understanding and respect for indigenous cultures. Of course this does not happen. So, there I was at Devils Tower during the first week in June, and climbers were visible on the rock face and walking the paths. Carabiners rattled and clinked against harnesses, while ropes seemed to morph into imaginary snakes as the climbers strutted along the paths. I am not Native, but I learn from the culture. To anyone seeking spiritual renewal at Devils Tower, the crass arrogance of the climbers felt like an assault. It might be legal to climb, but where is the moral compass of individuals who voluntarily choose to desecrate a sacred site?I was offered a spiritual comparison, and I could be a witness. Maybe it was not necessary to be in Minnesota. Desecration of sacred lands is happening on both sides of the Great Plains. Like climbing, it may be legal for Enbridge Corporation to move forward with a pipeline through native treaty lands, but is it moral? Is it moral for the Twin Cities NBC affiliate, KARE-11 News, to air a commercial from Enbridge on the Saturday evening broadcast that covered the march of 5,000 against the pipeline?Enbridge was given the opportunity to promote what was essentially a paid rebuttal to the message of the anti-pipeline organizers.In a prepared statement, Honor the Earth's Winona LaDuke, former Vice-Presidential candidate and resident of Minnesota's White Earth Reservation, had this to say about moral resolve.This is going to be a very hard battle against Enbridge and to protect our lakes. I am asking all of you to help us with action -- prayers -- and (with) words (to) draw attention to our issue with public officials and your neighbors. The Minnesota PUC is not likely to think or act wisely, so we are going to have to rely on our tribal leadership, our people and our resilience to fight back big oil. There is a lot of talk about how the pipelines will stop the bomb trains. And what we all know is that we have to stop all of this. I also visited Wind Cave.The Lakota have centuries of oral history, and a creation story that has survived. Oral tradition offers meaning and a preternatural prediction of what would happen to the people of the spirit world when they ventured through the opening of Wind Cave into what promised to be a good life on earth. Inktomi, the Trickster, traveled beneath the earth in the form of a wolf and convinced the people to follow him to the surface. The majority stayed behind, because this was against the wishes of the Creator, who wanted to prepare the people for life on earth. It was not yet time. When this first group arrives, it becomes obvious that Inktomi has tricked them. They cannot return to Wind Cave, there is no food, and they starve.The group that remained was blessed by Creator and finally led to the surface, but to this day suffer because of the antics of Inktomi.When we turned out the lights in Wind Cave and experienced total darkness and silence, it was easy to imagine the people being led through this impossible labyrinth by a trusted leader who was in harmony with Creator.Chase Iron Eyes talks about the TricksterWe all must find our moral compass and leaders to guide us through the treachery and trickery of this world. Legality does not always offer morality. Broken treaties and broken promises litter the history of indigenous culture. Enbridge Corporation is offering a treaty to the people of Minnesota. Like Inktomi, Enbridge offers promises of riches and an easy life. Is this yet another offering from the Trickster?Note: Devils Tower was misnamed and misspelled by whites. The Native name is Mato Tipila, meaning Bear Lodge, and an interpreter for an early government mapper made a mistake and translated it as ""Bad God's Tower."""

9,POLITICS,Florida House Rejects Plan To Expand Health Care For Hundreds Of Thousands,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-health-care-expansion_n_7525346.html,,2015-06-06,"Florida Gov. Rick Scott gives the opening remarks during Rick Scott's Economic Growth Summit in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., Tuesday, June 2, 2015. (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fece3c000018010e0470.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Florida House of Representatives voted Friday to reject a state Senate bill that would have expanded Medicaid for thousands, marking a victory for Republican Gov. Rick Scott.Following a heated six-hour debate, the Republican-controlled House voted 72-41 against the measure, which passed in the state Senate earlier this week. The proposal would have used $18 billion in federal funds over a decade to help low-income workers purchase health care plans from private providers. The program would have expanded Medicaid for hundreds of thousands of Floridians. However, Republican state lawmakers have been vehemently opposed to using Affordable Care Act funds to expand health care in Florida. Scott had said he would reject the legislation if it passed. During debate in the House, opponents derided the legislation as expensive, overreaching and “just Obamacare with a clever name,"" as state Rep. John Wood (R) put it. “It's something we cannot afford, not only in Florida but in the rest of the nation, if we have government controlled health care,” state Rep. Doug Broxson (R) said, according to The New York Times. ""History tells us that anything the government is involved in tends to expand. I’m very concerned that we could spend all our gross national product on health care, and it would take away from every other program we have in the state.""Democrats charged that Republicans were overly focused on voting against Medicaid expansion and, according to House Democratic Leader Mark Pafford, ""were battling a demon that doesn't exist.""""If [this bill] is not the answer, then what is?'' Pafford asked, according to the Tampa Bay Times. ""We'll be back and we'll be talking about the same issue because it's going to haunt the state of Florida.""According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Florida has the second-highest uninsured rate in the country, with 24.3 percent of residents lacking health care in 2013. Friday's vote marks the third time Florida legislators have rejected expanding health care since the Affordable Care Act passed. Scott, meanwhile, has changed his mind on the issue several times. He initially opposed expanding Medicaid under the health care law, citing concerns over job growth. Then in 2013, he reversed course, citing his mother's death in professing his support for bringing federal funds to Florida to broaden health care coverage. The governor later backed off on his support, and earlier this year announced he would sue the federal government for allegedly forcing his state to expand Medicaid by withholding federal hospital funds."
10,POLITICS,Why Join the Military With a Reckless (Meaning Republican) Commander-In-Chief?,"Doug Bandow, ContributorContributing writer, policy analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-join-the-military-with-a-reckless-meaning-republican-commander-in-chief_b_7524954.html,"Should Americans join the military if the next commander-in-chief of the armed services is an arrogant, ignorant, irresponsible, war-happy hawk? Many of America's best and brightest join the armed services. But with the U.S. constantly at war, joining is a life or death decision, dependent on the judgment of whoever sits in the Oval Office.",2015-06-06,"Former Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas speaking at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland. Please attribute to Gage Skidmore if used elsewhere.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fecd210000d601c97106.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former governor and presidential candidate Michael Huckabee issued a clarion call for young Americans not to join the military if he or virtually any Republican wins the presidency in 2016. Well, that's not exactly what he said. But it was the obvious implication of his remarks.Huckabee declared: ""I'd wait a couple of years, until we got a new commander-in-chief, that will once again believe one nation under God and believes that people of faith should be a vital part of the process of not only governing, but defending this country."" It was an oblique, even confusing attack on President Barack Obama. Apparently the former Baptist pastor was upset about Pentagon restrictions on proselytizing within the armed services.It's a fair area for debate since the Obama administration sometimes has taken a careless, if not hostile, stance toward religious liberty. But there's no evidence that the president doesn't want people of faith joining the military (or being involved in ""governing,"" whatever that means). However, Huckabee inadvertently raised a far more important issue. Should Americans join the military if the next commander-in-chief of the armed services is an arrogant, ignorant, irresponsible, war-happy hawk? Patriotic young men and women want to serve their country, challenge themselves and more. Many of America's best and brightest join the armed services. But with the U.S. constantly at war, joining is a life or death decision, dependent on the judgment of whoever sits in the Oval Office.There is much to criticize in President Obama's foreign policy. He is too aggressive -- twice increasing troop levels in Afghanistan, and recently prolonging the U.S. presence, going to war in Libya, making the Islamic State's sectarian conflict America's own, putting combat and training personnel in a number of smaller conflicts, including Uganda and Ukraine. The administration's execution also often suffers. Sadly, the word incompetent comes to mind.Nevertheless, the president apparently is thoughtful and thus reluctant to loose the dogs of war. In contrast, ever-angry 2008 presidential candidate John McCain urges war in virtually every circumstance. He never seems to think about the consequences of bombing or invading other nations. One would be a real risk-taker to join the military under such a commander-in-chief.President George W. Bush demonstrated a different set of faults. By all accounts he knew little about the countries he was invading and peoples he was fighting. He believed the fairy tale promises of more ""optimistic"" advisers. He wasn't willing to finish what he started, essentially abandoning the Afghan war, which was tied to 9/11, to initiate the far most disastrous Iraq war, which was unrelated to the attack on America. Bush then refused to accept responsibility while carrying on with a failed policy. As a consequence, more than 4,500 American service members, plus other U.S. employees and contractors, died needlessly. New enemies and enemy organizations were created, such as the Islamic State, which are active today. Iran was greatly empowered, the same Iran that most of the current GOP presidential candidates believe should be bombed. It is a miracle -- or a testament to so many Americans' deep patriotism -- that anyone enlisted while Bush was president (and Richard Cheney was vice president, a scary heartbeat away from the Oval Office).The 2016 contenders are almost all worse than President Obama. There are some outliers, like Sen. Rand Paul and former Senators Jim Webb and Lincoln Chaffee. A few others are unclear players such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former governors Jeb Bush and Martin O'Malley. The first group take a more nuanced and restrained approach to foreign policy, though not all their positions are consistent. The others so far have not committed themselves or have given conflicting signals. The other contenders appear more interested in promoting ideology than addressing reality in foreign policy. For instance, Hillary Clinton has spent most of her political life as a hawk. She reportedly was a leading advocate of military action in the Balkans in the 1990s -- a complicated, murderous conflict of primary interest to Europe in which the U.S. ignored massive ethnic cleansing by its allies, Croatia and the ethnic Albanian Kosovars. Bosnia and Kosovo remain problems because the U.S. attempted to impose a ""solution"" from outside through force.As senator, Clinton voted to authorize the Iraq war, the most foolish, counterproductive foreign policy decision by the U.S. government in decades. Iran was empowered, sectarianism exploded in Iraq, and radical forces including the Islamic State were born. She obviously learned no lessons, however. As secretary of state, Clinton was a constant advocate of more war. She appeared to enthusiastically back the force build-up in Afghanistan and insisted that war was an option against Iran. Observed neocon intellectual Robert Kagan: ""I feel comfortable with her on foreign policy."" He told the New York Times that her policy is ""something that might have been called neocon, but clearly her supporters are not going to call it that.""Libya was Clinton's war. That conflict was supposed to be another cakewalk. Alas, it resulted in thousands of deaths, multiple war atrocities, an incipient civil war, another home for Islamic State killers, and the regional spread of arms, including anti-aircraft missiles. The good news is that no Americans died fighting. But Americans stationed in Libya died afterwards, on her watch, and now are at risk battling the Islamic State. Out of office, she supported the president's initial plan for bombing Syria over its apparent use of chemical weapons as well as re-involvement in Iraq to fight the Islamic State.When has she ever supported peace? Anyone serving under her should recognize the risks of being sent into another foolish, counterproductive war.However, most of the Republicans are no better -- indeed, some are a good deal worse. Lindsey Graham is running in order to promote a policy of constant conflict. In recent years he joined with John McCain to advocate on behalf of every war fought and many not started. If Graham was president, members of the armed services could expect to spend years overseas occupying and remaking foreign societies. Kind of a permanent Afghan-Iraqi policy, only everywhere.The media has anointed Sen. Marco Rubio as having ""expertise"" in foreign policy, despite his endorsement every war since his election in 2010. He backed bombing Libya, bombing Syria, bombing the Islamic State, and possibly attacking Iran. Apparently unaware that Iran was, if anything, even more hostile than Washington to the Islamic State, Rubio recently combined bellicosity with ignorance. Alas, George W. Bush demonstrated that that is a really bad combination for a president. (Rubio also has taken on the contradictory task of promoting new thinking while backing the half century old economic embargo on Cuba.)A couple of former governors, Huckabee and Rick Perry, previously ran as ""bomb-first"" neocons, believing that most every foreign policy problem would be solved by another war. A gaggle of governors -- Scott Walker, Chris Christie, and Bobby Jindal -- avoided much of the foreign policy debate while serving but generally have been attempting to outflank each other with hawkish pronouncements. None has demonstrated knowing very much about the subject and, in general, they have backed the Iraq war, inveighed against the nuclear agreement with Iran (the alternative to which likely is a nuclear Iran or war with Iran), insisted in increased military outlays, spouted the usual pabulum about the importance of ""leadership"" and ""toughness,"" and denounced President Obama as weak. It is hard to know what they would do in any particular instance, but taken at their word they likely would send military personnel into combat for reasons minor or even frivolous.One suspects that when the issue of foreign policy comes up at the Republican presidential debates, most of these candidates will break into the Maori Haka in an attempt to demonstrate that they are tougher and meaner and readier for war than their competitors. That is, unless someone reminds them that New Zealand is a peaceful nation which does not constantly start stupid wars. Other Republicans who today are back benchers might come to the fore with an uber-hawkish president. Sen. Tom Cotton, for instance, recently made a thinly veiled appeal for military action against Iran despite the prospect of a negotiated settlement. But he argued it wasn't anything to worry about, that a few days of bombing would suffice. Even more bizarrely, he contended that ""You have to be focused everywhere."" The failure to set priorities really works well in wars.All of the Republicans, including Rand Paul, also advocate essentially a blank check for the Pentagon, adopting the traditional Democratic position that spending more money on something is the same as achieving something. Paul, at least, wants to cut other outlays as an offset. Most of the candidates simply favor more money for more wars, wherever they might be fought. What's a patriotic potential service member to do? Pine for Ronald Reagan. It's not just the grand rhetoric of freedom and genuine appreciation for military service. It's also his very restrained, responsible use of the armed services. Caricatured as a wild cowboy, he only used the military three times. Once to oust a bloody communist regime in nearby Grenada which, he contended, threatened American students in medical school there. Another instance was to retaliate against Libya for a terrorist attack. The last was to support Lebanon's government in the middle of that nation's tragic civil war. The first two were finished quickly. The third proved to be a horrible mistake, from which Reagan learned. He didn't send in another 100,000 troops, impose a multi-year occupation, and engage in nation-building. Instead, he pulled the troops out. And he never repeated that mistake.Michael Huckabee is right. Americans should consider the commander-in-chief before joining the military. Unfortunately for Huckabee, if they did so they would disqualify him and most of the other presidential contenders. Voters should insist on good military as well as moral character.This article first appeared in Forbes online."

At the end of the day, we are our own Alchemists turning the silver we were born with into the gold we are destined to become. Nanette Lepore - American Fashion Designer based in New YorkWhat was it like emerging as a designer in the late 80's and early 90's and how have you seen the industry evolve over the past 20 years? It was very much an adventure. We had a lot of wonderful days and we had some bad days, but when I look back on it, I was a pioneer in the contemporary market in America. When I started, there were just a handful of designers and so much opportunity. There were so many small factories within the garment center to help you get your work done and so many experts for us to absorb information from. It was a wide-open field. I would call buyers and they would come running down within a day or two. They were so excited for newness in American designers. It was a wonderful time. What are new challenges you're facing as far as growing the business? Keeping excitement around the brand and keeping brand integrity. We have a culture to our company that feels like family. We have fun times together. People who wear my clothing come up to me with stories about where they wore my clothes and how meaningful it was to them. My name and brand reminds people of a happy time--their first date, a big party, or a wedding reception. When you have a great memory, you remember what you were wearing, so I've managed to stay with a lot of women in their lives.You had a daughter at 38. There are superwomen who are able to build their careers and start a family and there are women who can't do it all at once and feel like they have to choose. If given the opportunity, would you do anything differently or do you have any advice that you could give looking back? Not everyone wants to be a mother, but if that's a desire you have, it's something you have to confront earlier rather than later. I was worried about living in a small apartment and paying tuition for a school. Could I afford a child? I was building a business and working really long hours, so I put off what I should've started no later than 35. I used to tell everyone, you have to start by the time you're 34, because for me I didn't even start trying until I was 37. I had five miscarriages and it was really sad. Everyone just assumes that they're above problems of fertility until you start getting into it and start dealing with it. It can be really disheartening. You can manage more than you think. You manage your time better because you have to. You're forced to allot your time thoughtfully. I was lucky. I was able to bring her to work. I had a lot of conveniences that not every mom has. She was here with me, so even though I was working long hours, I didn't feel a separation. What type of role model do you aspire to be for your daughter and other young women? I'd like them to approach things without fear. Don't hold yourself back, follow your dreams, and push forward. The key thing is to have friends, family, and fun with what you're doing. I would love to make sure my daughter has a tight family and knows how to have fun. Even though you're going to work everyday and you work hard you still have to cut out those times in life where your real memories are created. I have always worked really hard, but I've always balanced it with a lot of friends and family around me and I feel really happy doing that. It's warm and welcoming. I like to impress that on young women. You have to balance your expectations within yourself so you don't beat yourself up when things go wrong and you don't get too ahead of yourself when things go well. I always try to balance my expectations so it's realistic. Has there been a shift in perspective for you in your life? One big thing was realizing that NYC factories and manufacturing were at risk and taking on the role of raising awareness. We have craftsmen here in New York and we need to protect those factories so we can have American manufacturing by skilled craftsmen. Factories were in need and they didn't have a voice. Factory owners and button suppliers would come into the office and thank me for what myself and my company has done. The paradigm shift I've seen was in the way I see people shop; they're making purposeful purchases that they feel good about.What kind of legacy do you wish to leave behind? I want everyone to remember we always had a really good time. I hope people will remember that I made beautiful clothing. I really hope I made a mark in the world of design and I'm remembered for my workmanship and for being someone great to work with and for having a great company culture and for having been able to build a big American business with a $5,000 loan. What you really take away when talking with Nanette is how much she really cares. The love she puts into everything she does is so apparent its infectious. She has that special ability to leave a positive and lasting impression everywhere she goes. I have been shifted."

June 6 (Reuters) - While still unable to agree on a budget, Kansas lawmakers on Saturday averted a furlough of thousands of non-essential employees by passing a bill defining all employees as essential, officials said.Republican Governor Sam Brownback said in a statement posted on his website that he will sign the bill so that state services can continue working uninterrupted.The Kansas House and Senate have been in session for more than two weeks past the usual adjournment date while trying to make up a $400 million deficit for the budget year that begins on July 1.Income tax cuts engineered by Brownback and approved by the Republican-dominated legislature three years ago have created revenue shortfalls. The governor said the cuts would help Kansas compete with bordering Missouri and other states to draw business.Lawmakers recently rejected Brownback's proposed sales tax hike to raise revenue.Furloughs loomed for about 7,100 non-essential executive branch employees on Monday because of the budget gridlock, according to the state's Department of Administration.About 17,000 other non-essential employees, mostly in the state's major university systems, also faced furloughs, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal newspaper.The bill passed unanimously by the House and Senate on Saturday declares all employees essential but could mean pay will be delayed until the budget is approved.""The solution is for the legislature to continue its work, and bring to my desk a balanced budget with sufficient revenues to pay state obligations and do so now,"" Brownback said. ""It is past time for the Legislature to act."" (Reporting By Kevin Murphy in Kansas City; Editing by Grant McCool)"

Your duty is to take the direct political responsibility and report the truth.""",2015-06-06,"FILE - FILE - In this Sept. 5, 2010 file photo, Tariq Aziz, Saddam Hussein's long time foreign minister, speaks to the Associated Press in Baghdad, Iraq. Officials say Aziz has died in a hospital in southern Iraq on Friday, June 5, 2015. (AP Photo/Hadi Mizban, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fed41f00004002258021.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The last time I saw Tariq Aziz in person, it was early September, 2002. We were sitting across from each other in the lounge of a posh South African hotel. He was waiting for a meeting with the South African Deputy Foreign Minister, Aziz Pahad. I was trying to convince him that my plan to travel to Baghdad and address the Iraqi Parliament about the need to allow UN weapons inspectors to return to work was not an early symptom of dementia on my part. For nearly seven years, from 1991 until 1998, I had been the nemesis of the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and the Iraqi government, leading UN inspection teams on an often contentious and confrontational game of cat and mouse in a search for proscribed weapons of mass destruction. During that time, Tariq Aziz often gave international press conferences where he accused the teams I led of using ""commando tactics"", and called me an agent of the CIA. He wasn't too far off base - my teams made use of site exploitation techniques taught by American military personnel, and I liaised extensively with the CIA and the intelligence services of numerous supporting nations (including Israel) when preparing for an inspection.The hand-in-glove relationship between the UN weapons inspectors and the intelligence services of nations whose policy toward Iraq leaned more toward regime change than weapons disposal was a major factor in the Iraqi government decision to stop cooperating with UN inspectors. The inspection teams were ordered to withdraw by the United States in December 1998, just prior to the commencement of an extensive bombing ostensibly targeting weapons of mass destruction (WMD) capability we know today did not exist at that time. I was now asking Tariq Aziz to entertain the return of inspectors in an effort to forestall an even greater commitment of American military might.""This is an old story, Mr. Ritter,"" Tariq Aziz told me, after lighting one of the ubiquitous oversized Cohiba cigars that had become his trademark. ""We don't need you to retell it to us. We don't need you to try and save us - we don't need saving.""""That may very well be true,"" I replied. ""But to be honest, I don't give a damn about you or the Iraqi people. If you want to engage in policies that lead to your destruction, that is your business. But as a former Marine Corps officer, I can't stand by idly while Marines fight and die in a war that can, and should, be prevented. I'm not doing this to save Iraqi lives - I'm doing it to save the lives of Marines, to save the lives of all the Americans who would die in such a war.""Tariq Aziz was wearing a business suit, not the crisp green military uniform I was accustomed seeing him in during my previous forays into Iraq. He took a long drag from his Cohiba, and blew the smoke out, his eyes narrowing as he contemplated my words. His aides approached him, signaling that it was time for his meeting. ""I respect you, Mr. Ritter, and I respect your motives. I will contact the appropriate authorities in Iraq, and you will be welcome in Baghdad."" We stood, and he extended his hand. ""Is there anything else you need?""I shook his hand, and then gestured to his cigar. ""I'll take one of those, if you don't mind. I'll smoke it when war has been averted.""Tariq Aziz laughed, and reached into his coat pocket, withdrawing a Cohiba. ""I hope you will be able to enjoy this soon,"" he said, before being ushered away. I never did get to smoke that cigar.Tariq Aziz was ostensibly in South Africa to attend the Earth Summit and meet with the UN Secretary General and other world leaders in an effort to resolve the issue of Iraq's WMD programs. ""Everybody in the world should know that there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq,"" he told CNN, and every other major media outlet, repeating the same claims he had made over the years. But there was another reason, one that he kept secret from the world. Shortly after his meeting with Mr. Pahad, Tariq Aziz was whisked away to a hospital, where a noted South African cardiologist performed a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention, where a mesh stent was inserted in an artery leading from his heart. Tariq Aziz had a long history of heart disease, and on June 5, 2015 he finally succumbed to its ravages, dying of a heart attack while imprisoned in Iraq. He was 79 years old.My experiences with Tariq Aziz solely centered on the subject of inspections and WMD. After the invasion and occupation of Iraq by a US-led coalition in 2003, Tariq Aziz surrendered to US soldiers and was placed under arrest. In 2003 he was sentenced to death by an Iraqi tribunal for his role in the execution of 42 Iraqi merchants accused of black market profiteering while Iraq labored under international sanctions. I have no insight or knowledge of his guilt or innocence in that matter - I judge him solely on the basis of my work as an inspector.During the first four years I was in Iraq, Tariq Aziz was just a name and a face I saw on television, or read about in the newspaper or minutes of meetings held between him and my boss, the Swedish head of the UN inspection regime, Rolf Ekéus. While at the time I vehemently opposed his conclusions that Iraq was free of WMD, some of his arguments resonated. ""The United States,"" he said in early 1992, ""has said it would not lift sanctions until the Iraqi regime was changed. If this was the case, why should Iraq cooperate with the [inspectors]? If the [Security Council] resolutions were implemented in a fair manner and sanctions eased, Iraq would cooperate. If Iraq got nothing for cooperation, no purpose would be served. There must be reciprocity.""Tariq Aziz would be frustrated in this regard. Inspections continued. In July 1996 I finally got to meet Tariq Aziz in person. After several days of trying to gain access to a facility near what was at the time called Saddam International Airport, only to be blocked by armed members of Saddam Hussein's Presidential security forces, a negotiated settlement was reached where the team would be escorted in by senior Iraqi officials. The site, which U-2 surveillance photographs showed to be involved in what we believed was an evacuation of sensitive documents during an earlier inspection effort, turned out to be a bodyguard unit for the Iraqi President. Inside, waiting for us, was none other than Tariq Aziz himself, cigar firmly clenched in his teeth, a scowl on his face. ""You see,"" he told the inspectors, ""no weapons. Nothing.""It was a theme he continued through the years. In August 1998, in what was my last meeting with Tariq Aziz as a weapons inspector, he lambasted the lack of progress after more than seven years of inspections. ""It is your job to report the truth to the Security Council,"" he told Richard Butler, the Australian diplomat who took over from Rolf Ekéus in the summer of 1997. ""The truth is that Iraq has no proscribed weapons or capabilities in any areas within the mandate of the Special Commission...your duty is to take the direct political responsibility and report the truth.""  Often derided as a mouthpiece of the Iraqi regime, Tariq Aziz was an intelligent, articulate man who, as it turned out, was telling the truth the whole time."
17,WORLDPOST,Why Beijing Is Censoring Information About The Cruise Ship Disaster,Eline Gordts,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/china-cruise-disaster-media_n_7515030.html,,2015-06-06,"Chinese soldiers stand near a wrapped body as rescuers work on the capsized ship, center, on the Yangtze River in central China's Hubei province Wednesday, June 3, 2015. Hopes dimmed Wednesday for rescuing more than 400 people still trapped in the capsized river cruise ship that overturned in stormy weather, as hundreds of rescuers searched the Yangtze River site in what could become the deadliest Chinese maritime accident in decades. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14f06240000360076f570.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic that's making headlines around the world. Today, we speak with Jeremy Goldkorn, the founder and director of Danwei.China suffered one of the worst maritime disasters in its recent history this week when a cruise ship with more than 400 people aboard capsized in the Yangtze river. The four-deck Eastern Star was on its way from the city of Nanjing to the city of Chongqing on Monday night when it encountered a severe storm and overturned. Fourteen people survived the tragedy, including the ship's captain and first engineer. Rescue teams had recovered 103 bodies by Friday night. More than 300 passengers remain missing. Chinese authorities have severely restricted access to information about both the causes of the tragedy and the efforts to recover the victims' bodies. In recent days, however, families of passengers across the country have increasingly voiced frustration with that lack of information. On Wednesday night, several family members forced their way through a police cordon to get to the disaster site, and on Friday a relative of two of the passengers burst into a press conference demanding an investigation into possible human error. The WorldPost spoke with Jeremy Goldkorn about the way Chinese authorities are handling the flow of information about the tragedy. Goldkorn is the founder and director of Danwei, a research firm that tracks Chinese media and Internet. Several media outlets reported this week that Chinese authorities have kept a tight lid on information about the maritime disaster in Jianli. What are Chinese leaders aiming to accomplish by restricting information?To put it in historical perspective, the Chinese Communist Party has always controlled information about disasters very tightly. The handling of the aftermath of disasters is obviously the government's responsibility, but there's also a long-held belief in the country that even the occurrence of natural disasters can in some way be seen as the government's fault. After the Tangshan earthquake in the 1976, the government basically tried to prevent any spread of information. The government has been a lot more transparent in recent years, partly because the Internet has made complete coverups impossible. A look back at the Wenzhou train crash of 2011 helps explain the authorities' current reaction, because it was the first time social media made the government lose control of the narrative. In the weekend of the Wenzhou accident, most of the information about the train crash came from citizens who were posting on Weibo (a Twitter-like microblog service). The government was one step behind ordinary people writing about the tragedy and criticizing the government's response. That really woke up the government to the possibility of social media, and there have been a number of measures put in place since then, not only to control narratives about natural disasters but also political dissent. In the case of the cruise ship sinking, social media is certainly highly censored, and there is a lot of pro-government propaganda on social media talking about how the government is doing a good job.  How does the information that Chinese readers and viewers received about this tragedy differ from what an international audience gets to see?There have been tight restrictions on Chinese news media. They're kept away from the scene and told to rely on the authorized copy put out by the Xinhua news agency. International reporters have also struggled with access, but they certainly have greater freedom to report and publish what they want since they don’t take their orders from the propaganda department or the state council's information office. So in terms of actual reporting, foreign reporters have not had an easy time either, but they have much more latitude about what the organization ends up writing or broadcasting. Has there been a public demand for more information?There hasn’t been any kind of well-organized campaign, and if anyone tried to start one it would be wiped off the Internet. It looks like there have been some attempts by citizens to demand more information from the government or from the cruise company, and these have been repressed. In Shanghai for example, there were scuffles between relatives of people who were probably victims and the police, and it appears those people were trying to get information. Do you think the Chinese authorities' strategy is successful or counterproductive in the long run? It is successful in limiting any kind of damage to the government's reputation in the short term, but one of the country's problems is that there's a tremendous lack of trust in Chinese society. Most people are suspicious of the story that they’re getting from the government. They usually won’t say that publicly, but one of the reasons why you get people clashing with the police is because they don’t believe what they’re getting told. This happens pretty much every time there’s a disaster of some kind. We saw it this week, we saw it when the Malaysian Airlines plane disappeared and after the New Year’s Eve stampede in Shanghai at the beginning of this year. So it is a successful strategy to minimize any kind of organized threat to the rule of the Communist Party, both in the immediate and long run, but it doesn’t do the Chinese government any good in building a society where there is more trust, both between citizens and also from citizens to the government. People are unable to organize dissent, but they aren't really going to believe in President Xi Jinping's much propagandized ""Chinese Dream"" either.This article has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Times newspaper reported on Friday, citing unidentified sources.Department investigators found evidence indicating Ford had struggled for control of one of the patrolmen's gun, supporting the account the officers gave after the incident, the newspaper cited two sources as saying.The department's inspector general, Alex Bustamante, also found the shooting justified, but faulted the officers for the manner in which they approached Ford in the moments before the shooting, the Times reported, citing the sources.Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman Jane Kim said the department would not offer any comment ahead of a Police Commission meeting on Tuesday, when the civilian watchdog group is scheduled to weigh the use of deadly force and the officers' behavior.The newspaper said Beck will recommend to the oversight commission that the officers be cleared of wrongdoing.Bustamante will recommend the panel fault the officers for their tactics based on the findings of his own investigation. The board makes a final ruling, the newspaper said.Two officers shot Ezell Ford, who was 25 and described by family attorneys as mentally challenged, on Aug. 11 last year after he struggled with one of them and tried to grab the policeman's holstered service revolver.Ford's death came two days after the fatal police shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, that triggered a wave of protests alleging excessive use of force by authorities.Ford's death was also greeted with street demonstrations and the family filed a federal lawsuit over the shooting, seeking $75 million in damages.In March, Ford's parents filed a second lawsuit against the police department and city, alleging their son was targeted for excessive force because of his skin color.

In Britain, still without conscription, a new campaign to enlist more troops was initiated. In June and July 1915, almost 50,000 fresh troops were sent to reinforce the 80,000 already in the Dardanelles.  Allied Landings in Gallipoli, April-August 1915The stalemate dragged on into the summer as Allied troops suffered in the scorching heat and disease-ridden conditions. In July the British reinforced the bridgehead at Anzac Cove. The following month, on August 6, 20,000 fresh reinforcements attempted to seize the Sari Bair heights by landing troops at Suvla Bay, to the north. The plan was to drive across the peninsula and cut off Turkish forces in the South. In the face of Ottoman counter-attacks, the initiative failed within days. ANZAC Cemetery at GallipoliThe landings on Suvla Bay marked the start of a general offensive by the Allied troops to break out of their beachheads. Commanded by Mustafa Kemal, Turkish reinforcements were brought up and thrown into the battle, and once again the Allies failed to make any significant advances. The casualties were terrible. The Allies lost over 45,000 men in the first ten days of the offensive. Ottoman losses were almost 40,000.In mid-October, Kitchener replaced Hamilton with Lt. General Sir Charles Munroe. He immediately recommended to Kitchener a complete withdrawal from Gallipoli even though, he believed, it could cost another 40,000 casualties to do so. Following a personal inspection by Kitchener in November, the order was given to withdraw.  Allied Troops Under Fire at GallipoliThe troops were evacuated by the end of January 1916. Despite pouring in half a million men, the Allies had been unable to take the south of the Gallipoli peninsula and link up their beachheads, let alone march to Constantinople. Allied forces had suffered over 250,000 casualties of which 50,000 had been killed. Turkish casualties were between 250,000 and 350,000. A final potential catastrophe was averted. Over 119,000 men were evacuated safely. Turkish soldiers, refusing to attack, just let them go. Evacuation from Gallipoli, January 1916There was one other consequence of the Gallipoli campaign. It was there that the legend of the Anzac's would be forged. Approximately 17,000 Australian and New Zealand troops had landed on the Aegean side of the Gallipoli peninsula in April of 1915. They were called the ""Anzacs"", short for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. British Military planners, too lazy to keep writing out the full name, had conveniently shortened it to Anzac. It was as the Anzacs that they would fight in the suffocating heat and the wretched, stinking conditions of Gallipoli and it was as the Anzacs that they would pass into history and into legend. ANZAC Troops Preparing to Depart for Egypt, Albany Western Australia 1914They came as ""Empire Men"", loyal members of a British Empire that then spanned a quarter of the globe. Few had ever seen the mother country, most never would, but they were the products of its culture, its heritage and its institutions. When king and country called, they answered by the thousands. Almost half a million Australians and New Zealanders would ultimately see action in the Great War. They would fight and they would die. At Gallipoli two out of every three Anzacs would be killed or wounded fighting in a war they did not start, for a mother country they had never seen.It was at Gallipoli that they would begin to forge a national identity. They may have come as ""Empire Men,"" but they would leave with a budding consciousness that first and foremost they were Australians and New Zealanders. It was also at Gallipoli that a young Australian journalist named Keith Murdoch, the father of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, would achieve international fame for his account of the military bungling that characterized the campaign.  Keith MurdockIn the end, militarily, the Gallipoli campaign achieved nothing. The Ottoman Empire was not knocked out of the war. The Turkish military proved itself to be far more formidable, especially in a defensive role, than it had been given credit for. No new lifelines to Russia were established, the Eastern Front was not expanded and the stalemate between the two sides continued. Encouraged by the Ottoman success, Bulgaria declared for the Central powers. Greece, in order to avert an attack from Bulgaria, promptly joined the Allies.

The bay stallion has already made his owner, Zayat Stables, $3.7 million in winnings and he could score $800,000 of the Belmont Stakes' $1.5 million purse, according to the International Business Times. If American Pharoah wins the Belmont Stakes today, he'll be the victor of the Triple Crown of Thorough Racing. The Triple Crown is a victory in the three major American horse races and American Pharoah has already won two: the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.But unlike a professional human athlete, American Pharoah's earning power will peak years after he retires from the sport. He could earn $100 million over his lifetime as a stud, breeding with elite mares to produce champion foals. And he'll be far more valuable as a Triple Crown winner. ""If this horse wins the Triple Crown, it will be a frenzy,"" David Ingordo, a bloodstock agent who has worked with Zayat, told CNBC.It will take a few years to see whether American Pharoah's progeny inherit their father's racing prowess. If they do, then owners of female horses will pay enormous sums to breed their mares with him. And that's how he could reach the $100 million mark. Reiley McDonald, a managing partner with thoroughbred firm Eaton Sales, explained the logic to the International Business Times. ""If they stand [breed] him as a Triple Crown winner for $100,000 to $150,000 and breed 150 mares to him... you do the math, that’s significantly more than what he can make as a race horse during the season.” Zayat sold American Pharoah's breeding rights to Coolmore Stud, who will reap the majority of his earnings as a stud.

This past week, I was actually there for a wonderful day. I was a fundraising speaker for BookFest Windsor, speaking at the lovely Old Walkerville Theatre, in the revived and thriving neighborhood named after famed distiller Hiram Walker. His former estate is now used for public functions and was being set up for an art fair while I was there.The surrounding homes are varied and the neighborhood verdant, and when you get to the ""downtown"" of Walkerville, it's bustling and filled with cool restaurants like Lorelei's Bistro. The booths there have curtains if you're in the mood for privacy, though I was there for business. I had a fantastic meal highlighted by one of my favorite foods in Canada, poutine, which may once have been fast food, but has been served in very upscale forms for a long time now. Mine was made with shredded prime rib, and I savored it with a Pillitteri Riesling that reminded me of a terrific wine tour I did of the Niagara region years ago. The staff was friendly and convivial, and so were CBC's Bob Steele and Noxtrom Digital Media's Shay Rachelle who interviewed about my reason for being in Windsor. That evening, I spoke at the theatre about growing up as the son of Holocaust survivors, how that affected my consciousness and how my life changed when I went to Germany for the first of many trips as an author. I read the preface of My Germany, the memoir/travelogue I wrote as a result of some of those book tours. Then I did one of those sit down Q&As with my host, the charming and indefatigable Christina Woods who organizes Windsor's yearly BookFest before audience questions and a lively book signing.My hotel, The Waterfront, had a panoramic view of Detroit, which is most impressive at night and was the best thing about it -- that and being close to the Detroit Windsor Tunnel, though my new car's GPS refused to get me back there. Shades of Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey! Maybe it wanted me to stay a bit longer? I certainly intend to return and explore Windsor more since it's so very close to home -- yet in another country.Lev Raphael is the Michigan author of 25 books in many genres which you can find on Amazon.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14f34240000320076f57c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Apparently incapable of resisting the temptation to meddle in the Middle East, the Obama administration remains part of Saudi Arabia's ten-member ""coalition"" against Houthi rebels in Yemen. Said Secretary of State John Kerry: ""We're not going to step away from our alliances and our friendships."" The administration is providing intelligence, logistical aid, arms shipments and even a naval flotilla, including an American aircraft carrier, to monitor Iranian ships. Apparently Washington wants to block any Iranian military aid for Houthi rebels while underwriting Saudi aggression. Alas, the entire campaign is built on a lie. Contrary to Riyadh's claims, the Houthis are not directed by, and seem only barely supported by, Iran. Even British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond admitted that ""the Houthis are clearly not Iranian proxies."" Instead, the rebels have been fighting for years. Yemen was only reunited in 1990 and has spent most of the succeeding years rent by crime, unrest and conflict. The Houthis, classified as a Shia sect (Zaydi) despite some theological similarities to Sunnis, have been in rebellion for years. Filmmaker Safa al-Ahmad, who produced a documentary on the Houthis, commented that they ""don't need Iranians to bring them weapons. They're awash in weapons."" America's then-ally, President Ali Abdullah Saleh, actually used U.S.-supplied arms to battle the Houthis a decade ago. But after Saleh was ousted in 2012, he allied with the Houthis against his successor, President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi. The newly empowered rebels -- many of the official security forces remained loyal to Saleh -- ousted Hadi last fall. Saleh may have hoped to install his son as president.Those familiar with Yemeni politics agreed that none of this had anything to do with Iran or Saudi Arabia. Argued journalist Peter Salisbury, the conflict, like previous fights, was ""driven by local issues and competition for resources rather than regional or ideological rivalries."" With none of the parties looking beyond Yemen's borders, the conflict had no regional let alone global implications. Even the players were not easily categorized. The Jamestown Foundation's James Brandon wrote that each side was a coalition incorporating ""a wide range of both Sunni and Shia elements. Self-interest, and not sectarian affiliation, is therefore the driving force behind much of the ongoing violence."" Riyadh has turned a tragic though commonplace power struggle into a sectarian proxy fight, encouraging Tehran to respond in kind.The KSA has wrapped itself in international law, claiming that it wants to restore Hadi to power. But his followers largely abandoned him after he fled into exile and endorsed Saudi airstrikes on his fellow citizens. Killing people generally is not a good way to rally the public to your cause. Only a Saudi occupation could sustain him in power. Yemen requires a negotiated settlement, which Riyadh has done nothing to promote. Yemen's political turbulence is largely irrelevant to the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken argued that America's ally, Saudi Arabia, was ""sending a strong message to the Houthis and their allies that they cannot overrun Yemen by force."" But it doesn't much matter to anyone outside of Yemen if they do. Whoever rules Sana'a will neither challenge Saudi primacy nor block Gulf shipping. America's only serious security concern is the al-Qaeda affiliate, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). But the Houthis hate AQAP as much as they dislike America. Unfortunately, AQAP has gained in the chaos, to which Saudi Arabia has greatly contributed: Defense Secretary Ashton Carter worried about the group's ""great gains."" But a Houthi-led government cannot be expected to combat AQAP while under attack by Riyadh.Secretary Kerry sounded like a late-night comedian when he announced that the U.S. was ""not going to stand by while the region is destabilized or while people engage in overt warfare across lines, international boundaries and other countries."" Washington engages in such behavior regularly, and the KSA is the region's most malignant player. Indeed, on any normal measure, Riyadh is far more inimical to American interests than Iran. You wouldn't know that from American policy. Normal countries have constitutional monarchies in which the nominal heads of state are tourist attractions. Saudi Arabia is a totalitarian theocratic gerontocracy in which a handful of elderly brothers and their sons rule over nearly 30 million people while looting the country's wealth on behalf of a few thousand princes. It's great work if you can find it.King Abdullah recently died and Western leaders swiftly abased themselves, painting the autocrat as a great humanitarian and liberal, even someone who encouraged greater ""tolerance"" and sought ""sincere dialogue"" among different religions -- none of which can be practiced legally in his nation. His successor, King Salman, appears determined to extinguish what tiny fires of reform Abdullah lit while fighting an aggressive war against his nation's southern neighbor.In contrast to Kuwait and even Iran, there are no elections, political opposition or dissenting viewpoints in Saudi Arabia. The royals once explained that elections were ""not consistent with our Islamic creed."" No doubt. The eruption of the Arab Spring was met with generous social spending and ruthless repression. At the time, said Saudi Interior Minister Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz: ""What we won by the sword we will keep by the sword."" Anyone who voices criticism is treated as if he was in the Soviet Union. The State Department's latest human rights assessment noted that ""citizens lack the right and legal means to change their government; pervasive restrictions on universal rights such as freedom of expression, including on the internet, and freedom of assembly, association, movement and religion, and a lack of equal rights for women, children and noncitizen workers."" The report went on to cite ""torture and other abuses; overcrowding in prisons and detention centers; holding political prisoners and detainees; denial of due process; arbitrary arrest and detention; and arbitrary interference with privacy, home and correspondence."" Last summer the regime sentenced blogger Raif Badawi to 1,000 lashes and ten years in prison; he now faces a possible retrial for apostasy and the death penalty. The Saudis later imposed a 15-year term on his lawyer, Waleed Abul-Khair, for ""undermining the regime and officials"" and ""inciting public opinion.""The KSA is even more restrictive when it comes to religious liberty. For instance, the Saudis long have underwritten the intolerant Wahhabist theology around the world, including in America. Wahhabism is hostile to modernity and creates a theological environment conducive to extremism and terrorism. The royals feign piety through such activities, which enables them to live licentiously when they escape abroad at their people's great expense.Spiritual oppression is complete. Not one church, synagogue, temple, or other house of worship operates in the KSA. Gathering together privately in a home is enough for arrest. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom observed that ""Saudi Arabia remains unique in the extent to which it restricts the public expression of any religion other than Islam."" Nor are Muslims exempt, since Saudi Arabia is a Sunni theocracy.The State Department reported simply: ""Freedom of religion is neither recognized nor protected under the law and the government severely restricted it in practice."" School textbooks encourage intolerance, including ""justification for the social exclusion and killing of Islamic minorities and 'apostates'."" The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevent of Vice, which employs the Mutawaa'in, or religious police, continues to enforce religious law. King Abdullah made the force slightly more accountable; King Salman seems likely to move in the opposite direction.The KSA's international policies are equally bad. Saudi Arabia was one of just three governments to recognize the Afghan Taliban (America's loyal ally Pakistan was another one). Saudis generously funded Saudi Osama bin-Laden and his al-Qaeda prior to 9/11, which forced the KSA to crack down. (The Bush administration not only spirited Saudi nationals out of the country afterwards, but apparently hid details of Saudi support for terrorism.) Fifteen of the 19 9/11 terrorists were Saudis.Although al-Qaeda's later attack on the royals spurred the regime to crack down, the Kingdom's malign role continues. A 2009 Wikileaks document indicated that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged that ""Donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide."" In Syria the Saudi government has financed and supplied extremist Syrian rebels, perhaps including the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, and apparently even the Islamic State, at least before the U.S. intervened. In neighboring Bahrain Riyadh sent in troops to back the repressive Sunni monarchy -- essentially the Khalifa family dictatorship -- which sits atop a Shia majority. The KSA also bullies its Gulf neighbors, which tend to be more liberal in both political and religious affairs. Saudi Arabia did discover the limits of its influence when Pakistan rejected Riyadh's request for military involvement in Yemen. As the U.S. long ago discovered, even generous financial support results in little gratitude, at least when it comes to joining a no-win war.Despite the horrid Saudi record, Washington rarely says a critical word. Indeed, while the U.S. criticizes other nations for violating religious liberty, the State Department routinely suspends the KSA's well-deserved designation as a Country of Particular Concern. And the word democracy rarely passed the lips of U.S. officials. One unnamed official once declared: ""They're not in a mode for listening."" At least the administration criticized Riyadh's treatment of Badawi.However, far more often U.S. officials have celebrated their friendship with the Saudi royals, inviting Saudi kings to intimate tete-a-tetes at secluded presidential retreats. President George H.W. Bush called then-Crown Prince Abdullah a ""dear friend and partner."" Most important, Washington has routinely lent the Saudis the U.S. military. President Jimmy Carter declared the Persian Gulf to be a vital American interest. President Ronald Reagan armed the Saudis over Israeli opposition. President Bush fought the first Gulf War as much to safeguard the KSA as liberate Kuwait and left a garrison later targeted by the 1996 Khobar Towers barracks bombing. Now, President Barack Obama is holding the Saudi royals' coats as they intervene in the Yemeni civil war. At least Washington so far has not complied with Riyadh's demand that America oust President Bashar al-Assad, who threatens U.S. interests less than does the KSA. But the Saudis and their allies may yet find a way to maneuver America into that war as well.Ironically, Riyadh resembles the Islamic State more than the U.S. or any other American ally. Freedom is to be feared. Women are objects of discrimination. Heads are routinely lopped off as punishment. Only the orange jump suits and horrid YouTube videos are missing.U.S. policymakers have sold American values for a pittance largely because of oil. However, that never was an adequate reason to support medieval theocracy. The Saudi royals always needed to sell their oil to fund their brutal repression and lavish lifestyles. Cut off the funds and there is no one to clean up for them or protect them. Even more so would a successor regime need the money. Moreover, U.S. reliance on foreign supplies, in what always has been a global market, is down dramatically with the discovery or new oil fields and development of new sources of oil. Yet the one-way relationship continues. President Obama praised the late King Abdullah's ""steadfast and passionate belief in the importance of the U.S.-Saudi relationship as a force for stability and security in the Middle East."" Of course the royals believe in the ""alliance."" It's cheaper to borrow U.S. forces than hire bodyguards.But that might not be enough in the future. The royal system's vulnerabilities are only likely to grow. A handful of elderly kleptocrats, fearful of free expression and liberal thought, are ill-equipped to guide a nation with an increasingly youthful and restless population into a tempestuous future. As the Shah of Iran discovered 36 years ago, at some point oil and repression aren't enough to preserve authoritarian injustice. Hopefully Washington will not have earned the same dubious reputation with the Saudi people once they are free. The danger of making a pact with the devil, as America has done with Riyadh, is that you risk being locked in the devil's embrace, like in Yemen.This post first appeared at American Spectator online."

Based on that book and that methodology, Osterwalder founded Strategyzer, a software company that helps businesses reinvent themselves. His vision is to create the SAP of strategy by delivering the necessary tools, processes and software to aid with strategy and innovation design. Osterwalder has written several bestselling books, Business Model Generation and Value Proposition Design that highlight business model change and product market fit. Dr. Alex Osterwalder, Author and CEO of StrategyzerSays Dr. Osterwalder: Business model innovation and new value propositions are very relevant topics because business models expire like yogurt in the fridge. It's a competitive world out there, so there is no stopping anymore. Osterwalder's mission is to help companies innovate with the best tools using sound business models and value propositions. In order to better understand his vision and mission, I asked Osterwalder to provide a high-level overview of business model innovation and value proposition definitions and concepts. What is a business model?  A business model is the blueprint of your strategy. Your strategy tells you where you want to go, and the business model tells you how you are going to do that. Osterwalder is a world renowned expert at helping companies develop a visual description of how you create, deliver, and capture value.What are the components of a business model? Osterwalder and his team created the Business Model Canvas, a very pragmatic and visual business tool that allows companies to address nine important questions to describe the business model. The business model asks questions like: Who are you targeting -- customer segment? What value are you creating -- value proposition? How do you reach this market -- channels to customer? What kind of relationship will you establish -- transactional or long-term? What are you deliverables -- products and services? How will you deliver value? What are you customers willing to pay -- revenue streams? Answering these questions -- five components -- will establish the front stage of how companies create value. After knowing your target audience and your value proposition, then you are ready to focus on the 'how' and the 'backstage' components of the business model.  With the backstage, you're going to ask yourself, okay I know who I'm targeting and what I'm delivering, how am I going to do it? Now the focus is key resources, assets, and factories, and the brand. How are you going to do it? Why is business model innovation so important?  Today, business models expire must faster. Osterwalder points out that business models - what you do, how you do it, and the value you deliver -- can vary within the same industry. ""Let us take the music industry. Apple was one company that started disrupting that, then came Spotify, and you had the record majors that are trying to figure out how to do things. So business models today, expire much faster than they ever did before and in one particular industry you'll find multiple different business models,"" says Osterwalder. Understanding the right business model for your industry is increasingly important. Osterwalder points out to Apple as a company that extends beyond one industry -- they are in software, hardware, content, etc. Basically it is the business model that matters, not the industry anymore. What is the blueprint of your strategy? That's why business models start to matter because there are many more choices than before. What is the Business Model Canvas?  The Business Model Canvas is a way of visually representing business models with nine questions or nine building blocks. The business model canvas establishes a shared language, a practical language that executives and entrepreneurs could use to describe their business model. The canvas has been tested by millions of people and it helps them to describe, collaborate and test their business models. The Business Model Canvas How do you use the Business Model Canvas?  There is no right or wrong way to use the business model canvas. A recent blog highlighted the ""14 ways to use the Business Model Canvas"". There is broad applicability with the canvas, allowing companies to use the tool to managing existing businesses or to create new ones. All organizations have business models and they are vary to a certain degree, so every kind of function in a business will have the flexibility to define and adapt based on the 9 building block elements.   Osterwalders has advice to startups and their business models. ""Admit that when you start out, uncertainty is at its maximum. You don't know what's going to work, in particular when you are trying something radically you know, and you need to admit that, which means you're not going to execute an idea. You're actually going to search for the right business models and the right value propositions to bring that idea to market. To turn that vision of what you think could be done into a strategic and complete blueprint."" Says Osterwalder. Osterwalder encourages companies to reduce uncertainty with small experiments, tests, and prototypes in order to capture evidence. Do not invest in ideas without evidence. Ideas don't matter, is turning that idea into concrete value proposition and business models that you can prove with evidence that they are going to work. That's the hard part, and then you execute it. The ideas don't really matter at all.What do large companies need to know about business model change? Osterwalder believes that larger more established companies need to create an innovation space, which is in addition to what they already have, and in that space the rules and incentives are totally different. The processes and the types of people that need to succeed are also different. The creation of a second space to accelerate innovation is a challenge.That second culture, that second space needs to be deeply integrated with the execution space -- the execution engine as some like to call it. It needs to be a partnership, you need to have a dual culture that works hand-in-hand. That's very tough to do.Osterwalder also believes that a lean approach is key to success. ""An entrepreneur and a business model innovator should never start with a huge team and a huge budget, because you will waste the money; you will blow it."" You want to start small and increase that, but it means you need to give your innovators really a seat at the top table, and I like to be really provocative and say, hey, what if we created the Chief Corporate Entrepreneur, who has just as much power as the CEO and he or she reports to the board? You're creating a space where people can innovate with real power to create the future for the company. What is digital transformation? Osterwalder's simple and profound definition of digital transformation is based on this question: ""How are we going to use the new technologies today that exist to better value propositions and better business models. Don't just focus on the digital aspects, but also focus on the value propositions that we create, but focus on the business models that create value for the company. So digital transformation is a combination of innovation, value proposition, innovation business models, and innovation in processes. It's the whole aspect of transforming on the basis of the digital tools that exist today.Why does digital transformation require a business model change?  Osterwalder believes that a lot of the things that are possible today require very different processes, very different ways of working. You can do things today that you couldn't do five years or maybe a decade ago. To create new types of value propositions. And change doesn't come easily to anybody, right. So the difficulty is, in addition to this execution engine that you built - which is very good, you need to be lean and cut costs to produce efficiently. In addition to that you need to open up and say okay, well some things are new, some things are different what if we experimented in that space and experimentation is never lean. Experimentation always requires a culture where you can fail, where failure is a good thing to do because you are going to learn and you're going to change.What is a value proposition?The value proposition is the story of how you are addressing jobs, pains, and gains that matter to the customers. Your value proposition describes how your products and services, or how you intend you know to create value for your customer with your products and services. The value proposition is never your products and services alone; it's how they address the things that matter to your customers. So it's the story of how your helping you're customer succeed. Value Proposition Design What is product market fit? Product market fit is when you get traction with your value proposition. You might have something great on paper that you came up with in your meeting room, looks like a brilliant idea because your best marketers, your best engineers you know came up with it and it just seems obvious that this is going to work. Said Osterwlader ""When your value proposition gets traction, that's when you have product market share. The journey from taking an idea, conceptualizing it in a value proposition, and then testing it until the right fit between products and services, and the jobs, pains and gains of your customers."" Says Osterwalder.Our conversation with Osterwalder concluded with a discussion around disruptive innovation and industry disruptors like Uber.What's amazing is they have relatively little physical assets. You know you take a taxi company as a comparison, the business model is night and day. Where they actually get others to do the work in their business model and the use other companies or other people's assets. Osterwalder's advice is to not neglect the companies that do have assets. ""The most successful company in the world is Apple today and they are not just this kind of digital platform. It is one component of what they do, but they do have a lot of physical assets, and a lot of workers around the world, and that's not likely to change. They're not going to move towards you know a much lighter and more scalable model. There is always dangerous to say that there is this type of business model that is right or wrong,"" said Osterwlader. Innovation will always give you new models in spaces where you would have never expected them and that could be you know, asset heavy or asset light. The challenge is you not always to question the fundamental assumptions and 'Okay, these companies have done it well that way. "

It is just 300 kilometres from the Italian island of Lampedusa, which many migrants fleeing poverty and conflict aim for as their gateway to Europe.

At the stadium or watching the game on TV, when the pads collide, and we hear that ""pop,"" our juices get flowing. We ""ooh"" and we ""ahh,"" we say ""wow"" and ""did you see that hit?"" The crowd goes crazy, and we want more.Injuries have always been a part of the game, but one we have accepted. Players got hurt, they came back, and the hits just kept coming. And we keep on cheering.But what happens if the big hits cause players to retire while still in the prime of their careers? It would start the NFL on a slippery slope that could be its downfall.That, my friends, is exactly the slippery slope that we are on.The situation involving the retired players is well-documented, as they are seeking financial reimbursement for the medical problems that were left untreated during their playing days. The poor behavior, the suicides, you all know about it by now.Motivated in part by the retirees' situation or not, the retirements have come quickly during this 2015 off-season. Yesterday, 49ers' right tackle Anthony Davis announced his retirement, although he states he might come back after ""a year or so."" Davis marks the fourth member of the 49ers to call it quits, joining Patrick Willis, Chris Borland and Justin Smith.Patrick Willis noticeably was affected by the plight of retired players:Honestly, I pay attention to guys when they're finished playing, walking around like they've got no hips and they can't play with their kids. They can barely walk... People see that and they feel sorry, but they don't realize it's because he played a few extra years.Chris Borland held similar concerns:I just thought to myself, 'What am I doing? Is this how I'm going to live my adult life, banging my head, especially with what I've learned and knew about the dangers?'This week, it spread to the Titans, when Colin McCarthy announced his retirement. He too had injury problems in recent years, which no doubt led to his decision to leave the game.It's not hard to understand these decisions made by NFL players. The effects that the game has had have been severe, highly publicized and in some cases, deadly. We have seen players that have committed suicide, and in the case of Dave Duerson, making sure their brains are intact so the effects of football can be studied, and players can be protected in the future.Players want to have a life when they leave the game. They don't want their brains to be turned to mush. Seeing what has happened, it's easy to understand these players' points of view.But what does it mean for the game? If the best players in the sport are going to retire during the prime of their careers, where is the game headed? It is headed down a very slippery slope, which by the nature of the sport, is inevitable. Can anything be done? It's hard to say.All we can do is enjoy our favorite players while we can, because may not be in the NFL as long as we hope."
