I've known a lot of politicians in my career, and interviewed many of them. But none has had a stronger and more memorable impact on me than my time with Mario.Back in 1988, I was the Executive Producer of a statewide television newsmagazine called BROADCAST: New York. Mostly, I was behind the scenes. But the one on-camera role that I performed was the quarterly interview with then Governor Cuomo. Our conversations on camera were topical, and engaged -- he never asked to see questions in advance, and sat for a 30-minute interview that we then cut down to six or seven minutes on air. He never ducked hard questions, never engaged in political double speak, and was always warm and engaging with all the members of the team. He genuinely liked people, and liked the young and somewhat unconventional news crew that was producing what was a the time a pretty edgy newsmagazine outside the the standard confines of local news.In one of our more memorable conversations, I asked him how hard it must be to see all the issues in the State that he was responsible for, but couldn't always solve. I mentioned driving from New York City to Albany, and seeing burned-out cars by the side of the road near Harlem.His answer was -- predictably -- not what you would expect from a politician. He explained that he was an avid reader of the Jesuit priest-philosopher-scientist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and as such had come to terms with the fact that you can only do the best work you are able, and believe that the world is moving toward a better place. It was hardly a political answer, and one I've remembered every day since.As our conversations become more informal, he took to joking with me -- making fun of the tie I wore, or the nature of how we'd set up the cameras to get his good side. As the 1992 Presidential Campaign heated up -- he seemed to flirt with the idea of running. And, I remember being in Washington, D.C. the day that he announced, at a press conference with the helicopter fueled and ready to whisk him to New Hampshire to declare his candidacy, that he would not run. It was for me, the first profoundly disappointing moment in my young political life. After that day -- the question of why was a popular cocktail party conversation. But despite the rumors and the guesswork, it hardly mattered. He was a towering intellect, and a warm and genuine person. And he would have been a towering figure on the national stage.For the last number of years, he's taken himself out of the spotlight -- allowing his son to bring what is now very much a classic Cuomo cadence to New York political scene. That he died on the same day that Andrew was inaugurated for his second term is both poetic and at the same time painful. I remember our crew baking cookies with Matilda and talking about the importance of mentorship -- long before that concept had become a mainstream idea. They were an extraordinary political couple, and the magic of his intellect and his humanity will be missed.Perhaps de Chardin said it best: ""We are one, after all, you and I, together we suffer, together exist and forever will recreate each other."""

He has pleaded not guilty to all 30 charges against him.Tsarnaev, due to be in court on Monday, is accused of detonating a pair of homemade bombs placed amid a crowd of thousands of spectators at the race's finish line on April 15, 2013. PHOTOS: He was arrested four days after the bombing. Prosecutors say he and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, his 26-year-old brother, later shot and killed a university police officer. The brother died after a wild gunbattle with police.Some 1,200 prospective jurors have been summoned to U.S. District Court in Boston. Judge George O'Toole will seek to winnow down that field to a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates to hear a trial expected to last three to five months.Tsarnaev's attorneys had sought to have the proceedings moved out of Boston. They argued it would be impossible to find an impartial jury because of intense news coverage and the fact that thousands of people attended the race or hid in their homes during a day-long lockdown in the greater Boston area after the bombing.Experts said it will be virtually impossible to find jurors unaware of the basic details of the bombing, which has already been the subject of two trials of friends of the younger Tsarnaev who were found guilty of interfering with the investigation into the attack.""This case presents unique difficulty in terms of seating a jury that will be able to analyze the case fairly,"" said former federal prosecutor Thomas Peisch, an attorney with the Boston law firm Conn Kavanaugh. ""This incident is seared into the consciousness of people who live in Massachusetts.""O'Toole's goal will be to find jurors able to commit to determining Tsarnaev's fate solely on the evidence they hear in court, Peisch said.Another challenge will be finding jurors not entirely opposed to the death penalty, which is banned under Massachusetts state law but applies in this case because Tsarnaev faces federal charges.""You can have people who are against the death penalty but are willing to vote for it in specific cases,"" said Boston College Law School professor Robert Bloom. ""They can't be stringent in their opposition to the death penalty, but if they said they could vote for it in certain circumstances, he could pick them.""The Tsarnaev brothers were Muslim ethnic Chechens whose family emigrated to the United States about a decade before the attack, settling in Cambridge, Massachusetts, just outside Boston. According to prosecutors, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev wrote messages inside of the hull of the drydocked boat where he was discovered hiding four days after the attack indicating the attack was politically motivated.The messages included ""the U.S. government is killing our innocent civilians"" and ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished,"" according to court papers.His lawyers are expected to argue Tsarnaev acted under the influence of his brother, a boxer also suspected of having a role in a 2011 triple murder in Waltham, Massachusetts.Three people died in the bombing: restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29; graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23; and Martin Richard, 8.

I challenge my attendees to make the best board they can with what they have right now in this moment. I constantly remind them that there is no mistakes, no right way to do it. Just create without rules.Mistake #2. Being embarrassed by setting big goals. Just like the toddlers with the bag of random items. If what they are creating doesn't work, they find another way, and another way and another way. Don't be embarrassed by putting weight loss on your board if you know you have gained some unhealthy weight due to being an emotional eater. Be honest with yourself and be free.Mistake #3. Just putting things on the board with no intention of working towards the goal is not cool. Using the example in Mistake #2. The vision may be for you to lose weight. The goal is to put your inspiration up of healthy meals and healthy images and words that reflect your vision for getting healthy and losing the weight. Be specific on how much weight you want to lose. Looking at salad on your post board every morning may not motivate you, but looking at a salad next to a picture of nice fit body or a picture of yourself when you were fit and healthy just might trigger some energy. The more specific you are the better. Pick images that will trigger an emotion into an action.

(AP Photo/Evan Agostini, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e2ad2000000f0201d6a1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recent Supreme Court decisions and ongoing fights in public schools over the display of religious symbols indicate that one of the nation's oldest debates endures. The separation of church and state remains an ideal whose contention speaks to a perennial crisis for the United States: reconciling a secular democracy with a deeply religious citizenry. Navigating a secular public square rife with religious fervor is perhaps most carefully done by those responsible for governing them. At least, that is ideally the case. Public officials of all kinds are notoriously inconsistent when it comes to the separation of church and state. They consistently, however, have opinions on the matter. The recent passing of former Governor Mario Cuomo of New York offered a solemn opportunity to revisit one of the best articulations of this treacherous balancing act that most legislators face. In a lecture titled ""Religious Belief and Public Morality: A Catholic Governor's Perspective"" given at the University of Notre Dame in 1984, Governor Cuomo laid out a deeply nuanced take on the role of religion in the governance of a diverse constituency. Said the governor, ""The Catholic public official lives the political truth most Catholics through most of American history have accepted and insisted on: the truth that to assure our freedom we must allow others the same freedom, even if occasionally it produces conduct by them which we would hold to be sinful."" Governor Cuomo continued, ""We know that the price of seeking to force our beliefs on others is that they might some day force theirs on us."" The governor's remarks were focused on the issue of abortion--a topic of great concern to many Americans then, as it remains today. Beyond their topical context, however, Governor Cuomo's remarks ought to be commemorated for their greater political context. Speaking at a university that continues to make headlines for its conservative take on birth control, Governor Cuomo's expression of liberal Catholicism was a direct challenge to an increasingly powerful religious lobby that sought to incorporate its normative set of religious values into daily political deliberations. Although mentioning him only once, Governor Cuomo's take on governing the public square as a religious politician was in complete odds with the vision espoused by Rev. Jerry Falwell--leader of the Moral Majority. Arguably responsible for creating the ""Religious Right,"" Falwell envisioned the very offices that Governor Cuomo occupied as the last stand for a national moral code in which religion took center stage. Falwell was no stranger to the political limelight; President Reagan had benefited greatly from the Moral Majority's politicking, and had reciprocated the help with open arms for Falwell in the White House. It is this context that makes Governor Cuomo's remarks especially valuable for discourse today involving gay marriage, birth control, and other issues in which public officeholders find themselves weighing religious scruples against political exigencies. In a political environment in which religion is a calling card exercised by conservatives, liberal legislators can take a note or two from the logic manifest in Governor Cuomo's lecture. Religion need not imply a normative take on politics. Conversely, as Governor Cuomo demonstrated, honoring the American tradition of religious freedom as a pious politician means enabling other individuals to exercise their faith (or lack thereof) as they see fit. In this sense, Governor Cuomo's words from 30 years ago remain an exceedingly relevant lesson in the fine line that politicians often find themselves straddling between piety and proselytizing. While some see public office as a pulpit from which to act upon a normative set of religious ideals, the legacy of Governor Cuomo reminds us that others see public office as a means to enable Americans to thrive in their spirituality."

Mario Cuomo following his death on Thursday (Jan. 1) at 82, some of the loudest praise is coming from liberal Catholics for the brand of moral and political seriousness that Cuomo brought to public life.The reaction was understandable: Cuomo, whose son Andrew was sworn in for his second term as the state's governor the same day as his father's death, was the Democratic Party's most engaging defender of classic liberal policies and an eloquent promoter of Catholic social justice teachings.The son of Italian immigrants who worked his way up society's ladder, the elder Cuomo repeatedly invoked his Catholic faith and his church's doctrines to advance policies ensuring that others would have the same chance, and that if they didn't, they would not be abandoned.Cuomo was also just as famous for elaborating a rationale by which Catholic politicians like himself could be personally opposed to abortion but could still support and defend a legal right to abortion. Cuomo's nuanced position was seen as key to allowing Catholics who support abortion rights — mainly Democrats — to run for office without continually running afoul of the Catholic hierarchy, or alienating Catholic voters.Yet even as these ""Cuomo Catholics"" grieve for the great orator who was the Democrats' greatest foil to Ronald Reagan, they may want to consider whether Cuomo's moral calculus has come back to haunt them. Now, a new generation of Catholics conservatives — mainly Republicans — invoke the same kind of ""personally opposed"" ethos to part ways with their church on issues like economic and foreign policy, the death penalty and immigration reform.Indeed, Catholic GOP leaders and their intellectual allies have repeatedly used the principle of ""prudential judgment"" — that is, using one's best ideas as to what policies would best achieve desired ends — to argue that while they respect the bishops, prelates should not be telling politicians what to do, or how to do their job.That was the central takeaway from Cuomo's 1984 address on religion and public life at the University of Notre Dame, a lecture that is a cornerstone of his legacy as a Catholic politician. It was, as Washington Post columnist (and proud liberal Catholic) E.J. Dionne wrote, ""the liberal Catholic Speech Heard Round the World.""1984: A key year for politicians and prelates alike  At the time, Cuomo was in his first term as governor and was engaged in a fierce running battle with Catholic leaders — mainly the outspoken archbishop of New York, Cardinal John O'Connor — over whether you could be a good Catholic and still support Roe v. Wade.The issue was emerging with particular force as the Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion was becoming settled law, and also a cornerstone of the Democratic agenda.At the same time, the Catholic hierarchy was taking a decidedly more conservative turn under Pope John Paul II. Abortion was the salient issue for the U.S. bishops, a nonnegotiable point that no Catholic pol could ignore if he wanted to stay in the good graces of the bishops, or, in the view of some, be eligible to take Communion.Cuomo's fellow New Yorker and Italian Catholic, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, had just made history as Walter Mondale's running mate, and she also supported abortion rights. It was left to Cuomo to provide a Catholic intellectual defense against her many critics.""(W)hile we always owe our bishops' words respectful attention and careful consideration, the question whether to engage the political system in a struggle to have it adopt certain articles of our belief as part of public morality, is not a matter of doctrine: it is a matter of prudential political judgment,"" Cuomo said in the landmark Notre Dame speech.Cuomo even anticipated conservatives' adoption of his stance when he asked if he would have to follow the bishops' teaching on economic justice ""even if I am an unrepentant supply sider?"" And he pointedly quoted Michael Novak, known as the Catholic ""theologian of capitalism,"" who wrote: ""Religious judgment and political judgment are both needed. But they are not identical.""The speech was supposed to defend Cuomo-style Catholics and perhaps find some common ground for a truce in the emerging intra-Catholic culture wars.But the reactions, both positive and negative, were so ""explosive,"" as Dionne put it, that it only exacerbated the debate. Liberals saw it as the final word, while conservatives saw it as the creed of ""cafeteria Catholicism,"" a red flag to rally more passionate opposition.A legacy that will outlive Cuomo  Ironically, Cuomo's vision may have won out since nearly all Catholic politicians are cafeteria Catholics now — picking and choosing which Catholic teachings they want to highlight.Yet at least two critical differences should not be overlooked in the post-mortems:First, throughout the Notre Dame speech, Cuomo was clear, repeatedly and insistently, that he supported church teachings against abortion and even contraception. It's hard to envision many Catholic Democrats — or even many Republicans — doing either today.Second, Cuomo was also clear that outside of a legal ban on abortion — which he argued could actually be counterproductive — he wanted to find ways to reduce abortions, a position that even Democrats who used to invoke the ""safe, legal and rare"" mantra now seem disinclined to deploy.In reality, the so-called ""social issues"" agenda that features opposition to (or support for) issues like abortion and gay rights are not working for either party. Instead, they are giving way to arguments over economics where the roles are reversed: Conservatives argue for less government control, and liberals argue for greater state intervention.Yet Cuomo was also a relic, in some respects, in arguing that American society could not ignore the moral aspects and ramifications of either the economy or personal behavior.In his Notre Dame speech, he specifically cited the ""seamless garment"" argument of then-Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, arguing that Catholics in public office, both conservative and liberal, are challenged to protect and foster life at all stages.Bernardin's legacy would be eclipsed soon after Cuomo's own political career ended — Bernardin died in 1996, two years after Cuomo left office — yet it has actually made an unlikely comeback under Pope Francis, who is clear that Catholic teaching on economic justice, immigration and war and peace cannot be separated from Catholic doctrine on abortion, and in fact need to be preached more vigorously.The difference is that when the pope makes his first U.S. visit in September, he will have no obvious choir to preach to, as John Paul and Benedict XVI did. Instead, his views will face a tough sell with the faithful in both parties.Mario Cuomo is dead, yes. But ""Cuomo Catholicism"" will likely long outlast him."

""It's cloudy, making it difficult for the cameras to detect.""Divers, including a team of Russian specialists who just arrived in Pangkalan Bun, may be able to investigate the suspected wreckage on Sunday if the weather improves, officials said. NO SURVIVORSNo survivors have been found from the crash, which happened about 40 minutes after the plane took off from Indonesia's second largest city in an area known for intense tropical thunderstorms during the current monsoon season.A report from Indonesia's weather bureau said it was likely the plane had flown into bad weather which would have been difficult to avoid, and that it was possible this had caused ice to form on its engines.""Based on the available data on the last received location of the aircraft, the weather was a factor in causing the accident,"" the weather bureau said.Indonesian authorities on Friday questioned whether the pilot had followed correct weather procedures, and later suspended Indonesia AirAsia's Surabaya to Singapore flights, saying the airline's operating license only permitted flights on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.Djoko Murdjatmodjo, Indonesia's acting Director General of Air Transportation, said on Saturday that the Transport Ministry would investigate other routes used by the carrier, which flies from at least 15 Indonesian destinations.""We are going to investigate all AirAsia flight schedules. Hopefully we can start on next Monday,"" he said. ""It is possible AirAsia's license in Indonesia might be revoked,"" he added.Sunu Widyatmoko, Indonesia AirAsia chief, told reporters the airline, which is 49-percent owned by Malaysia-based AirAsia , would cooperate with the inquiry.""The government has suspended our flights from Surabaya to Singapore and back,"" he said. ""They are doing the evaluation process. AirAsia will cooperate fully with the evaluation.""Much effort has focused on finding the mostly Indonesian victims of the crash. Thirty bodies have been recovered from the sea, although rescue official Supriyadi, who like many Indonesians uses just one name, said it was unlikely more would be found floating.""Because we're already in the seventh day ... the chances are they have all sunk,"" he said. ""There's a possibility they'll be found on beaches.""Small pieces of the aircraft and other debris have also been found, but there has been no sign of the crucial voice and flight data recorders - the so-called black boxes that investigators hope will unravel the sequence of events in the cockpit during the doomed jet's final minutes. WEATHER FACTORThe cause of the crash, the first fatal accident suffered by the AirAsia group, remains unexplained.The plane was flying at 32,000 ft (9,753 meters) and the pilot had asked to climb to 38,000 ft just before contact was lost. When air traffic controllers granted permission to fly at 34,000 ft a few minutes later there was no response.A source close to the investigation said radar data appeared to show the aircraft made an ""unbelievably"" steep climb before it crashed, possibly pushing it beyond the A320's limits.Hadi Mustofa Djuraid, a transport ministry official, told reporters on Friday that authorities were also investigating the possibility that the pilot did not ask for a weather report from the meteorological agency at the time of take-off.Indonesia AirAsia said in a statement that weather reports were printed in hard copy at the operations control center at all its flight hubs, including Surabaya, and taken by the pilot to the aircraft before each flight.An AirAsia spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the pilot had followed the procedure described in the statement.(Additional reporting by Adriana Nina Kusuma, Cindy Silviana, Kanupriya Kapoor, Michael Taylor, Charlotte Greenfield and Nicholas Owen in JAKARTA; Writing by Alex Richardson; Editing by Michael Perry and Raissa Kasolowsky)"

Ballet to the People caught up with Wendy Whelan, Carla Körbes, Paloma Herrera, Xiomara Reyes, and Julie Kent to ask: What in your view has been the most significant change in the dance world since you started out as a young dancer. How would you counsel a young dancer who is just starting out?  Wendy Whelan left Louisville, Kentucky, as a teenager to attend the School of American Ballet then spent her entire career at New York City Ballet. ""... [A]n ideally modern woman, dancing with men as if part of a team, together on equal terms,"" says The New York Times of her qualities as a ballerina. This modern woman acknowledges:I'm from a very different generation. There were the giant choreographers - Martha Graham, George Balanchine, Merce Cunningham, Trisha Brown - who were creating huge volumes of work... I came in at the tail end of the Balanchine [era], surrounded by his dancers.  Brazilian-born Carla Körbes also trained at SAB and started her career at New York City Ballet, but spent the last decade at Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle. Her interpretive power astonishes, from the delicate airiness of her partnership with Karel Cruz in the central slow movement of Alexei Ratmansky's Concerto DSCH to her haunting, feverish Sleepwalker in George Balanchine's La Sonnambula. Though only 33, she has witnessed a sea change in the dance world: Thanks to technology, dancers today have a much wider view of the dance world than when I first moved to New York. At age 14, coming to the U.S., all I knew was American Ballet Theatre, Baryshnikov, Nureyev, and some of the European companies. I barely knew anything about Balanchine. Today, dancers have so much more information, and are much more mobile. Kids are traveling everywhere to go to summer programs, funding themselves with Kickstarter - putting their dreams on the Internet and seeing if they will pan out.  Paloma Herrera, like Körbes, came to New York at a very young age. At 15, she was offered a contract with American Ballet Theatre, and, like Whelan, has spent her entire career with one company.  Even the most jaded ballet-goers rhapsodize over the luxurious unfolding of her leg in développé out of a supported pirouette, and in the articulation of her gloriously arched feet. While her passion onstage has hardly dimmed, she concedes: It's a new generation now, especially with the new media. I've danced with the most incredible partners, including Angel Corella, Jose Manuel Carreño, and Vladimir Malakhov - I loved that time, it was a golden era.  Cuba is very much on Xiomara Reyes' mind. A tiny dynamo whom Bachtrack describes as ""bringing sunshine wherever she goes,"" Reyes trained at Cuba's National Ballet School. For her, the recent defrosting of U.S.-Cuba relations is earthshaking: Anything that can mend a rip in our world is an Alleluia moment for me. The Cuban soul is very deeply hurt, and I believe it will be a long process of healing. This [announcement] is a step in that direction, I hope. For a Cuban dancer it means the opening of more choice and possibility, and that is of infinite value. She bids farewell to American Ballet Theatre after 14 years, before which she spent seven years with the Royal Ballet of Flanders. She, too, notes with ambivalence the rise of social media and its impact on the dance world:With Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other media, dancers have new opportunities to be noticed and, while I think these are wonderful outlets that give more people the opportunity to follow dancers whom they might never see perform live, I also believe it may be overwhelming for a young dancer who is trying to find her own voice. Social media can become a rat race. Dance is not only an external endeavor but also an internal search... Our need for exposure, this thirst for communication and public recognition, has a tendency to push us outward before we work inward. Recently dubbed by The Washington Post ""a font of regal beauty"" in the role of fairy queen Titania, Julie Kent will bow out in a final performance of Romeo and Juliet.  Looking back over her 29 seasons with American Ballet Theatre, she marvels at the sweeping social change:Perestroika. The end of the Cold War. The fall of Communism. The arrival of the Internet, cellular communications, social media and branding. All had great impact on society, the arts, the ballet world.  What's next for each of these ballerinas? Ballet to the People wanted to know. Wendy Whelan will crisscross the country with Restless Creature, a series of contemporary duets by four young choreographers, which premiered at Jacobs Pillow last summer then traveled to the Royal Opera House in London. Restless Creature's American tour starts in San Francisco in mid-January and winds up at the Joyce Theatre in New York in May. A new project with Edward Watson of the Royal Ballet will premiere in London in July. And a third piece of opera/dance theatre is simmering at the Brooklyn Academy of Music: an adaptation of the ancient Japanese Noh drama Hagoromo, about a celestial spirit whose magic power resides in a robe of feathers. Carla Körbes wraps up a splendidly varied season at PNB this spring then powers on to Vail again this summer. Her knee is getting better, she says, and she's excited to immerse herself in the festival. What would she like to dance? More Balanchine, if she had her wish! But she is also keen to work with new choreographers, found the experience working with Brian Brooks hugely inspiring. Retiring at this age, I'm still young and I'm excited. It's the end of company life for me, which gives me new options, frees me to do other things in the art world. Before I left City Ballet, at a time when I was struggling, I spoke with Eliot Feld, who told me: ""Leave when you're happy."" I never forgot this. I never take any of this for granted. Julie Kent will write a memoir, a book which she hopes will reflect her voice as an American dancer, a female artist, a passionate arts advocate, as well as a wife and a mother of two children. I have expressed myself without words for so long. The life of a ballerina seems so mysterious from afar, but the reality is that there are things that many people from different backgrounds and professions can connect with.Ballet to the People looks forward to her setting the record straight - after Darren Aronofsky's blood-and-feathers study in ballerina paranoia, the Black Swan horror flick.  Paloma Herrera bids American audiences Adieu with a final performance as Princess Aurora in Sleeping Beauty in June, but her Argentinian farewell comes later in the year. Globe-trotting balletomanes are prepared to travel long distances to catch her Tatiana in Onegin in October at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, a dramatic role she has long prized. After her final curtseys, she plans to indulge her love of theatre, of reading, and listening to music. Ballet has been my bubble, my life, my religion... Now I will enjoy this time in a different way. Xiomara Reyes will dance a final Giselle in May. Reflecting at this crossroad, she knows dance will continue to be an important part of her life: Dancing has been my life's journey ever since I can remember. I have found that to stand at the barre every morning is a kind of meditation, a spiritual experience.  Collectively, these five ballerinas have redefined virtuosity and grace for the art form in the 21st century - their natural gifts honed by artistic sensitivity and perseverance. No one is born to be a prima ballerina: it takes extraordinary discipline, acumen and gutsiness.Will one of them eventually take a leadership role in the ballet world? None of the five appear to have sought it out. One thing that has not changed over the span of these ballerinas' careers is the shortage of women at the helm of ballet companies. Karen Kain is now the longest-running incumbent artistic director of a major company, having run the National Ballet of Canada for ten years. Tamara Rojo took over English National Ballet two years ago. When Brigitte Lefèvre retired after a remarkable 19 years of steering Paris Opera Ballet in a bold, new direction, she was succeeded by Benjamin Millepied. In Britain, Monica Mason called the shots at the Royal Ballet for ten years, replaced by Kevin O'Hare in 2012. In America, Lourdes Lopez has been at the head of Miami City Ballet for just two years. As audiences for live theatre and dance continue to shrink, along with the public and private funding so critical to keeping these companies afloat, can new artistic leadership make a difference? Is it time for a reigning ballerina to be handed the reins?"

I have found that to stand at the barre every morning is a kind of meditation, a spiritual experience.  Collectively, these five ballerinas have redefined virtuosity and grace for the art form in the 21st century - their natural gifts honed by artistic sensitivity and perseverance. No one is born to be a prima ballerina: it takes extraordinary discipline, acumen and gutsiness.Will one of them eventually take a leadership role in the ballet world? None of the five appear to have sought it out. One thing that has not changed over the span of these ballerinas' careers is the shortage of women at the helm of ballet companies. Karen Kain is now the longest-running incumbent artistic director of a major company, having run the National Ballet of Canada for ten years. Tamara Rojo took over English National Ballet two years ago. When Brigitte Lefèvre retired after a remarkable 19 years of steering Paris Opera Ballet in a bold, new direction, she was succeeded by Benjamin Millepied. In Britain, Monica Mason called the shots at the Royal Ballet for ten years, replaced by Kevin O'Hare in 2012. In America, Lourdes Lopez has been at the head of Miami City Ballet for just two years. As audiences for live theatre and dance continue to shrink, along with the public and private funding so critical to keeping these companies afloat, can new artistic leadership make a difference? Is it time for a reigning ballerina to be handed the reins?"

Some commentators have viewed the use of this electronic delivery system for nicotine as a way for smokers to cut down on tobacco cigarettes or quit the habit altogether. Others have contended that e-cigarettes can be a ""gateway"" to smoking, and may actually increase the use of tobacco. Still others maintain that the jury is still out on the risks of nicotine inhaled through ""vaping."" And cases have been reported of young children ingesting the colorful nicotine liquids, posing serious risks to health and life.E-cigarettes: A danger in the making A new danger was revealed in an article in the New York Times on December 13: the unregulated manufacture of e-cigarettes in China poses significant health risks to consumers. The article notes that heavy metals, carcinogens and other dangerous compounds, such as lead, tin and zinc, have been detected in some e-cigarettes. The suspicion is that shoddy manufacturing practices contribute to this contamination.The article notes that more than 300 million e-cigarettes from China are expected to be shipped to the United States and Europe this year. Some of the Chinese manufacturing plants are legitimate operations that produce name brands, while others are operated by counterfeiters. The industry is entirely unregulated in China at present, and in the U.S. the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is moving slowly toward issuing rules that would require producers of e-cigarettes to provide details about ingredients and the manufacturing process.Who should regulate e-cigarettes? Despite the views of politicians who have strongly supported deregulation of industry in the United States, regulatory agencies exist to protect the health of the public. The FDA is responsible for overseeing the safety of many foods and all drugs, medical devices and biologicals; since 2009 the agency has also regulated the tobacco industry. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is in charge of monitoring the safety of meat, poultry and eggs. The Environmental Protection Agency has had the mandate to ensure safe drinking water in the country for the past 40 years. These agencies conduct activities that it would be impossible for consumers to carry out on their own. Without the scrutiny and actions of governmental regulatory agencies, public health would suffer a devastating blow.The need for speed This new information about risks posed by e-cigarettes from the manufacturing process underscores the need for the FDA to move swiftly. Recent studies have shown a significant rise in the use of e-cigarettes by high school students even as their use of tobacco cigarettes has declined. While such studies can help determine whether vaping increases, decreases or has no effect on the rate of tobacco consumption among young people, it is an open question whether the risks from poor manufacturing of e-cigarettes will reach the majority of users or prompt them to change their behavior.The wheels of bureaucracy grind slowly in Washington, but we can only hope that the FDA can meet this new challenge with timely action to regulate the importation of e-cigarettes containing ingredients that are known health hazards.This post was originally featured on The Doctor's Tablet, the blog of Albert Einstein College of Medicine."

Here, we highlight 10 trailblazers who made their mark and continue to do so through teaching, philanthropy, activism and inspiring second acts. They are sorted by their 2015 birthdates. JOHN G. ROBERTS, Jr., Supreme Court Chief Justice, January 27  John Roberts, the court’s second youngest member in a job with no retirement age, is likely to wield influence for many years if he is afforded the longevity of his predecessors. Since 2005, he has presided over an ideologically-divided court which has issued significant opinions on health care, campaign finance and gay rights. GARY SINISE, Actor, March 17   It's hard to say whether Gary Sinise is better known these days as an actor or a veterans' advocate. A stage performer who earned an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of troubled Vietnam veteran Lt. Dan in Forrest Gump, Sinise formed the real-life Lt. Dan Band to entertain troops abroad. Through those performances, he formed a close bond with veterans and founded the Gary Sinise Foundation to support military families and first responders. BARBARA KINGSOLVER, Author, April 8  Kingsolver, a biologist turned author, has written more than 14 books, mostly novels, including her best-known work The Poisonwood Bible. In 2000, she received the National Humanities Medal from President Bill Clinton. In 2005, she moved her family to a farm in Appalachia and attempted to subsist only on locally-produced foods for a year, an experiment she chronicled in her book Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life. In 2012, Kingsolver founded the Bellwether Prize, a $25,000 award for an unpublished novel promoting social change, as many of her books do.   ROSANNE CASH, Singer/Songwriter, May 25  The eldest daughter of Johnny Cash has been singing and composing music since she was a teenager. Her early career traced her father's country music roots, and later she crossed over into folk, rock and blues. Cash is also an author, having published her first collection of short stories in 1996. Over the years, she has survived substance abuse, vocal cord polyps and a rare brain illness. She continues to record and perform, releasing her latest album The River and the Thread and earning a Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award last year. IMAN - Model, July 25  The Somali supermodel who needs no last name, left modeling long ago to pursue other interests. After achieving international fame as a fashion model, she launched a line of affordable cosmetics and turned it into a $25 million business. Last year, she teamed up with model Naomi Campbell and modeling agent/activist Bethann Hardison to call out the fashion industry for failure to include more black models in their shows. She also supports a number of public health, child advocacy and relief organizations. She has been married to rock star David Bowie since 1992. EDWIN MOSES, Olympic Athlete, August 31  Edwin Moses won Olympic gold in the 400 meter hurdles twice, first in 1976 and again in 1984. He broke four world records and also won 122 consecutive races between 1977 and 1987. He helped develop drug-testing policies for track and field and, since 2000, has chaired the Laureus World Sports Academy, which promotes social change through sports. YO-YO MA, Musician, October 7   The world's most famous cellist, who played for President Kennedy as a boy, Ma is constantly taking on new projects and challenging himself to play even better. With 17 Grammys and a Presidential Medal of Freedom to his name, Ma might have retired to a life of leisure years ago. Instead, he continues to tour exhaustively and devotes time to his Silk Road Ensemble, a collaborative musical group he founded in 1998 to support a range of educational, artistic and cultural-exchange programs. BILL GATES, Entrepreneur, October 28  It may be hard to believe that the one-time whiz kid who made geek cool is turning 60. Gates, who famously dropped out of Harvard, founded Microsoft and became a billionaire by the time he was 32, has focused his second act on philanthropy. Through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, he and his wife have donated more than $31 billion to support numerous education, public health and anti-poverty initiatives.MARIA SHRIVER - Journalist, November 6   Born to the storied Kennedy family, Maria Shriver made her mark as a journalist. She left her job as an NBC News anchor before husband Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected California governor. As first lady, she continued to work on political and charitable causes. In 2009, her HBO film, ""The Alzheimer’s Project,"" won two Emmys. In 2011, she gracefully weathered public humiliation after it was discovered that Schwarzenegger had an affair and a child with a housekeeper. Shriver powered on, continuing with public appearances and supporting numerous causes including Alzheimer's caregiving and Special Olympics, the organization her mother founded. Last year, she published the Shriver Report, examining financial equity among women. BILL NYE, Science Educator, November 27  The mechanical engineer turned TV host popularized science as host of the PBS/Disney children's program, Bill Nye the Science Guy. After the show ended in 1998, Nye continued to serve as a science advocate through his public activities. His latest efforts have been aimed at combating scientific ""illiteracy,"" taking on climate-change skeptics and creationists. This year, he published ""Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation"" and recently explained evolution using emoji.Read more from Next Avenue: 5 ways to make positive change in 2015 What to know about health by 50, 60 and 70 What to know about caregiving by 50, 60 and 70"
