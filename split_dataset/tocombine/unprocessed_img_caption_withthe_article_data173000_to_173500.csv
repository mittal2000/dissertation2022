Campaign 2012 is rich with images that conjure the seriousness and silliness that unfold side-by-side in any presidential race. Who could have predicted that a superstorm would overshadow and scramble the presidential campaign in its final days? President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney revised and re-revised their campaign schedules as Hurricane Sandy, a most unlikely October surprise, barreled up the East Coast and then roared ashore in New Jersey. (AP Photo/NOAA)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb126193c000018010bba2d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I'm going to go out on a limb and say something very controversial: I don't think that anyone is ""stupid"" for wanting to know more about what role climate change may or may not have played in the formation and strength of Hurricane Sandy, no matter  what the editors at Business Week might think.Before I go deeper into my radical opinion, I first want to let everyone know that I'm a political liberal. That should have nothing to do with a discussion about weather and climate, but the reality of today is that political persuasion generally determines the stance on climate change. Liberals are supposed to believe that all extreme weather is proof of climate change, and the conservative position is one of denial.When it comes to the weather, though, I prefer science to politics.I understand that the earth's climate has been warming for more than a century, and I don't discount that man likely has had at least some role in the warming. I believe that we need to wean ourselves off fossil fuels and develop alternative and, preferably, sustainable energy alternatives, not only because of the potential impact of greenhouse gases but for reasons related to air pollution, water pollution, and the political benefits of not having to rely on a finite resource of energy that we don't -- and shouldn't -- have exclusive world rights to.Just because I believe those things, however, doesn't mean that I have to accept that a powerful and devastating hybrid storm is in and of itself proof of a changing climate.No single weather event is proof of climate change any more than one tranquil hurricane season is proof that global warming doesn't exist.Extreme weather, including powerful hurricane and hybrid storms, has always been part of the climate along the East Coast of the United States, including the mid-Atlantic region and Northeast.  (NOAA image showing hurricanes from 1950 through 2004)A 1938 Category-3 hurricane pounded Long Island and New England, killing over 700 people. Four Category-3 hurricanes hit New England between 1944 and 1960, and 11 hurricanes (ranging from Category 1 to Category 4) made direct landfall in the Carolinas between 1947 and 1959.These storms weren't attributed to climate change; they were merely part of the extremes of weather that are part of a normal climate. Is Sandy assumed to be climate change-related because of its hybrid nature?   (NOAA image of the ""Perfect Storm"")That's not a strong argument. Hybrid storms, although rare, are certainly not unheard of. The so-called Perfect Storm of 1991 (of movie and book fame) was a powerhouse hybrid storm in the Atlantic, and Hurricane Agnes of 1972 became a hybrid storm as it produced record flooding in much of the Northeast.Powerful and sometimes devastating storms affected this region long before climate change was even considered, so I need more proof than the circular argument of ""Global warming causes more extreme storms, and we had an extreme storm, so it's global warming.""I need to know what the difference is between those storms and Sandy in order to say that Sandy was directly affected by climate change and the others weren't. I'm not saying that would be an easy thing for climate scientists to determine and quantify, but I'm not stupid for wanting to know the science."

Limited public transit has returned to New York and most major bridges have reopened but will require three occupants in the vehicle to pass. With the death toll currently over 70 and millions of homes and businesses without power, the US east coast is attempting to recover from the effects of floods, fires and power outages brought on by superstorm Sandy. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb126171f00003901233164.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Waiting in a 45-minute line Friday morning at a Hess gas station in Center Moriches, Long Island, to fill up a portable fuel tank, Chip Daniel noticed sudden a flurry of police cars surrounding the station. He heard shouts and stomping, and the groaning of drivers in the packed crowd of cars in what is becoming an increasingly familiar scene at New York and New Jersey gas stations in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.""There was some jackass trying to cut the line and they called the cops. Four police cars came up to him and he began arguing with the police,"" said Daniels, 44. ""It took them some time, but finally he went back to his own spot.""In Moorestown, N.J., where Anna Sanders was staying with relatives after her home near Newark had lost power, she watched similar scenes unfold via social media, and even set up a Twitter account dedicated to helping other residents find fuel at the state's packed and often closed gas stations. ""Things sound pretty bad ... Please try to be nice to the attendants, it's obviously not their fault and they seem to be getting the brunt of lots of anger,"" she told The Huffington Post by phone, echoing her online advice.As the East Coast and severely damaged neighborhoods in New York and New Jersey continue to recover from Hurricane Sandy, the heroic rescues and caring neighborhood spirit of the storm's immediate aftermath has in some cases morphed into rudeness, heated arguments, ruthless competition and threats of violence, while struggling residents scour for everything from fuel and food to generators and space on packed public transit lines. Businesses have reported looting at stores on Coney Island, there have been unconfirmed reports of burglars posing as utility workers and, in at least one extreme case reported by the Associated Press, a man was arrested Thursday in Queens for pulling a gun on a customer while trying to cut ahead in line at a gas station.""This is one of the enduring questions. Does adversity bring out the best or worst in people?"" said Ben Orlove, an anthropologist at Columbia University who studies human reactions to natural disasters. Living on New York's Upper West Side, which largely escaped damage, Orlove said he has mostly witnessed New Yorkers going to lengths to help each other, from offering shelter to friends and family without power, to volunteering to make food deliveries to the elderly. ""But there are always those who become more selfish,"" he said.Across the region, the problem has been most apparent at crowded gas stations, where customers have had to deal with up to three-hour long lines for access region's limited fuel supply. The sporadic breakdown of decency has especially been on display in hard-hit New Jersey, with news and social media reports of a small number people turning from an ethos of sharing resources after the storm to a fend-for-yourself mentality.Virginia Arnold, a mother of four who lives near Philadelphia and away from much of the damage, posted on Twitter about a friend with no electricity who was caught in an unpleasant situation on Thursday.""I have a friend at work who lives in New Jersey. Loaned her neighbor her generator, now they won't give it back,"" she wrote.""Some [expletive] tried to fight me today because I wouldn't let her bum ass charge her cellphone on my work generator...did you buy my gas? no,"" wrote another woman on Twitter.Even in areas where there is ample gas or a sense of civility, it hasn't always lasted for long. When word spread via social media Thursday that a Shell station at 3rd Avenue and Bergen Street in Brooklyn still had some premium gas left, they immediately ran out. On Friday afternoon, a Shell attendant sat in the darkness behind a glass window and refused to speak with a reporter from The Huffington Post. He just pointed aggressively at a large hand-written sign in front of him, as he had done so many times that day.""Don't know when the gas is coming,"" the sign read.At gas stations that still have fuel, fistfights between agitated people waiting in line are frequently being reported via social media, and some customers have taken to YouTube to post videos of altercations. On Thursday, WNET-TV reported that a Hess station in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn reported disorderly conduct and called in police for crowd control. The station quoted a man saying that a ""marked up"" black market for gas was emerging and that he had considered taking his gas across the street and sell it to people who didn't feel like waiting in line.Orlove, whose research partly focuses on hurricane preparation and recovery, said crowded gas stations are particularly susceptible to emotional outbursts and tense scenes.""There's a psychology of waiting. If you have a line that snakes around, people like that. It's better than one long line because you have a series of small points you can focus on,” he said. “[But] it's the opposite at gas stations, they have just big straight lines. Plus, you have the uncertainty of possibly getting to the pump and there being no gas. The anxiety goes up.""While extreme actions may stand out, it's not the norm. From the brave work of the National Guard to collections by the Red Cross and shelters run by local houses of worship, the stories of good far outnumber the stories of bad behavior, and police in New York and New Jersey say there has not been an unusual uptick in crime. ""There are police checking on rest areas and gas stations, but they not being deployed to any specific incidents,"" said New Jersey State Police spokesman Adam Grossman. In New York City, police spokesman Joseph Cavitolo also emphasized that he did not see isolated incidents as a sign of broader increase in crime.Many residents of powerless neighborhoods have even managed to make a bit of light out of the mildly post-apocalyptic nature of the proceedings.Ashley Ward, a comedian living on Manhattan's Lower East Side, said she and her husband, comedian Nate Starkey, had begun calling their neighborhood the ""Shadowlands,"" and whenever they needed power they would head to the ""Free Zone,"" which is any neighborhood above 35th street or over the bridge into Brooklyn. The name “SoPo” has also emerged as a popular delineation for the area “South of Power.”Jennifer Mudge, an actress in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, said her neighbor had nailed a bag of produce outside her window because the air was cold enough to serve as a refrigerator, while New York blog Gothamist posted a photo of Brooklyn residents charging phones by fire-powered generators as a National Guard truck rolled behind them. ""The Way We Live Now,"" the post half-jokingly began.“Lower Manhattan feels like a bizarre video game where they CGI’d some imagined New York City without electricity and people,” Mudge said. “But still, we’re really lucky.” "

Myself, a resident of that cultural gem, I was considered partly responsible for my losses when the government-built levees broke and flooded 80 percent of New Orleans. Why do I live in a region vulnerable to hurricane storm surge? Why should I be America's burden?Forget the fact that with logic like that, everyone who lives in a region that sees events measured by some sort of scale -- be it Fujita, Richter or Saffir-Simpson -- should pack up and leave. Nonetheless, compassion for Katrina survivors was lacking, many of whom were blamed for not heeding Governor Kathleen Blanco's order to evacuate.But I predict that Sandy will change that. Even though parts of Lower Manhattan from Wall Street to 34th Street remain without power, and floodwater is sitting stagnant in miles of century-old subway tunnels, it's not likely that anyone will suggest that everyone in Lower Manhattan ought to permanently relocate. It's not likely that anyone will recommend that the survivors in Hoboken or Queens should not ever return home.   Fifty-five percent of the nation's population lives in counties protected by levees. For centuries, mankind has settled near water for irrigation, navigation and aesthetics. Most of the nation's largest cities lie at least in part on a floodplain. The time has come to admit that one-size-fits-all flood protection will not adequately protect the regions with the most people, property and infrastructure. Our leaders will hopefully unanimously agree after Sandy.Founded after the levee failures during Katrina, Levees.org has a mission of education on why New Orleans flooded, and now has chapters in five states including New York.

In the case of climate change, President Obama may want to start investing in horseshoes and four-leaf clovers. The widespread attention to Hurricane Sandy, just a week before the election, has finally injected this vital issue into the national dialogue. Even Businessweek is declaring: ""It's Global Warming, Stupid."" For those concerned with climate change, this is both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing that climate change is back on the agenda. As was widely noted, this was the first time in several decades that climate change was not even discussed at the debates. Despite continued scientific findings revealing the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change has been seen as a losing political issue. But this surge of interest may also prove to be a curse. The links between Hurricane Sandy and climate change are indirect at best (for more on this, see good summaries here and here). We expect climate change to make events like this more common, but there are grave dangers in attributing single events to long-term changes in planetary systems. Misrepresenting the realities of climate change, as some like Roger Pielke Jr. have argued, risks damaging the long-term prospects for collective action. Though it may seem callous to discuss anyone benefiting from a natural disaster that has killed dozens and caused billions of dollars of damage, Obama's political prospects will, no doubt, gain in the short-term from this renewed interest in climate change. Mayor Bloomberg's post-Sandy endorsement of Obama is one example. Sandy also draws attention to Mitt Romney's flippant remark about not caring about sea levels rising at the Republican Convention as well as his proposals to get rid of FEMA. Even if wide swaths of America did not, Obama seems to have caught a break. It's about time, his energy policy advisers are likely exclaiming. Unexpected events have not been good to Obama in the past. When he came into office, he sought to push a bipartisan energy deal that would trade support for offshore oil drilling and nuclear power in exchange for support for renewable energy system development. Though many environmentalists (including myself) bristled at his support for offshore oil and atomic energy, it was possible to see it as a necessary cost of doing business. In most eras, the art of politics has been the art of compromise. But global events forestalled any such deal being made. The first was the blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. This took away one of Obama's key bargaining chips. Less than a year later, the nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima took away another trade asset. In the immediate aftermath of such highly visible disasters, the President could no longer use either of his intended compromises to pursue a renewable energy deal. Luck was not on his side. Will Sandy balance the scorecard? It's far too early to tell, though there is little reason to think this will be the case. We have not seen structural changes resulting from previous disasters including Hurricane Katrina, the BP oil spill, or Fukushima. There is no immediate evidence to suggest that Sandy will lead to a long-term shift in our climate conversations. Yet any bounce for Obama due to perceived linkages between Sandy and climate change is likely a good thing for environmentalists, particularly given that it is coming so close to the election. There is little that would be more damaging to the prospects for climate action than a Romney administration backed by a Republican House. With four more years in office, Obama will have several additional opportunities to push for a comprehensive deal on energy and climate. There remains a danger that talking about climate change because of Sandy will backfire in the long-term.

I addressed the first thought in an article entitled, ""The Architecture of Anxiety and Intrusive Thoughts"". The second I'll address here.When an engaged client first shared the thought ""What if I'm gay?"" with me several years ago, I thought she was an anomaly. I worked with her the same way that I work with all intrusive thoughts -- understanding that it's a flare sent from the inner self designed to attract your attention and then unpacking the feelings and beliefs that the thought is covering up -- but it was only when I started hearing the same thought from other clients and courageous e-forum members that I understood how many people perseverate on this question.What separates this thought from the other common intrusive thoughts is that there is, in fact, an element of truth to it. If you've studied human sexuality or examined your own with an observing and non-judgmental eye, you know that sexual orientation exists on a spectrum with many people having bisexual or bicurious tendencies. In our ego's desire to delineate life into nice, neat, manageable packages, we like to say that people are either this or that: either black or white; either Democrat or Republican, either gay or straight. We don't like shades of gray. We're uncomfortable with ambiguity. So when it comes to sexuality, most people cringe to think that their own orientation cannot be folded inside a tightly locked box.But sexuality is just that: it's an orientation. Most people are oriented toward preferring one sex over the other. But many heterosexual people -- more than you would ever guess -- have experimented sexually with the same sex or fantasize about the same sex. And if there's shame about this, if you don't know that experimenting with or fantasizing about the same sex doesn't mean that you're secretly gay but is a normal part of healthy sexuality, the natural impulses are pushed underground where they mingle with shame and emerge, sometimes years later, as anxiety.The ""Am I gay?"" question points to two of the most challenging concepts for the anxious mind to accept, especially when you're on the verge of marriage: that love is a choice and that there are no guarantees or certainties regarding the outcome of this choice (this also applies to the converse situation of someone in a same-sex relationship perseverating on the thought, ""What if I'm straight?"").Our culture certainly doesn't help us accept the reality that love is a choice. As I've written about extensively, we live in a romance-addicted culture and we've all, from the time we're old enough to absorb information, been steeped in the fantasy that love is a feeling and when you meet The One, you'll know it and be swept off into the landscape of happily ever after. (Buzzwords in italics.) So it's often a long, hard road to recondition the mind toward the truth, and when the anxious thought of ""What if I'm gay?"" infiltrates into consciousness, it preys on an already faulty foundation and quickly develops into a mental earthquake of seismic proportions.This leads to the second challenging concept to accept: in order to make the choice to be with one partner, those prone to anxiety believe that they need 100 percent certainty that they're straight (or gay if the person is committing to a same-sex partnership). The anxious mind says, ""How can I commit to my partner if I'm questioning my sexuality? That's not fair to him (or her). What if, years down the road, I discover that I really am gay? Don't I need to figure this out now so that I avoid the possibility of divorce?"" And herein lies the underlying root that instigates the need for certainty: if you're certain about your sexual orientation, then you can divorce-proof your marriage before it begins. So the fear of being gay is connected to the need for certainty, which is connected to the fear of loss and failure.Treatment: Pulling the Thought Out By The RootThe traditional treatment of OCD-type thoughts follows two routes: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and/or medication. While the success rate is high with CBT, I have also found that, unless the root cause of the thought is addressed, one healed thought will often give way to a new intrusive thought. It's much like banging the gopher back into the hole only to find it popping out from another hole.I work a bit differently from the traditional treatment of OCD. I dig deeper into the roots of the intrusive thoughts and recognize them as a cover-up for deep wells of pain and false beliefs that need attention. They're like flares that your inner self are sending up as a way to get your attention, but they're not the truth. Working with the thoughts on the surface level may offer short-term relief but it doesn't address them at the core, which requires pulling them out by the roots. This is challenging, painful work. It requires reversing the false beliefs that say, ""I can't handle my pain. If I feel my pain, I'll never stop crying. If I feel my fear, I'll go crazy."" While these beliefs may have been true as a young child when you didn't have the support of a solid, loving parent to hold you as you cried, they're no longer true as an adult. Feeling your pain is a necessary part of healing yourself from the inside out.If you find yourself plagued with the thought, ""What if I'm gay?"" the first course of action is to develop a tolerance for the possibility that you may have gay or bisexual tendencies but that you're choosing to be with the opposite sex. The next step is to recognize that attaching on to the thought is your fear/pain/uncertainty trying to protect you from the risk of opening your heart to love. You likely have an old belief that plays silently in your subconscious that says, ""Love isn't safe,"" because perhaps what you knew of love as a child only felt like pain, betrayal, heartache, despair, and loneliness. The intrusive thoughts are designed to keep you safe, in a box, and protected from the risk of love. The work is about unearthing the old stories, bringing compassion to your scared self, allowing yourself to feel the old pain and sit with the current fear, developing a practice of letting go as an antidote to the wounded self that tirelessly tries to control, and finding the faith and courage to take the risk of opening your heart with your loving, present, available partner. Sound easy? It's the work of a lifetime.*** Sheryl Paul, M.A., has counseled thousands of people worldwide through her private practice, her bestselling books, her e-courses and her website.

8,DIVORCE,Are Baby Boomers Still Pushing Up the Divorce Rate?,"Robert Hughes, Jr., Contributor

In young adulthood, they pushed up the divorce rate to unprecedented numbers, which raised many questions about the impact of divorce on their children. Now that this generation is mostly over 50 years of age, it is interesting to look at what has been happening with regards to their divorce rate in middle age and consider new questions about the impact of divorce on their well-being and their relationships with their children. First, a look at the trends in the divorce rate among this group. Susan Brown and I-Fen Lin recently completed a paper they titled, The Gray Divorce Revolution, in which they report that the divorce rate of American couples over 50 has been rapidly rising over the past 20 years. Using data from the Census Bureau, Brown and Lin examine the divorce rate from 1990 to 2010 among couples who are 50 years of age and older. They found that the divorce rate has doubled over this 20 year period.  In 1990, the divorce rate for people 50 and older was about 4.9 divorces per 1,000 married persons and in 2010, the rate was 10 divorces per 1,000 married persons. During this same period of time, the overall divorce rate for the United States remained flat or slightly declined from about 19 divorces per 1,000 persons in 1990 to 18 in 2010. Note that the number of people over 50 years of age has increased during that time as well; 600,000 persons over age 50 got divorced in 2010 compared to about 200,000 in 1990. Brown and Lin also tell us more about these divorcing Americans. The divorce rate varies by racial/ethnic characteristics, income, employment, education, length of marriage and number of marriages. As we have seen in other marriage and divorce trends, African Americans experience the most fragile marriages. This finding remains true for those over 50 as well. For African Americans over 50, the divorce rate is twice that of White and Hispanic couples. Individuals with a college education had the lowest divorce rate compared to those with less than a college education. Employment status also yielded rate differences; retired persons had the lowest divorce rate, followed by employed persons. Unemployed persons over 50 had the highest rate of divorce. Interestingly, the divorce rate by income groups did not differ very much. Marital history, including the duration of the marriage, also factors into the likelihood of divorce. Among older Americans, the divorce rate for those who have been married for 40 years is about 3.2 divorces per 1,000 married persons. When you compare this group to those who have been married less than 10 years, the differences are dramatic; there were almost 29 divorces per 1,000 married persons. Many of the people in this group with marriages under 10 years remarried. In general, remarriages are at greater risk of divorce; for middle-age persons, the increased risk of divorce is 2.5 times that of the rate for first marriages. For persons over 65 years of age who are remarried, the divorce risk is four times the rate for first marriages.So what does this mean? We know relatively little about divorce in middle age, but what we do know is worrisome. On average, the physical and mental health of older people living alone is worse than for married individuals. This is especially true for men. There is also evidence that divorce in middle adulthood strains relations between parents and their children. Adult children are often pulled into their parent's disputes, much like younger children are caught in the middle of their parents' splits. Although many of these strains can be worked out over time, some relationships are never healed. Fathers are at the greatest risk of not having a close, continuing relationship with their children. From a human services and public policy perspective, there is much work that needs to be done to address the issues presented by a society with a growing number of older, single divorced persons who may have fragile ties to other family members."

It's a whole different education looking a foreigner in the eye and listening to what they really think. ""People think it's politicians who will change the world,"" says Diana Lapshina, cruise director of the Scenic Tsar, the first new passenger vessel on the Moscow-St. Petersburg waterways since the Soviet thaw. ""But this, this face-to-face interaction among the common people, this is how we come to understand each other. Through friendships, one-on-one."" Although international relations was probably not the top priority for this year's introduction of the new luxury Scenic Tsar, a sleek, amenity-laden vessel that sails back and forth between Moscow and St. Petersburg, it's certainly one of its most satisfying bonuses. For an idealist like me who believes in the power of travel to further truth, peace and open communication, my recent voyage on the refurbished river barge couldn't have been more meaningful. I had daily interaction with Russians from all age groups, from those who once stood in lines for chickens and toilet paper to young fashionistas who snatch up pricey Denis Simachev (Moscow's 38-year-old wild child designer) t-shirts as fast as he can get them into Moscow's opulent new shopping malls.Suffice it to say, the Russian story I grew up with is no more accurate than recent jargon about nefarious geopolitical threats from a foolhardy presidential candidate. ""We hear from Romney that we are returning to communism. And we think, 'Really?'"" says Arty Lavronenko, a Russian linguist who travels back and forth between the two countries. ""That's certainly news to us.""He went on to opine about not only politicians, but about mass media that he calls ""one of the biggest tragedies of the 21st century."" At least when it comes to spreading fear and misinformation. Let's take Pussy Riot, for example. Most Russians, although proud of their newly-acquired freedom of speech, think Pussy Riot deserved to be punished. ""Maybe not two years in work camps. That might have been a bit severe,"" says Vadim Palchun, a poetic Russian who sees both sides of Russia's transformation from hammer and sickle to Hermes and sable. ""But most Russians (86 percent according to Levada Center, Russia's equivalent of Gallup Polls) feel it was disrespectful to protest in a church."" Indeed, a mere six percent of Russians sympathize with the all-female group that has dominated the headlines since their February 21 performance in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior. Even Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, although flattered by the support, reiterated from prison camp that they don't want their music turned into ""a capitalist commodity."" But back to Russian indignation over choosing the church as a political platform. To Russians, who surprised me with their devotion to religion, surely a byproduct of being deprived of it for 74 years, there are some lines better not crossed. Still, they're fiercely protective of their freedom of expression. ""We can say whatever we want,"" Lavronenko emphasized, proving his point by making a joke about Putin and insisting his wife needs a new hair cut. ""See, there's no KGB coming after me.""No subject was off-limits with the Scenic Tsar's all-Russian staff who were consistently warm, friendly and eager to dispel ongoing rumors and stereotypes. In fact, we were far more reticent picking ""acceptable topics"" than the Russians were in answering our questions with unapologetic aplomb.Meeting such amusing, thoughtful and uninhibited Russians was by far the highlight of the 14-day cruise between the country's two most well-known cities. But here are five more reasons why Russia's new Scenic Tsar is, in my humble opinion, the best introduction to a misunderstood country: 1. Nothing about Russia is straight-forward. Winston Churchill's comment that Russia is ""a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma"" is still true today. Nothing here is simple, not getting a visa, not traversing the country (traffic is never-ending, resembling LA freeways at the best of times) and certainly not understanding the language. So by putting your travel fates in the hands of Scenic Tsar's expert staff, confusion and wasted time is all but eliminated. No-nonsense Lapshina went so far as to help us navigate ATM's and decipher dollar to rouble ratios. 2. Hotel rooms are outrageous. For nearly a decade, Moscow has led the list of cities with most expensive hotel rooms. According to a biannual study by Hogg Robinson Group (HRG), the Russian capital is numero uno when it comes to top price ($407 average nightly rate), mainly because the hotel demand is simply higher than the supply. On the Scenic Tsar, your bedroom is included (as well as amazing food, live nightly music and an on-board doctor) and there's no need to repack your bags when moving from city to city. Plus, this small boat (56 rooms) with balcony cabins, sophisticated lighting, plenty of closet space, free WiFi and other luxury accoutrements puts most hotel offerings to shame.3. There's more to Russia than Moscow and St. Petersburg. I wouldn't trade my four days in each of those cities for all the Faberge eggs in Russia. Well, maybe for all of them. Seeing the Kremlin, Red Square and, of course, the Hermitage in St. Petersburg has been on my bucket list for years. But to really experience a new place, beyond the pat description in a guidebook, it's important to leave the city behind, to get out into the country, meet people who don't cater to tourists. This Imperial Jewels of Russia tour winds through many rivers, Europe's two biggest lakes, in and out of locks and stops in several exotically historic small towns including the Golden Ring city of Yaroslavl, founded in 1010, and Khizi Island, whose 22 timbered onion domes is one of few Russian locations in the new film, Anna Karenina. Of Russia's 15 World Heritage sites, Scenic Tsar takes in four.4. Private ballet performances and other perks are thrown in. How many people can say they've seen a private ballet performance in an Imperial Russian Palace? In a small theater in the sumptuously barbaric Vladimir Palace, just down the Neva from the Winter Palace, we enjoyed a rare performance by dancers from two of St. Petersburg's great ballet companies. Our visit to the Moscow Space museum concluded with a Q and A with former cosmonaut Alexandre Laveykin. Scenic Cruises sets up lots of rare, one-of-a-kind experiences including vodka tasting, (who knew there were so many kinds of vodka), riding Moscow's impressive Metro and a special tour of Ivan the Terrible's 400-year-old St. Basil's Cathedral. And because the Scenic Tsar is all-inclusive, there is no charge for this impressive line-up of excursions.5. Even the boat itself has a romantic heritage. Although the ship is marketed as the Scenic Tsar by an Australian company (Scenic Cruises, a leader in upping the ante on Europe river cruising), it's owned by a Russian company and its bow still carries its original name, the Alexander Grin. Grin, although not as well-known as Tolstoy, Pushkin, Dostoevsky and other Russian scribes, was a poet and novelist who lived in St. Petersburg in the early 20th century. Scarlet Sails, probably his best known story, is a fantasy tale about explorers finding adventure, romance and ultimate truth. To my way of thinking, the name is absolutely perfect.Photos: E.

New Jersey's shoreline attractions were hit by several ferocious storms over the last century. Though these disasters have repeatedly demolished infrastructure, homes and even hotels, the past that serves as prelude is a history of resilience and recovery.On September 14, 1944 a hurricane given the number seven -- this was prior to the practice of naming storms -- slammed into the New Jersey shore. At 5:25pm, the lights went out and the Military Police guarding the boardwalk had to peer through the dark as 96-mile-an-hour winds whipped up 30-foot waves that battered the shore. An eyewitness recalled seeing an unusually high wave pick up the boardwalk and break it apart. German prisoners of war would eventually help pick up after the storm, which did some $100 million in damage. The city, which rumors had declared no more, was back on its feet a year later, hosting the Miss America pageant and generally getting along with life under the leadership of Nucky Johnson, the inspiration for a certain HBO anti-hero.The city was hit hard again on Ash Wednesday, 1962, when a storm that gained strength over the Carolinas ripped off part of the Steel Pier and loitered over the city. The storm, which had not been predicted by meteorologists, brought not only heavy waves but also snow and ice. The equipment for measuring weather was destroyed.Later that year, ground was broken on the Atlantic City Expressway, which gave Philadelphia and New York better access to the city's casinos and hotels and helped grow Atlantic City into the destination it was on Sunday, prior to the storm.Over the last six months, Atlantic City has seen the opening of a major resort, the Revel, and an announcement about the creation of a local Margaritaville. These projects not only bring jobs, but breed corporate investment in the welfare of the community. The recovery may also be speeded by the potential losses that ongoing casino closings represent, some $5 million a day in combined revenue.Both the opening of new casinos and the likely enhancement of the boardwalk during cleanup from Sandy are part of Atlantic City's slow metamorphosis from purveyor of Americana-tinged entertainments into world-class destination for discerning travelers. Sandy has been a horror for the Jersey coast, but it is important to understand its destruction in the context of a stormy history. If past is precedent, rumors of Atlantic City's death are greatly exaggerated."

According to officials, the fumes inside the home were three times the danger level.The toxic gas becomes fatal with sustained concentrations above 150 parts per million, however symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, including headache, nausea and dizziness, may present themselves at 70 ppm.In the aftermath of natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy, people affected are warned to be cautious while using gas-powered equipment that produce carbon monoxide, an odorless and colorless gas that can be deadly if inhaled.In Newark, N.J., two 19-year-olds, Mudiwa Benson and Kenya Barber, died from carbon monoxide poisoning because the generator was too close to the home, while police believe 55-year-old Rafael Reyes of New Brunswick, who was running a generator in his basement, and a 65-year-old Edison man with a generator in his garage also died as a result of the close proximity of the devices.In Pennsylvania, four people died in separate incidents as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from generator fumes.""The risk for carbon monoxide poisoning due to indoor use of propane stoves or generators is a major concern of public health officials after the storm,"" Dr. Robert Glatter, a physician at New York City's Lenox Hill Hospital, told CBSNews.com. ""The only safe use of such generators or stoves is outdoors, well away from any windows that could transmit fumes indoors.""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises using generators at least 20 feet away from homes, since there's not enough ventilation within garages and basements or near open windows to prevent fatal poisoning.
