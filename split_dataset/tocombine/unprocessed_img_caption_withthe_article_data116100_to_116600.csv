0,POLITICS,Why We Must Empower Victims of Human Trafficking,"Sen. Roger Wicker, ContributorU.S. Senator for the State of Mississippi",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-we-must-empower-victi_b_5572039.html,"Although news headlines often glibly refer to a ""war on women"" in political terms, policymakers might well devote more energy to sex trafficking -- a nightmarish war faced by the most vulnerable among us, young women who are being bought and sold for sex against their will.",2014-07-09,"NOTE: PICTURE POSED BY MODEL. A silhouette of a child is seen, as a disturbing report revealed that children are among hundreds of young women being trafficked into Ireland to be sold into the sex trade. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cf50210000d601c962bb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"No state in America is free from the stain of human trafficking -- a rampant form of slavery that seems unimaginable in this day and age. Trafficking is not a problem faced only by faraway countries. It exploits thousands of men, women, and children in the United States each year. These innocent Americans are robbed of their basic freedom to live as they choose.  Human trafficking is a persistent and evil crime. In fact, investigations and prosecutions at the federal and state levels are on the rise. The Polaris Project, which operates a national hotline for victims and those with information about trafficking, estimates there were more than 5,000 potential trafficking cases just last year.  Children and youth are particularly vulnerable to forced labor and trafficking for sex, often coerced through intimidation and violence by family members, pimps, or strangers. They are abducted in their own communities, taken from their loved ones, and sold.   The horror stories are endless. Consider the 12-year-old runaway who was kidnapped in New York City and advertised on a sex trafficking website. Or the 16 juveniles -- ranging in age from 13 to 17 years old -- rescued in a sex trafficking operation during this year's Super Bowl. These children face unique challenges as victims, in need of both justice and rehabilitation.   A bill I have introduced, the ""End Trafficking Act of 2014,"" would close current gaps in existing laws to stop trafficking and prosecute those who perpetrate it. I believe more can be done to address the complex issues associated with trafficking, including what drives it and how victims can receive the counseling they need.   Sex trafficking affects individuals of all backgrounds and races, but it disproportionately impacts women, both domestically and internationally. Although news headlines often glibly refer to a ""war on women"" in political terms, policymakers might well devote more energy to sex trafficking -- a nightmarish war faced by the most vulnerable among us, young women who are being bought and sold for sex against their will.   One proposal in my bill is a court-based pilot program modeled after Hawaii's ""girls courts"" and the federal drug court system. Often juvenile trafficking victims are charged with a delinquency offense in order to be detained and kept away from their traffickers. Many laws on prostitution do not differentiate between adult prostitutes and children who have been exploited for sex. These minors should be considered victims but are often treated as offenders and fail to receive counseling and support while in detention. Some later return to the trafficker, who often warns their victims to distrust the police. A specialized court docket and integrated judicial supervision would put the well-being of the victim first, providing an opportunity for victims to return home and undergo treatment. Detention alone does not amount to rescue.   My bill also seeks to punish the drivers of the problem -- both traffickers and the buyers, or ""johns,"" they serve. First, there should be strict enforcement of laws already on the books that prohibit the purchase of sex with minors. Second, child victims should have a longer statutory limitations period to file a civil suit against their trafficker. Finally, those who distribute or benefit financially from commercial advertising that promotes prostitution should face criminal charges. My bill would do all three.   As part of the criminal underworld, trafficking is hard to measure in scope and magnitude. The precise number of domestic victims is unknown. However, greater interagency cooperation and outreach can assist efforts to understand who is affected as well as determining the most effective ways to respond.   The United States remains the freest, most prosperous nation in the world. And yet, it is also a country where traffickers still find and transit victims, putting U.S. citizens and foreign nationals at risk. Fighting human trafficking within our borders will not completely eradicate the problem, which affects some 21 million people worldwide. We can, however, serve as a model for other countries to follow and better protect those here at home."

2,SCIENCE,Why Are There No Drugs For Ebola Virus?,"Kartik Chandran, Ph.D. and John M. Dye, Ph.D., Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ebola-virus-drugs_b_5572084.html,The first outbreak of Ebola was in 1976 -- nearly 40 years ago -- so why is there yet no cure?,2014-07-09,"A picture taken on June 28, 2014 shows members of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) putting on protective gear at the isolation ward of the Donka Hospital in Conakry, where people infected with the Ebola virus are being treated. The World Health Organization has warned that Ebola could spread beyond hard-hit Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to neighbouring nations, but insisted that travel bans were not the answer. To date, there have been 635 cases of haemorrhagic fever in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, most confirmed as Ebola. A total of 399 people have died, 280 of them in Guinea. AFP PHOTO / CELLOU BINANI (Photo credit should read CELLOU BINANI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d57d9b260000132951ef07.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The deadly outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa is the worst on record, with over 500 deaths reported to date. Now that it has spread to three neighboring countries, the crisis appears to be far from over. The geographical complexity of the current crisis highlights one of the most crucial obstacles to successfully containing it -- the reluctance of those infected to come forward. Because Ebola spreads through direct physical contact between infected and uninfected individuals, successful containment relies on the isolation of Ebola patients, and preventive quarantine of anyone with whom they may have come into contact. Unfortunately, in the current outbreak, many people with possible symptoms have chosen instead to shelter with their families or local communities, where they risk setting off new cycles of virus transmission.Why are people unwilling to come forward? One of us (John Dye) interviewed over 100 survivors of previous Ebola outbreaks in Uganda and asked them exactly this question. Some thought they may just have malaria or dengue, which are hard to differentiate from Ebola in the early stages, and they were afraid of contracting Ebola from other infected patients when quarantined in the hospital. Others worried about the stigma that could attach to them and their families, that they might lose their jobs, or return from the hospital to find their home burnt down and belongings destroyed. Many feared they were going to the hospital to die, and to die alone, away from their families. Hanging over all of these conversations was the unspoken understanding that there was no treatment for Ebola available to them. Sadly, the situation today remains the same. While careful supportive care does indeed improve a patient's chance of survival, case fatality rates for Ebola virus disease remain extremely high, at 50-90 percent. We believe that the availability of an effective drug for Ebola would save lives, not least because it would encourage infected individuals and their families to seek treatment, thus curtailing the spread of the virus. The first outbreak of Ebola was in 1976 -- nearly 40 years ago -- so why is there yet no cure?Paradoxically, the last decade has seen tremendous advances in Ebola virus research. We have learned much about its behavior in nature, how the virus exploits its hosts and subverts their immune systems to multiply, and how it causes disease as a result. In the U.S., with funding from both the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Defense (DoD), scientists are applying these basic discoveries to come up with new approaches to prevent and treat Ebola virus infections. For example, we are part of an NIH-funded research consortium whose goal is to develop a 'cocktail' of antibodies-virus-fighting immune proteins-that could be infused into patients to block Ebola virus infection. We and others are also receiving support from the DoD to discover drugs that shut down the ability of Ebola to infect human cells.To understand why our Ebola drug cupboard is still empty despite recent progress, it is important to consider how pharmaceutical drugs are typically developed. Research scientists, often in academic institutions or small biotech companies, make a discovery that suggests a possible clinical application. After laying the groundwork, they pass the baton to a company with the expertise and deep pockets necessary to carry a potential drug through the protracted, complex, and expensive process of optimization, animal testing, manufacture, and clinical trials that will (with lots of luck) culminate in regulatory approval of the drug for human use. This is where the process stalls for 'orphan' diseases like Ebola. Pharmaceutical companies are understandably unwilling to invest the considerable resources needed to develop drugs against a disease that currently infects only a few thousand people every few years in resource-poor countries, especially when there is little chance they will recoup their investment, let alone turn a profit.Our experience with HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C teaches us that once we have acquired the basic scientific knowledge, it is possible to develop antiviral drugs that save lives. Diseases like Ebola should be no exception. In this case, the hurdles we face are not scientific, but rather economic and political. To bridge the gap in the drug development process, we will need new, creative models that engage governments, academia, pharmaceutical companies, private philanthropic organizations, and even individual citizens. The essence of emerging viral threats like Ebola is their transnational and unpredictable nature, and we need to be ready.Kartik Chandran, Ph.D., is an associate professor of microbiology & immunology and the Muriel Block Faculty Scholar in Virology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

And the connection to further drug use, the connection to depression, connection to lack of motivation -- there’s nothing positive that comes out of it.”He also warned of dire health consequences, suggesting marijuana may be more likely than tobacco to cause cancer.""When you smoke a marijuana joint, it’s like smoking 18 cigarettes,” he said. “That’s the amount of carcinogens that you intake.”He is likely citing a six-year-old study from New Zealand published in the European Respiratory Journal that found smoking one joint is equivalent to the effect that smoking 20 cigarettes has on the lungs. However, later studies, including one from 2012 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, did not detect any damage to pulmonary function -- or the lungs’ ability to take in and release air -- or instances of lung cancer caused by marijuana use. Mediaite also noted that casual marijuana smokers do not smoke nearly as many joints as tobacco users smoke cigarettes."

On Wednesday, Nunn sent a letter to Rep.

Kingston and Perdue will face each other in a July 22 runoff for the Republican nomination in the hope of succeeding retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.). ""I believe we have an opportunity to send a message to Washington,"" Nunn said in her letter. ""If we can join together and pledge to limit outside spending and third party ads, we can together show that the people of our state are tired of politics as usual. That message isn’t exclusively a Democratic message or a Republican message, it’s just common sense.""Georgia's Senate race has already seen almost $6 million in outside spending, according to OpenSecrets.org. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Wednesday that Nunn's campaign said it would follow the pledge only if both Kingston and Perdue agree to do so as well. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) were the first to come to such an agreement. In 2012, they signed a ""People's Pledge"" to limit political attack ads in their high-spending, high-profile Senate race. Despite the pledge's success last cycle, Brown rejected a request from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) to make a similar deal as he campaigns in this year's Granite State Senate race. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democrat challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and Dan Sullivan, one of the Republicans hoping to unseat Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), have also proposed pledges, though both have been rebuffed. HuffPost Pollster, which combines all publicly available polling data, shows the race is close between Nunn and Perdue as well as Nunn and Kingston. "

This week, his campaign sent out an email asking for contributions. The message stated, “We must crush Common Core,” the Houston Chronicle reports.Texas has never adopted the Standards. “Help Greg Abbott ensure that President Obama’s Common Core stays OUT of the Lone Star State by making a contribution today,” said the email from campaign staffer Lynn Haueter, according to the outlet. “We can’t let the Obama Administration get its hands on Texas schools.”According to Legal Newsline, the email also said: “Greg Abbott has a record of fighting to keep Common Core away from our state – because as parents, we know what’s best for our children … His plan returns genuine local control to our education system and will make Texas first in the nation in education.""While the federal government incentivized states to adopt the Common Core, the standards were nonetheless adopted voluntarily. They have increasingly come under fire from conservative politicians who see them as an example of federal overreach. In recent weeks, several states that originally adopted the benchmarks have reversed course.Abbott, who's the current state attorney general, confirmed that Texas cannot adopt Common Core in a ruling last month. The Texas Legislature previously passed a law outlawing the state from adopting the Common Core State Standards. When Abbott was asked by a state lawmaker about clarification on the law, Abbott wrote that although “Texas school districts are required to provide instruction in the essential knowledge and skills at appropriate grade levels … they may not use the Common Core State Standards Initiative to comply with this requirement,” according to the Houston Chronicle. Texas first refused to adopt the Common Core State Standards in 2009. At the time, former Education Commissioner Robert Scott expressed disapproval for the standards.“This effort can be seen as a step toward a federal takeover of the nation’s public schools,” Scott wrote in a letter to the state’s congressional delegation, according to the Texas Tribune. “I believe that the true intention of this effort is to establish one set of national education standard and national tests across the country.”"

By law, non-Mexican minors caught crossing illegally are put in the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, rather than being repatriated immediately. Writing for USA Today, DeWayne Wickham argued Monday that housing the children at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba would be an ideal solution for the current immigration crisis, even though, as he acknowledged, Haitian refugees sent there in the 1990s were ""treated only slightly better than the prisoners from the U.S. global war on terrorism.""Detainees on the U.S. Navy base at Guantánamo have been subjected to torture, according to Human Rights Watch and the bipartisan Constitution Project. But for the children of today's migration crisis, Wickham writes, the Navy base ""is capable of being a far more hospitable place,"" noting that it ""boasts movie theaters, American fast-food restaurants and excellent recreational facilities.""Wickham writes that the Central American child migrants are ""neither refugees of a war the U.S. was involved in, nor the product of a lingering ideological tug of war.""In fact, the United States has helped fuel violent conflicts in Central America since the 1950s, chiefly under the pretext of containing communism. The latest uptick in violence is at least partly a consequence of the U.S.-led war on drugs.Wickham, for his part, argues that the Central American countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have devolved into cauldrons of violence due to a lack of ""international pressure"" and not enough ""good sense."" Given the situation, Wickham says it's best to ""house all the children, temporarily, at Guantanamo Bay.""The U.S. government does not have a good track record of housing people at Guantánamo temporarily. Of the nearly 800 people who have been imprisoned there at some point since 2002, many spent years at the facility. Only eight were convicted by U.S. military commissions as of last year, according to the Center for Constitutional Rights. Of the 149 remaining prisoners, about half of them have been cleared for release, including a group of 58 Yemenis whom the Obama administration has refused to free, citing concerns about their country's stability.

The War on Poverty is the unofficial name for legislation first introduced by President Johnson during his State of the Union address on January 8, 1964, which led the United States Congress to pass the Economic Opportunity Act, which established the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to administer the local application of federal funds targeted against poverty.

The group contends that the Obama administration is exaggerating the economic impact of the trust fund depletion.""This spend now, pay later bailout is not serious. The Republican-controlled House should not succumb to the Obama administration's reckless rhetoric,"" said Heritage Action spokesman Dan Holler.The Camp proposal would employ a tactic known as ""pension smoothing,"" which allows companies to delay contributions to employee pension plans and effectively raises corporate profits and taxable incomes, thus producing more revenue for the U.S. Treasury.This was used to help pay for the last highway spending measure due to expire Sept. 30 and was considered by Democrats for a plan to extend long-term unemployment benefits, which has never come to a vote this year.Camp said in a statement that his proposals can win support from both Democrats and Republicans and buys more time for a longer-term highway funding solution.""This is the only package with a proven history of getting big bipartisan votes in both the House and Senate,"" Camp said, adding that a longer extension would have required much more difficult choices.Lawmakers from both parties have shown virtually no desire to raise the fuel taxes that feed the Highway Trust Fund. They have not been increased since 1993 and are proving inadequate to fund transportation projects due to improved vehicle fuel economy, fewer miles traveled and construction cost inflation.

(AP Photo/Lauren Victoria Burke, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cf132500008b013a5219.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Amid a vigorous congressional fight over funding for the U.S. Export-Import Bank, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) plans to raise another heated issue: money for coal-fired power plants. The current funding for the Export-Import Bank expires on Sept. 30. Ex-Im provides loans for projects in other countries that will purchase U.S.-manufactured goods or use U.S. services. Some House Republicans -- as well as a few Democrats -- have been resistant to reauthorizing the funding, arguing that it constitutes ""corporate welfare"" (see this HuffPost story by Zach Carter for more background on the fight).Talks between the House and Senate on Ex-Im reauthorization are still in the early stages. But Manchin plans to introduce an amendment to the reauthorization bill to boost coal. The amendment would block Ex-Im from enforcing a policy announced in December that would stop the bank from funding most coal-fired power plants abroad.The new policy bars money for ""high carbon intensity plants,"" except in situations where there are no other financially feasible options or when a proposed plant will come with carbon capture technology. The change puts Ex-Im in line with the U.S. Treasury Department, which made a similar policy change last October.Manchin's amendment, the text of which his office provided to The Huffington Post, would effectively block Ex-Im's new rule. It would bar enforcement of the rule if the rule ""would prohibit, or have the effect of prohibiting, any coal-fired or other power-generation project"" where that project would ""provide affordable electricity"" in low-income countries or would ""increase exports of goods and services from the United States or prevent the loss of jobs in the United States."" Environmental advocates, who had welcomed the policy change after years of complaining about major coal projects that the bank was funding, criticized Manchin's move. ""Ex-Im Bank's past coal projects are environmental, health and human rights debacles,"" said Doug Norlen, senior manager of the economic policy program at Friends of the Earth. ""With Ex-Im Bank's recent coal restrictions, we turned the corner towards a better future, but Sen. Manchin's bill would be a U-turn to the past.""Manchin spokesman Jonathan Kott said the senator is looking to introduce the amendment ""soon."""
