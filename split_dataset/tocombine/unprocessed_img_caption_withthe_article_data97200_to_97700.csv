TIME has hailed the Eddie Huang creation with ""the makings of an American original."" And that's exactly what we are -- American originals.",2015-02-10,FRESH OFF THE BOAT - Pilot (Gilles Mingasson/ABC via Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae55751f0000250122e6a7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I was young, friends would always excitedly tell me that I look just like Lucy Liu. Though absolutely complimentary, these occurrences were mildly confusing as I eventually came to realize that I share nearly no physical similarities with the Charlie's Angels star, besides the fact that we are both thin Asian females with freckles. Her squared jaw and almond shaped eyes are distinctly different than my own less angular, heart shaped, wide-eyed face. Despite that, one other similarity I share with Lucy is that we both come from Chinese families. It has never occurred to me that using chopsticks isn't like second nature to some people. I've had many a friend genuinely ask if I really eat orange chicken for dinner all the time. (The answer is no. Never.) Besides when checking a box on standardized testing forms, being Asian has rarely ever been a conscious label I carry with me as an American citizen. Sure, around the dinner table with my family or during summer visits to China, I've come to realizations of how incredible it is to share my food, language, and history -- our culture -- with my grandparents and cousins. But I have never felt outstandingly foreign to my fellow peers.That is, until recently. In a span of just a few months, Asian people have suddenly been thrust into the Hollywood spotlight. Like a juicing fad, Oriental racial diversity is now the new hot topic that the entertainment industry has decided to contend with. Seth Rogen and James Franco brashly tackled the North Korean enigma of Kim Jong-Un by attempting to poke fun at the ludicrousness of the situation in The Interview. John Cho was casted as the first ever Asian American romantic lead in U.S. television history for his role on Selfie, which was unfortunately cancelled before its initial 13 episodes even finished airing. Tyra Banks almost moved a girl of Asian descent to the Top 4 of the 21st cycle of America's Next Top Model, marking the farthest a female Asian contestant has achieved since its 2nd season. Now, ABC is ready to jump into the pool with its newest family-friendly primetime comedy, Fresh Off the Boat. The series, loosely based off of Eddie Huang's autobiographical memoir of the same title, follows a transplanted Taiwanese family of five during their first months of adjustment in the ""Wild Wild West,"" more commonly known as Orlando, Florida. Fresh's protagonist is young Eddie, the ""black sheep"" of the family who finds solace in hip-hop legends, trying his best to balance his strong Asian background while attempting to find his own identity in the predominantly white school cafeteria.In all honesty, I was dubious. The title itself was enough to spark hesitancy: ""fresh off the boat"" has been historically used as a derogatory phrase to describe immigrants from foreign, usually Eastern Oriental countries. Though I've been lucky enough to avoid ever being called a 'chink,' I've dealt with what I like to refer to as ""racial confusion"" all my life. Jokes about getting all A's, commentary about my eye size, and shock that I'm not a bad driver -- it's just a dose of the daily for any Asian American with friends of different ethnicities and backgrounds. To me, these stereotypes have been harmless, but it isn't always the case. At my own relatively liberal hometown high school, a Vietnamese American student once was stabbed to death while coming to the defense of his fellow Vietnamese friend who was bullied by a Caucasian student. In 2011, a study discovered that teen Asian students were the most bullied in U.S. schools over any other ethnic group, with 54 percent reporting having experienced bullying in the classroom and 62 percent that had dealt with cyberbullying online. In effort to keep Fresh within the family-friendly zone, the series only merely touches upon these unsung facts, hinting at discrepancies when Eddie finds himself shunned from a group of white friends upon pulling out strange, pungent Asian noodles for lunch during the series pilot. But more importantly, the ABC network show is giving the American population a brief, but authentic window into the life of an Asian American family -- giving them a chance to further understand this group of people beyond the stereotypes.The series has already received glowing praise for its revolutionary new perspective: The Los Angeles Times calls it a ""satire that works"" and Slate.com claims that the show is ""the latest reason to be grateful.""As many other fellow ABCs (American Born Chinese) have confirmed via Twitter which exploded with positive, approving Tweets during the two-episode premiere of Fresh on Wednesday, we are grateful. The appreciation is in the details -- from the all too familiar red and gold plastic Chinese bowls that the Huang's pass around the dinner table to the CLC (Chinese Learning Center), it's the first time I've felt a striking sense of familiarity on my television screen. It may come as a surprise to some that my family has never gathered to eat pancakes for breakfast while my father sits at the head of the table, flapping through a newspaper with his briefcase on hand -- my mother has always reserved the pristine dining room table strictly for formal occasions, a tradition many other Asian families also emulate. Instead, breakfast involved my father sitting with me at our circular, less formal kitchen table, laughing while I tried to grip a baozi (a steamed bun with meat or vegetables inside) with my child-size chopsticks. My mother and I converse in what many have dubbed ""Chinglish,"" or sentences with both Chinese and English mashed together. We take our shoes off when we enter a home, we exchange hongbao (red envelopes filled with cash) during special holidays and yes -- I've eaten chicken feet. And it's pretty good. TIME has hailed the Eddie Huang creation with ""the makings of an American original."" And that's exactly what we are -- American originals. It's been 20 years since the end of Margret Cho's All-American Girl, the last all-Asian comedy series that graced the U.S. television network. Fresh Off the Boat, with its refreshing open-door policy to Chinese culture and just the right dosage of family -- friendly humor, may have just what it takes to break that spell of silence -- hopefully for good.Deep down, I have always hoped that future young Asian Americans of all appearances -- Koreans, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese -- will have more than just Lucy Liu or Bruce Lee to consider as their celebrity Doppelgänger because more than likely, like me, they are unique and come in all different shapes and sizes. Just like everyone else. To the many strangers who have asked me, ""So, where are you from? No like, what are you?,"" perhaps someday ""American"" will be a sufficient answer. The conversation has been sparked, and I rest a little easier knowing that it begins today with the Huangs and their journey on Fresh Off the Boat. What ABC has begun to uncover can open the door to a world of rich, diverse culture, with so much to offer and share to curious friends, neighbors, and strangers who have never had the opportunity to join us at our dinner table. When they're ready, my mom will roll out the formal dinner plates, unleash endless plates of colorful Chinese dishes, and without a doubt, won't let them leave hungry. Starting today, Eddie is making it okay to bring noodles to the table. Perhaps he, or his late mentor Notorious B.I.G. said it best: ""If you don't know, now you know.""New episodes of Fresh Off the Boat air on ABC Tuesday 8/7C. "

The people they're pitching to have an insatiable appetite for the latest and greatest -- and they can't resist the allure of a well-buffed bright, shiny object. For advertisers, the use of ""new"" (and let's not forget ""new and improved"") is the glitter that turns products into gold. It's a timeless trope that has served marketers well for years. But, as the Baby Boomers continue to age, ""new"" is taking on on a new look.We live in the Age of Aging. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in fewer than than five years, fully half of the U.S. adult population will be 49 and older, and they will control 70 percent of disposable income. If these aging consumers are the ""mass"" in mass marketing, and if ""new"" truly is one of the most potent concepts in business, then figuring out how to serve up new products and ideas to these folks is going to be key to success.One aspect of ""new"" is obvious: making new things. New things are especially enticing to Baby Boomers because things that are new make them feel young. Look no further than technology: a massive growth sector that has become a virtual fountain of youth for Boomers who are clamoring to own and use the latest innovations and gadgets that help them feel vital and connected in a modern world.Another aspect of ""new"" is far less obvious, but equally as potent: making old things new again. Unless you've been looking for it, you probably haven't noticed all of the innovative energy that's being brought to old concepts -- i.e. the restoration and reintroduction of iconic brands from the Boomers' younger years. Who could forget Detroit's muscle cars of the '70s? They were wildly popular at the time, mass-produced to fuel the young Boomers' new mobility and iconoclastic spirit. As Boomers aged, their priorities shifted, and soon the ""family man"" was driving a more practical car. The muscle cars were gone, but not the memories. Today, Detroit has brought them back and they're more muscular than ever. Re-designed classics like Camaros and Challengers are enjoying a revival. We shouldn't be surprised that men in their 50s (the ones with memories and money) are turning back the hands of time with their hands firmly on the wheel of a timeless car from their youth.And, have you noticed that the home delivery of milk in glass bottles is back? How about listening to music on records again (didn't see that one coming did you?). Or the ubiquitous food truck -- does anyone remember the original food truck? It was Good Humor. One after another, Boomer brands and business concepts are boomeranging their way right back into our lives.The takeaway from all this is that everything old can, in fact, be new again -- now more than ever. The Boomers are the being considered the most valuable generation in the history of marketing, and as they age, smart brands will find a way to deliver now-stalgia : positive memories of the past made newly relevant in the here and now. This is the new way to market ""new"" -- re-positioning timeless classics in a new and timely way to take Boomers on that sentimental journey that reminds them of their youth, while also making them feel young again.Act now while supplies last!"

April 2009, in Bremen vor einem Vortrag an der Jacobs University in Bremen. Djerassi entwickelte zusammen mit John Rock und Gregory Pincus die Antibabypille.(AP Photo/Joerg Sarbach) ---Carl Djerassi, chemist and novelist, poses at the Jacobs University in Bremen on Tuesday, April 28, 2009. Djerassi is known his contribution to the development of the first oral contraceptive pill.(AP Photo/Joerg Sarbach)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c4f52100002501c870c5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week brought news that a great man had died, Dr. Carl Djerassi. He was someone I briefly worked with more than 25 years ago, a man who made a deep and lasting impression on me in many ways. And though you probably don't realize it, he is someone who touches your life daily, thanks to his serial chemical genius. First and foremost, Dr. Djerassi was renowned as one of the ""fathers of the human birth control pill,"" a catalyst for all the convenience, conflict and cultural change it begat. But, he didn't stop there. Djerassi also patented antihistamine, cortisone and other pharmaceutical wonders that continue to ease human sufferings, large and small, every day. So, the next time you have a stuffy nose or summer allergy attack, anaphylaxis, a sprained ankle or an ill-advised one night stand during your fertile days, just remember that Dr. Carl and his creations are there, working hard and unseen, to set things right.But one of the things missing from the lengthy obituary in the New York Times was his role as the creator of another kind of birth control, one for that most universally despised of urban pests -- the cockroach. It was during this colorful chapter in his life, one glossed over in media obits, but discussed with great humor in Dr. Djerassi's excellent autobiography, The Pill, Pygmy Chimps and Degas' Horse, that I had the horizon-expanding fortune to cross his path.Being both a brilliant scientist and businessman, Dr. Djerassi realized that the principals employed in the human birth control pill had another, perhaps even more lucrative, application -- in the world of agriculture. He followed up his venture with the human pill by founding another company that made countless millions more marketing sprays that would (essentially) sterilize flying farm pests, so they couldn't reproduce new generations of crop-eaters. Lady Pill Sequel? Birth Control for Cockroaches Fifteen years later, the fine folks at Black Flag were looking for a sequel to their mega blockbuster, The Roach Motel, and beat a path to Dr. Djerassi's door. At that time, the extraordinarily wealthy, European-born doctor was indulging his artistic passions -- writing plays, novels and poetry, and overseeing a vibrant artists' colony and residency program he established near San Francisco. Ultimately, a deal was struck, and they licensed his science for a new consumer product, Black Flag Roach Ender, which came with the snazzy registered tagline: ""Birth control for roaches."" The rub for Dr. Djerassi? He couldn't just sit back and count his residuals; they wanted him to be the face of the product, the ""star"" of a high-profile national publicity blitz. Thus, this old world scientist, with a penchant for high culture and the good life, was swept away from the bucolic Bay Area, and thrust into the media hotpot, to hawk ""a better bug spray"" in places far and wide. The first stop was a packed press conference at one of the Ivy League university clubs in New York, attended by serious science reporters and that less than gravitas-bearing breed I loved best, called ""feature reporters."" Then, it was off on a coast-to-coast tour to introduce this modern wonder to the citizens and media alike, seemingly only in the high-humidity, southern U.S. cities where the roaches grew as big as house cats.Onto the Electric Medicine ShowIn these days, before the satellite media tour was common practice (where you can now sit in a studio in New York or L.A. and do interviews with TV stations anywhere around the world), Dr. Djerassi would have to take his eminence to them bodily, via a multitude of long plane and car rides. For some reason, it was I who the powers that be at the agency designated to be his Sancho Panza, on this journey to the most highly-infested cockroach capitals of America.As a man of both vastly superior scientific and cultural intellect, it was apparent that Dr. Djerassi wouldn't suffer fools or time-wasters -- me or anyone else. Downtime was a mortal sin to a fine mind like his. In the minutes it took to deal with a clueless airline desk attendant, driver or waiter, he could perhaps envision another scientific breakthrough or, at the very least, dash off a poem to nourish his creative spirit, which cohabited in the same brain with his scientific genius.When you travel city to city with someone, for days and weeks, on cramped planes and in cars, when you give them their morning wake-up call and coffee, eat every meal with them, you have to establish either: A) Some kind of professional rapport to get the job done or, better yet; B) A personal one to make the experience a bit of a vacation from the daily grind for both parties.At first, I was pretty terrified of Dr. Djerassi. With his Bond-villain voice, his neatly trimmed gray hair and beard, his piercing glance, the genius I.Q. and some neck covering -- I assumed was an ascot -- he was anything but approachable. Picture Dos Equis' ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" for real -- that rugged, knowing look hooked up to both Einstein's and Picasso's brains. At first glance, he was more mad scientist from an old Hammer horror film than TV's kindly Marcus Welby, M.D. He was not the kind of guy you could talk spectator sports with, which was good because I had (and still have) no knowledge of the subject, the lubricant of so many business downtimes between males. Pill Doc Becomes Buddha to the Undercover BeatnikTo begin with, there wasn't much talking. He would sit reading his scientific journals, or scribbling poems, and I would be in the seat right next to him on the plane, thumbing through SkyMall or the local daily rag. In these days, the mid-80s, I was doing my best to impersonate a good corporate cog -- wearing a blue suit, a bow tie (clip-on too!), sporting the most modest of ""business mullets."" I knew it wasn't working and I think this bon vivant detected it from the jump, too; that there was an inner beatnik screaming to be set free in seat 22B.What sparked the connection between the 20-something flack and the 60-something genius inventor? It was jazz. Dr. Djerassi broke his concentration when he saw me pawing through my carry-on for some cassettes to feed my battered Walkman, for Sonny Rollins' Saxophone Colossus. With a sidelong glance and softly raised brow, he also took notice of my choice of reading material. It was a remnant of my post-college backpacker days, a well-thumbed copy of Henry Miller's Sexus, the super saucy book, and one of that lovely cathedral of excess, the trilogy The Rosy Crucifixion.All of a sudden, he was speaking with me. He was curious about me and my life, putting me under the figurative microscope. When he heard I was a musician, I could almost see written on his forehead: ""Excellent, so I guess this docent they sent to mind me isn't a complete fool after all!"" Next came questions about my life, what I wanted to do with it, why I was doing what I was doing now, what I was going to do way down the line when I was through with this life. The main interests he waxed on were his favorite writers and painters, his own writing and his desire to get this damn trek over so he could go back to North Cali and hang with the painters, poets and dramatists he was hosting at his artists' colony. ""Business was business, do well at it, take care of it, bank the proceeds and then devote yourself to your artistic passions."" That was pretty much the fortune cookie to the future, the life advice given to his undercover beatnik minder on United Airlines Flight 221 to Orlando.The Genius Grills Back the PressIt was always pleasurable to see him be interviewed by the press. He generally went easier on the print reporters, as there was more time to explain concepts and find a common ground, one that wasn't the lowest one, if he could steer things in that direction.The worst was when he appeared on those formulaically sunny, local TV morning shows. Time was precious, and the cosmetically sandblasted hosts always went straight to the sensational, the cheap laugh and the most guffaw questions on their index cards. While none of these appearances ended in tears for the hosts, occasionally Dr. Djerassi seemed to do a Dr. J -- to stop these interviews and suspend them in mid-air, with a curious glance and a few second of silence after a host asked a particularly idiotic question. Inevitably, he would ask me after interviews of this kind: ""Why do these people insist on asking the same ridiculous questions?"" I still don't have an answer to that.Another thing I remember about Dr. Djerassi was that he could turn on the charm like nobody's business when he wanted to, especially with stewardesses on a long flight or a restaurant maître d. Not in the least bit ""horn-dog"" mind you, just a suave European gentleman, the real ""Most Interesting Man in the World,"" who could enjoy his interactions with people, especially those of the fairer sex, especially if they were carrying an almost-full bottle of wine. He was trim and compact, about 5' 5"", with a cane to bear with a limp from a knee fusion done because of a skiing accident in the 1950s. But, man, he certainly knew how to charm the ladies -- just to bring a little Continental joy to the situation at hand. It also demonstrated to me that intellect and quiet charm could go a long way.The Sad End for Roach Ender, the Flack's Course StraightenedUltimately, the fate of Black Flag Roach Ender was not a kind one. The problem with the product was it wasn't fast-acting or instantaneously fatal enough for the American consumer. When you used the spray, the bugs didn't die right away. They lived out their lives for a few weeks, then gave birth to either nothing or some horrible mutation! Americans still don't have that kind of patience when it comes to homicide. The research said consumers wanted to spray and see the bugs die, as horribly as possible, right on the spot. In the end, the elegance of Dr. Djerassi's approach was complemented with some reliable old school toxic for a more-fast acting insect murder. If you're lucky in life, once in a blue moon, you have a brush with genius like this, someone astoundingly accomplished in their chosen endeavor, who can also give you a takeaway container of wisdom on all, and sundry that can last a lifetime. In my case, the week I spent traversing the hot and humid roach capitals of America with Dr. Djerassi was one of them."

NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this Photograph, user is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. (Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7786b2400005000988c0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich has just joined yet another elite list: the ninth coach in NBA history to record 1,000 regular-season wins. He sits at 1,000 wins and 462 losses for a 68.4 percent winning percentage, better than any of the other eight except Phil Jackson's 70.4 percent.In typical Popovich fashion, he refused to take credit. He told reporters after the game, ""I've been here a long time and I've had good players. That's the formula."" But dig a little deeper: Popovich is not only the NBA's longest-tenured active coach, helming the Spurs since 1996, but he's also one of only two coaches to reach 1,000 wins with one team (the other being Jerry Sloan with the Utah Jazz). The Spurs, in the Popovich era, have notched a heady 67.7 percent winning percentage, far and away the best in the NBA over that span.He's a three-time Coach of the Year winner who's led the Spurs to 17 consecutive playoff appearances, 16 seasons of 50 wins or better (in a season with 82 games), four seasons of 60 wins or better, six NBA Finals appearances, and five NBA titles. But what makes him so special? First, there are the things he refuses to take credit for. His greatest basketball achievement, to my mind, wasn't the cascade of brilliant draft picks, like snagging Manu Ginobili with the 57th pick in 1999 or Tony Parker with the 28st pick in 2001. His greatest basketball achievement hasn't been the relentlessly smart moves, like the swing-for-the-fences trade that brought the Spurs Kawhi Leonard or the trades that bring struggling talents (the most recent being Boris Diaw) from elsewhere to breathe new life into their careers in San Antonio. His greatest basketball achievement wasn't building championship teams that would strangle opposing offenses to the point that their philosophy was putting their opponents through ""48 minutes of hell."" Popovich's genius has been in his defiance of NBA wisdom. NBA wisdom holds that players can carry championship teams until they simply can't anymore, and when that time comes they should be let go. Conventional NBA wisdom holds that defense wins championships. As recently as 2008, when the Celtics had just clinched a championship with a defense-fueled rout of the Lakers, Boston fans began spontaneously bellowing ""DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE!"" because it had delivered them to the promised land.But Popovich didn't trade Tim, Tony, or Manu; he kept tinkering and kept building. Basketball is about scoring more points than the other team, and Popovich was going to win with the players who brought him so much success in the first place. He picked up role players, ran a smart system, built around Tim Duncan, and kept doing things his way. The Spurs Way.And it worked. His team had a championship snatched from under their noses in 2013, and he pulled them up off the mat. They battled to the 2014 Finals and dismantled the Heat's superior athleticism and defense with an avalanche of beautifully played offense.Go back and listen to Popovich talking to his Spurs in timeouts during the 2014 NBA finals. In Games 1 and 2, especially, before the Spurs made a joke of it, he wasn't preaching defense like most coaches in his situation, or even preaching defense like he would have with the Spurs' early-2000s championship teams. Popovich wasn't going on about locking the Heat down or defending with energy or getting a stop. Pop was stressing principles of offense. He was talking about sharp passes, taking care of the ball, crispness of curls off screens. He was talking about execution, not disruption.The Spurs, the defending champions as they are built right now, are the first team in recent memory to win by simply cranking up the offense. Popovich built a scoring machine: a crowd-pleasing, age-serving engine. Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker don't have to run the way they ran on defense when the Spurs choked opponents to death. All they have to do is use their veterans' wiles to score in the most beautifully constructed scoring machine that I think the NBA has ever seen.But he'll go to his grave telling us that he was handed some incredible players and all he did was not screw it up. That's Pop. And I think the best way to capture why he's so special is to listen to him talk about just what he's done. There are two quotes I love, and two that are quintessential Pop, in the video below. On what it really takes to win, and why he doesn't watch a lot of film during the regular season, at 5:30: ""It's the same stuff, every day. Whoever executes the best, whoever is the most competitive, and does both on a consistent basis for more of the 48 (minutes), that's the team that wins. Take it to the bank.""And on how he treats player development, at 6:16: ""Our method is usually tough love. I don't think coddling someone, blowing smoke at them, really works, and beating them to death mentally doesn't really work. So to give them a clear picture of what's demanded and needed is the first important thing, and then showing the care and concern after that. Being there for them on the court, caring about what they do off the court, understanding who they are on the planet, what makes them tick, you do all that. And if that doesn't get through, get rid of 'em.""It's why he's so special. He himself has said he's not a basketball lifer, that this is his job and he loves it but the day will come -- and, unfortunately, it will come soon -- that he walks away for good. And when he's gone, we'll miss him because Pop is special. He's never done this for love of the game. He's reached milestone after milestone, including this latest one, by first, foremost, and always treating his team like family."

Some have been determined as suicides, others involved automobile wrecks and more are awaiting causes. Students and faculty alike have voiced their concerns on how to handle the tragedies as a university. Nonetheless, the university has said the Appalachian State community will stay strong as a family.The university has increased its counseling services and offers on-call support for all students, but some students are taking a different approach to find comfort. Sophomore Samantha Bender -- a university ambassador, orientation leader and cheerleader -- was impacted when a fellow student, whom she saw daily, took her life last September. Bender wondered if she would have made a difference by telling the student she was beautiful and loved, thus the idea to spread positivity on campus emerged.In an effort to ignite positivity campus-wide Bender created an event on Feb. 9 entitled ""Positive Post-It Note Day,"" in which anyone on campus can ""write something encouraging on a post-it note and stick it somewhere on campus to remind other they are worthy and loved."" What began as a simple idea turned into a campus-wide event almost overnight. Thousands of vibrant colored notes were posted across campus -- some included funny pick-me-ups, others encouraging words of motivation, while more featured memorable quotes. Bender described it as ""a blur of colorful optimism."" All with one collective purpose: to [hopefully] change someone's life.""Certainly what we have gone through this year as a student body, as a family, has been something that no one should ever have to go through,"" says junior and student director of orientation, Amanda Torrence. ""However, the constant support we get from each other, the growing support we're receiving from the administration, and the way we've all come together through events like Positive Post-It Day shows that we are a strong, united family that can and will continue to grow closer."" Torrence says it is necessary for everyone in the Appalachian family to lift each other up in dark times, such as the community has done through this event.

Recognizing access to water as a human right means this is no longer an issue of charity. Denying people water is also tantamount to denying them the right to life.,2015-02-10,"DETROIT, MI - JULY 18 : Congressman John Conyers, Jr., (D-Mich.) clinches his fist as he joins demonstrators protesting against the Detroit Water and Sewer Department July 18, 2014 in Detroit, Michigan. The Detroit Water and Sewer Department have disconnected water to thousands of Detroit residents who are delinquent with their bills. (Photo by Joshua Lott/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e81b3c000066000dfe75.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"World leaders at the Davos World Economic Forum last month identified the scarcity of water as the leading threat facing the world over the next decade. Roughly 750 million people around the world lack access to clean water. In addition, more than 300 million people die each year from diseases related to unsafe water. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia lose 5 percent to 6 percent of their gross domestic products each year because they lack safe water and sanitation. For women and children, problems stemming from lack of access to water or poor water infrastructure are magnified further -- globally, they spend 140 million hours every day collecting water. In many places, women and children are at risk of violent attack when they journey to collect water.These harsh realities fly in the face of the fact that there is sufficient water to satisfy needs in every country. The problem is much more about equitable distribution. Overall, household water consumption accounts for only 10 percent of total water use in the world, while industry and agriculture are the largest water users.For advocates searching for solutions to the world water crisis and to equitable economic development, the global recognition of access to water as a human right is part of the answer. Recognizing access to water as a human right means this is no longer an issue of charity. Individuals are rights-holders and governments have obligations that must be met. Of course, defining any human right is a daunting task. The complexities when dealing with water are inevitable. Yet, denying people water is also tantamount to denying them the right to life.The philosophical basis for a human right to water begins with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states in Article 3 that, ""Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person."" It also states in Article 25 that, ""Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family,"" an assertion reiterated in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In 2010, the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council explicitly recognized the human right to water and sanitation. The United Nations has a special expert appointed by the Human Rights Council on the topic--a Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. In addition, roughly 30 countries have a constitutional or legal provision ensuring individuals' access to water. In South Africa, for example, the right to access sufficient water is enshrined in the constitution.Yet, a human right to water remains controversial. A number of countries, including the U.S., worked against a key United Nations 2010 General Assembly resolution relating to the right to water, out of fear that it would obligate them to share their water resources with other countries. Other nations and interests would rather have access to water articulated as a basic need -- or even a commodity -- rather than a right. Without delving into intricacies of the evolution of global human rights law associated with the human right to water, it is clear that this framework requires a focus on the most marginalized and disadvantaged communities as well as an emphasis on participation, empowerment and transparency. It is no secret that access to water unduly affects the poor, even in the U.S. In 2013, the U.S. Conference of Mayors stated that costs of building and maintaining water and wastewater infrastructure have been ""borne disproportionately by households with low, moderate or fixed incomes through increased user rates.""The human right to water raises a myriad of other issues. Chief amongst them are: What is the role of government? Do states have to provide services free of charge? Aren't costs going to be prohibitive?The emerging international consensus is that ""Human rights do not require States to directly provide individuals with water and sanitation. Their primary obligation is to create ""an environment conducive to the realisation of human rights."" Only in certain limited situations, such as a disaster, when people for reasons beyond their control are unable to access water and sanitation is a nation obliged to provide services. Nor is water required to be provided free of charge. In general, water should be accessible, affordable and safe for consumption.Recent events have further catalyzed discussions around the human rights to water.In 2013, in Zimbabwe's capitol city of Harare, residents had limited access to clean water and sanitation services, forcing them to drink from shallow wells contaminated with sewage. The government disconnected scores of residents from water supplies for being unable to pay -- even when they were being charged for sporadic service. More recently, in Haiti, more than three-quarters of schools lack access to water, increasing the risks of water-borne diseases and lessening time the country's students spend in school. In the U.S., water problems arose in March 2014 in Detroit. After the City Council approved an 8.7 percent increase in water rates -- which brought prices to almost double the U.S. average -- the city began to shut off water to residents who were more than 60 days behind on their payments or owed more than $150. Residents filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the city. The judge presiding over the case held that although water is necessary to sustaining life, residents had no enforceable right to water.Human Rights Watch has called attention to each of these issues. They described the situation in Detroit as being ""out of step with the emerging international consensus on the human right to water."" In the case of Detroit, Human Rights Watch stated ""while international law does not require that governments provide water for ""free""--utility services must of course be able to cover costs -- United Nations expert bodies have established that water should be affordable."" In the case of Zimbabwe, they have argued that government should invest in low-cost water and sanitation infrastructure. ""A sliding fee scale for municipal water should be put in place,"" they said, ""to provide affordable water for low-income families, and no home should be disconnected from the city water supply for lack of payment."" We all know that water is necessary for a green planet, sustainable economic growth and the eradication of poverty. Halving the number of individuals without access to water was listed as a target of global development goals reflected in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Although the next set of development goals has not been finalized yet, experts at the United Nations have recommended that achieving universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene should be included in this plan. Given that life as we know it cannot exist without water, we are all challenged to be part of the solution to ensure at least access to affordable water for all. Water should never be regarded as the privilege of the few."

Seven of the eight cases so far found in Cook County are associated with a daycare center in the city of Palatine.Georgia health officials reported that an infant arriving in Atlanta from outside the United States was confirmed to have measles, marking the state's first reported case of the disease since 2012.The Georgia case is unrelated to a California outbreak that health officials believe began with a person from outside the United States who visited the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim in late December.Georgia health officials are working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify anyone who may have been exposed to measles from the infant, the Georgia Department of Public Health said.According to the California Department of Public Health, 39 of the state's 107 confirmed cases have been linked to the Disneyland cluster.The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated.Some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated for religious or other reasons.Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But last year, the country had its highest number of measles cases in two decades.Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases.

Kennedy Library and Museum, Monday, Sept. 15, 2014, in Boston. Redford discussed issues on his career that has included acting, film direction, producing, environmental issues and civil rights. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c4fa3c000020010d073d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- President Barack Obama is an avid reader of the New York Times opinion section and has, on several occasions, invited two of his favorite columnists -- Tom Friedman and David Brooks -- over to the White House before rolling out major policy initiatives.But Obama is apparently not a fan of Maureen Dowd, another high-profile writer in the Times opinion stable. Former top Obama adviser David Axelrod wrote in Believer, his memoir published Tuesday, that ""no one got under Barack’s skin more than Maureen,"" and suggested she altered her coverage after a tense meeting with the president, a charge she rejects.Axelrod recalled how Dowd was granted a brief interview during an overseas 2008 campaign trip with then-candidate Obama. When the two were together, he wrote, Obama ""proceeded to blister her for a previous column she had written.""The former adviser wrote that Dowd's ""penchant for delving into the psyches of her subjects was particularly irritating to the self-possessed Obama.""""Normally polite under any circumstances, he was patronizing and disrespectful to Maureen in a way I had rarely seen,"" Axelrod continued. ""This was not well received by Dowd who, like most journalists, was accustomed to firing off salvos, yet decidedly uncomfortable when fired upon herself. After that awkward encounter, she seemed to take particular delight in psychoanalyzing Barack and belittling him in print, which only deepened his contempt. Maureen, who is as gracious and loyal to her friends as she is rough on the high and mighty, would become a friend of mine in Washington, which became a minor source of tension with Obama. ‘Why are you friends with her?’ he would demand after Maureen sent one of her acid darts his way.”Dowd said in an email to The Huffington Post that she remembered the exchange with Obama, but denied that she had changed her approach to covering him as a result.“I write about him according to how he's doing, not how he's treating me,"" Dowd wrote. “The idea that I punished him for giving me his opinion is not true and plays into an unfortunate stereotype of women, the Furies swooping down.”Axelrod didn’t specify which 2008 column particularly rankled Obama, but Dowd did write about Obama’s big foreign trip during the campaign.In a July 20 column from Washington --  “Ich Bin Ein Jet-Setter” -- Dowd described Obama gearing up for the trip through Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, Israel and Germany in mythological terms. Obama, she wrote, “has to swiftly and convincingly perform the political equivalent of the Labors of Hercules.” In her next column, written July 23 from Jerusalem, Dowd asked whether “The One” -- as Sen. John McCain’s campaign had mockingly described the Democratic nominee -- was “cocky or commander in chiefy?”“If you look at my columns before and after that meeting, there's the same mix of sweet and tart,” Dowd told HuffPost. “In my column the day after the election, ""Bring On The Puppy and The Rookie,'' I wrote about ""the elegant and disciplined Obama"" who ""has the chance to make the White House pristine again.'' In my Inaugural column, I wrote about ""the cool new president'' making Washington ""wholly, happily integrated.""While Dowd did score an invite from Obama after the heated exchange on the plane, gathering with several other columnists and the president-elect a week before 2009 inauguration, she hasn't been among the columnists at Obama's more recent off-the-record discussions at the White House. Dowd acknowledged that her columns grew more critical of Obama through his first six years in office, but said the shift was a reflection on his “governing and leadership, not my relationship with him.” ""If anyone acted out of spite, I'd say it was the White House, which ... no longer invites me to the President's background briefings for the columnists while continuing to invite my male colleagues, even though they, too, have written some critical things about the President,"" Dowd said. ""But here again, while I'd like to be included, that is not a consideration in what I write.""This article was updated after publication to include comment from Maureen Dowd."

On Monday, the U.S. Department of State announced Denis Cuspert is now a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The U.S. says Cuspert, 39, who goes by the name ""Abu Talha al-Almani,"" appears to be a recruiter for the militant group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. He has appeared in numerous videos for the Islamic State, including one from early November in which he holds the severed head of a man who supposedly opposed the organization. From the Department of State: Cuspert has pledged an oath of loyalty to ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and appears to serve as an ISIL recruiter with special emphasis on recruiting German speakers to ISIL. Cuspert is emblematic of the type of foreign recruit ISIL seeks for its ranks – individuals who have engaged in criminal activity in their home countries who then travel to Iraq and Syria to commit far worse crimes against the people of those countries ... Cuspert has been a willing pitchman for ISIL atrocities. Cuspert is also wanted by the German government on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities in his home country.Denis Cuspert was born in 1975 to Ghanian and German parents, according to Germany's Local newspaper. He rapped under the name ""Deso Dogg"" in Berlin as far back as 2002 but began associating with extremists in 2010. Two years later, he left to join the Islamic State in Syria. The former hip-hop artist, who achieved modest success in Germany and even toured with rapper DMX, has since spoken out against his old life in propaganda for the group, according to Yahoo!. ""I was a sinner. I lived in sin before I turned to Islam. Surrounded by music, drugs, alcohol and women,"" he said in one video, urging Muslims around the world to join the Islamic State caliphate. According to the International Centre For Radicalisation Studies, the number of foreign fighters from western countries who have joined militants in Syria and Iraq, including the Islamic State group, has risen to almost 4,000. Between 500 and 600 of them are Germans. Iraq expert Falko Walde told Germany's Die Welt that the Islamic State's western fighters are important to the group for propaganda purposes. ""It's important for the terror group to say its fighters are not just from Iraq, Syria and the Gulf states, but also from Europe,"" Walde said. "

We all wish we were like the media mogul when it comes to crafting and cooking, but in case you hadn't noticed, she looks pretty darn good too. At 73, the former model  has incredible hair and glowing skin that we all can covet. Stewart shares her beauty tips in the latest issue of her namesake magazine, Martha Stewart Living. Stewart revealed she's a true skincare and haircare devotee, waking up at 4 a.m. to apply her daily face mask. With dedication like that, she deserves a flawless complexion. She says she often gets complimented for her hair as well as her skin, saying hair shouldn't be neglected when it comes to anti-aging. While she uses a smattering of high-end beauty products, from Skinceuticals to Cle de Peau, there's one thing she relies on that we all have on hand: Johnson's baby oil. “I always have Johnson’s Baby Oil in my medicine cabinet. At night, I wash my face really well, because I have to have my makeup done a lot,” Stewart told People.  Johnson’s Baby Oil with a warm washcloth is one great way to take it off. I like oil because it keeps my skin very moist, and it works for me. I don’t get clogged pores.”Stewart also said she gears up for photo shoots by nixing the alcohol, being diligent with her workouts and, of course, getting plenty of shuteye. The DIY-guru's beauty regimen has been of interest for many, with some calculations estimating she spends around $2,000 on her anti-aging arsenal. But it's not just lotions and potions that keep her looking youthful. Stewart told The New York Times she religiously works out and does yoga and drinks a green juice every morning. ""You can be the most beautiful person on earth, and if you don’t have a fitness or diet routine, you won’t be beautiful,"" Stewart said. Well, there you have it.

(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb60053240000510056962f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Life for abortion clinic staff has become increasingly dangerous since 2010.Published in October 2014, the Feminist Majority Foundation's 2014 National Clinic Violence survey found that abortion clinic doctors and nurses reported higher instances of intimidation tactics and stalking than in prior years. The research included 242 abortion providers nationwide, with participants such as Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Abortion Care Network and other independent, unaffiliated clinics. The survey found that nearly 70 percent of abortion providers said they experience frequent harassment.Abortion clinics also reported a 25.3 percent overall increase in ""threats and targeted intimidation tactics"" between 2010 and 2014. FMF researchers defined these threats and targeted intimidation acts as distributing pamphlets that personally threaten doctors, releasing personal information of staff, picketing homes of staffers, posting flyers that read ""Killer Among Us"" with photos of doctors' faces, and releasing doctors' personal information on the Internet. The survey found that physicians reported increased stalking by anti-abortion protesters between 2010 and 2014, as well as many more instances of their personal information being posted on the Internet. Anti-abortion protesters are also creating more ""Wanted"" and ""Killers Among Us""-type pamphlets, featuring doctors' and nurses' personal information as a means to threaten and intimidate staff.  Stalking increased from 6.4 percent in 2010 to 8.7 percent in 2014, and personal information being posted on the Internet as a form of harassment increased from 8.9 percent to 17.8 percent.""The steep increase in the targeted intimidation of doctors and staff is striking and of great concern, as these types of true threats have all too often in the past preceded the use of deadly violence,"" the authors wrote, explaining why the use of these pamphlets is specifically unsettling. ""Beginning in the early 1990s, an undeniable pattern emerged between the use of WANTED posters and the murder of the doctors named on the posters. Drs. Gunn, Britton, Slepian and Tiller were all murdered by anti-abortion extremists; all had been featured prior to their murder on WANTED posters with their home and clinic addresses and in some cases, their photographs."" While the survey didn't look at the reason for the uptick in threats in recent years, researchers gave an interesting explanation for why many abortion clinics experience high levels of violence and harassment in the first place. Abortion providers that are in close proximity to Crisis Pregnancy Centers, or CPCs, are ""nearly twice as likely to experience higher rates of severe violence than a clinic not near a CPC,"" FMF wrote. Abortion providers located near a CPC were also more likely to experience more ""frequent incidents of violence and harassment.""CPCs are organizations that advertise pregnancy services but do not offer abortions, contraception or prenatal care. Instead, their staff attempts to talk women out of having an abortion, often communicating medically inaccurate information about contraception and the effects of having an abortion. Eleanor Smeal, founder and president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, told The Huffington Post that although FMF can't quantify how bad the effects of Crisis Pregnancy Centers are on abortion providers, she definitely believes CPCs are a large reason for these targeted threats and intimidation tactics. The organizations are part of a network of about 2,500 Christian-affiliated centers across the U.S., and most pop up near abortion providers. These intimidation tactics don't just hurt and scare abortion providers, they also affect the patients these clinics treat. Women who may just be visiting the clinic for a routine checkup often have to walk through protests and blockades, and may themselves become the targets of harassment from anti-abortion protesters. Women who are visiting the clinic for an abortion procedure have to endure this intimidation while making the very private decision to terminate a pregnancy. Adding to the concern, buffer zones -- areas designated around clinics to keep anti-abortion protesters a safe distance away from patients -- are crumbling around the U.S.“I think the average legislator, and certainly the average citizen, has no idea what is really happening to the abortion providers who care for women’s comprehensive reproductive health. If they did, they would be truly horrified,” duVergne Gaines, an author of the report and the director of the National Clinic Access Project, told ThinkProgress.Head over to the Feminist Majority Foundation to learn about their Clinics Access Project and how to help combat abortion clinic violence.

Kanye West performed both ""Only One"" and ""FourFiveSeconds,"" his collaboration with Rihanna and Sir Paul McCartney, on Sunday night.""Only One,"" which West wrote from the perspective of his late mother, Donda, was first. The Grammys teased that West's first song would be ""a never-before-seen solo performance,"" but that proved sort of untrue. West already performed ""Only One"" in concert last weekend.""FourFiveSeconds,"" which will appear on forthcoming albums by West and Rihanna, was next. West was joined by Rihanna for the track, with McCartney accompanying on guitar (and hand claps). The Grammys waited until the veritable last minute to announce West's presence. He was added to the star-studded bill on Tuesday morning and immediately became one of the best reasons to watch the show. His last Grammys appearance came in 2009, when he performed ""American Boy"" with Estelle and ""Swagga Like Us"" with Jay Z, T.I., Lil Wayne and M.I.A. (he even helped announce the winner in that year's Best New Artist category). Since, West has been outspoken against The Recording Academy, especially after ""Yeezus"" was snubbed in the top categories at last year's ceremony.""I’m 36 years old and I have 21 Grammys,"" West said during a concert in 2013. ""That’s the most Grammys of any 36-year-old. Out of all of those 21 Grammys, I’ve never won a Grammy against a white artist. ... So when the Grammys nominations come out, and 'Yeezus' is the top one or two album on every single list, but only gets two nominations from the Grammys, what are they trying to say? Do they think that I wouldn’t notice? Do they think that, someway, that I don’t have the power to completely diminish all of their credibility at this moment?""Continued West: ""But no, no. Only positive energy, only positive vibes. But when you see me talking about what people are doing when I say 'marginalized,' when I say 'boxed in,' when I say 'hold back,' when I say 'people are afraid of the truth,' that’s one example right in front of you. And people come to me and they congratulate me on those two nominations. Fuck those nominations."""
