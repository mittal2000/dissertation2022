0,HOME & LIVING,5 Reasons to Love Plywood,"Philip Schmidt, Contributor
Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/plywood-diy-ideas_us_5b9c7293e4b03a1dcc7eb7f4,There are plenty of reasons to consider using plywood for your next DIY project.,2012-10-25,Interior framing of a new house under construction,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c729326000036007f7b64.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ever heard of Alvar Aalto? How about Gerald Summers? Ok, here's an easy one: Charles Eames. Aside from being pioneers of modern furniture, there's one thing these designers had in common: They all loved plywood so much, that they devoted a good part of their careers to cutting it, steaming it, gluing it, bending it, molding it, coaxing it -- and probably a lot of praying for it -- to get it to do just what they wanted it to do. And in the end, plywood came through for them. That's why we have such seminal pieces as Eames' LCW chair and Sori Yanagi's Butterfly Stool, as well as plenty of accessible designs, like Ikea's Po√§ng chair, by Noboru Nakamura. If that's not enough to warm you up to engineered wood, here are some other reasons to consider using plywood for your next DIY project or groundbreaking modern (or traditional) creation. 1. It's good lookin'. Don't forget, plywood is real wood. The inner layers may be made with utility-grade material, but the outer veneers can be just as rich and lustrous as a plank of solid cherry. Or hickory, apple, alder, mahogany, walnut, afromosia... If you've heard of a species of wood, chances are you can find it covering a panel of plywood. You can also get plywood made entirely of bamboo (which, technically, is a grass), and it's reeeaaal perty. Edged with hardwood trim, a plywood sheet assumes the appearance of solid wood, but modern designers prefer to show off the material's stratified edges. The even layering of dark and light wood lends a crisp, linear detail to any project and reminds us that plywood is both a natural and man-made animal. 2. It's cheap and it's big.  ""Cheap"" is relative, I know. And if you've recently called your local lumber supplier for a quote on a sheet of maple plywood, you might still be reeling from sticker shock. But here's why plywood is a good deal: A full 4-by-8-foot sheet of 3/4-inch plywood in a standard species, like oak or birch, costs about $70 to $80 (that's for the good stuff, not the big-box stuff). That might seem pricey to some, but what you're getting is 32 square feet (or 24 board feet) of usable material, provided you make it home without the panel tearing the roof rack off your car. There are no dinged or cracked edges to cut off, no out-of-square ends, no mill marks, no knots -- it's all useable material. By contrast, solid-wood boards often bear many of these flaws, or you'll pay extra for super-clean material. The price for 3/4-inch oak or birch stock starts at about $6 per board foot, or $144 for 24 board feet. I have nothing against solid lumber, and it's clearly the best choice for many applications, but the value of plywood, for so many other uses, is hard to deny... or resist. The substantial size of plywood means something else: loads of design potential. For example, I've used a single 4-by-8-foot sheet of ply to make a pair of 84-inch-tall closet doors (too tall for standard prefab doors). A 5-by-5-foot panel of Baltic birch became a one-piece headboard for my queen-size bed, with plenty of material left over. One of the designers in my book turned a single sheet of plywood into a 40-by-72-inch dining table, and he had enough cutoff material to build up the edges so the tabletop appears to be 1 1/2-inch thick. That's a lot of project for $80. 3. It's reliable. Wood is a lovably and maddeningly fickle material. It swells and stretches with humidity. Often, it bows, cups or twists due to internal stresses that are hard to predict or prevent. And knots definitely are not without their challenges. Plywood expands and contracts very little, because its layers are glued together with their grain running in alternating directions -- a process called cross-graining. This also helps prevent warping and other bad habits of wood. Knots typically aren't a problem because plywood face veneers (on at least one side of the panel) don't have any. You can run into knots in the interior plies, but these tend to be small and usually don't affect your finish. All of this means that plywood is exceptionally user-friendly.4. It's bendy... and it's not. One of the best examples of plywood's unique qualities is the skateboard deck. After over four decades of skateboard production and countless advances in building materials, decks are still made with good ol' plywood for four primary reasons: it's lightweight, it's moldable, it's strong and it's elastic. And, as mentioned above, it's also attractive -- and all skaters know that a new deck has to look absolutely beautiful before you start abusing the hell out of it. In its many forms, plywood can be as supple as posterboard and as rigid as hardwood. Use 3/4-inch or even 1-inch ply to make a coffee table or a countertop. Use 1/8-inch ply for laminated projects or anything with curves. There's even a type called ""bendy plywood,"" which is made with three or more layers with all of the wood grain running in the same direction (as opposed to cross-grained), making it especially flexible. 5. It's resource-efficient.  Generally speaking, plywood is made with very thin sheets of wood sliced from logs, and mostly from logs that wouldn't make very good solid lumber. Even when cutting from nicer material for the pretty face veneers, you get a lot of mileage out of a log, as the faces are only about 1/32-inches thick. Yes, there's a fair amount of industrial processing involved in making a finished plywood panel, but when you consider the time is takes to grow hardwood trees, resources used in the factory seem insignificant. As America and the rest of the world continues to move toward sustainable building materials, plywood is certain to stay near the top of stack."

And she did it all in style. Hillary, who celebrates her 65th on Friday, has always had a distinct fashion sense, one that both incorporates trends (hello, giant glasses) and stays true to who she is (what up, pantsuits).

Medical journals should ensure industry role contributions be fully disclosed,"" the committee's report said. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican and senior member of the committee, said in a statement: ""The findings also should prompt medical journals to take a very proactive approach to accounting for the content of the articles, along with the authorship of the articles and studies they feature.""The Senate committee, which has sole jurisdiction over U.S. government health programs Medicare and Medicaid, accused the company of wrongly promoting Infuse, a genetically engineered protein used in spinal surgery, as a better technique than bone grafts from the pelvis.In response, Medtronic said in a statement on its website it ""vigorously disagreed"" with the allegations of influencing or authoring the publications or under-reporting adverse events.""In addition, the report's characterization of payments received by physicians is also misleading and unfair,"" Medtronic said.The inquiry by the Senate Committee began in June last year, investigating whether surgeons paid by Medtronic did not report complications associated with Infuse.The Spine Journal reported at that time that 13 Medtronic-sponsored studies related to Infuse had reported no adverse events.""While the report confirms what was reported in the June 2011 issue of The Spine Journal, the committee's access to Medtronic's internal documents presents a more detailed and disturbing picture of what can go wrong when ethics and patient safety are compromised for profit,"" the North American Spine Society said in a statement.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Infuse in 2002 to stimulate spinal bone growth in patients with a degenerative disease affecting the lower spine.However, the product is used mostly off-label, often for repairs to the cervical, or neck, spinal area.According to Medtronic, Infuse has been used to treat more than 500,000 patients and generated sales of about $800 million in fiscal 2011.Robin Young, whose firm RRY Publications publishes Orthopedics This Week, said he believes Medtronic, which makes a host of other non-orthopedic medical devices, has improved its practices substantially in recent years.""Medtronic went through strict compliance changes. It was a top-to-bottom commitment to compliance, with wholesale changes. It's a multi-year process and a change of culture, and it's much different than it was even seven years ago,"" Young said.Shares of Medtronic were trading at $41.97, up 28 cents, in early activity on the New York Stock Exchange."

The two were on opposite sides of the globe when the news broke -- she in Australia shooting ""Dancing With The Stars"", and he in Los Angeles shooting the film ""Noah."" Their whereabouts might be an indication of what went wrong in their marriage. Did their careers take priority over their personal lives?You have to ask yourself the question: which comes first, my home life or my work? Sometimes there's no easy answer. There is a time in many people's lives when they wonder if they've compromised one for the other. Everyone who has a passion for what they do has struggled to balance work and family. For celebrities, the choice can be particularly hard since their projects often take them far away for long periods of time, but you don't have to be a star to grapple with this tug-of-war.This dilemma can strike at different stages of people's lives: being too busy to find love, being taken away from a boyfriend or new spouse by work demands, or having to choose between your children and your job. At some point, you will most likely be forced to make a decision. So the question becomes: How much is too much? And how much of a toll does work take?Having a career certainly shouldn't preclude you from having a fulfilling romantic and home life, but sometimes people become so consumed with their work that it depletes the energy that they might otherwise be able to spend on personal commitments. For example, Abigail, one of my patients, completely threw herself into her work. Because she could make time only for the occasional date, it became impossible for her to develop a real relationship. She feels there is no other option for her but to take on more creative responsibility if she wants to build her career and continue to move up the ladder. The risk, however, is that if she doesn't make some room now for her romantic life, she may lose the opportunity to have one. What if you're the person left at home repeatedly, as my patient Ellen and her baby recently were while her husband worked on a big project? Or what if your boyfriend has to move to another city in order to tackle his new promotion? In fact, when my patient Claire's boyfriend moved, he was working toward financial stability so he could feel secure and ready to propose to her. However, she took it personally and thought he wasn't committed to the relationship because he moved away. It is easy to feel that your partner is choosing the office over you; they, however, typically don't see it as a choice but rather their professional responsibility. If this is going on with the person you are dating or married to, try to step back and consider what's motivating them to invest so much energy into their work. Also, it might be helpful to have a conversation with them to see if they can put some checks and balances in place at work in order to make some personal time. If you're the one who's been overwhelmed with work and not making it home until after 9:00 p.m. or missing a Friday night with your family, give your loved one fair warning. That way, they can make other plans and not feel ignored or abandoned. It is important to take the time to figure out your work-life balance. You will want to preserve the emotional intimacy you share with your partner because that can ultimately help sustain you as you make your way in the world -- and up the corporate ladder.

From industrial outskirts of Richmond to the pastoral landscapes of the Blue Ridge Mountains and beyond, an army of Virginia artisans are turning their love of beer into business. With about 40 craft breweries in the state, Virginia pales in comparison to states like California, Oregon and Colorado. But craft brewers in Virginia hope to build on the success of the state's wine industry, which has seen steady growth in recent years and continues to attract tourists seeking to enjoy the concoctions made by Virginia craftsmen. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c6fb2240000500094ac90.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Craft beer festivals have been taking over event spaces nationwide, popping up year round to offer the palates of beer connoisseurs new and unique ales and lagers for sampling. An ever-expanding industry, craft beer has been rapidly making its way into beer lovers' hearts and refrigerators over the past few years, replacing six packs of Budweiser with artisanal IPAs.Come November 10th, 2012, the New York City Craft Beer Festival, Winter Harvest Edition, will take residence on Pier 57 to offer tastings of seasonal brews from nearly 75 breweries. Additionally, experts will be on hand to host seminars on topics such as beer and food pairings, just in time for holiday parties.""We work to appeal to the serious beer nerd who wants to learn more about American Craft Beer,"" Robert Howell Jr., one of the planners behind the festival, states. ""We stick to our NYC Craft Beer Festival mantra of 'Seasonal, Unique, Limited Release.' Our Holy Grail is if we can get all 3 of those characteristics in each beer.""""Our guests bring notepads and make tasting notes,"" Howell shares further. ""Craft Beer aficionados have very sophisticated palates, and a deep desire to learn more about craft beer.""For a more in-depth understanding of the craft beer industry, I spoke to Jim Pickett, the NYC Craft Beer Festival's beer curator.  Stats show that there has been a 12 percent increase in the sale of craft beer this year. What sparked the revolution?   Only 12 percent? The last several years the industry has seen annual growth of 25-40 percent at times. Even in the face of a nasty recession. This revolution has been brewing (pun intended) for a long time. I believe it all comes down to three things -- 1) a much more sophisticated palate in a broader consumer base, 2) a desire for more ""quality over quantity"" food and beverage, and 3) a wildly creative, experimental and technical craft brew industry. As consumers, we now have an amazing array of great tasting and well-made beers to choose from on a daily basis. Consumers have recognized and are rewarding craft brewers who deliver this myriad of excellent choices. Many craft beer aficionados are participants in the smartphone social media application UNTAPPD (myself included), where you ""check in"" the beer you're drinking, follow friend's selections, and gain suggestions and badges. Does social media have a large impact on the sales of craft beer?   Absolutely. Social media creates an uncensored forum of near immediate feedback on products. It not always un-biased, but there is so much input from so many sources that ultimately it levels out to great information at your fingertips anytime you want it. It is also (usually) very pleasing when you can connect with like-minded individuals. Social media allows people to do this with anyone around the globe. Social media also creates endless debate forums where people can promote and defend their passions and positions. In the past, brand information was dominated or controlled by big companies with big advertising and promotion budgets. Consumers were often misinformed or blinded by the smoke and mirrors or bells and whistles of traditional media. The Internet and social media have leveled the playing field and helped create a greater consumer democracy -- especially for small producers and craft products. Will the recent New Jersey law Governor Chris Christie signed in favor of microbreweries have a positive effect on craft beer? Will other states follow suit?   Absolutely. Changing or -- better yet -- ""modernizing"" the laws in support of craft brewing can only help. NY and PA craft industries have exploded and NJ has a very similar consumer base. For the breweries, I think it is more about the direct wholesale sales and quality sampling opportunities than having multiple locations. A good brewery doesn't need multiple locations, just fair and reasonable ways to market and sell their products. Also, tax reduction for the first 1,000 barrels helps encourage new brewery entry because its lowers the early fixed costs. What is the biggest challenge a craft brewery faces?   You would think that mainstream, watered-down, garbage beer and massive competitive marketing budgets would be the biggest challenges. I don't think that is the case. Most critical challenges are within the craft industry. I think there are two major challenges: 1) creating consistent, quality product with the ability to expand, and 2) establishing consumer awareness, a strong following and profitable volume in a marketplace that is rapidly becoming a hyper-competitive. You won't get past challenge two if you can't manage challenge one. Crap products will fade quickly. And the array of choices is staggering. Established craft breweries now make dozens of beers. Some breweries have brewed well over a hundred different beers. It can be overwhelming to consumers.  How do you see the industry evolving over the next few years?   I think a lot of the off-the-wall experimentation and ""pushing the limits' of beer styles will continue, but maybe not as crazy as it has been. There is a movement now towards beers that are a bit lighter in alcohol, still very flavorful and much more ""sessionable."" This will offer some balance of options to all the Imperial and higher alcohol styles that have been popular in recent years. I also feel the industry is going to cross-pollinate more and more with the burgeoning craft distilling (spirits) industry. It's already happening with barrel-aged beers and the distilling of beer into whiskies and other spirits. Both industries are similar in passion and creativity and are natural fits together or side by side. Sadly pumpkin beers are only available in the fall and since the NYC Craft Beer Fest is focusing on winter brews, will we still be able to sample pumpkin beers?   Yes. For very selfish interests, if you must know. I love pumpkin beers and think they should be available at least until Thanksgiving -- if not Christmas. They are released way too early in my opinion. Because of that, we will include the best of what is still available in our offerings at NYC Winter Harvest Craft Beer Fest. Our plan is to have the best available fall and holiday / winter beers garnished by a few staples from year-round offerings. What are the main differences between a winter beer and an autumn or Oktoberfest beer?   Autumn and Oktoberfest style beers tend to focus a bit more on richer malt character in the beers, which can be sweeter, nuttier and roasty-er. Winter beers tend to be a bit stronger and focus more on spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, Allspice, etc. Pumpkin is kind of in the middle of the two, though it leans a bit more towards spice. I really like both styles, but feel that the winter beers give craft brewers the chance to showcase their creativity with unique ingredients that are either local or indigenous to the US.  Hopheads are plentiful these days. Are IPAs the main seller in the craft beer world?   As a style category, yes. But craft beer lovers are an experimental bunch. They often drink beer according to mood, the same way people order and consume food according to preferences of the season or moment. IPAs are clearly a year-round favorite and that is what drives their volume, but there is endless array of styles and quality choices to satisfy any preference at any time. What are a few of your favorite IPAs? My craft beer career started in 1993 and Anchor Liberty was always one of my favorites. Brooklyn, Dogfish Head, Captain Lawrence, Southern Tier, Smuttynose, Victory, Stone, Lagunitas, Green Flash, Bear Republic -- to name a few more -- all make IPAs worthy of my hard-earned cash.  There is an insurgence of breweries making their IPAs ""extreme"" by double imperializing. How did this trend start and do you for see it lasting? I think hops are a very welcoming flavor and beer can be very enjoyable with more of it. So, I think it started as brewers trying increase the depth of hop flavor profile in the beers and it ended up yielding the higher octane ""imperial"" versions as a side effect. I think the trend to make more and more of them has somewhat peaked, but people like the style so I think it will stay and just level off a bit with the number of offerings.What are a few microbreweries hopheads should keep an eye on?   San Diego seems to be the epicenter of hops lately. Previously it was Northern California, but most craft breweries offer at least a couple ""hoppy"" beers. Stay in the loop at your local beer bars and stores. Those folks get to taste a lot of the new stuff as soon as it becomes available.What are the five beers everyone must sample at the NYC Craft Beer Fest?   Because of the nature of seasonal beers, we are still nailing down the best of what is available. These beers can come and go quickly and we are working closely with the distributors and breweries to secure the best offerings they have. We will be publishing our secured offerings shortly on our website and updating it regularly as we secure more. Keep your eye on that page and follow us on Twitter and we'll keep people posted. I suggest everyone makes their own Top 5 list, even with a festival that will likely sell out, odds are that no two lists will be the same.For more information and to purchase tickets to the NYC Craft Beer Festival taking place at Pier 57 on November 10th, 2012, visit: http://nyccraftbeerfest.comUpdate: Due to Superstorm Sandy, the NYC Craft Beer Festival will now take place  on December 1st, 2012 at Pier 36.

They are my insight into ""man-glish,"" and provide important insights as I navigate through the rocky, unfamiliar landscape of dating. I have heeded their advice too, because as a woman, I have always sucked at following ""The Rules"" outlined in the book written by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider. In this book, Fein and Schneider detail rules women should follow to get men into relationships that mostly involve some version of playing hard to get. Bill, one of my best ""man-glish"" teachers, advises me regularly and insists that men love the chase. And so when I receive a text message from Artist Guy at 9pm one night, I panic. ""Just just home from work."" Artist Guy writes. ""I could go to the gym. Or not.""I am frozen. Do I respond? Do I wait 10 minutes, then respond? Is two minutes too quickly? Do I respond tomorrow? And when I respond to Artist Guy, what do I write? What are the rules?After all, it is 9pm. Is this a text message a booty call? Or perhaps he simply wants to chat?I text Bill, desperate for guidance and relieved that in asking, I am buying a decent amount of time in the ""playing hard to get"" department.Bill responds, ""Girl, show Artist Guy you have a life!"" Show him I have a life? I do have a life. I am a single mother to three daughters. I have a job. Responsibilities for God's sake. And so I wonder, how could the timeliness in which I respond to a text demonstrate that I am busy? What happens, for example, if someone calls and I am technically ""available?"" Should I let it go to voicemail just so he will perceive me as busy? What, God forbid, if I actually want to talk to Artist Guy? A few weeks ago, I met Rock Star online. Apparently there are also online dating rules. And, of course, I suck at these too. According to Topdatingtips.com, online dating rules require that I don't initiate conversations via email in order to ""allow men to come to me."" Strike one: I emailed Rock Star first. Within minutes, Rock Star wrote back, asking for my phone number. According to the dating experts, I'm never supposed to provide a true phone number. However, I did -- strike two. And then I struck out. Always respond to emails at least three days after receipt, the website recommends. I wrote back instantly! Within thirty seconds, my phone was ringing. I answered immediately. Now I had allegedly outted myself as available, and -- according to our friends at ""Top Dating Tips"" -- desperate. For two weeks, Rock Star and I tried to meet. I, however, was busy. In fact, he had to ask me out three times before I was available. I was not playing hard to get. It's just that I am hard to get, because I have a full life. And when we did meet, it had to be after dinner plans I had with friends. Driving home at 11:00pm he texted, telling me he was finishing up with a client dinner and would call as soon as he was able. ""Hmm,"" I thought, knowing the experts would not approve if we were to meet that night. Arriving home, I resolved to follow the damn rules. I went upstairs and took my makeup off. I had saved myself, I thought. I could not meet him in yoga pants and an oversized gray t-shirt. I had not even shaved my legs. Jumping into bed, I grabbed the remote and settled into the pillows, confident that when he called I would tell him we would have to meet another time. Moments later the phone rang, and -- resolve gone -- I agreed to meet him at midnight.Hanging up I felt relief, not shame as I expected. I was going to hideously violate every rule ever written.Opening the door ten minutes later, my heart lunged and I smiled, looking into his eyes smiling back at mine. He was tall with a hint of scruff and small lines crinkled near the corners of his eyes. Within seconds, he was inside the doorway, pulling me into his arms tightly.That night we talked, laughed and made out like teenagers 'til 4am, recklessly breaking rule after rule with carefree abandon. I even let Rock Star sleep in my bed that night, delighting in the caresses of this man.Since that first date, I admit that I have on several occasions wanted to text Rock Star, or call him to tell him I am looking forward to our next date. I have, however, waited to be ""chased,"" allowing him to call first because he is a man who doesn't play games, and I know he will call. Rock Star isn't breaking rules by showing his interest in spending time with me, revealing his excitement to see me soon, or calling just to tell me he thinks I'm amazing. He is a man who, like me, sucks at ""the rules"" or more likely, isn't playing games anymore either.So to some, like Ms. Fein and Schneider, as well as the experts at TopDatingTips.com, I still suck at playing by ""the rules"" and at playing games with men. But the truth is, I don't suck. I'm just living my life and have ultimately decided that in my quest to be vulnerable, I am done playing games."

The number of people sickened by a deadly meningitis outbreak has now reached 119 cases, including 11 deaths, according to the CDC. The states involved in the outbreak are Tennessee, Michigan, Virginia, Indiana, Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey and Ohio. Officials have tied the outbreak of rare fungal meningitis to steroid shots for back pain.

But because the Massachusetts company is relatively small, patients exposed to meningitis are beginning to sue more well-insured defendants.Plaintiffs have sued at least two physicians and orthopedic clinics in New Jersey that provided the injections, and legal experts predict similar cases against other doctors and clinics.Such lawsuits, however, may hinge on whether courts define the tainted injections as products that were sold. In that case, hospitals and doctors could be sued for product liability and held responsible regardless of intent to harm. These strict standards are part of most state product liability laws.However, if courts define an injection as a service, plaintiffs likely would face the tougher task of showing negligence under medical malpractice laws.""The question will be whether the doctor or hospital failed to investigate the competence and safety of the steroids, and you'll have to put some flesh on those bones,"" said personal injury lawyer Fred Thompson of law firm Motley Rice.Motley Rice plans to sue NECC on behalf of meningitis plaintiffs in the next several days, said another attorney at the firm, Don Migliori. The lawsuits may expand over time to include other defendants, he said.In the New Jersey case, plaintiffs accused the physicians of negligence, but sought to invoke strict liability for the clinics, meaning the facility could be held liable for selling a defective product even without knowing of a defect.One of the clinics, Professional Pain Management Associates in Vineland, New Jersey, declined to comment, while the other clinics and doctors named as defendants were not immediately available to comment.To build a case under the legal standard of strict product liability, plaintiffs' lawyers may look at clients' medical bills, said New York personal injury lawyer David Jaroslawicz, who said he is not yet involved in any lawsuits linked to the meningitis outbreak.If a bill shows separate prices for the injection and the steroid, a plaintiff could argue that the steroid was a product sold. That argument may be harder if doctors only bill for the service or do not itemize, Jaroslawicz said.Twenty-three people have died and nearly 300 have been infected in the meningitis outbreak. Health regulators estimate as many as 14,000 people were exposed to the steroids, which were used as pain medications.NECC, the compounding pharmacy, has been sued by patients in states including Michigan, Minnesota and Tennessee. A company representative did not respond to a request for comment on the litigation.In one Massachusetts case, plaintiffs have tried to go after NECC's executives, seeking a court order to freeze the assets of company owners Barry and Lisa Cadden and Greg Conigliaro. DAMAGE CALCULATIONSProduct-liability claims against doctors or hospitals are not always allowed. In some states, doctors are protected from strict liability standards, and some states impose caps on damages for such claims, said Charles Joern, a Chicago lawyer who defends companies in product liability lawsuits.""That's going to play a role in determining where claims are filed,"" Joern said.Indeed, the issue of damages is central to personal injury litigation, and limits on damages can deter litigation.Compensatory damages, which cover a plaintiff's financial loss, are often modest. But plaintiffs usually seek punitive damages, designed to punish wrongdoers, which can be much higher.In practice, punitive damages can be difficult to win, except in extreme cases.""In New York, for example, unless a doctor comes in the room drunk and cuts off the wrong leg, it's hard,"" said Jaroslawicz. ""Most doctors, if they make a mistake, it's an honest mistake.""Because lawsuits are likely to be filed in multiple states, outcomes could vary. Plaintiffs may file claims for both product liability and malpractice, in hopes one or both stick, said Andrew Meyer, a personal injury lawyer at Massachusetts law firm Lubin & Meyer, which has been looking into potential cases on behalf of meningitis plaintiffs.Hospitals and doctors may not be the only defendants. Everyone in the supply chain, from suppliers to compounders to distributors, could face litigation, Meyer said.One entity unlikely to be sued is the federal government, said Motley Rice's Migliori.""You can point the finger and say these steroids should have been regulated better -- that's the big controversy,"" he said. ""But you can't say the government in this case failed to carry out a duty.""While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has limited authority to regulate pharmacies such as NECC, it has been under scrutiny because it had flagged violations at the company as recently as 2006.There is some precedent for successfully suing the government over faulty products, but only when the government played a key role in letting those products into the market, such as through negligent testing or regulation, Migliori explained.Lawsuits could target the Massachusetts state government, which had regulatory responsibility over NECC, but legal standards may be too rigorous for plaintiffs to overcome, Meyer said.""You can always make a claim, but the difficulties associated with suing any government, federal or state, are enormous,"" he said.
