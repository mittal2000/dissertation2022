Chuck Grassley took the stage at a Donald Trump rally Saturday, but the senior senator from Iowa didn't go so far to endorse the billionaire. Instead, he encouraged Iowa Republicans to go out and caucus.""We have an opportunity to make America great again,"" Grassley said, echoing Trump's campaign slogan.Grassley has made it clear in the past that he won't be making any endorsements ahead of the Iowa caucuses but said he ""appreciates Trump's support"" and is excited to see so many large crowds at campaign events around Iowa. Grassley's appearance at Trump's rally could signify that establishment Republicans realize they can no longer ignore the business mogul's momentum.""We've go to keep up this energy that's shown here today and many other places around Iowa,"" Grassley said as the crowd applauded.As the 82-year-old senator entered Dowstra Auditorium at Central College, reporters shouted questions, asking if he would make an endorsement.""I am here because I want to beat Hillary,"" Grassley responded.The senator went on to criticize President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.""We need a new commander and chief and that obviously is not Hillary,"" Grassley said. ""When you deal with a president that says 'I have a phone and a pen and it doesn't really matter that there is a Congress,' it really doesn't matter there is a Constitution... We've got a president who is out of control and a government that can soon be out of control.""As Grassley appeared at Trump's rally in Pella, rival Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was traveling to visit Grassley's hometown of New Hartford, two hours away.Also on HuffPost:"
1,WEIRD NEWS,Naming A Cockroach After Your Valentine Is Actually Really Romantic,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/name-cockroach-valentines-bronx-zoo_us_56a3b52ee4b076aadcc6d4d2,Roaches are pretty badass.,2016-01-23,Looks aren't everything. (Pictured: Madagascar hissing cockroach),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a3fc862a00002c00031294.jpeg?cache=y0KHMPEmTd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the sixth year running, the Bronx Zoo is offering die-hard romantics the chance to name a cockroach after their beloved for Valentine’s Day.The promotion gets a ton of press every year, probably because people find cockroaches so revolting that the whole idea seems pretty hilarious. Last year, a Buzzfeed writer suggested that instead of using the naming scheme to honor their loved ones, they use it as a way to get back at their exes. The San Francisco Zoo had the same idea, and marketed Valentine’s Day cockroach and scorpion naming rights as a way to tarnish the memory of ex-lovers.But really, the Bronx Zoo had the right idea to begin with. Having a cockroach -- in this case, one of the thousands of Madagascar hissing cockroaches that reside at the zoo -- named after you should be considered an honor, not an insult. Here are just a few reasons.Cockroaches are survivorsAnyone who’s ever dealt with a cockroach infestation knows how resilient these little guys and gals are. But instead of viewing that trait with frustration and hate, think about how incredibly freaking impressive it is. They can hold their breath for five to seven minutes at a time, develop resistance to pesticides in scarily fast time, and can survive harsh radiation that would destroy puny humans.Females are tough and independentIn the United States, the population of Surinam cockroaches (pictured above) is entirely female -- and they reproduce asexually.Under “severe conditions” when no males are available, the American cockroach can lay fertile eggs “with no male participation,"" according to the University of Massachusetts. You go, girl.We need cockroaches more than they need usOK, so maybe you don’t feel like you “need” roaches in your kitchen. That’s fair. But cockroaches in general play an important role in the ecosystem.“They eat decaying vegetation, decaying stuff, mostly,” entomologist Nancy Greig told The Houston Chronicle. “And if we didn't have them -- and the termites and dung beetles and decomposers -- the world would be piled high in trash. They're very important recyclers.”And after cockroaches digest that food, they return it to the soil via the nitrogen in their feces, which is crucial to the health of plants. “Extinction of cockroaches would have a big impact on forest health and therefore indirectly on all the species that live there,” biology professor Srini Kambhampati told Live Science.Plus, cockroaches are an important source of food for small mammals, which themselves are important food sources for larger mammals, Kambhampati said.In other words, cockroaches are total badasses and valuable members of society. If your significant other lives up to that, you’re lucky.Also on HuffPost:"

5,THE WORLDPOST,How Children Are Forced To The Front Lines Of Yemen's War,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yemen-child-soldiers_us_56a11eece4b0404eb8f09138,And what it means for the future of the country.,2016-01-23,"The war in Yemen has also sparked a humanitarian disaster. At least 2 million children in the country are out of school, according to UNICEF.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a12e1c2a00002c00031090.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with Julien Harneis, UNICEF's representative in Yemen.Throughout Yemen's turbulent history, children have been armed and sent into battle by an array of armed groups and regime forces.The international community has been trying to end the practice, and in recent years the U.N. successfully pushed the government and the rebel Houthi group to promise to stop the use of child soldiers.But last March, an advancing Houthi takeover prompted neighboring Saudi Arabia and a coalition of allies to launch airstrikes in support of Yemen's embattled government. Ten months later, the civil war has claimed the lives of more than 6,000 people, including over 700 children. The number of child fighters has swelled.Meanwhile, the war has sparked a humanitarian disaster in the country, already the poorest in the Arab World. Some 1.3 million children under 5 years old are at risk of malnutrition, and at least 2 million children are out of school, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).The WorldPost spoke to Julien Harneis, UNICEF's representative in Yemen, about how the war has pushed children into battle.Have children always participated in conflict in Yemen?It’s a long-term problem in Yemen. In Yemeni culture, it’s considered that you come into manhood at the age of 14 or 15 years old, and part of being a man is taking up a weapon. Yemen has the second-highest amount of arms per capita after the United States, so there’s a very strong gun culture in Yemeni society.However, this current conflict has exacerbated the problem. More children have been drawn into armed groups than was the case in the past. Now, there’s a war across the country and children are getting dragged into it.Are all sides of the conflict using child fighters?Certainly, it is something we see more frequently with the Houthis. However, we also see it with the [pro-government] popular committees in the south of Yemen. So it’s not limited to any one group.What is life like for a child fighter in Yemen -- do they get paid? Do they get sent into combat?They do receive a small payment. Many of the children are guarding checkpoints on roads -- in fact I saw some this morning. But they’re also on the front line fighting as well. Many children have been captured by rival armed groups, and progressively children are also being killed in fighting.What do you think is a realistic estimate for the number of child fighters in Yemen at the moment?It’s really not possible to say, unfortunately. That would require us to be able to travel around the country and do a count, and that’s not possible in this context. Based upon driving around and working in different parts of Yemen, I can say that there is a very significant proportion of the fighters who are children. Last year, you said up to one-third of fighters in armed groups were children. Does that still seem about right?It’s very hard to put a number on it, but when I say a significant proportion, it is getting towards that sort of number.The latest UN figures say at least 724 children were pressed into military activity. How does the UN reach that number?Those are verified numbers -- we identify a child associated with an armed group and double check to make sure that is correct. Because it requires a certain level of verification, it’s obviously a gross understatement of the reality. There are many, many more children who form part of armed groups.What are the main factors that lead children to join the ranks of the fighters? Part of it is social pressure. Children believe misguidedly that by doing this they’re doing the right thing by their society. Part of it is economic. Young children who join a fighting group receive a small amount of money, which encourages them to do so. However, we do see an increasing tendency for armed groups to go out and encourage children -- or even stronger than that, increase pressure on them -- to join the armed groups.Do children from all walks of life get recruited?It really depends on the conflict dynamics. When there was fighting in the southern city of Aden, children from urban areas were involved. There is a tendency towards children from more economically deprived backgrounds [joining armed groups], but we also have instances of children from middle-income families. It’s a fairly broad-based phenomenon. Before the war, the U.N. had made some progress in getting commitments from the government of Yemen and the Houthis not to use child soldiers. Is all that work undone now?We have managed to maintain at least a dialogue on the subject with the Houthis, the popular committees and the armed forces -- about how children can be released, and how we can avoid further recruitment. But we’ve yet to see results. Obviously much of the progress of last year has been lost -- not just on child recruitment but also on the political project towards a more peaceful society. What does the participation of children in Yemen’s war portend for the future of the country?It’s terrible to see children as young as 10 or 11 years old carrying Kalashnikovs. It’s just wrong.It also destroys the education of hundreds, maybe thousands, of children. Instead of being able to contribute to society through their education, getting into business or work for the health services, they won’t have those chances. It will presumably contribute to making Yemen a more violent society, which is deeply regrettable.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Read More WorldPost Yemen Coverage:Also on HuffPost:"
6,THE WORLDPOST,Why You Need To Be Worried About This Week’s Terror Attack In Pakistan,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pakistan-terror-attack_us_56a2b0e3e4b0404eb8f1c1c9,"In the country's long fight against armed extremism, people are beginning to run out of hope.",2016-01-23,"Mourners carry the coffin of one of the 21 Pakistanis killed at Bacha Khan University, Jan. 20, 2016. The incident has weakened hopes for an end to extremism in Pakistan.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a2b6901f00005000216881.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"KARACHI, Pakistan -- In the aftermath of a Wednesday terror attack at a university in the northwest, Pakistan is going through familiar motions: remembering the dead; celebrating heroes, like a professor who tried to fight back against armed intruders; debating what the government and military could have done better.What’s different, Pakistanis say, is that they didn’t think they would be going through this ritual again so soon after the last major tragedy.Just over a year ago, gunmen linked to the Pakistani Taliban killed 150 people, the vast majority of them children, at an army school in Peshawar, the capital of the northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. The university attacked Wednesday is in Charsadda, less than an hour away. In the weeks after the Peshawar attack, Pakistan’s elites pledged to ramp up the fight against terror operatives. The country is home to a range of loosely aligned militant Islamist organizations, including al Qaeda, two main branches of the Taliban that are respectively battling the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Pakistani groups that target India. Eager to use non-state actors to achieve its own regional goals, Pakistan’s security establishment has fostered and protected many of these fighters. Many of the militants have established themselves in Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas, a region not far from the site of the school and university attacks. Many others have sanctuaries in the wealthy central province of Punjab and in the country’s business hub, Karachi.Civilian and military officials have been promising to rein in those militants for years. The army launched its latest operation against those based in FATA in 2014, after a dramatic Pakistani Taliban attack on Karachi’s airport. It said it would redouble its efforts against armed extremists there and around the country following the Peshawar incident.For a year, that narrative held strong. Pakistan’s streets have become festooned with billboards praising the army chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif. Bumper stickers dedicated to Sharif and the army are on cars, walls and gates. And Washington embraced Sharif and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (no relation), with the Obama administration suggesting Pakistan might now not just stabilize itself but also start helping to secure Afghanistan.Wednesday’s attack has the potential to change all that -- and therefore fuel even more instability in this nuclear-armed country of 200 million.It’s left Pakistanis even angrier with an establishment that has spoken one too many times of finally severing ties with violent fundamentalists.“Our military/political leadership is either still looking for 'proof' [that certain actors are guilty], still dividing terrorists as good or bad, [and] refusing to admit that the real curse is the terrorist/extremist ideology that used religion and was cultivated by our own state,” wrote Taimur Bandey, a prominent educationist in Lahore, in a Facebook post Wednesday.In the days that followed, news outlets refocused attention on two controversies about politicians and military officials’ ties to extremists. One involved the government’s reluctance to arrest a politically powerful cleric who justified 2014’s school attack and supports the Islamic State group. The other concerns the army’s relationship with the group held responsible for an attack on an Indian military base earlier this year.The frustration isn’t new. Here’s what is: the growing sense that Pakistan might not be able to effectively resist the militants who have come to call it home.The sense of futility is different than it's been in the past. The last 12 months have seen the military gain vast new powers, including its own system of military courts, and the government approving other ostensible anti-terror tactics, like the death penalty. Now those already controversial moves look pointless. Outside analyses of them doesn’t help. The re-imposition of the death penalty here has inspired international condemnation and claimed hundreds of lives, including that of a man sentenced as a 14-year-old after he confessed to kidnapping while in police custody. A January report by the International Commission of Jurists accused Pakistan's military court system of undermining citizens' rights, sentencing many to death on the basis of shadowy trials.“Military trials in Pakistan are secret, opaque and make a mockery of Pakistan’s domestic and international fair trial obligations,” Sam Zarifi, the group’s Asia Director, said in a statement. “Pakistan faces a genuine threat from militant group... but militarizing the judicial process will not lead to justice and it will not control terrorism. This is the lesson from around the world.” Many Pakistani press reports of Wednesday's terror attack included standard pro-military talking points -- for instance, talking about the army’s ability to rapidly contain the situation once it had begun. At the same time, though, skepticism seems more public than it’s been for months.Bandey called the attack “yet another lesson that by hanging terrorists, by bombing their training centers or by arresting them, the issue of terror or terrorism won't fade away.”“We sadly only know how to cut off the limb instead of tackling the disease or we simply don’t even recognize/ diagnose the disease as a disease,” he wrote.Wednesday was also worrying because it was a reminder that the Pakistani Taliban (a faction of which claimed responsibility for the attack), along with other extremists, are taking direct aim at one potential antidote to that ""disease"" of fundamentalism: secular politics.The university attacked was named for Bacha Khan, an anti-colonial leader critical to the history of the Pashtun people of Pakistan's northwest. Decades before anti-Soviet mujahedeen recruiters or al Qaeda agents were signing up disaffected Pashtuns, Khan was speaking to them of a nonviolent resistance that drew on Islam and local customs, the noted Pakistani author Kamila Shamsie recalled Wednesday.Khan's heirs today are to be found in the Awami National Party, a secular Pashtun-dominated organization. But ANP's clout is diminishing, due to its record of corruption and the deliberate targeting of party leaders by extremists. Like the Islamic State group trying to kill moderate Sunni leaders in Iraq to persuade all Sunnis to rally behind its black flag, armed Pakistani fundamentalists appear determined to convince Pashtuns and others here that siding with the militants is their best bet.Bandey's remarks Wednesday suggest that he and others see little hope for improvement.Pakistanis should not, he warned, be surprised by future attacks. Or even by their targets. An analysis by the widely read English-language DAWN newspaper found that educational institutions are being struck with growing frequency."

8,THE WORLDPOST,Haiti Postpones Presidential Election As Violence Erupts,"Frank Jack Daniel, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/haiti-presidential-elections-postponed_us_56a305f1e4b0404eb8f1c979,The election has already been postponed twice before.,2016-01-23,"Demonstrators burn tires during a protest in Port-au-Prince, on January 22, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a306d32a00002c00031256.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti called off its presidential election on Friday, two days before it was due, over concerns of escalating violence sparked by the opposition candidate's refusal to take part in a process he said was riddled with fraud.Pierre Louis Opont, president of Haiti's electoral council, said the runoff vote was being pushed back for security reasons. But he did not say when the election, already postponed twice before, would be rescheduled.The announcement led to jubilation from demonstrators marching to oppose the election. They danced on the streets of the capital Port-au-Prince, but the mood quickly darkened. Gunshots were fired as protesters clashed with police.The postponement is nevertheless expected to ease unrest after days of protests in the deeply impoverished country of about 10 million people, at pains to rebuild from a devastating earthquake six years ago and to emerge from decades of political dysfunction.Several western nations, fearing a new era of instability in the Caribbean nation, have been assisting Haiti in its election preparations. The U.S. government alone has chipped in $30 million.But opposition candidate Jude Celestin said last week he would not take part in the election, alleging a first round vote in October was rigged to favor the ruling party candidate.""The fact that the electoral council was forced to give up the electoral farce is a victory for the Haitian people,"" said Jean-Charles Moise, another opposition candidate who said fraud led to his first-round defeat.Hamstrung with weak institutions, Haiti has struggled to build a stable democracy since the overthrow of the 1957-1986 dictatorship of the Duvalier family and ensuing military coups and election fraud.GOVERNMENT CONVENES ON SECURITYThe government held an unscheduled cabinet meeting to plan measures to ""guarantee public order and the security of lives and property,"" the prime minister's office said in statement without giving details.In a statement explaining the postponement, the election commission reported that seven election offices and an official's home had been torched and several other offices were attacked, including by armed men.On Friday, thousands marched in the capital for the third time this week. Police fired at a group attacking a man who appeared to have shot at them. The man lay bleeding profusely, but it was unclear how he was injured.Protesters set fire to at least one car. Burning tires billowed black smoke directly below a giant poster of ruling party candidate Jovenel Moise. A man stabbed another poster of Moise with a metal pole.""The direction (outgoing President Michel) Martelly has taken the country is no good,"" said Rolando Joilcoeui, a community worker standing among the crowds.""We've said 'no' to that regime. The election was a fraud.""Swiss-trained engineer Celestin said the government has not remedied cheating in the first round, and called the plans for the second round vote ""a farce.""Celestin was second in a field of 54 candidates in the October election. He came in almost eight percentage points behind Moise, a banana-exporter and political newcomer running on a platform to modernize agriculture and water management in the flood and drought-prone nation.Moise told Reuters earlier on Friday the vote represented ""the will of the people"" even if he was the only candidate fully participating.After the postponement, members of Moise's campaign team sat grim-faced at a city hotel. Asked what happens next, one said: ""That's the million dollar question.""Haiti's newly appointed senators voted almost unanimously to postpone the vote earlier this week, and the Catholic church, business groups and local election observers warned an election under such conditions would not be credible.'CLEAR TIMELINE'In a statement from the United Nations, the ""core group"" of countries aiding Haiti that include Brazil, France and the United States among others, said they deplored the violence and reiterated ""support for the conclusion of an inclusive and equitable electoral process.""U.S. Republican presidential candidate, Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, told Reuters Haitimust lay out ""a clear timeline"" for a democratic election.Only about a quarter of Haiti's 5.8 million registered voters cast their ballots in the first round.Local observers say a loophole meant thousands of booth watchers employed by parties were able to vote more than once.

9,THE WORLDPOST,Haiti Postpones Presidential Election As Violence Erupts,"Frank Jack Daniel, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/haiti-presidential-elections-postponed_us_56a305f1e4b0404eb8f1c979,The election has already been postponed twice before.,2016-01-23,"Demonstrators run during a protest in Port-au-Prince, on January 22, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a307121f000050002168b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti called off its presidential election on Friday, two days before it was due, over concerns of escalating violence sparked by the opposition candidate's refusal to take part in a process he said was riddled with fraud.Pierre Louis Opont, president of Haiti's electoral council, said the runoff vote was being pushed back for security reasons. But he did not say when the election, already postponed twice before, would be rescheduled.The announcement led to jubilation from demonstrators marching to oppose the election. They danced on the streets of the capital Port-au-Prince, but the mood quickly darkened. Gunshots were fired as protesters clashed with police.The postponement is nevertheless expected to ease unrest after days of protests in the deeply impoverished country of about 10 million people, at pains to rebuild from a devastating earthquake six years ago and to emerge from decades of political dysfunction.Several western nations, fearing a new era of instability in the Caribbean nation, have been assisting Haiti in its election preparations. The U.S. government alone has chipped in $30 million.But opposition candidate Jude Celestin said last week he would not take part in the election, alleging a first round vote in October was rigged to favor the ruling party candidate.""The fact that the electoral council was forced to give up the electoral farce is a victory for the Haitian people,"" said Jean-Charles Moise, another opposition candidate who said fraud led to his first-round defeat.Hamstrung with weak institutions, Haiti has struggled to build a stable democracy since the overthrow of the 1957-1986 dictatorship of the Duvalier family and ensuing military coups and election fraud.GOVERNMENT CONVENES ON SECURITYThe government held an unscheduled cabinet meeting to plan measures to ""guarantee public order and the security of lives and property,"" the prime minister's office said in statement without giving details.In a statement explaining the postponement, the election commission reported that seven election offices and an official's home had been torched and several other offices were attacked, including by armed men.On Friday, thousands marched in the capital for the third time this week. Police fired at a group attacking a man who appeared to have shot at them. The man lay bleeding profusely, but it was unclear how he was injured.Protesters set fire to at least one car. Burning tires billowed black smoke directly below a giant poster of ruling party candidate Jovenel Moise. A man stabbed another poster of Moise with a metal pole.""The direction (outgoing President Michel) Martelly has taken the country is no good,"" said Rolando Joilcoeui, a community worker standing among the crowds.""We've said 'no' to that regime. The election was a fraud.""Swiss-trained engineer Celestin said the government has not remedied cheating in the first round, and called the plans for the second round vote ""a farce.""Celestin was second in a field of 54 candidates in the October election. He came in almost eight percentage points behind Moise, a banana-exporter and political newcomer running on a platform to modernize agriculture and water management in the flood and drought-prone nation.Moise told Reuters earlier on Friday the vote represented ""the will of the people"" even if he was the only candidate fully participating.After the postponement, members of Moise's campaign team sat grim-faced at a city hotel. Asked what happens next, one said: ""That's the million dollar question.""Haiti's newly appointed senators voted almost unanimously to postpone the vote earlier this week, and the Catholic church, business groups and local election observers warned an election under such conditions would not be credible.'CLEAR TIMELINE'In a statement from the United Nations, the ""core group"" of countries aiding Haiti that include Brazil, France and the United States among others, said they deplored the violence and reiterated ""support for the conclusion of an inclusive and equitable electoral process.""U.S. Republican presidential candidate, Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, told Reuters Haitimust lay out ""a clear timeline"" for a democratic election.Only about a quarter of Haiti's 5.8 million registered voters cast their ballots in the first round.Local observers say a loophole meant thousands of booth watchers employed by parties were able to vote more than once.

13,POLITICS,Rick Snyder's Misleading Claim About Who Changed Flint's Water,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rick-snyder-flint_us_56a10daae4b076aadcc579b0,The city's leaders didn't start this mess.,2016-01-23,Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) said the Flint City Council set in motion the city's disastrous water crisis. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_16_271_4305_2119%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"At his annual State of the State address on Tuesday, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) accepted blame for the water crisis in Flint and offered an explanation for how it started. ""This crisis began in the spring of 2013, when the Flint City Council voted 7-1 to buy water from the Karegnondi Water Authority,"" he said.It's simpler than that: Snyder's government gave Flint bad water treatment advice, and the city got bad water. And it's also more complicated: City officials did play a role, but Snyder's version of events oversells it.""The governor's been trying to use that line -- that action that was taken by the city council -- to remove himself from this problem,"" former Flint City Council member Josh Freeman told ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast.As for the decision to join the KWA, it was made even before Flint's elected leaders voted -- by the emergency manager Snyder had appointed to run Flint's affairs because the city was broke. The manager had total control over the city's government and the council only got to weigh in because the director of the new water authority insisted.""I said, 'I will not accept that,'"" Karegnondi CEO Jeff Wright recalled in an interview with The Huffington Post. ""I do require a decision of this magnitude to be voted on by the elected representatives of the people.""So on that fateful day, the Flint City Council voted to join the KWA, knowing the new system wouldn't be ready until 2016. The Detroit Water & Sewerage Department had been raising Flint's rates every year, resulting in some of the state's highest water bills. City and state officials believed Flint could save millions of dollars by joining the new system.Then the Detroit system, from which the city had been buying its water for nearly 50 years, notified Flint and the surrounding Genesee County that it would be cutting off their service in the spring of 2014.What could be done between 2014 and 2016, when the KWA came online? Genesee County opted to continue buying water from Detroit, but at a 10 percent higher rate, according to Wright, who is Genesee's drain commissioner in addition to being the CEO of the KWA.Flint wound up going for the Flint River, though it's not clear exactly how the decision was made.""At no time had we decided to use the Flint River... as our primary water source,"" said Freeman, who resigned from the council in December after serving more than 10 years.Dayne Walling, who served as Flint's mayor until Karen Weaver unseated him in November, told the Detroit Free Press that month that emergency manager Edward Kurtz made the decision not long after the KWA vote. Kurtz also signed an order hiring a firm ""for assistance in placing the Flint Water Plant into operation using the Flint River as a primary drinking water source for approximately two years,"" though Kurtz wasn't in charge when the switch happened in 2014. Regardless of whether they had a hand in the decision, however, Flint City Council members said they didn't think using the Flint River was a crazy idea, and they didn't object. The Flint River already served as the city's official backup. It had been used twice in 2009, but not for longer than a week. The Flint Water Treatment Plant pumped water several times each year for the sole purpose of making sure it stayed ready. Monica Galloway, who represents Flint's 7th Ward on the council, was at the plant that day in 2014 when Walling ceremoniously pushed a button to make the change. Galloway thought the Flint River represented an opportunity to lower her constituents' water bills. ""I thought, 'This can be good. We have had such high water bills,'"" Galloway said in an interview. ""It just seems like as a community, for me, man, we got a hold on something we can control.""Nobody expected the water switch to result in lead-poisoned children, undrinkable water, a declaration of a federal emergency and the National Guard assisting with door-to-door delivery of bottled water. The river water wound up leaching lead from the city's aging pipes because the city failed to control for the water's corrosiveness. Here's what went wrong: Instead of telling the city to treat the water, the Michigan Department of Environment Quality told it to just monitor the water for a year, then decide what kind of corrosion treatment it needed, according to an MDEQ memo from November that was included in Snyder's recently released emails relating to the crisis. An Environmental Protection Agency official reported in a leaked June memo that high lead levels were possible in Flint because the city did not have a system for controlling corrosion. After the memo came to light, the EPA said it had been a mere draft; state officials used that assurance to downplay its warnings.""A major concern from a public health standpoint is the absence of corrosion control treatment in the City of Flint for mitigating lead and copper levels in the drinking water,"" the memo said. ""Recent drinking water sample results indicate the presence of high lead results in the drinking water, which is to be expected in a public water system that is not providing corrosion control treatment."" Edwards said his own experiments with adding corrosion inhibitors to Flint water samples reduced the water's ability to leach heavy metals from pipe materials. ""Had they followed the law, the switch would have been considered a success,"" Edwards said. Snyder, for his part, has admitted the state made mistakes and has apologized repeatedly."
14,POLITICS,Justice Breyer Is Dying For A Case That Will Kill The Death Penalty For Good,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/breyer-death-penalty_us_56a20b9be4b076aadcc62793,He's ready.,2016-01-23,Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer wants to hear a real death penalty case soon.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a20c8c1f00007f0021679b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Supreme Court gets last-minute death penalty appeals all the time, even when it's on summer recess. It seldom grants them.It refused two requests late Thursday from Christopher Eugene Brooks, an Alabama inmate who was hoping to convince the justices that his death sentence was unconstitutional. He was executed less than an hour later.One of Brooks' eleventh-hour appeals dealt with Alabama's planned use of midazolam, the same sedative the Supreme Court held was constitutional in an explosive case last year. The court rejected Brooks' petition without comment, presumably for that reason.But the inmate's second request dealt with Alabama's process of putting people to death -- a judicial system in which judges essentially play God. The court also rejected Brooks' petition on that point. But this time, three justices spoke. And all three questioned whether Alabama's system can survive the weight of the Constitution much longer.First up was Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who last week, in Hurst v. Florida, led the court in striking down Florida's judge-centric sentencing scheme. Joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, she declined Brooks' petition due to ""procedural obstacles."" But she suggested that the changed legal landscape since the Hurst decision -- still causing chaos in Florida -- meant Alabama's capital sentencing scheme's days were numbered. The big surprise, though, was Justice Stephen Breyer, the only one who would have spared Brooks' life for a little while so the court could take a closer look at his claim that Alabama's sentencing regime violates the Constitution.""Christopher Eugene Brooks was sentenced to death in accordance with Alabama's procedures, which allow a jury to render an advisory verdict that is not binding on the court,"" wrote Breyer. This system, he added, ""is much like and based on Florida's"" now unconstitutional system.Then came the kicker.""The unfairness inherent in treating this case differently from others which used similarly unconstitutional procedures only underscores the need to reconsider the validity of capital punishment under the Eighth Amendment,"" Breyer wrote.As if to say, ""I'm ready to consider whether the death penalty is unconstitutional once and for all.""That case may be on the horizon. And Breyer is ready for it.Also on HuffPost:"

I know -- those words don't seem like they belong together. But these Maple Sesame Kale Chips really are as addicting as candy. The recipe comes from one of my favorite new cookbooks, Kale, Glorious Kale by Catherine Walthers. The crisp, shattering leaves are a bit salty, a bit sweet and a bit spicy; and the sesame seeds add nutty flavor and heft. The first time I made them, I ate the entire batch standing at the stove before I could even photograph them, and then I happily made them again. They're guilt free, after all. And filling too -- make them in the afternoon and they'll easily tide you over until dinnertime.To make them, begin by pulling the kale leaves off of the tough ribs. Discard the ribs, then thoroughly dry the leaves with paper towels. If the leaves start off wet, they won't crisp up.Next, toss the kale with olive oil, maple syrup, salt, cayenne pepper and sesame seeds (there's a link at the bottom of this post to the recipe with exact measurements).Be sure the leaves are evenly coated.Arrange the kale on a parchment lined baking sheet in a single layer.Then bake for 25-30 minutes, until the kale is crisp but not browned. Keep a close eye towards the end; the chips go from perfectly cooked to burnt quickly.Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary, then let cool on the baking sheet. GET THE RECIPEGET THE RECIPE"

Despite its significance, we are just days away from the ""first in the nation"" Iowa caucuses and the direction of this election is still very much ""up in the air"" and about as confusing as any in recent memory. Iowa, therefore, will be important.On the Republican side, Donald Trump remains atop the field holding a commanding lead. The prospect of a Trump victory is panicking the party's leadership who don't trust his commitment to conservative principles and fear the damage he may do to the party's chances to win the White House and keep control of Congress.The establishment's concerns are compounded by two key factors. They must be careful that in attacking Trump they don't alienate his supporters -- since Republicans will need them to win in November. And there is no logical establishment alternative to Trump. The contenders to that throne have all run rather lack-luster campaigns and have drawn considerable blood attacking each other. A recent poll demonstrates the GOP's problem. In that poll, 20 percent of Republican voters said they will not vote for any candidate in November other than Trump, with another 20 percent saying they will not vote for Trump if he is the party's nominee -- a conundrum, indeed.In fact, at this point, Trump's only real competition is coming from another anti-establishment candidate, Ted Cruz. While the GOP leadership fears Trump, they truly dislike Cruz.Iowa is important. If Trump wins Iowa and goes on to win in New Hampshire, he would be positioned to win the Republican nomination. However, if Cruz, a favorite among Evangelical Christians, wins in Iowa, it could knock Trump off his pedestal creating a very different dynamic for the contests in New Hampshire and beyond. The problems of no clear establishment favorite and what to do about Trump's supporters will remain, but it will be a very different election for the GOP. On the Democratic side, the once inevitable Clinton candidacy has shown signs of fading in the face of a surprisingly strong challenge by Bernie Sanders. Sanders' candidacy has been powered by his authenticity and principled progressive politics. Recent polls show Sanders in a virtual tie with Clinton in Iowa and beating her rather decisively in New Hampshire.Once again, Iowa is important. If Sanders loses Iowa, his insurgent campaign will no doubt continue, but without the same energy. If, however, Sanders wins both Iowa and New Hampshire, it will change the entire dynamic of this contest energizing his supporters while at the same time exposing Clinton's weaknesses as a candidate. It will not, however, be decisive because the Democratic party establishment has many of the same concerns about Sanders as the GOP has about Trump.Another concern shared by many Democrats is that while they want to keep the White House and win control of the Senate, they fear the polarized partisanship that has long paralyzed Washington politics. With either Sanders or Clinton as the party standard-bearer, they are concerned that we will see only more rancorous rhetoric from the GOP and more paralysis. Should Sanders win both Iowa and New Hampshire, two outcomes are possible. One is that, the Clinton-Sanders contest will get more heated and will continue until one emerges bloodied but victorious at the end of a drawn out fight. Another possibility is that Joe Biden may be pressed to reconsider his decision to enter the race. While Biden has, in fact, missed the filing dates to compete in a number of states, there are enough major states (which account for well over one-quarter of all the party's delegates) in which he could still qualify to appear on the ballot -- states Biden may not win outright, but in which he may win enough delegates to insure a ""brokered convention"" that will have to vote on the eventual nominee.In such a scenario, the contest would pit Sanders and Clinton against Biden, with Biden rightly claiming to be both the heir of the Obama coalition and legacy, and the one Democrat who can expand that coalition and work to end the partisan divide. With many Democrats nervous about the ability of Sanders and Clinton to change Washington's poisonous atmosphere, Biden could emerge as an interesting choice. While some Democrats might dread a wide-open convention, such a truly democratic exercise might actually create a very positive dynamic that could help energize the party faithful for the November contest.The bottom line is that we are just days away from the Iowa caucuses and only two things are clear: the stakes are high and the shape of this contest is still uncertain.

It's more detailed than most of the other candidates' economic plans and conveniently stays on your computer in your downloads section, so you don't have to re-access the website to re-read it.Other issues on Kasich's site include education, national security, health care, the second amendment, abortion and welfare. The site successfully persuades readers into believing Kasich can accomplish what's listed on his site by listing his past accomplishments as governor. And while other candidates' sites list more issues than Kasich's few, if any, do a better job of persuading readers into believing he can accomplish what he sets out to as president. Grade: B+Chris ChristieURL: chrischristie.comLinks about issues: 7Christie's slogan of ""Telling It Like It Is"" is sort of depressing, and is displayed in the top left corner of his sites homepage. Then his issues tab hits you with what I took as a brag: ""Governor Christie Has Brought Unprecedented Conservative Reform To One Of The Bluest States In America."" But the first issue shown on the page is one that millennials seem to think is in dire need of addressing -- criminal justice reform.The second issue of social security switches focus to an older generation, and the third, fourth and fifth reunite the audiences by talking about foreign policy, education and the economy. His issues end with immigration and healthcare for veterans. So Christie's site delves into fewer issues than Kasich, but like Kasich's, he uses his past experience and accomplishments as New Jersey governor to convince readers of what he can do as the country's leader. But frankly, his site's persuasion falls short of Kasich's, and his detail does, too. Grade: C+Jeb BushURL: jeb2016.comLinks about issues: 19Whoa, immediately you see the difference in the variety of issues Bush tries to cater towards compared to Christie and Kasich. His first category is titled ""Safer,"" and the first tab underneath it is ""Defeating ISIS."" The detail under this tab is straightforward and convincing, and is one of the most convincing tabs of all the candidates' tabs addressing the terrorist group. And the rest of the tabs follow suit.

20,ARTS,Constance Mallinson's 'Free Painting Experiment' and Its Unexpected Result,"John Seed, ContributorProfessor of Art and Art History, Mt. San Jacinto College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/constance-mallinsons-free_b_9057546.html,"""Raft,"" the centerpiece of the artist's carefully designed ""free painting"" experiment was given away -- not sold -- in an attempt to bypass and raise questions about the usual artist/dealer/collector nexus and its operations.",2016-01-23,2016-01-23-1453516149-4681547-mallinsonportrait2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-01-23-1453516149-4681547-mallinsonportrait2-thumb.jpg,"Constance Mallinson, Raft, 2015, oil on canvas, 48 x 60 inches In a smallish upstairs space at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena, Constance Mallinson's Raft, a hyper-detailed canvas depicting the detritus of consumer culture, was recently on view for two months. At the close of the exhibition, on November 29th, the painting was taken down and handed over to its new owner, who hadn't paid a cent for it. ""Raft,"" the centerpiece of the artist's carefully designed ""free painting"" experiment was given away -- not sold -- in an attempt to bypass and raise questions about the usual artist/dealer/collector nexus and its operations. ""I wanted to display and give away the painting to circumvent the traditional marketing system,"" says Mallinson, a respected veteran of the LA art scene. ""I have certain problems with it, the way that art and money collide in a way that can be injurious to the perception of art-making."" Mallinson's idealistic experiment positioned the work of art as something with no price tag that couldn't simply be purchased: it had to be ""valued"" but not in monetary terms. Any and all interested parties were asked to fill out an online form and be interviewed by Mallinson. The interviews were videotaped and then handed over to a panel who would decide the painting's fate. Sinéad Finnerty-Pyne, the supervising curator, was impressed from the start by Mallinson's ideas and intentions: ""It took a lot of courage and she (Mallinson) really put herself on the line. It was an open-ended process.""   Constance Mallinson""I wanted to challenge the modus operandi of art collectors, which usually consists of just showing up with their check books,"" Mallinson philosophizes. ""In my experience, the collecting process has always been so anonymous. There is never any contact, never an invitation to talk to collectors about the work. There has always been this opacity. With those problems in mind my project was designed to do a lot. I wanted to incite a lot of looking and talking and find out how people responded to my work independently from the usual gallery BS.""Malinson, a flexible and subversive thinker, knew that the imagery of ""Raft"" would in itself be provocative, hopefully in a good way. A dense accretion of castoff items -- Mallinson thinks of the imagery of the painting as verging on ""apocalyptic"" -- it is a visual record of the ""mind-boggling"" stuff she finds on her Rauschenbergian daily walks: lost toys, dead birds, Christmas ornaments, fast food wrappers, dog toys and more. ""There is a fairly strong message in this painting,"" Mallinson comments. It doesn't take too much of a deep reading to realize that ""Raft"" is about the fine line between beauty and trash and about our tendency to purchase and discard. Those dynamics apply not only to the consumer goods we all rely on, but perhaps to art and art collecting as well. Alternatively, Mallinson offered her painting as something to be contemplated and cherished. One of the perceptions embodied in Mallinson's experiment is that contemporary works of art, made for a hungry art market rife with speculation, have themselves begun to seem a bit more ""disposable."" At the beginning of the process, a variety of interested parties spoke to Mallinson including a teacher from an inner city magnet school for the arts who wanted the painting to hang in her classroom to inspire students. There was also a renowned breast cancer surgeon and researcher who wanted to either sell the painting to raise funds or hang it in an area where patients could look at it. Add to that: four artists, an architect and a collector. One of the artists had the intention of lending the painting out to anyone who wanted it for a period. Rather than just being obliged to open their checkbooks, the applicants were asked questions that rarely gets asked of prospective art collectors, including two doozies: ""Why do you want this work of art?"" and ""Are you prepared to properly care for and preserve this painting?""All of the conversations were video-taped, and then handed over to the panel. The panel, made up of six carefully chosen art world professionals -- a critic, two art historians, a gallerist, a curator and two artists -- then deliberated after watching the taped conversations. As the panel consulted, some themes emerged: the painting wasn't really ""right"" for a lot of people. In many cases it was clear that the painting might not be properly preserved or cared for. Art historian Colin Gardner, one of the panelists, observed that the project was a kind of ""Trojan Horse"" that delivered its message stealthily. One panelist offered that the painting should be returned to Mallinson for her to bestow, but that would have been contrary to the artist's original intentions. After over two hours of discussion and much back-and-forth the painting was ultimately awarded to...Matthew Scheele: a young collector.  Constance Mallinson interviews Matthew Scheele about his interest in ""Raft""A private chef of moderate means and Scheele won the panel over with his sincerity and his genuine interest in the painting. ""The result blew my mind,"" says Mallinson, ""but the panel found him so sensitive and smart, and they felt in the long run that he had responded to them with winning simplicity and honesty."" In a surprising way, the choice of a collector as the recipient of the painting re-affirmed the traditional notion that paintings should be cared for by people who really love them. It was, in the end, an unexpected but wonderful result.""It was fascinating,"" Mallinson reflects. ""It ended up renewing my belief in the power of painting. The panelist seemed to feel that Matthew had the proper attitude and that he would take care of it, as collectors have throughout history. As one panelist reminded me, the reason we have museums full of gorgeous paintings is that collectors recognized and valued the uniqueness and beauty of the art objects and took care to preserve them through wars and such. So perhaps if the painting had gone to a venue where it could have been damaged or stolen or not properly valued as a special object, it would have gone against the grain of this wonderful history of taking care of art for the future. Painting survives because of that aspect.""From Scheele's point of view, his involvement in the project was an experience that deepened his experience of Mallinson's work and also heightened his sense of responsibility towards it:""On viewing the work I was immediately struck by the scale of 'Raft' and the time and effort it must have taken to create it and while the technical excellence of the painting immediately appealed to me, initially the subject matter did not. However, the nature of the project forced me to consider the work more closely. It was no longer a work of art that I could accept of dismiss casually because I had to consider it as potentially being part of my collection. This need for a deeper consideration of 'Raft' was, for me, the power of the project. I had to stop, look, and think and because of the challenging nature of the subject, think deeply. In my subsequent interview with Constance she referred to the work's title as, 'a portal into the painting', for me that is how the whole project functioned.""Scheele, who had initially been a bit put off by Mallinson's painting had grappled with it as a part of the process and had been won over. This ultimately raised some interesting questions for Mallinson: ""If an investor is just buying/speculating does that discomfort ever get expressed? Is that doubt and unease really an important part of contemporary art?"" Ultimately, the ""Free Painting Experiment"" is just a beginning: Mallinson now envisions an annual ""Free Painting Project"" in which other artists could participate and play roles in deciding where there works would go. She imagines a very different kind of exchange system involving art, perhaps a ""sharing economy."" However it plays out she has a new optimism about the potential for a system that is satisfying both to artists and to the recipients of their works. If she can make that happen -- as it did in her first experiment -- Mallinson is confident that art can ""really do the work it is meant to do in a culture.""Constance Mallinson: Free Painting from Armory Center for the Arts on Vimeo."

For environmentalist like us, it's a critical issue, too.As the world's population grows and as our planet increasingly urbanizes, we need to redefine the relationship between cities and nature. It is no longer enough for us to ""protect the last great places,"" as we used to say at our organization, the Nature Conservancy. Don't get us wrong -- nature needs TNC and the other great environmental organizations to continue championing protection of the lands and water on which all life depends. But if we are going to have a broader impact and if our work is to be relevant in the future, we need to expand our environmental mission to include work in cities. We need to unleash the power of nature to help make cities more resilient, livable and ultimately flourishing so both nature and people can thrive. We now need to work closely in partnership with the people and organizations who have been focusing on cities for a long time.  Since our founding more than 60 years ago, TNC has built a strong track record of helping solve major environmental challenges. We have developed world-leading expertise in science-based outcomes, worked hard on inclusive policy work and have often acted as reliable conveners in multi-stakeholder approaches. We have always worked hard to collaborate with others. We can now bring these same skills to our work with cities.  Nature can help cities solve some major environmental, social and financial challenges. Nature-based solutions can play a major role in providing clean drinking water and cleaner air, and they can help lower pollution impacts from cities. And, perhaps even more importantly, our work in cities can help connect new, younger and more diverse people with nature to ensure the next generation of environmental stewards and supporters.  Take our work to provide clean water, for example. We are working with more than 40 cities around the world on water funds -- using a small levy on urban water consumption to help preserve the pristine area above a city, thereby ensuring clean, cost-effective drinking water for city residents. It's a great win-win: Clean nature assures clean drinking water. TNC's urban water blueprint report has identified cities around the world where this approach could work especially well, affecting more than 700 million people.   What about the impact of water once it leaves a city? Stormwater -- rain that falls on paved areas, flows into overtaxed sewers and then carries all the pollutants directly into rivers and oceans -- is now the biggest form of water-related pollution coming from cities. Two trillion gallons of untreated water per year flow out of cities in the U.S. alone. Several TNC pilot projects in cities such as Washington, D.C., Detroit and Bridgeport, Conn., show that deploying natural -- or green -- infrastructure can dramatically reduce the speed and pollution content of stormwater at much more cost-effective levels than traditional manmade -- or gray -- infrastructure like sewers. Green infrastructure's potential is enormous here -- not to mention the benefits for biodiversity in an urban context.  Nature can also help clean dirty city air. TNC is working in several cities to examine nature's role in removing pollutants from the air. In Louisville, we are working with several partners, including the city and the University of Louisville Medical School, to demonstrate the beneficial role of trees and vegetation on asthma and cardiovascular health.This first and largest study of its kind will help us understand which kind of trees, deployed in the right context, can strategically improve air quality. The outcomes of this and other studies will no doubt help redefine planting trees and vegetation as a major strategy to combat poor city air.  We are exploring the health and well-being power of nature even further. TNC is working with schools, hospitals and offices to prove the power nature can have on cognitive learning, hospitalization time and increased well-being, productivity and engagement in the workplace. These impacts can be dramatic, and they're increasingly drawing the attention of researchers. Which school administration, hospital director or corporate CEO wouldn't want to explore this? Additionally, as many biophilia studies have shown, people who experience the positive impacts of indoor nature become more engaged with and care more about nature in general.  One last, important strategy: The more projects we do in and around cities, the more we can expose urban dwellers -- many of whom are young -- to nature. Author Richard Louv said we don't just need to preserve nature -- we need to create more of it, particularly in cities, so people can benefit from its healing powers.And for TNC, it is crucial we engage and enthuse the next generation of nature supporters to ensure that our mission is relevant 60 years from now.  The time is right to unleash the power of nature in cities.Image: Central Park in Louisville, Kentucky. © Devan King"
22,POLITICS,Sanders and the Theory of Change: Radical Politics for Grown-Ups,"Jedediah Purdy, ContributorProfessor, Duke Law School; Author, 'A Tolerable Anarchy'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sanders-and-the-theory-of_b_9057570.html,"In the stronger, older tradition of campaigns based on ideas and programs rather than personalities, candidates run to build power, and use idealistic language to explain why that power matters.  Then, if they get to govern, they use it.",2016-01-23,"BIRMINGHAM, AL - JANUARY 18: Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks at Boutwell Auditorium, January 18, 2016 in Birmingham, Alabama. Sanders spoke to a capacity crowd of around 5,000 supporters. (Photo by Hal Yeager/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb92e3a3c000020010e1226.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Paul Krugman has joined the self-appointed political grownups closing ranks around Hillary Clinton against Bernie Sanders. In a piece titled ""How Change Happens,"" the liberal economist and New York Times columnist insists, ""The question Sanders supporters should ask is, When has their theory of change ever worked?""That must be right. It's an excellent, sober, adult question. The answer, of course, depends what you think the Sanders campaign's theory of change is. Krugman argues, ""On the left there is always a contingent of idealistic voters eager to believe that a sufficiently high-minded leader can conjure up the better angels of America's nature and persuade the broad public to support a radical overhaul of our institutions."" This, he says, was what drove the Obama campaign in 2008. By implication, he seems to mean other quixotic campaigns, such as George McGovern's in 1972, when McGovern lost forty-nine states to Richard Nixon.Krugman compares unrealistic, high-minded idealism with ""politically pragmatic"" governance, like Franklin Roosevelt's during the New Deal. Roosevelt, he reminds us, cut deals with Southern segregationists and introduced programs like Social Security incrementally. Krugman argues that this dirty-hands commitment to halfway measures, not purity, is what it takes to get things done. Versions of this contrast have become a common refrain: Sanders sounds great, but governing, is messy, complicated, grown-up. Krugman's mistake is very basic. He's wrong about the Sanders campaign's theory of change. It isn't that a high-minded leader can draw out our best selves and translate those into more humane and egalitarian lawmaking. It is that a campaign for a more equal and secure economy and a stronger democracy can build power, in networks of activists and alliances across constituencies. The movement that the campaign helps to create can develop and give voice to a program that the same people will keep working for, in and out of election cycles. In other words, this is a campaign about political ideas and programs that happens to have a person named Bernie at its head, not a campaign that mistakes its candidate for a prophet or a wizard (or the second coming of Abraham Lincoln, who gave us the now-cliché phrase about better angels, but had no delusion that words could substitute for power). The campaign whose loyalists made this idealistic mistake was, of course, Obama's 2008 run. The candidate spoke so charismatically, and seemed so much to embody a vision of realigned, common-sense, fresh-feeling progressivism, that some of us did imagine he could recast American political loyalties. Back then, Krugman was accusing Obama's supporters of spewing ""bitterness"" and ""venom"" and coming ""dangerously close to a cult of personality."" Now he's pleased that President Obama, unlike Candidate Obama, has governed rather like a Clinton: pragmatically, with the hand he was dealt. He seems to think that supporting Sanders's ""purist"" positions means ""prefer[ing] happy dreams to hard thinking about means and ends."" And so, he wants us to think, if we are going to be political grownups, we had better put away childish things. Like talk of truly universal health care (his only example of Sanders's alleged extremism) or, probably, the term ""socialism,"" whose revival is baffling pundits everywhere.Adulthood is charismatic and daunting. It always seems to have the drop on you. But sometimes it just doesn't understand.Yes, F.D.R. governed ""pragmatically,"" in the sense that he counted votes and cut deals. Everyone does this, with the occasional exception of Daenyras, Mother of Dragons. But what made it possible for him to pass sweeping changes in economic regulation and social support, changes so radical that his enemies accused of socialism, of being un-American, of destroying the country and becoming an American Mussolini? The answer is in two parts: ideas and power. His administration stood at the confluence of two great movements. The first was the labor unions, which had been building power, often in bloody and terrible struggles, since the late nineteenth century. The second was made up of the Progressives, generations of reformers who worked in state, cities, and universities -- and occasionally in national government - to achieve economic security and update political democracy in an industrial economy that had transformed the country in the decades after the Civil War. Ideas, programs, and power swirled around Roosevelt, gave his agenda shape, and pressed it forward. These movements were sources of ideas, and also of power. Why did all those enemies and reluctant allies end up meeting Roosevelt halfway? The answer was not not his pragmatic attitude. The reason that even some who hated him had to compromise with Roosevelt or give way was the political force he could marshal. His theory of change was no more about compromise than it was about high-minded words: It was about power. Compromise was a side-effect, a tactic at most.But the central place of power does not mean idealism had no place in the New Deal. Roosevelt explained what he was doing, and why, in language that was more Sanders than Clinton, more vision than wonkery. He famously called for a Second Bill of Rights, an economic program of security, good work, and material dignity. Going back to the Founders to ground the welfare state is, let's say, idealistic. And, while F.D.R. was willing to compromise, he was also willing to draw hard lines, calling out ""economic royalists"" and saying of his enemies, ""They are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred.""Wow. You might hear that from Ted Cruz or possibly Donald Trump this year, but not from any of the Democrats. Roosevelt used the highest idealistic language and the toughest words of conflict. They conveyed the vision behind his program and forced other politicians to form battle lines on the landscape he defined. Then, and only then, he compromised, on his terms.The banal response to Krugman would be that most politicians campaign in poetry and govern in prose -- with the exception of some recent Democrats, notably Hillary, who ease his admirably wonkish heart by never leaving prose mode. Don't fear the poetry! one might say: it is not a theory of change, just a normal way of talking in a democracy.But the real answer is deeper. Obama ran in poetry and has governed in prose, in quite a literal sense that one could diagram in the sentences of his speeches and press conferences. But in the stronger, older tradition of campaigns based on ideas and programs rather than personalities, candidates run to build power, and use idealistic language to explain why that power matters. Then, if they get to govern, they use it.That is a theory of change. To answer Krugman's question: yes, it has worked. In fact, it may be the only theory of change that has ever made democracy real. It is politics for adults."
23,WORLDPOST,Haiti Faces More Election Chaos,"Georgianne Nienaber, ContributorWriter and author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/haiti-faces-more-election_b_9058976.html,"Now, Jude Celestin is once again in the race and has forced the hand of international agents by refusing to participate in what is widely regarded as another fraudulent election process.",2016-01-23,"Protesters march in Port-au-Prince on January 24, 2016 to demand the resignation of Haitian President, Michel Martelly. Haiti's electoral authority postponed Sunday's planned presidential run-off amid mounting opposition street protests and voting fraud allegations. The second round of presidential elections was scheduled for January 24 between ruling party candidate Jovenel Moise and Jude Celestin but was suspended by CEP. Haiti now awaits a new calendar for the second round of presidential elections and legislatives elections. / AFP / HECTOR RETAMAL (Photo credit should read HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc16b352400005000250672.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was inevitable, but not necessary, that it would eventually come to this. Haiti's scheduled January 24 Presidential election has been postponed. The Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) made the announcement on Friday as violence escalated over charges of fraud made by opposition candidate Jude Celestin. Celestin was facing Michel (Sweet Mickey) Martelly's hand picked successor, colorfully and derisively named the ""Banana Man,"" Jovenel Moïse. What comes next is anyone's guess, but a provisional government looms on the horizon. It seems all the chickens have come home to roost after U.S. meddling and vote changing in the previous 2010 Presidential election, which installed Martelly under the watchful eyes of then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her ""aide-de-camp,"" Cheryl Mills. The vote fixing and fraud in that fateful Presidential election, held in the death grip of the 2010 earthquake, has been extensively chronicled in many sources. The most gripping and astounding resides in former OAS Ambassador Ricardo Seitenfus' account, which offers first-hand testimony in his book, International Crossroads and Failures in Haiti. The Brazilian professor details international collusion in Haiti's 2010 elections and discussions by a ""core group,"" including Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and MINUSTAH chief Edmond Mulet, along with then U.S Ambassador Kenneth Merten, of a coup to force President René Préval from office. Ballot box tinkering guaranteed candidate Jude Celestin would not advance to the runoff election. Martelly won the March 2011 runoff with less than 17 percent of eligible voters participating, defeating conservative former first lady Mirlande Manigat.Now, Jude Celestin is once again in the race and has forced the hand of international agents by refusing to participate in what is widely regarded as another fraudulent election process. Two years ago, Celestin's opponent, ""Nèg Bannann"" Moïse, dispossessed as many as 800 peasants and destroyed houses and crops in the Trou-du-Nord zone. What remains is a private banana plantation owned by Moïse's company, Agritrans. It cannot be stressed enough that Moïse is the hand picked candidate of Martelly's ""Bald Party.""The firm stand of the man who refuses to run, Celestin, has encouraged civil society, including business and church leaders, to conclude a vote postponement is in the best interests of Haiti. The Senate also supported a non-binding motion to postpone. In a passionate speech to the nation this week, Celestin said ""...whatever the person who will participate in this January 24, is a traitor to the Nation...When I would be President, I would be legally, constitutionally, with the Haitian people, I refuse to participate in this masquerade that has only one goal, swallow snakes to the entire Haitian population (sic), stop taking us for idiots.""It ironically fell to Pierre-Louis Opont, the president of Haiti's CEP, to make the cancellation announcement for this election. Opont conveniently waited almost five years to cry foul -- until the release of the Hilary Clinton emails left little doubt that votes were either switched or manipulated to advance Martelly in 2010. Last July Opont accused the OAS, the United States, and specifically Cheryl Mills, the Chief of State for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the fraud. Opont says he gave the official vote count to the group of OAS international observers and the group then gave results different than what were passed to them. In a collusion of history and personality, Celestin's defiance in the face of international pressure to participate in what he considers another rigged election has resulted in this standoff. If the elections do not go forward, a provisional government might be the only option.Will the United States and the ""core group"" try to use MINUSTAH to enforce its agenda? Haiti has a long history of provisional governments gone terribly wrong. A recent problematic example can be viewed as prophecy and a warning about U.S. and other foreign involvement.In 1956 Haiti's President Paul E. Magloire, a veteran of the ruling junta of the Revolution of 1946, disputed the termination date of his stay in office. Riots ensued, martial law followed and resulted in a general shut down of Port-au-Prince. Magloire fled to Jamaica, leaving the army in charge. The following period resulted in three provisional presidents. One resigned and the army deposed the others. François (Papa Doc) Duvalier, an administrator of U.S. aid, eventually emerged as the military favorite. Haitians will remember Duvalier's reign and organization of the dreaded Tontons Macoutes; a private force responsible for terrorizing and assassinating alleged foes of the regime. Touton Macoutes translates, roughly, to ""bogeymen."" The tales of provisional governments are cautionary ones and history's parallels can offer valuable instruction as well.President Michel Martelly is required to leave office on February 7 under the Haiti constitution. The question is will he, or will he flee the country like Magloire and others before him, taking whatever riches he can haul in a suitcase?The Miami Herald reported Opont and the CEP ""could not guarantee either the security of poll workers or the country's 5.8 million registered voters in runoffs for six senators, 27 deputies and a President."" 8 Haitian national observation organizations out of 10 refuse to observe the elections of this Sunday while Prime Minister Paul Evans maintained that ""Electoral observation is a citizen approach, it can not be political."" I was in Haiti in early December and the pyres of protest were built, but as yet unlit. The leaders of Haiti's 18th century slave rebellion are forever memorialized in stone within walking distance of the streets where protests began to simmer this October. General. Jean-Jacques Dessalines towers over Champ de Mars, where six years ago, thousands of tents and hundreds of thousands of earthquake survivors huddled in misery. Dessaline's arm is raised in victory as he sits astride his noble Iberian stallion with its flowing long mane and muscles tensed and battle-ready. Henri Christophe and Toussaint Louverture, the latter with his arm resting on a drawn sword, join Dessalines as symbolic survivors of earthquake of 2010 that threatened to catapult the poorest nation in the western hemisphere into inescapable catastrophe. Another stone survivor is nearby. Neg Mawon, often translated in English as the ""Unknown Slave,"" despite the shackles around his ankle, defiantly blows a conch shell, summoning all to battle.Let's hope that another battle does not come to pass with more hand ringing from the international community."

And barring any damage from the storm, some animals are in for quite the frosty treat.""For animals that thrive in the snow, they're going to have a field day,"" Kevin Murphy, general curator of the Philadelphia Zoo, told The Huffington Post.The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., echoed that outlook on its website, saying that ""just like humans, some animals seem to revel in cold weather and snowfall.""Although animals such as polar bears and pandas are used to snowy conditions in the wild, the ones that reside in zoos become accustomed to the local climate. Polar bears can even lead a healthy life in a Mediterranean climate, as they do in the San Diego Zoo. But snow storms like Jonas give these majestic animals a chance to indulge their natural snow-loving ways. Murphy called the nearing snow storm, the first of the year, a potentially ""enriching experience"" for the Philadelphia Zoo's polar bear and red pandas.Many zoos are still preparing for the worst. Snowmageddon '15 wreaked havoc across the northeast, with wind gusts up to 60 mph and up to 20 inches of snow seen in some areas. That storm was estimated to cost the economy over $1 billion, a small fraction of the $15 billion in damage from 2014's polar vortex.This year, many zoos aren't taking any chances.""We're preparing for the possibility of [staff] staying overnight,"" Murphy said. ""We have a skeletal crew ready to be here 24/7 if we need to.""The Philadelphia Zoo narrowly avoided disaster last year when a mass heating failure occurred during a storm. Fortunately, the zoo was able to call in one of its full-time heating mechanics to set up a giant generator. Most of the animals ""never even noticed,"" Murphy said.The National Zoo is also preparing for the sudden drop in temperature.Since many of the animals' habitats are either winterized or indoors, the most difficult task would not be keeping the animals safe but removing the snow, Murphy said.Maryland Zoo General Curator Mike McClure similarly felt that the animal residents will weather the storm just fine. His biggest concern is the zoo's staff, he said. ""They endure the hardship just to make sure the animals are cared for and their lives are uninterrupted."" The Maryland Zoo has doubled up on food, medications for animal treatments, bedding and other necessary supplies and has enlisted nearly 30 staff to monitor and maintain the zoo throughout the weekend as they ""ride out the storm.""""We have to be really diligent to monitor each other,"" McClure added.

And barring any damage from the storm, some animals are in for quite the frosty treat.""For animals that thrive in the snow, they're going to have a field day,"" Kevin Murphy, general curator of the Philadelphia Zoo, told The Huffington Post.The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., echoed that outlook on its website, saying that ""just like humans, some animals seem to revel in cold weather and snowfall.""Although animals such as polar bears and pandas are used to snowy conditions in the wild, the ones that reside in zoos become accustomed to the local climate. Polar bears can even lead a healthy life in a Mediterranean climate, as they do in the San Diego Zoo. But snow storms like Jonas give these majestic animals a chance to indulge their natural snow-loving ways. Murphy called the nearing snow storm, the first of the year, a potentially ""enriching experience"" for the Philadelphia Zoo's polar bear and red pandas.Many zoos are still preparing for the worst. Snowmageddon '15 wreaked havoc across the northeast, with wind gusts up to 60 mph and up to 20 inches of snow seen in some areas. That storm was estimated to cost the economy over $1 billion, a small fraction of the $15 billion in damage from 2014's polar vortex.This year, many zoos aren't taking any chances.""We're preparing for the possibility of [staff] staying overnight,"" Murphy said. ""We have a skeletal crew ready to be here 24/7 if we need to.""The Philadelphia Zoo narrowly avoided disaster last year when a mass heating failure occurred during a storm. Fortunately, the zoo was able to call in one of its full-time heating mechanics to set up a giant generator. Most of the animals ""never even noticed,"" Murphy said.The National Zoo is also preparing for the sudden drop in temperature.Since many of the animals' habitats are either winterized or indoors, the most difficult task would not be keeping the animals safe but removing the snow, Murphy said.Maryland Zoo General Curator Mike McClure similarly felt that the animal residents will weather the storm just fine. His biggest concern is the zoo's staff, he said. ""They endure the hardship just to make sure the animals are cared for and their lives are uninterrupted."" The Maryland Zoo has doubled up on food, medications for animal treatments, bedding and other necessary supplies and has enlisted nearly 30 staff to monitor and maintain the zoo throughout the weekend as they ""ride out the storm.""""We have to be really diligent to monitor each other,"" McClure added. ""Keeping everyone dry and warm is a big concern for us.""All Maryland Zoo animals will be kept indoors during the height of the storm. But once the storm passes and staff can confirm all facilities are intact, McClure said animals that are ""well-suited"" for this type of weather will be permitted to frolic in the snow.""She'll definitely have a good time,"" McClure said about the zoo's only polar bear.The National Zoo is closed for the weekend but will likely resume normal business hours come Monday:Murphy expects the Philadelphia Zoo to stay open as usual on Friday but acknowledges that Saturday's schedule is still up in the frigid air.And while he recognizes that the potential blizzard could provide a challenge for some, Murphy admits he's ""actually excited for it.""If you're excited, too, but can't get to a zoo, catch a glimpse of the National Zoo's giant pandas enjoying their first snow day of the year on the zoo's live webcam.

31,POLITICS,Dear Armed Protesters: Your Little Occupation Is Very Expensive,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oregon-occupation-cost_us_56a292b8e4b0404eb8f1990a,"The takeover is costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars, the Oregon governor says.",2016-01-22,"Ammon Bundy, left, approaches an FBI gate at the Burns Municipal Airport in Oregon on Friday, Jan. 22, 2016. Bundy is the leader of an armed group occupying a national wildlife refuge to protest federal land policies. The stunt hasn't come cheap.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) this week urged federal authorities to do something about the armed protesters wreaking havoc in the state's rural community of Harney County. The militants are costing the state about $100,000 per week, she said, a staggering sum given the occupation's small size. That cost doesn't include salaries paid to federal employees who can't work, or the fence protesters ripped apart with a stolen government excavator. Militants took over the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which is about 30 miles from the town of Burns, on Jan. 2. The group includes the sons of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, and they're a small, ragtag operation. During the first week, only a handful of non-reporters could be seen wandering the refuge grounds at any one time. Later, a horse named Hellboy showed up. Occupiers have quit their jobs and lost their children, and they collect food donations, including soup and jerky. They are protesting the imprisonment of two local ranchers, as well as land stewardship by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Some locals share their concerns, but the community has taken issue with the militants' tactics and repeatedly asked them to go home. The occupiers have refused, and the community is now stuck with a staggering bill. Multiple law enforcement entities are helping the local sheriff keep the peace. (Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward said that deputies have been followed home, and someone flattened a tire on his wife's car.) The $100,000 per week represents the costs of labor, including overtime, travel reimbursement, lodging and meals for those personnel, said Kristen Grainger, a spokeswoman for Gov. Brown. ""This approach is not sustainable,"" she added.Earlier this month, Harney County Judge Steven Grasty broke down the costs in more detail. He said that during the first week of the occupation, school closures due to safety concerns cost the community over $35,000 per day. He added that at least 13 officers were working overtime, and money also went to setting up a command center for federal and local law enforcement. ""My fear is we've got a good community with good people, and we've got crazies who have come in here and they're undoing us,"" Grasty said. The Bureau of Land Management office in Burns, which covers about 120 permanent and temporary employees, closed over safety concerns when the occupation started. From then until Jan. 8, the government spent $125,000 in administrative leave costs, because employees were unable to work or were teleworking. The office remains closed, and those costs have continued to rise, a BLM spokesperson said.The occupation has likely racked up other costs as well. The protesters have vowed not to disturb the refuge, but they have nonetheless destroyed part of a fence, pawed through artifacts belonging to the Paiute tribe and been accused of using government vehicles. Someone has to pay for all this stuff. Cliven Bundy already owes more than $1 million in unpaid grazing fees. His son, Ammon Bundy, has started talking to federal authorities, but it's not yet clear what charges he and the other protesters may face. Federal law makes it a felony, with a sentence of up to 10 years, for anyone who ""converts to his use"" government property worth over $1,000 without authorization. Individuals convicted of crimes also generally pay restitution to victims. Ammon Bundy did not immediately return a Facebook message seeking comment on the price of the occupation.The Bureau of Land Management is keeping its legal options open, a spokesperson said. Brown is seeking an appropriation during the February 2016 legislative session, and will pursue strategies for federal reimbursement of the state's expenses. Earlier this month, Grasty said that he planned to send the occupiers a personal invoice. The bill would be symbolic, but he hoped it would raise awareness. ""The world is going to know what this cost,"" he said. "

""Flint's children were hit the hardest and some have experienced permanent and potentially devastating health defects from lead poisoning.”Experts say children and unborn babies exposed to lead contamination are likely to suffer from a potential list of long-term health and behavioral issues.“We know the needs of Flint children exposed to lead, particularly those most vulnerable -- children ages 0-6 -- are ongoing and long-term,” he added on the site. “You can be assured that your gift will be used for critical interventions today and well into the future.”According to the campaign’s site, every $10 donated will enter participants for a chance to meet Big Sean on his forthcoming U.S. fall tour. All funds raised will go towards the ""Flint Child Health & Development Fund."" So far, Big Sean has donated $10,000 through his “Sean Anderson Foundation"" and raised $6,000.Sean's efforts are his latest gesture to help Michigan's youth. In 2015, he unveiled a recording studio at Detroit's Cass Technical High School and hosted his foundation's first annual scholarship fundraiser event for low income students in Detroit.For more information on Big Sean’s #HealFlintKids campaign head here.Also on HuffPost:"

Comeback is on, and that the media should get in on the ground floor of this amazing narrative. Can an infusion of blue blood help? Let's find out. Here's how the comeback is going.As former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush mounts his amazing comeback run for the Republican nomination, neutral observers may be given cause to wonder, ""Isn't this an odd turn of events for a member of a famously gifted political family?"" Indeed, one of the stranger things about this political season is watching brother Jeb -- the ""smart"" one -- follow the path his cocksure older bro took to primary victory and struggle to get anywhere near the same results. Maybe the next thing you wonder is, ""What is it like to witness this as one of Jeb's family members?"" Well, we have some developments on that front. Jeb has apparently managed to score the all-but-certainly game-changing endorsement of his own mother. It took a while, but she's finally convinced.More or less, I mean. There's a bit of equivocation near the end!BARBARA BUSH: Jeb has been a very good father, a wonderful son, a hard worker. His heart is big. When push comes to shove, people are going to realize Jeb has real solutions. Rather than talking about how popular they are, how great they are. He's doing it because he sees a huge need and it's not being filled by anybody. Of all the people running, he seems to be the one who could solve the problems. I think he'll be a great president.MSNBC's Chris Hayes put it best:This endorsement could be a bit more ringing, but hopefully it will prove to be the tide-turner that, you know, finally convinces Jeb's dad to get off the fence.This has been the Jeb! Comeback Watch for Jan. 22, 2016. Jeb Bush is currently in fifth place in Iowa (4.6 percent), sixth place in New Hampshire (8.2 percent) and fifth place nationally (5.7 percent)."
