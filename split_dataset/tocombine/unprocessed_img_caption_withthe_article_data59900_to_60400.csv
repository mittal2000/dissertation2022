""In the past, there's been fireworks but not on this scale.""Kerala is studded with temples managed by rich and powerful trusts that often flout local regulations.

""My thoughts are with families of the deceased and prayers with the injured.""Modi has faced public criticism in the past for failing to respond quickly to disasters such as the floods in Chennai late last year. Large parts of the metropolis were under water for days before government help arrived.Earlier this month, a flyover under construction in the eastern city of Kolkata for years collapsed killing 27 people, prompting allegations that shoddy material was used and that the metal parts had corroded during the years of delay.Television images from the devastated temple site showed people, some clutching children with burn injuries, being taken to hospitals. Others carried out charred bodies of victims.Kerala's Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala told Reuters that 60 of the 100 dead had been identified while the number of people admitted to hospitals in Kollam and the state capital had risen to 383.NO PERMISSIONWith Kerala in the midst of an election for a new state assembly, the temple fire quickly turned into a political issue as local leaders demanded an investigation into the fireworks display.In Kerala, Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party trails its rivals the Congress party and the communists. The BJP has focused on building up grassroots strength in the state for decades.Chief Minister Chandy said the Kollam district administration had denied the temple authorities permission to carry out the fireworks display, and that the government will investigate how they went ahead.""There was no permission to even store the fireworks,"" he said.Police has registered a case against the temple authorities for negligence. The temple trust was not immediately available for comment.Kerala is studded with temples, managed by rich and powerful trusts that often flout local regulations. Each year temples carry out fireworks displays, often competing to stage the most spectacular ones. There are judges who decide the winners.Kollam district magistrate A. Shainamol said people living in the neighborhood of the temple had complained about the danger of these fireworks in the past.The explosion from the fireworks was so strong that some parts of the temple roof caved in. Local media showed bulldozers trying to clear the area of the debris.The Puttingal temple is one of the oldest in the state. It was built on the site of an ant hill where locals believe a goddess appeared centuries ago."

They were taken from their mother too early and are being bottle-fed for the time being, a rescue center employee told The Huffington Post on Sunday. Fortunately, the kittens are expected to make a full recovery and should be available for adoption within a month.The rescue center initially told The Huffington Post that the kittens had been recovered inside a trash bag, but later said that this was not correct. A representative for the Solid Waste Authority told HuffPost on Thursday the kittens were found on a pile of yard debris.Since the kittens have gone from trash to treasure, they've been named after gemstones. The three male kittens are named Garnet, Jet and Topaz, and the female kitten is named Ruby. A Facebook user provided the adorable names.On Friday, the rescue group shared photos of the kittens on its social media page. One of the photos shows three men cradling the kittens in their hands while wearing Solid Waste Authority uniforms.Facebook users quickly hailed the men as heroes in the photo's comment section. One user also dubbed them the ""Sexiest dudes EVER!""No arguments here.This story was updated with additional information about where the kittens were found.

Many people are inundated with great offers promising huge discounts on a product or service. Sometimes, the offers come via mail. Sometimes, they come via e-mail or a phone call. Oftentimes, the offers are part of an invitation to accept a new credit card.Then, the recipient of the offer begins reading the fine print. Yes, the offer is valid, but it also requires too much work to collect. ""Who has the time to do all of this?"" many people think to themselves. ""My time is valuable. Saving money isn't worth it if I have to spend a lot of time on this.""A new startup in Raleigh, North Carolina called RewardStock claims it has solved the problem of consumers spending too much time trying to figure out how to get discounts on travel. In this videotaped presentation, RewardStock CEO Jonathan Hayes explains that credit card companies often offer seemingly great discounts via points collected by using credit cards, but people often don't take advantage of the offers because they're too complicated. RewardStock, he adds, has figured out a way to make collecting points -- and discounts -- much simpler.""We only show you an offer when it solves the travel goal that you have already told us you have,"" Hayes told his audience.Unfortunately, Hayes didn't detail in his presentation how RewardStock has figured out how prospective travelers will save money via points discounts. He did detail how he has saved a tremendous amount of money on trips to numerous locales, including Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Istanbul, London, Miami, New Orleans, Paris, and San Diego. His point was that millions of people could save money traveling to their favorite destinations. If RewardStock could do that for people, it does indeed have a tremendous service, but the devil is in the details.Reporters who have interviewed Hayes have provided more detail than he did in his presentation. The highly-regarded newspaper The News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C. reports that the RewardStock website will help prospective travelers ""find the best way to use those rewards for the trip they have in mind"" and will ""outline strategies for obtaining additional points."" The prospective travelers pay zero for this service so it appears to be a great deal.In addition, Hayes told a technology news publication named Xconomy in this article that RewardStock software can ""recommend which new (credit) cards will offer rewards that will best help a user reach his or her travel goal."" This sounds like a fabulous service for travelers AND the credit card companies.It should be pointed out that Hayes is marketing RewardStock as a solution for two problems -- the problems that prospective travelers have getting discounts and the problems that credit card companies have finding prospective cardholders. Essentially, he is seeking to kill two birds with one stone by hooking up travelers and credit card companies that are selling travel packages.In his presentation, Hayes notes the incredible prices that you can find via travel discount offers. He detailed two trips that he took that cost him only a few hundred dollars because he used points offered by credit cards. If he had to pay cash, he said, the trips would have cost him several thousand dollars.The Xconomy article corroborates that there is a huge market for consumers who earned reward points from credit card companies, but didn't use them.""Consumers are leaving a lot of rewards points on the table,"" the article reports. ""Colloquy, a research firm focused on loyalty marketing, counted 578 million members in credit card reward programs in 2015. Of some $48 billion in rewards value issued annually, $16 billion goes unredeemed, according to a 2011 Colloquy report.""Hayes also noted in his presentation that credit card companies spend $17 billion marketing their products, largely in an effort to sign up new customers. The RewardStock business plan includes the company getting paid by a credit card company whenever it approves a new customer who applied for the card via a link on the RewardStock website.""We are a strategic financial planning tool for users and a highly targeted marketing tool for the credit card issuers,"" Hayes said.The market is definitely there for the RewardStock service -- both on the consumer side and the business side. The service also seems incredibly promising. So does the business plan. Whether the service is as good as advertised will depend on whether it really can save consumers thousands of dollars in travel expenses AND simultaneously save them the considerable time and effort that they are now expending to realize travel expense savings."

You will realize that it's important for you to continue showing up and allowing people to see you're trying. It helps others understand they're not alone, and it's okay for them to try, too.",2016-04-10,2016-04-01-1459545657-5764512-beforeafterracepic.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-01-1459545657-5764512-beforeafterracepic-thumb.jpg,"The size of my body was a daily burden to me. Some days, it was the frustration of not being able to find clothes in my size at department stores. It was an epic excursion just to find a simple white button down blouse and black slacks to wear to work as part of the required uniform. Other days, it was the physical exhaustion and pain of doing manual labor at my workplace and carrying around an extra 150 pounds all day (every day) while my average-sized co-workers assumed I was lazy for taking more breaks than them. And on especially low days, it was the feeling that the only kind of man who'd ever be interested in me was a freak or total loser. Who could be attracted to and fall in love with a woman who couldn't even see her own vagina without a handheld mirror? I accepted that any flirtation that happened with the opposite sex would never end with a real relationship. These were just a few of many reasons I sought comfort in food and alcohol and suffered from mild depression since the age of 10. It was the judgment from others, how much harder life felt for me because of my size, and the fear that I would grow old alone. At that time in my life, it was impossible to hear messages that claimed I just needed to love my body more, be nicer to myself, and trust the process. I was in such a low place of despair most days that it only made sense to either accept my body size as a life sentence or bully myself into trying fad diets and damn near starving myself in the process. When I started my last weight loss journey seven years ago (weighing 300 pounds), I wish someone I trusted and respected had told me these three little-known truths that would have saved me a lot of heartache and frustration: Everyone thinks they have it the hardest.All of us have something that holds us back and makes life harder. For me, it felt like I was destined to be morbidly obese for the rest of my life because my entire family was. I wasn't a genetic rock star. I also felt like I couldn't get healthier because I was living paycheck to paycheck and couldn't afford a gym membership or healthier foods. Some folks have family responsibilities that take up a lot of time and energy, the stress of studying for school exams, hormonal issues with the thyroid or PCOS, or other genuine physical limitations and disabilities. We all have something that makes reaching our goals more difficult. It's easy to forget that when you're in the trenches of trying to improve your life. When you're ready to start making big changes, barriers will come up left and right. Sometimes, they will seem like the truth and sometimes they'll just sound silly. It's a test. You have the choice to allow those obstacles to continue to hold you back, or you will find creative solutions around them. The best thing you can do is be truthful with the excuses you make for yourself right now, instead of thinking about what your ideal self can do. I know my ideal self would be able to workout in front of her television to a fitness DVD, prepare all of her meals fresh each day, and have a never-ending supply of energy. My real self needs to join a gym for variety and accountability. She also needs to prepare some of her meals ahead of time or rely on a few pre-made meals from the freezer section of the grocery store. She's also going to be tired at the end of the day, so she needs to recognize that her willpower will be depleted and will need to set up a plan to avoid making poor decisions after 5 p.m. Some days, just showing up is good enough.Fast sells. Complicated sells. A good majority of people have an all-or-nothing mindset--that's why quick results are favorable and complex techniques are viewed as superior to what's simple. It's all about the marketing. It will also leave you feeling worthless when change doesn't happen overnight, and you can't keep up with the complex routine you're supposed to follow. Despite popular belief, you don't have to plan out every little thing about your weight loss journey. It never goes according to your plans anyway. Unexpected events will come up, and you'll need the flexibility to handle them. It's okay to fail and even momentarily give up. The very best thing you can do for yourself is to get back up and show up again and again. You don't have to give 110% at what you do. You don't have to go hard or go home. The truly successful person knows this. Perseverance can sometimes be painful, especially if you don't see any noticeable rewards. It really is a lifestyle change. You have to be willing to be in it for the long-haul. Some days will be amazing. Some days will suck. The more you learn to enjoy what you're doing, the easier it is to tolerate the crappy days and the lack of visible results.By the way, this also applies to starting a business, becoming a new mother, going back to school, etc. Keeping it simple and sticking with it is the best advice for any challenging endeavor. It's OK to try.I never wanted anyone to know I was trying. Trying to lose weight, trying to diet, or trying to exercise. To me, trying meant that I acknowledged I needed to change, and I needed help. And needing help was a sign of weakness. Just the thought of awkwardly pushing my big sweaty body through workouts in front of others made me squeamish and I dwelt on, ""What will they think of me?"" So, I foolishly delayed getting that gym membership for years. When I finally took the terrifying plunge of joining a gym, I realized very quickly that no one seemed to care what I was doing. No one rolled their eyes at me. No one commented that I was sweating too much. No one said I should be lifting weights instead of walking on the treadmill. No one stared at my naked body in the locker room as I changed. No one said a damn thing. Everyone was focused on their own workouts and their own bodies. Eventually, you'll no longer see trying as a vulnerability. You will realize that it's important for you to continue showing up and allowing people to see you're trying. It helps others understand they're not alone, and it's okay for them to try, too. Are you working on a weight loss journey and need to hear some words of encouragement?

My friends Angelica Ross and Cherno Biko, along with Daily Show contributor Jessica Williams used humor, common sense and courage to dispel some of the myths surrounding transgender identity and based on the social media response they received, they did a pretty good job. Unfortunately, we know that visibility alone won't stop the vicious attacks on the lives of transgender people. It won't stop the murders of transgender women of color, nor will it create jobs and safe affordable housing opportunities for our communities. For that to happen, we (the transgender community and our allies) must be more involved in the political process. As a transgender woman of color who worked as a Senior Policy to two City Councilmembers in the City of Minneapolis for 12 years combined, I know firsthand the importance of being involved in electoral politics. That is why when my friend and colleague Hayden Mora, asked me if I would be interested in joining a diverse group of trans people from all walks of life to build an explicitly political voice for trans people, without hesitation I said yes. On Monday, April 4th, 2016, Trans United Fund was born.  Trans United Fund will accomplish their mission by engaging transgender communities and allies in the political process, building political leadership and capacity of transgender people and allies and endorsing candidates with a commitment to transgender equality and a pro-transgender platform.The first-ever transgender-focused Presidential Candidate Questionnaire has been developed and will be distributed to all potential candidates as part of the 2016 election cycle. In addition, a legislative scorecard program and efforts related to building political power in trans communities and educating allies are in the works. The organization is looking at key races across the country in the 2016 election cycle to focus resources where they can make the most difference.""At a time when human rights and social justice struggles are at an all-time high, when Black Lives Matter advocates are insisting that the issues plaguing the African American community come to a screeching halt, issues like chronically failing schools, that create a direct pipeline to the for-profit prison system. Issues like, low to no access to quality healthcare, issues like environmental injustice that poison Black communities like Flint, MI, and communities all over this country. Issues like substandard housing, high unemployment and certainly violent and deadly interaction with the police state. We understand that these issues are systemic, they are a product of the White Supremacy infrastructure that this country was built upon and continues to uphold in all the institutions that our tax dollars support. We must understand that these very same issues have an even more significant impact on the part of our community that identifies as transgender, gender non-conforming, or gender fluid.   The National Black Justice Coalition, (NJBC) collaborated on the 2011 survey ""Injustice At Every Turn"", which lays out the staggering statistics that trans people generally and trans people of color in particular face on a daily basis.And as my dear friend Elle Hearns stated in the Root Article, ""Violence Against Trans Women largely goes Unnoticed"", from Jan.23rd, 2015, ""Religion plays a big part in how we deal with the LGBTQ community, period,"" Hearns said. ""But specifically trans women of color, there is a lot of misogyny that is compartmentalized, and a lot of people don't want to deal with trans, even the word 'trans,' because it challenges everything that they've been taught by systems of oppression and white supremacy.""I'm part of the Trans United Fund because trans people need a strong political voice to support the activism, legal, policy and direct service work already happening. As the Oral Historian for the Tretter Collection Transgender Oral Project, I hear the stories and lived narratives of trans and gender non-conforming people on an almost daily basis. As a poet and writer, I share my own experiences, thoughts and ideas related fighting for justice and equality for all people. But sharing our stories, being visible and even providing direct services to members of our communities is not enough. As friend and co-founder of the Trans United Fund's Bamby Salcedo, Executive Director of the Trans Latin@ Coalition said, ""We need to move from being primarily reactive to more proactive, going to the root of institutionalized transphobia. And that requires a stronger political voice.""These anti-trans bills being passed in Houston, North Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi don't just harm transgender people; they strip the rights of immigrants seeking employment and housing opportunities, women and their ability to make choices about their own bodies, they discriminate against disabled folks who sometimes need opposite gendered caregivers to assist them in the bathroom. Indeed, these bills make a mockery of our entire way of life in a democratic society. Trans United Fund, to me, is both about aggregating our collective power and about bringing our full selves to the table.   ""For me, there is no separating my womanness, my blackness, my transness from my me-ness"" - Janet Mock. This is our life, this is our time, let's work together to build a strong political voice for trans rights and in turn we create equality and equity for all. I hope that others in the trans community and our allies will join me today in being a part of Trans United Fund."

That shopworn notion from the 19th century is still harming girls from elementary school on up -- female students drop out of the science, math and tech pipeline around the time they hit junior high.But there's one number women understand very well -- the gender pay gap. At 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, the needle hasn't moved in over a decade. Pay Equity Day -- the day every year when women catch up with what men earned by the previous December 31 -- is April 12. Never mind that paying women less than men for substantially the same work has been illegal since the 1960s.One big reason the pay gap is so stubborn is that women can't find out what they're making compared to the guys alongside them. Many employers prohibit talking about pay with co-workers, and god forbid a company should publish its statistics on pay, gender and job category.In 2014, President Obama took a small step for womankind when he issued a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of Labor to ""develop a compensation data collection proposal"" for federal contractors. That proposed mechanism was announced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in February of this year. In plain English, it will require contractors add employee wages to the long-existing reporting requirements on race, gender, and job categories. (The info still won't be public, but at least those charged with enforcing the law will have it.) After all, federal contractors are benefiting from our tax dollars, and we deserve to know they're being fair to employees. It's a simple matter of transparency on the part of those doing business with the government, not to mention government accountability to taxpayers. While they may not be too hot on the transparency part, Republicans have been wailing and gnashing their teeth about government accountability since government was invented. Now that they have a chance to get a small measure of it with this new rule, they don't want it after all.The ink wasn't dry on the proposal before Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) fired off a bill to derail it. His ""EEOC Reform Act"" demands that the entire backlog of pay discrimination cases be cleared before any more data can be collected from offending companies. Ironically, the bill also contains an outright admission that the agency is understaffed and underfunded. If Republicans really cared about the EEOC's ""mission not accomplished"" record due to budget starvation, it would increase funding for investigation and prosecution of giant corporations getting fat off our tax dollars -- while women working for them still slave away for 79 cents on the dollar.Happy Pay (In)equity Day."

The New York Democratic primary is scheduled for April 19th. (Photo by Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb939cc2500008e013a6fe4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the Sanders surge continues, the Democratic presidential contest has gotten chippy. After Clinton called Sanders ""unprepared"" to be president, Sanders responded he thought she was ""unqualified.""The chattering classes went off. Democrats were rending garments and ringing hands worried about the campaign getting too negative and personal. Guy Cecil, director of one of the Clinton armory of SuperPacs, played the inevitable sexist card. President Obama felt it necessary to weigh in, with his spokesman Eric Schultz saying Obama believes Clinton"" comes to the race with more experience than any non-vice president in recent campaign history."" More experience, in other words, than anyone except Al Gore, daddy Bush and Richard Nixon. But the kerfuffle was all nonsense. Sanders doesn't think Clinton is ""unqualified,"" as he quickly acknowledged. He has repeatedly paid respect to her experience and qualifications. And the rhetorical misstatement frankly wasn't all that harsh. Qualifications haven't been the centerpiece of the Sanders-Clinton race, but they were in the Clinton-Obama face-off in 2008. They didn't differ all that much on ideology or program. Clinton's major attack on Obama was that he was simply unqualified. Remember the ad with the ominous call at 3:00 in the morning? And for harsh rhetoric, Sanders' misstatement was nothing compared to Clinton's scorning Obama in comparison to her and their putative Republican opponent, John McCain. Senator McCain, she said, ""will put forth his lifetime of experience. I will put forth my lifetime of experience. Senator Obama will put forth a speech he made in 2002."" Ouch.Sanders' critique of Clinton isn't that she is unqualified or inexperienced. It is far tougher and more substantive. His campaign is premised on the belief that she is too compromised and conservative to be the president we need. It isn't about character or experience; it is about direction, program and independence.Sanders argues that our economy is rigged to favor the few, and our politics is corrupted by the big money, special interests and revolving door appointments that keep fixing the game. He argues we need fundamental change, not simply piecemeal or incremental reform if we are to make this economy work for working people once more. Sanders is running because he believes that Clinton is too compromised in her agenda. He has defined major substantive areas of disagreement: on corporate trade policies, on the need for major public investment and a sweeping initiative to take on global warming, on national health care, on breaking up the big banks and curbing Wall Street, on progressive taxation that will pay for tuition free public college, on $15.00 an hour minimum wage and empowering workers to organize, on dialing down our interventionist foreign policy and more. Clinton has moved to adopt a bolder reform position this year than in 2008 or before. She's basically at one with President Obama's policies. Yes, she's come out against the president's Transpacific Partnership deal, but everyone believes that is just campaign positioning. She claims to be tough on Wall Street, but even her Wall Street donors don't believe her. She's assiduously avoided embracing the Warren-Sanders reform agenda. She's put forth a good agenda on global warming, but opposes putting a price on carbon, opposes banning fracking, and hasn't made climate change a centerpiece of her campaign. She's scorned Sanders call for national health care or for tuition free college. She's been a supporter of the regime change follies from Iraq, to Honduras to Libya to Syria to the Ukraine. Sanders also argues that Clinton is too compromised by the big money that is central to financing her campaign. He decided to forego any SuperPacs and to crowd source the financing of his campaign because he believes that big money compromises candidates. Clinton claims this insults her character. But everyday experience and a legion of academic studies prove that money perverts our politics, that the wealthy and the entrenched interests get their way, even when the majority are opposed. It's nice to blame Republican obstruction, but the heart of the economic policies that are failing working people - corporate trade deals, deregulation, skewed and loophole ridden tax code, starved public investment, corporate subsidies and crony capitalist arrangements and much more - enjoy bipartisan support. Clinton harshly attacked Obama as unqualified in 2008. But the harsh rhetoric didn't get in the way of the party uniting in the fall. Whatever the differences inflated for the primaries, the two basically agreed on politics and policies. And, of course, both were both funded by similar deep pockets. Sanders has been -- despite all the fretting inside the beltway -- a remarkably courtly opponent to Clinton. He hasn't unleashed oppo research on the numerous Clinton scandals. He's irate about her distorting his record - on guns, on the auto bailout, on the crime bill -- but he's largely kept his focus on the substantive differences between them. This includes the indictment on how she funds her campaigns and her collecting millions in speaking fees from Wall Street banks and other corporate interests -- an argument central to the case he is making. Despite the relative mannerliness of the Democratic race, bringing the party together after the primaries won't be easy. Sanders has built a movement that is challenging the fundamental direction of the country and the central way the party does business (and business does the party). Those differences are much harder to paper over than personal insults issued by tired candidates in the New York hothouse. Both Sanders and Clinton will endorse whomever becomes the nominee, but Democrats will need a wingnut Republican opponent to help unite the party in the fall. Luckily, Republicans seem intent on serving one up."

Stock Photo. Pixabay.comWomen's-rights groups have been campaigning for a decade for a domestic-violence law in Armenia.So far all their efforts have failed. Depending on the session of parliament, lawmakers have either refused to take up the legislation or voted it down.This year, Armenia may finally see a law that protects women from partner violence.If it happens, it's likely to be because of a European Union financial inducement rather than any sudden Armenian government and lawmaker enlightenment on domestic abuse.The EU is making an 11-million-euro grant that it calls the Human Rights Budget Support Program contingent on Armenia adopting a domestic-violence law. The financing covers the years 2016 to 2018.The European incentive comes on top of the United Nations prodding Armenia a year ago about its lack of a domestic-abuse law. The criticism came in the UN's Second Universal Periodic Review of Armenia.As in all former Soviet states that lack domestic-violence legislation -- and that's most of them -- Armenia needs a law to protect women from repeat battering.With rare exceptions, police bring charges against an abuser only when it's too late -- that is, when the victim has been murdered or crippled.Current Armenian law allows police to file charges against anyone who commits an assault, whether the injuries are mild, medium or severe.If a man who batters a woman is not her partner, however -- if he's an acquaintance or stranger, say -- police are likely to bring an assault case against him even if the injuries are mild.If the attacker is a partner, though, police consider the assault a family matter, and lean on the partners to work things out.It's hard for police to get their heads around the idea of domestic abuse when Armenian society has long had the axiom that: ""A woman is like wool: The more you beat her, the softer she will be.""In the few instances where a victim insists on police filing charges, if she has suffered only mild or medium injury, they usually refuse.This means the victim continues to be trapped in the cycle of battering. Since domestic violence often becomes more frequent and more severe over time, she risks debilitating injury or death if she stays in the relationship.One way out would be to flee the abusive environment, of course -- but the odds against a victim doing so are slim.Most Armenian women give up careers when they marry, or never have them in the first place, and men tightly control the family's purse strings. This means that the vast majority of wives and live-in girlfriends have no money to start a life of their own. In addition, Armenia has only a handful of battered-women's shelters, and the time that a victim can stay in one is limited.You might think a sensible option would be a battered woman moving in with her parents. But in Armenia, where divorce is frowned on, many parents would condemn their daughter for not doing enough to save the marriage -- and refuse to take her in. The domestic-abuse legislation that women's-rights groups have been pushing would almost certainly prevent some battered-women deaths and maimings.That's because, for the first time, it would give judges the power to issue restraining orders to keep batterers away from victims.Attackers would think twice against violating such an order because it would lead to jail time.Those who support an Armenian domestic-abuse law offer some sobering statistics to make their case.One is that a quarter of all married women have suffered domestic violence at one time or another, according to the National Statistical Service.Another telling statistic is that a quarter of the 1,759 cases of violence against women that the National Police recorded in the first nine months of 2014 involved domestic abuse.An even starker statistic is that 30 Armenian women have been killed by their partners since 2010 -- a sizable number for a country of 3 million.Many of the government leaders who oppose a domestic-violence law have offered as a justification the fact that the legislation would impose additional financial costs on the state.One provision, for example, would require the government to increase the number of battered-women's shelters across the country, and pay for their operations.At the moment, not even one kopek of taxpayer money goes to shelters. The few that are available are funded by non-governmental organizations. But the main justification that opponents of the legislation use is that a domestic-abuse law is unnecessary because current law covers assault and battery, including domestic violence.But given the police's reluctance to file charges in all but the most horrific domestic-battering cases, and the current law's lack of a restraining-order provision to protect women from continued battering, the argument that a specific domestic-abuse law is unnecessary fails to pass muster. Studies in a number of countries have shown a direct correlation between enactment of a domestic-abuse law and a decline in partner violence against women.The European Union's current financial inducement for Armenia to pass a domestic-violence law does not guarantee it will happen, of course.But it is the best chance its proponents have ever had to help reduce partner battering.Armine Sahakyan is a human rights activist based in Armenia.

At least 12 homes and around 100 other structures were destroyed by the flames.Prosecutors said Huntsman fled the scene of the fire and encountered a Good Samaritan who offered to give him a ride out of the area.Huntsman showed the driver a selfie-style video he took of himself standing between two of the fire's points of origin.""Listen, I got fire all around me,"" Huntsman says in the video, which was provided by the prosecutor's office.

It revealed that some landlords fail to remove peeling lead paint from apartments with children, because it is more cost-effective to make repairs only after city inspectors notify them of dangerous lead conditions.“All of the agencies have to do better enforcement, better inspection,” James said, adding that addressing dangerous lead conditions should be a priority.While lead in water has been making headlines in places like Flint, Michigan, in New York lead paint is one of the biggest sources of lead poisoning for small children, according to the health department. The Local Law 1, that was passed in 2004, requires landlords to remove chipping or chalking lead paint from apartments with children under the age of six. But advocates have criticized the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development for failing to implement an effective system to conduct inspections that are not complaint-driven and collect fines from violators. Ian Davie, a housing lawyer formerly with the Bronx Legal Services, told HuffPost that it's very difficult to hold landlords accountable. “You need to have a license to run a hotdog stand but you don’t need a license to rent an apartment where people live,” he said.From November 2013 to January 2016, the HPD has issued more than 10,000 violations for dangerous lead paint conditions, according to the HuffPost/WNYC analysis. A few zip codes in Northern Manhattan, the Bronx and Brooklyn accounted for half of those violations. About 10 percent of the nearly 2,000 landlords who were issued lead paint violations during that two-year span were responsible for most of the violations. The HuffPost/WNYC analysis was based on the HPD database of housing code violations, owner registration and property records. “We are committed to identifying children who may be at risk of lead exposure,” said a health department spokesperson in an emailed statement. “We will continue to zero in our efforts in the communities that are the most vulnerable.”The housing department did not respond to requests for comment.Since 2004, when the law was implemented, there has been an 80 percent drop in the number of New York children with a blood lead level above the Centers for Disease Control threshold of 5 micrograms per deciliter. However, in 2014 more than 6,000 had a blood lead level above that threshold, according to health department data.The HuffPost/WNYC report identified landlords Moshe Piller and Ved Parkash among those with the highest number of lead paint violations over the past two years. And in the past decade more than 10 families have sued the landlords alleging their children were exposed to the toxic metal because peeling lead paint had not been removed from their apartments.On Monday, 38 tenants filed a lawsuit against Parkash claiming their homes, in one of his buildings in the Bronx, don’t meet the standards of habitability and have hundreds of uncorrected maintenance issues, including peeling lead paint, according to the New York Daily News. The building, at 750 Grand Concourse had three lead paint violations between November 2013 and January 2016, according to the HuffPost/WNYC report.“It’s unconscionable,” said James. “These people live in these conditions and he continues to collect the rent.”"

They also cited an alleged incident that occurred during a wrestling trip in a motel room.Although statutes of limitations bar sexual abuse charges against Hastert, ""with this case the government seeks to hold defendant accountable for the crimes he committed that can still be prosecuted,"" the court filing said.Asked by Reuters if Hastert or his lawyers would comment on the court filing, a pre-sentencing memorandum, Hastert attorney Thomas Green issued a statement that neither confirmed nor denied the allegations.Hastert ""acknowledges that as a young man he committed transgressions for which he is profoundly sorry,"" the statement said. ""He earnestly apologizes to his former students, family, friends, previous constituents and all others affected by the harm his actions have caused.""The wording closely mirrored a similar expression of remorse contained in a pre-sentencing memo filed by the defense earlier this week. It differed, however, in expressly mentioning ""former students.""The defense has asked the federal judge in the case to spare Hastert prison time, citing his deteriorating health, his remorse and years he ""dedicated to public service."" Prosecutors have recommended a prison term of no more than six months.Sentencing is scheduled for April 27.(Reporting by Letitia Stein in Tampa and Joseph Ax in New York; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Tom Brown)Open in New WindowDownload PackageCreate New CollectionShare via EmailPrintDate09/04/2016 19:34Pictures6Word Count434Source News FeedsUS Online Report Politics News,US Online Report Top NewsIDtag:reuters.com,2016:newsml_KCN0X60TS:2"

A court just decided they have the right to return to their jobs. Above, a Beach Club sandwich from the chain.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5707ebef1e0000b3007068db.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's been five years since Mike Wilklow was slinging sandwiches at a Jimmy John's shop in Minneapolis. No longer a 20-something activist, Wilklow is 31 years old and punching the clock as a computer programmer, earning far more than he did during his fast-food days. And yet, thanks to some recent legal developments, Wilklow now finds himself pondering a return to Jimmy John's to dress Totally Tunas for next to minimum wage.""I definitely don't need the money,"" Wilklow told The Huffington Post. ""But I'd go back. Maybe just work the weekends. I'd do it out of bitterness, if nothing else.""In 2011, Wilklow and five of his friends were fired by the Jimmy John's franchisee they worked for, a company called MikLin Enterprises. The group had led an effort to unionize roughly 170 Jimmy John's employees who worked at 10 shops in the Minneapolis area, coming painfully close to notching a landmark labor victory in the union-free world of fast food. The group of workers -- let's call them the Jimmy John's Six -- were fired after publicly shaming the company for not providing employees with paid sick days. Wilklow and his buddies maintained that the firings were illegal retaliation for union activity. They filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board, asking for their old jobs back, with backpay. So far, the powers that be have agreed with the workers every step of the way. In 2012, an administrative law judge determined Wilklow and the gang were illegally fired and should be reinstated. In 2014, the NLRB affirmed the judge's ruling. And just last week, a federal appeals court upheld the board's decision.MikLin Enterprises can drag out the case even further by appealing the latest ruling to the Supreme Court, but that doesn't mean the justices will choose to hear the case. The company is running out of options in this fight. In a statement sent to HuffPost through a spokesman, the company said it was ""disappointed"" by the decision and is ""currently evaluating its options for continuing to protect its interests."" It declined to comment beyond that. (Illinois-based Jimmy John's itself did not employ the workers, so it is not a party to the case.)On its surface, the case would seem to be an example of the system working -- protecting vulnerable, low-wage employees who exert their rights in the workplace. But instead, the case shows just how weak labor law really is.If you're an employer who wants to snuff out an organizing campaign, there isn't much to stop you. Workers have a right to what's called ""protected concerted activity,"" but the penalties for violating those rights are pretty meager. If the labor board finds you at fault, you owe the worker backpay and reinstatement. That is, you owe her whatever wages you would have paid her since her firing -- minus any wages she collected after getting hired elsewhere. And you must offer to reinstate her at her old job, where management despises her enough to have fired her in the first place.""The workers have won, technically. But in reality, have they?"" asks Moshe Marvit, a labor lawyer who co-wrote a book, Why Labor Organizing Should Be a Civil Right, arguing that employers need to be subject to stiffer penalties for union-busting. ""They can come back to a job that very few of them will come back to. And even if they do come back, it's sent a message to other workers that you may have legal rights, but what does that matter if you'll not be able to keep your job?"" Given the weak penalties for it, retaliating against union agitators becomes a rational economic decision for businesses to make, Marvit said. ""Even if you're not anti-union, you're just looking at the bottom line,"" he said. ""Look at the costs and benefits of violating a worker's rights, and it makes sense to.""Even when workers prevail in these cases, it often takes years to win their jobs back or finally see those back wages, thanks to appeals. By then, the wind has long since fallen from the sails of the original organizing campaign. The employment rolls have turned over, and the workers winning reinstatement have already moved on with their lives. Just consider the case of Jimmy John's.Max Specktor is one of the six workers who the judge ordered reinstated. His commute to the Minneapolis Jimmy John's won't be easy. He now lives in Fairbanks, Alaska. He moved there in June and found work in a diesel mechanic's shop. Like most people who light out for Alaska, Specktor was looking for a fresh start -- not necessarily a return to making Vito Italian subs back home. And yet he said he was excited to hear about the appeals decision last week. ""I guess we'll cross that bridge when it happens,"" Specktor said of the possibility of working again at Jimmy John's. ""A lot of people are interested in going back. A few still live in Minneapolis. Maybe I could help long-distance. I don't know.""Specktor said the delays and complications in their case are ""by design,"" to help employers rather than workers.""We already knew this is what the system is set up like,"" he said.His friend David Boehnke agrees. At 30 years old, Boehnke still lives in Minneapolis, now working as a high school teacher. In his spare time he's still an active organizer, trying to improve conditions for workers in prison. He said the prospect of donning the Jimmy John's apron again intrigues him. ""I think it just depends on whether or not there's an ability to get something done,"" Boehnke said. ""Clearly, people still need a union in fast food. We'll have to see what's possible."" As for the legal system they face, ""It wasn't built for us and it's not going to run for us. It's the context we have to live and work in. It's clearly set up to stop organizing.""""I feel like the whole situation is absurd and we should have been back at work long ago,"" said Erik Forman, another fired worker. ""This is extremely dysfunctional. Justice delayed and justice denied. It's a textbook case.""Still, Forman said he would not hesitate to return to Jimmy John's -- even though he is now a high school history teacher in the Bronx. ""We're excited to go back to work and finish the job,"" he said.""It would be like getting an aging rock band back together,"" offered Wilklow. ""I'm in my 30s now. I could probably do union organizing, but I'd be an old guy there now.""If this crew seems surprisingly open to a Jimmy John's reunion tour, the union they're affiliated with could help explain why. The Jimmy John's organizing effort is a project of the Industrial Workers of the World, a.k.a. the Wobblies, a union that has radical roots and resides on the fringe of U.S. organized labor. Membership-wise, the IWW is a shadow of its early 20th century self, but its militant members are still organizing in a hard-to-organize corner of the U.S. economy: fast food and retail, particularly Jimmy John's and Starbucks. The union is scrappy; the Jimmy John's Six did much of their own legal work before getting pro-bono assistance, according to Forman. After their firings, the group mocked up a picture that captured their flinty, irreverent ethos. It featured their portraits, along with some self-congratulations for getting canned. ""After fighting for paid sick days and better working conditions for all Jimmy John's workers, they've all been granted unpaid vacations!"" the picture read. It asked ""just how far"" MikLin Enterprises would go ""to screw over their employees,"" and said the workers now had ""all the time in the world"" to fight to win their jobs back.In many ways, the Jimmy John's campaign was ahead of its time. Unions face immense barriers in trying to unionize fast food, including the fragmentation of the industry through franchising, and the sky-high turnover rate among employees. And yet the Minneapolis Jimmy John's workers almost pulled it off. In 2010, they lost a heartbreaker of an election -- 85 yes votes to 87 no -- following what the workers described as an intense anti-union campaign by MikLin Enterprises. The idea of organizing fast food doesn't seem so quixotic anymore. In 2012, fast food workers launched what's become known as the Fight for $15. The workers have periodically gone on strike in cities around the country, protesting low pay and shaming the likes of McDonald's and Pizza Hut. It is undoubtedly one of the most successful labor campaigns of modern times, shaking the entire industry and spurring minimum wage hikes around the country. In recent weeks, both New York and California passed $15 state minimum wage laws -- a development that seemed preposterous just three years ago.The Fight for $15 campaign has been coordinated by the powerful Service Employees International Union, which boasts 2 million members and vastly deeper pockets than the IWW. (Unlike the IWW, SEIU has not filed for union elections at individual fast-food restaurants, renouncing a piecemeal approach through the labor board.) Watching the triumphs of the Fight for $15 has been heartening, Boehnke said. ""I know they paid close attention to the work that we did. Insofar as [we made] a contribution to that, it's an important thing."" The Jimmy John's campaign was prescient in another way: The workers publicly embarrassed their company for not offering paid sick days. Sick leave has since become a cause du jour for labor and its allies. The Jimmy John's workers wisely argued that their lack of sick leave was a threat to public health, since they handled food for a living. They hung up posters that featured two identical photos of a Jimmy John's sandwich, one purportedly made by a healthy worker, the other by a sick worker. ""Can't tell the difference?"" the poster asked. ""That's too bad because Jimmy John's workers don't get paid sick days."" That aggressive bit of shaming precipitated their pink slips. With the loss of a half-dozen lead organizers, the Minneapolis Jimmy John's campaign fizzled. There hasn't been another attempt at an election there since. (The IWW campaign is still active elsewhere, however, particularly in Baltimore.)""I take the long view of the whole situation,"" said Forman. ""We see what we were part of as the beginning, in a lot of ways, of a broader movement in fast food. People said this was crazy. Now, it's almost common sense that this needs to happen. I'm happy we carried the torch in that first little stretch.""If MikLin Enterprises declines to appeal the most recent ruling, the company will be compelled to offer the six workers backpay and reinstatement on the job. Most -- if not all -- of their old colleagues would be gone if they returned, a natural result of industry turnover. How much backpay they're owed would depend on how quickly they found new jobs. Given that they were making fast-food money to begin with, the payout will inevitably be modest. For a computer programmer like Wilklow, the money is now beside the point anyway.""They killed the union campaign,"" Wilklow said. ""They can't give us that back.""Correction: This post originally suggested the IWW campaign had little support from other, more mainstream unions. In fact, other unions volunteered to staff the campaign."

Unions face immense barriers in trying to unionize fast food, including the fragmentation of the industry through franchising, and the sky-high turnover rate among employees. And yet the Minneapolis Jimmy John's workers almost pulled it off. In 2010, they lost a heartbreaker of an election -- 85 yes votes to 87 no -- following what the workers described as an intense anti-union campaign by MikLin Enterprises. The idea of organizing fast food doesn't seem so quixotic anymore. In 2012, fast food workers launched what's become known as the Fight for $15. The workers have periodically gone on strike in cities around the country, protesting low pay and shaming the likes of McDonald's and Pizza Hut. It is undoubtedly one of the most successful labor campaigns of modern times, shaking the entire industry and spurring minimum wage hikes around the country. In recent weeks, both New York and California passed $15 state minimum wage laws -- a development that seemed preposterous just three years ago.The Fight for $15 campaign has been coordinated by the powerful Service Employees International Union, which boasts 2 million members and vastly deeper pockets than the IWW. (Unlike the IWW, SEIU has not filed for union elections at individual fast-food restaurants, renouncing a piecemeal approach through the labor board.) Watching the triumphs of the Fight for $15 has been heartening, Boehnke said. ""I know they paid close attention to the work that we did. Insofar as [we made] a contribution to that, it's an important thing."" The Jimmy John's campaign was prescient in another way: The workers publicly embarrassed their company for not offering paid sick days. Sick leave has since become a cause du jour for labor and its allies. The Jimmy John's workers wisely argued that their lack of sick leave was a threat to public health, since they handled food for a living. They hung up posters that featured two identical photos of a Jimmy John's sandwich, one purportedly made by a healthy worker, the other by a sick worker. ""Can't tell the difference?"" the poster asked. ""That's too bad because Jimmy John's workers don't get paid sick days."" That aggressive bit of shaming precipitated their pink slips. With the loss of a half-dozen lead organizers, the Minneapolis Jimmy John's campaign fizzled. There hasn't been another attempt at an election there since. (The IWW campaign is still active elsewhere, however, particularly in Baltimore.)""I take the long view of the whole situation,"" said Forman. ""We see what we were part of as the beginning, in a lot of ways, of a broader movement in fast food. People said this was crazy. Now, it's almost common sense that this needs to happen. I'm happy we carried the torch in that first little stretch.""If MikLin Enterprises declines to appeal the most recent ruling, the company will be compelled to offer the six workers backpay and reinstatement on the job. Most -- if not all -- of their old colleagues would be gone if they returned, a natural result of industry turnover. How much backpay they're owed would depend on how quickly they found new jobs. Given that they were making fast-food money to begin with, the payout will inevitably be modest. For a computer programmer like Wilklow, the money is now beside the point anyway.""They killed the union campaign,"" Wilklow said. ""They can't give us that back.""Correction: This post originally suggested the IWW campaign had little support from other, more mainstream unions. In fact, other unions volunteered to staff the campaign."

It took jurors just over two hours to reach the verdict.This was the second trial and conviction for Batey. He and a fellow former Vanderbilt football player, Brandon Vandenburg, were found guilty in January 2015 of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery but the judge declared a mistrial because one of the jurors had failed to disclose that he himself was a victim of rape.The victim in the Vanderbilt case, which drew national attention to sexual assaults on college campuses, had attended a party and was unconscious during the attack, which occurred in a dorm room on campus, prosecutors said.She testified as the final witness on Friday. The prosecution said it was pleased with the outcome. ""Justice has been done,"" said prosecutor Tom Thurman.Batey's attorneys said they planned to appeal. During the trial, lawyer Courtney Teasley placed the blame on Vandenburg, who she said used Batey, who was blacked out on alcohol, as his ""puppet"" during the incident.The two had been scheduled to be retried together, but one of Vandenburg's attorney's had medical issues, causing the cases to be severed and his retrial set for June.The trials of the last two accused former players, Jaborian ""Tip"" McKenzie and Brandon Banks, are expected to take place after Vandenburg’s retrial.Aggravated rape carries a sentence of 15-25 years in prison.

The Islamist militant group is trying to disrupt Somalia's political transition in 2016.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57081a9b1e00008700706931.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. This week, we speak with analyst Cedric Barnes about the international fight against the Somali Islamist militant group al Shabab.After a quarter-century of anarchy and war, Somalia is inching forward with a political process meant to set the African nation on the path to stability.Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud pledged to hold elections, finalize the constitution and determine the number and location of Somalia's federal states by 2016. Fierce political wrangling has accompanied each of these processes, and the election is now set to be decided by clan elders and regional representatives rather than by a popular vote. Yet it is a significant moment for the country, 25 years after feuding warlords exploited a power vacuum left by the fall of military dictator Siad Barre.Still, one group that emerged from the chaos, the al Qaeda-affiliated al Shabab, is determined to disrupt Somalia’s political transition.While the African Union force in Somalia, AMISOM, has been pushing al Shabab from its significant territorial strongholds since 2011, the militant group has redoubled attacks in recent months, terrorizing the capital with suicide bombings, ambushing AMISOM bases and recapturing cities in southern Somalia.At the same time, U.S. forces have intensified the military campaign against the group in Somalia, killing a regional intelligence head of al Shabab in a strike last week. Last month, the U.S. targeted the group in a deadly commando raid and bombed a training camp which the Pentagon said left 150 fighters dead.The WorldPost spoke to Cedric Barnes, the Horn of Africa project director for International Crisis Group, about the U.S. campaign against al Shabab and the critical months ahead for Somalia.What’s behind the latest U.S. strikes on al Shabab?I imagine it was a combination of reasons -- partly operational, if perhaps opportunities arose based on intelligence on plans or threats, and partly due to the need to do something to stop al Shabab’s recent run of successes that was rather undermining AMISOM’s role and the whole project for stabilizing Somalia, which the international community has invested so much in. After AMISOM pushed al Shabab out of the large parts of Somalia it controlled after 2011, there was no real stabilization plan, and that left a vacuum of sorts. Al Shabab, which was already quite a resilient organization, had time to recover. There have been a series of attacks on AMISOM bases in the last 12 months, and each one has increased in terms of ambition, the bounty they captured and the damage done against AMISOM’s reputation.As well as these more conventional insurgent attacks, al Shabab has also engaged in a constant war of attrition, especially in urban areas, which shows that al Shabab is still present and can penetrate right to the heart of areas seen as secure, such as Somali government offices. Somali and international officials may have declared that al Shabab had been defeated, a claim repeated by journalists, but that appears very much hollow and premature.How effective are U.S. strikes at rolling back al Shabab’s successes?They are effective, but only if they are followed up by meaningful political progress. That depends on greater consensus within the Somali political establishment, between Somalia’s neighbors and allies, and international donors and supporters. At the moment, that isn’t really there. People are working at cross-purposes. There is a lot of competition over the prize of Somalia at the moment, in terms of what the dividends could bring. Has killing al Shabab's leaders affected the group? It seemed like the U.S. strike in March departed from that strategy by apparently killing dozens of rank-and-file militants.The attack on the training camp was unusual, particularly for the U.S., although the Kenyan military says it conducts strikes like that fairly often. The recent strike on [al Shabab official] Hassan Ali Dhoore was in the same area, and in the last week, we’ve had claims of victory over al Shabab in the area. So it does appear to be more of a military strategy, coordinating with what AMISOM is doing in that part of Somalia. That attack seems to be slightly separate from the program of assassinations of particular leaders, most of whom appear to be people directly associated with al Shabab’s external activities. So this is not just about the war inside Somalia, but the wider counterterrorism war in East Africa.The assassinations must have had an impact on al Shabab to a certain extent, but they don’t appear to have a great deal of long-term impact on group. There are so many well-trained and ambitious individuals that they tend to fill the shoes of people who have been taken out. For a month or so after an assassination, you hear a lot of chatter about how al Shabab is split by infighting, but generally it seems to settle down quite quickly.In fact, the most potent threat to al Shabab recently has been from the Islamic State. Groups were potentially about to declare allegiance to the Islamic State in four different areas of Somalia. That really does seem to have rattled al Shabab. The group mobilized a lot of its forces to eliminate this internal threat extremely effectively. We still think there are elements who are still loyal to the Islamic State, but they’re keeping very quiet now. What is the rationale for the U.S. strikes? Does al Shabab pose a threat to the international community outside of Somalia?It’s not so much about defending the international community, but defending the international community’s support for the political project for Somalia, and especially the next stage -- the transfer of political office later this year. It’s hard to say just how much of a threat al Shabab poses externally. Over the last two to three years, al Shabab refocused its attention on Somalia, on its own internal security, and to a certain extent, on bringing this fight to neighboring states, especially Kenya. They’ll always take the opportunity to attack international interests, but how far afield they attempt to do that is a different matter. This is a big year for Somalia’s political transition. Does that pose a challenge for the security situation?The international community don’t want the election to be a repeat of 2012 -- a very abstract, clan-based selection process that’s done largely in Mogadishu. They want to bring it out into the hinterland. So they want to secure areas where there could be clan-based electoral colleges to try and make an indirect election slightly more direct. I don’t think the process itself is a risk to stability. I think the elite will more or less buy into the elections. It’s what happens afterwards that’s more unpredictable. You are not likely to have a central government that is more competent than the current one. There is still a lack of functioning institutions -- there’s no coherent legal code, for example. The greatest short- to medium-term problem is the quite hurried process of the establishment of the interim federal states. If there are clans who are perceived to have lost out in the federal state formation process, if they ally themselves with al Shabab in order to defend their influence and autonomy, that could be a problem. Is al Shabab going to try and disrupt the political transition?Yes, that will be its main objective. The process is already pretty stretched and does not have the greatest amount of legitimacy. Al Shabab is going to apply a lot of pressure, especially outside of Mogadishu, to stop any kind of representative process. How is al Shabab still such a disruptive force after all the years and billions of dollars spent trying to stop it? Where does the militant group get money and recruits?There’s a huge amount of unemployed youth in Somalia. There are two generations of Somalis who have never really enjoyed stability. Al Shabab is also recruiting an awful lot from East African countries like Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania -- a fact that has been severely underestimated until recently. The group always had a link with with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen, and that’s also been an underestimated conduit of people and expertise and money. There’s also plenty of money for the group within Somalia itself. They can tax directly in the areas they control. They do still control quite a lot of the rural areas, so even though the markets are controlled by AMISOM, people have to move out of al Shabab areas to reach the market. There’s also an informal means of taxation, which can either be voluntary or extracted with threats from the business community, especially in Mogadishu. Much as people hate to admit it, there is some sympathy for what al Shabab is doing. In a local area, al Shabab can say it’s defending minority clans against domination by majorities. There might be sympathy that al Shabab is defending Somalia against the interference of neighboring countries and the international community. And people might have genuine sympathy that al Shabab is one way to establish an Islamic order which, in the absence of any credible alternative in Somalia, some people still believe in.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."
34,THE WORLDPOST,The Fight To Stop Al Shabab From Disrupting Somalia’s Elections,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/al-shabab-somalia-elections_us_57081938e4b0885fb50d22e1,This is a critical year for the troubled African nation.,2016-04-09,"A father and his two sons watch a security operation in Mogadishu in 2013. Somalia will hold elections, but not by popular vote, later this year.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57081bb8150000ad000b4667.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. This week, we speak with analyst Cedric Barnes about the international fight against the Somali Islamist militant group al Shabab.After a quarter-century of anarchy and war, Somalia is inching forward with a political process meant to set the African nation on the path to stability.Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud pledged to hold elections, finalize the constitution and determine the number and location of Somalia's federal states by 2016. Fierce political wrangling has accompanied each of these processes, and the election is now set to be decided by clan elders and regional representatives rather than by a popular vote. Yet it is a significant moment for the country, 25 years after feuding warlords exploited a power vacuum left by the fall of military dictator Siad Barre.Still, one group that emerged from the chaos, the al Qaeda-affiliated al Shabab, is determined to disrupt Somalia’s political transition.While the African Union force in Somalia, AMISOM, has been pushing al Shabab from its significant territorial strongholds since 2011, the militant group has redoubled attacks in recent months, terrorizing the capital with suicide bombings, ambushing AMISOM bases and recapturing cities in southern Somalia.At the same time, U.S. forces have intensified the military campaign against the group in Somalia, killing a regional intelligence head of al Shabab in a strike last week. Last month, the U.S. targeted the group in a deadly commando raid and bombed a training camp which the Pentagon said left 150 fighters dead.The WorldPost spoke to Cedric Barnes, the Horn of Africa project director for International Crisis Group, about the U.S. campaign against al Shabab and the critical months ahead for Somalia.What’s behind the latest U.S. strikes on al Shabab?I imagine it was a combination of reasons -- partly operational, if perhaps opportunities arose based on intelligence on plans or threats, and partly due to the need to do something to stop al Shabab’s recent run of successes that was rather undermining AMISOM’s role and the whole project for stabilizing Somalia, which the international community has invested so much in. After AMISOM pushed al Shabab out of the large parts of Somalia it controlled after 2011, there was no real stabilization plan, and that left a vacuum of sorts. Al Shabab, which was already quite a resilient organization, had time to recover. There have been a series of attacks on AMISOM bases in the last 12 months, and each one has increased in terms of ambition, the bounty they captured and the damage done against AMISOM’s reputation.As well as these more conventional insurgent attacks, al Shabab has also engaged in a constant war of attrition, especially in urban areas, which shows that al Shabab is still present and can penetrate right to the heart of areas seen as secure, such as Somali government offices. Somali and international officials may have declared that al Shabab had been defeated, a claim repeated by journalists, but that appears very much hollow and premature.How effective are U.S. strikes at rolling back al Shabab’s successes?They are effective, but only if they are followed up by meaningful political progress. That depends on greater consensus within the Somali political establishment, between Somalia’s neighbors and allies, and international donors and supporters. At the moment, that isn’t really there. People are working at cross-purposes. There is a lot of competition over the prize of Somalia at the moment, in terms of what the dividends could bring. Has killing al Shabab's leaders affected the group? It seemed like the U.S. strike in March departed from that strategy by apparently killing dozens of rank-and-file militants.The attack on the training camp was unusual, particularly for the U.S., although the Kenyan military says it conducts strikes like that fairly often. The recent strike on [al Shabab official] Hassan Ali Dhoore was in the same area, and in the last week, we’ve had claims of victory over al Shabab in the area. So it does appear to be more of a military strategy, coordinating with what AMISOM is doing in that part of Somalia. That attack seems to be slightly separate from the program of assassinations of particular leaders, most of whom appear to be people directly associated with al Shabab’s external activities. So this is not just about the war inside Somalia, but the wider counterterrorism war in East Africa.The assassinations must have had an impact on al Shabab to a certain extent, but they don’t appear to have a great deal of long-term impact on group. There are so many well-trained and ambitious individuals that they tend to fill the shoes of people who have been taken out. For a month or so after an assassination, you hear a lot of chatter about how al Shabab is split by infighting, but generally it seems to settle down quite quickly.In fact, the most potent threat to al Shabab recently has been from the Islamic State. Groups were potentially about to declare allegiance to the Islamic State in four different areas of Somalia. That really does seem to have rattled al Shabab. The group mobilized a lot of its forces to eliminate this internal threat extremely effectively. We still think there are elements who are still loyal to the Islamic State, but they’re keeping very quiet now. What is the rationale for the U.S. strikes? Does al Shabab pose a threat to the international community outside of Somalia?It’s not so much about defending the international community, but defending the international community’s support for the political project for Somalia, and especially the next stage -- the transfer of political office later this year. It’s hard to say just how much of a threat al Shabab poses externally. Over the last two to three years, al Shabab refocused its attention on Somalia, on its own internal security, and to a certain extent, on bringing this fight to neighboring states, especially Kenya. They’ll always take the opportunity to attack international interests, but how far afield they attempt to do that is a different matter. This is a big year for Somalia’s political transition. Does that pose a challenge for the security situation?The international community don’t want the election to be a repeat of 2012 -- a very abstract, clan-based selection process that’s done largely in Mogadishu. They want to bring it out into the hinterland. So they want to secure areas where there could be clan-based electoral colleges to try and make an indirect election slightly more direct. I don’t think the process itself is a risk to stability. I think the elite will more or less buy into the elections. It’s what happens afterwards that’s more unpredictable. You are not likely to have a central government that is more competent than the current one. There is still a lack of functioning institutions -- there’s no coherent legal code, for example.

Garcia Padilla has said the GDB cannot afford the looming payment. While the island has defaulted on small debt payments in the past, a default at GDB would be the most serious yet.This week's order prevents GDB's depositors, such as municipalities and public agencies, from withdrawing their money, except to fund essential services.It also suspends minimum reserve requirements at GDB, and prevents the bank from lending money or making payments on debts that it guarantees.However, Garcia Padilla declined to exercise his authority to declare a moratorium on GDB's own $422 million May 1 debt payment, citing continuing restructuring talks between GDB and its creditors.""The Executive Order establishes reasonable and necessary procedures to preserve liquidity at GDB and allow it to continue its operations for the benefit of the health, safety and welfare of the people,"" he said in the statement.The essential services still allowed for withdrawal, in order of priority, include certain federal funds, payroll, and money for police, fire, medical, education and disaster recovery operations. The order establishes a committee of top island officials to manage these disbursements.Local efforts by GDB and other Puerto Rican debt issuers to reach a debt restructuring are running in parallel with plans in the U.S. Congress to draft legislation aimed at solving the island's economic crisis, possibly by allowing it to restructure debt and putting its finances under federal oversight.A new draft of that legislation is expected next week from the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources.Some Puerto Rico bondholders have criticized Garcia Padilla's emergency legislation, particularly the authority to issue a moratorium on any debt the governor deems necessary.Daniel Hanson, an analyst at Height Securities, said in a note this week the law could draw lawsuits from creditors.Rating agency Moody's said in a note on Friday that it would define a non-payment at GDB as a default ""regardless of (a debt) moratorium law's provisions.""(Reporting By Nick Brown in San Juan; Editing by Daniel Bases, Tom Heneghan and Bill Rigby)"

The 2015 film grossed more than $1.5 billion worldwide, making it among the highest-earning films of all time.Milam said the actor's daughter was continuing her lawsuit against Porsche AG and that she ""intends to hold the company responsible for producing a vehicle that was defective and caused Paul Walker's death.""Meadow Walker, the actor's only child and sole heir, filed the complaint against the German automaker last September, accusing it of skimping on safety features that could have prevented the crash or at least kept him alive.Porsche has maintained that the actor was responsible for his own death. After a four-month investigation, Los Angeles officials said the crash was caused by excessive speed, not mechanical failure.Milam said Paul Walker survived the impact of the crash, but ""burned to death because of Porsche's defective design.""A federal judge presiding over a similar lawsuit filed by Rodas' estate against Porsche in Los Angeles ruled in favor of the car company on Monday, saying: ""Plaintiff has provided no competent evidence that Rodas' death occurred as a result of any wrongdoing on the part of Defendant.""(Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Sara Catania and Matthew Lewis)"
