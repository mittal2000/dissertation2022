Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-desperate-god_us_5badca6ce4b0bb1705fad807,"In light of the monstrous storm battering the northeast, many have said that the storm is a ""sign of judgment"" from God. We need to ""get right!"", they say.",2012-11-04,"This NOAA satellite image taken Monday, Oct. 29, 2012 shows Hurricane Sandy off the Mid Atlantic coastline moving toward the north with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph. Hurricane Sandy wheeled toward land as forecasters feared Monday, raking cities along the Northeast corridor with rain and wind gusts, flooding shore towns, washing away a section of the Atlantic City Boardwalk, and threatening to cripple Wall Street and New York's subway system with a huge surge of corrosive seawater. (AP Photo/NOAA)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badca6c240000320054bf83.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since entering seminary, the scope and breadth of how I view and understand God has changed a bit. Well, a lot.I sat in my room teary-eyed and wholly upset at God after learning that He regretted making us in Genesis 6:6: ""... and the LORD was sorry that He made humankind on the earth and it grieved Him to His heart."" (NSRV)I knew He destroyed the earth because we (humankind) couldn't get our lives right, but daaaaang. Regret? Sorrowful? We grieved You?Sheesh.Once I got over feeling some kind of way (honestly, that really hurt my feelings!), I began to see that nearly every encounter God had with man in the Old Testament was fueled by His insatiable desire to have a relationship with us. This anthropomorphic God (one with human-like characteristics, feelings, thoughts, interactions) was desperate to have us as His own, be thankful to Him for creating us, and, in whatever way possible, live our lives as He said we should.He, like all ""parents"" do, had a plan for His kids. Our disobedience, however, brought about some of the most discussed, disparaging, and body-of-Christ splitting occurrences in the bible. We see a God who passes judgment on Hebrews and enemies alike for disobedience; God attempts to kill Moses for his disobedience (Exodus 4:18-31) despite God giving him the charge of delivering the Hebrews out of Egypt (clearly, obeying His ordinances was more important than some God-given assignment, eh?) We see God obliterate the Egyptians and their first-born sons for refusing to let His chosen people worship Yahweh as they wanted to -- even going so far to intentionally hardening Pharoah's heart to up the ante and make the punishments for disobedience grow and grow by the day. ""I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them, so that I will gain the glory for myself over Pharaoh and all his army; and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD. And they did so."" (Exodus 14:4)Grimy!In the new dispensation of our faith, grace and mercy rules the coop. Jesus' death and resurrection is the foundation of everything we believe, and in many ways, we have forgotten the vengeance and judgment of God.Jesus makes us feel good. His sermons and parables of fish and salt and lights on a hill are so applicable and practical -- it's like a Publix commercial during the holidays: just makes you want to hug somebody, cook some food, and share it (and the gospel) with good people.But we've forgotten the vengeance and judgment of God.We've forgotten that He's serious about us -- and serious with those who come against us. He desperately wants us, and after millenniums of trying to get us to do right on our own, He sent Jesus to stand in the gap. When God looks at us, He sees us through the blood stained garments of Jesus. He doesn't do what He should to us because Jesus keeps playing ""keep away"" with God!Lest we have forgotten, God is no punk. He's not here to play games on Sunday (or Saturday, if that's your practice). He is cut throat, vengeful, angry, wrathful, and passes judgment at His discretion. Why? Because He's holy and wants us to be holy as well. He wants to have a well-balanced relationship with us that brings pleasure to both parties. He's not down for a one-sided venture to eternity; He wants us to walk with Him.Now wait, does this mean we walk around in all white, sacrificing goats or living like the Old Testament law says? Absolutely not. However, there is something to be said about honoring Him in the most sacred place of all: our hearts.A friend mentioned that he was growing tired of so many preachers presenting no balance to the grace message, sending folks on their way with rose-tinted glasses that God is pleased with our mediocrity and that how we feel rules over God's expectations. Forget yo' feelings: God wants your heart!In light of the monstrous storm battering the northeast, many have said that the storm is a ""sign of judgment"" from God. We need to ""get right!"", they say.I love what Stephen Prothero from CNN's Religion Blog had to say about this ""judgment"":""As for me, I am less sure about what God wills for our storms (political or otherwise). In my view, any God worth worshiping isn't going to be so predictable, or so capricious... When it comes to storms like Sandy, I just don't believe in a God who drowns black babies in Haiti yet refuses to drown out the voices of cranky white men who claim so irreverently to speak in His name.""God isn't some faux wizard behind the smoke and mirrors of the ""Great and Powerful Oz"" using switch levers and buttons controlling this earth... at least I don't think so. We can't say one way or the other if the things that occur in the earth that bring destruction and death are ""God's doing.""What we can say is that He's still desperately seeking for our hearts to turn back to Him and will go at any lengths to get them back.Yes, God passes judgment on us. Yes, He allows the enemy to come in and wreak havoc until we get our minds back on track. Sometimes we recover, sometimes we don't. I am reminded as I go through this seminary experience, though: It's dangerous to teach grace without teaching judgment. Have you ever met a kid that was never punished for anything? They're brats. And the absolute worst.I'm at the place where I'm seeing and learning that God is really desperate for us. He's revealed Himself to us in ways that we can't fathom, given to us in ways we don't deserve. Building relationship with Him is something He wants. His desperation for us exudes from every crevice of this earth.Grace and judgment: what a dynamic duo.On the ""don't-cast-your-judgment-on-me, I'm-working-on-my-relationship-with-you"" Chase,Alisha L."

AFP PHOTO /MIGUEL MEDINA (Photo credit should read MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb19d402100002501c74564.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The current financial crisis makes it very clear that our current financial system is not sustainable. This is the opportune time to re-imagine and re-design it using a new set of objectives. The global financial crisis has demonstrated serious shortcomings with our banking system. It has converted the marketplace into a casino. It's no longer business; it's outright gambling, excessive greed and irresponsible capitalism. It has encouraged irresponsible behaviour among individuals who influence the marketplace. This is where social business comes in. Social business offers ethical guidelines: non-dividend companies that address social goals -- taking care of the basic deficiency of present day version of capitalism.Credit markets were originally created to serve human needs; to provide businesses and individuals with capital to start or expand businesses or fulfill other financial needs. In recent years, however, the credit market has been distorted by a handful of people and companies with a different goal in mind -- to earn unreasonable financial returns through clever feats of financial engineering. With the collapse of the housing market in the United States, this house of cards has fallen. Millions of people around the world, who invested in good faith and played no active part in these dealings, are now suffering. As it is most often, the poor are the ones who must bear the most of the harsh consequences.But the deeper the crisis the bigger the opportunity to correct the mistakes. Present crisis offers us an excellent opportunity to redesign our financial system in a fundamental way. If we miss this opportunity we'll be going the road of repeating the history. Good economic theory must give the people the chance to use their talents to build their own lives. We must get away from the traditional route where the rich will do the business and the poor will depend on private or public charity. In my experience, poor people are the world's greatest entrepreneurs. Every day, they must innovate in order to survive. They remain poor because they do not have the opportunities to turn their creativity into sustainable income.This is where the idea of social business comes in; investors supporting social businesses, which have social missions instead that of maximizing profit. I have witnessed it many times that companies investing in social businesses ultimately benefit from social business by making the world a better place. In the short-run they turn out to be more competitive because of positive effects with regard to the motivation of employees and enhancing innovation potential. What we need is to think strategically about development, analyzing a country's potential role in its region and the world in search of opportunities for growth. Platforms like the Global Social Business Summit can facilitate the process on bringing about change. They offer space to establish connections across industry to build a global network for social business and social investment. I have been promoting and establishing social businesses for many years now to fight poverty and other social problems. I see enormous interest being generated throughout the world on this new way of doing business. Let us move forward to make this change and let us create the world we dream of. It is in our capacity to do so. Prof. Muhammad Yunus is a founding member of The Grameen Creative Lab, which is organizing the Global Social Business Summit.

CLARY/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb35b012100000001c7c68f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Around midnight on October 29, Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, tweeted ""Proud of Twitter right now."" As well he should be. After my New York City apartment lost power around 8 p.m., my smartphone's data plan suddenly became my only connection with the outside world. I could have used any number of online resources to stay informed during Hurricane Sandy but I ended up using Twitter almost exclusively.Twitter's microblogging format, capping tweets at 140 characters, was perfect for this type of situation. For a moment I tried tuning into a local radio station using iHeartRadio's iPhone app but quickly realized that their signal-to-noise-ratio was simply unacceptble. My precious phone battery was being wasted on reporters and meteorologists rambling on and on between important announcements. I needed something that was fast and to the point. Do I have to evacuate? Cool. Did my neighbor's building just collapse? Got it.Twitter offered everything I needed and more. When the power went out, I quickly followed Governor Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) and Mayor Bloomberg (@MikeBloomberg) for the latest announcements. I also followed NY Red Cross (@redcrossny), FEMA (@fema) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (@NOAA) for helpful survival tips and general information. For some comic relief, I even followed Michael Bloomberg's Spanish-speaking alter ego Miguel Bloombito (@ElBloombito).Even though Twitter outshines every other social network during natural disasters, it is still far from perfect. It is too easy for Mr. Internet Troll to start a rumor during a dangerous situation and for 100 Twitter users to retweet it within seconds thinking they are doing everyone else a favor. For example, the man behind the now infamous Twitter handle @ComfortablySmug may be facing criminal charges for having us believe, among other things, that the New York stock exchange was under 3 feet of water when it really wasn't.The only way to protect yourself from untimely lies and misinformation on Twitter is to listen first and foremost to verified accounts and legitimate organizations. Tweets from the community are helpful to get a distributed feel of the situation but they have to be taken with a grain (a byte?) of salt. The truth always swims to the surface on Twitter, but the social network's self-correcting mechanism may not be fast enough during a crisis. Even with these flaws, however, I'm still amazed by the way Twitter helped me and my family during Hurricane Sandy. Famous investor Peter Thiel once said: ""We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters."" I used to agree with Mr. Thiel. I would get a kick out of poking fun at the Groupon clones and the Instagram wannabes for not doing anything meaningful for society. As I'm typing this by blog post by candlelight, waiting for ConEd to restore my power, I realize that Mr. Thiel is wrong in using Twitter as the poster boy for the basket-weaving startups. Twitter is completely different. Whether you are organizing a protest, reading up on industry news or simply trying to stay alive during a hurricane, Twitter has become the new normal for modern society."

This is back-page news for most people, but it should be seen as the canary-in-a-coal-mine moment for a coming final ideological assault on the American social compact and civic values that most of us share. A nano-percentage of the federal budget these agendas may be, but the arts and humanities have long been seen as targets of opportunity in the values and choice wars of the past 30 years, easy red flags to wave in the mugs of talk radio hosts, convenient distractions while the more serious business of women's and minority rights and freedoms are flanked by increasingly sophisticated (and deadly serious) political forces.Well over a year ago, I was asked to add my voice to the useful noise of HuffPost bloggers. At the time I said yes, but then decided I was a reader first, an opinionator second, and that my voice could wait while I absorbed the contributions around me.That said, and with the highly vocal exception of Kennedy Center chief Michael Kaiser, I have watched the traffic come and go by only to learn that the arts (and/or the humanities and other members of the immediate family) are to the national debate and coming election as Route 66 is to the busy U.S. interstate highway system -- a wind-blown vestige of a past national mythology that, like the anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis, finds its roots in the Kennedy administration, and later and deeper in that of LBJ.Enough of the cultural silent majority.The federal budget, however large or small, represents the social contract of the shared values and strategies by which we settle down together, negotiate the differences among us, vote up or down those who can improve or refine it, and ultimately maps the path we are following to arrive at our next developmental cusp of community-building. That map is Ground Zero for the border wars between Right and Left, the coveted terrain to be captured in each and every national election, and then sliced, diced and gerrymandered to the ideologues who win.I run The Yard, a 40-year-old artist residency and performance center devoted to contemporary dance and related performing arts on Martha's Vineyard that has nurtured myriad important American artists in the pursuit of their imaginative goals. During The Yard's summer season, one of my favorite places to grab a breakfast is the Art Cliff Diner in Vineyard Haven. I like it so much that last summer I decided to add an Art Cliff baseball cap to my usual order. I ate, I left, and I tossed the cap onto the dash of my car as I headed up-island to work. Perhaps because my day job is fine arts, I counter-intuitively follow macroeconomic news and its battlefield reporting the way some people follow sports. As my gaze drifted over the ball cap, I momentarily imagined there a logo for the fiscal cliff rather than the local diner, notable as much for the fact that my glance had eliminated the word ""art"" entirely as that it had replaced it with budgetary Armageddon. What's real is the arts and their peers are well on their way to Armageddon no matter what may take place on or in lieu of the fiscal cliff coming to a government near you in early 2013. There is a lot more to say here, and I plan to continue to do so as the election approaches and its aftermath settles in. But all of us, whether artist or non-artist, parent, child, teacher, health care provider or city planner, know that we live day-to-day in a shared culture, with the arts and artists among our most useful, adaptable tools and civic problem-solvers, editorialists and educators. Know this: Your, our, vote is the only defense of last resort that we have to protect that fragile ecosystem of negotiated values and common landscape, and maneuver around the Art Cliff to the next critical front in the 30-years-war. Come November 6 (or sooner where early voting is possible), don't you forget it!"

This year's race puts Romney supporters Stacey Dash and Lindsay Lohan against Obama's Honey Boo Boo, Lena Dunham... and most of Hollywood. But a recent pro-Obama essay from Arcade Fire's Win Butler may be our favorite celebrity endorsement yet, both for its thoughtful point of view and shout out to Canada. Butler, an American living in Montreal, wrote an essay for novelist Dave Egger's Obama endorsement blog 90 Days, 90 Reasons, focusing on the POTUS' communication skills, which Canadians apparently appreciate: ""I am excited for four more years of an Obama presidency for many reasons, but the one I am going to write about is selfish: I want four more sweet years of Canadians liking Americans. The Republicans will try to convince America that President Obama being a good communicator is somehow a bad thing. Often times politicians act as if the only use of public speaking is trying to get elected. In fact, this kind of personal charisma is perhaps the most direct way a president can pursue America’s interests abroad. Being able to communicate in a compelling way, and engaging other countries as partners and adults, is in America’s best interest.""Butler goes on to contrast Romney's gaffe during the London Olympics -- the one that briefly made the special relationship less special -- to Obama's smooth speech to the United Nations advocating America's vision for the world. We try not to put too much weight on celeb endorsements but Butler really appeals to the Canadaphile in all of us.

""This is my fiance,"" said Vahaba, 31, who had tears running down her face as she stood in Central Park where the race would have ended, just moments after Martin O'Donoghue had proposed. No official marathon was held this weekend as a result of Hurricane Sandy, but many runners had gathered in Central Park to stand and take pictures. Some even ran around the park anyway. O'Donoghue said he coordinated his proposal in advance of the weekend, and that he was all set to propose on Sunday. ""I'd talked to the organizers,"" O'Donoghue said. The plan was to have a sign for Vahaba that said, 'If you finish in five and a half hours, I'll marry you.' If she was behind on that pace, O'Donoghue said that he was going to have a magic marker handy to continue crossing the time out and altering it for whenever she did finish. Once the race was cancelled, O'Donoghue decided to bring Vahaba's friends and family to the 26.2 mile mark anyway.""I just basically said, 'Look, let's go to the finish line and do it,"" said O'Donoghue.

Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/your-own-personal-guides_us_5b9c745de4b03a1dcc7ecb66,"Throughout the country, including in Tokyo, there are local associations of what are often called Goodwill Guides, most typically retired long-time residents who speak some English and welcome an opportunity to use it.",2012-11-03,"Tokyo Goodwill Guide Hiroshi Ashikari at Senso-ji Temple, Asakusa",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c745a26000036007f7c04.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"When my wife and I traveled with a friend to Japan in 2007, we engaged an excellent guide to help us make sense of Kyoto's temples and gardens (I wrote about the experience in The Washington Post, where I gave a grateful nod to Chris Rowthorn, whose business arranged it). The success of this approach taught us something we hadn't previously figured out: that local guides can enhance a visit, especially when an unfamiliar language stands as a barrier between you and comprehension.Our most recent trip, in October 2012, took us further afield: After several days in Tokyo we took the train north-west and visited towns and cities such as Inuyama (which rejoices in a very active City Councilman born in Brooklyn), Takayama, Ainokura (a village featuring traditional gassho-style architecture) and dynamic Kanazawa. To have hired professional guides in all these places would have become expensive, and while we did this on occasion we also tried a system that is so helpful and so well developed in Japan that I'm surprised not every traveler is aware of it: volunteer guides. Throughout the country, including in Tokyo, there are local associations of what are often called Goodwill Guides, most typically retired long-time residents who speak some English and welcome an opportunity to use it (other languages are sometimes also spoken: one of our guides told us he had German and Chinese plus enough Korean to be of help to visitors). There is no charge for their services, but the traveler is expected to pay all admission fees and bus or taxi fares and treat the guide to lunch/drinks/snacks. (In the event, most of our guides had retiree transport passes and were entitled to free admission to museums and other sites.) Finding these local groups is easy, because they are bound together through the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO), which maintains a central website providing full contact information: http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/travel/guide/list_volunteerGuides_a-n.html. (But note that our goodwill guide in Takayama was arranged not through the JNTO site but through this Web link: http://www.hida.jp/english/practical-guide/introducing-our-free-english-tourist-guide-service.)The JNTO list is arranged by prefecture, so you'll need to know which one is home to your destination. To learn this, I simply did a Web search for the name of a town; sites like Wikipedia always give that information. Then I e-mailed the relevant Goodwill Guide association (only once did I need to follow up a second time) and made my request. As a rule, the guides themselves got back to me and we set up meeting times and tentative itineraries, based on our preferences and enhanced by the first-hand knowledge of the guides. We'd meet at a central point such as the railway station or at our hotel (I sent a photo of Jackie and me, but often we were the only westerners in sight), and head off on a day or half day of exploration.It all worked well, both logistically and touristically. If you are a fusspot, you might be annoyed that some Goodwill Guides' English is not entirely fluent or that, as 80 year olds, one or two of them don't walk as fast as you do (but note that the pace outside Tokyo is rather leisurely to begin with). If you expect professional-level historical or architectural exegesis, you could be disappointed (though you might not be: these are well-informed people). Indeed, on one occasion we did spend the afternoon with an Anglophone university professor for a more in-depth historical view of old Kanazawa.But for Jackie and me, every encounter with a Goodwill Guide was a happy one. Each was an opportunity to see places we might not have thought to see -- and through local eyes. Each provided a chance to pass several hours with a Japanese man or woman, learn a little about someone's life, share a beer or a bowl of noodles and make a new friend, at least fleetingly. This is a great system. If you are on a tight budget, the advantages are obvious. Even if you're not, you should certainly give it a try."

It's probably because there is so much at stake.,2012-11-03,Young with their backs turned after having an argument isolated on white background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c79d01f00002c00213bb7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Gallup poll conducted for Match.com found that 57 percent would marry someone with considerably different political beliefs. Apparently, having different political views is not necessarily a marital deal breaker. But as a marriage therapist for thirty years, I'm here to tell you that bipartisan marriages are not for the faint of heart. Trust me. I know first hand.  I don't know about you, but I will be one happy camper when this election is over. It's not that I don't appreciate lively, heated debates or the rollercoaster-like effect of the unpredictable twist and turns in the polls or even the fact that politics has pre-empted any chance of simply casual, non-partisan conversation with friends. No, that's the stuff we're supposed to be doing a few days prior what could be one of history's most important elections. That's not my problem.  My problem is this -- there are four people in my family: my husband, my 32-year-old daughter, 27-year-old son and me, and we are a bipartisan family. (In some ways, there is no point in voting because our votes cancel each other out. One boy and one girl on each team. Just kidding, I'll vote.) To make matters worse, we're all competitive, opinionated and passionate about our views. Suffice it to say, this has made for many animated conversations over family dinners. We usually manage to keep things in check and finish our meal on speaking terms, and believe me, that is no small feat.  However, this upcoming election has brought out the worst in my husband and me. It's probably because there is so much at stake. Although I have tolerated our differences fairly well in the past, an opposing viewpoint on these candidates, about these issues, at this time feels simply untenable. Doesn't he know better? And it would be one thing if we could escape the political rhetoric and not be reminded of our differences. But if you're a living, breathing organism who reads papers, watches occasional television or even just walks your dog and bumps into a neighbor, political discourse is simply unavoidable.   I've already ascertained that we would do much better if we developed a sense of humor about ourselves or our political positions a la Carville-Matalin style. As you probably know, James Carville is an advisor to the Democratic Party and Mary Matalin is a former assistant to President George W. Bush and counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney -- unlikely bedfellows, no doubt. I heard them speak at the Builders' Convention one time and marveled at their ability to laugh at each other. Mary Matalin told the story about an appearance on television that, because of their highly polarized points of view, left them feeling edgy towards each other. They went out to dinner with their two young daughters, one of whom was misbehaving at the restaurant. Mary asked her daughter to try to be good and the girl replied, ""For a dollar I will,"" and after a few quiet moments Mary responded, ""Why can't you be good for nothing... like your father?"" Their laughter was inspirational. Certainly, if a advisor to the democratic party can live, love, make love and laugh with a close colleague of Bush and Cheney, why do my husband and I have to take things so personally? Why has it been so hard to just agree to disagree?  I know we're not alone. Undoubtedly, other people's emotions are at a pitch. No one seems to be lukewarm about this election, the issues or the candidates. I envy friends whose marriages aren't challenged by differing political views. ""Must be great,"" I tell myself, to anticipate celebrating together on November 6th or licking each other's wounds. In my house, one person's victory will be another person's loss. And regardless of whose candidate loses, I have a feeling neither of us will let the other hear the end of it for quite some time. Apparently, walking down the aisle is a whole lot easier that reaching across it.To learn more about Michele and her Divorce Busting practice, visit her on the web at:Website: http://www.divorcebusting.com Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/DivorceBusting Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/DivorceBusting YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/DivorceBusting"

Under most circumstances, this simple word conjures up thoughts of coasts, oceans and abundant sunshine. But for nearly 50 million people, Sandy has been damp and dark. Mother nature has left many of us feeling as powerless and damaged as our external world. But as we mop up the mess, we ought to survey our internal landscape with as much concern. Just like the dangling crane in midtown Manhattan, your emotional well-being hinges on it. The Four Essentials in Your Post-Sandy Disaster Relief Kit: 1. Resilience:  Your ability to bounce back is a critical factor in helping you cope with the calamity of Sandy. Resilience, defined by the American Psychological Association as ""the process of adapting well in the face of adversity,"" has been shown to have a protective effect on your health and well-being. In one study, resiliency was the key to recuperation. It has been the common thread amongst people who successfully survived the emotional stress of Thailand's tsunami and Japan's earthquake. But unlike the tragic headlines of catastrophic natural disasters, the news on resiliency is more heartening: It is a human trait that can be strengthened over time. And preliminary research suggests a link between meditation and the areas of the brain associated with resiliency. Though now might feel like an overwhelming and challenging time to sit in stillness, getting into your ""om zone"" could offer just the refuge you seek. 2. Optimism:  Finding the silver lining to Sandy's visit may seem virtually impossible as you pick up the literal pieces of your life, but an attitude of optimism can profoundly affect your sense of well-being, and in some cases, prolong your life. In a group of people with heart disease, optimism was the single best predictor of longevity, irrespective of any other factor. If an optimistic attitude can lengthen the years of life to those with physiologically weakened hearts, might it also confer a benefit to those of us with emotionally weakened hearts? When it comes to optimism, a positive attitude firmly rooted in reality takes precedence over the unbridled variety. And though cultivating a mental dialogue of positivity is a life's work, optimism (like resiliency) can be learned. 3. Social support: No man is an island, or in this tragic case -- lower Manhattan. Natural disasters are mother nature's painful yet powerful reminder of just how interconnected we truly are. And the science supports the health benefits of social interconnectedness. Strong social relationships have also been linked to longer lifespan. So heed the call of our wise elders John, Paul, George and Ringo... Try to get by with a little help from your friends. Your tribe may be the key ingredient to your emotional recovery.4. Stress reduction:  Stress is inevitable. It is your body's way of keeping you safe. Stress kept you off the streets and indoors during the superstorm. Stress prompted the authorities to evacuate entire communities and shut down public transport. But what now? The skies are sunny, yet our internal meteorologist is still on high alert. The aftermath of acute stress can take a toll on your health. It can increase your risk for a heart attack by 21-fold, and in some cases can literally break your heart. There is no better time to manage your stress than now. By getting a better handle on your stress you won't necessarily change the elements, but you will give yourself a metaphorical raincoat to face the storm that's raging within.  It might take weeks, even months, for many communities to recover from Sandy. But if we are to mend our outer world, we must also mend our hearts. As Gandhi famously said, ""We must first become the change we wish to see in our world."" Let's be the change.For more by Aditi Nerurkar, M.D., click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

You've got the ring. What you didn't realize is that along with that gorgeous man and ring comes his mother...your future mother-in-law. Sounds cool, right? WRONG! Your future mother-in-law is not the one who keeps her distance and asks, ""How high?"" when you say, ""Jump"". She's the one that movies are made of. We've all heard the horror stories. The mother-in-law whose sole mission is to break her son and his fiancée up. Aside from disagreeing with every decision the bride makes when it comes to the wedding, she's constantly offering up unwanted advice -- from how to spend their money to the type of career the bride should have. Putting the son in an awkward position, he's going to feel torn between defending his mother who gave birth to him and his future wife. I had a bride a few years ago who decided to wage World War III against her future mother-in-law just a few months before the wedding. She felt that she meddled too much and now was the time to take a stand and fight back. She stopped speaking to her whenever they were in the same room. She would walk into the room and her mother-in-law would walk out. It became a competition for the son's attention and support and not about the wedding or the couple. Needless to say, the result was a lot of unnecessary drama and stress between not only the bride and her fiancé's mother but her fiancé as well. Don't let his mother coerce you into playing games. Someone has to be the adult in the situation and at the end of the day, all you can do is control your own actions. Here are some necessary steps to take when it comes to dealing with your future meddling mother-in-law and to ensure that you two begin your new lives happily: First thing's first: Make sure that you and your fiancé are on the same page. I promise, this whole process will be so much easier if you approach it as a team and not alone. Second on the list: Set your boundaries! Now that you and your fiancé are on the same page, you'll need to consult about your desired boundaries and how to lay them down. Now is not the time to be petty. You can't really stop her from giving unwanted advice but you can ask her to call before she comes over. Also, make sure that your fiancé is the ""Boundary Setter"". She'll be more receptive to change if it comes from her son and not you. The final step is: Acceptance. Listen up honey, your mother-in-law isn't going anywhere. Waging war against her will only cause heartache for your husband-to-be, which ultimately trickles down into your marriage. It will be much more fun planning the next 25 wonderful years with your husband rather than doing 25 to life with your mother-in-law.It's about the journey, not the destination...make it a good one!"

That said, any automotive aspects of note in the campaign are fair game. While the talking heads may debate whether or not the auto bailouts worked, or if the government should sell its stake in General Motors, we see fit to analyze a far more pressing concern in the eyes of the voting public, and that's the candidate's choice of cars!Seeing as the incumbent's daily driver for the last four years has been a GMT800 SUV chassis made to look like a Cadillac limo, it seems to us that we might get a little more mileage looking at the vehicle's owned by the challenger Mitt Romney. In case you didn't know, the man has a decent collection of cars, and to manage said collection, has a car elevator, which allows for a two-story garage. With a vehicular elevator like that, one could conceal many-a-station wagon, so we decided to do a little automotive fact-checking of our own. With that in mind, let's look at the challenger's rides.Rom-ni-fact #1: Mitt Romney's father was CEO of American Motors Corporation, and oversaw the merger of Nash and Hudson to create AMC... It should be noted that none of these car companies exist today.Chevrolet Silverado Crew Cab:Jeez, talk about speaking to your base. Nothing says ""AMERICA!"" and ""Drill baby Drill!"" like a Chevy pickup, with an average fuel economy in the high teens. We can overlook that a certain portion of these trucks we're built in Canada and Mexico. I'll say it again for posterity: ""AMERICA!!!""1996 Saab 9000 Turbo:General Motors held a significant stake in Saab as early as 1989. So the 9000 would be a foreign car, but with American influences. How diplomatic.Rom-ni-fact #2: Mitt Romney can apparently pass the ""square foot test."" Show him a square foot of any car and he can tell you what it is. It should be a debate question for both candidates next week.Nothing says 'heartland of America' like a good ole' Mustang. Whether he actually enjoys driving it or not, the choice is a smart play. Although, as Abraham Lincoln once said, ""You can please some of the people all the time, and please all the people some of the time, but you can never win over a GM Performance enthusiast while driving a 'Stang."" He said that. It's science.Cadillac SRX (2007 and 2010):This duo of Caddy crossovers are driven by Mitt's wife, and are well-thought-out choices. They endorse the American auto industry, while showing support for families. As the first-ever Cadillac crossovers, they also display a vision towards the future. A future that may be filled with picking kids up from soccer practice.Nash Rambler (1962 and 1963):The '63 Rambler was apparently Mitt's first car. On his 60th birthday in 2007 (Rom-ni-fact #4: Mitt Romney 65 years-old), his son Tagg (No, really) presented the presidential hopeful with a sharp '62 Rambler Convertible. No one can argue with the swagger of any man driving a drop-top Rambler. Swaggg for days...Chevrolet Caprice Station Wagon:The car most synonymous with the Romney family is their old Chevrolet Caprice Wagon. In 1983, the Romney family set out on a family vacation from their Belmont, MA home to Ontario, CA. As they embarked, they left the trusty family dog Seamus in his carry cage on top of the wagon... for 12 hours. Though no harm befell the canine, the story received national attention. Also, wood paneling rocks!Phantom Park: Okay, so not necessarily an automobile, but it does move, and when there is a car on it, the Phantom Park car elevator has four wheels! As part of a renovation to his $12 million La Jolla, CA beach home, a four-car garage was installed in the basement. The 3,600 square foot facility included this feature to make more room for vehicles in the split level garage. According to a Forbes report, the elevator runs on average, $55,000.Cadillac Escalade:According to bornrich.com, Romney owns a customized Escalade. Little is known about this particular vehicle, as bornrich.com highlighted standard features on an Escalade, such as the 6.2L V8 engine, and 14-way power seats. Moving forward, that website may want to stick to reporting on mansions, and we'll refrain from writing stories on yachts.Dodge Pickup (year unknown):This year, Romney held a campaign rally at Ford Field. In an almost entirely empty stadium he talked about how much he loved American cars. Among the cars mentioned were his Rambler, his wife's Cadillacs and an old Dodge pickup that he owned. Sure, he mentioned a For there somewhere, but he talked about all of the Big Three Detroit automakers... at Ford Field. We'll reserve judgement on that maneuver.1985 BMW (model unknown):We were really against putting any specific car that we could not confirm on this. We had received multiple reports that Romney's FAVORITE ride was his 1985 BMW, but we could not get a read on the model. This seems a likely choice though. A well-built executive's performance sedan at a time when he would have been in his early years at Bain Capital. Nothing says success like the original BMW Motorsport car. It may not be American, but it's the car-lovers choice, indeed.So if you are the type to decide on a president based on their choice in vehicle, you can now consider yourself an informed voter. Depending on how much of a gearhead you are, you may you use the information gained here to place your vote in the coming election! (Rom-ni-fact #5: Mitt Romney is running for president.)"

New York suffered a direct hit, with the city's mass transit system flooded and part-paralyzed for days to come.But there is good news, too, and that is all that it failed to do. Sandy did not kill hundreds -- as Hurricane Katrina did in New Orleans in 2005 -- thanks, in part, to timely evacuations and rescue efforts. And luckily, it did not trigger an even greater disaster at one of the region's nuclear power plants. But it could have.Watchdog groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) warn that America's nuclear facilities remain vulnerable to a variety of potential catastrophic events, both natural and resulting from deliberate sabotage or cyber-attack. And they say that federal regulations are currently inadequate to deal with all of these possible disaster scenarios.I reported on one such danger, solar flares, last May in the New York Daily News. A 2011 study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory warns that a massive solar storm could knock out electricity in some areas for weeks, overwhelming the capacity of many nuclear plants to keep their critical cooling systems operational.But nuclear regulators have not required power plants to guard against the risk of solar storms. David Lochbaum, the director of UCS's nuclear safety project told me in an email interview that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses plants ""using the rearview mirror."" It looks to the past, in other words, to assess future risks.But, he says, past events are not always a good measure for the worst that can happen. Lochbaum cites Fukushima. The Daichi plant was located behind a seawall that was high enough to protect against the kind of flooding that Japan had seen previously. But nobody had considered the possibility that a monster tsunami could breach the wall.All 13 of the plant's back-up generators broke down an hour after the earthquake when they were swamped by the tsunami. As a result, that critical cooling system failed.""Is it prudent public policy to operate facilities of such immense hazard on such tenuous assumptions?"" Lochbaum asks. He says that Hurricane Sandy provides further proof that we need to come up with solutions ""sooner rather than later"" to fix America's inadequate regulatory system.Lochbaum points out in a blog that the risks of nuclear power generation are magnified by the fact that the plants are always located near a river, lake or ocean. That is because producing nuclear power creates a lot of heat, which needs to be dissipated by huge volumes of water. These cooling systems are all that prevents the plutonium in reactor cores from going critical and melting down, much like what happened at Fukushima.But locating nuclear plants near bodies of water has its risks, which range from the clogging of intake pipes by barnacles and mussels -- as happened at the Pilgrim nuclear plant near Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1981 -- to potential damage from storm surges, such as those created by Hurricane Sandy.One facility was put in a state of ""high alert"" during Sandy due to high-water levels in its water intake structure. The Oyster Creek Generating Station on Barnegat Bay -- 40 miles north of Atlantic City, and the oldest nuclear facility in the nation -- was shut down last week for refueling. Plutonium, however, can dangerously overheat whether or not a plant is actively producing electricity. So, 300 employees stayed at Oyster Creek, Monday night, to ensure that the imperiled cooling system continued to function.Nuclear plants located near oceans are not the only ones threatened by flooding. Thirty-four reactors, fully a third of those in the U.S.9i, are sited along rivers with dams upstream. A report released last March by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission suggests that many of these plants were not designed to withstand the massive floods that catastrophic dam collapse would unleash. The Huffington Post reported earlier this month that:""According to the NRC's own calculations ... the odds of the dam near the Oconee plant [operated by Duke Energy in South Carolina] failing at some point over the next 22 years are far higher than were the odds of an earthquake-induced tsunami causing a meltdown at the Fukushima plant.""This alarming news, however, was blacked out of the NRC's public report. It was leaked by the lead author, Richard H Perkins, who said that his work had been censored because it revealed that:""The NRC has been in possession of relevant, notable, and derogatory safety information for an extended period but failed to properly act on it.""In another section of the report, about the Fort Calhoun nuclear plant in Nebraska, NRC redactors removed information indicating that the failure of the Oahe or Fort Randall dams could result in levels of rampaging water higher than the plant's flood protection walls. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission evidently believes that it is better to hide the facts about nuclear risks than to fix the problem.Critics allege that not only does the NRC withhold critical information, but also fails in many cases to enforce regulations that are already on the books. David Lochbaum warns:""I'm most concerned about the NRC's practice of allowing unsafe reactors to operate. UCS's Nuclear Power Information Tracker shows 47 reactors that NRC knows to violate fire protection regulations and 27 reactors with seismic protection known to be less than the seismic hazards they face. These pre-existing vulnerabilities mean that the American public is protected more by luck than by skill.""And if superstorm Sandy, and the increasing frequency of other extreme weather events in recent years is any evidence, America's luck may be running out.This article first appeared in the Guardian, UK"

Who could have predicted that a superstorm would overshadow and scramble the presidential campaign in its final days? President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney revised and re-revised their campaign schedules as Hurricane Sandy, a most unlikely October surprise, barreled up the East Coast and then roared ashore in New Jersey.

Just like with Hurricane Irene, there will be some GDP growth from Sandy -- spikes in consumption as people stock up on batteries, food supplies, water, etc., and spikes in construction work after the hurricane. This growth will be countered by the loss in productivity and output. Overall, analysts are predicting that the positives and negatives will largely cancel each other out and there will be little impact on GDP.Looking deeper, though, it becomes clear that the positives and negatives of a hurricane don't cancel each other out. For one, GDP counts the growth from rebuilding efforts but does not count the negative of physical destruction. So, the economic activity generated by rebuilding your house will count but the negative impact of losing your house is not counted. Analysts also see rapid recovery for New York City because much of the city's economy is knowledge based but what about the areas of the economy that are not knowledge-based?If fact, the impact of the hurricane on the city exposes another flaw of GPD -- the inability to account for inequality. The wealth divide in the city is the highest it's been in a decade. The wealthiest 20 percent of Manhattan residents made an average of more than $390,000 last year. The poorest 20 percent made $9,681. During the hurricane, those with a car could leave the city and those without were stuck.The forced evacuation of some parts of the city further highlights the wealth gap. Residents forced to evacuate went either to shelters or other homes. Those that could afford to do so moved into hotels -- the same hotels that are staffed by individuals on the other end of the wealth spectrum that came to work despite the weather conditions. The workforce that keeps the city's hotels, restaurants, and bars open also came to work because they have far less access to paid time off and are often the least able to afford missing a paycheck, even if it means working during a hurricane.None of this inequality will be reflected in the GDP numbers. None of the discussion around the economic impact will focus on the impact to low-wage, economically insecure workers. Are we making progress if positive economic growth is comprised of people buying more batteries and more construction work is done to rebuild houses, while we do not reflect the impact of losing a home or living in an economy where workers risk losing their job or paycheck unless they find a way to get to work in a hurricane?Catastrophic events like Hurricane Sandy show us that we need to start measuring what matters -- quality of life, not just the narrow focus of GDP.Cross-posted with PolicyShop.net"

I have been able to explore extensively with Windows 8 on an Intel prototype touchscreen Ultrabook for about four months now, including using it exclusively a couple of times for travel, video production and writing. What has driven my opinions the most is game developing for the operating system (see my six weeks of video, documenting our development process as part of the Ultimate Coder experience. We came in second place). So what do I think of Windows 8? I have been asked this question repeatedly in the last week due to the official Microsoft release. I have tried to summarize my thoughts here.As a long time hardcore windows user (many years of teaching new systems to users from the original Win 3 to the current Windows 8) and being a tech evangelist and proponent for the everyday user) I would have to say I really like the new interface. That said I am convinced that we are stuck in an in-between UX (user experience) state. One world is that of the classic desktop PC experience and the other is the world of touch. The other realization I had is that my own habits as well as others are more dependent on cloud computing than installed software.Right away I modified the Windows 8 touch platform interface to suit my cloud intensive habits (for most of my everyday tasks I use almost all cloud based tools like Dropbox, Google Tools, Skype and Basecamp just to name a few. This took a little tweaking, but after awhile it was able to get it just right. The screen navigation really impresses me. Swiping from the side bezel to activate thumb navigation tools and multiple screen access by large swiping the screen from bezel left became second nature after a few tries.What I noticed immediately was that I had to force myself to not default back to the desktop to navigate. Many standard everyday tools like Snip It and Task Manager are still grounded in the classic desktop UX. This I believe is key to how well the general windows user will adopt the new system. It forces the user to leap out of the touch centrc interface and break back into desktop mode. At least Windows RT solves some of this disjointedness. Microsoft had hinted at a revolutionary break from the start menu and desktop starting with Windows Vista. Like many attempts to break old habits, users I have interacted with refuse change and quickly go back to what is familiar and comfortable.Now let me dive into a bit of theory here. Apple has built OSX and iOS with the idea that the two will share certian UX elements. Thye have not gone as far as Windows by merging the two. They did this on purpose from the beginning. My theory is that they will not expose the full breadth of the iOS brilliance within the OSX until they have the multi-touch interface fully developed even for the enterprise user. Now let's go back to Windows. I think they are on to something incredible here. Windows 8 will bring them up to speed with iOS on devices like the Surface with Windows RT. But where I think they error is introducing the interface to the world way before that world is ready to leave what they have fallen so habitually comfortable with, the clunkiness of a desktop and start menu centric interface.I may be wrong. We will soon find out. Now this is not a leap totally in the wrong direction. Windows RT and the introduction of devices like the new Surface will allow us to see how far the touch interface of Windows 8 can go both in the marketplace and as a consumer centric operating system. For the meantime I think most users will be confused.Last, seeing that the Surface Touch Cover and Type Cover both have a trackpad really threw me into a frustration. Why is Microsoft going this direction. It is my theory that as UX innovation continues the use of the mouse will disappear. Is touch the end all user interface? No, absolutely not. But until our our eye can be used to intuitively choose and select the smallest area in an interface, touch will continue to be the best choice for a tablet experience. And let me be very clear. The mouse and keyboard are nowhere near being dead. I still believe we have intensive uses where the pc will far outwork the tablet. But then there are uses where the tablet sans the mouse and keyboard is a far superior experience. Seeing the trackpad on a Surface Cover has only confirmed that Microsoft is not ready to break from the desktop experience. Personally when I am at my desk I want every possible interface available to me. But when I go to any tablet experience I want to be mouseless and keyboardless. Call me a reductionist. I believe the consumer is just still most wanting a desktop experience and a tablet experience, independent of the other."
