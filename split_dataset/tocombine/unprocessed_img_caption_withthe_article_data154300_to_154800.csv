With patience, we're in the driver's seat of our own lives.",2013-05-20,"Young man at the Isar river, Munich, Bavaria, Germany",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d28be1f0000510021803e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's been 10 years since I wrote my book The Power of Patience. As I revised it recently in preparation for its release in paperback, I was struck by how impossibly more speeded up we've gotten in the past decade. Meyer Friedman, the creator of the concept of the type-A personality, calls it ""hurry sickness."" Witness my 16-year-old and her friends who can't even listen to the whole of a three-minute song -- even one they profess to love. Music, Facebook, texts -- they touch in for a moment, then move on because they might be missing something otherwise.Then there's me. I'm just as hyped up as ever -- or perhaps more. Everything is urgent now -- clients expect an instant response, traffic is worse and so I'm frantically trying not to be late, I must say yes to every opportunity because another may not arrive.I know better. I know that the capacity for patience -- that blend of stick-to- it-ness and ability to tolerate delay calmly -- is a must-have quality that not only contributes to our sense of well-being, but is the foundation of success at home and at work. Patience helps us create space between impulse and action, which allows us to respond to challenging people and situations wisely. It allows us to hang in there and keep going, whether with a person or with a process. It keeps us out of fight-or-flight, so we have access to the executive and intelligent part of our brains rather than just responding from our limbic systems, where our thinking is more primitive. Plus, the more we keep the fight-or-flight stress response off, the fewer stress-related health issues -- like high blood pressure, chest pains, muscle aches, autoimmune diseases -- we will likely suffer from.I know all this, and yet I continually get caught up in a sense of emergency, which is the antithesis of patience: must do now or will die! In this state, every tiny obstacle becomes a mountain of a problem, every person an irritant to be done with so I can move onto something more important.They say awareness is the first step of change, and re-reading my own book made me aware of just how far away I'd gotten from the practices that keep me centered no matter what is going on around me. There are many, but there's one that helps me the most. Perhaps it will help you, too. I say ""I have all the time I need"" to myself as soon as I become aware that I've flopped over into impatience. It works like magic. I instantly calm down and from this more patient place, manage to actually do all I need to do. It even works for me in traffic -- I find I'm never actually late and if I were to be, at least I wouldn't be a stressed-out wreck when I arrive. We don't have to be victims of hurry sickness. We do have all the time we need -- and from this patient mind zone, we can reclaim our time, our priorities and our ability to respond well to life and all its demands. With patience, we're in the driver's seat of our own lives.For more by M.J. Ryan, click here.For more on stress, click here."

3,WELLNESS,5 Things Angelina Jolie Teaches Us About Cancer,"Joy Huber, Contributor
Author of 'Cancer with Joy'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/angelina-jolie-mastectomy_us_5b9d2d25e4b03a1dcc853362,"As more details have been revealed, I have reflected on what one of the world's most beautiful and most recognizable women has taught us recently about cancer.",2013-05-20,"LONDON, ENGLAND - APRIL 11: Angelina Jolie attends the G8 summit at Lancaster House on April 11, 2013 in London, England. (Photo by Danny Martindale/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2d252100003300c569eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This past week, I, along with many many others, was quite frankly shocked to hear the breaking news that Angelina Jolie had a preventive double mastectomy upon finding (quoted from her op-ed): ""I carry a 'faulty' gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer.""As more details have been revealed, I have reflected on what one of the world's most beautiful and most recognizable women has taught us recently about cancer. 1. It can happen to anyone.  Truly no one is immune to the big c; cancer just doesn't care how old, young, rich, or poor you are. It strikes celebrities, and people just like you and me. 2. It impacts all of us. I hear repeatedly the statistic that one in two men and one in three women will face cancer in their life. If it's not impacting you today, it will at some point. I certainly don't share this to strike fear in you. This is simply reality. 3. Looking at the previous two, I say with confidence we all want to prevent it. Just like Angelina so wanted to prevent or at least greatly reduce her risk, I believe we're all interested in how we can prevent cancer. But the question that needs to be raised is, Are we committed to preventing cancer? Here I think not. For if you are interested in something you'll do it when it's convenient I've heard, and if you're committed to something, you'll do it. Period. A quote I love! We all do things every day that we know raise our risk of cancer (smoking, poor diet, and lack of exercise, to name just a few!). If you are interested in (and committed to!) learning more about how to prevent breast cancer, please check out this resource.If you are wondering like so many whether you'll face breast cancer some day I came across this interesting tool that says it is ""an interactive tool to help estimate a woman's risk of developing breast cancer."" This is from the National Cancer Institute.Also, months before Jolie's news this press release was published stating ""three federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have issued a set of FAQs clarifying BRCA testing as a preventive service under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Importantly, this clarification will allow for BRCA testing to be completed with no patient cost sharing for all non-grandfathered private insurance plans when an asymptomatic woman has a qualifying family history."" Another reason to cheer health reform! 4. Support from family and friends during the cancer journey is critical. Angelina's article says, ""I am fortunate to have a partner, Brad Pitt, who is so loving and supportive. So to anyone who has a wife or girlfriend going through this, know that you are a very important part of the transition."" Those fighting cancer and those supporting them can receive free 1:1 cancer support here.  This is another helpful resource I share for young cancer spouses. 5. Finally, finding joy in the journey is essential!  Whether you are at stage 1 or stage 4 cancer, all cancers are shocking and terrifying. No one feels joy at diagnosis as I know first-hand from being diagnosed Wednesday, March 24th, 2010. Yet in the paragraph where Angelina talks about Brad, she says, ""We managed to find moments to laugh together."" I'm not sure Angelina would have ever had to disclose what she chose to share. What do you think -- she could have kept the secret, right? But, because of her being so willing to share something publicly that's so extremely personal, she has certainly taught many around the world so very much about cancer.Do you think it's helpful to find joy and laugh where you can during the cancer journey? What can it hurt? I wholeheartedly believe it can and does help! This is why our theme at ""Cancer with JOY"" is, ""No one is happy they have cancer! But you can have cancer and still be happy!"" I have begun sharing a ""Daily Dose of Joy"" via Facebook and Twitter. As I said when I announced it, the ""Daily Dose of JOY"" will bring ""Do's & Don'ts, #cancerresources, #cancernews, #cancersupport, jokes and MORE! Please let those you know fighting cancer know about this so we can bring some much-needed JOY into their journey! "
4,WELLNESS,The Fear of Losing Control,"Nicole Glassman, Contributor

Your heart is pounding, your palms are sweating and you are terrified. But your intuition tells you to keep walking, to put one foot in front of the other. Your entire body is clenched, but you know you have to let go. You finally reach ""the moment"" and your whole body exhales. The anxiety melts off your skin and oxygen finally reaches your brain. You have conquered your fear. The journey was the challenge; the actual moment was the triumph. When was the last time you agreed to face your fears?Everyone has fears. Some are terrified of adventure or heights. Others are scared of failure or success. But many are fearful of change, truth and, most of all, losing control. Fear begins in the mind. We create a story, and our body and brain respond. If we tell ourselves that we are unsafe and life is scary, our situation will evolve accordingly. But if we tell ourselves that overcoming fear can lead to intense happiness, we will take more risks. The challenge is to control the mind.I recently went on a yoga retreat to Costa Rica with many fears. One of my more ""rational"" fears was zip-lining. The idea of being that high up and not feeling secure seemed like an unnecessary risk. Even though I had been adamant about not zip-lining, I surprised myself when I realized there was a part of me that was slightly curious. Something kept telling me to keep an open mind. Then one of the staff members at the retreat center decided to get to the root of my fears. She asked if I was afraid of heights. The answer was no. She asked if I could remember a time when I was afraid and how I handled it. This made me dig a little deeper. I wasn't afraid of heights. I was afraid of feeling out of control. What would I do if I had to actually let go? It was time to find out. Just as in life, the climb was the real experience. The ride in a flatbed truck up the unpaved mountainous roads was not the highlight of my experience. It did very little to quell my nerves, but it was symbolic. The journey isn't always smooth, but it is in those moments that you recognize your strength. I couldn't jump out. I just had to let go and trust.When I arrived at the first zip-line I was met with a sense of calm. I had already committed to the adventure and knew that I was there for a reason. My goal was to be more present, and I longed to feel free. As I lunged off the cliff and through the air, I felt a sense of pure exhilaration. I didn't just zip line once -- I did it 13 times!We can choose to let fear be a noose around our neck, holding our breath through life. We can choose to hold onto what we believe we can control, saying no to experiences that may seem risky. We can choose to walk on even ground, hoping that life will be a steady stream of simple experiences. We can choose to be satisfied, but less than passionate. Or we can choose to cut the cord, drop the safety net and truly live. Life isn't about controlling our surroundings. It's about controlling our mind, and believing that we are safe and life is a set of risks worth taking. What fears are you avoiding? When will you start living?For more by Nicole Glassman, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."
5,WELLNESS,How Your Deepest Insecurities Reveal Your Greatest Gifts,"Ken Page, LCSW, Contributor
Psychotherapist and bestselling author of ""Deeper Dating: How ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gift-theory_us_5b9d251fe4b03a1dcc84de79,"If we can name our own awkward, ardent gifts, and extricate them from the shame and wounds that keep them buried, we'll find ourselves on a bullet train to deep, surprising, life-changing intimacy.",2013-05-19,"Portrait of a worried man on black background, intentionally toned",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d251f250000330036571c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In my decades of practice as a psychotherapist, this is the insight that has inspired me most:Our deepest wounds surround our greatest gifts.I've found that the very qualities we're most ashamed of, the ones we keep trying to reshape or hide, are in fact the key to finding real love. I call them core gifts.It's so easy to get lost in the quest for self-improvement. Every billboard seduces us with the vision of a happier, more successful life. I'm suggesting an opposite road to happiness. If we can name our own awkward, ardent gifts, and extricate them from the shame and wounds that keep them buried, we'll find ourselves on a bullet train to deep, surprising, life-changing intimacy.Over the years, I realized that the characteristics of my clients which I found most inspiring, most essentially them, were the ones which frequently caused them the most suffering. Some clients would complain of feeling like they were ""too much""; too intense, too angry, or too demanding. From my therapist's chair, I would see a passion so powerful that it frightened people away.Other clients said they felt that they felt like they were ""not enough""; too weak, too quiet, too ineffective. I would find a quality of humility and grace in them which would not let them assert themselves as others did.Clients would describe lives devastated by codependency, and I would see an immense generosity with no healthy limits.Again and again, where my clients saw their greatest wounds, I also saw their most defining gifts!Cervantes said that reading a translation is like viewing a tapestry from the back. That's what it's like when we try to understand our deepest struggles without honoring the gifts that fuel them.When we understand our lives through the lens of our gifts, it's as if we step out from behind the tapestry and really see it for the first time. All of a sudden, things make sense. We see the real picture, the moving, human story of what matters most to us. We begin to understand that our biggest mistakes, our most self-sabotaging behaviors were simply convulsive, unskilled attempts to express the deepest parts of ourselves.Susan came to therapy after her boyfriend of two years left her. She had put the whole of her heart and all her energies into her relationship, and when it ended, she felt utterly destroyed. ""Why can't I let go and move on like he did, or as my friends tell me I should?"" she asked me on her first visit.As she described her relationship history, I saw a consistent quality of kindness in her; a soft-heartedness which people kept taking advantage of. Susan appreciated these qualities in herself, but she also felt like they were a curse. (That very ambivalence is one of the main indicators of a core gift.) I sensed that a key to her healing lay precisely there. Again and again, we worked at helping her reframe her sensitivity not as a weakness, but as a gift that she-as well as her former partners-didn't know how to honor.It sounds simple, but seeing these qualities as a gift was the foundation of new dating life for her. By seeing their worth, she could learn to understand, honor, and even treasure them.When Susan looked at her life through the lens of her gift, she felt triumphant. ""I was right all along!"" she said. ""Those things that bothered me about my boyfriends bothered me for a reason. I wasn't crazy. I just didn't honor my gift and I found men who were all too happy to agree with me.""I've named the approach I used with Susan ""Gift Theory."" The easiest way to explain Gift Theory is by starting with the image of a target. Every ring inward toward the center moves us closer to our most authentic self. In the center of the target, where the bull's-eye is, lie our core gifts.Core gifts are not the same as talents or skills. In fact, until we understand them, they often feel like shameful weaknesses, or as parts of ourselves too vulnerable to expose. Yet they are where our soul lives. They are like the bone marrow of our psyche, generating a living stream of impulses toward intimacy and authentic self-expression. But gifts aren't hall-passes to happiness. They get us into trouble again and again. We become most defensive-or most naïve-around them. They challenge us and the people we care about. They ask more of us than we want to give. And we can be devastated when we feel them betrayed or rejected.Since the heat of our core is so hard to handle, we protect ourselves by moving further out from the center. Each ring outward represents a more airbrushed version of ourselves. Each makes us feel safer, puts us at less risk of embarrassment, failure and rejection. Yet, each ring outward also moves us one step further from our soul, our authenticity, and our sense of meaning. As we get further away from our core gifts, we feel more and more isolated. When we get too far, we experience a terrible sense of emptiness.So, most of us set up shop at a point where we are close enough to be warmed by our gifts, but far enough away that we do not get burned by their fire. We create safer versions of ourselves to enable us to get through our lives without having to face the existential risk of our core.The Gift Theory model invites us to discover what our core gifts are (most of us don't really know), to extricate these gifts from the wounds that keep them buried, and to express them with bravery, generosity, and discrimination in our dating life. When we do this, we find healthy love moving closer.If you're looking for love, try to discover your own gifts. They shine in your joys and strengths, but they also live-and hide-right in the heart of your greatest insecurities and heartbreaks. If you learn to lead with them in your dating life, you will find-almost without trying -- that you're experiencing mutual attractions with people who love and treasure the very gifts you're discovering. In future blogs, we'll explore in much greater detail how to discover your own core gifts. In the meantime, I invite you to take two or three minutes to reflect on the following question:Are there essential qualities in you which have sometimes felt more like a curse than a gift? Perhaps you haven't known how to handle them, or maybe you've had the painful experience of other people misunderstanding or taking advantage of them. Take a minute to begin to put words on these qualities. As you name them, you'll learn to honor them, and you'll come to understand your struggles, your intimacy journey and your life story in a new way.If you'd like to receive information on Ken's new articles, classes, events and writings, please click here.Follow me on FacebookOriginally appeared in Psychology Today © Ken Page,LCSW.For more by Ken Page, click here.
