From high-heeled boots to glittery eyes, from utility belts to studded leather cone-bra shirts, the world's best designs, from Rodarte and Chloe to Chanel and Valentino, have been strutting down the catwalks in the Tuileries Garden. The styles all vary but one star has been shining bright through it all, and that is Instagram. Instagram photos with hashtag #PWF have been monopolizing the stream, and not just from media, stylists, designers and retailers but from the show's models, makeup artists, celebrities and guests. Weeks before the big fashion magazines hit the stands, Instagram photos have already captured the trends. Launched in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, the online photo-sharing and social networking service announced last week that it had surpassed 100 million registered users. But something interesting is happening, beyond how quickly the service has grown: Instagram is changing behavior. As The New York Times reported from New York Fashion Week last fall: ""All of the models walked onto the runway and stopped, each one taking a position under a spotlight and standing there for several seconds, offering an opportunity for editors to get a good shot ... Call it the Instagram moment.""Here are some Instagram moments from #PFW."

The school provides early education, nutrition and health services to 311 children from birth through age 5 from low-income families in Sullivan County, one of the poorest counties in the state of New York. The children receive 2/3 of their daily nutritional needs through meals, which include breakfast, lunch and snack, that are prepared at the school and served family-style in classrooms. The county Head Start program was expanded with a $1 million grant from President Obama's 2009 stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Head Start, administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the longest-running early education program for children of low-income families in the United States.

I was very fortunate to be in teacher education during some of these years. I held these principles dear to my heart and still do. I would like to share some of them with you.A child learns as a ""whole"" person. He constructs intellectual, physical, social, and emotional understandings as he interacts with the world. A child is not a ""sponge"" that just soaks up what the world does. The child's mind is always ""constructing"" knowledge; that is, formulating and reformulating concepts as he interprets all that is going on around him. All information goes through his own individual ""filters"" depending on heredity and environment.Learning is something a child does naturally, not something that must be forced on a child.A child learns to figure out how the world works through play. As they observe and interact with adult experiences, they seek to reenact those in their own creative childhood ways. Each child learns as he brings his own thoughts and ideas to life. He learns how to have meaningful conversation. He learns how to work with other children. He learns how to organize and plan.Teaching methods and educational experiences should be based on authentic knowledge of the developing child. Each child is unique, lives in a unique environment, and will live a unique life. Decisions regarding curriculum, teaching practices, and any forms of assessment should reflect this understanding.Each child has talents and abilities that should be identified and nurtured all along the educational journey. This is one of the most critical aspects of education.The child's brain needs meaningful stimulation through the five senses for nourishment. Learning environments should provide many opportunities. Symbolic representations should come after concepts are well-developed. There is no need to rush in the teaching of symbols. During the 1980s, we heard from many experts through enlightening books, how we bring psychological and physical harm to children when we hurry them along in educational ways that seem impressive to adults. This flawed methodology may adversely alter a child's healthy learning process. Learning engagements should be relevant and meaningful to the child's real life.Children love to explore and create. They should have varied opportunities both indoors and outdoors to do so. The natural world provides some of the best teaching and learning environments.Educational settings should encourage thinking, analyzing, and problem-solving.Learning is an essential life-long process to which schools contribute. The processes, methods, and modeling they experience there will create an imprint that will greatly affect their own desire for learning for the rest of their lives. Educational programs should be thoughtfully developed to reflect the developmental needs of children. Since every child is developing at different rates, varied outcomes are expected.A teacher should be a professional decision-maker, who strives to create ideal settings and experiences for each child. Professionals should always be guided by their knowledge of Educational Psychology, Human Growth and Development, and a vivid understanding of the cultural factors that interplay in learning.Learning should be framed in interdisciplinary ways...always weaving skills in with the needs of daily living. Rote learning should be minimized so that concepts can be developed and the processes of learning can be maximized.Children need their physical needs met. Nutrition and all aspects of good health should be cornerstones of childhood education. They need to feel safe and secure. They need to feel loved. They need to feel productive and competent as they are guided by caring adults to live out childhood experiences.By nature, young children are generally full of hope and positive longings. These should be treasured and nurtured. The teacher holds on to the potential for good in every child. I hope these reflections of mine will bring to mind a vision of wonderful learning, for we are all confronted with ways of teaching that give us cause for concern.My daughter called last evening and read aloud her first grader's homework to me on the phone. It was something like this:The most common spelling of ow in the initial and medial position is ou. The most common spelling of ow in the final position is ow. It is irregular to find ou in the final position or ow in the initial and medial positions. Circle the irregular words, then code them and read them. (A list of words followed.)I got a headache listening to these directions. I wonder how many young children and parents are being totally confused each day by teaching strategies that seem so disconnected from meaningful reading.I will close with one of my own writings from Education As It Could Be:Our children are a resource... a valuable holding-place for talent, energy, enthusiasm, hope, and a desire to know and understand. As with all resources, the potential is great if handled with care."

Some days I felt nearly ready to give up, though I knew in my heart I never would.

Watered down or otherwise, we're big whiskey drinkers. Not to brag or anything, but we were way ahead of the blade with the complete tutorial we gave you in our first book, Bitches on a Budget, but just in case you've forgotten the lesson, here is an abbreviated primer on all things whiskey. (Pay attention, we know it's a lot, but just think about that next trip to the bar -- soon, all those guys pretending they know whiskey will be weeping at your feet.)Is it whiskey or whisky? American and Irish whiskey are spelled with an ""e."" Scotch, Canadian and Japanese are spelled without an ""e.""Are Scotch, bourbon and rye all whiskeys? Yes. Whiskey is defined as a spirit made from a fermented ""mash"" of grain that is stored in a cask. Scotch refers to whisky produced in Scotland. Barley, corn and wheat (rye) are the main grains used for whiskey making. Bourbon's main grain is corn. Rye's, well, uh, is rye. Historically, barley was the key component of Scotch and Irish whiskey, although, outside of single or blended malts, most sold today are a blend of grains (barley, corn, wheat).What is a single malt scotch? Refers to a non-blended whisky, made in Scotland, from malted barley and produced at a single distillery. The Glenlivet, Highland Park, and Lagavulin are well known examples.What is malted barley? Barley soaked in water to facilitate the conversion of starches to sugar, which is then dried over a heat source before grinding. Scotch barley is often dried over a smoky peat fire. Typically, Irish whiskey with barley is dried in a kiln without peat (be a show-off and order the famous Irish single malt whiskey using the peat method -- the Connemara Single Malt).What is the difference between bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye? Bourbon, although originally produced in Bourbon County, Kentucky, can be made anywhere in the U.S. To be labeled bourbon, it must be made with at least 51 percent corn and stored in new charred oak barrels. Tennessee whiskey is also corn based. Unlike bourbon, though, these whiskey's can be made only in the state of Tennessee and utilize a sugar maple charcoal filtration system before storage that imparts a warm, sweet flavor.While some high-end specialty bottles will set you back big time, you should be able to score your very own whiskey bottle that you'd be oh, so proud to show off -- now that you know what you're buying! Besides, every woman needs a bottle of Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey, Black Maple Hill bourbon, and for extra-special occasions, Glenmorangie Sherry Wood Finish single malt scotch, hiding in the back of some cabinet.

These qualities have always been a part of my identity, my authentic soul. Without owing myself, or my time, to anyone, I was free to explore the world how I pleased. Having my daughter, Ava, four years ago began a transformation of my identity, and with it, anxiety. How would my identity in travel be affected by the potential limitations of having to care for another person? Would I forever be relegated to hotels and baby carriages, never to venture forth into the truly captivating locations off the beaten path?Quite the contrary. While the first few years of motherhood are not without obvious limitations, as Ava has grown older I have slowly introduced her to the globetrotting lifestyle that will provide her with an understanding and appreciation of cultures, and undoubtedly make her a more curious, educated, and interesting human being.In fact, Ava has offered me something priceless as well. She has given me new eyes to see the world, and a fresh perspective through the lens of innocence. There have been innumerable moments where she has perceived a city in ways I never would have considered, her joy on display at the discovery. No matter how open-minded we consider ourselves to be, we are all victims of our own point of view. There is no better way to challenge your expectations and expose your preconceptions than by marveling at a young arm outstretched, pointing at something you never would have noticed and perhaps never would have appreciated.For example, recently on our journey in Costa Rica, Ava noticed a ""wishing flower"" (a dandelion for those of you who couldn't guess), and wished for a unicorn to pick her up and take her to Tinkerbell's house. After only blowing off half of the seeds, she offered me the other half. My wish, of course, was for these moments to continue.If you have children, I encourage you to give you both the gift of travel. It will reinvigorate the well-worn traveler. And for those who seldom travel, give yourself the excuse to begin to with your son or daughter."

I spend a great deal of time working with teens, but recently, I have found myself smack in the center of answering parent questions. I guess that's what happens when you start seeing grey hair appear on your head in the mirror each morning.In any event, I'm pretty sure most parents are living life in a state of overwhelming. Soccer Practice.Football Workout.Work.School Assignments.Ballet.Band.Dance.Cheer.Chess.Early morning practice.College Applications.Work.Working out.Oh yeah, and those other three children need to do the same stuff!! What are we becoming? It's almost like our world is consisted of running from here to there in order to keep our kids on the track for success. But is it working? Are they more successful?I guess that's another article for another day. Today, I just want to help parents come back to earth, see life through the lens of reality and take a deep breath. I'm worried for this generation of parents, as it seems the stress of being a parent is grinding. So, here are a couple of things I've learned as a husband of one, father of five and full-time author, president of a small company and friend to many. 1.) You're raising adults, not kids. I think sometimes, we get this backwards. Sometimes, we have this notion that it's our job to raise children, but in reality, we are raising people to become successful adults. From post-puberty until the full logic formation of the frontal lobe of the brain, it's a parent's duty to put our children in places where they can make decisions and understand the consequences of their decisions in real time. If they forget their homework, let them forget. One or two bad grades won't keep them out of Harvard. If they forget their lunch, don't take it to them. Let them feel hungry. One meal won't make them starve -- AND this way, they won't forget tomorrow. If the earn a bad grade on a test, don't call the teacher. Let your teenager figure out how to resolve the mistakes they make. Coach, train, mentor and love; but don't let the burden of their success fall on you picking up the pieces all the time. I think lots of parents are stressed because they're living their own lives AND living their kids' lives. Remember: You are raising adults, not children. 2.) You're the parent. You decide! I've been working with parents on the effect of social media and mobile communication on their homes. It seems their kids might physically be in the house, but with a cell phone or a laptop, you're actually sitting with all of their friends too. I heard a parent last week say, ""Well, we decided to wait and give our kid an iPhone when they're 11."" I laughed out loud. Once, I recovered from my embarrassing moment, as I was the only one laughing, I realized this group of parents had no idea they could hold out on giving the cell phone and just be a parent. ""Did you know there was a time if you were carrying a cell phone, you were considered a drug dealer?"" I remarked. ""I didn't have a cell phone till I was 30, and I turned out OK. You're kid won't die without one.""I think too many parents are taking parental cues from other parents around them. If you want to hold out on the cell phone, good for you. If you want to help coach them how to use social media and take it slow, CONGRATULATIONS. You're being a parent. Don't let your community ramp up the stress, and then get swallowed in the black hole of activities. It's OK. Parent how you want to parent, and forget about what everyone else is doing.3.) You're kids are going to be OK. Find their gift. I know many parents who run their kids from event to event, returning home late at night only to fall into bed, exhausted. ""We've got to be on the traveling soccer team,"" one said. ""If he doesn't get into the right school, he won't be..."" another commented. It was like life was just pressing in tighter and tighter, and the vice of performance was squeezing the joy from the families I was talking with. They would look me in the eye with a wayward smile, but I saw in their eyes a place working to just survive. I believe every kid is given a gift. Some are athletic. Some academic. Some are born engineers. Others are artists. Find what THEY are good at, and stick to that for a while. They don't need to be running around to all these different events. They'll find the one or two things they are passionate about, and then just sit in confidence they're going to be OK.I believe there are steps to getting off the rat wheel of parental stress, but we all have to join together and stop trying to out perform each other. Rest. Relax. Take a Deep Breath. The world is still spinning. The sun is probably going to come up tomorrow. And everything is going to be OK."

The two biggest players in the nation's pursuit of high-speed rail said Thursday, Jan. 17, 2013, they'll work together to search for trains that will operate at up to 220 miles per hour along both coasts of the United States. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce2c72500003300363f4e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, as congressional leaders announced a plan to reauthorize funding for railroads across America, a new Brookings Institution study showed that the number of travelers taking advantage of Amtrak's services has grown rapidly over the last 15 years. According to the report, Amtrak went from carrying 20.1 million riders in 1997 to schlepping 31.2 million in 2012. The report makes a compelling argument for those championing the continuation of the government subsidies that have allowed Amtrak to prosper and grow. Though John Mica, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has repeatedly referred to Amtrak as a ""Soviet-style railroad"" and advocated selling off the railroad company's profitable Northeast Corridor to a private company, the new data shows Americans are coming back to the rails, especially along key routes.While Amtrak is showing growth across the U.S., the number of riders along certain routes has, quite simply, exploded. Though many of these routes likely service commuters, they mostly connect prominent but not major cities to outlying areas. As such, the success of these routes should be of particular interest to the common traveler, who will be able to explore more parts of the country without turning to rental cars as services expand.As often as Amtrak is derided by lawmakers, it's more often riden and revered by career travelers (and movie stars), for whom it offers an antidote to the hassle of air travel and a way to enjoy smaller, overlooked communities.The numbers in the new report may make a compelling argument in favor of the Obama administration's high-speed rail ambitions. The success of a country-wide network, modeled more on China than the USSR, would be largely dependent on travelers' willingness to forsake the skies in favor of trains. Citing examples indicative of the potential benefits of rail network growth, the Brookings report describes how the Downeaster service running from Boston to Portland, Maine has, ""Drawn thousands of additional travelers to Maine each year, increasing spending tourism, and the potential for future development."" There is no debate over whether or not a healthy Amtrak would be better for travelers, but it remains to be seen if the service is actually becoming sustainable or just losing money more efficiently. As that becomes more clear over the next few years, here are the regions where rail traffic is going up. These are not routes; they are areas where train travel -- and it should be noted some of that travel takes place on commuter rails -- is becoming increasingly popular."
