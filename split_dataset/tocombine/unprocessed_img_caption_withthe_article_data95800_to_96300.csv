Bilateral trade agendas with both U.S. and EU may become a way to mitigate the negative potential impacts of TTIP and TTP.,2015-02-26,2015-02-26-20150221slider_FTA_Export_Front_alphaspirit_0.jpg.jpeg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-02-26-20150221slider_FTA_Export_Front_alphaspirit_0.jpg-thumb.jpeg,"The landscape of international trade negotiations has been undergoing an upheaval. On the multilateral level, after 15 years of unsuccessful attempts to close the Doha Development Round at the World Trade Organization (WTO), the negotiation system has shown to be highly vulnerable to blockades by any small group of member countries. The complex web of diverse individual country objectives, cutting across several interrelated themes, made reaching a deal harder than originally expected. However, even when the scope was narrowed to a trade facilitation negotiation, as the one concluded in Bali in December 2013, it has yet failed to yield results. In the meantime, after the proliferation of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) in the world, the U.S. and the EU have decided to embark on so-called mega-trade negotiations. After the U.S. proposed a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with several countries of the Pacific region, the EU has accepted to negotiate a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the United States. From a diplomatic perspective, taking such an approach offers a way to overcome the difficulties in reaching consensus/compromise in the multilateral arena.At the same time, there is also the fact that large and rich negotiators have found a way to reinforce their asymmetric positions and agenda-setting capacity that tend otherwise to be partially diluted in multilateral, 100-percent-based negotiation tracks. By design, those mega-negotiations have a scope that goes much beyond tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade to encompass rules for trade-related issues such as investment and competition, as well as new themes like environment, climate change, labor regulation, and other issues. The inclusion of these sectoral issues in multilateral negotiations has faced tough resistance. It is also relevant that the weight of different barriers to trade has changed in the last few decades (Canuto, 2012a). As tariffs have on average been reduced, and as ""value chains"" and cross-border trade of services have flourished, regulatory divergence and non-tariff trade barriers have risen in relevance as trade-binding factors -- together with logistics constraints in many countries (Canuto, 2012b; 2013). That is why recent estimates of the potential impact of TTIP on EU countries show more meaningful results in scenarios where non-trade barriers are trimmed (see Felbermayr et al. 2013).Provided that meaningful content can be agreed upon, the size of the economies engaged in those mega-trade negotiations guarantees that outside countries will also be strongly impacted. There will be direct, first-order trade-deviation effects on exports and imports of goods and services, as countries not part of the negotiations will face preferences acquired by beneficiaries inside agreements. Furthermore, there will be second-order effects derived from subsequent competitiveness changes in those countries' inside agreements, as they will more readily attract investment and technology flows.Take Brazil, a relatively small global trader that has concentrated its bets on the multilateral arena. This has been illustrated by a series of simulations reported by Vera Thorstensen and Lucas Ferraz from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, on what would be the first-order impacts of TTIP and TPP on Brazil under different hypotheses of coverage of these agreements (see Thorstensen and Ferraz 2014).Chart 1 displays their aggregate results in terms of first-order impacts of TTIP on Brazil's bilateral trade with the U.S. and the EU, under three scenarios of completion of the agreement: (1) full tariff elimination between the EU and the U.S. (TTIP 100 percent); (2) the previous plus a 50-percent reduction of non-tariff barriers (TTIP 100 percent + NTB 50 percent); and (3) full elimination of both tariffs and non-tariff barriers (TTIP 100 percent + NTB 100 percent). Consistently with what we have noted above regarding current relative weights of tariffs and non-tariff barriers, as well as estimates of impacts of their elimination, first-order impacts on Brazil's exports and imports -- and corresponding negative consequences to the trade balance -- rise in significance as non-tariff barriers between the EU and the U.S. are lowered.Chart 1Extracted from Thorstensen and Ferraz 2014Chart 2 shows the authors' results in terms of first-order impacts of TPP on Brazil's total exports and imports. In addition to scenarios of full tariff elimination with and without a 50-percent reduction of non-tariff barriers, they also explored the hypothesis of China's participation in the agreement. One may notice again how the magnitude of impacts rises with the coverage of non-tariff barriers, particularly if China enters TPP. Chart 2Extracted from Thorstensen and Ferraz 2014The authors also simulate the case of Brazil adhering to TTIP. Brazil's exports, imports, and the trade balance are then positively affected, with gains particularly accrued by agricultural sectors. Let me offer two takeaways. First, although negative first-order impacts of TTIP and TPP on Brazil's trade may look non-dramatic, one should not lose sight of the fact that they tend to be reinforced by subsequent competitiveness improvements in the economies participating in the agreements. This comes in addition to the opportunity costs already incurred by Brazil because of its trade closedness (Canuto (2014), Canuto et al. 2015a; 2015b), especially as investment and technology flows tend to be diverted as a reflection of those mega-trade agreements.The potential impact of mega-trade agreements goes beyond how they affect trade, since exposure to increased competition at home and the impact of such a deals on export destinations and in third markets can boost productivity growth and improve competitiveness. This applies not only to tradable sectors, but also to non-tradable activities in participating economies. Second, and relatedly, Brazil might well review its prevailing trade negotiation strategy where efforts have focused on the multilateral track. Bilateral trade agendas with both U.S. and EU may become a way to mitigate the negative potential impacts of TTIP and TTP. Otaviano Canuto is a Senior Adviser and ex-Vice President at the World Bank.

1,POLITICS,Twelve Ways To Reverse California's Income Inequality,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-income-inequality_n_6764250.html,,2015-02-26,"The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge towers over the city skyline at dusk on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2015, in San Francisco. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8eaff220000bb01dd8220.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This piece was originally published by Capital & Main. “The California Chasm” is a challenge that threatens to transform the nation’s most populous state into a shadow of its former self. Once a place where people came together to realize fortunes, remake their lives and attain their piece of the American Dream, California has become a state saddled with sharp differences in social, economic and health outcomes due to race, place and class.Here is a set of bold recommendations for how California can rebuild its middle class and lay the foundation for a future that reclaims the bright promise of the Golden State.Raise the Floor1. Raise the Minimum Wage, Stop Wage Theft and Expand the Right to Sick Days: These measures are not sufficient to rebuild our middle class, but they are absolutely necessary as first steps.2. Encourage Employment for the Formerly Incarcerated: To reflect our state’s values of opportunity and reinvention, we must ease market reentry for those who have been convicted and served their time.3. Expand the Rights of Immigrants: We cannot wait for reform from Washington – the health of our economy and communities requires us to act now.4. Crack Down on the Misclassification of Workers: The law-breaking by employers is undermining our system of justice while also leaving millions of workers behind.Grow the Economy Together5. Fight Climate Change With Good Green Jobs: The two greatest challenges of our time – global warming and economic inequality – can and must be addressed together.6. Close Proposition 13’s Corporate Loopholes: It’s time to ride the third rail of California politics and restore fairness to our tax system.7. Promote Affordable Housing: California’s rising rents and home prices must be met with rigorous legislation as well as major investment.8. Invest Big in Public Transit: Large-scale, sustained investment in clean public transit is essential for creating livable communities and can generate a number of high-quality jobs.Create a Path to the Middle9. Provide Free Community College Education: California should take a page from President Obama’s playbook and open up our most important higher education institutions to everyone in a way that removes financial barriers.10. Close the Wealth Gap: It’s not enough to raise wages – we need to enable Californians to build their wealth and their personal safety nets.11. Strengthen Retirement Benefits: With nearly half of Californians set to retire into economic hardship, we need bold action, including contributions from a much broader set of employers.12. Renew Our Democracy: We need a thriving democracy to ensure broadly shared economic prosperity, and in California that means fostering civic engagement and finding creative solutions that remove barriers to participating in the political process.We hope this list is inclusive but we know it is not exhaustive. Every day, the creativity of Californians is demonstrated as they open new businesses, devise new technologies and experiment with new ways to engage the public and shift public policy. And so we see this as an invitation to readers and leaders to comment, discuss and offer new approaches to rebuilding California’s economy.Such a conversation is essential not only for our future prosperity but also for our democracy. After all, one of the most serious threats inequality poses is to our political system. When wealth rather than voice determines the directions our government will take, when policies tilt the playing field to reproduce disadvantage rather than to spread opportunity, that is a recipe for the erosion not just of the middle class but of our hard-won democratic rights.And the only antidote is more debate, more organizing and more participation. Indeed, civic engagement is the lifeblood of any effort to restore shared prosperity – and we hope that by raising tough issues, offering compelling stories and proposing real solutions, we can jumpstart the civic conversation and action we need to restore the luster of the Golden State."

The Illinois State Fair will run Aug. 7 through Aug. 17. (AP Photo/Seth Perlman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31c372400005000974178.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Llamas are big on the Internet, especially Thursday, because two escaped in Arizona.Funny enough, in the mid-1980s, llamas also were vehicles for financial speculation. The pitch was simple: Buy llamas, have the llamas make more llamas, sell the llamas, make money. It's a pretty simple, and pretty terrible way to try to make money. The only way it works is if the price of llamas keeps going up. Which, in the 1980s, it did -- for a while, at least. Then the price went down, and anyone owning llamas felt a bit like someone owning a whole bunch of tulip bulbs in in Holland in 1638.The 1980s llama investment craze was particularly acute in Oregon. Llama rancher Lynn Hyder told a The Bulletin in Bend, Oregon, in 1984 that ""they're a good investment and very profitable. ... No one has ever bought a female llama and not had their investment back in two or three years and doubled every year after that."" The problem was, this wasn't actually true. As The Bulletin noted at the time, ""There doesn't seem to be any reason for such inflation in llama prices except demand. Llamas aren't really good for anything."" Their wool is poor quality. They do make decent pack animals, but buying pack animals isn't really a profitable late-20th century investment strategy.And so the llama bubble, which saw prices reach into the $20,000 range, burst. You can now buy a llama for about a tenth of their bubble-era price. It was, in hindsight, a classic speculative livestock bubble. A similar boom-bust cycle is happening now with alpacas, which are being described, by someone who wants to sell you alpacas, obviously, as ""the world's finest livestock investment. ... Unlike the stock market, alpacas are depreciable over five years."" What could possibly go wrong?"
4,HEALTHY LIVING,More American Children Are Doing Yoga Than Ever Before,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/more-us-children-doing-_n_6764030.html,,2015-02-26,Mother do phisical exercises with her daughter at home,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e95a62000004e00fe6bea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Ronnie Cohen(Reuters Health) - A growing number of American children are bending into downward dog and other yoga poses, according to a new report on complementary health practices. The report analyzed National Health Interview Survey data on practices outside of mainstream medicine and found significantly more kids and teens practicing yoga, tai chi and qi gong in 2012 than in 2007.The study also showed a significant increase in the number of children using melatonin supplements as sleep aids. Melatonin is a natural hormone known to play a role in sleep.Yoga originated in India more than 5,000 years ago, and the mind-body practice has become so popular in the west that yoga studios are as common in parts of California as Starbucks coffeehouses.The new study, published in National Health Statistics Reports, included 17,321 interviews with adults about their 4- to 17-year-olds.Overall, 3.1 percent of kids did yoga in 2012, up from 2.3 percent in 2007.Industry data shows a nearly 8 percent increase in the number of yoga instructors during the same five years, the study authors write. In addition, they say, public schools are beginning to incorporate yoga - which fosters stretching, relaxing and developing strength - into fitness programs.The increase in children's use of yoga and melatonin was a surprise to Dr. Josephine Briggs, director of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH).""The changes in the yoga category are very large,"" she told Reuters Health. ""I was also struck by the use of melatonin in children.""In 2007, an estimated 1.3 million children did yoga, tai chi or qi gong, senior author Richard Nahin said at a news conference. The number grew to 1.9 million children in 2012, he said.Researchers included the Chinese practices of tai chi and qi gong in the analysis because they are also mind-body practices, and their inclusion bolstered the sample sizes and the statistical power of the findings.Girls were four times more likely to practice yoga, tai chi or qi gong in the prior year than boys, the study found.Use of melatonin increased 700 percent, from 0.1 percent to 0.7 percent of children, between 2007 and 2012, Nahin said.Briggs said she knew of no safety issues regarding melatonin for children. Rising use of the supplements may reflect burgeoning concern over use of benzodiazepines, a class of sedatives and anti-anxiety drugs prescribed for sleep problems, she said.""Use of conventional sleeping pills, like benzodiazepines, is of some concern,"" she said. ""Melatonin is a product that has a good safety profile.""Nonetheless, Briggs advises parents to discuss the use of yoga, melatonin and any health practices with their pediatricians.In addition to yoga and melatonin, researchers looked at dietary supplements other than vitamins and minerals as well as chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation, meditation, acupuncture, massage, homeopathy and biofeedback.Children with private health insurance were more likely to use chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation than children with public coverage. In 2012, children whose parents had more than a high school education were seven times more likely to use a complementary health approach as children whose parents had not completed high school, the study found.The results don't explain why a higher level of parental education led to more complementary health practices for children, Nahin told Reuters Health. But, he said, more educated parents might be better equipped to identify complementary approaches and practitioners.Wendy Weber, NCCIH branch chief for clinical research, said complementary medicine holds ""some areas of great promise."" In particular, she cited probiotics and mindfulness-based stress reduction.During the news conference, Weber advised parents to ask their teenagers about weight-loss and sports-enhancement products and to keep in mind that children are not just small adults.""While most of the body-mind approaches seem relatively safe, we don't know if they're appropriate for all children,"" she said. ""Just because it's something natural, doesn't mean that it's always safe to use.""She urged parents to consult healthcare professionals whenever children show symptoms.""It's extremely important not to delay treatment with a known, proven therapy,"" she said.SOURCE: http://1.usa.gov/1BvgHci National Health Statistics Reports, February 10, 2015."

But director Niki Caro said she was very “conscious” of avoiding a white savior plot. During an interview with the Motion Picture Association of America’s online magazine, The Credits, the film’s director said the story may be centered around White (Kevin Costner) but its real stars are the the individuals that make up the community. “We were very conscious of not making a white savior movie, and you could have with the material, but it was really important for us that he be a flawed guy who was ultimately redeemed by the community,” Caro told The Credits. “You see him become a better coach, a better father and a better man through his interaction with this place and these people.”The sports drama, released last Friday, seems to have struck a chord with critics and currently has a “Certified Fresh” rating from Rotten Tomatoes. In its opening weekend the film brought in $11 million at the box office, according to Deadline.Not to mention the film is in a league of its own as one of the few movies centered around the U.S. Latino experience. Smaller studios like the Latino-centric Pantelion Films have recently released films like “Spare Parts,” also based on a true story, but Disney’s “McFarland” is the only movie focused on the Latino condition in the United States to come from a major studio in the last few years. The inspirational tale may have a formulaic underdog story, but the director said she veered away from the formula when she opted to focus more on the human aspect of the story and less on the sports angle. Many have even noted the movie’s ability to touch upon controversial topics like immigration without getting political. The New Zealand-born Caro says being a foreigner gives her an advantage when telling these types of stories. “Being an outsider gives you a very privileged point of view to speak about stuff that doesn’t get spoken about a lot, and to do so without an agenda,” Caro said. “Paradoxically, the way I work when it’s not my own culture is I try to be very accurate and faithful to the way lives are lived and not impose my will. I was very keen to portray the Mexican American culture, but I realized that we made a very American movie, a profoundly American movie that happens to have a lot of Mexicans in it.”“There’s nothing more American than wanting a better life for your children, and working hard to give them that,” the director added. “And that’s all you see there, and I hope that comes through in the movie.”"
6,POLITICS,4 Ways the Drug War Harms National Security,"James Carli, ContributorDrug Policy and Sustainability Consultant",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/4-reasons-lawmakers-shoul_b_6762056.html,"Just think of where we could be as a nation if some of the people spending years in prison for a nonviolent drug offense could have, instead, studied sustainable architecture or climate change adaptation?",2015-02-26,"Teenage boy (16-17) getting handcuffed, rear view, mid section",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8eadf200000070201d91b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week, politicians are debating funding for the Department of Homeland Security. This is a good opportunity to explain to lawmakers why so-called ""counternarcotics operations,"" and the incarceration, violence and misappropriation of resources involved, should be excluded now from any approved DHS budget, and from any future defense spending bill that comes across their desks.The war on drugs (a term by which I mean the criminalization of drugs, drug use, drug possession, addiction and nonviolent voluntary drug transactions) threatens national security for the following reasons:1. The drug war causes Americans to lose trust in their domestic security forces and systems.As John Oliver succinctly put it last October: ""Public trust in the police is one of the most vital elements in a civilized society."" A country whose citizens do not trust its police is a country at increased risk of instability and civil disorder, with a decreased ability to contain it. Stable, healthy countries should possess a sense of pride for their internal security forces (ISFs) in order for them to be legitimate. In the United States, this term simply refers to local and state police, sheriffs and, in some cases, certain (but not all) divisions of the FBI, ATF and Department of Homeland Security. It is in these organizations' interests to have a positive public reputation, and the war on drugs undoubtedly harms that.2. The drug war harms America's soft power credibility.Soft power is the idea that countries can use their reputation and influence as a means of achieving their goals in the international arena, instead of just relying on coercive threats of military force (which is called hard power). Soft power is a critical element to gentlemanly relationships in foreign affairs, and without it, the world would be a much scarier place. When countries like North Korea echo your own organization's points in its own report to the United Nations on American human rights abuses, that's a problem that needs to be fixed. For America to have less than five percent of the world's population, but nearly 25 percent of its prisoners, how can the United States possibly negotiate in good faith to other countries on matters of human rights? The war on drugs hurts America's soft power credibility, diminishing our negotiating position, influence and world standing at a time when we need it more than ever.3. The drug war hinders American economic growth and productive capacity.Those prisoners mentioned above equal a huge productive force that is prevented from being productive. The drug war has famously cost as much as $2.5 trillion in upfront enforcement costs, but the hidden costs of lost productivity, lost creative capital and lost morale almost certainly cost much more than that. Just think of where we could be as a nation if some of the people spending years in prison for a nonviolent drug offense could have, instead, studied sustainable architecture or climate change adaptation? There is a huge workforce sitting behind bars that could be put to better use retrofitting naval ports for sea level rise or hardwiring our telecoms to safeguard against an electromagnetic attack. To have such great numbers of intelligent minds and work-capable bodies rotting uselessly behind prison bars will surely be one of the great crimes by the state against its own future.4. The drug war empowers and enriches non-state actors, those who do not operate within the rule of law, and those who explicitly seek to do us harm.When people purchase illegal drugs, they are taking dollars out of the system run by laws and putting them into a system that does not care about laws. The amount of capital loss to extra-legal groups (as much as $320 billion) has become so great, that cartels and terrorists now often possess more money than the governments that are supposed to be fighting them. This has exacerbated conflict and significantly increased the risk of state failure in places with already weak governance, like in West Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is also now threatening to destabilize larger, more institutionalized nations like Mexico. As has been clearly illustrated by the annals of history and medical science, the urge to experience altered perception is as natural as sex or hunger, so the answer is not simply :""Well, don't buy drugs."" People are going to buy drugs, so a pragmatic way to stop their dollars from flowing outside of the rule of law is to bring all drugs under the rule of law. As long as any drug remains criminalized in any country, terrorists will retain a steady, stable source of funding.Within the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, there are four broad operational cones: counterterrorism (CT), counterintelligence (CI), counterproliferation (CP) and counternarcotics (CN). The first three of these are, arguably, important and appropriate roles for government, and the fourth is counterproductive, taking resources from and exacerbating problems for the others. Indeed, counternarcotics operations are the very core of the actual ""War"" on Drugs, and ending the drug war would require defunding CN ops. Because the ship of state is slow to turn, the engines of the drug war must be shut down immediately to halt any further threat and destruction to our stability, security, and credibility on the domestic and international stages.James Carli is a Development Coordinator at the Drug Policy Alliance.

Are you a closet hoarder? Are you holding on to things in your life because you don't know how to get rid of them? Let's face it. Getting rid of old books and knickknacks is much easier than tossing out a relationship, a weekly class, a house that is too big, or a job that doesn't suit your passions.So what do you do to declutter your life?1. First take inventory of your life and thoughts. What overwhelms you? Spend a day taking notes of your thoughts. When you wake up in the morning what are you thinking about? When you are driving from here to there, what are you thinking about? Take note of your mind filling thoughts and they will lead you to where the clutter resides in your life.2. With your list in hand make a three-columned chart with one column labeled ""keeper,"" one labeled ""get rid of,"" and the final column labeled ""?"" Now separate out your previous list into columns of where the items on your list belong. Be honest with yourself. Don't edit your thoughts or gut feelings. Don't let fear choose for your. Remember this is just a list. It isn't a permanent decision. Ask yourself these questions, -- Does it bring joy? -- Are you holding on to out of fear or guilt? -- Does it only sometimes feel right? -- Are you following an expectation?3. Now that you know what is a keeper -- enjoy these items and appreciate them as a part of your life. As for your ""get rid of"" list, just like when you de-clutter your living room, you have to decide how to get rid of what you no longer need. Some things go to friends, some to thrift stores and some even the trash. But where do these real life ""things"" go?  Decisions need to be made. Start brainstorming how you can get rid of each thing. Sometimes it will be as easy as just cancelling an exercise class you really don't like. Sometimes it may take more work like choosing a different career path. This will definitely take a bit more work. But don't let the fear get the best of you. Be brave and bold. Remember to get rid of that which does not serve you.As for the maybe list, sit with these items for the time being. Once you are better at decluttering your life you will eventually know exactly what list they belong in, ""keeper"" or ""get rid of.""  4. Finally live and do with ease. Life should be easy and things that are meant to be will be. When thing get or feel hard, there is a reason for it. Life isn't meant to be difficult. When it gets difficult ask why. Don't push when things don't feel right. De-cluttering your life allows for movement and freedom. Fill your days with those things that make you feel free and light. In time you will wake with a mind that will see the light streaming through the curtains and a day full of everything you want. Free and light!"

You plan your trip; you make your trip; hopefully there's fresh snow and blue skies; you find some great lodging; you have a great time and you head home. Perfect.But some areas are just a bit different, and could make a good choice if you want a ski vacation that's a little out of the ordinary. PHOTO: Mt Shasta Ski Park1. Mt. Shasta, California Mt. Shasta in California isn't the biggest or flashiest resort in California but it does, some believe, have something other resorts in the Golden State do not -- a hidden alien city beneath the slopes.Indeed, you'll probably enjoy your day on the slopes without ever realizing that beneath your feet, under the snow and indeed the entire mountain, lies the underground city of Telos, inhabited by descendents of the Mayan civilization who now travel to at least seven intergalactic star systems.2. Lagunillas, Chile If your tastes run to ghosts rather than aliens, then a summertime trip to Lagunillas, a mid-sized area located some 30 miles from Chile's capital, Santiago, must be in the cards.There's been skiing here for more than 80 years, but the Legend of La Lola goes back still further to the start of the last century. The story goes that one dark and stormy night, a mule driver was killed and his grieving widow set out, dressed in white flowing robes, to search for him. She never returned and the legend is that she still wanders what are now ski slopes, occasionally appearing to distressed skiers and mule drivers in bad weather.Always ready to respect a good story, the local ski club is reported to organize an annual race in which hooded, pole-less skiers attempt to emulate the mourning widow in style as well to demonstrate their skiing prowess. The winner then has to try to ""personify the widow's spirit"" over the following year.3. Batea Mahuida Snow Park, Argentina Over the border in Argentina, things can get complicated if you want to get to know any of the staff at the Batea Mahuida Snow Park.Established on the Mahuida Volcano by the indigenous Puel Tribe in July 1999, all Batea Mahuida Snow Park's staff come from one of sixty families that make up the community. All members of the staff are closely or more distantly-related and share the same surname, 'Puel'.In terms of local après ski delicacies, there is a snack bar where you can taste the regional ""piñones,"" a sacred fruit for the tribe. PHOTO: Smugglers' Notch4. Smugglers' Notch, Vermont Back in the U.S., and across the country in Vermont, it was neither aliens nor ghosts that were responsible for the unlikely location of a chairlift's base station.It's a little known fact that half a century ago, Smugglers' Notch was once owned by Tom Watson, Jr., then chairman of IBM.Tom was into ""superlatives"" in a big way, so when he installed the first chairlift on Madonna Mountain, he decided that in order to make it ""the longest bottom-drive chairlift in the U.S.A.,"" he had to drop it down a couple of hundred feet from the logical starting point for the chair. That's why today you ski down to get on the lift. 5. Gassan, Japan How about a ski resort that can't open in the winter because there's too much snow?That's the claim made by Japan's only summer ski area, Gassan in Yamagata prefecture, a small area served by an aged double chair.The ski slopes are snow-covered year round. In fact, there's so much snow in the winter that the resort can't actually be reached by road nor can the staff crank up the lifts until a bit of it melts away by the start of Spring. Typically, Gassan's season runs from early April to late July.6. Aso Choe Jinko, Japan Japan has another rare attraction, the chance to ski through volcanic ash at another tiny resort, Aso Choe Jinko, which is noteworthy for being located on the side of a constantly smoking, live volcano.Snow cover is reported to last for only a fortnight each year. The rest of the time, there's an artificial surface slope.7. Lech, Austria If you enjoy boating as much as skiing, then you might opt for a ski resort near a big Lake. (Tahoe immediately comes to mind.)But in Austria, 4,750 feet up in the famous Arlberg region, the exclusive resort of Lech has no sizable areas of open water in the vicinity (the nearest stretch of open sea is several hundred miles away). That fact, however, has not stopped residents of the village establishing their own yacht club, where well-heeled members can get together and discuss all things boat-related while they're out on the slopes. PHOTO: Serfaus8. Serfaus, Austria And if you're in Austria for a bit of boat-based discussion, why not check out one of the world's smallest metro systems?The resort of Serfaus has been around for over 3,000 years. It has a population of 900... and a levitating underground railway. The tiny Tyrolean village's railway uses magnetism to hover a millimetre above the ground for a seamless ride through four stations, free of charge from your hotel to the bottom of the lifts. Marvelous!So, if you are looking for something a little different on your next ski holiday, check out one of these out-of-the-ordinary ski areas that are out there waiting for you!By Patrick Thorne / @Snowhoper."
10,BLACK VOICES,"Fifty Years Later, Questions About Malcolm X's Assassination Remain","Earl Ofari Hutchinson, ContributorAuthor and political analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/malcolm-x-assassination-questions_b_6678448.html,"There is no evidence that the FBI, other intelligence agencies, or the NYPD had a direct hand in Malcolm's murder. But it can't be totally separated from the well-documented, savage war that the FBI waged against black organizations and black leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr., during the 1960s.",2015-02-25,"Malcolm X, the black Muslim leader; photographed in New York march 5, 1964. Born Malcolm Little, he evolved into a charistic, but controversial black militant leader who converted to the black muslim religion, the nation of islam, while in prison. He founded the OrganizatioN of Afro American Unity; claiming the need for black unity befould be a black-white unity. Malcolm X was shot to death at age 39 in a Harlem, New York, Ballroom 65. (AP Photo/Eddie Adams)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae06b11f0000df0022d4dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Five years ago Thomas Hagan was paroled after having served 44 years in prison for his part in the murder of black nationalist leader Malcolm X. Hagan, who went by the name ""Talmadge Hayer"" at the time of the murder, is the only one of a trio of convicted assassins who ever publicly admitted to killing Malcolm. He bluntly said that he joined the assassination team because of Malcolm's public attacks on the Nation of Islam. Hagan's explanation still doesn't satisfy many who see much more than a killing by a disaffected, misguided, rogue group of black assassins. Fifty years after Hagan and the others gunned down Malcolm on Feb. 21, 1965, questions linger around whether there was more -- much more -- to the killing than what Hagan has said. A petition through the White House's online petition site has been launched to demand that the federal government release all files related to the Malcolm X assassination. The point of this effort is twofold: 1) to toss the spotlight back on the federal government to determine to what extent, if any, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, other intelligence agencies, and/or police agencies were involved, either knowingly or tacitly, in the killing; and 2) to force government transparency in its dealings with radical activists.For now, though, the official answer is that Malcolm's murder was a revenge killing for the bitter and contentious attacks he made on his former mentor and father figure, Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad. Louis Farrakhan candidly admitted years later, ""There was not a Muslim who loved the Honorable Elijah Muhammad that did not want to kill Malcolm."" At the time, Farrakhan repeatedly lambasted Malcolm as a betrayer of the faith. Years later, though, Farrakhan attempted a public reconciliation with Betty Shabazz, Malcolm's widow, and other family members.Hagan and his two known accomplices were indeed fanatic followers of Muhammad. But did they really kill Malcolm out of blind vengefulness? Were there others involved? And who stood to benefit the most from Malcolm's death? Those are the tough questions that demand answers but remain shrouded in mystery.The men almost certainly hated Malcolm and believed they were being good Muslims by killing him. However, the FBI and the New York City Police Department's super-secret, elite undercover unit, the Bureau of Special Services (BOSS), also hated Malcolm. They waged a fierce, shadowy, illegal campaign to undermine Malcolm and the Nation of Islam. They riddled the Nation of Islam and Malcolm's group, the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU), with informants and police agents. They tailed him on his travels in Africa and the Middle East. FBI and BOSS agents reported every word of his speeches and press conferences.FBI officials were well aware of the threats made on Malcolm's life by Muslims, and they knew that some in the Nation of Islam were more than willing to murder him. Months before the killing, FBI informants supplied FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover with verbatim accounts of death threats made against Malcolm at black Muslim meetings. During a European jaunt, Malcolm was not allowed to leave the airport in London and Paris, reportedly because British and French intelligence agencies feared there would be an assassination attempt against him in their countries.The FBI's interest in Malcolm's murder didn't stop with the apprehension of his killers. FBI agents closely monitored the trial proceedings. Memos to top FBI officials reveal that their prime concern was with protecting the informants and undercover agents who'd been planted in Malcolm's organization from public exposure. At one point during the trial, Hagan claimed that a non-Muslim had promised him several thousand dollars in exchange for the murder of Malcolm X. The prosecutor and defense attorneys did not press him to name names. The judge sternly warned the jury to consider only the parts of Hagan's testimony that were directly pertinent to the case and disregard the rest of his statements. His statement may have simply been hyperbole to get press attention or inflate his importance, but they represent another loose end that deliberately was not tied up.There is no evidence that the FBI, other intelligence agencies, or the NYPD had a direct hand in Malcolm's murder, and the contours of any conspiracy involving anyone other than the black Muslims remain hazy, problematic, or nonexistent. But Malcolm's murder can't be totally separated from the well-documented, savage war that the FBI waged against black organizations and black leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr., during the 1960s. In an infamous memo from those years, FBI officials flatly warned of the necessity of preventing the rise of a ""black messiah"" among blacks. The FBI was able and more than willing to do whatever it could to make sure that that didn't happen. Could Malcolm have been an unwitting casualty of Hoover and the FBI's obsession with undermining black leadership? FBI officials undoubtedly shed few tears over his murder.The whitewashing of the issues and mystery that often surround the murder of a popular but controversial leader always raises questions and doubts, no matter how many years pass. Fifty years later, those questions about Malcolm X's assassination remain.Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

During what should have been a pinnacle in the modeling career I'd held dear, I was enraptured and controlled by an eating disorder. My emaciated body had been surviving on carrots and Coke Light, yet felt gigantic and punishable. If I could eat as little as possible and burn more than I chewed, I might finally reach thinness -- i.e., happiness, success, perfection; I had to run.I stepped out of my tiny flat and headed toward the Seine. The Eiffel Tower came into full view atop the pastel sunrise -- a living, breathing Monet. The dewy earth squished beneath my feet as I ran to the rhythm of calorie-counting‚ estimating the previous day's ""damage."" So accustomed to the accompanying dizziness, anything else would've felt foreign. But this time was different.Pushing the added off-ness aside, I observed a dip in the ground ahead. It looks like an adult-sized cradle. Perhaps I sensed what was coming.Increasingly dizzy, I couldn't outrun the inevitable. I fell to the ground, as though in slow motion. And for a brief, savory moment, I felt weightless.I awoke later, lying in the grassy cradle, the taste of blood and dirt in my mouth. Rather than contemplate how long I'd been there or if I'd been hurt, one thought filled me with terror: Does dirt have calories?I don't recall how I made it to the medical center, only the words of the British doctor: ""You have anorexia. You could've died... could die.""My thoughts went wild: I can't have anorexia. Please don't make me eat. I felt neither thin nor ""skilled"" enough to have a disorder marked by starvation. I began treatment and fought harder to remain ill. After accepting my diagnosis, anorexia seemed like the one special thing about me. ""Recovery"" seemed synonymous with ""fatness,"" ""failure"" and ""mediocrity."" When my therapist threatened hospitalization, I lied, promising to gain necessary weight. Then one of my nightmares came true: I gave in to my longing for a bite of chocolate ice cream. As I placed the sweet dollop in my mouth, my entire body trembled. Head-to-toe orgasm. Intoxication. Relief. But one bite turned into two, then six, until all that remained of the half-gallon sat like a rock in my shrunken stomach. A bingeing/starving roller coaster ensued, worsening until I had little awareness of all I'd consumed until I found myself sobbing amid wrappers and crumbs. ""I will do anything to stop this,"" I told my therapist.""Good,"" she said. ""After bingeing, don't skip your next meal.""Anything but that, I thought, holding staunchly to the belief that if I were strong enough, I could attain the thinness I desired while stopping bingeing. Utopia. Meanwhile, I mourned the loss of my anorexia like a lost soulmate.One night after a gargantuan binge, I considered gulping the poison I'd used occasionally to vomit, aware of the life-threatening risks. When I couldn't find it, my heart raced. I struggled to breathe.Then something remarkable happened. Incapable of purging in any of my viable methods, I calmed down. That calmness paired with tired frustration brought clarity: Try something new.I walked with trepidation to my wall mirror, and looked not at my belly or thighs, but my eyes. The head-on stare punctured the swollen balloon of hurt inside me, releasing sobs.""You can't live like this anymore!"" I cried. ""This is not who you are."" These proclamations were the first signs of self-love I'd displayed in years, a light in the dark cave I lived in. If I kept it on, I knew my life would change. So rather than plot restriction strategies, I plotted a future free of ED.I threw my ""skinny clothes"" and scale away, and removed the size-tags from clothes that fit. I vowed that for one year, I would not make any attempts at weight loss. If I gained weight during that year, so be it. The next morning with trembling hands I ate breakfast, forcing thoughts of I love you, You're going to be okay.The bingeing continued at first, until I doubled my lowest weight. Still, I carried on, sans restriction. I had nothing to lose by trying and everything to lose by not.Months later, my eating had normalized and my life was beginning to feel like a life. I was in college, making friends and even, on occasion, laughing. But I still felt awkward eating around others. Hunger and fullness put me on-edge. And though I resisted, I longed to diet. ED hadn't left. He'd merely grown quieter.Over tea one afternoon, my mom gave me a CD featuring Lee Ann Womack's, ""I Hope You Dance.""""It's time to find joy,"" she said. (And here I'd thought I had everyone fooled.)The song's message about ""dancing"" hit me full-force. I'd been eating because I was supposed to and never wanted to go off the bingeing/starving deep-end again. To recover fully, I had to manifest joy around eating.With a velocity I'd only previously applied to treadmills, I began studying food from a new perspective: health and happiness. I obtained a certification in nutrition, volunteered at soup kitchens and challenged myself to eat mindfully, dine in public and savor the ice cream that triggered my first binge, one serving at a time. On difficult days, I asked myself what I'd feed a dear friend then treated myself to just that, until gradually, finally, I became her.One cool spring evening, I sat at my kitchen table eating spicy chili and fresh-baked cornbread. An unexpected breeze swept through my window, carrying a flower from outside into my bowl. Plunk! As the pink petals swam amongst the diced tomatoes and cannellini beans, I laughed. Struck my amusement, I realized that nothing but goodness sat at my table. A variation of this post first appeared on August McLaughlin's Blog.Need help?

Her online program, one of many owned by Corinthian Colleges Inc., saddled her with more than $70,000 in debt. She had hoped the degree would lead to a career as a probation officer. Instead, she could only find work as a hotel housekeeper, she told Education Undersecretary Ted Mitchell and Deputy Assistant Secretary Lynn Mahaffie, according to a transcript of the event. Suggs is now unemployed.Corinthian, once one of the nation's largest for-profit college chains with more than 110,000 students, is effectively shutting down under the weight of numerous state and federal probes that allege it cheated students by lying to them about job placement and graduation rates. Though the chain has previously disputed allegations from state and federal authorities that it defrauded students, it recently sold more than 50 campuses under pressure from the U.S. Department of Education, and Canadian authorities last week forced another 14 into bankruptcy.A contingent of former students, backed by prominent student advocates, the Massachusetts attorney general and more than a dozen Senate Democrats, has demanded the Education Department forgive federal student loans that thousands of people took out to attend Corinthian's schools. The department has the authority to cancel loans in instances where students demonstrate that schools defrauded them. Lawyers from the Department of Justice have argued that Education Secretary Arne Duncan has ""complete discretion"" when it comes to canceling loans for all students at a particular institution if he determines it defrauded students, even absent a formal application from individual borrowers.But in the case of Corinthian, the Education Department has done almost everything it can to avoid forgiving any taxpayer-backed debt incurred by current and former Corinthian students. In response, Suggs and 14 other former Corinthian students announced on Monday that they will not repay any federal student loans they took out to attend Corinthian's schools. They're calling it a debt strike.""The Department of Education allowed this to happen,"" Suggs said Monday about her experience at Everest and subsequent struggle to find work. ""It's their responsibility to make sure these schools hold up their end of the bargain. If they kept up their promises, I'd pay it back. But they haven't done anything, so why should I pay?""With help from anti-debt activists borne out of the Occupy Wall Street movement, the ""Corinthian 15"" students are challenging the Education Department and Duncan over lackluster supervision of a chain of for-profit colleges. In refusing to make payments, the group alleges the department allowed Corinthian to lure students into taking out loans backed by taxpayers that were used to pay a company that lied about the quality of education students would receive.Experts in higher education have previously assailed the Education Department for its spotty track record in protecting students from unscrupulous colleges. Some have said the department views colleges as its partners, rather than as regulated entities. Others have said the department puts the needs of colleges over those of students.After a multi-year investigation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal agency charged with protecting borrowers from unscrupulous lenders, accused Corinthian in September of inflating its job placement rates by creating fake companies, defining a ""career"" as a job that lasted one day with the promise of a second, and by paying employers to temporarily hire its graduates.In effect, Suggs and her like-minded colleagues argue that since the Education Department should've known Corinthian students would have difficulty repaying their loans, they shouldn't be held responsible when the loans come due. By giving Corinthian the ability to tap federal student aid, the Education Department -- rather than students -- should be on the hook for loan defaults, the group says.""I'm not going to pay anything,"" Suggs said. ""I had perfect attendance, graduated when I was supposed to, and this is what I get in return for trying to better myself. I have nothing, and it's not my fault.""The consequences of a default can be devastating. A borrower's credit report is wrecked, which can reduce his or her ability to get future loans or even a job. Tax returns are seized. To recoup its money, the Education Department will even garnish a borrower's Social Security payments to the point where monthly checks are below federal poverty thresholds.With unpaid student loans swelling to more than $1.3 trillion, prompting dire warnings about future effects on the growth of the U.S. economy, new pressure is being placed on the Education Department to improve how it regulates colleges and manages the federal student loan program.For former Corinthian students, they’re likely to learn that the department is unwilling to acknowledge its oversight failures by allowing them to discharge their debts. The department’s history suggests the debt strikers are unlikely to obtain much, if any, relief.Take the experience of students who attended for-profit schools operated by Wilfred American Education Corp. Last year, the New York Legal Assistance Group sued Duncan on behalf of thousands of low-income borrowers who took out federal student loans to attend Wilfred schools, in an effort to force Duncan to stop collecting on their loans and cancel them all based on Wilfred's alleged defrauding of its former students.In their complaint, the lawyers alleged that the Education Department has known for years that former Wilfred students had been cheated by their schools, pointing to criminal convictions of former Wilfred executives, federal court determinations that the company's schools defrauded taxpayers, and past Education Department reviews that found the company's schools had falsely certified that former students were eligible for federal student loans.In fact, according to the complaint, the department's in-house auditor recommended in 1996 that the department approve all loan cancellation requests by former Wilfred students. The inspector general pointed to the fact that the Education Department found fraud at the company's schools more than a decade earlier.The Education Department fought the lawsuit by arguing in part that because Duncan has the discretion to cancel former Wilfred students' loans, rather than an obligation, the courts had no say in the matter. The judge in the case reluctantly agreed, ""despite the reality and credibility of plaintiffs' grievances,"" he said.In the Corinthian case, the Education Department has had ample warnings that the company's schools may be cheating students and taxpayers.The state of California settled with Corinthian in 2007 after amassing evidence that it allegedly inflated its job placement rates. The state of Massachusetts launched an investigation in 2011. California sued the company again in 2013, alleging it lied to students and its investors about job placement rates.In January of last year, the Education Department denied Corinthian's request to expand because, as Duncan explained in an August letter to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the company ""had admitted to falsifying placement rates and/or grade and attendance records at various institutions and because of ongoing state and federal investigations into serious allegations with respect to Corinthian's administration of the Federal Student Aid programs.""The issues suggested ""systemic deficiencies"" at Corinthian, Duncan said. In July, the Education Department moved to effectively shut down the company by forcing it to sell off or close its schools.Meanwhile, current and former students were left to fend for themselves. The Education Department left it to Corinthian to inform students about its troubles. By comparison, the federal consumer bureau published a special bulletin meant for current and former Corinthian students that explained what the agency found and steps students should take.Suggs said school officials dismissed her questions about the company's regulatory woes during her final semester. Joe Hixson, a spokesman for Corinthian at Abernathy MacGregor Group, did not respond to requests for comment.While enrollment likely dropped, according to Corinthian's disclosures to investors, federal student aid still poured in.Even after the Education Department struck a July deal with the company that called for it to dismantle itself, the department originated more than $253 million in federal loans for students attending Corinthian campuses during the six-month period ending Dec. 31, department data show. More than $156 million in federal grants were disbursed to Corinthian students. Federal student aid money inevitably flowed to Corinthian in the form of tuition and fees.In other words, despite Education Department concerns that Corinthian was misleading its students, taxpayers continued to subsidize the company and enrich its executives through hundreds of millions of dollars in federal student aid.Over the last 4 and 1/2 years, the Education Department has disbursed $6 billion of public money in the form of loans and grants to students at Corinthian’s campuses, department data show. Nearly all of that has likely gone straight to the company.In December, while citing lawsuits filed by state attorneys general and the federal consumer bureau, 13 Senate Democrats, including Warren, Richard Durbin of Illinois and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, urged the department to forgive debts incurred by Corinthian students.Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey asked Duncan earlier this month to acknowledge the evidence her office has gathered in documenting Corinthian's alleged frauds by canceling federal student loans taken out to attend Corinthian schools in her state.""Schools should not obtain public monies based on actions in violation of state law, and students should not be required to pay for such violations,"" Healey said in a Feb. 4 letter.""By failing to provide broad debt relief for Corinthian students, this administration is continuing the [Education] Department’s decades long practice of relentlessly pursuing borrowers, even when there is voluminous evidence that unscrupulous school operators engaged in widespread illegal recruitment practices,"" said Robyn Smith, a former California deputy attorney general who now works on student loan issues for the National Consumer Law Center.In a prepared statement, Education Department spokeswoman Denise Horn indicated no such relief was forthcoming.""As we continue our conversations with students and advocates about options for borrowers, we also encourage borrowers to continue paying their student loans and to explore the various income-based repayment options offered by the department in order to avoid risking the serious consequences of default,"" Horn said.Suggs dismissed the suggestion. Even though she has no income, and likely could qualify for a repayment plan that would allow her to remain in good standing by making monthly payments of $0, Suggs said she'd rather fall into default than acknowledge the legitimacy of the loans.Earlier this month, the new buyer of more than 50 former Corinthian schools announced that current students enrolled in their criminal justice programs would be given a full refund upon request.The program was among many that had ""failed to keep pace with workforce demands and that have consistently fallen short of meeting baseline standards for job placement,"" according to Zenith Education Group, an arm of debt collector and Education Department contractor ECMC Group.Suggs is the kind of student the Education Department had tried to protect in keeping Corinthian's schools open. While student advocates urged the department to allow the schools to shut down, which would give Corinthian students the opportunity to get their federal loans cancelled, Education Undersecretary Ted Mitchell defended the department-brokered sale to Zenith by arguing that the plan would allow students to finish programs ""that they have worked so hard to obtain.""""This sale ... will avoid disruption and displacement for tens of thousands of students -- approximately 22 percent of whom are within 3 months of graduating,"" Mitchell said in December.Suggs graduated in October, making her ineligible for Zenith's refund option. She said that had she been given the option, she would've taken the refund and had it applied in full to the federal student loans she took out to attend classes at Corinthian.Instead, she said, she's stuck fighting an Education Department that refuses to acknowledge its mistakes.
