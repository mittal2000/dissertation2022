A week-long spell of unseasonably warm, sunny weather has recently exacerbated the problem.Under the scheme, drivers may only use their cars on alternate days, according to the odd or even numbers on their licence plates. Free public transport, including cycle and electric car-sharing schemes, was introduced last week as a visible haze hung over Paris streets.""Our core objective is to ensure public safety because we want to end this pollution,"" Environment Minister Philippe Martin told a news conference on Sunday, warning that the air quality was likely to worsen on Monday.Last week European Environment Agency (EEA) figures for Thursday showed there was 147 microgrammes of particulate matter (PM) per cubic metre of air in Paris - compared with 114 in Brussels, 104 in Amsterdam, 81 in Berlin and 79.7 in London.Political opponents and car associations criticised the decision, saying it would be tough to police, and accused the Socialist government of conceding to pressure from its coalition Green partners ahead of local elections in late March.""This is impossible to enforce, stupid and an attempt to win votes,"" Pierre Chasseray, president of drivers' lobby 40 Millions d'Autombolistes, told French televion and newspapers.Opposition UMP chief Jean-Francois Cope and mayor of Meaux in the suburbs of Paris, said there was a lot of confusion about the scheme.""The ecologists have applied a lot of pressure on the government and the decision was rushed.. It lacks coherence, explanation and - on the ground, as a mayor from one of Paris's suburbs - it's panic,"" he told Europe 1 radio.The last restricted driving scheme was introduced in October 1997 in response to pollution from heavy diesel fumes. It lasted one day. (Reporting By John Irish; Editing by Sophie Walker)"

Unfortunately, this year, the parties were not able to come to an understanding that would have made that possible.""Organizers of St. Patrick's Day parades in New York and Boston, among the most liberal-leaning cities in the United States, have come under increasing criticism in recent years for banning openly gay marchers.Parade organizers argue that to do so would conflict with their Roman Catholic heritage. The Catholic church contends that homosexual activity is immoral.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio also plans to boycott his city's parade, scheduled for Monday, in protest.On Friday, two major beer companies, Sam Adams brewer Boston Beer Co and Heineken dropped their sponsorship of parades in Boston and New York, respectively, over the issue.In Boston, Walsh had tried to reach a deal for MassEquality's members to march openly, rather than without any identification of their sexual orientation as required by parade organizers.The invitation to MassEquality was subsequently rescinded by the parade organizers, who said they had been ""misled"" about the number of veterans in the gay and lesbian group.Massachusetts in 2003 became the first U.S. state to legalize gay marriage. Attitudes on gay marriage have changed markedly across the nation since then, with 17 states and the District of Columbia now allowing same-sex couples to wed.

The rise in store closings is a prominent sign of their struggles. Weakened companies cannot afford the real estate and personnel costs that go along with supporting hundreds of unprofitable locations. The clearest proof of the problem was Radio Shack’s recent decision to close more than 1,000 stores.Radio Shack is hardly alone. During that last several years Gap has closed 20% of its locations. Even Macy’s, which has forecast strong earnings and is considered the most successful of the mid-market retailers, closed stores recently.(Click here to see the 9 retailers closing the most stores)A number of factors can lead companies to close stores. One is mergers and acquisitions activity. As organizations join forces under a single umbrella, locations that once competed for sales can become redundant, leading to store closings. The most recent example of this is the marriage of Office Depot and OfficeMax, completed late last year. Management has made it plain that the merger would produce cost savings by consolidating jobs and closing stores.The pressures businesses face from the growth of online retail is another factor that can contribute to store closings. In particular, the rise of Amazon.com, America’s largest e-commerce operation, has turned the entire retail industry on its head.Bookseller Barnes & Noble was one of the first companies to be threatened by Amazon.com, which originally began its operations as an online bookstore. Online retailers, Amazon.com chief among them, accounted for 44% of book sales in 2012 according to Bowker, a bookseller consultancy. Many of these sales came at Barnes & Noble’s expense, as the company’s own e-book business has languished.Staples is a more recent example of a company pressured by Amazon.com. Following two years of sales declines, the office supply retailer announced that it will close 225 stores by 2015, 12% of it’s total store count.Outside of those retailers undergoing mergers, or shrinking to limit costs and preserve their bottom lines, a number of retailers have had to shrink their store count in order to shift into new markets. Companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Aeropostale have are now competing with fast-fashion competitors such as H&M and Forever 21, which specialize in getting the latest trends from the runway to stores quickly and at low prices.Companies close stores for different reasons. In the case of Sears Holdings, is likely to shutter a number of locations as part of a larger strategic overhaul to fund its transformation and make operations more efficient. Closing stores “frees up capital, reduces losses and de-risks our model,” the company said in an earnings presentation.In contrast, J.C. Penney is only closing stores that noticeably underperformed. The company’s sales have fallen sharply since Ron Johnson, previously Apple’s retail chief, took over as CEO nearly three years ago, and continue to have fallen since he was ousted by the board last year. But the company continues to make major investments in its conventional brick-and-mortar operations, and has only announced the closing of 33 out of more than 1,000 stores.To determine the retailers closing the most stores, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed large retailers that have publicly announced store closings for 2014, or are in the middle of a multi-year plan to trim locations. In addition, we also reviewed company earnings and SEC filings.These are the retailers closing the most stores, according to 24/7 Wall St.: "

Gates seemed critical of the price Facebook paid for its recent acquisition. “Fifty years ago, no 55-person company was bought for $19 billion. And that’s a good thing,” he told host George Stephanopoulos.As for what the acquisition suggests about Zuckerberg himself, Gates said, “It’s an example of how he’s an out-of-the-box thinker. He’s aggressive. I hope it works out for him. Not everybody would’ve done it, I’ll say that for sure.”The Microsoft founder had earlier discussed the deal in an in-depth interview with Rolling Stone magazine ""I think his aggressiveness is wise -- although the price is higher than I would have expected,"" Gates said. He called Zuckerberg ""more of a product manager"" than he ever was. Besides the high price, the Facebook-WhatsApp deal has also been controversial because of the companies' opposing takes on privacy. WhatsApp, which boasts nearly a half-billion users, has prided itself on collecting as little information about those users as possible, while Facebook is notorious for invading its users' privacy.""People need to differentiate us from companies like Yahoo! and Facebook that collect your data and have it sitting on their servers. We want to know as little about our users as possible,"" WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum said in a Wired interview before the acquisition.Zuckerberg has promised that Facebook won't interfere with the way WhatsApp operates.

7,QUEER VOICES,The 'Hidden Gay Agenda' Movie Test,"Domenick Scudera, Contributor

Applied to any number of movie classics, this test proves to be enlightening.",2014-03-15,"This image released by Disney shows, from left, Anna, voiced by Kristen Bell, Olaf, voiced by Josh Gad, and Kristoff, voiced by Jonathan Groff in a scene from the animated feature ""Frozen."" (AP Photo/Disney",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafc4c9210000e700c70598.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There has been much speculation of late from conservative Christian commentators about a ""hidden homosexual agenda"" in the animated Disney film Frozen. The theories go something like this: In Frozen, one of the characters has a hidden power that she tries to suppress, but ultimately she learns to accept it. This is a metaphor for the homosexual agenda, the conservative theorists theorize, because initially her power (her secret quality) is hidden from the rest of the world, but eventually she learns to accept this part of herself, and she ""comes out,"" so to speak. These theories were quickly lambasted by critics as ridiculous and far-fetched. But let's not be too hasty. If we take the theories seriously, there may be some value in them. If we apply the same reasoning to other films, we may discover that Hollywood has been pushing a secret gay agenda for decades.I have developed a ""hidden gay agenda"" movie test using the logic of the conservatives who are criticizing Frozen. Applied to any number of movie classics, this test proves to be enlightening.The test is simple. There must be three elements in a film for it to have a hidden gay agenda:1. The main character possesses a quality that is different from everyone else, and...2. ...the quality is hidden or suppressed until...3. ...the quality is accepted and/or celebrated. Let's put some films through the test to determine whether or not they contain a hidden gay agenda!The Wizard of Oz1. Dorothy has special powers in her ruby-red slippers, and...2. ...those powers remain hidden until...3. ...she embraces their ability to take her home.Result: This is a no-brainer. The Wizard of Oz has a huge hidden gay agenda. Duh. The message is: ""There's no place like gay.""The Ten Commandments1. Moses is a Jew who is raised as an Egyptian prince, and...2. ...his Jewishness is hidden for years, until...3. ...he accepts who he is and leads all the Jews out of Egypt.Result: Strong hidden gay agenda. The half-naked, oiled-up men in skirts put this one over the top. It is a wonder that Christian conservatives allow their children to read the Bible with the presence of this strong gay undercurrent.The Sound of Music1. Maria is a nun who harbors a secret love for Captain Von Trapp, and...2. ...her love remains suppressed during hours and hours of singing, until...3. ...she learns to ""climb ev'ry mountain."" She returns to embrace her love. A huge celebratory wedding ensues.Result: Hidden gay agenda. Admittedly, Maria and Captain Von Trapp are heterosexual, but there are tons of subtle gay messages throughout. The lonely goatherd is probably gay. Lyrics like ""raindrops on roses, and whiskers on kittens"" are pretty darn gay. And Rolfe? He wears lederhosen and rejects Liesl. C'mon.Star Wars1. Luke Skywalker discovers that he is a descendant of a great Jedi, and...2. ...his connection with the Force remains largely untapped until...3. ...he embraces the Force and destroys the Death Star.Result: As Yoda would say, strong the hidden gay agenda is. Luke's embrace of the Force evens earns him a medal from Princess Leia.Carrie1. Carrie is telekinetic, and...2. ...she tries to suppress her telekinesis, until...3. ...her classmates drop a bucket of blood on her at the prom. Then she fully embraces her powers, lets loose and maims or kills just about everybody in her path.Result: Terrifyingly full of a gay agenda. How do straight people even watch this movie? When Carrie unleashes her powers, the results are violent and turn out horribly for the normal (straight) people. Perhaps it is palatable to heterosexual audiences because -- SPOILER ALERT! -- Carrie ends up dead. Or does she?Brokeback Mountain1. The main character, Ennis, is gay in a seriously heterosexual environment, and...2. ...he keeps his homosexuality a secret, until...3. ...well, actually, he never accepts or celebrates his homosexuality.Result: Since condition 3 is not met, there is no hidden gay agenda in this film. It has an overt gay agenda and does not require a hidden one.The Harry Potter movies1. Harry Potter discovers that he is the child of a wizarding family, and...2. ...his connection with his wizard powers remain largely untapped until...3. ...he learns to use his powers and destroys Voldemort.Result: Wait, isn't this the same plot as Star Wars? Whether it is or not, it is gay, gay, gay.Some of these films are favorites of mine. I have seen them multiple times. No wonder I ended up gay. Hollywood's hidden homosexual agenda is working!Take the test with your favorite films. What other movies have a hidden gay agenda?"
