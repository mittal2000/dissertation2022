The one thing I've noticed with all of my clients who are successful in creating major positive change is their willingness to recognize negative self-talk.This is the one thing that is essential in generating authentic and sustainable positive change no matter what your goal is. Acknowledging negative thoughts, beliefs and feelings is the pre-cursor to fixing it, with an eventual outcome of reversing those beliefs and replacing them with positive and truthful self-talk. We all have adverse thoughts. It is normal. But it also gets in our way of achieving all that we can, being happier, and living life to the fullest. In order to put those thoughts and attitudes to rest, they must be observed and ultimately confronted. Addressing negative thoughts is the genuine catalyst to constructive improvements in mood, outlook and more. When you understand where the skepticism is coming from, you become more empowered. From time to time, I see clients get stuck on the 'observing negative self-talk step' for several reasons. The most popular reasons being that they are embarrassed to say out loud what they say to themselves; and/or because they are reluctant to put energy toward negativity. Logically, these are good arguments. Even if you have a trusted relationship with a life coach, family member, friend, etc. - it's a scary experience to let someone know what you're really thinking about yourself and your ambitions. As for the second argument - who wants to hire a life coach that focuses on negativity, right? I explain the process like this: you must pull the weeds before you plant the flowers! To pulverize those 'weeds', let's look at the source of the negative self-talk. There is a purpose and reason for all of it whether the inner antagonism is validated or not. Perhaps the thoughts come from fear, sadness, worry, protection, or other feelings. Or maybe it's programmed in your brain from specific outside influences such as unsupportive people, bad experiences, entertainment sources, or elsewhere. Initially, identifying those disapproving thoughts or beliefs can be tough. They are slippery little suckers ingrained in us from a lifetime of experiences. But once you catch one of those thoughts, it is your duty to acknowledge it and challenge it. You may find that most of your negative self-talk is untrue and possibly habitual. If that is the case, you can work to change that habit just like you would diminish any other habit. Extinguish it altogether, or - probably more logical in this case - replace the false pessimistic thinking with positive and beneficial statements. Sometimes you may find that the bad self-talk is true or has the potential to come true. The key here is to not give the power to the negative part or lie to yourself with a blissfully optimistic declaration. The solution would be to find and capitalize the positive part of the experience you're feeling down about. There is always something constructive you can bring your attention to, even if it's not the part of the experience you hoped would be great. Find that positivity and create an effective mantra that will combat that mean little self-talk gremlin!As you become more aware of your thoughts and gain strength in empowering the positive side, you too will eventually notice an improved mood and outlook that will manifest more fulfillment!"

Iran's supreme leader underwent prostate surgery on Monday at a government hospital in Tehran, state media said in a rare report on the state of health of the country's top cleric. The 75-year-old, who has final say on all state matters in Iran and has been the country's top leader since 1989, was reported to be recovering.(AP Photo/Office of the Supreme Leader)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc148c82400004f0024fc0c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whereas the international focus today is on how to counter violent extremism, which is behind many of the violent conflicts sweeping the Middle East, the real destabilizing power and sponsor of terrorism in the region and beyond is Iran. Unlike violent extremists and religious fanatics such as the Islamic State (IS), which can be degraded and even destroyed, the same cannot be said about Iran. Tehran continues to export its revolutionary zeal by supporting terrorism and radical organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah, providing direct financial and military assistance to radical Shiite militias, and maintaining through subversive activities its strong hold on Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon.In an effort to convert Yemen into another Iranian satellite in the Arabian Peninsula, Iran was quick to exploit the war-torn country by providing logistical support, money, and military hardware to the Shiite-leaning Houthis.Iran, whose ambition is to become the region's hegemon, is gradually consolidating its gains and firmly progressing toward achieving its national objective by whatever means, including the use of force, insurrection, and terrorism.Given Iran's long, rich history of magnificent past achievements, as well as its natural resources, geographic location, enlightened population, and still-untapped potential, one would think that Iran would have chosen to project ""soft power"" to achieve its desired regional prominence.The mullahs, however, chose a different path because they recognize their own shortcomings as a revolutionary regime that lacks a defined national identity, and as a predominantly Shiite state suspected and even reviled by Sunnis in the region and beyond.In addition, fearful of regime change and concerned about an organized domestic opposition that would attempt to overthrow the regime, the mullahs concluded that Iran's revolutionary zeal is the only path that will secure its foothold in the region.Given the inherent animosity and distrust between the Shiites and Sunnis that was revived in the wake of the 2003 Iraq war, the mullahs know that they will be rejected by the Arab world and their brand of revolution will not be acceptable.This also explains why Iran, with or without a final agreement on its nuclear program, remains committed to acquiring nuclear weapons to deter other powers from attacking it and also be in a position to subordinate other states in the area.Moreover, because of Iran's desire to distract the attention of the international community from its mischiefs, it has systematically exacerbated regional conflicts not only in its immediate vicinity (Bahrain, Yemen) but further away, especially the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.In sum, in spite of the economic hardships and domestic and international pressure, the Iranian regime hijacked the country's human and material resources in its effort to become a regional powerhouse. Tehran will simply not stop exploiting every opportunity and using heinous means to achieve its objectives unless confronted by major players in and outside the region.To understand how far Iran would go, its constitution says it all. The preamble states that it ""shall pave the way for the perpetuation of the Islamic revolution within and outside the country ... [and seek] to lay the ground for the creation of a single world nation ... the army will be entrusted with the task not only protecting and preserving our borders, but also an ideological mission ... Jihad in the name of God and the world.""Although President Obama's eagerness to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is admirable, the fact that the ""Parameters for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"" regarding Iran's nuclear program, which was just concluded in Lausanne, is not linked to Iran's threatening behavior is troubling, as Iran will continue to feed into the region's violent turmoil.It is understandable that because of domestic opposition, national pride and what would have been interpreted as indirect admission of its subversive activity, Tehran adamantly refused to link the easing of the sanctions to anything else but the nuclear program.That said, Iran cannot have it both ways. There is no better time for the U.S. to insist quietly that the extent and the speed of easing the sanctions will be linked not only to Iran's compliance to the provisions of the agreement but to its behavior.The Arab states, which recently announced the formation of a unified Arab military force, must now demonstrate their capability to form robust, combat-ready forces, equipped with the most modern military hardware that can be projected anywhere to deal with any threat in the Middle East.Iran will take such a military force seriously only if the joint command demonstrates the resolve and credibility to engage any enemy, including Iran, to prevent encroachments into Arab territory.Saudi Arabia, which is engaged in a proxy war against Iran in both Syria and Iraq, made an extremely important strategic move to bomb Houthi encampments in Yemen. This was necessary and timely to send a clear warning to Iran that the Arab states will not tolerate its continued infringement and are intent to stop it.The European Union, which is eager to resume business with Iran once the agreement on its nuclear program is finalized, must also link future business contracts, purchases, and transport of Iranian crude oil and gas to Iran's behavior.The EU and the U.S. must insist that Iran, which has tremendous leverage on the Assad regime, modify its stance on Syria and play a constructive role to assist in bringing a political solution to end the tragic civil war. By being part of the solution, Iran can maintain -- if not strengthen -- its influence in Syria.Having a common strategic interest to check Iran's regional intrusion and blunt its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons, Israel and the Arab states should continue to share intelligence and even collaborate if directly threaten by Iran.The nuclear deal may in fact embolden Iran to continue its subversive activities. But it can also allow Iran to turn a page in its relations with the international community and harness its huge human and material resources to become a constructive player on the global stage."
3,POLITICS,"Gay Rights, Religious Freedom and the Moral Arc","Michael Shermer, ContributorFounding publisher, Skeptic magazine; editor, Skeptic.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gay-rights-religious-freedom-and-the-moral-arc_b_7000132.html,"The arc of the moral universe is bending toward justice for gays and lesbians faster than any moral rights revolution in history, as evidenced this week in Indiana.",2015-04-03,2015-04-03-1428074121-8336765-MoralArcdeepgraymetallic.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-03-1428074121-8336765-MoralArcdeepgraymetallic-thumb.jpg," My friends Jürgen and Heiko, whom I met through my German wife Jennifer, wed in Germany. In many European countries same-sex marriage is non-controversial. How long will it take for America to catch up to Europe's respect for human rights? Not long, because the arc of the moral universe is bending toward justice for gays and lesbians faster than any moral rights revolution in history, as evidenced this week in Indiana.The collision between ""religious freedom"" laws that allow discrimination against targeted groups like gays and the expanding moral sphere that has led to more tolerance over the past half century were on display in Indiana and elsewhere this week. The fact that the issue involves ""religious"" freedom tells us the source of those who still resist the right for everyone to be treated equally under the law, and for all people to enjoy the fruits of liberty as protected in the Constitution. Religion. It is religion more than anything else that keeps people from wanting others to have the same rights as they do. It is religion that needs reform, and along with it religious people's attitudes toward others who differ from them. Note the words of Martin Luther King's daughter Bernice King, a Baptist minister: ""My father did not take a bullet for same-sex marriage.""It takes religion to get someone to speak such words that, in fact, contradict those of her father, as noted in this quote from Coretta Scott King:""I still hear people say that I should not be talking about the rights of lesbian and gay people and I should stick to the issue of racial justice. But I hasten to remind them that Martin Luther King Jr. said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' I appeal to everyone who believes in Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream to make room at the table of brother and sisterhood for lesbian and gay people.""Since Saturday (April 4) marks the anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and last month was the 50th anniversary of King's famous march from Selma to Montgomery, here is a brief summary of that momentous event and what it means for us today, from the Prologue to my new book, The Moral Arc: How Science and Reason Lead Humanity Toward Truth, Justice, and Freedom.On Sunday, March 21st, 1965, about 8,000 people gathered at Brown Chapel in Selma, Alabama and began a march to the capitol building in Montgomery. At the front of the crowd was the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and they were marching for one reason. Justice. They wanted simply to be given the right to vote. They had tried to march twice before, but were met with tear gas, billy clubs, and rubber tubing wrapped in barbed wire. And both times they were forced to turn back. But not this time. This time President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to protect the marchers. And so for five days, over a span of 53 miles, through biting cold and frequent rain, they marched. Word spread, the number of demonstrators grew, and by the time they reached the capitol building on March 25, their numbers had swelled to at least 25,000.  From the back of a flatbed truck parked in front of the steps to the state capitol Dr. King delivered his stirring anthem to freedom. He asked, rhetorically, ""How long will prejudice blind the visions of men, darken their understanding, and drive bright-eyed wisdom from her sacred throne?"" And ""How long will justice be crucified and truth bear it?"" In response, Dr. King offered words of counsel, comfort, and assurance, saying that no matter the obstacles it wouldn't be long before freedom was realized because, he said, ""truth crushed to earth will rise again,"" ""no lie can live forever,"" and ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."" It was one of the greatest speeches in the history of public oratory. And it worked. Less than five months later, on August 6th, 1965, President Johnson signed the voting rights act into law. It was just as Dr. King had said--the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice.  Does it still bend in the right direction? It's hard to watch the news and not think otherwise, but as President Bill Clinton cautioned in a recent speech, we should follow the trend lines, not the headlines.  When we do so we can see improvements in the domain of morality evident in many areas of life. Governance: the rise of liberal democracies and the decline of theocracies and autocracies. Economics: broader property rights and the freedom to trade goods and services with others without oppressive restrictions. Rights: to life, liberty, property, marriage, reproduction, voting, speech, worship, assembly, protest, autonomy, and the pursuit of happiness. Prosperity: the explosion of wealth and increasing affluence for more people and the decline of poverty worldwide. War: a smaller percentage of people die as a result of violent conflict today than at any time since our species began. Slavery: outlawed everywhere in the world. Homicide: rates have fallen precipitously from over 100 murders per 100,000 people in the Middle Ages to less than 1 per 100,000 today in the Industrial West. Judicial restraint: torture and the death penalty have been almost universally outlawed by states. Judicial equality: citizens are treated more equally under the law than any time in the past. And civility: people are kinder, more civilized, and less violent to one another than ever before. What is the cause of this moral progress? Most people associate it with religion, but in fact I believe that most of the moral development of the past several centuries has been the result of societies moving toward more secular forms of governance and politics, law and jurisprudence, moral reasoning and ethical analysis. Over time it has become less acceptable to argue that my beliefs, morals, and ways of life are better than yours simply because they are mine, or because they are traditional, or because my religion is better than your religion, or because my God is the One True God and yours is not.  It is no longer acceptable to simply assert your moral beliefs; you have to provide reasons for them, and those reasons had better be grounded in rational arguments and empirical evidence or else they will likely be ignored or rejected.   Historically, we can look back and see that we have been steadily--albeit at times haltingly--expanding the moral sphere to include more members of our species as legitimate participants in the moral community. The burgeoning conscience of humanity has grown to the point where we no longer consider the wellbeing only of our family, extended family, and local community; rather, our consideration now extends to people quite unlike ourselves, with whom we gladly trade goods and ideas and exchange sentiments and genes, rather than beating, enslaving, raping, or killing them.  Gay rights and same-sex marriage is a prime example. A decade ago almost everyone was against it. A decade from now virtually everyone will be for it. And we will look back at our current debates like we now reflect on the inanity of arguments from decades ago in favor of black-and-white drinking fountains and against interracial marriage.  We have many social and moral problems left to solve, to be sure, and the direction of the arc will hopefully continue upwards long after our epoch so we are by no means at the apex, but there is much evidence to support the fact that Dr. King was right--the arc of the moral universe really does bend toward justice.***To read more on the bending of the moral arc and the expanding of the moral sphere order your copy of The Moral Arc today."

That prompted fears that businesses would use the law to legally refuse service to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender customers. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) insisted that the legislation was never intended to shield such discrimination, but the public backlash mounted. On Thursday, state lawmakers added language establishing that the law does not authorize businesses to refuse service on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Critics, however, said the fix was too weak and called for Indiana to pass comprehensive nondiscrimination protections. Fiorina, whose criticism of Cook echoes that of other conservative commentators, told The Wall Street Journal that she found nothing objectionable in the original bill that Pence signed last week. While she has stopped short of endorsing same-sex marriage, she said last week that same-sex couples bound by civil unions should receive equal government benefits."

It also happens to be a great place to work. The chain received strong reviews across the board for the freshness its products, from vegetables and meats to bakery items and prepared foods. CEO Danny Wegman credits the company's employees for these results.“A big thank you goes to our employees,"" CEO Danny Wegman said in a statement. ""Results like these are only possible because of our people and because we are paying attention to the things that matter most to our customers.""For a relatively small chain with just 85 stores, Wegmans does a stellar job of taking care of its workers. It recently edged out Amazon to earn the top ranking for company reputation, and it’s known for offering school scholarships and other benefits to its employees. It also dedicates resources to ensuring its workers move up the ladder: 66 percent of its promotions are internal.Consumer Reports' supermarket rankings come from an annual survey, which received nearly 63,000 reader responses on 68 chains. Wegmans was voted number one last year, as well.Publix and Trader Joe’s rounded out the top three supermarkets in overall score, though they fell behind in produce freshness. The only other two chains that earned top marks for freshness were The Fresh Market and Whole Foods.Warehouse stores like BJ’s, Target, Walmart and Sam’s Club got below-average ratings on produce freshness and sat in the bottom half of the list. But Costco fared better, with sixth place overall and an average ranking for produce quality.Whole Foods is known for having a strong benefits program, with even part-time employees eligible for insurance. Workers can also earn rewards for productivity at work.Costco also treats its employees well: they earn around 40 percent more than staff at competitor chains. And at Trader Joe's, the starting pay for a full-time worker is between $40,000 and $60,000 a year, more than double the salary at some other stores.Retail giants like Walmart and Target, however, have been continuously lambasted by critics and labor unions for their low wages. Under growing pressure, they are among a number of retailers that have moved to increase hourly wages in recent months.Clarification: Language has been added to specify that the starting pay range at Trader Joe's stated above is for full-time employees, not all employees."

Courtesy of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, New York""Once upon a time"" is a phrase we use for fairy tales and fables. Yet most Jews carry with them another time, another land, another city. It could be the Pale of Settlement or Vilnius, Krakow or Lvov or, in more recent times, the Lower East Side, the Bronx, Tehran, Moscow, Buenos Aires or even the Tel Aviv that once was. Perhaps in the future we will say the same for Paris, Manchester or Copenhagen. Quien Sabe?  That feeling of being in two places, two time periods, at once, is part of the experience of ""Letters to Afar,"" a remarkable exhibit on view through May 24 at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco (CJM), a video and sound installation by Hungarian artist Péter Forgács that combines Polish/Jewish ""found footage"" (home movies, travelogues) made between 1918 and 1939 with music by the Klezmatics.""Letters to Afar"" is installed in the upper-floor galleries of the CJM's Daniel Libeskind-designed building. Films, for the most part taken by American Jews on return visits to Poland, each from different Polish cities, including Warsaw, Krakow, Grodek, Lodz and Vilna, are projected onto the walls of the darkened galleries, or onto multiple scrims, which endow the imagery with a ghostly presence, sometimes doubling the films horizontally, so that the same film is shown twice but not always showing the same images at the same time, or in different magnifications; or three films stacked vertically -- forcing us to compare, contrast and take in the complex multiple details of each lost world. The installation is austere, the effect contemplative, reverential -- the effect is not ""we are there"" so much as to create the feeling that we, in the here and now, are drifting through some limbo of past Jewish experience. There are benches and pinpoints of light where one can stand and listen -- at times to klezmer strains, at others to atonal, ambient, classical or dissonant sounds. Occasionally, we hear narration of the travelogues on view. Some of the films include identifying text, most do not. The exhibition has no set unfolding. Rather, visitors are meant to wander about freely and see what they can (to see all the film being projected would take an estimated six hours). The entire installation is one artwork, ""a composition ... one total installation where all elements of different films are in interaction with each other,"" Forgács said. ""We wanted to create this immense richness of life that was crushed.""We look at the faces, some of which look contemporary, others from the past, and still others appear as if unchanged from shtetl life centuries ago. We don't know these people, and yet we feel we do. For example, I experienced a ""Back to the Future"" time-travel shock in seeing on film Max Weinreich, the YIVO's founder in 1935 at its headquarters in Vilna -- a person and a place I had read about but never in my wildest dreams imagined being able to see. It was surreal. As Forgács explained in an interview, ""The hidden history is on the films."" As these are home movies or educational or travel films, the images are pedestrian, of everyday life. ""There are no home movies about divorce or heart attacks,"" he said. His work is not meant as ""an informative documentary."" Instead, Forgács is trying to create an encounter with ""the gestures, the winking, the smile, the movements ... the silent emotions that we read and [that make us] aware of these beautiful things."" In his work, Forgács creates the context and the drama. ""I like operas, not documentaries,"" he said, describing his films as attempts to ""slow down time.""""My work,"" Forgács said, ""is much more than my words.""Forgács was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1950. Since 1978 he has made more than 30 films and is best known for his series ""Private Hungary,"" which recontextualized Hungarian home movies from the 1930s and '60s -- showing private lives that we know will be subsumed by the tsunami of European history, one that occurs, as Forgács put it, ""off screen.""In 1983, Forgács established the Private Photo & Film Archives (PPFA), a collection of amateur film footage from the 1920s. Angelenos may recall the artist from his 2002 multimedia installation at the Getty Research Institute, ""The Danube Exodus: Rippling Currents of the River."" That project, made in collaboration with Marcia Kinder and the Labyrinth Project at USC, contrasted film of Slovakian Jews aboard a ship trying to escape to Palestine with a later ship of Bessarabian Germans trying to flee the Soviets.""Letters to Afar"" came about, Forgács recounted, by a confluence of fortunate circumstances. He received a phone call from Frank London of the Klezmatics suggesting they collaborate on a project involving a collection of films at YIVO, the aforementioned Jewish cultural preservation society now housed in New York (and where London's fellow Klezmatic Lorin Sklamberg has worked since 1987). Steven Spielberg's Righteous Persons Foundation funded the collection's digitization. The next stroke of luck was when the Polin Museum of the History of Polish Jews agreed to commission the work, focusing on Polish Jews during Poland's Second Republic from 1918 to 1938, the period during which a Polish democratic state was created, and Jews, who were granted civil rights, flourished until the Nazi invasion on Sept. 1, 1939.The Galicia Museum is responsible for a related exhibit presently on view at the CJM, ""Poland and Palestine: Two Lands and Two Skies,"" a collection of 50 images from a discovered trove of 15,000 images made in the 1930s by Ze'ev Aleksandrowicz, which is displayed just outside the entrance to ""Letters to Afar."" Its presence adds to the feeling of being in two places (or more) at once.In ""Letters to Afar,"" Forgács has created a memory play. The past, ours and that of the Jews in ""Afar,"" are but threads in the tapestries of our collective consciousness reminding us that, as the Jewish partisans used to say, ""Amchu."" The Jewish people are one and will always be, although not always in the places we used to be.""Letters to Afar"" continues at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco through May 24.

""Inmates and guards at [Texas Department of Criminal Justice] prisons are regularly subjected to extremely high temperatures and humidity levels resulting from Texas summertime conditions and the lack of air conditioning and adequate ventilation in TDCJ facilities.""Last year the Human Rights Clinic released a report detailing the conditions it said it found in the state's prisons. That report also noted that, two years prior, an inmate died from organ failure spurred on by what the clinic said were oppressive heat conditions.TDCJ spokesperson Robert Hurst disputed the new report's findings.""The well-being of staff and offenders is a top priority for the agency and we remain committed to making sure that both are safe during the extreme heat,"" Hurst said in a statement. ""TDCJ takes precautions to help reduce heat–related illnesses such as providing water and ice to staff and offenders in work and housing areas, restricting offender activity during the hottest parts of the day, and training staff to identify those with heat related illnesses and refer them to medical staff for treatment.""Hurst also listed several measures taken by the TDCJ to lower temperatures, including providing fans to inmates, allowing them to wear shorts and providing additional showers for prisoners ""when feasible.""But the report said these remedies are inadequate or are not being effectively implemented.While it's true, for example, that Texas prisons do provide ice, one inmate said the ice is sometimes dirty and filled with mosquitos. And though staff is supposed to deliver ice to inmates' cells, this isn't always done, the report found.The report also said providing fans for inmates isn't enough:Centers for Disease Control has declared such measures ineffective in preventing heat-related injuries in certain hot and humid conditions. Specifically, the CDC found that while fans may increase comfort when temperatures are below 90 degrees [Fahrenheit], they will not protect against heatstroke when temperatures exceed 90 degrees and humidity exceeds 35 percent. Conditions in Texas regularly exceed these levels.Inmates also disputed Hurst's claim that they were offered more showers during the hotter months.Prisoner Freddie Fountain told the clinic that staff at his unit “absolutely does not allow any such extra showers.”Ultimately, the report insists, the TDCJ must dramatically increase ventilation and install air conditioners.Hurst said the price of doing so is too high.""Although a detailed cost analysis has not been done, retrofitting facilities with air conditioning would be extremely expensive,"" Hurst said. ""It should be noted that medical, psychiatric and geriatric units are air conditioned."" Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter |   Contact The Author"
8,POLITICS,Some Atlanta Educators Just Learned A Cynical Lesson About Accountability In America,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/atlanta-educator-cheating-scandal_n_7001214.html,,2015-04-03,"Donald Bullock, left, former Atlanta Public Schools Usher-Collier Heights Elementary testing coordinator, is led to a holding cell after a jury found him guilty in the Atlanta Public Schools test-cheating trial, Wednesday, April 1, 2015, in Atlanta. Bullock and 10 other former Atlanta Public Schools educators accused of participating in a test cheating conspiracy that drew nationwide attention were convicted Wednesday of racketeering charges. (AP Photo/Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Kent D. Johnson, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f12b3c000032000e010a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It isn't every day that people who abuse their positions of authority are held accountable for wrongdoing. Actually, to be statistically precise about it, it isn't any day that happens, really. But there is some good news on that front, for a change: This week, in an Atlanta courtroom, some malefactors finally got nailed.Per the Associated Press:A group of former Atlanta educators convicted in a test cheating scandal were locked up in jail Thursday as they await sentences that could send them to prison for years.Yes, that's right, in the most recent scandal of its kind, a group of educators, including one principal and a number of school administrators, were caught altering the results of one of those daffy standardized tests that now subsume the lion's share of all pedagogical opportunities in America's public schools. Only this time, some are saying that this is a huge story and the biggest development in American education law since forever.From AP again:""This is a huge story and absolutely the biggest development in American education law since forever,"" University of Georgia law professor Ron Carlson said. ""It has to send a message to educators here and broadly across the nation. Playing with student test scores is very, very dangerous business.""There's really no doubt that those convicted did a Very Bad Thing -- like, you know, The Worst Thing ""since forever"" OMG -- if for no other reason than that their actions will scandalize other public school educators, who are currently described so frequently in media accounts as ""embattled"" it's like their homeric epithet. The only people more demonized by political elites from either party are sadists who attempt to set up demented death-cult caliphates. And sweet fancy Moses, did they ever lay the wood to those folks they convicted! Per the AP: ""Over objections from the defendants' attorneys, Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter ordered all but one of those convicted immediately jailed while they await sentencing. They were led out of court in handcuffs.""They took them out in chains! That's hardcore. That's humiliating. That's a sight that will make other people think twice before committing similar crimes -- it's what real accountability looks like.Or at least that's what a horrifyingly unequal justice system looks like when it plays out right before our eyes. Last year The New Yorker took a close look at the teachers and administrators involved in this scandal and, well, read the story for yourself and decide whether these are people who should be shackled; or if, rather, society should apologize for creating the terrible circumstances into which they and their students were thrown. So while an Atlanta judge somehow found the courage to lock these educators up even before they've been sentenced -- again, not a thing that happens to white-collar criminals (with an emphasis there on ""white"") -- the justice system typically has little appetite for such accountability. These educators stumbled into one of the few areas of American life where a willingness to lower the proverbial boom on a corrupt actor actually exists.Let me give you a blueprint for how this sort of thing would have gone down if the scofflaws were high-flying bankers. What if you had a situation where, say -- I don't know -- a big bank laundered money for drug cartels and aided and abetted the transfer of funds between rogue nations and terrorist organizations.This is an actual thing that an actual bank -- HSBC -- actually did. They broke the sort of laws that, had someone like you or I done the same, we would be lucky to avoid being flayed alive in the town square for it.But when an organization like HSBC gets caught engaged in these sorts of crimes, what happens next is that the authorities tasked with meting out accountability invoke something called ""collateral consequences.""Collateral consequences is an idea that Attorney General Eric Holder laid out near the end of a famous memo that everyone initially thought was going to be a new, punitive guideline to disciplining bad banks. But ""collateral consequences"" encapsulates this notion that the state has much more important things to consider than ""holding people accountable for their actions.""From that memo:In the corporate context, prosecutors may take into account the possibly substantial consequences to a corporation's employees, investors, pensioners, and customers, many of whom may, depending on the size and nature of the corporation and their role in its operations, have played no role in the criminal conduct, have been unaware of it, or have been unable to prevent it.As a theoretical construct, this is fairly reasonable -- don't wreck the innocent on your way to punishing the guilty. But the way this precept has been applied has been much different. As Dealbook's Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported, it's the principle that got HSBC largely off the hook: ""State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world's largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.""As punishment for directly aiding some of the world's most noteworthy sociopaths, HSBC was forced to pay $1.9 billion in restitution. That sounds like a big number! But bear in mind that this penalty amounted to ""little more than half of the $3.5 billion in pre-tax profits the bank earned in the third quarter of 2012,"" and just a sliver of the $16.8 billion the bank netted in 2011. HSBC also earned a deferred prosecution deal (where you don't get prosecuted as long as you super-duper promise to stop laundering money for drug cartels and terrorists), and was made to apologize. ""Our bad,"" said the bank's spokesperson, probably.As Reuters reported, former U.S. Treasury official and University of Notre Dame Law professor Jimmy Gurule said that this settlement made ""a mockery of the criminal justice system,"" and recommended that HSBC be subject to the same sort of treatment as these Atlanta educators:In his view, the only way to really catch the attention of banks is to indict individuals.But the way we prosecute banks is actually designed to prevent such shockwaves. Matt Taibbi, whose book The Divide offers a thorough filleting of the way ""collateral consequences"" has become a promiscuously dispensed ""Get Out Of Jail Free"" card, explained how this works in an interview with Amy Goodman, ""Of course it makes sense to not always destroy a company if you can avoid it. But what they've done is they've conflated that sometimes-sensible policy with a policy of not going after any individuals for any crimes.""And so you get Lanny Breuer, the Obama administration's alleged point man in holding Wall Street's feet to the fire, telling the New York City Bar Association that he adheres to a strict, ""sit down, you're rocking the boat"" principle:We are frequently on the receiving end of presentations from defense counsel, CEOs, and economists who argue that the collateral consequences of an indictment would be devastating for their client. In my conference room, over the years, I have heard sober predictions that a company or bank might fail if we indict, that innocent employees could lose their jobs, that entire industries may be affected, and even that global markets will feel the effects. Sometimes -- though, let me stress, not always -- these presentations are compelling. In reaching every charging decision, we must take into account the effect of an indictment on innocent employees and shareholders, just as we must take into account the nature of the crimes committed and the pervasiveness of the misconduct. I personally feel that it's my duty to consider whether individual employees with no responsibility for, or knowledge of, misconduct committed by others in the same company are going to lose their livelihood if we indict the corporation. In large multi-national companies, the jobs of tens of thousands of employees can be at stake. And, in some cases, the health of an industry or the markets are a real factor. Those are the kinds of considerations in white collar crime cases that literally keep me up at night, and which must play a role in responsible enforcement.Being too big to jail ""is a good thing,"" to borrow a phrase of Martha Stewart's (who apparently wasn't big enough). Meanwhile, Breuer now works for the people he was supposed to punish, a fine reward for a job well (not) done.In the case of the fraud committed by these Atlanta educators, dogged investigators and prosecutors were allowed to make their case and are now hailed public guardians of justice. In other words, they weren't treated as shabbily as former SEC investigator Gary Aguirre was by his own agency.Once again, here's Taibbi:Aguirre joined the SEC in September 2004. Two days into his career as a financial investigator, he was asked to look into an insider-trading complaint against a hedge-fund megastar named Art Samberg. One day, with no advance research or discussion, Samberg had suddenly started buying up huge quantities of shares in a firm called Heller Financial. ""It was as if Art Samberg woke up one morning and a voice from the heavens told him to start buying Heller,"" Aguirre recalls. ""And he wasn't just buying shares -- there were some days when he was trying to buy three times as many shares as were being traded that day."" A few weeks later, Heller was bought by General Electric -- and Samberg pocketed $18 million.One would imagine that an SEC investigator, provided with evidence of brazen insider trading, would be given the opportunity to make a case. But what happened next will probably not astonish you. Aguirre was sandbagged by his superiors at the SEC and pressured by Morgan Stanley's lawyers -- among them several who'd spun through the revolving door between regulators and the regulated -- to drop the case. When the still-undaunted Aguirre continued anyway, he was dismissed from his job. The happy ending, I guess, is that the government was finally compelled to fork over $755,000 after Aguirre successfully sued for wrongful termination. (Mack was finally deposed by the SEC, conveniently ""days after the five-year statute of limitations on insider trading had expired in the case."")These Atlanta teachers were, astonishingly, prosecuted under Georgia's version of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, the theory being that their actions were not some hasty, sloppy, misguided attempt to save their school from closing, but actually an elaborate criminal enterprise concocted for the purpose of securing teensy bonuses. The invocation of RICO -- which is more often used to bring down dangerous mafia families and much less often on dodgy schemes cooked up in a teachers' lounge with a busted microwave oven -- means that these educators face the prospect of decades-long jail sentences for crimes in which little money was at stake and resulted in the death of nobody. It really is something of a legal coup that prosecutors found it so easy to convince a judge that RICO was appropriate here.Would that RICO could be successfully applied in banking cases! The very proposition is essentially treated as something of a fantasy. Prosecutors are currently attempting to apply RICO to a case in which Bank of America stands accused of ""effectuating a captive reinsurance scheme that defrauded plaintiffs ... and compelled them to fund illegal kickbacks and referral payments in the form of purported reinsurance premiums to Bank of America,"" but it looks like the bank will dodge this on a technicality. It's a pity the prosecutors in that case are unlikely to be as successful as bringing the RICO sledgehammer to bear as those who prosecuted these Atlanta teachers. And those teachers probably rue the fact that they were much easier to prosecute, as well. As ProPublica's Marian Wang describes, standard operating procedure for cases in which regulators actually put together iron-clad cases against Wall Street criminals looks something like: 1) go after the scofflaws with all the skittishness of a newborn kitten, 2) if at all, and 3) at best, secure financial settlements so teensy-tiny that the judge presiding over the case stands up in court and calls you a disgusting, quivering coward. Yes, that happened, too. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who presided over the 2011 case Securities and Exchange Commission v. Citigroup, spent a sizable part of his opinion -- in which he refused to endorse the negotiated settlement -- lambasting the SEC regulators for their long-form imitation of an invertebrate. But while such prosecutorial performances may stand out as gutless in the Southern District of New York, anyone who's spent time near Capitol Hill recognizes it as bog standard. As we've recently learned, if someone like former Rep. Aaron Schock commits the sin of fraudulently applying for a higher mileage reimbursement than that to which he is entitled, suddenly everyone in Washington becomes infused with the courage of Eowyn facing down the Witch-King at the Battle of Pelennor Fields. And yet many of the same, serious people who talked so tough about the representative from Downton Abbey and his misdeeds, also consider it an open question as to whether skeevy financial advisors should be brought to heel for systematically defrauding their clients to feather their own nests. Why, such a move could imperil the entire financial sector of the economy! There could be collateral consequences!In the end, I think that these Atlanta teachers have learned a lesson: Be a banker. Or a polluter. Or run a for-profit education scam. Or snooker people with predatory mortgage agreements. Or rip off people with penny-stock schemes. Or run a college sports cartel. Or create a super PAC. Or ""torture some folks.""Just don't ever change the answers on a standardized test.Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?"
9,POLITICS,California Proposal Could Roll Back Wage Increases For Tens Of Thousands,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-minimum-wage_n_7001182.html,,2015-04-03,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA - 2009: The sun rises on the Transamerica Pyramid and other downtown high-rise buildings in this 2009 San Francisco, California, early morning cityscape photo taken from Nob Hill. (Photo by George Rose/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f12a2100004202c96d94.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story originally appeared on Capital & Main.Capital & Main has confirmed that a proposed California law could upend existing minimum wage laws across the state, potentially rolling back wage increases for tens of thousands of people. If passed, the legislation could invalidate wage hikes approved by voters in some of the state’s largest cities, including San Francisco and Oakland.Assembly Bill 669 is backed by the California Restaurant Association (CRA) and is being championed by Assemblyman Tom Daly, a Democrat from the Orange County city of Anaheim.The legislation’s target is tipped workers – under Daly’s proposal, the minimum wage for workers who receive tips would be capped at $9 if their total hourly compensation, meaning base wage and tips, is $15 an hour or more. If, for example, an Oakland waitress earns that city’s current minimum wage of $12.25 an hour, and additionally makes $3 in hourly tips, her pay will be adjusted downward to $9 an hour plus her $3 in tips.But the legislation would effectively overturn existing local minimum wage laws across California through a preemption clause. The bill would require cities that have enacted minimum wage laws to amend their ordinances, with explicit language stating the laws’ intention to include tipped workers. Otherwise the ordinances would be superseded by the new state statute.In the case of cities such as San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose that raised the minimum wage through a ballot initiative, the wage hikes would be nullified until another initiative with AB 669’s required language on tipped workers was approved by voters.“Even if a city council wants to fix this, the lawyers may tell them they can’t – that only a vote of the people can fix it,” said Andy Kahn, a partner at the Bay Area law firm Davis, Cowell & Bowe. “It’s an outrageous interference with the people’s right to initiative. The burden on localities to have to go back to the ballot is enormous.”The burden on workers could be equally onerous. “All of a sudden workers’ wages could be cut for as long as it takes for there to be an effective new ordinance – and then the restaurant industry could referendize the [new] ordinance, delaying it even further,” said Kahn.While Daly’s efforts to cap wages for tipped employees has received media attention, the retroactive impact of AB 669 has not. The clause in question states, “This section shall preempt local ordinances setting forth a minimum wage in excess of the minimum wage established by this subdivision, to the extent the ordinance is applicable to qualifying tipped employees, unless the ordinance specifically references this section and states the local jurisdiction’s intent to establish a higher minimum wage for qualifying tipped employees.”“It’s a Restaurant Association sneak – what they really want is to preempt legislation,” says veteran labor attorney Margo Feinberg, who has helped draft wage legislation.Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project (NELP), believes that Daly’s bill poses a threat not just to wage increases passed by California cities but in municipalities around the U.S.“This legislation could undo wage hikes approved by voters in any California locality, including those cities that passed increases last year, and would set a dangerous and damaging precedent for local efforts to raise wages and end tip credits across the country,” Owens told Capital & Main.“Charter cities such as San Francisco and Oakland can establish minimum wages higher than the state minimum wage, and the intent of AB 669 is for local governments to continue to have this authority,” said David Miller, Assemblyman Daly’s legislative director, in response to a query. “Discussions are under way and we are considering amendments in order to address this concern and ensure that local governments would not need to amend their laws.”Daly was elected to the California Assembly in 2012, and has already sponsored eight bills that have been signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown. The former mayor of Anaheim has previously come under fire for siding with Republicans on key legislation, such as a bill that would have made it harder for large companies to deny health care coverage to employees. Daly was one of eight Democrats who either voted against the proposed law or abstained – which had the same effect of killing the measure.Daly has received support from some of the state’s largest business interests, including Disney and the California Restaurant Association. Disney is also a major contributor to the National Restaurant Association, one of the most aggressive opponents of minimum wage increases.“It’s déjà vu all over again with the restaurant association,” said NELP’s Owens. “Not only is it trying to escape the obligation every other California employer has to pay their employees the full minimum wage, but now they’re taking a stab at democracy in their sleight-of-hand legislative gimmick to overturn the will of voters in Oakland, Richmond, San Francisco and San Jose, who overwhelmingly passed minimum wage increases fully protecting tipped employees.”"

""Decision-makers should know better than to try and distort our movement's position.""The White House hasn't technically lied about anything. In a March 31 White House blog post reprinted by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Obama advisers Brian Deese and Christy Goldfuss accurately quoted a handful of environmental groups offering praise for parts of the TPP pact. But Deese and Goldfuss didn't quote any of the objections or concerns that those groups also presented, and they ignored the general alarm that other environmental groups have been sounding on the pact for years. (They did link to full versions of the groups' statements, however.) USTR reiterated the green-friendly framing in a tweet linking to the post: USTR did not respond to a request for comment, but several environmental groups did.""The White House took some of their statements and spun them out,"" said Jake Schmidt, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's international program. ""There are a large number of environmental groups that came out pretty clearly and said ... 'What we've seen on TPP doesn't look good.'""Officials from Oceana, the Humane Society, the World Wildlife Fund and World Animal Protection all told HuffPost they had not endorsed the TPP pact and are waiting to see the final agreement before rendering a verdict, although the White House quoted all of these groups praising elements of it.TPP is a massive trade pact between 12 nations that has the potential to affect everything from prescription drug pricing to beef tariffs. The deal is still being negotiated, and the Obama administration is treating its terms and its negotiating texts as classified information, making it difficult for outside organizations to have an informed opinion. Corporate lobbying groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Republican leaders in Congress strongly support the deal, while congressional Democrats are overwhelmingly opposed. TPP's backers say the final deal will boost economic growth, while critics argue that it could exacerbate income inequality and undermine key financial and environmental regulations.The Obama administration's somewhat selective quotations exploit a real divide in the environmentalist community, however. Some animal welfare groups, including those cited in the White House blog, think U.S. proposals to fight trade in illegal wildlife could help curb the market for rhino horns, tiger parts and other poaching products. WWF and World Animal Protection, for instance, may ultimately endorse TPP if the administration lives up to its wildlife protection commitments in the final deal. But green groups that work in a wider policy arena -- Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Earthjustice, Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, Rainforest Action Network, Defenders of Wildlife and many others -- see very big problems in other chapters of the agreement that have leaked to the public.The TPP investment chapter grants multinational companies the political power to challenge domestic laws and regulations before an international tribunal. Green groups worry that environmental standards will soon be targeted, and that polluters will use this power to pressure countries against adopting new rules. Environmentalists are also concerned that the final pact will provide trade preferences to fossil fuels or dangerous chemicals.""Any potential benefits of the environment chapter would be overwhelmed by the destructive effects of other parts of the deal,"" said Ilana Solomon, director of the Sierra Club's Responsible Trade Program. Solomon warned of ""broad new rights to big polluters and [increasing] our dependence on dangerous fossil fuels.""Most trade experts believe President Barack Obama will ultimately need Congress to grant him so-called ""fast-track"" authority in order to pass TPP. Fast-track would preclude filibusters on trade deals, and would bar members of Congress from amending the deal. In January, more than three dozen environmental organizations signed a letter urging members of Congress to oppose fast-track."

Iraqi security forces battled the last remaining pockets of Islamic State militants in Tikrit on Wednesday and were expected to gain full control of the city ""within the coming hours,"" said Iraqi Interior Minister Mohammed Salem al-Ghabban. (AP Photo/Khalid Mohammed)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc148ca2400003600382ad9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TIKRIT, Iraq, April 3 (Reuters) - On April 1, the city of Tikrit was liberated from the extremist group Islamic State. The Shi'ite-led central government and allied militias, after a month-long battle, had expelled the barbarous Sunni radicals.Then, some of the liberators took revenge.Near the charred, bullet-scarred government headquarters, two federal policemen flanked a suspected Islamic State fighter. Urged on by a furious mob, the two officers took out knives and repeatedly stabbed the man in the neck and slit his throat. The killing was witnessed by two Reuters correspondents.The incident is now under investigation, interior ministry spokesman Brigadier General Saad Maan told Reuters.Since its recapture two days ago, the Sunni city of Tikrit has been the scene of violence and looting. In addition to the killing of the extremist combatant, Reuters correspondents also saw a convoy of Shi'ite paramilitary fighters - the government's partners in liberating the city - drag a corpse through the streets behind their car.Local officials said the mayhem continues. Two security officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Friday that dozens of homes had been torched in the city. They added that they had witnessed the looting of stores by Shi'ite militiamen.Later Friday, Ahmed al-Kraim, head of the Salahuddin Provincial Council, told Reuters that mobs had burned down ""hundreds of houses"" and looted shops over the past two days. Government security forces, he said, were afraid to confront the mobs. Kraim said he left the city late Friday afternoon because the situation was spinning out of control.""Our city was burnt in front of our eyes. We can't control what is going on,"" Kraim said.Those reports could not be immediately confirmed.It wasn't supposed to be this way. Islamic State, an Al Qaeda offshoot that arose from the chaos in Iraq and Syria, slaughtered thousands and seized much of northern and central Iraq last year. The government offensive was meant not only to dislodge the group but also to transcend the fundamental divide in fractured Iraq: the enmity between the now-ruling Shi'ite majority and the country's formerly dominant Sunni minority.Officials close to Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, a moderate Shi'ite, had described the Tikrit campaign as a chance to demonstrate his government's independence from one source of its power: Iraqi Shi'ite militias backed by Shi'ite Iran and advised by Iranian military officers. Sunnis deeply mistrust and fear these paramilitaries, accusing them of summary executions and vandalism. But Abadi has had to rely on the Shi'ite militias on the battlefield, as Iraq's regular military deserted en masse last summer in the Islamic State onslaught.The militia groups spearheaded the start of the Tikrit assault in early March. But after two weeks of fighting, Abadi enforced a pause. Asserting his power over the Shi'ite militias, he called in U.S. airstrikes.Now, the looting and violence in Tikrit threaten to tarnish Abadi's victory. It risks signaling to Sunni Iraqis that the central government is weak and not trustworthy enough to recapture other territory held by Islamic State, including the much larger city of Mosul. Tikrit, hometown of the late dictator Saddam Hussein, is in the Sunni heartland of Iraq.At stake is much more than future votes: Islamic State's rapid conquests in 2014 were made possible by support from Sunni tribal forces and ordinary citizens. They were convinced that the government - under Abadi's predecessor, Nuri al-Maliki - viewed their community as terrorists. If Sunnis dislike what they see in Tikrit, they may not back the government's efforts against Islamic State.DEFENDING LIVES AND PROPERTYOn Friday, the government sought to assure all sides that it will enforce order. Abadi issued a statement calling on the security forces to arrest anyone breaking the law.Asked to comment on the scenes witnessed by Reuters, his spokesman Rafid Jaboori said he would not address individual incidents but said: ""People's lives and property are priorities, whether in this operation or in the overall military effort to liberate the rest of Iraq.""Sunni lawmakers who visited Tikrit complained that events have spun out of control since the security forces and militias retook the city.Parliamentarian Mutashar al-Samarrai credited the government with orchestrating a smooth entrance into Tikrit. But he said that some Shi'ite paramilitary factions had exploited the situation. ""I believe this happened on purpose to disrupt the government's achievement in Tikrit,"" Samarrai said. ""This is a struggle between the (paramilitaries) and the government for control.""Neighborhoods entered by the Iraqi forces and Shi'ite paramilitaries have been burnt, including parts of neighboring Dour and Auja, the birthplace of Saddam Hussein.Security forces blame Islamic State for rigging houses with explosives, while Sunnis suspect the Shi'ite militias and the army and police of deliberately torching their homes.Looting has also been a problem. Shi'ite paramilitary fighters in pickup trucks raced through the city carrying goods that appeared to have been looted from homes and government offices.The vehicles were crammed with refrigerators, air conditioners, computer printers, and furniture. A young militia fighter rode on a red bicycle, gleefully shouting: ""I always dreamed of having a bike like this as a kid.""Brigadier General Maan, the main spokesman for the government forces, said police were stopping vehicles that appeared to have stolen items. ""We are doing our best to impose the law.""IRAN'S FINGERPRINTSPassions were running high among the Shi'ite militia groups before the assault. Islamic State beheaded people and carried out other atrocities in the lands it conquered. In particular, the militias wanted revenge for Islamic State's killing in June of hundreds of Iraqi soldiers captured from Camp Speicher, a base near Tikrit. It was an event that came to symbolize the Sunni jihadists' barbarism.Despite Baghdad's efforts to rein in the paramilitaries, the fingerprints of the Shi'ite militias - and of Iran itself - were all over the operation's final hours.On Wednesday, as Tikrit fell, militiamen were racing to stencil their names on houses in order to take credit for the victory.An Iranian fighter, with a Kalashnikov rifle slung over his shoulder and a picture of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pinned to his chest, bragging about Tehran's role in the campaign.""I am proud to participate in the battle to liberate Tikrit,"" said the man, who called himself Sheik Dawood. ""Iran and Iraq are one state now.""On the edge of Tikrit in the hours after the city's fall, a Shi'ite paramilitary group drove in a convoy past several police cars.The militiamen had strung the corpse of a suspected Islamic State fighter from the back of a white Toyota pickup truck. The cable dragging the man snapped, and the vehicle stopped.The men got out to retie the bullet-riddled corpse. As they fastened the cable tighter to the body, a song about their victory over Islamic State played on the truck's stereo. Then they sped off, the corpse kicking up a cloud of dust.The policemen standing nearby did nothing.On Wednesday afternoon, Reuters saw two suspected Islamic State detainees - identified as an Egyptian and a Sudanese national - in a room in a government building. The Egyptian and the Sudanese were then taken outside by police intelligence.Word spread that the two suspected Islamic State prisoners were being escorted out. Federal policemen, who had lost an officer named Colonel Imad the previous day in a bombing, flocked around the detainees.The interior ministry spokesman, Brigadier Maan, said the Egyptian had stabbed an Iraqi police officer, which explains the anger against him. Reuters couldn't verify that claim.""WE WANT TO AVENGE OUR COLONEL""The two prisoners were put in the back of a pickup truck. As the vehicle tried to leave, the crowd blocked it.The federal policemen started shouting to the intelligence officers: Hand over the men. The intelligence officers tried to shield the prisoners. One pulled a sidearm as the federal police began swinging their fists.The mob was screaming: ""We want to avenge our Lieutenant Colonel.""Shi'ite paramilitary men swarmed the area. The street filled with more than 20 federal police. Gunfire erupted. Bullets ricocheted. At least one of the Shi'ite fighters was wounded, and began bleeding from the leg.The pickup truck tried to back up. People in the mob grabbed one of the prisoners from the truck, the Egyptian, and pulled him out.The Egyptian sat silently at the feet of two big policemen in their twenties. His eyes filled with fear. He was surrounded by a few dozen people, a mix of federal police and Shi'ite militiamen.""He is Daesh, and we should take revenge for Colonel Imad,"" the two federal police officers yelled, using a derogatory Arabic term for Islamic State.One of the policemen held a black-handled knife with a four-to-five-inch blade. The other gripped a folding knife, with a three-inch blade and a brown handle.They waved their knives in the air, to cheers from the crowd, and chanted: ""We will slaughter him. We will take revenge for Colonel Imad. We will slaughter him.""The policemen laid the Egyptian's head over the curb. Then one of the police pushed the other out of the way and he swung his whole body down, landing the knife into the Egyptian's neck.The cop lifted the knife and thrust the blade in the Egyptian's neck a second time. Blood gushed out, staining the boots of the cheering onlookers.The killer started to saw through the neck, but it was slow-going. He lifted the blade again and slammed it into the Egyptian's neck another four times. Then he sawed back and forth.""BRING ME A CABLE""Their fellow policemen chanted: ""We took revenge for Colonel Imad.""The killer lifted himself up the street pole next to the dying man so he could address his comrades: ""Colonel Imad was a brave man. Colonel Imad didn't deserve to die at the hands of dirty Daesh. This is a message to Colonel Imad's family don't be sad, raise your heads.""Then he shouted: ""Let's tie the body to the pole so everyone can see. Bring a cable. Bring a cable.""His friend with the folding knife kept trying to stab the Egyptian, with no success. He cried out: ""I need a sharp knife. I want to behead this dirty Daesh.""Finally the men found a cable, fastened it to the dead man's feet and dangled him from the pole.One policeman grew upset at the spectacle and shouted: ""There are dozens of media here. This is not the suitable time. Why do you want to embarrass us?""The mob ignored him and continued trying to hoist the body. White bone stuck out from his slashed neck, his head flopped from side to side, and the blood continued to gush forth.

""In our own country, we can continue our march toward a more perfect union. Around the world, we can seek to extend the miracles of freedom and peace, prosperity and security, to more of God’s creation.""Obama shared his regards with families celebrating Passover in the United States, the state of Israel and around the world.In a statement released later Friday, Obama said he looks forward to standing ""with those around the world who are persecuted for their faith"" on Easter.Read the president's statement on Easter below: Michelle and I join our fellow Christians around the world in observing Good Friday and celebrating Easter this weekend. With humility and awe, we give thanks for the extraordinary sacrifice that Jesus made for our salvation. We rejoice in the triumph of the Resurrection. And we renew our commitment to live as He commanded – to love God with all our heart, soul and mind, and to love our neighbors as ourselves. I look forward to continuing our celebration on Tuesday when I host our annual Easter prayer breakfast as we remember the teachings of Jesus in our daily lives, stand with those around the world who are persecuted for their faith, and pray for peace, justice and freedom for all people.Read the president's full statement on Passover below:Michelle and I send our warmest greetings to all those celebrating Passover in the United States, in the State of Israel, and throughout the world.  Tonight, for the seventh year, I’ll hold a Seder in the White House, and we’ll join millions of Jewish families as we retell one of humanity’s great stories of liberation. The Exodus was neither easy nor quick. The Israelites’ journey to freedom required them to choose faith over fear and courage over complacency. Above all, it required the works of an awesome God, who led them out of bondage with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.  The story of the Exodus – the signs and wonders that appeared when hope seemed lost, the Jewish people’s abiding belief that they would one day reach the Promised Land – has inspired countless generations over the years. It inspired Jewish families to hold fast to their faith, even during times of terrible persecution. It inspired young Civil Rights leaders as they marched across an Alabama bridge in search of their own Promised Land, half a century ago.   And it continues to inspire us today. Tonight, my family will read the passage of the Haggadah that declares we must see ourselves as though we personally were liberated from Egypt. The Exodus reminds us that progress has always come slow and the future has always been uncertain, but it also reminds there is always reason for hope.   Like the Israelites who Moses led out of slavery long ago, it is up to us to never lose faith in the better day that lies ahead. In our own country, we can continue our march toward a more perfect union. Around the world, we can seek to extend the miracles of freedom and peace, prosperity and security, to more of God’s creation. And together, we can continue the hard but awesome work of tikkun olam, and do our part to repair the world.   From my family to yours, Chag Sameach."

It is a national treasure and should be permanently protected through legislation for future generations,"" Obama said in the letter.The Interior Department first released its proposal calling for the expanded protections in January but faced instant rebuke from Republicans, who are pushing energy issues such as the refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline as a major part of their economic platform ahead of the 2016 elections.In his letter to Boehner on Friday, Obama said the department had since reviewed available science and public comments in making its final recommendation. He called on Congress to authorize the expansion, a move likely to face fierce resistance in Congress.The additional 12 million acres would include the refuge's Coastal Plain. In addition to the current off-limits area, it would bring the refuge's total protected wilderness area to nearly 20 million acres (8 million hectares).At the same time, the Obama administration is close to approving Arctic drilling for Royal Dutch Shell for the first time since the company's mishap-plagued 2012 drilling season.Environmentalists have hailed the proposed designation, the highest level of federal protection under which oil and gas drilling is banned, while Republicans have long-called for opening up the area to boost domestic energy production.Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the head of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee who has introduced legislation permitting oil production in the Arctic refuge, blasted the move, vowing to block it.""We will continue to fight against the administration's efforts to impose new restrictions on Alaska's lands and resources,"" she said. ""A congressional designation of the Coastal Plain as wilderness will not happen on my watch.""More than 15 environmental advocacy groups, including the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters, vowed their support in a joint statement.""We're pleased to see President Obama courageously follow through on his commitment to protect the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,"" said Defenders of Wildlife President and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Rappaport Clark.

AFP PHOTO / TONY KARUMBA (Photo credit should read TONY KARUMBA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc148c92400006800382ad7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, we bring you one overlooked aspect of the stories that made news in recent days. You noticed the media forgot all about another story's basic facts? Tweet @TheWorldPost or let us know on our Facebook page.As dawn broke Thursday, some students at Garissa University in northeast Kenya were already at early morning prayers, while others remained fast asleep in their dormitories.Then, all hell broke loose. Gunmen stormed the campus, executing students as they prayed, pleaded for their lives, or hid in closets and under beds. At least 147 people were killed in the 13-hour assault, before the four attackers blew themselves up as security forces closed in. The Somali Islamist group al Shabab took responsibility for the attack, the deadliest in the African nation since al Qaeda bombed the U.S. embassy in Nairobi in 1998. The group is a breakaway faction  from the Islamic Courts Union, which briefly ruled Somalia in 2006 before it was ousted by U.S.-backed African forces. Al Shabab pledged allegiance to al Qaeda in 2012.While al Shabab is based in neighboring Somalia, it has increasingly exported its campaign of violence into Kenya.  More than 600 people have been killed in al Shabab attacks in Kenya since 2012, including the 2013 assault on Nairobi’s Westgate mall, the New York Times reports.The group's operations in Kenya increased after Nairobi sent troops to help oust al Shabab from several of its strongholds in Somalia in 2011. Under pressure in Somalia, the militants have stepped up recruitment of disaffected and impoverished youth in Kenya itself. One analyst told the BBC  that around one-quarter of al-Shabab fighters are Kenyan. The man whom Kenyan authorities suspect of masterminding Thursday's attack, Muhammad Kuno, is a Kenyan of Somali heritage and a former headmaster of a school in Garissa. An al-Shabab spokesman said the group attacked Garissa University because “the Christian government of Kenya has invaded our country.”Such sectarian rhetoric is a dangerous ploy to exploit religious tensions in Kenya. The nation’s Muslim minority, around 10 percent of the population, bears the brunt of discrimination and police brutality, according to human rights groups. Al-Shabab militants target Kenyan Muslims with propaganda that compares their suffering with the problems in Somalia, Foreign Affairs explains.Echoing earlier attacks, the militants who attacked Garissa University singled out Christians for execution, sparing some Muslim students.On Friday, Kenyan Muslims gathered in Garissa holding signs reading: “We are all Kenyans. No to terrorism.”  Despite its setbacks in Somalia, the group is still able to wreak havoc in the heart of the Somali capital. Just last week, the militant group besieged a Mogadishu hotel for 12 hours, killing 17 people, including Somalia's ambassador to Switzerland.More from The WorldPost's Forgotten Fact Series:"

Education is a basic human right, and millions of children are being denied that right. According to the Global Coalition to Protect Education From Attack, schools in more than 70 countries were subject to attack between 2009 and 2014. We are all too familiar with the heartbreaking stories -- from a school massacre in Pakistan to the kidnapping of students for use as child soldiers in South Sudan to the missing schoolgirls in Nigeria that sparked the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the UN Special Envoy on Global Education, says there is a war against education, and that attacks on schools are a crime against humanity. He's calling on governments to support a safe-schools declaration and officially give schools the same protected status under international law as Red Cross hospitals.At XPRIZE, we fully support the move to provide special protection to teachers, students, and schools around the world -- especially as schools are increasingly becoming battlegrounds. But for such a complex problem, we need to apply innovative, multi-pronged solutions. Technology can and must be used to assess risk at schools, but what about for learning? The Global Learning XPRIZE is trying to answer that part of the question. We are asking software developers, educators, and innovators from around the world to create open-source software that will allow children anywhere in the world to have access to education. Technology is not the only solution, but it must be part of the solution. If technology can do what we believe it can with learning, it will allow children in conflict zones and refugee camps to safely begin or continue their education.It's no secret that it will take dedication, focus, creativity, and funding to ensure the right of education for the world's children -- or that the need to support that right is now more important than ever. Clearly, people are recognizing this important work and honoring individuals like Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarth with the Nobel Peace Prize for their commitment to protecting the rights of children to education. Initiatives like the Let Girls Learn campaign also show the commitment to making sure girls around the world have access to education. But as the UNESCO Education for All Global Monitoring Report shows, there is still an immense amount of work that needs to be done to achieve quality education for all children.At XPRIZE, we want to harness technology to empower the 250 million children who lack basic literacy skills, whether it's due to scarcity of teachers, prejudice, or civil conflict. So let's take action to support teachers, students, and schools around the world. At the same time, let's look for creative new ways that technology can help children realize their human right to an education.Emily Musil Church is the Prize Manager of the Global Learning XPRIZE.Visit XPRIZE at xprize.org; follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Google+; and get our newsletter to stay informed."

Cure, resolution, recovery, and rehabilitation retain semantic currency; you can find these words throughout the medical textbooks and professional health literature."" But, continues Philip Alcabes, ""healing, with its resonance of renewal, has been banished to the precincts of so-called alternative medicine,"" shelved, shall we note, along with religion?Those will be read as fighting words by many, or inaccurate generalizations by others. For whatever limits they possess, these provocations by Alcabes, professor of public health at Adelphi University, zero-in directly on an area of increasing notice, debate, threat, and promise.Dr. Alcabes follows by asking, ""Is healing important? Is it too New Agey or too fuzzy or too old-fashioned for today's medical culture?""He finds it appearing in treatises on ""complementary medicine, energy medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, Islamic medicine, African medicine, music as medicine, and significantly, faith [emphasis mine.]... How to account for this curious void? Has healing, the most central aspect of care for the ill, been banished from doctoring today?"" To further his argument, the author says that today's ""health care facilities"" are really ""temples of diagnosis.""But Alcabes, after doing his own diagnosing of the problem he posed, turns positive. ""Already there are signs of... rediscovery, a heartening movement for narrative medicine, encouraging doctors to undertake active listening and recognize that the patient's storytelling might provide excellent clues to diagnosis and effective therapy.""He cites several other signs of recovery and rediscovery in The American Scholar (Spring, 2015), the popular magazine of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, but we cannot detail them all here.Instead, back to Alcabes' question, ""Is healing important?"" which we might extend to ask: is it important to deal with this in a column on religion and American public life? Usually our rubric prompts readers and us to expect religion-making-news, especially in conflict over doctrine, institutions, civic life and, here, medical problems and debates.Yet The American Scholar in this and other instances alerts us to examine where religion, by whatever definition, is most at home and active. Thesis: religion is at home and active when it comes close to ""healing"" or ""soul"" as experienced in religious congregations, spiritual circles, and care.Why bring up this ""healing"" side right now? Such a notice is in place in a week holy to Christians and Jews and many ""spiritual fellow-travelers.""And I was further awakened as I did research for a five-week probe in which I participated at Fourth Presbyterian Church across the street from where I live. I heard and overheard and inquired enough to note that professionals and ""everybody else"" are more and more alert to the healing dimensions.This being Holy Week where I come from and go to, I should confess.My research for Fourth Presbyterian Church led me back to two books produced by 21 + 15 scholars whom I corralled as co-coordinating editor and turned over to three active editors. I presume the books are out of print, so this is not a tardy sales pitch for stock from 1989 and 1997.Now, the sin to which I plead guilty. I helped select the categories used in the following titles and sub-titles: Caring and Curing: Health and Medicine in the Western Religious Traditions and, oh-oh(!): Healing and Restoring: Health and Medicine in the World's Religious Traditions (Eastern, African, Native American and more).Were we editors so defined by the still and always valuable ""diagnostic-ruled model"" that we overlooked the ""healing"" model that rose up in, and dominated wherever East/West/North/South religious specialties contributed?Forgive us.

Not only have relations between the United States and Iran begun to thaw after 30 years of enmity, but it is increasingly looking like the international community will be able to solve the Iran nuclear crisis together. Under the framework agreement announced on April 2, if implemented, Iran will significantly scale down its nuclear program and allow for unprecedented, intrusive inspections and monitoring. In return, nuclear-related sanctions imposed by the United States and the United Nations Security Council will be lifted. For some nonproliferation experts, even the steps Iran has already taken would have been enough. Or as those who are celebrating Passover today would say, ""Dayenu: It is enough."" The interim agreement negotiated in November 2013 froze and rolled back Iran's nuclear program. UN weapons inspectors have had access to Iran's nuclear facilities. By all accounts, Iran was complying with the interim deal. This is owed, in no small part, to a conscious move by President Obama to open his hand to the Iranian nation during his first days in office. It is useful to remember where we were prior to this diplomatic opening. While President Bush pursued a policy of non-engagement, Iran significantly bolstered its nuclear infrastructure. In 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry summed up that development this way: In 2003, when the Iranians made an offer to the former administration with respect to their nuclear program, there were 164 centrifuges ... That offer was not taken. Subsequently, sanctions came in, and today there are 19,000 centrifuges and growing.Thus, the nuclear agreement announced on April 2 is nothing short of a major breakthrough. As many have pointed out, there is still a long way to go between here and implementation. The negotiating parties must write the final accord and then implement it. Hawks on both sides will work hard to scuttle this success. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Illinois), for example, who has supported imposing more sanctions on Iran since the interim agreement was announced, compared President Obama to Neville Chamberlain making a deal with Hitler prior to the start of World War II and likened the deal to Nazi appeasement. No doubt, hardliners in Iran stridently oppose the compromises they must make in order to receive sanctions relief.Compromise, as they say, is when both sides walk away unhappy. Yet, at least for now, there is much to cheer, including that the prospect of war between Iran and the United States just significantly decreased. Just ask well-known television commentator Bill O'Reilly, who said as a tentative endorsement of the agreement:You don't want a war with Iran. You don't want to bomb that country, because the unintended consequences will set the world aflame. So if you can get something that's decent, you give it a shot. I think that's a legitimate point.We must not make too much of the thaw in U.S-Iran relations, given the two nations' many opposing interests. But with the historic breakthrough on the nuclear issue, we have been given a taste of what diplomatic engagement can lead to. For now, it is the minimized risk of a nuclear-armed Iran and the attendant strengthening of nuclear nonproliferation norms. For now, it is the diminished risk of war with Iran. So for now, dayenu. With the Easter and Passover season upon us, hope springs eternal.Susan Shaer is Executive Director of Women's Action for New Directions (WAND). She is celebrating Passover this week with an orange on the Seder plate and will rejoice in the singing of ""Dayenu."""
27,WOMEN,What It Takes To Take The Lead,"Dr. Deana Murphy, ContributorCareer Performance Solutionist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-it-takes-to-take-the-lead_b_6964824.html,Challenge and controversy is a big slice of the leader's pie. People watch how you handle yourself and adversity.,2015-04-02,Portrait of female architect at high table in modern studio,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb602941f0000df0024984c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I began my career in corporate leadership -- in those days, I served in executive management at a global financial institution -- I not only wanted to be good; I wanted to be great. A female taking the lead meant proving my ability to contribute to the success of the organization. This would help me be effective in my managing assignment. Looking back, my obligation was more than analyzing options and making decisions. I know now it was further about human resilience and resilient leadership. It narrowed down to how I influenced others by being accountable to myself.Challenge and controversy is a big slice of the leader's pie. People watch how you handle yourself and adversity. Your responsiveness is how they define you going forward. Here's what those experiences taught me and how you can recognize your resilient voice in taking the lead -- whether scaling the corporate ladder, defining your path as an entrepreneur, ministering in your community or running your household: Lead Your Own LifeIf you hope to lead others, you must first effectively lead yourself. The greatest likely source for resilient leadership and influence is inside of you. In her book, Talking to Yourself, Pamela Butler says, ""Self-leadership has been more broadly defined as 'the process' of influencing oneself to establish the self-direction and self-motivation needed to perform.""I found courage and inspiration in learning things about myself -- strengths and weaknesses -- and intentionally using techniques of identifying, envisioning, reflecting and letting go. If you want to run your life and improve on relating to others, self-awareness will allow you to understand others, how they characterize you, your attitude and responses to them. Locate any personality and behavior patterns that are both limiting and liberating you. This will open up more freedom, more creativity, more confidence, more possibilities and more resilience. My advice: Develop a sense of who you are, and strive to stretch your skills beyond the unthinkable. Strengthen your core abilities. Influence your communication, behaviors and emotions. Lead with Resilience From my vantage point, women lead differently than men. As high-achievers, we have this savvy ability to thrive despite hardships or risky experiences. Research shows  that we approach our tasks head on. Instead of wracking the brain for solutions, we intuitively look at situations from a new and different angle. Leading with resilience is a necessary element of our personality. We are more collaborative and we ask for help. We move beyond self-interest and fully transform those we lead. I experienced people changing their minds without considering how it would shake my life, so I began to psychologically prepare myself. I learned to adjust and adapt. I became a fast learner. I discovered how to acclimatize easily. Instead of merely bouncing back, bounce forward with the core purpose of understanding yourself and learning ways to articulate your values and ethics looking to the future, refusing to be a victim. I suggest staying open to feedback and remaining alert for ensuing changes. Change can be good in the end if handled properly. Take responsibility for your actions. You will feel more empowered as you put your efforts where you have the most impact. Learning to be resilient never ends. Lead with WellnessOur bodies are not designed to endure stress, pressure and sleeplessness. We cannot expect to take the lead and not function in well-being. I learned to strive towards maintaining optimal physical, emotional and spiritual health. 8 to 10 of the 24 hours in day should include rest and refreshing to not impair your leadership effectiveness. Have a proactive approach to wellness. Regular exercise and smart food choices will gear up the energy and vitality needed to reduce anxiety, manage stress and improve self-esteem. Take the advice of the airline hostess and put on your oxygen mask first before helping someone else. If you are inefficient, others will suffer. Burning the candles at both ends is so yesterday. Gain any needed leverage by allocating additional hours for social and educational activities that make you more visible. Instead of pushing it long and alone, cut your learning curve by working with a mentor, receiving his/her wisdom, experience and knowledge. My recommendation is work truly smart, and not thoughtlessly hard. Know that a passion for perfection and excellence breeds burnout/exhaustion if physical and mental limitations are neglected.  Lead with Your Heart, Not Your HeadI learned that the heart is the voice of the resilient leader -- caring, sharing, improving, significance and abundance in all aspects of life -- are synonymous with it. People need to know that you are focused on their needs and you care about them. For that reason, the heartfelt leader sees herself as someone who is making an impact on the lives of others. She then becomes a life and career improver.I was that leader who aimed for perfection, thinking it meant seeking isolation and doing it alone. But the resilient leader leads with the heart and collaborates willingly with her team. No one person can win at any game alone. Succeeding implies allowing your commitment to developing others motivate and invigorate your soul.You must focus on the needs of others. See their value and express your compassion, forgiveness, trust, understanding and love. Cultivate the conviction of helping people improve. Connect the purpose of your heart with your actions.In some capacity, we all are leaders. How can your voice of resilience help you take the lead? Share your thoughts in the comments below."

That's what O'Reilly gave us in his book Killing Jesus: Jesus kvetching about taxation and big government. In the National Geographic dramatization Jesus is still complaining about taxes (but who isn't). Here, though, he is more vigorously castigating the rich while praising and embracing the poor. The rich are clearly the villains; there is no suggestion of a trickle-down economic system that might share the wealth. While the narrative does not add anything new, it may prove useful as a straightforward dramatization of the Gospels for bible classes and for others who wish to review and discuss the Gospel stories about Jesus. The production pretty much selectively follows the Gospels' depiction of Jesus' birth, ministry, and death, with a few embellished departures. For example, Elizabeth and Zachariah, parents of John the Baptist, join Mary, Joseph, and Jesus in their journey to Egypt, a journey they make in order to evade King Herod's order to kill all children in Bethlehem age two and younger. The couple accompanying Mary and Joseph is a cozy addition, but it didn't happen that way, according to Matthew's account of the event (Matthew 2: 13-14).That said, in several important respects this production is unique as an authentic representation of the life of Jesus. Jesus, his family, and followers are portrayed as dedicated Jews. There is not even a hint about a new religion -- not until the postscript do we learn that after the crucifixion, Jesus' death and teachings did inspire a new religion that today has two billion followers. The production takes care to show Jesus' criticisms, as in the Gospels, as strictly directed against the Jewish leadership (the Sanhedrin) and, in particular, the ruthless power obsessed High Priest Caiaphas. Jesus deplores their superficial display of piety and charges that the leaders do not represent the true spiritual teachings of the Torah. Jesus fills in this omission in his sermons to multitudes of Jewish followers. Throughout the film, Jesus is called Rabbi. Adding to the authenticity of the film is the absence of blond blue-eyed fair-skinned northern Europeans or Scandinavians. Jesus, his family, disciples, and followers, as well as other Jews, are conspicuously Semitic in appearance. They are dark-skinned, with dark, if not, black hair. Also, the attire of the Jewish villagers is spare--many are shown wearing plain Jewish shawls and headwear. Their dwellings, including Jesus' family abode, are crude and simple, true to the architecture for the poor and working-class in Galilee in the first century. These depictions--physical appearance, clothing, housing, Jewish artifacts --are dramatic departures from the Renaissance representations of Jesus and his fellow Jews.Walk thru the Renaissance Gallery of any museum and you will see painting after painting jarringly at odds with the images in Killing Jesus. In these artistically magnificent Renaissance paintings you will typically be greeted by a blond, blue-eyed Jesus and other similar appearing ""Semites"" ensconced in palatial settings with regal attire. They are identified as strictly Christian with no indication of any connection to Judaism.Let's just focus on one element common in Renaissance paintings: Jesus and others in his entourage displaying a crucifix. Imagine the reaction if in Killing Jesus, Jesus, his disciples, and others were pictured strolling near the Temple in Jerusalem and in the villages in Judaea and Galilee with crucifix staffs -- a feared and hated symbol at the time, associated with the tens of thousands of brutal crucifixions of Jews and others. It would be shocking, anachronistic, and blatantly false. Yet these false representations appear in a trove of Renaissance paintings. They would be the only images of the Gospel figures that Europeans would view for centuries -- and that we still see today. On his July 26, 2014, O'Reilly Factor Broadcast Bill O'Reilly slammed me for my criticism of Renaissance art for depicting Jesus as a Christian at a time when he was a dedicated Jew and Christianity did not exist. Ironically, the National Geographic production Killing Jesus, Executive Producer Bill O'Reilly, confirms my point. Jesus is shown fiercely dedicated to Judaism, as in the Gospels. It's therefore not surprising that the word ""Jew"" appears eighty-two times in the Gospels and the word ""Christian"" not at all. In fact, it's safe to say that if Jesus and his disciples were to view Renaissance images, like the ones below, they might think they were cartoons.  (Baptism of Jesus by Ottavio Vannini ,  Holy Family with John the Baptist by Fra Bartolomeo, and The Last Supper by Fra Angelico) Art historians might do well to view the National Geographic production of Killing Jesus and afterwards re-examine Renaissance images. They might then finally acknowledge the falsification of biblical history in Renaissance artworks, which has contributed to the historic divide between Christians and Jews, a divide that is only now in the process of reconciliation and healing. Kudos to Bill O'Reilly, script writer Walon Green, and the National Geographic Channel for setting the record straight by reminding us of the two sides of the Jesus story: Jesus the dedicated Jew and Jesus whose legacy is the emergence of Christianity.

Organizers of a major gamers' convention and a large church gathering say they're considering moving events from Indianapolis over a bill that critics say could legalize discrimination against gays. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f0d52200004301dd838e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The powerful grassroots backlash against Indiana's anti-gay ""religious freedom"" law is yielding results and inspiring hope. Right-wing supporters of the law were seemingly caught unawares by a grassroots response that's put them on the defensive.On Monday, the Georgia House Judiciary Committee canceled a meeting to discuss a ""religious freedom"" bill similar to Indiana's. The ""Georgia Religious Freedom Restoration Act"" passed the state's Senate earlier this month. Like Indiana's law, Georgia's bill would give businesses and private individuals a legal defense for denying services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The bill would undoubtedly pass in Georgia's state House, where Republicans hold a near 2-to-1 majority, if it ever comes up for a vote.Perhaps the backlash against Indiana's law gave Georgia Republicans second thoughts.● A social media campaign against the state launched under the hashtag #boycottindiana. ● At the urging of the grassroots organization Freedom Indiana, the National College Athletics Association (NCAA) condemned the so-called ""religious freedom"" law, in a statement saying the law creates ""concern"" for future events in Indiana. ● The Republican CEO of Angie's List canceled plans to build the company's headquarters in Indiana -- plans that would have generated about $40 million in economic activity. ● In a letter to Indiana's Republican governor Mike Pence, the CEOs of nine different companies headquartered in Indiana expressed concern that the law would lead to discrimination against their employees. ● Other major companies have condemned Indiana's law, and similar laws in other states, including Walmart, Yelp, Salesforce, Eli Lily, The Gap, Levi Strauss, Twitter, and Anthem. ● In a Washington Post op-ed, Apple CEO Tim Cook opposed the legislation on behalf of Apple. ● The Democratic governors of Connecticut and Washington state announced bans on state-funded travel to Indiana. The mayors of Seattle, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. announced similar bans.Georgia is not alone. While Arkansas lawmakers moved forward with their own bill, North Carolina's Republican governor Pat McCrory said he would not sign a ""religious freedom"" bill passed in his state. Montana's ""religious freedom"" bill was narrowly defeated in the state House after Gov. Steve Bullock (D) noted the backlash against Indiana's law, and said Montana didn't need a similar measure.(Update: Arkansas governor Asa Hutchison has refused to sign the bill that sits on his desk. He has called on the legislature to make changes before sending it back to him. Hutchison's decision marks a serious shift, as he had previously pledged to sign the bill.)Finally, unable to ignore a grassroots backlash that's quickly grown large enough to threaten his state's economic future, Indiana governor Mike Pence held a press conference to call for a legislative ""fix"" for a law he spent the last week saying wasn't broken.[fve]https://youtu.be/LVMEkvin4lg[/fve]The GOP's ""Indiana Problem""This week Mike Pence came to embody what might henceforth be known as the GOP's ""Indiana problem."" Once a symbol of the GOP's ""deep bench"" and one of its top presidential contenders for 2016, Pence's conservative credentials -- and the religious right's continued influence over the GOP -- demanded that he defend Indiana's anti-gay ""religious freedom"" law. Likewise, GOP presidential hopefuls rushed to defend Indiana's law, seeking to motivate Christian conservatives to back them in the primaries.The problem is that Republicans have to be either dishonest or deluded to back ""religious freedom"" laws, only to end up tripping over the truth or running headlong into reality. Pence signed the ""religious freedom"" bill into law in a ceremony that was closed to the press and the public. Pence later tweeted a photograph from the signing, but refused to name the lobbyists who attended.That's probably because, though he claimed the law was not about anti-LGBT discrimination, Pence was flanked by some of Indiana's most prominent anti-gay activists when he signed it. Those same anti-gay activists oppose any attempt to ""clarify"" that Indiana's law does not legalize discrimination. Conservatives are already blasting Pence for ""caving"" by calling for such clarifications, because they know that it could potentially destroy the bill by exposing one dishonest defense of it. Pence and other supporters falsely claim that the law simply mirrors the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act and those in other states, while ignoring some important differences that are so obvious even a Fox News anchor can spot them.Meanwhile, spending so much time and energy passing and defending such laws creates problems for Republicans, now and in the future. Indianapolis' Republican mayor Greg Ballard just signed an executive order reaffirming that groups doing business with the city must abide by its human rights ordinance, which prohibits anti-LGBT discrimination. Backers of the religious freedom law are ""missing the bigger trend,"" Ballard says.Ballard has a point. A 2014 Pew Research survey shows that Americans are almost evenly split on whether businesses should be able to deny service to LGBT people on the basis of ""religious freedom,"" with 47 percent saying businesses should be allowed to refuse services, and 49 percent saying businesses should be required to provide services.However, a closer look reveals the ""bigger trend."" Among Americans ages 30 to 49, 50 percent believe that ""religious freedom"" shouldn't be a license to discriminate, compared to 46 percent who believe otherwise. Among Americans ages 13 to 29, 62 percent oppose such discrimination. A recent poll by the Public Religion Research Institute shows that 80 percent of millennials believe that LGBT Americans deserve to have laws protecting them against discrimination.It wasn't always like this. Of all the old ""culture war"" battles, LGBT equality is the one where progressive activists have ""flipped the script."" Opposition to equality is the new ""third rail,"" and politicians who touch it are in for a shock. That happened, in large part, because LGBT activists and allies organized against such laws, and humanized the issue so that people increasingly see these laws as a direct attack on their family, friends, neighbors and co-workers.It happened relatively fast, too. As recently as 2008, then congressman Mike Pence pointed to the success of anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives as a sign of the strength of American conservatism. Just four years later, marriage equality won and anti-gay conservatives lost in every state where marriage equality was on the ballot.There are other issues -- among them immigration, Social Security, unemployment, workers' rights -- on which politicians feel they can act against human decency and fairness without consequence, and conservatives work hard to dehumanize the poor and vulnerable. The lesson here for Democrats is to humanize these issues, and wear down conservative efforts to turn such people as low-income Americans, public workers and undocumented residents into ""those people,"" until a majority of Americans see ""those people"" as their family, friends and neighbors -- and reject conservative policies that harm them.In 2016 and beyond, Republicans will find it hard to strike a balance between ""religious freedom"" and discrimination. They will find it even harder to choose between either ""caving"" and alienating their base, or alienating the growing majority of voters and facing a grassroots onslaught."
32,COLLEGE,Student Loan Victims Pay the Price of ED Inaction,"Eileen Connor, ContributorPublic interest lawyer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/student-loan-victims-pay-_b_6987224.html,"If legal remedies for borrowers, such as defense to repayment, exist only on paper, they are not worth very much. Meeting with Corinthian borrowers is the first step in the Department's necessary recognition that it needs to be more proactive and protective when it comes to student borrowers.",2015-04-02,2015-04-01-1427911632-9758619-iStock_000019973737Medium.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-01-1427911632-9758619-iStock_000019973737Medium-thumb.jpg,"On March 31, the Department of Education met with a group of student loan borrowers at a meeting hosted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These borrowers, organized by a group known as the Debt Collective, borrowed substantial amounts of federal and private student loans in order to attend schools operated by the now-infamous Corinthian College.  In a deal that purported to disclaim any successor liability for Corinthian's student-directed misdeeds, the Department infused the school with cash to prevent a sudden shut down of operations, allowed for ongoing student enrollment, and brokered the sale of many Corinthian Campuses to ECMC, a collector of student loans. This bailout and controlled unwinding of Corinthian is unusual, but its effect is not unprecedented in one key respect. The Department has evidenced no intention to go back over its books and relieve debt obligations that never should have been issued, had Corinthian played by the rules.This, at least, is familiar. There once was a for-profit chain of beauty and trade schools that operated under the umbrella of Wilfred American Educational Corporation. At its peak, it ran 60 campuses in 15 states, drawing tens of millions of dollars in federal student aid. After multiple investigations and two criminal prosecutions of Wilfred's owners for financial aid fraud, the school declared bankruptcy and closed, in the mid-1990s. The Department concluded that the school regularly falsified the eligibility of students for financial aid. This means that in theory, many of those loans are subject to discharge under federal law. Of course, most of those who attended a Wilfred school -- often immigrant women without a high school education -- have no way of knowing, unless the Department tells them, that they may be eligible for discharge. Yet nearly 20 years after reaching the conclusion that Wilfred falsified loans, the Department is still actively enforcing at least 60,000 of these loans, often by means of involuntary collection such as wage garnishment and tax refund offset.Through outreach, the legal organization where I practice, the New York Legal Assistance Group, has been able to apply for loan discharges on behalf of some 70 former Wilfred students. To date, we have succeeded in getting upwards of $800,000 of debt discharged and money returned to these borrowers. (Over decades, the initial principal on these debts has ballooned from an average of $5,000 to well over $40,000 in some cases, including interest and fees applied by the Department). But the Department vigorously opposed our request that it send a notice to every borrower who attended this fraudulent institution, and temporarily suspend collection. Instead of taking this fundamentally fair step, the Department has devoted extensive time and resources in litigation to establish that it has unfettered discretion to make the ""policy assessment"" that no action is warranted. In short, the Department's position is that it owes borrowers nothing but a debt collection notice, not even information that they desperately need, and surely deserve, to protect their rights.The lack of information and transparency about key options for debt relief is a recurring problem. Today, the Debt Collective presented the Department with paperwork from hundreds of Corinthian borrowers, who are asserting that the school's misrepresentations and other illegal acts render their loans unenforceable. They are invoking a provision of the Higher Education Act, also incorporated into borrowers' loan paperwork, known as ""borrower defense to repayment."" The spirit and plain text of this provision clearly offers a path to debt relief when a school relies on deceptive and predatory tactics to induce students to enroll and borrow student loans. The provision incorporates consumer protection law, which varies by state. But the Department has offered no formal guidance about how to assert this defense. There is not even a form, which is why I consulted with the Debt Collective in their efforts to create a template for Corinthian borrowers. Separately, and to better advise clients, I have submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Department about their policies concerning defense to repayment, and have received no response to date -- even though the Department's response is now months overdue.I have also submitted defense to repayment applications on behalf of two NYLAG clients, who attended a for-profit school that the New York State Attorney General found had wildly inflated and falsified the job placement rates that it promoted to students. The Attorney General's case against the school settled and the school paid some restitution to borrowers, but the Department has nonetheless continued to seek to collect from my clients on tens of thousands of dollars in federal student loans. This week, we received a response to one of my client's requests from a division of the Department, which indicated no knowledge whatsoever of the defense to repayment provisions.If legal remedies for borrowers, such as defense to repayment, exist only on paper, they are not worth very much. Meeting with Corinthian borrowers is the first step in the Department's necessary recognition that it needs to be more proactive and protective when it comes to student borrowers, both on the back end and the front end of administering federal student aid. This of course means vigorous enforcement to prevent another situation like Corinthian. But it also requires, at a minimum, formulating transparent and accessible policies and procedures to effectuate borrower relief provisions like defense to repayment. And when there is ample evidence that borrowers are entitled to relief under the law, as here, it is incumbent upon the Department to do more."

According to a recent study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, 1 out of 9 children self-reported a suicide attempt before graduating high school with forty percent of those children in grade school. But how do we combat this hopelessness -- the primary predictor of suicide and #1 symptom of depression? By teaching hope.Schools for Hope is a new, free educational curriculum developed by the International Foundation for Education and Research on Depression (iFred) to prevent youth suicide by giving ANYONE -- parents, students, educators, group leaders -- the necessary learning tools and lifesaving skills to find and maintain hope. Teaching children the importance of caring for their mental health is crucial to their emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Schools for Hope is designed to give children the tools to handle life's challenges and empower them to become their most vital selves. The program uses a research-based curriculum of lessons, stories and activities to explore the concrete actions a person can take to create his or her own hopeful attitude.Schools for Hope is free and available to any interested school, community group, after-school program or nonprofit. It comes with comprehensive instructions that make it easily self-led, so the costs associated with implementation are low. Currently the program is designed for and being tested with fifth grade students, because there is a significant rise in suicide attempts among 12-year-olds, the typical age of a sixth grader.The program educates students on the importance of emotional health and wellbeing, how to get their brain into a hopeful state, meditation and deep breathing techniques. It teaches children how to define hope, explore and define the meaning of 'success', and practice emotional self-regulation techniques. In addition, Schools for Hope incorporates lessons about the biology of the brain and how students can connect their passion and purpose in life.For interest in testing or implementing Schools for Hope, please email schoolsforhope@ifred.org or visit the website to download the free lesson plans. The site also includes tools and support items for teachers and educators, as well as research on the program and information on how the curriculum fits with current social and emotional learning standards mandated in several states. Join us, and let's transform these spaces -- schools, after-school programs, youth groups, social networks - into areas of inspiration for our children. Let's teach them that there is another way.That there is hope for another day."

But it is a little surprising that as Americans age and put on more body fat, the quality of their diets generally improves.In other words, Americans do try to correct their softening midsections with things like salads and lean proteins. And, unfortunately, that doesn't quite work, according to a recent analysis of physical activity, diet and weight among U.S. adults. Instead, whether or not a person engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity was more likely to predict their ability to stave off age-associated weight gain. The study, which breaks down data points from 4,999 American adults ages 20 to over 70 years old, is large enough in sample size to depict an accurate snapshot of how Americans are aging -- and how their diet and exercise levels change over the years. ""Our study points to the very important impact of physical activity on weight status in U.S. adults, and in particular it points to the critical role of the age-related decline in physical activity on the increasing rates of overweight and obesity that we see with aging,” said lead researcher Russell Pate, Ph.D., of the University of South Carolina. ""Our findings indicate that increasing fatness with age in U.S. adults cannot be explained by changes in the quality of the diet they consume.""Pate took information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which measured activity via accelerometer (a plus because it’s much more accurate than self-reported information) and recorded information on weight, body mass index, waist circumference and quality of diet. He then controlled for factors like race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and whether or not a person smoked. The takeaway? ""Americans should meet the federal physical activity guideline, 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week,” wrote Tate. ""If most American adults met that guideline rates of overweight and obesity would be substantially lower than they are today.""Overall, Americans’ activity levels are lower thanks to sedentary jobs, technology and better mass transportation options, according to the American Heart Association. We’re paying for those conveniences with our health; about 69 percent of adults are either overweight or obese, which increases risk for diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, some cancers and reproductive problems. Pate's research was published in the latest edition of the Medicine & Science In Sports & Exercise journal. "

37,POLITICS,"For North Carolina Attorney General, Running For Governor Will Mean Taking On His Top Client",Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roy-cooper-north-carolina_n_6986844.html,,2015-04-02,"North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper answers questions, Saturday Jan. 13, 2007, in Raleigh, N.C. after he announced that his office agreed to take over the sexual assault case against three Duke University lacrosse players at the request of District Attorney Mike Nifong. (AP Photo/Karen Tam)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f0d3260000300183c2e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"RALEIGH, N.C.-- When North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper (D) announced in February that the state would receive $21.5 million in a settlement with Standard & Poor’s, he could only make recommendations for how he thought Gov. Pat McCrory (R) and the GOP-controlled General Assembly should dish out the gains. The legislature had passed a law stripping Cooper of the authority to distribute the settlement money. Still, Cooper's recommendation -- that the money go toward saving an expiring teacher-recruitment program and increasing the salaries of scientists at the state’s crime lab -- was an indication of what types of issues he'll prioritize in his all-but-inevitable bid for governor in 2016.Cooper has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is considered the likely Democratic nominee to challenge McCrory, who was elected in 2012. The contest is already close -- a poll last month had McCrory up by just two points -- and is expected to be hard-fought, as races in North Carolina tend to be. But the race is likely to be unique in that, so far, it is the sole contest in which an attorney general is expected to challenge an incumbent governor. And in North Carolina, which has had Democratic governors for the vast majority of the last century, a Cooper victory would return the state to divided government. (After McCrory was elected in 2012, Republicans had complete control of the executive and legislative branches for the first time in more than 100 years.)On the campaign trail, the state's top lawyer will have to explain why he defended legislation he personally opposed, but also why he occasionally broke from the legislature and the governor -- who are, after all, his clients. Cooper has opposed the administration on issues such as marriage equality and voting rights, which has led to an acrimonious relationship with both the statehouse and the governor's mansion. (Between 2000, when he was first elected, and 2010, when the Republican wave swept the state, Cooper worked alongside a more amenable legislature and two Democratic governors.) Cooper's highest-profile break from the legislature came in July 2014. After a 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling struck down Virginia's same-sex marriage ban, Cooper said he would no longer defend North Carolina's.""Our attorneys have vigorously defended North Carolina marriage law, which is their job,"" Cooper said at the time, explaining his decision. ""But today we know our law almost surely will be overturned as well. Simply put, it is time to stop making arguments we will lose and instead move forward, knowing that the ultimate resolution will likely come from the U.S. Supreme Court.""Similarly, in 2013, Cooper caused a stir by urging McCrory not to sign a a sweeping and controversial package of voting restrictions passed by the legislature. But at the same time, Cooper is the state's lawyer, so he's obligated to defend laws that he believes are defensible, even if he personally opposes them. So, for instance, though Cooper is considered a supporter of reproductive rights, he asked the U.S. Supreme Court last month to review a federal appeals court ruling that struck down a North Carolina law requiring abortion patients to view a narrated ultrasound image prior to the procedure. The appeals court ruled that the ultrasound law violates the First Amendment rights of physicians by compelling delivery of ideological information ""irrespective of the needs or wants of the patient,"" and transforms ""the physician into the mouthpiece of the state."" But in petitioning the Supreme Court to take up the case, Cooper said the ultrasound law was consistent with the First Amendment as a regulation of medical practice.Just a few months earlier, though, Cooper spoke to a gathering of abortion rights supporters, criticizing state leaders ""who want the voice of politicians in the medical examining room telling the doctor what to say."" Mac McCorkle, an associate professor of the practice at Duke's Sanford School of Public Policy who has consulted for Democratic candidates, said his sense is that people think Cooper has ""been walking the line pretty well."" ""This is always been a tough thing, it's a gray area for attorneys general when they are elected. There's an argument that they really are independent and they've been independently hired and elected by the people, so they have some measure of discretion in what they decide to defend in terms of state action,"" McCorkle said. But not everyone agrees. ""His job as attorney general is to be the attorney for the state of North Carolina and you can't be the attorney of the state of North Carolina by attacking our governor and our legislature,"" NC GOP Executive Director Todd Poole said of Cooper on Wednesday. The legislature and McCrory have moved to de-fang Cooper's authority. Last year, McCrory approved a bill to move the State Bureau of Investigation, which had previously been under Cooper's Department of Justice, to the Department of Public Safety, an agency led by a McCrory appointee. The governor said the shift was aimed at ""taking the politics out"" of the investigative unit, and preventing ""interference with any type of an investigation from a political official."" But Democrats, along with the NC Sheriffs’ Association, said the unit should be separate from the administration it investigates. In another rebuff to Cooper, the General Assembly passed a law in 2013 reasserting its own leaders' power to hire their own counsel, stating that the leadership ""shall jointly have standing to intervene"" on behalf of the legislature. In a case challenging the legislature's redistricting maps, for instance, the legislature hired its own attorneys to defend the district boundaries alongside Cooper, who has indicated his support for an independent redistricting commission to de-politicize the process. Along the same lines, the law removing Cooper's power to distribute the money from the Standard & Poor's settlement suggested that the legislature wanted to keep the attorney general from pushing his policy priorities.The assembly's sharp rightward turn since 2010 -- as illustrated by its efforts to cut taxes, restrict voting and reproductive rights, prevent expansion of Medicaid, eliminate the Earned Income Tax Credit and redirect funds to charter and private schools -- gives Cooper a significant amount of ammunition for his likely campaign. He will be able to point to evidence that North Carolinians want a partisan reset: In September, the North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling found that the legislature's approval rating was just 18 percent. ""The legislature is trying to impose a radical national conservative agenda on a state that’s not ready for it, and didn’t ask for it,"" Morgan Jackson, a spokesman for Cooper, told The Huffington Post. ""That’s not the North Carolina way, so the question in 2016 is: Are we going to continue allow that happening or are we going to fight back?"""

39,HEALTHY LIVING,Some Personalities Are More Likely To Apologize Than Others,Lindsay Holmes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/personalities-and-apologi_n_6986930.html,,2015-04-02,Crumpled red paper heart with pen and the word Sorry written on it.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ea888250000360036f382.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," By Melissa Dahl  Follow @melissadahlThere are those healthy, well-adjusted people who are quick to swallow their pride and apologize when they've done something wrong. And then there are those for whom saying sorry does not come so easily. Recently, a team of Australian and Canadian researchers published the results of a study in which they sought to figure out which personality types are more likely to apologize than others. The new research was published online recently in the journal Personality and Individual Differences. Science of Us: 17 Things We Know About ForgivenessPatrick D. Dunlop of the University of Western Australia and his team recruited 139 adults, with an average age of about 31; the researchers also asked those individuals to recruit a friend for the study, like a romantic partner or a work colleague -- someone they'd known for at least a year. Each of the 139 individuals took a personality test, and their personalities were also rated by the friends they'd recruited -- and this is important because research suggests our friends are usually better than we are at accurately rating our own personalities. The study participants also answered a survey with questions about how likely (or unlikely) they were to apologize in certain situations. Science of Us: A Trick That Will Make Your Next Apology BetterAfter analyzing the survey responses, the researchers found that people who scored high in conscientiousness and honesty/humility were also more likely to say they apologized more frequently. (This study used the HEXACO model of personality, which stands for honesty/humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness.) The findings make intuitive sense -- conscientious people tend to be efficient and well organized, so perhaps their organization skills even help them offer expedient apologies; it's also not surprising that honest people would be more likely to own up to something they'd done wrong.Science of Us: What It's Like To Be Allergic To WiFiBut, as the researchers point out, although psychologists are starting to uncover what sorts of personalities are more likely to forgive, the flip side of that scenario -- the personality of the apologizer -- is not as well understood. One last interesting tidbit from this study: Agreeable people were less likely to offer quick apologies, in a finding that surprised the researchers. They don't offer much in the way of an explanation for this in their paper, either, something I'm sure they're very sorry about.
