Sarah Maslin Nir on the exploitation of nail salon workers brings long-awaited attention to a critical issue affecting many Asian-American women. Over 40 percent of nail salon workers nationwide are Asian-American. The average nail technician is 38 years old, has worked in the industry for nine years and typically works more than 40 hours per week. A majority of nail technicians are of reproductive age and lack basic health care coverage. Nail salon workers are underpaid, often exploited and face daily exposure to toxic chemicals. While it's tempting to blame these problems solely on bad employers, it's important to remember that these are systemic and structural issues. The work and safety of low-income women workers have long been ignored. From the local restaurant to our corner nail salon to the Rana Plaza factory collapse, the hidden price of low-cost items is often paid by poor, Asian women workers. The National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum (NAPAWF) chronicled the many gaps in federal policy in its 2011 report, ""Removing the Topcoat."" You may be surprised to learn that the entire cosmetics industry is unregulated. That means aisle upon aisle of products at your local pharmacy or supermarket -- as well as those used in nail salons -- are not subject to government safety standards or inspections. New research, soon to be released by NAPAWF, corroborates much of what Nir reports about the exploitation of nail salon workers. We also find that nail salon workers are often misclassified as ""independent contractors,"" meaning they are supposed to work for themselves and ""rent"" a space at a salon. Independent contractors are self-employed, so standard OSHA protections for workers don't apply. Minimum wage and overtime laws also don't apply. The plight of nail salon workers sits at the intersection of the environmental, economic and reproductive justice and immigrant rights movements. Young workers choose between their job and a healthy pregnancy. Undocumented workers are paid substandard wages and even experience wage theft without seeking help for fear of deportation. The many toxic chemicals used in salons can have a negative impact on the environment. Ultimately what we need is less greed and more immigration policy reform, good jobs for all and reproductive justice for Asian American women. Like most things that affect the lives of low-income women of color, there is not one ""magic bullet"" policy solution. However, we can and must take action. Here's how you can help now:1. Get the facts. Learn more about this issue by reading, ""Removing the Topcoat: Understanding Federal Oversight of Nail Salons"" and follow the work of the National Healthy Nail and Beauty Salon Alliance.2. Be a responsible consumer. The next time you're in a salon, get to know the worker and share that you care. Getting to know your nail salon worker is a great first step. If you encounter a language barrier, try to work through it. Tell your nail salon technician that you care about their health and safety and that you wouldn't mind if they wear gloves and a mask while they work with you. You can also share a Chinese, Korean or Spanish language version of the New York Times articles with your technician so they know that their issues are in the news.3. Value nail salon workers. Be prepared to pay more for your beauty. The low prices at nail salons are at the expense of workers. Tell your favorite salon owner that you'd be willing to pay more for good ventilation systems, protection for workers and a living wage for workers. Remember that not all owners are bad apples. There are many who would love to be able to green up their salons and offer higher wages.4. Hold cosmetic companies accountable. Got a favorite brand of nail products? Check to see how toxic it is on the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database. If your favorite brand isn't safe, write to them and demand that they make their products safe. Many of these same companies are selling healthier products in the European market where there are much stronger regulations against toxic chemicals. They choose not do the same in the US because they don't have to. Let companies know, your health and the health of workers come before profit.5. Help change the law. Tell elected officials to pass legislation to give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate cosmetic products and the Environmental Protection Agency the power to make sure that the chemicals being used are actually safe. Support the Raise the Wage Act, which would raise the federal minimum wage to $12 by 2020 and eliminate the unfair tipped minimum wage practice. There are campaigns in some cities, such as the NY Healthy Nail Salons Coalition who are pushing for local ordinances such as Int. 301A which would improve the lives of workers.6. Join us! There are a number of grassroots groups, like NAPAWF, that have been working on these issues for a long time. Shout outs to the CA Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative, Women's Voices for the Earth, the New York Healthy Nail Salons Coalition, Adhikaar and MinKwon Center for Community Action, just to name a few. Show us some love so we can continue to work to bring health and justice to nail salon workers. 7. Support immigrant rights. Help immigrant women pass comprehensive immigration policy reform. Some of the worst exploitation of salon workers happens because they are aspiring citizens. The only long-term solution is for there to be a way for undocumented nail salon workers to come out of the shadows, be allowed to work and to become citizens. Join We Belong Together, a campaign co-anchored by NAPAWF and the National Domestic Workers Alliance that is doing just that."
1,BUSINESS,Earned Media Can Yield Big Rewards for Philanthropy,"Jennifer Risi, ContributorGlobal Chief Communications Officer & Managing Director of Ogi...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/earned-media-can-yield-big-rewards-for-philanthropy_b_7270100.html,"Corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate citizenship, philanthropy, engagement, shared value - regardless of the name you use, this aspect of doing business is here to stay.   And like all core business attributes, communicating about it effectively is critical.",2015-05-13,2015-05-12-1431472454-288760-meetingroom730679__180.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-12-1431472454-288760-meetingroom730679__180-thumb.jpg,"Corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate citizenship, philanthropy, engagement, shared value - regardless of the name you use, this aspect of doing business is here to stay. And like all core business attributes, communicating about it effectively is critical. Communications tools and methods evolve, but the pillars remain: earned, owned and paid. If CSR is indeed a core expectation of doing business in today's economic environment, one cannot overlook any one of those three core areas to truly succeed. Over the past ten years we've seen companies' commitment to CSR initiatives grow, but many of these programs are only disclosed in the back pages of annual corporate reports. When strategic CSR communications plans are actually put in place, earned media is often left behind in favor of the safer and easier to control outlets, like the company's paid marketing and own websites and information channels. This is a mistake. CSR programs and earned media should go hand in hand. Here's why.  Just as CSR initiatives have become increasingly important in recent years, so too has the role of earned media relations. Rather than falling at the wayside as many experts predicted, earned media is far more important and far more influential than ever before.It should be regarded as a crucial tool for communicating CSR programs, especially as past tactics seem to have failed - a recent survey indicated that 70 percent of consumers are confused by the messages companies use to talk about their CSR initiatives. However the desire to understand them is evident - 93 percent of consumers want to know what companies are doing to make the world better. This dilemma is one that earned media can help to resolve. (SOURCE: 2013 Cone Communications/ Echo Global CSR Study)Consider it this way, at its very core CSR programs want to bring trust to your brand and influence consumers, and more than any other channel earned media is best at achieving this. Consumers trust media and blogs over any other form of marketing - in fact a Nielsen study found that 90 percent of consumers trust peer recommendations, while only 33 percent trust ads. So the first part of the key to successfully promoting CSR efforts is to integrate an earned media strategy. The second part is to ensure that when you do earn those media articles, promotion of that success is activated across all available platforms.A multi-platform approach is vital - for example video is a valuable tool as people process it 60,000 times faster than text. Today every media campaign today should focus on a strategic mix of traditional media, social media engagements and content (video, infographics) to drive influence, decisions and desired outcomes. Indeed, when successfully activated, earned media can also help to drive bottom-line performance. That's particularly important in the CSR world, where the mantra has evolved. CSR initiatives have risen above simply selling a product, or idea; today companies want to persuade consumers that they are working to have a positive effect on the world, and can be useful to the greater community. These messages can be met with skepticism or disbelief and that's why just as any CSR program must be accountable and transparent, so too must the communication around it. Endorsement through earned media cannot be bought or owned, it can only be gained organically, hence the term 'earned' - and its value in this industry. As CSR programs become an ever more important element of modern businesses, the way these programs are explained and communicated to the public is vital. Customer opinion can't be bought, which translates into a credibility that exists no other way - and probably never will. The bottom line is that consumers trust each other more than any other source when making a purchase, and that's something brands and their CSR programs can't afford to ignore - whatever the name you have decided to use."
2,IMPACT,We Need to Support Women In Nepal More Than Ever,"Dr. Musimbi Kanyoro, ContributorPresident and CEO, Global Fund for Women",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/we-need-to-support-women-in-nepal-more-than-ever_b_7270372.html,"Besides shelter, access to basic hygiene and healthcare is extremely limited, and hospitals are overwhelmed. This presents unique challenges for women and girls -- a fact too often overlooked in relief efforts.",2015-05-13,"A Nepalese woman sits outdoors after another earthquake in Bhaktapur, Nepal, Tuesday, May 12, 2015. A major earthquake has hit Nepal near the Chinese border between the capital of Kathmandu and Mount Everest less than three weeks after the country was devastated by a quake. (AP Photo/Tashi Sherpa)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1d9af1f00002e01236824.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Less than three weeks after a powerful earthquake in Nepal leveled villages and killed over 8,000 people, another devastating earthquake with a 7.3 magnitude rocked the country on Tuesday. Dozens of deaths and over 1,000 injuries have been reported as a result of this second quake. ""I was at Betrawati in a camp talking with mothers with newborn babies when the earth shook. Two landslides took place in front of my eyes, and the sky was full with dust,"" says Renu Rajbhandari, founder of Global Fund for Women grantee partner the Women's Rehabilitation Center in Nepal. ""I can't express the feeling of this particular time. There are no trace of villages [that once existed]. It's terrifying.""Nepal is now facing an unfathomable level of devastation, and women are very much at the frontlines of the recovery efforts. Many men in Nepal work oversees, leaving women to care for children and the elderly. Yet these women are also especially vulnerable, as our experience shows that their needs are often overlooked at times of crisis and during relief efforts. Throughout Nepal, the most critical and urgent need is shelter--a need which is only heightened by new damage from Tuesday's earthquake. Many people are living in makeshift camps or sleeping outdoors, which increases the risk of exposure to the elements and disease. Additionally, camp living combined with the instability of the current situation creates fertile ground for violence, including sexual violence. Without safe shelter, women and girls are especially at risk.Besides shelter, access to basic hygiene and healthcare is extremely limited, and hospitals are overwhelmed. This presents unique challenges for women and girls - a fact too often overlooked in relief efforts. Global Fund for Women grantee partner organizations visiting camps are often met with requests for health services for pregnant women or feminine hygiene products. One 17-year-old girl in a makeshift camp shared her painful personal experience: ""I was forced to sleep in the open sky during my period. We have only one tent and I am not allowed to touch my father. We have limited blankets and it rained heavily one night.""Across Nepal, a renewed fear and uncertainty is setting in just as many people were finally feeling a sense of calm following April's deadly quake. ""Everything was coming a little to normalcy...but now [after this second quake] it will be very, very difficult to rebuild,"" says Sadhana Shrestha, Executive Director of our grantee partner organization Tewa. ""I don't know what tomorrow holds."" While the damage from the second quake will further hamper already-challenging relief efforts, our grantee partners are committed to continuing their work. ""Staff are tired, physically and psychologically, and we don't know how long it will continue,"" says Rajbhandari. ""We will try our level best to help people right now. We are running 25 safe spaces for women in different areas, in spite of us being unsafe.""These organizations also know that women need more than just immediate, short-term relief. Women need long-term support, and they also have a major contribution to make. Involving women in decisions about rebuilding and resource allocation after a major disaster will ensure that gains for women aren't lost after a crisis. Having women at decision-making tables post-disaster mean that the needs of half the population aren't ignored. This will result in better social and economic outcomes for entire communities.With women both leading the relief efforts and facing unique challenges and vulnerability, women leaders in Nepal need our support now more than ever. That's why Global Fund for Women is providing crisis support to our grantee partners--local, women-led groups who are deeply rooted in the communities they serve. These groups are at the frontline of disaster impact and response, making sure that the unique needs of women and girls are met. We must ensure that women's voices are heard, especially now - and we must support these local, women-led groups filling critical holes in both immediate relief efforts and in long-term recovery.Global Fund for Women's grantee partners urgently need support in order to address the needs of their communities and work to immediately fill gaps in relief efforts to ensure long-term recovery - especially for women and their families.

The Scottish National Party, embodying a left-wing version of identity politics, wiped out Labour in Scotland, allowing the Conservatives to gain an absolute majority in Parliament. The government of Prime Minister David Cameron -- who has focused on British identity, rather than the UK's common destiny with Europe -- will undoubtedly hold a referendum on the U.K.'s continued membership in the European Union, with unpredictable consequences.For decades, political debate in Europe focused largely on economic institutions and policies. Conservatives argued for a private sector-driven economy, unfettered markets, low taxes, reduced government spending and limited public goods. Liberals and social democrats supported a private-ownership economy, markets, European integration and increased trade, tempered by substantially redistributive taxes and transfers, a strong social safety net and some public ownership in areas such as infrastructure and finance.In this bi-polar system, the parties differed on the nuances of economic policy, but broadly agreed on democratic values, the European project and the need to adapt to and manage globalization, rather than reject it wholesale. But, with the growing success of appeals to identity and renewed ethnic or religious nationalism, that is changing. Are the ghosts of the early and mid-twentieth century returning?The question is particularly relevant for Europe, but it also has global significance. In the Middle East, for example, identity politics is manifesting itself in its most sinister form: a chaotic and violent clash between Sunni and Shia Muslims, exemplified by the rise of the Islamic State.Loyalty to a perceived identity can have innocuous and enriching components, such as, say, the promotion of a regional language. The problem with identity politics is that it places the ""in"" group at odds with the perceived ""other"" -- an approach that can easily foster chauvinism, invidious discrimination, and open antagonism.One major reason for the resurgence of identity politics in Europe is globalization, which has limited the capacity of countries or peoples to control their economies. Indeed, the global economy has become so interconnected, and world markets so powerful, that there appears to be little scope for national policies to disrupt hyper-mobile capital flows.While globalization has helped to boost overall prosperity, it has been most beneficial for those who form the new global elite. Meanwhile, many people in Europe face greater economic insecurity, owing to new technologies or competition from lower-cost workers elsewhere. Unless they can upgrade their knowledge and skills -- and, in some cases, move to a new industry or location -- they face constrained economic opportunities. These disadvantaged groups are particularly large in the countries that were hit hardest by the recent global financial crisis and now struggle with high unemployment.But even people who are relatively prosperous are frustrated by some features of globalization. They may oppose the use of their taxes to ""subsidize"" poorer people who do not share their identity, such as immigrants, French-speaking Belgians, southern Italians or Greeks.When it comes to trade protectionism, European integration and economic globalization, those on the far right and the far left often share the same views. In France, for example, many supporters of the National Front voted communist 30 years ago. And, indeed, the National Front's economic program is rather similar to that of the Left Front (an electoral bloc comprising the French Communist Party and the Left Party).Of course, when it comes to immigration and human rights, the internationalist ideological tradition of socialism prevents extreme nationalist and racist discourse on the far left. But, given that these parties are competing with the far right for the same disenchanted voters, their humanism on these issues has become a severe political handicap, which may explain why the extreme right has lately been more successful electorally.Meanwhile, the rise of identity-driven political movements presents a huge challenge for Europe's traditional political parties. Mainstream conservatives, widely perceived as being in thrall to the economic interests of the wealthy, must find ways to appear populist -- but without sounding too much like their far-right competitors on immigration and human rights. Cameron has succeeded in this delicate balancing act -- and has been rewarded by voters. Mainstream Republicans in the United States, pressured by the more extreme forces within their party, face a similar challenge.For center-left parties, the task is even more daunting. They must offer voters a realistic economic program that is market-friendly and open to international trade, while promising tangible benefits to the poorer 60-70 percent of the population who are understandably frustrated with their lack of economic progress. If a left party's economic policy is perceived as a weak copy of the right's agenda, the poorest segments of the population will gravitate to chauvinist forces and their false promises of protection from the consequences of globalization.The upcoming elections in Spain, Turkey, Denmark and Portugal -- not to mention next year's U.S. presidential election -- will present their own versions of these challenges. The left, in particular, will have to defend the principles of equality and democracy, while finding ways to manage irreversible globalization, including through international cooperation. The great paradox is that if the rise of identity politics continues, governments will be even less able to address the problems that are fueling it.© Project Syndicate"

In fact, the business of video game music has been around for quite some time. Who could forget everyone's favorite, catchy Super Mario Bros. tune?In recent years, the multibillion-dollar game industry has attracted a growing number of game music composers, in addition to shining a spotlight on a few previously unknown (by mainstream standards) veterans in the business. Such is the case of Finnish composer Ari Pulkkinen whose success with the Angry Birds theme song catapulted him into an elite stratosphere in the game music world, and beyond when the London Philharmonic Orchestra played the song to a live audience. Pulkkinen's subsequent success has since led to the launch of his own label, AriTunes Records.With the release of ZORG's futuristic racing game, AG Drive (the number one racing game in the U.S. this year) comes Pulkkinen's master compilation of energy-driven, electronic dance music (EDM) songs that lean toward the genre's trance, psytrance and dupstep sounds. Of the album's 14 songs, Pulkkinen's ""Drive"" mix serves as the soundtrack's lead single and offers a pulsating rhythm with powerful beats that drive the heart of the game and could easily motivate the listener to dance.Joining Pulkkinen on this collection of high-energy songs are some of Finland's top DJs, EDM creators, and video game music producers, including Little Bitchard, Tommy Baynen, City Cat, Burt Kane, Domestic Machine Movement, Tommi Salomaa, and the classically trained composer Jonne Valtonen — who also recorded arrangements for Final Fantasy.Fusing the album's futuristic sounds with the addition of a melodic vocal arrangement, Valtonen's ""They Call Me Steve,"" is a progressive house mix that also introduces one of the characters available for play. This haunting track is one that's bound to get stuck on the brain and set on repeat. The Domestic Machine Movement's ""Delta Course"" track offers an old-school video game sound with robotic vocals, while Tommy Baynen's active trance track ""Rock That"" is about as radio-play-worthy as any EDM track can get. The latter is one that would no doubt work party-goers up during the summer.Overall, the AG Drive Soundtrack is infused with the right combination of ingredients to entice both video game fanatics and electronic music fans, whether they're one-in-the-same or not. Be advised, after listening to this album, a fan of one, may easily become a follower of the other — the end result of a trance-like pull one can only assume Pulkkinen may have intended.To learn more about the album and other AriTunes Records' music, visit: www.aritunesrecords.com"

In fact, the international legitimacy that Iranian leaders are gaining from the negotiations bears much-more-positive consequences for Tehran's strategic geopolitical and military designs in the Middle East.At the beginning of this year, Sergei Shoigu became the first Russian Minister of Defense to visit Tehran in 15 years. Then, in April, Russian President Vladimir Putin paved the way for delivering a missile system to Iran by lifting a ban on the sale of sophisticated Russian air-defense missiles to Tehran. The ban had been imposed in 2010 as a result of UN Security Council resolutions, as well as pressure and lobbying from the United States and Israel. Nevertheless, Iran's military power and the Russian-Iranian partnership have shifted since the P5+1 and Iran reached a framework for a final nuclear deal.Rise in the Russian-Iranian Partnership For Iranian leaders the progress in the nuclear talks can significantly increase their geopolitical and economic influence in the region through global trade that could bolster Tehran's military power. For example, the S-300 surface-to-air missile system can provide the Islamic Republic with a powerful deterrence against any air strikes (including from ballistic missiles or cruise missiles) against their nuclear sites. In addition, the arms sale could embolden Iran to scuttle the foreign-policy objectives of its rivals -- including regional state actors and the United States -- in the region.For Russian leaders it is crucial to be ahead of the game when a final nuclear deal is reached between the P5+1 nations and Iran. Taking action will ensure that Moscow can reap a significant amount of trade profits (whether militarily or non-militarily) from Iran. For instance, Russia has long been negotiating to intensify its oil-for-goods barter deal with Tehran. Moscow can place its military deals with Tehran based on the oil-for-goods exchange program. This will provide Russian leaders with a leg up in Iran's energy and financial markets before the final nuclear deal is signed.Since a framework for a final nuclear has been reached, several powers will feel the urge to immediately intensify trade (including arms, goods, and oil) with Iran. Before European countries can tap into Iran's market, Russia is attempting to secure its profits from its arms client (Iran), maintain its strategic alliance with Iran, reassert its military cooperation with Tehran, and enjoy a significant share in Iran's market. Russia's Ministry of Defense has stated that Moscow is ready to strike the arms deal, which is worth approximately $800 million. In other words, the prospect of a final nuclear deal has prompted a race among several countries to benefit from the easing of UN Security Council sanctions against Iran. A competition to secure trade with Iran has already been initiated. And Russia, a long-term strategic ally of the Islamic Republic, would not desire to fall behind. As Andrei A. Klimov, the deputy chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in the Federation Council (Russia's Senate), told The New York Times, ""We need to think about the future of our trade partnership [with Iran]. We don't want to wait for anybody else. It is a kind of competition, if you like.""Iran would welcome any military deal that could further advance its regional hegemonic ambitions. As Iran's deputy defense minister, Reza Talaienik, told the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency in response to Russia's decision to lift the ban on missile sales, ""If Russia fulfills its commitment to deliver the S-300 missile system to Iran, it will be a step towards boosting the relations and collaborations between the two countries. It will be a step forward.""In addition, as Tehran is considered a strategic ally of Moscow, bolstering Iran's military power will further advance Russia's strategic geopolitical objectives in the region. The heightened tensions between the Obama administration and President Putin pushed Moscow much closer to the Islamic Republic as well.No Opposition From the West; Moderation in Iran's Regional Policies?Although some experts, policy analysts, and politicians might argue that Russia's move would complicate the nuclear talks, it is unlikely that the Obama administration or Western allies would scuttle the final nuclear deal because of an Iran-Russia arms deal.The recent developments clearly indicate that Iranian leaders will not moderate their objective of regional preeminence or scale down their military influence over other countries in the region. It appears that the easing of sanctions will be utilized by Iranian leaders to further invest in their country's military and ratchet up Iran's strategic geopolitical and economic influence in the Middle East.Russia and the Iran have leveraged the international legitimacy that the Islamic Republic has gained from the nuclear talks to strengthen their strategic defense ties. This international legitimacy will not only bolster Iran's military power, which would further destabilize the region and pose security concerns for other regional state actors, but will set off a global race to increase trade with Iran, including trade in arms.Majid Rafizadeh, an American scholar and political scientist, is the president of the International American Council on the Middle East.

8,POLITICS,Craft Breweries In North Carolina Face Stout Political Opposition To Expansion Efforts,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beer-distribution-_n_7226056.html,,2015-05-12,"This April 19, 2015 photo shows a blackboard listing craft brews available at Wedge Brewing in the River Arts District of Asheville, N.C. The area is home to more than 180 artists who have studios and shops in old warehouses and factories. Wedge Brewing is one of a number of places to eat and drink around the vibrant neighborhood on the French Broad River. (AP Photo/Beth J. Harpaz)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f5ef25000094003a5d9c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"North Carolina’s craft beer advocates achieved a significant victory in 2005 when the “Pop the Cap” coalition convinced state legislators to raise the limit on alcohol content for beer and other malt beverages sold in the state from six to 15 percent. The battle inspired some strange bedfellows. Independent wholesale beer and wine distributors opposed raising the limit, fearing that stronger beers would interfere with their sales of fortified wine, while conservative religious groups were concerned about loosened morality. On the other side were libertarians who saw the limit as an unnecessary restriction on personal enterprise, liberal beer enthusiasts who wanted to drink higher-quality brews, and entrepreneurs who predicted that lifting the cap would be a step towards making North Carolina the beer capital of the South. Since that fight, the number of craft breweries based in the state has risen dramatically. When Pop the Cap began its campaign in 2003, there were 25 breweries in North Carolina; now, there are 130. National craft brewing powerhouses like California’s Sierra Nevada and Colorado’s New Belgium have built facilities in or near the beer-packed city of Asheville, while others, like Oregon’s Deschutes, are contemplating similar moves. But North Carolina’s craft breweries are now once again facing off against wholesalers over another obstacle to their continued growth: the so-called three-tier system, a legacy of Prohibition. Under the system, breweries can only distribute up to a certain number of barrels of beer each year on their own before they must turn over their products to wholesalers, who then distribute the beer to retailers. North Carolina's self-distribution cap of 25,000 barrels a year, which was instituted in 2003 and was originally meant to prevent monopolies and overconsumption, has become a major source of frustration for smaller brewers. The fight over self-distribution limits is a partial result of craft breweries' growing share of the total beer market. While the craft beer industry is growing at a healthy clip, production by major companies like Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors is down. Wholesalers fear that raising the self-distribution cap could be a step toward eliminating the three-tier system in North Carolina, which could lead those large companies to withdraw their business and sell to retailers directly. In the process, the wholesalers point out, smaller breweries could also get crowded out.Fearing a loss of future business, wholesalers have developed a number of arguments against increasing the self-distribution cap. They have suggested that raising the barrel limit would threaten jobs and that state excise taxes are collected more efficiently under the current system. ""We feel the current level is exceedingly generous and more permissive than any other state in the Southern U.S.,"" Tim Kent, executive director of the North Carolina Beer and Wine Wholesalers Association, told The Associated Press. But craft brewers say that having more freedom than breweries in Georgia and Alabama isn't enough, pointing out that thirteen states have no self-distribution cap, while another dozen or so have caps set higher than North Carolina's. “To me that’s like being the best of the worst -- when you look at craft brewing around the country, it’s no surprise that the Southern states tend to be much more restrictive toward craft breweries,” said Margo Metzger, executive director of the the North Carolina Craft Brewers Guild. “What we’re doing is looking at Colorado, New York, California -- states where craft beer is thriving so much more than it is here.” Metzger said North Carolina craft breweries should have the opportunity “to become the next national brand.”“We feel like we’d have a much better shot if the small brewers were allowed to grow based on business sense and not based on a forced relationship,” she added. In an email to The Huffington Post, Kent offered more detail about why his association opposes increasing the self-distribution limit.""Unlike North Carolina, California, Colorado and Oregon law allows multi-national mega-breweries (e.g. Anheuser-Busch InBev) to self-distribute their own products,"" he said. ""'Branch-owned' distribution discourages product variety and it reduces consumer choice in the marketplace. Branch-owned distribution also eliminates jobs by locally-owned independent distributors. History has proven that those jobs are not replaced but eliminated."" Thanks to lobbying and large-scale political spending on behalf of the wholesalers, who have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to lawmakers from both parties, legislation that would deliver the brewers' wishes has repeatedly been squashed. Several bills that would have adjusted the cap upwards have been introduced -- by Republicans, who control both chambers of the General Assembly -- but they haven't even received consideration in committee.Now, craft brewers must decide on a way forward. Should they emulate the wholesalers by committing funds to play in elections, or should they continue with their grassroots strategy, though it hasn’t yet yielded results? “We’re at this weird inflection point where we have to decide whether we’re going to play the game or not, whether we’re going to lobby and exert our political capital and create a PAC,” Sean Wilson, the owner of Durham’s Fullsteam Brewery and one of the first Pop the Cap campaigners, told HuffPost. “I think we’re stronger by being the grassroots, by defying the rules, by not playing the game because if we try, we don’t have the resources. [The distributors] are wealthy because of government protection. So can we win the money game? Probably not. But we can absolutely win the PR game.” Though Fullsteam isn’t close to hitting the self-distribution cap, Wilson said his quarrel with the wholesalers is as much about philosophical opposition to unnecessary government regulations as it is about the practical implications of the limit. “We really rely on wholesalers -- they’re not all of the same ilk, so I don’t mean to throw them under the bus -- but their association will manufacture fear in an attempt to keep the status quo,” he said, adding, “I’m less likely to work with a wholesaler because they’ve created fear and anxiety where it didn’t need to exist.” As a handful of North Carolina breweries, like NoDa in Charlotte, approach the cap, they are grappling with whether to limit production to avoid turning their beer over to distributors. The brewery, which makes the 2014 World Beer Cup Gold Award winner “Hop, Drop ‘n Roll,” currently produces about 15,000 barrels a year. However, it is opening a new facility that could push it past the limit.“We would rather produce 24,999 barrels and control our distribution, control our brand and the way our brand is handled with restaurants and grocery stores than to produce more and lose the ability to have any control or any say at all,” NoDa owner Todd Ford told HuffPost. “We’re new to this game, so this will take some time. The wholesalers have had a presence for many years, they’ve been successful with raising money and relationships. We need to do the same and we plan on doing that.” Leah Wong Ashburn, the president of Highland Brewing, one of the state's largest craft breweries, said she agreed fellow brewers should be able to self-distribute more than 25,000 barrels a year, even though her brewery signed on with a distributor before it hit that mark.""We made the decision to go with the distributors long before we had to. We didn't want to be in the distribution business -- it's complicated, it's expensive, and there are folks who can do it better,"" she said, adding that she thought distributors were mistaking the drive to raise the limit for an attempt to abolish the independent distributor system altogether. The brewers’ distribution push has picked up some fans along the way. Alex Johnson, the North Carolina director of Generation Opportunity, a youth-oriented group linked to the billionaire conservative industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch, wrote an op-ed about the brewery issue last year, in which he argued that the state government shouldn’t suppress entrepreneurship. “It’s embarrassing for Republicans to run on free-market principles and then, once they get elected, to turn their back on the free-market system and use government to destroy business,” Johnson told HuffPost. “These are archaic laws from the Prohibition era --- maybe the problem is we have legislators from the Prohibition era.” Republican state Rep. Chuck McGrady, who sponsored one of the defeated bills this session that would have modified the self-distribution limit, said it was disappointing to see his fellow GOP legislators opposed to reforming the state's ""arcane laws.""“Philosophically we’re about competition and small business and that’s what the craft brewers are about,” said McGrady, who was instrumental in bringing Sierra Nevada to North Carolina. “It's not like we’re trying to take the cap off, we’re just trying to have an incremental change because the world of brewing is very different now from what it was like even a decade ago.” This story has been updated to include comment from Kent."
9,PARENTS,To Vaccinate or Not to Vaccinate: Why Is That Even a Question?,"Gabrielle Van Tassel, ContributorTraveler, writer, musician, athlete, feminist.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/to-vaccinate-or-not-to-vaccinate-why-is-that-even-a-question_b_7201748.html,"Parents who argue, ""My child doesn't need to be vaccinated because of herd immunity,"" lack foresight.

In 2000 the CDC declared measles eliminated in the U.S. But the highly contagious disease returned and infected over 100 patients, ranging from infants to adults. Measles is so contagious that if one person is infected, 90 percent of non-vaccinated or non-immune people in close proximity will contract it. This most recent outbreak shows just how resilient and opportunistic infectious diseases are.Yet the number of unvaccinated people in the United States continues to grow, increasing the risk of a full-blown epidemic of measles.Like the widespread concern about genetically and chemically modified foods, a rising fear of vaccinations drives this refusal to vaccinate, because vaccines are made from chemicals and contain an inert virus. Among many chemicals contained in vaccines, thiomersal --a mercury-based organic compound used to prevent microbial growth-- is a primary target for anti-vaccine activists. Fears over elemental mercury's effects as a neurotoxin fueled the FDA's 1999 requirement to reduce thiomersal in vaccines, as a precautionary measure. But the worry about thiomersal is as ridiculous as thinking sodium chloride -- table salt -- is poisonous because it contains chlorine.In recent years, a growing number of parents have refused to vaccinate their children. These parents are often libertarians who disagree with government involvement in child rearing, or religious groups who reject vaccinations because they are man-made, not God-given. For some parents the appeal of all-natural diets and the misconception that vaccinations are equivalent to processed foods keeps them from immunizing their kids. Celebrity parents like Jenny McCarthy loudly publicize their decision not to vaccinate. This drives the movement among tabloid-reading parents with an eye for hip lifestyle changes, who may see a celebrity as a credible source of information.The debate on vaccinating children is not new -- concerns about their efficacy and safety have been around since the first smallpox vaccine in 1798. But the recent trend gets momentum from a now-discredited paper published in 1998 that linked vaccine administration to increased rates of autism and colitis. Andrew Wakefield, the study's principal investigator, had a conflict of interest, because a group interested in pursuing litigation against vaccine manufacturers funded his study. Wakefield also submitted a patent for what he claimed was a safer measles vaccine several months before his paper was published, raising questions about his motives and the integrity of the study. Even though the data was manipulated and the paper's findings have never been replicated, the paranoia over autism-inducing vaccines remains.In California this past year, ""measles parties"" or ""pox parties"" threatened to make a comeback. Before the chickenpox vaccine was introduced in 1995, parents planned social events to expose children to the disease in hopes that they would become infected, recover, and gain immunity. While it was an effective strategy then, it is ridiculous to intentionally infect children rather than take preventative steps that are readily available, safe and inexpensive.Parents who argue, ""My child doesn't need to be vaccinated because of herd immunity,"" lack foresight. Some patients are too young to be immunized for certain diseases: the MMR vaccine cannot be administered before 12 months. Others with allergic reactions to vaccines or compromised immune systems can never be vaccinated, and must rely on the immunity of others to keep them healthy. Rejecting the pediatrician's recommendation to vaccinate is a parent's prerogative, which is fine if the family lives in isolation. Otherwise, they are jeopardizing the immediate and long-term health of those around them."

The following is what I discovered:6 commercials about other TV shows 4 Food Commercials 7 commercials about toys 6 commercials about various video games and apps 0 commercials about booksThe question of why our kids are not reading for pleasure is not a new one, but there is no easy answer. All we can do is speculate. For example: • Kids don't read for pleasure because they are distracted by TV.  • Kids don't read for pleasure because they are more interested in video games.  • Kids don't read for pleasure because there is too much technology (social media) in their life. • Kids don't read for pleasure because they no longer can use their imagination to create their own movie in their head.Perhaps parents need to have their children earn TV time by reading first. Perhaps teachers need to include reading for pleasure as a part of their homework or school expectation. Authors need to compete with the movie industry. Books need to be as cool as the movies. Authors need to advertise their books on that children's TV channel.Parents become a prime motivator for their children to read for pleasure and become lifelong readers. I would advise parents to be a reading example for their kids. So many parents share that they just don't have time to read for pleasure, or they only read after the children go to bed, or they only read in the bathroom. It is conceivable that a child could go from sun up to sun down and never see the most important adults in their life read a book for pleasure. Yet, parents are constantly telling their children how important it is to read. Perhaps our children perceive a double standard. I would advise that parents make reading a priority in their homes. Sit down and discuss the book that your child is reading. How do they think it will end? What is their favorite part so far? Who is the author?Once again, there is no easy answer for encouraging our children to read, but the fact remains that we need to get our children reading! Kids will do things if it is popular, cool, or fun. We need to make reading all three of those and the best way to do that is through... technology!Let them read their books online. Let them read a graphic novel from their tablet or laptop. Let them use Book Wizard (http://www.scholastic.com/bookwizard/) which is sort of a Pandora Music App but for Children and Young Adult Books. Let them go on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/user/polandbananasBOOKS) and watch book talks from other kids and help them find a good book that they might enjoy reading. Let them discuss what they have read with someone online, either in a book club chatroom( http://www.epals.com/#!/main) or have them write a critique of the book on a blog. All of these possibilities will make reading fun and highly motivating for our children. There is one thing that must come first before any reluctant reader finds his/her passion for reading. There has to be someone who guides them to discovery. The sheer definition of reluctant tells us that there must be at least one person who helps the child find that first book.... that person must guide them to the pathway that can help them discover a love of reading. It just takes one person. Will you be the one?"

Someone needed to show them that they do matter!LC: Do you believe it is equally important to nurture your child's education and their passions?ML: I believe in order for your child to be better prepared for life a certain level of education is needed. We are a technology driven-society; everything is electronic. This is the strongest employment sector, outside of medical. I always encourage them to have a backup plan. Anything can happen. You must be able to care for yourself and a family. Teaching them to be humble is most important to me.LC: Share a few strategies a mom can take in order to support her children's future and support herself in the process.ML: Take time to listen to your children's fears and dreams. Understand what is important to them and why. Open the lines of communication with them trust and respect will be deepened for you as a parent overall. Assist them with setting a path of direction for their goals. Your support will reinforce their beliefs of achievement. Explain to them that a ""no"" or a failure is just as much a part of any success, because it creates tenacity. As a mother, you always want to protect your children and help them to avoid obvious pitfalls, but shielding them is a setup for failure. There are lessons to be learned from adversity and obstacles.LC: What lessons did you learn personally that added value to you professionally?ML: I learned patience and not to compromise my position of power. Eagerness can be viewed as a sign of weakness and desperation. Business and personal can be a difficult balance. Each of my team members represent a weakness that I feel I have. I'm honest about what I don't know, I think it created a baseline of trust and respect among the team. I remain dedicated to the vision and acquiring knowledge about my craft. I eat it, sleep it!LC: What's next for you?ML: To create a billion dollar team! Becoming the most influential woman in Motorsports. Open opportunities to other women, lectures of empowerment, give testimonials, pay my blessings forward at every opportunity and write a book. I want to use this platform I have to re establish the brilliance of our culture as a woman. I have a personal goal that is small but it will symbolize to me, my success. Create an asthma awareness that focuses on the triggers. I don't know what the future holds but I am ready for it, Let's see!LC: Leave us with one last piece of advice on fighting fear and following our dreams. ML: I encourage my children to find whatever makes them happy and go for it! Different is good, be proud to say ""I am me!"" I love to cook huge meals, create memories for my babies, bargain shop and being still!"

I wondered if my yet-to-be disclosed Judaism would be revealed before the identity of my government-required minder, the son of a famous IRGC commander and relative of some of the most famously anti-American government and religious figures in Iran -- and, which would be considered more scandalous.My last moments in Iran were spent anxiously awaiting an exit stamp in my U.S. passport, unsure if it would be granted after weeks of moments like this, suspended somewhere between incredible and outrageous. Written and photo evidence suggested two run-ins with the secret police, many new Iranian friends, a trip inside the U.S. Den of Espionage, and visits to the nuclear sites in Natanz, which wouldn't be easily explained by a warped sense of vacation. It also didn't help that the itinerary was finalized concomitant -- and somewhat auspiciously -- with the agreement on the nuclear framework, Passover, and Nowruz, giving my minder plenty of opportunities to jokingly assign my activities and research questions on a scale of one to permanent detention at Evin Prison.  After six years of study, Iran was at once everything I had hoped and not at all what I expected -- and the entire trip was filled with these incongruities. On my connecting flight between Dubai and Tehran, Iranian women had their hijab off right up until the wheels touched the tarmac; everyone around me passed the two hours watching Two and a Half Men and other American favorites; and the minute we landed, the entire flight was on Facebook despite its blocking by the government. Following customs, which consisted of 30 minutes of fingerprinting, questioning, and jokes, I began discovering one of the most unknowable, perplexing, and misperceived countries on earth, populated by an incredibly inviting, informed, proud, and curious people.Everyone I met, including my minder, wanted to know about American perceptions of Iran, the desire to travel to their country considering the West's portrayal of it, our understanding and conflation of terrorism with Islam, what the future of Iran-US relations might look like, generational differences in knowledge of the Middle East, and surely equally significant, about Western social customs, particularly what parties are like, how girls and boys meet each other and where they hang out, and about our freedoms off and online. I probed young people on Rouhani, Ahmadinejad, and Khatami; life in an Islamic theocratic republic and how their parents spoke about Iran before the revolution; their thoughts on Israel, the United States, and the Islamic State; other geopolitical priorities including their opinions of Iran's nuclear aspirations and the nuclear/sanctions deal (reinforced by fireworks and street celebrations upon the initial framework agreement!); if they wanted to communicate with their peers in the West; and their tech savvy considering expansive media censorship and how that affected the information they received or sought out.Their ability to speak with incredible nuance about the division and divergence between governments, cultures, and peoples was particularly striking: the young Iranians I spoke with insisted on separating Americans from the opinions and actions of our government, Jews from the State of Israel, Islamic extremism from at least Shia Islam, and Iranians from the Islamic Republic. We were equally frustrated by the way our media have reduced us to data points and products of our governments' foreign policies; we were similarly excited by a future of improved connectivity and access following adoption of the nuclear/sanctions agreement.A lack of choice in all aspects of their public lives -- from fashion to the ability to travel -- is their primary frustration with the post-1979 regime, but they insist neither the sanctions nor clerics have affected their ability to live freely in their private lives. This was never more clear than at a birthday party I was invited to where they showed me iPhones with VPNs to prove they could friend or follow me or Hillary Clinton on social media, sipped Coca-Colas mixed with smuggled or bathtub-brewed alcohol, and wore recognizably branded miniskirts with tight tops -- though all of these activities are illegal.Other moments suggested a delicate push to live their private existences in public- sometimes. A few of my favorite experiences revolved around learning about dating in a country where it is forbidden. Dor dor, drive-by dating, is a favorite method whereby 20-something males pull up in burned out Peugeots next to girls batting their eyelashes, exchange contacts, and meet at Si-o-Seh Pol in Esfahan, Eram Garden in Shiraz, Milad Tower in Tehran, or a more private spot. To understand this concept more, some friends brought me to a concert beneath a bridge where young couples were enjoying each other's company, just barely out of sight from the Disciplinary Force of the Islamic Republic. The activities and views of the under-30s, which make up more than half of Iran's nearly 80 million population, were fascinating and contextualized by conversations with adults -- those who had lived through the 1979 Islamic Revolution and could offer a fuller perspective. Although many I spoke to were not ready for another revolution and could not imagine another 'failed' attempt at transformation like the 2009 Green Movement, they were concerned about the sustainability of Iran's isolation from the West, the hard-liners' loudspeaker, and limited space for civil society.Similarly, but more shockingly, the clerics I spoke to in Kashan could not see how the current balance of religion, politics, and society could be maintained, and foresaw upcoming dissonance and pressure for increased liberalization as relations between the West and Iran began to thaw. The Jews I met with in Esfahan also recognized society hanging in the balance of a severe regional politicization of religion, particularly in Israel and Iran, but did not consider this personally concerning, reminding me of the important delineation between Jewish and Israeli. After discussing Palestine, the treatment of Jews in Iran before and after the revolution, as well as during Ahmadinejad's regime versus today, and how incredible it would be if more Jewish Americans traveled to Iran, one young Jewish woman said almost too sardonically, ""l'shanah haba'ah b'yerushalayim,"" -- next year in Jerusalem.The Iran we read about exists: Dissent often leads to arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment, many civil and political rights are neither valued nor protected, and violations of certain laws even yield punishment by hanging; the former U.S. Embassy is a monument to the ""Down with USA and Israel"" minority, and despite a reformist president, the clerical establishment retains profuse control and high visibility. But, there is also an Iran that we don't read about -- a reality that requires more attention and caution when we haphazardly define the majority of Iranians in terms of domestic and multilateral policies or by the projected opinions of the Ayatollahs.Despite more than 30 years of seclusion and censorship, the majority of Iranians seem to be curious, open-minded, and eagerly seeking connection with Americans. The last words out of the border guard's mouth as he stamped my passport -- like almost every other Iranian I met -- was to please share my experience in Iran as honestly as Iranians had shared their country with me."

We are treated to 87 minutes of spectacular vistas, ignorance and poverty, ferocious brutality, disarming innocence, utter despair, and genuine, unaffected honesty.  (Rumer Willis and Veronica Cartwright)Twenty-six-year-old Rumer Willis, who's presently wowing all of America on Dancing With The Stars, delivers an exquisite performance as Maya, a young woman, battered and bruised and at the very end of her rope, who meets Duncan, an autistic young man perfectly portrayed by Chris Marquette, when she steals his truck, which also turns out to be his home. At first blush, it's easy to assume that Maya, being the 'normal' one of the two, would become the caregiver, leaving Duncan to become the 'cared-for', but as the story progresses and the relationship forms, the question of who's helping whom shifts to and fro.   (Rumer Willis and Chris Marquette)That shifting back and forth is well-illustrated when they encounter a particularly despicable lout played brilliantly by veteran actor Dave Vescio. No spoilers here ... but the very realistic dynamics of this fast-moving scene, the quick role-reversals back and forth, how each in turn, and in their own way, steps in to save the other, is what makes this movie work so well: it is neither improbable nor stereotypical in its expectation of how each character handles the challenges and brick walls they encounter throughout the film.  (Dave Vescio and Chris Marquette)I spoke with Dave Vescio about his role, and he was quite candid about his rather colorful background. ""But,"" he said, ""That's the reason I 'get it', why I understand people who commit crimes. Hollywood plays villains one-dimensionally, and that doesn't help anyone. I want to bring that truth to the world, warn women and kids about the real tell-tale signs. This film throws out a lot of honesty -- and that's why I love the indies!""Additionally, unlike Rajeev, Dave does  have a personal connection to a developmentally disabled child. ""We live in a culture where we judge people in the first twenty seconds -- that's just so wrong.""    The research required to make this film so deeply affected Rajeev that it impacted every aspect of the story he wrote and the characters he created. No surprise there -- that happens all the time with writers. But what does not always happen, although it is always the goal, is that the characters and their actions are so true-to-life, that the actors themselves are completely drawn into the story, and the result is that the audience is, as well.   (Rumer Willis)Rajeev began his research at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX, where he met families whose children's autism ranged the spectrum, high to low. ""I spoke with the families,"" Rajeev said, ""I went into their homes, interacted with the children, got an immersive experience of what it's like, how it effects the family dynamic, the concerns, but also the gifts. All the children had a sense of spirit, an air of joy and excitement about them, because they themselves were not hampered by the label."" Unlike a child who is, say, wheelchair-bound or enduring a life-threatening illness like cancer, the children Rajeev got to know were quite unaware of being 'different'. ""They were not walking around thinking, Oh, my God, I have autism!  They were just living life.""   One boy was in diapers, exhibited the characteristic repetitious gestures, and was completely non-verbal. ""It was like he was in his own bubble."" But on Rajeev's last day, he told the child, ""Ricky, I'm going home now,"" and to everyone's amazement, including the boy's parents, Ricky patted Rajeev's shoulder, acknowledging a genuine human connection.

But do we really need courage to have a conversation?Curiously I know many people who have the leadership courage to engage in risky ventures, heroic quests, and brave actions and yet lack the relationship courage to initiate and engage in meaningful conversations with the people who matter most to them - family members, business partners, employees, investors, and others. I regard Courage as a vital component of Conversational Intelligence because, by definition, courage deals with matters of the heart (the word courage derives from Latin cor, meaning heart, having the inner strength to share innermost feelings, to speak your mind, openly and honestly, by speaking from your heart.Every conversation has a physiological impact. As we converse, neurochemicals are released in our brains, making us feel either good or bad, strong or weak, positive or negative, energetic or enervated. Feel-good conversations keep the blood flowing, the energy pumping, and light up our ability to see the world in new ways.With Conversational Intelligence, you can know which conversations trigger lower-level brain activity - such as primitive instincts for fight, flight, freeze and appeasement - and which ones spark higher-level brain activity, such as trust, integrity, strategic thinking, empathy, and the ability to process complex situations.How can you summon your courage to engage in conversations that improve your relationships and your results? Here are three steps you can take to create quality conversations.1. Set rules of engagement.  If you're heading into a conversation or confrontation that could get testy, start by outlining rules of engagement. Have everyone suggest ways to make it a productive, inclusive conversation and note the ideas. You might agree to give people extra time to explain their ideas and to listen without judgment. These practices will counteract the tendency to fall into harmful conversational patterns. Afterwards, consider see how you and the group did and seek to do even better next time.2. Listen with empathy. In one-on-one conversations, make a conscious effort to speak less and listen more. The more you learn about other peoples' perspectives, the more likely you are to feel empathy for them. And when you do that for others, they'll want to do it for you, creating a virtuous circle.3. Plan who speaks.  In situations when you know one person is likely to dominate a group, create an opportunity for everyone to speak. Ask all parties to identify who in the room has important information, perspectives, or ideas to share. List them and the areas they should speak about on a flip chart and use that as your agenda, opening the floor to different speakers, asking open-ended questions and taking notes.When you converse with courage, you gain access to the brain's prefrontal cortex, or executive functions, which allow for sophisticated strategies. You can then respond intelligently and creatively to investors, banks or customers, without feeling fear, freezing, or becoming defensive, protective, or argumentative. You can pay attention to what is going on in others and manifest empathy. The other person will feel that positive neural connection and cooperate. We are wired with mirror neurons that pick up signals in others' brains. When we approach people with empathy, the mirror neurons in their brains synch with our own, and they feel understood and open to our influence.So, raise the bar in your conversations - put your intelligence in action by summoning and showing your courage.

22,ARTS,"Mr. Biesenbach, Why Giving a Retrospective to Yoko Ono Instead of Fluxus (Whom She Copies) at MOMA?","Rodrigo Cañete, ContributorAuthor and Blogger at loveartnotpeople.uk/.org",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mr-biesenbach-why-giving-_b_7253394.html,Yoko Ono claims to be one of the pioneers of performance art but the truth is that her art is a conflation of 'ready-made' indexicality and a projection of her own persona into that same indexicality.,2015-05-12,2015-05-11-1431302821-2018487-10yokojp4articlelarge.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-11-1431302821-2018487-10yokojp4articlelarge-thumb.jpg,"It seems that the marriage between celebrity and museums is on the verge of taking its first casualty if the upcoming 'Yoko Ono: One Woman Show, 1960-1970' at MoMA does not prove to be a rotund success. At the center of the controversy, there is star-curator Klaus Biesenbach whose career is in danger after a succession of curatorial failure which culminated with Björk's monographic exhibition.Yoko Ono claims to be one of the pioneers of performance art but the truth is that her art is a conflation of 'ready-made' indexicality and a projection of her own persona into that same indexicality. For decades Yoko Ono has not truly been taken seriously as an artist. Derivative of Marcel Duchamp and unwilling to go to the physical extremes explored by the younger Marina Abramovic, Yoko Ono's career is slightly monotonous and lazy. In fact, the only reason why Yoko Ono has been accepted as a canonic artist is because of her celebrity status and eccentric (thumbs-up-peace-and-love) persona.Opening on May 17 in one of MoMA's sixth-floor galleries, her show should be considered as one of the major events of the museum's summer season. On display will be more than 100 vintage works -- and in a few cases, facsimiles -- that represent the heyday of Ono's first career in art, long overshadowed by her better-known image as pop-culture icon after her marriage to John Lennon.According to Biesenbach, this is the case because for ""Yoko Ono in the '60s was a historically important, groundbreaking, influential artist, working in London and Tokyo and New York'. Her achievements as an artist have been 'nearly hidden by her fame; we want to uncover it.' But what makes Ono's conceptualism as relevant as to dedicate a whole floor to it? Why her and not other far more relevant conceptualist practitioners?Yoko Ono has constructed artistic identity as a 'radical artist'.

This is not foreign to the kind of curating that Klaus Biesenbach and Hans Obrist Ulrich have been trying to canonise both at PS1 MoMA and at the Serpentine Gallery in London. In fact, Hans Obriest' Do-It-Yourself book is, almost literally, plagiarised from Fluxus.It is from this point of view that I find it relevant to ask whether this sudden canonisation of Yoko Ono at MoMA is part of the curatorial 'artistry' that celebrity curators like Biesenbach and Obrist Ulrich have been trying to claim for themselves? So is Yoko Ono the vortex that might transform celebrity curators into creators?Of course, this might happen in the media because at the exhibition there won't be much to show. Upon arrival, visitors to the MoMA exhibition will encounter her 'Apple' (1966) which is a ready made object composed of a 'perfectly normal Granny Smith, shiny, green apple'. This 'object' would have had a different meaning were it made after the appearance of Apple Inc. But in 1966, it is a bad allusion to one of Marcel Duchamp's ready mades. Then there will be objects from Ono's 1961 show with Fluxus, reproduced as facsimiles because the originals have mostly been lost. The centrepiece of this show will be the re-enacting of her performance 'Cut Piece' which Ono first staged in Japan soon after her post natal depression. The work required the audience to snip of her clothes with scissors. After Abramovic and Björk, Biesenbach's endorsement of Yoko Ono's career over Fluxus reveals a particular taste for woman's victimhood. I wonder whether Biesenbach's taste is shaped by an Aedipical drive that makes all women detached, authoritative, slightly clownish and on the verge of a nervous breakdown. "

25,BUSINESS,"Capitalize on the ""We"" Space to Grow Your Business","Janine Garner, ContributorEntrepreneur, author, speaker, trainer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/capitalise-on-the-we-spac_b_7253372.html,SMEs are often seen as sitting in a slightly isolationist position within the general business environment.,2015-05-12,2015-05-11-1431302533-9158568-JigsawPuzzlePiece.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-11-1431302533-9158568-JigsawPuzzlePiece-thumb.jpg," SMEs are often seen as sitting in a slightly isolationist position within the general business environment. This isn't surprising; most SMEs are the creation of a single entrepreneur, or perhaps a partnership, and as a result have an understandably inward looking approach to the way they operate - and also a flat management structure.The focus is on 'my' creation. But the world is changing. Demand for better and faster product delivery, improvement in product offering, innovation in concepts and constant reinvention across all industries and sectors characterises the way business is being run in the digiworld. Those with bigger capabilities are winning.This means that those SMEs who are willing to embrace a collaborative approach at a commercial level - what I refer to in my book ""From Me To We"" as the 'We space' - are able to capitalise on shared capabilities. Working together to share ideas, concepts, skills - sometimes even physical space - and intellectual property, is an invaluable chance for expansion, and of course as a result, revenue increase.So what are some cost-effective and reasonable ways for savvy SMEs to capitalise on the 'We' space and make the most of commercial collaboration?1. Make sure you are leading a team, not a group of people working in the same building: often SMEs fall into the trap of one person with a vision, plus X number of support people who just happen to carry out required tasks. If you want to expand, you need to involve your staff at the decision-making level. Trust engenders trust, excitement, and energy - which in turn engenders an upturn in productivity, both mental and fiscal.2. Think fast: do you know who your competitors are? Do you know who their teams are? Their 2ICs? Their network affiliations? Are you sitting in the right place within your market share? Expansion is only a possibility if you have done your research in the first place.3. Look at sharing space: if you are a business that trades in ideas rather than commodities, or if your production is based offshore or off-premises, then look at hot-desking or entering into a creative space with other SMEs. Creative spaces are a fantastic way to not only cur down on overheads, they actually encourage collaboration on a commercial level, as businesses not only bounce ideas off each other but tend to pass leads, clients and opportunities to each other - particularly within the same sector. For example, an advertising agency, a social media consultancy, a copywriting team, and a photographic studio - imagine the commercial opportunities if these were all under the same creative roof?4. Establish an 'intelligence bank' with other SMEs: seek out businesses that complement your company's skill set. For example, if you are producing disposable plastic bottles, look for a design studio and an online marketing company. Establish an exchange of skills/services in return for cross-promotional opportunities and the chance to gain new sector exposure. Often SMEs are cash-poor and ability rich. Working collaboratively in this way means an eventual expansion for all concerned, without financial outlay in the first instance.5. Think of commercial collaboration as 'evolution', not 'revolution': don't try to reinvent the wheel. If you are that company making plastic bottles, don't suddenly start making an app that tells people where they can buy your plastic bottles, or how to shoot plastic bottles off a wall. Instead, much as Coke have done, collaborate with your new 'intelligence partner' the design studio, and use their skills to demonstrate to people how to recycle your plastic bottles into cool things. It may not seem you will sell as many - but your profile is raised, and therefore your revenue will also be on the upswing."

It became the norm in our house to neatly fold hand-me-downs because some customer could surely use them. These visits also turned into something else. She became a trusted confidant and somewhat of a philanthropist; an interesting blend of self-care and compassion. Recently, when I was asked to participate in a local No Make-Up book project by photographer Steve Osemwenkhae, I was downright perplexed.

When I was sent the close up images, in color and black and white, I could only bear a nanosecond glance.I mustered the courage much later and revisited the photos with the intent to just sit with my feelings.

I don't spend much energy comparing myself to others. But looking at the photos and seeing the emerging cobwebs of my aging face - finely pixilated, in high definition - was brutal. And there was no ""after photo"" to accompany them. I wanted to compare these photos to the 'me' I imagined myself to be. She wasn't there. I began to sweat. My heart thumped. My mind did a reverse flashback, like a near-death experience. I tunneled through almost a half of century of my life. ""Take some deep breaths,"" I heard a distant voice whisper. I closed my laptop.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77d7f2400003200570903.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Too slow, too fat with a limited offensive game among other things is what Draymond Green heard coming out of Michigan State. His college resumé warranted a for sure first round selection, what scouts and others around the NBA saw was a project guy without a true position, a ""tweener"" as they called it. Green is 6'8"" on a good day and coming out of MSU, he was a hefty 245-250 pounds. The next Boris Diaw seemed to be his fate. Green was already a pretty decent decision maker with the rock, he could rebound with the best of them at the college level and he was a terrific defender. Everything else was average to below average. GM Bob Myers drafted Green because he simply knew how to win. Myers said of Green after drafting him: ""He went to one of the top colleges in the country and all he did was produce and win. Sitting next to me here are three guys that win. That's what we need to do. Winning in my opinion and in our group's opinion is a skill. These players all have that skill.""Right on Bob Myers. The Warriors didn't get the Boris Diaw clone he was destined to be, or Luke Harangody. What they got was a young, sane Ron Artest with an insane desire to win and do whatever it takes to get that done on both ends on the floor with the versatility of Shawn Marion. He's even slimmed down, allowing him to be much more agile than he was.All it took was an unfortunate injury to David Lee and new head coach Steve Kerr, who once was the GM when Shawn Marion was in Phoenix to realize that Green was much too valuable to be their first or second guy off the bench. The struggles of his rookie and sophomore campaign made him better.But why Draymond Green out of all people?Offensively, Green has admirably filled the role that the Cavaliers sought out for Kevin Love, a stretch-four who is the epitome of the title, the guy who stretches the defense, pulling out bigs on defense to open up driving lanes for guards and slashing wings. It's really a match made in heaven for the Warriors offense with Green on the floor. Their starting lineup perfectly feeds off the success of the stretch-four luring opposing big men to the perimeter. While Steph Curry can pull up from anywhere on the court he can also get to anywhere his heart desires on the court, including to the rim, as with starting wing Harrison Barnes. Barnes does not necessarily look to shoot, he's more interested in slashing to the basket to put down an emphatic jam. Curry's backcourt mate, Klay Thompson is afforded more space to set defenders up for his lethal mid-range jumper when he too isn't splashing 3's. I don't want to make this sound like Draymond Green is the only reason why the Warriors offense flows so effortlessly, but he does a damn good job of keeping the train moving. He's also became a pick and pop guru, his spot up jumper is probably one of his top 3 strengths now:Statistically and realistically speaking, defense is Draymond Green's calling card. A great defender can always seem to find his way on an NBA team. Green is tasked to guard opposing teams' best threat in the post on a nightly basis and he is pretty much lights out as a post defender. Green has had no trouble guarding bigs who are either much taller, bigger or even more agile, except well, maybe Anthony Davis at times, but that's a worthy exception to make. His ability as a rim protector is statistically up there with the likes of premier rim protectors such as DeAndre Jordan and his teammate Andrew Bogut, who statistically sits as the NBA's best rim protector. Even without the height and rangy arms, Green still holds opposing bigs to mere 45% around the rim; the money area.His versatility allows the Warriors to effectively play small ball with him sometimes guarding the center, depending on opponent. This allows the Warriors to be quicker in transition off of missed buckets, or just flat out lockdown team defense. His tremendous passing ability, though not a master outlet passer like the aforementioned Love still gets the job done. Especially here after he gets everything but the two points: Since entering the league in 2012, the Michigan State product has became one of those premier defenders that is mentally and physically still polishing his offensive skill set and becoming much more confident on that end of the floor. Fans know, I know and anyone who watches basketball knows that. His minutes, points, 3P%, rebounds, assists, and many advanced metrics are here to back him up. He does all of the above at a nice clip considering the plethora of talent he's surrounded by. His ESPN real Plus/Minus rating lists him in the top 10, making him one of the most valuable players in the entire league. His WAR (Wins Above Replacement), a metric that tracks value calculated for a player is claimed to be the number of additional wins their team has achieved above the number of expected team wins if that player was substituted by a replacement level player: a player that may be added to the team for minimal cost and effort is also places him in the top 10. Analytics anyone?These advanced metrics and ways to look at and evaluate a player's statistical worth has helped under the radar players like Green receive recognition for their undeniably important value to their respective teams. Analytics has allowed us to get rid of the label that Green would otherwise have if not for analytics improving his case. Maybe something like a ""good"" but limited role player, that doesn't make a true difference. His basic statistics (points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals) are not that of a star player. Analytics is more than what meets the eye. Analytics give players like Draymond Green their props where they are rightfully due. They allow us to be critical evaluators of players. You've got to respect that.But Anyway. . .  The ""stretch-four"" has sort of became another position on the court along with my other favorites such as ""point forward."" The position is highly valued, especially by Coach Kerr. It is likely that every team in some way, shape or form has a stretch-four on their roster.Truly to a degree, Green is not undersized by today's NBA standards. Not even by his trash-talking standards, a family tradition according to Green. He's what every team needs if they had championship aspirations. That versatile, in your face glue guy who doesn't have the flashy stats, or makes the flashy plays, but the guy who can take the top off the defense like a blazing fast wide receiver, make the smart plays, coupled with preeminent defensive skills is what every team wish they had. He doesn't dominate the ball, nor create shots for himself. He just has an undying desire to win. Guys like Green are hard to find. It's going to be even harder to try to coach up the next Draymond Green. Some of what he does on the court isn't taught, it's innate. He's really earned a name for himself in this breakout season. He might even be in for a really nice payday.Too bad 29 other teams passed up this opportunity."
