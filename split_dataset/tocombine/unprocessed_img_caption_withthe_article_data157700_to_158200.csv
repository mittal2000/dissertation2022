Researchers looked at 24,000 married people and how they used 10 different media channels, including Facebook, emails, texts and instant messages. They found that those who communicated with their partner over more channels did not experience greater levels of relationship satisfaction, and some even reported decreased levels of satisfaction. In fact, couples using more than five channels reported a 14 percent drop in marriage satisfaction, according to the Daily Mail. ""This work suggests that media, which now includes online social media, still operates as a signal of ties of strength in relationships,"" Hogan said in a press release.

He underwent surgery to repair his Achilles but will his jump shot be the same? Well, that all depends on the extent of his injury. As a reconstructive foot surgeon, I can tell you that Achilles surgery ""repair"" is not as straightforward as the media seems to suggest. Most of the time, the Achilles tendon ruptures in a consistent pattern -- the surgery is straightforward as well as the rehabilitation. Sometimes the repair can be complex and can alter the surgical plan, recovery, and prognosis. There are three surgical scenarios, based on where the Achilles tendon rupture occurs:1) Centrally in the mid-substance of the tendon:  This is the most common Achilles Rupture. Here the tendon fibers separate and shred -- surgeons know this a mop-end rupture because the tendon actually looks like a mop. There is ruptured tendon on both sides of the tendon. Achilles Repair Surgery is usually straightforward. Surgeons use super strong suture in special weaving techniques to 'bunch up' and tie the tendon ends back together. Some surgeons use minimally invasive techniques but the basis of the surgery is the same. Watch Achilles Tendon Surgery Video -- click here.2) Pulled off the heel bone:  Here the Achilles is pulled off the heel bone. Surgery in this case is different because the tendon needs to be bolted back onto the heel bone. Small bone anchors (along with suture) are used to secure the tendon back to the bone.3) Shredded at the muscle-tendon junction: In this scenario, the Achilles tendons separates from the muscle a bit higher up behind the ankle. it is more challenging to repair the Achilles tendon when it's torn away from the muscle. Recovery after Achilles tendon repair:  It takes 6-8 weeks for the tendon to mend and another 2 months of physical therapy. Most surgeons today initiate an early mobilization program so long as the repair is strong, which gets people mobilized much quicker. Will Kobe Get His Jump Shot back? Hopefully for the extraordinary superstar Kobe Bryant, he had an ordinary Achilles tendon rupture and that the repair was straightforward. The good news for Kobe, is that Achilles tendon ruptures tendon tend to recover excellently. The bad news for Kobe, is that overdoing the physically therapy can stretch out his Achilles repair and weaken his calf muscle -- putting his jump shot at risk. While Kobe has a history of powering through injuries, an Achilles rupture is not one of those injuries where pushing too hard is a good thing.

She spoke with her usual complaints.But this time, she told me that she'll eventually leave her husband. ""Eventually,"" she said, she'll find another man to love.The entire conversation, for an hour straight, was all about the magic word ""eventually.""I looked into her eyes and said to her:""I love you. You're an amazing person, but you've got to lose this term 'eventually' because eventually may never come.""We went deeper.I listened to all her excuses. She, like a lot of other women, is not in love with her husband.She's got a wonderful kid.She's got a beautiful home.She has the financial freedom to be able to leave her husband.We went deep into this, and so I said,""You know, your son already knows your marriage isn't good. You're out with friends every Friday and Saturday night, your husband is out with different friends on Friday and Saturday night. What is that telling him? You're together under the same roof, but you're not together emotionally; you're not connected.""She looked at me and started crying. She said that her biggest reason is fear. Even though she was successful, even though she had a beautiful son, she lived her life in fear, and she felt like her time was past.I told her that fear is the number one reason why we don't do the things we love, that and its cousin ""eventually."" Eventually will never come. Eventually will never be there. Right now, the way you are in your life is exactly, is the best moment you are in your life. As we get older, we just age. We do.We lose our energy. (And yeah, I know that some of you are older and thinking that you're rather robust for a 65-year-old. Well, let me tell you, I'm a robust 50-year-old, but I don't have the energy that I had when I was 30.)We, every single day, wait for eventually to happen. Our ""eventually"" excuses are always the same. Eventually, I'll be able to have more money. Eventually, I'll be able to take that trip.Eventually, I'll have enough courage to go and start my business.Eventually, I'll be able to go and leave my husband, lead my life and meet somebody great.We live our life full of the word eventually.Eventually may never happen.And not to scare you, but you may get hit by a bus today, struck by lighting, go swimming in the ocean and get attacked by a shark or contract an incurable terminal disease. I hope none of that happens to you, but hey, you never know.Life is all we have in the present moment, so appreciate it every single day. When you wake up in the morning, you need to realize that today is all you have. You don't have eventually. You don't have a series of eventually.The beauty of life is today. How are you going to make the most of it?Also, who are you? It's time to start accepting yourself for who you are.So many of us are constantly pushing ourselves to the max so that our eventually is an amazing place.We're pushing ourselves all the time, trying to make our life so magical and wondrous.Some of us are chronic workaholics and don't know how to enjoy the present moment; some of us are the exact opposite and never start anything or build things for long-term use.So understand your limitations. Work on what you can work on, but accept yourself for who you are -- who you are right now is exactly who you're supposed to be. You need to appreciate everything in the now. You need to be so present in the now that you are inspired every day to be the most amazing person you can be, based on who you are right now.Craft a life based on who you are. For example: There are things I don't like to do. So I hire people to do them.Sure, it costs me money to do this. Sure I put less money in my pocket every single year. But you know what? I don't spend the time frustrated, angry, annoyed, or stressed out because I couldn't do something, because I had to do something that I did not like.I don't do anything in my life I do not like. My life is set up to be pure pleasure, and that's how life should be. We should be able to set our lives up exactly the way we want, because we only have one shot at this magical ride called life. One shot only. I love all the time when I sit down and I talk to a woman she'll say to me:""I really want a relationship, but I really don't think I'm going to have one until I get my business in order, get my life in order. Eventually that will happen, eventually I'll have a relationship.""No eventually that won't happen, because the magic moment of life is now. When you finally do get to wherever it eventually leads you to, there's going to be another eventually in your life, another series of things that you need to accomplish.When we all die, what's written on our tombstone is not the to-do list, not the series of ""eventually""s. People will remember you and how you touched their lives, how present you were when you were with them. It's time to become more present.

Experiencing an unprecedented orphan crisis, the nation's children depend on the innovation and support of their community.At goods for good, we currently focus our work in Malawi, where the needs of the people are great, but the entrepreneurial spirit is greater. Our mission is to build the financial capacity of African communities so that they can sustainably and independently care for their orphans. We do this through ""community enterprise,"" or small businesses that not only help finance orphan care programs, but also create jobs for adults and stimulate the local economy. We work hand in hand with our partners to strategically and thoughtfully launch each business in a sustainable and economically empowering manner.In Mchezi, Malawi -- a community supported by goods for good -- we recently launched a chicken farm enterprise. As a result of the infrastructure that we've built, the adults at Mchezi now have jobs and are running a successful poultry business, winning large contracts and selling chickens to local catering companies for a profit. But launching programs such as this takes time. Meanwhile, 50 percent of Malawian children drop out of school by the fourth grade because families and orphan care centers cannot afford the basic supplies required to enroll, including a uniform and shoes.That's where strategic partners like TOMS come in. goods for good has distributed new shoes to children in Malawi since 2011, integrating new shoes as part of its community enterprises and school uniform distributions.In Malawi, a child's future is almost entirely dependent on the opportunity to receive an education. According to UNESCO, every year of school can increase a child's future earnings by 10 percent. While primary and secondary school tuition is free, uniforms cost $3, and shoes are a requirement. In a country where the average income is $870 per year, this often prevents orphans from receiving an education. However, goods for good is able to distribute new shoes to orphan children to help eliminate the barriers to an education, and thus create an opportunity for a better future.We work with partners who are committed to integrating their support into comprehensive health and education programs. We've seen that shoes are critically important to children in developing nations, but that the context in which they are provided is equally as important. Shoes help young children walk many miles to school without contracting diseases or getting injured. One pair of black shoes can often be the difference between a child continuing his or her education and being forced to drop out.goods for good distributes shoes as part of an innovative education program for orphans, and then we take it a step further.As part of our community enterprise program, we train older, vulnerable orphans in tailoring. As a graduation requirement, they sew uniforms with donated fabric. These uniforms are given to orphaned children alongside new shoes. Not only can children go to school, but also their adult relatives, siblings and neighbors are gaining marketable skills and job opportunities.goods for good has seen school enrollment and attendance increase among its orphan care programs, and this finding can be common. In fact, a study shows that providing school uniforms, which can often include shoes, to children who cannot afford them can increase school attendance by up to 62 percent.This One Day Without Shoes -- the annual day TOMS encourages the world to go barefoot to bring global awareness to children's health and education -- we're taking off our shoes to commemorate the accomplishments of our partnership in Malawi. We hope you'll join us.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post and TOMS, in recognition of One Day Without Shoes, an annual day to bring global awareness to children's health and education by going without shoes.

This time 16 years ago, on April 14, 1997, DeGeneres unveiled her big secret on what has now become a famous cover of TIME magazine, plastered with the words ""Yep, I'm gay."" The funny lady didn't work for three years following her admission, and it took a few more for her to officially redeem her A-list stature in the public eye, which came largely thanks to her hilarious turn in ""Finding Nemo"" and the debut of her eponymous talk show. It wasn't easy being an out Hollywood star in the 1990s, and today we salute DeGeneres' bravery for enduring the intense backlash she saw for the span of several years.

France's upper house Senate voted today to approve a landmark bill granting homosexual couples the right to marry and adopt, after a heated debate and mass protests from conservatives and religious groups.

The French people strongly endorse same-sex marriage, and support for the right of married gay and lesbian couples to jointly adopt children sits just shy of 50 percent.France's Senate voted Friday to approve the landmark bill, but because it made minor changes to the adoption portion, the National Assembly must vote to approve the measure one more time before President François Hollande can sign it into law, which he has promised to do. Also on Friday, Hollande's Socialist Party announced that the final vote -- originally scheduled for May 20 -- would instead be held the following Wednesday, April 17, keeping marriage and adoption equality on track to become law in France by summer.But the push for equality has an ugly underbelly: hundreds of thousands of anti-equality protesters have marched through the streets of Paris, the nation's Catholic bishops have denounced the proposed law, and the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), a U.S.-based anti-gay organization, has taken a leading role in organizing the opposition, which consists mostly of Roman Catholics and conservatives. And as the marriage equality bill moves closer to passage, brutal and bloody attacks on LGBT people have surged: the head of a French anti-homophobia organization told Raw Story this week that reports of anti-gay assaults in the first two months of 2013 were up by 200 percent.When Hollande's government announced the fast-tracked final vote on Friday, several proponents of marriage discrimination responded with disturbing and violent threats. Frigide Barjot, leader of ""mainstream"" anti-equality group Manif pour tous, vowed, ""Hollande wants blood, and he will get it.""The threat marks a stark reversal from statements Barjot made just two days prior, when she claimed in the wake of a particularly savage anti-gay hate crime that her side ""[denounces] violence.""Christian Jacob, a deputy from the right-wing UMP party, echoed Barjot's inflammatory words, warning that by speeding up the bill's near-certain passage, Hollande ""is risking a violent confrontation with the French people."" Fellow UMP parliamentarian Hervé Mariton added that the move was ""an incitement to civil war.""France's gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community will find out in a matter of days whether these homophobes intend to make good on their chilling promises.I wonder, do the French Catholic bishops and NOM -- responsible for stirring up much of this anti-gay fervor -- endorse their allies' vulgar threats and violent attacks? If not, the clock is running out for both groups to issue a forceful and unequivocal condemnation.In the meantime, their silence speaks volumes.  Also published on my blog, johnmbecker.com."
