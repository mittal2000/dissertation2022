The Real Housewives of New York, if I'm going to be specific.",2013-05-28,"NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 04: (L-R) Cast members Ramona Singer and Sonja Morgan attend 'The Real Housewives Of New York City' Season 5 Premiere Viewing Party on June 4, 2012 in New York, United States. (Photo by Simon Russell/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2eb31f000051002182e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I'm having a serious problem with women hitting on my husband at wedding events, and I'm blaming it all on reality television. The Real Housewives of New York City, if I'm going to be specific. When those women travel together to exotic, tropical destinations, they behave like trash and they're setting a terrible example for the rest of the ladies out there watching. Want a real ""reality"" check? These women are not examples to be admired or followed -- they are exactly what your mother didn't want you to grow up to be. And yet, America is watching everything they do, and copying way too much of it.In March, there was a Mother of the Bride who wouldn't keep her paws off my husband at a wedding I planned here on Vieques Island. She was a bit of the desperate sort -- separated from the bride's father, but not yet divorced -- she was flying solo while her soon-to-be-ex had brought his new squeeze to their only daughter's wedding. So she tried to latch onto my husband at the welcome party and continued to behave like a tick through three days of events. I barely tolerated it out of respect for the bride, but also because I knew my husband Bill would put a stop to things if she got out of hand. It alternated between being annoying and amusing. She was at least 20 years older than me and I was embarrassed for her. The bride apologized repeatedly all weekend long. It was so obvious that nobody could ignore it.MoB finally crossed the line on the wedding night (you knew she was going to), after the reception and, fortunately, after her daughter had already departed the venue for the after-party. My husband called her on it and also stepped in to put a halt to her shenanigans when she jumped into the vehicle of another male wedding employee after my husband refused to let her into his truck. I was so glad the bride wasn't around to see her mother acting like this -- she would have been mortified. Believe me when I tell you the lady was a piece of work. But it got me thinking about why anybody would think it's okay to come down here and hit on my husband or any other employee in such a way. Who else behaves like this? This one wasn't even drunk.This isn't the first time I've questioned the inappropriate behavior of Caribbean destination wedding guests who act like college kids on spring break when they visit the islands. I've blogged about this topic before in the HuffPost (What I Never Expected to Happen to Me When I Was Running a Wedding) and it's something that we address with every bride and groom in our client guide, but yet sexual harassment of our employees and service staff continues to occur at an alarming rate. I keep asking myself what drives these wedding guests to act in such a way when they're at a destination wedding. What makes them think this behavior is okay on a tropical island? I think some of it can be blamed on celebrities setting bad examples.  Have you ever watched Sonja Morgan on The Real Housewives of New York City when she's sexually harassing male service staff, especially on vacation? That trip to St. Bart's was pretty damned revealing. Here are these poor island guys who are just trying to do their jobs and provide catering services to these rich women who have taken over a villa, and these old ladies are hitting on them -- aggressively, loudly, and obtrusively -- making it impossible for them to ignore the advances and still do their jobs. Then Ramona Singer gets in on it too, and because she has a hot husband, she seems to think she has a free pass to harass too. What's up with that? Nice role model for your daughters, ladies. How would Mario feel if his daughter were waitressing at a dinner and was treated by an older man the way his wife treats these young men? Just sayin'. And Sonja claims to be a party planner... really? REALLY? Maybe bachelor parties. As the entertainment.Dear God, please tell me that America's wedding guests haven't started using these ""celebrities"" as role models for how you are supposed to treat the hardworking people who make and serve your food on vacation. That could explain a lot about the way my wedding guests have been behaving. It's gotta be okay if the Housewives are openly doing it on national television, right? WRONG. I swear to God, this is the wedding equivalent of teenagers mimicking the antics on the show Jackass. There's a reason there is a warning on that show that says ""Don't try this at home."" Apparently, Bravo needs to consider labeling some of its shows ""Don't try this in public or any form of polite company.""I'm appalled by what I see shown on TV these days, and when the scenarios repeat themselves at my weddings, I never fail to recognize the parallel. I can't do any more than I have already to put a stop to it on the front end, but I think blogging about it and putting it out there is a good way to make a point. As a happily married woman who runs a wedding planning business, I may take this sort of inappropriate behavior more seriously that most people. You might be thinking that I don't have a sense of humor... but I do. At the very end of the night, when that same MoB who stalked my husband all weekend thanked me and told me the wedding was beautiful, I told her she should be very proud of herself for her poise and the manner in which she handled herself given the awkward situation. And I said it with a straight face. See... I do have a sense of humor.Until next time, happy wedding planning from Wedding in Vieques and Weddings in Culebra!Sandy"

Guest Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reinhart-rogoff-austerity_us_5bb2f623e4b0480ca65f9c30,The story of the Reinhart-Rogoff error tells us a great deal about how the elites use economists and the prestige of the economics profession in order to impose their will on the public.,2013-05-27,"The U.S. Capitol stands in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, April 9, 2013. Less than a week after job-creation figures fell short of expectations and underscored the U.S. economy's fragility, President Barack Obama will send Congress a budget that doesn't include the stimulus his allies say is needed and instead embraces cuts in an appeal to Republicans. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2f623260000e90081fd75.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At this point everyone who follows economic policy debates knows about the famous Reinhart-Rogoff spreadsheet error uncovered by a University of Massachusetts graduate student. When the error is corrected, there is nothing resembling the growth falloff cliff associated with a 90 percent debt-to-GDP ratio that had been the main takeaway from the initial paper.There has been an interesting response from the mainstream of the profession. On the one hand, they have been quick to rebuke those on their political left for making a big deal out of a silly mistake (here, here and here). They have also assured everyone that it really doesn't matter anyhow since no one actually used the Reinhart-Rogoff work as a basis for policy. Both points raise interesting issues.Of course the fact that two well-known Harvard economics professors made a silly spreadsheet error should not be a big deal. However the beauty of a spreadsheet error is that it is something that everyone can understand.We all know what it means to enter the wrong number or add the wrong columns. That doesn't require advanced training in economics.The silly spreadsheet error was important in the debt debate controversy because it allowed for a real debate. Ordinarily Harvard economists don't engage their less credentialed colleagues at places like the University of Massachusetts. (Hey, they never even responded to my emails requesting their data.)Unfortunately, even the best reporters at the most prestigious news outlets rarely feel sufficiently knowledgeable to challenge pronouncements from prominent economists. This means that the profession must rely on internal policing to weed out bad arguments. The Reinhart-Rogoff 90 percent cliff was widely accepted policy wisdom for more than three years, which suggests the internal policing in the economics profession is pretty damn weak.Of course the more fundamental point that came up in the wake of Excelgate is that Reinhart-Rogoff show nothing about causation. Efforts to examine the direction of causation show that it goes almost entirely from slow growth to high debt (here and here) not from debt to slow growth as is generally implied in the policy debate.And, those who ever learned accounting would recall that debt is only half of a balance sheet. We would have to consider assets also if we really wanted to tell a story about how debt could impact growth.These points were made to a large swath of the public not because of the internal policing of the economics profession, but because of an Excel spreadsheet error. For this reason, those who care about honest academic and policy debates should be celebrating the spreadsheet error. If this embarrasses important people in the economics profession, that's because it is a profession that deserves to be embarrassed.The other side of the argument from the mainstream of the profession, that Reinhart-Rogoff was not actually the basis for policy, also deserves ridicule. The essence of their case is that those pushing austerity would have done so whether or not they had the Reinhart-Rogoff studies. In other words, politicians wanted to push cuts in government spending because they wanted to push cuts in government spending, not because Reinhart-Rogoff's paper convinced them that these cuts were necessary to support growth.The fact that politicians respond to political pressures, not academic arguments is undoubtedly true. That is how politicians get elected.This is why everyone's bull***t detectors should be blasting off the charts every time they see a story about how a politician is acting based on their political philosophy or ideology. Politicians are acting based on the demands of their political supporters. They don't get elected based on their beautiful political philosophies.When the mainstream economists tell us that the pushers of austerity would have done so even without Reinhart-Rogoff, this is not news. However, the Reinhart-Rogoff story was hugely important in selling the austerity case to the larger public. It is much easier for politicians to say that we have to cut Social Security for widows and Head Start for children in order to avoid two decades of stagnation, than for them to say that these cuts are necessary in order to ensure that their campaign contributors don't have to pay more in taxes.And the Reinhart-Rogoff story was used with great success towards this end. In fact, the 90 percent debt-to-GDP threshold became a fixture in the Washington budget debate after it was included in the report by the co-chairs of President Obama's deficit commission, former Senator Alan Simpson and Morgan Stanley Director Erskine Bowles.In short, the story of the Reinhart-Rogoff error tells us a great deal about how the elites use economists and the prestige of the economics profession in order to impose their will on the public. The internal policing of the profession is essentially non-existent and even the best reporters do not feel competent to challenge the claims of top economists.That is not a pretty picture of the state of economic policy debates, but the first step toward making it better is recognizing where things stand now."

We have changed the world and we are going to continue to change it,"" said Margaret O'Mara, associate professor of history at the University of Washington, who has written about the building of Silicon Valley.""It's also a reflection of robust bank accounts. They have a lot of cash.""Historically, however, when a company becomes preoccupied with the grandeur of its premises, it often signals a high point in its fortunes. These fantastical buildings may end up as little more than costly monuments to vanity and a loss of focus on the core business that made for success in the first place.""I've been thinking the Apple spaceship is going to get nicknamed the 'Death Star' because the project is so big and the timing is so bad,"" said hedge fund manager Jeff Matthews of Ram Partners. The building is coming to fruition just as Apple's product cycles may be maturing, he explained. ""It is such a classic contrary indicator that you just get the shakes."" He no longer holds Apple stock.Walter Price, who runs technology investment funds at RCM Capital Management LLC, shares the outlook: ""When companies build big headquarters it's usually when they're doing really well and have strong outlooks, and that often coincides with a peak in their stock."" Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are battling to recruit tech talent, and attractive campuses help with that, he added, but Apple's plan has not gone down well with investors. RCM's tech funds no longer hold shares.PROJECT RUNAWAYAmazon's design, presented to Seattle city planners this week, includes three steel and glass spheres almost 100 feet high, which will serve as the centerpiece for three new skyscrapers that will house a rapidly growing workforce in downtown Seattle.The plans call for ""a series of intersecting spheres with ample space for a wide range of planting material, as well as individuals working alone or in groups."" Amazon declined further comment.Google Inc, the world's largest Internet search company, has outgrown its original headquarters in Silicon Valley's Mountain View and is planning to build a 1.1 million square foot Googleplex nearby.Called Bay View, it will have nine rectangular buildings, horizontally bent, with living roofs surrounded by courtyards and connected by bridges. No employee will be more than a two-and-a-half-minute walk away from any colleague, a design aimed at encouraging collaboration. A Google spokeswoman declined further comment.Facebook Inc is taking the collaborative idea a step further, with plans for Facebook West, an addition to its main campus in Menlo Park, California, that will be the size of seven-and-a-half football fields.Facebook hired Gehry to bring his trademark style of unexpected angles and understated drama to what is essentially one enormous open-plan office, where a worker can wander from one end to the other without ever going through a door. The rooftop serves as a park.An earlier version of the building plan featured flares on the ends of the structure like butterfly wings, but Facebook decided not to go ahead with them, said Rachel Grossman, associate planner for the city of Menlo Park.Facebook spokesman Tucker Bounds said the expansion will be ""extremely cost-effective"" and is needed to help the company develop new products for its users. He declined to comment further.Apple has the most ambitious idea, a 2.8 million square foot glass ring on 176 acres. It would be in part a monument to former Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who described it as like a spaceship and was closely involved in the plans before he died in 2011.The project, which could cost up to $5 billion according to reports, would house about 12,000 Apple employees. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.TEMPTING FATEThe technology sector has amassed large cash piles in recent years, leaving many companies over-capitalized, said Bill Smead, head of Smead Capital Management, which oversees $465 million in assets and does not own shares of Apple, Amazon, Facebook or Google. ""Over-capitalized companies often don't perform well, and leaders of over-capitalized companies sometimes squander the money,"" he said.Apple, Amazon and Facebook are not getting tax breaks or other similar financial incentives for their plans, according to local officials. It is not clear if Google is receiving any incentives.While these plans radiate optimism, they risk bringing down a curse that has befallen big companies just as they construct pyramid-scale palaces.AOL-Time Warner started building the Time Warner Center, a 2.8 million square foot structure on the edge of New York's Central Park featuring two towering glass skyscrapers, right as the tech stock bubble popped in 2000, destroying more than three-quarters of the Internet and media company's value.The New York Times Co, Wall Street bank Bear Stearns and chemical company Union Carbide also built ambitious headquarters just before their businesses hit tough times.The ""campus curse"" has claimed several tech victims as well.In the early 1990s, Borland Software - once the second-largest independent software company - spent more than $100 million on offices just south of Silicon Valley that featured ponds, tennis courts and a swimming pool. By 2008 the company had been hammered in the market by Microsoft and was worth less than the cost of the complex.Since then, Yahoo Inc, MySpace, Inktomi, Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics have either hatched plans for or moved into swaggering headquarters, only to hit the skids. Google moved into Silicon Graphics' campus and Facebook took over Sun's headquarters.Salesforce.com Inc got the shakes in time. In late 2011 the stock had fallen from a July high, and analysts were criticizing the company for excessive spending on sales and marketing. Earlier approved plans to build a $2 billion high-tech campus in San Francisco were canceled by the following February.PRODUCTIVITY PREMIUM?Despite these cautionary tales, some say the new breed of tech companies are smart to construct their own buildings, which match the collaborative way they work and can yield long-term productivity and energy-efficiency benefits.""As they see energy prices going up they recognize that these buildings have to last longer, and they need to be more in control of the operation costs of these buildings. A property developer does not focus on such long-term things,"" said John Barton, director of the architectural design program at Stanford University.""Employees are more productive in the right kinds of environments. That may be more expensive, but if it pays back in a 5 percent productivity increase, that may be really smart,"" he added.O'Mara at University of Washington suggests the new tech giants are emulating the workplace innovations of the famous Bell Labs, the historic research arm of AT&T that gave birth to the transistor, the laser and technology behind mobile phones over many decades.Bell's legendary facility, designed by modernist architect Eero Saarinen in the late 1950s, might not be the right role monument.Now owned by global telecom giant Alcatel Lucent, the quarter-mile-long mirrored box lies empty, and is likely to end up being turned into a medical center - or razed.(Additional reporting by Poornima Gupta.

Your second track, ""In Your Eyes,"" is already at #12 on the singles chart. ""Counting white lines for 1,000 nights"" I'm guessing references touring. Where is the road taking you next?Thanks. The song has done pretty well to start off. The road is taking me to some familiar places. I'm off to tour Scotland in a couple weeks and also have a final show planned in London to close out the tour. It's been a few years since I made it home so I'm rather excited.Your followers on social media are a mighty crew. What's it like for a guy from Scotland living in New Orleans to have a legion of dedicated McHobbit fans on Twitter?It's a strange and humbling thing to have such a following of people trying to get your music out there. I've taken a rather winding path to be where I am, with record labels, Hollywood and years of making music in the U.S. so it just adds another element of surreal to an already interesting yellow brick road. The passion of the McHobbits is something I'm very grateful for (sounds like a good movie title too). They work very hard to make sure the world is listening.With a Number One single out of the gates, it seems to be working. What advice would you give musicians from Bourbon to Beale Street about navigating the music industry, where everything constantly changing seems to be the norm?Bourbon Street was a great learning curve for me but I see musicians get lost in it. Not literally ... 'cause it's not that big. But metaphorically speaking, they lose their appetite to make their own music and maybe let the job kill the hunger a bit. My advice would be to not lose focus. Music should make you passionate, not take it away.Good Advice. Now to The Voice, not to make you pick favorites, but who are your favorites in this season?Without picking any favorites, I think my favorites are team Blake [Shelton] (shocker!). The Swon Brothers are great and have got my backing and Danielle Bradberry has no right being that good at that age. I couldn't sing anywhere near that when I was 16. She's killer. Like a baby faced sonic assassin.After dropping the perfect band name, Baby Faced Sonic Assassin, Terry McDermott's on to his next single and a European tour.

(Photo by Foto24/Gallo Images/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1ab7a3c000018010be3c5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ten years ago today, the United States Congress, in a remarkable display of compassion and bipartisanship, passed overwhelmingly legislation that established an historic and transforming global health program now known as PEPFAR -- the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. At the time that PEPFAR was conceived of and then established during the George W. Bush administration, the world was witnessing first-hand the destruction of an entire generation of individuals in the prime years of their lives and the reversal of remarkable health and development gains, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and to a lesser extent in other developing nations. Rates of new HIV infections were rising rapidly, and hospitals, communities, and families were often too under-resourced and overwhelmed to cope with the enormity of this burden. At that time in 2003, despite the availability of life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in most countries in the developed world, in southern Africa and other regions of the developing world, an HIV diagnosis meant a virtual death sentence, since few had access to such drugs. Today, as we mark the 10th anniversary of PEPFAR, the situation has changed dramatically. Plummeting life expectancy rates in much of Africa have been reversed; HIV-infected, but healthy, fathers and mothers who are receiving therapy are able to return to work, care for their families, and spur economic development. Doctors, nurses, and community health workers, who once had little to offer their patients beyond a more dignified death, are delivering life-saving ART to millions of people. AIDS-related mortality has declined by more than 26 percent since its peak in 2005. Where despair once cut a devastating swath through so many communities and countries, hope has been renewed. With regard to the prevention of HIV infection, globally, in the decade since PEPFAR began, new HIV infections have declined by nearly 19 percent. Between 2009 and 2011, new HIV infections among children, still an important component of the epidemic in many southern African countries and other regions in the developing world, declined by 24 percent globally, compared to a 23 percent decline in the previous six years. Not only is progress happening, but its pace is accelerating. According to a recent report evaluating PEPFAR by the Institute of Medicine, ""PEPFAR has played a transformative role with its contribution to the global response to HIV."" As of the end of September 2012, PEPFAR was directly supporting 5.1 million people on ART -- a more than three-fold increase in just the past four years. Last year alone, PEPFAR reached more than 750,000 pregnant women living with HIV with antiretroviral drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), allowing an estimated 230,000 babies who would have otherwise been infected to be born without HIV. One key driver of this progress is the development and implementation of a combination prevention program. Just as it became clear that multiple HIV medicines, when used in concert, more effectively control replication of the virus in the body, it was shown that multiple prevention interventions, when implemented together, can more effectively reduce new HIV infections at the population level. This evolution in our thinking and approach to preventing HIV infection has reflected scientific innovation together with practical implementation. Landmark scientific advances, coupled with lessons learned from a decade of implementing programs under PEPFAR, have given us the tools, knowledge, and experience needed to achieve an AIDS-free generation.Recent statistics show that the promise of an AIDS-free generation is truly within our reach, as President Obama powerfully articulated in his State of the Union address earlier this year. More countries than ever before have reached, or surpassed, the programmatic tipping points in their HIV epidemics -- the point at which the annual increase in adult patients receiving treatment exceeds the number of annual new adult HIV infections. Reaching this tipping point is a key indication that a country is on the path to achieving an AIDS-free generation -- and the more countries that achieve this goal, the closer we will be to ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic. While PEPFAR is certainly the largest and most successful foreign health assistance program in history, it is clear that the United States cannot be alone in this endeavor... Other partners, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to which the U.S. is the largest contributor, multilateral organizations, the private sector, civil society, and host countries must all share in the responsibility. And, as PEPFAR enters its second decade, countries with a high burden of HIV disease must assume greater ownership for addressing the health needs of their own people by building strong and sustainable health systems.PEPFAR represents the very best of America -- the extraordinary generosity and compassion of the American people. Through PEPFAR, we are helping to deliver a better future to millions around the globe. Although much remains to be done in the future, the 10th anniversary of PEPFAR is something to celebrate now. Ambassador Eric Goosby is the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and head of the State Department's Office of Global Health Diplomacy.

It's the greatest job I could ever have imagined (besides pitching for the LA Dodgers). I'm constantly reminded of how creative, curious, complex, dedicated and compelling human beings can be.Inspiring individuals live all over the place. I meet them in line at Brooklyn Water Bagel, and everywhere I travel. They do so much good for others, and most do so without a microphone or television camera present to capture their impact. I've met plenty of these under-sung stars through the organization that I started 25 years ago, the Larry King Cardiac Foundation. The original goal was to help those without medical insurance secure the cardiac care needed to stay alive. We've worked with countless everyday heroes -- from doctors and researchers to family members and the heart patients themselves.Now, in this era of major healthcare changes, challenges and opportunities, my wife Shawn and I are opening a new phase in evolution of our foundation. With the help of a new president Tamsin Smith, we are committed to making prevention and heart health a more visible, accessible, and fun priority for all. We know we don't need to reinvent the wheel here. What we can perhaps uniquely do, however, is make the ""how"" and the ""who"" behind greater heart health much more famous. Think of the healthy heart as the next big celebrity. I'd love to see one grace the cover of Time magazine.So, time to get to work. We'll do our part to put the everyday heroes of heart health in front of the country's inquiring minds. We'll use the media as a megaphone to up the importance of exercise, better nutrition and minimizing stress -- and we'll celebrate the organizations and individuals who are making a huge difference neighbor by neighbor, heart by heart.I love sharing stories. Certainly Carlos Slim, Quincy Jones and 50 Cent have lots to say on plenty of topics, including how to live a vital life. Certainly, the more I live life, the more I've come to understand that people are more alike than different, and everyone has a story to tell. I'm excited about expanding the circle, and sharing more stories -- through multiple channels -- on who the doers are in making the rest us fans of heart health.Here's just one such story to whet your appetite:Nick Papandoopoulos runs a family farm in Sonoma County called Bloomfield. It's a great spot to go and pick organic vegetables with your kids. But on his small farm, as on most, there's sometimes a surplus of produce. It frustrated him that those leafy greens would go to waste without a kitchen table to go home to. He also knew there were plenty of hunger-relief organizations that could benefit, if he could just figure out a way to transform potential waste into much-needed nutrition. Well, he's figured out a super smart way to make those connections and engage the whole community in the process. Check out CropMobster.Do you know any folks like Nick out there? We want to talk up people who are helping make our country healthier and happier with smart new projects like CropMobster? If you do, please do me a favor and post a link on our foundation's Facebook wall. From where I sit, I bet they have some pretty incredible stories to tell and we're hungry to share them."
