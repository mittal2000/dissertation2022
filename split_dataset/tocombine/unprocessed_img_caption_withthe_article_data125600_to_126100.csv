They say it's one of the largest North American feathered dinosaurs. Our friends at HuffPost Science report: ""Researchers ... determined that A. wyliei likely sported a crest and feathery forelimbs. It also had a long neck, a short, thick tail, and killer claws. The dinosaur was more than 11 feet long and weighed around 440 to 660 pounds."" In other words, it looked like a gigantic chicken.Questions for discussion:In her cookbook, The Family Dinner, Laurie David talks about the importance of families making a ritual of sitting down to dinner together, and how family dinners offer a great opportunity for meaningful discussions about the day's news. ""Dinner,"" she says, ""is as much about digestible conversation as it is about delicious food.""We couldn't agree more. So HuffPost has joined with Laurie and every Friday afternoon, just in time for dinner, our editors highlight one of the most compelling news stories of the week -- stories that will spark a lively discussion among the whole family."

Prague isn't the only city to set limits on love locks: authorities in Paris have discussed removing locks from the Pont des Arts bridge in light of safety concerns, and locks were taken off the Ponte Milvio in Rome after citizens complained they were a form of ""vandalism.""But whether they're welcome or not, we've gotta say love padlocks are some of the most endearing things you'll see on your travels.

2,FOOD & DRINK,Grass Fed vs. Regular Beef: Which Tastes Better?,Julie R. Thomson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grass-fed-beef-burger_us_5b9df01ae4b03a1dcc8f1eef,We take our burgers very seriously.,2014-03-21,"UNITED STATES - APRIL 05: The burger at Chef Marc Meyer's Cookshop is made of organic, grass-fed beef and topped with greenmarket greens, Vermont cheddar and strips of Berkshire bacon. (Photo by Malu Alvarez/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df01a2200005600d9d258.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We take our burgers very seriously here at HuffPost Taste. We know how good they can be when made right, so we don't want to settle for anything less. With burger season (almost) in foreseeable sight, we got to thinking: with all the hype of grass-fed burgers, does it really make a difference when it comes to taste? And is it really worth the steep price tag? We know that there are die-hard fans for both types of beef. Some burger connoisseurs swear by their ""regular beef"" burgers and other burger eaters promise that grass-fed has better results. (For this particular purpose, it's all about taste -- ethics are not coming into play.) To get to the meat of the matter, we conducted a blind taste test comparing a burger made with standard-issue, grain-fed supermarket beef vs. one made with grass-fed beef (from Moveable Beast Farm) -- both of them 85-percent lean. Our group of burger-loving editors tasted them plain, served on a Martin's potato bun. No cheese, no bacon, no frills. Just burger.Before we began the taste test, we worried that people wouldn't be able to taste the difference between regular and grass-fed beef. ""How different could they be?"" we wondered. We were SO wrong. Every single editor was able to taste which burger was made with grass-fed beef, and they were almost 100 percent unanimous (see the side note below) as to which one made the better burger. We learned first hand that the price tag is worth it, people. Grass-fed beef makes for a significantly better tasting burger. Here's what the editors had to say about each:Small farm, grass-fed beef: ""Meat town! Great flavor."" ""This one has a definite earthy/grassy flavor."" ""Juicier, more flavorful."" ""Tender, juicy, more like stewed meat."" ""This is GOOD.""Standard-issue, grain-fed supermarket beef:""Very little flavor involved. Not a meat-man's meat."" ""Meat was a bit indistinguishable."" ""Tasted good, but it was sort of generic tasting."" ""Typical old-school burger flavor and texture."" ""Good, solid burger, but totally forgettable.""SIDE NOTE: This is what the one person who preferred the regular burger over the grass-fed burger had to say about the regular burger: ""Tastes juicy, succulent. It's a warm sumer day sitting by the pool in my mouth. A fine-lookin' girl in a bathing suit brings me this burger and then we dance all night eating chemically-fed dead cow."" And the same editor's thoughts on the grass-fed burger: "" Grass fed. Tastes weird. F*ck grass."" So clearly, that taster is crazy.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

An infographic released recently by Rasmussen College, a for-profit institution with campuses around the country, shows exactly why families need to have more access to high-quality preschool options. The infographic spells out the positive chain of events that occurs when more kids go to preschool: More education tends to lead to more high school graduates; and when the high school graduation rate is improved by just 1 percent, there are thousands of fewer assaults, burglaries and thefts each year, according to Rasmussen's data.Yet, as the infographic also shows, the percentage of 4-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education programs has barely budged over the past few years. While some state governors have started doing their part to improve enrollment rates, a federal bill written last year by several congressmen looking to expand preschool enrollment has gone nowhere.Take a look at the infographic below: Infographic by Column Five for Rasmussen College."

6,PARENTING,The Bittersweet Milestone I Didn't See Coming,"Devon Corneal, Contributor
Mother, writer, lawyer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-bittersweet-milestone-i-didnt-see-coming_us_5b9deb82e4b03a1dcc8ec24c,"Reading is one of those things that make sense to me as a mother, something that came easily and defines the contours of my days.",2014-03-20,"<em>Bedtime Math 2: This Time, It's Personal</em> by Laura Overdeck",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9deb7d2200008300d9d06f.png?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"My addiction started early. What began as an innocent desire to escape into fantasy and find some calm in the midst of chaos turned into a lifelong habit. I ran with crowds that accepted my behavior, only cutting back when I got my first real job and realized my extracurricular activities would have to take a backseat if I hoped to stay employed. My husband knew all about my history and even loved me for it. When I had my son, though, it all came rushing back. In the anxious, ""Oh dear God, what happens if I drop him"" first days of my son's life, I needed something to keep me occupied and take the edge off the sleep deprivation. I couldn't stop the cravings. I started reading again. In the beginning, there wasn't much else I could do while trapped in a blue puffy rocker with a voracious 10-pound newborn attached to my breasts. Before I figured out that I didn't need both hands to hold him, I asked my husband to read to us. Picking from a shelf filled with carefully chosen childhood classics, we started with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but quickly switched to James and the Giant Peach, because for reasons I cannot explain, an orphan boy living with giant insects flying over the ocean in an enormous piece of fruit seemed less terrifying than an orphan boy going to magic school and learning how to fly a broom. I would close my eyes and listen, soothed by the rhythm of the chair, as my husband's voice filled the space between baby cries and cooing. Once I learned to juggle a book and a baby at the same time, there was no going back. I had rediscovered the magic and joy of getting lost in a good book. I was hooked, and despite his focus on sleeping and spitting up, I was convinced Little Dude was too. I had a partner in literary crime. Brightly colored board books lured us further into the dangerous world of reading. Although they're designed to withstand the brutality of infant hands, I discovered that even board books could be ruined if you dropped them in the bathtub or chewed on them with newly acquired baby teeth. They are also strain-your-shoulder-wrench-out-your-back kind of heavy if you insist on taking 15 of them on a trip to the park. I identified the magical properties of clear packing tape as I honed my book repair skills. Books are not discarded in our house; they are mended and tended and allowed to retire to the memory trunk in the attic. I perfected my sing-song voice. Soon, however, board books were not enough. We needed more. Picture books gave us the high we were looking for, filled with more complicated stories and the occasional inside joke. When I say books, I am using the plural intentionally. I am incapable of restraint. During his toddler years, Little Dude picked out four or five books a night and I read each of them faithfully. We borrowed armloads from the library, made regular runs to the bookstore and gratefully took in refugees from our neighbors. I bought bigger and bigger bookshelves (thank you IKEA) and filled them. I stole space in the basement, living room, TV room and kitchen, and made piles on the floor. We are never more than arm's reach from a book, so we never have to wait for our fix. These days we're carefully adding in chapter books. This is the good stuff. We're talking Breaking Bad-quality storytelling, so I'm going slowly. I read until I am hoarse, visiting with pirates, monsters, fairies, lost boys, animals of all shapes and sizes, knights and dragons, mischievous boys and girls, planes, trains, automobiles, construction trucks, sinking ships and talking vegetables. I read when I am sick, or tired, or overworked. This isn't to say that on occasion I haven't wanted to poke my eyes out when my son picks the same book five nights in a row, but those times are few and far between. My husband loves to read to Little Dude too, but I rarely surrender my spot on the bed, snuggled up to a boy who smells vaguely of peanut butter and shampoo. Reading is one of those things that make sense to me as a mother, something that came easily and defines the contours of my days. It's also nearing an end. Three nights ago, Little Dude asked if we could read in the ""big bed,"" which is code for ""maybe I can trick her into letting me sleep in here instead of my own room tonight."" Because he is cute and his dad is traveling on business and I am weak, I said yes. He hauled in a stack of books, hoping that I'd agree to read them in addition to our nightly chapter of Harry Potter. (We've finally reached the point where his curiosity about what happens to the Boy Who Lived outweighs his fear of three-headed dogs and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. This is my Holy Grail.) I told him to look through his books while I got ready for bed. I took off my necklace, brushed my teeth and started rummaging for a pair of pajamas when I realized that Little Dude wasn't just looking through his books. He was reading one of them. Out loud. Using real words. In order. He was halfway through Green Eggs and Ham before it hit me that he was reading the bedtime story. I climbed quietly on the bed to listen. Sixty-two pages and one teary mom later, he was done. Just like that, everything changed. I have loved Dr. Seuss for as long as I can remember, but none of his stories has ever made me cry. Not even The Lorax, and if the hungry Brown Bar-ba-loots don't get you, nothing will. I'm proud and pleased that we've raised a boy who loves books as much as we do. But his independence means I'm no longer the gatekeeper to the worlds found between the covers of a book -- he has his own way in. For someone like me, who has spent her life spellbound by good stories and savoring words, this is no small thing. My son is doing that pesky thing that kids do: he's growing up. Although I know he's not going to abandon our bedtime routine tomorrow -- Harry has six more years at Hogwarts and I think we'll see them through together -- I am on borrowed time. I have to prepare myself for the day when I'm relegated to making snacks and stocking the bookshelves and helping him with the really long words as he prepares to travel to Narnia and Middle Earth and Olympus without me. I only hope he enjoys the journey as much as I did.Also on HuffPost:"
7,WELLNESS,Too Much Negative and Positive Emotion Can Damage the Heart,"Dr. Cynthia Thaik, Contributor
Cardiologist, Author, Founder Of Revitalize-U",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/too-much-negative-and-positive-emotion-can-damage-the-heart_us_5b9def06e4b03a1dcc8f0a3d,"Emotions can have a huge effect on our physical health. For optimal heart health and well-being, it is important to learn how to manage and balance our emotions, both negative and positive.",2014-03-20,"Digital composite showing human heart and skeleton, in a man's body.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9def062100003300c5b75d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Simply put, emotions are part of what makes us human. They dictate how we feel and guide our behavior and actions. They can motivate us to compete, to fight or flee, to change or create, and even to help others. Moreover, emotions can also have a huge effect on our physical health. For optimal heart health and well-being, it is important to learn how to manage and balance our emotions, both negative and positive.We all know that negative emotions can take their toll on our mind and spirit, but studies show that negative emotions can also suppress the immune system, increase stress levels, cause the heart to beat faster and blood pressure to rise, and even change the heart's electrical stability, all of which can lead to heart disease and stroke.So it would seem that the answer is easy. Simply train yourself to get rid of those negative emotions, and be happier and more positive, and the problem is solved, right? Well, it's not actually that simple. Jane Gruber of the Department of Psychology at Yale University believes that too much happiness may also be bad for us.Based on her research, Gruber believes that high levels of positive feelings can cause an invincibility complex that leads to high-risk behaviors like excessive alcohol consumption and binge eating. According to her, these elevated levels of positivity could also cause us to ignore threats to our health and well-being and even become complacent when it comes to challenges and change.As a cardiologist with Eastern roots, I am also aware that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) supports the idea that there is a direct relationship between emotions and physical health. The concept of qi, or vital energy, dictates that emotions are closely integrated with the organs. The heart is the source of all emotions and holds the essential spirit, so if the emotions are out of balance, the physical heart must be too.Many TCM practitioners believe that normal emotional activity causes no disease or weakness, but when emotions cause excessive mental stimulation or become too powerful, they disturb the qi. This causes serious injury to the internal organs and leaves the body susceptible to disease. Just like negative emotions can wreak havoc on stress levels and heart health, an emotional excess of joy can also ""scatter the spirit.""That being said, both negative and positive emotions do have a purpose. Negative emotions allow us to adapt to new situations, meet challenges, and recognize threats, while positive emotions inspire us and heal the body. How, then, do we find the balance between too much or too little emotion? The first step is being aware of your emotions. Once you recognize how your emotions are affecting you, you can counterbalance the good with the bad to find an equilibrium. This does not mean suppressing negative feelings and replacing them with positive emotions. Rather, it means accepting what you are feeling at that moment and approaching your emotions from a calm and peaceful place to find a balance that works for you.When it comes to matters of the heart, emotions are key. Both negative and positive emotions are important to a grounded perspective that is emotionally healthy and well-balanced. Rather than simply seeking happiness, we should seek to learn how to create harmony between emotions, soul, spirit and body. If we are connected with our inner emotional selves, we will be able to manage any circumstances that come our way in a manner that will not destroy or severely damage our health and our hearts.For more information about balancing your body, mind and spirit and healthy living, please read my comprehensive book on heart health, Your Vibrant Heart: Restoring Health, Strength and Spirit From the Body's Core. The book includes many more insights about how to nurture and care for your heart on both a physical and emotional level. For more on Dr. Cynthia Thaik, visit drcynthia.com.

8,FOOD & DRINK,Bizarre But Delicious Filipino Dishes That Parents Have To Trick Their Kids Into Eating,Tiara Chiaramonte,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bizarre-but-delicious-filipino-dishes_us_5b9def76e4b03a1dcc8f1218,A look at some of the weird but delectable foods of the Philippines,2014-03-20,"A balut or balot is a developing duck embryo that is boiled and eaten in the shell. It is commonly sold as street food in the Philippines. They are common food in countries in Southeast Asia, such as Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. It was too dark and my hands were trembling, so I could not take a proper pic. This pic, taken from Wikipaedia, shows how the balut looks when peeled. (Davao, Philippines, May 2013)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9def7626000036008010a7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Filipino cuisine is shrouded in mystery for most Americans, except for some of the most extreme dishes like balut, a developing duck embryo that’s cooked alive, or durian, a fruit that literally smells like trash. Since I'm only half-Filipino, my family had to trick me into eating the exotic traditional dishes that always turned out to be delicious. So here’s a guide to some dishes that might have intimidating appearances, but are actually tasty. Dinuguan  Every Filipino you meet will have a story about this ominously brown soup. Parents sadistically tell their kids dinuguan is chocolate soup but in reality it’s made of pig's intestines, kidneys, lungs, heart and snout cooked in blood. Now this may make you cringe, but honestly it's not terrible. The taste is similar to blood sausage or British black pudding. Lugaw My grandmother was very resourceful and always bought whole chickens and butchered them instead of buying precut meats. Coincidentally every time after my grandfather made lugaw. Lugaw is rice porridge with ginger, garlic, chicken stock and chicken – or so I thought. Much later in life after my grandfather’s death, I noticed my grandmother didn’t make lugaw when she bought chicken. It turned out she didn’t know how to treat the chicken innards like my grandfather did. Sisig  Growing up I never questioned that sisig was anything other then delicious fried pork bits. Well it's fried to cover up the texture of pig's face and liver. Since it's marinated in lemon juice and vinegar the gamey flavor is covered up. Crab SotanghonThis single dish scarred me from eating shellfish for a good portion of my life. The soup itself is a pretty standard Asian cellophane noodle soup with chicken or seafood broth. So what could possibly be so bad about crab? Well my grandparents ate the head of the crab, which to my complete shock looks nothing like the leg meat. It's a light green soupy mess and if you're lucky the crab might have bright orange eggs inside of it. Balut  To be honest I’ve never had the most infamous Filipino dish, balut. Or at least I think I haven't. When I was ten-years-old I watched in horror as my grandfather fed my baby cousin balut saying it was a hard-boiled egg. The poor toddler had no idea what she had gotten herself into and wanted a second egg. I worry if I was once that gullible too and perhaps enjoyed balut before I knew what it was. Bulalo  This is a clear broth made by cooking down the collagen of beef shanks and bone marrow. Served with bok choy and corn it tastes similar to the Vietnamese soup pho. But the highlight of the dish is the giant bones filled with marrow. As a kid I was told the marrow was no different from beef and to slurp it out of the bone but my eyes and taste buds certainly begged to differ. Crispy Pata  Yet another well disguised pork dish. This fried, salty, goodness of pork is actually made from the pig's knuckles. A fact that I didn’t even know until I started writing this story and called my family for recipes. But don't let the region of the pig this dish originates from scare. Crispy pata not only my favorite Filipino dish, but my favorite preparation of pork.
