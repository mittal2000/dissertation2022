When I first moved to Los Angeles 27 years ago to make my mark, Joan was the very first comic that I ever saw do stand-up. She was performing at Carlos and Charlie's. I was working for Tom Bradley, the late, great mayor of this city and because of the mayor I met the owners of that iconic club. I used to go up to the lounge there to watch, learn, and laugh. So getting the opportunity to talk to her -- represented a full-circle moment for me. Over two nights, our conversation covered many things -- her devotion to her family, her legendary work ethic, her delight in making people laugh -- and then it took on what turned out to be a prescient dimension. I asked her how she would know when the time had come to stop performing. Here's her answer:*TRANSCRIPT*Rivers: I will know when I guess I do the same joke three times, I will know. And then I will go offstage and call Dr. Kevorkian. And you're waiting for a joke. There's no joke.Tavis: No, no, I didn't laugh. I was just about to say I think you meant that.Rivers: Oh, true.Tavis: That if you couldn't be onstage, you wouldn't want to be here.Rivers: Done. I have it in my will or whatever you call it, and the lawyer got crazy. Do not resuscitate if I cannot get up and be able to do 90 minutes onstage in concert. That's it. And my lawyer argued with me about how long [laugh].Tavis: You wanted 90 minutes.Rivers: He said, ""What about 60?"" I said, ""90 minutes, Michael.""Tavis: If I can't do 90, don't even resuscitate me.Rivers: Do not resuscitate. 90 minutes onstage. He's arguing ""How about 60? We'll get a really good opening act."" [Laugh] He's arguing. My life is crazy.Tavis: I didn't laugh when you said that because I...Rivers: Absolutely true.Tavis: I saw in your eyes that you meant that.Rivers: Oh, totally.Tavis: If I can't do what I do, I don't even want to be around here.Rivers: Don't want to sit down and be a vegetable. I don't want Melissa seeing her mother sitting there singing World War I songs, ""Over there, over there..."" [Laugh] ""Change her catheter."" I don't want any of this, uh-uh, mm-mm. Hello, Amsterdam, I'm outta here [laugh].I've had a great life. If I drop dead right now, nobody's gonna say, ""So young."" [Laugh]. I've had such a great ride, such a great ride. I'm just so lucky, so lucky."

But in the wake of Joan Rivers' death, an interview has resurfaced in which she praises the genius of Robin Williams. Rivers died Thursday, Sept. 4, at the age of 81 following complications from a procedure on her vocal cords. After Rivers' daughter, Melissa, announced the tragic news, outlets around the world reminisced about the mark she left behind. Playboy unearthed a 1986 interview with Rivers, during which she discussed her iconic role on ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,"" her penchant for plastic surgery and the institution of marriage. However, a quote about Williams stands out from all the rest. Playboy: Jack Gould, former television critic of The New York Times, called you ""quite possibly the most intuitively funny woman alive."" So whom does America's most intuitively funny woman find funny?After Williams' death in August, the E! ""Fashion Police"" host and red carpet veteran remembered the funnyman in a touching tribute. ""Robin was one of the great interviews,"" Rivers wrote for Time. ""You’d see him coming down that red carpet and you knew, okay, now we’re gonna have fun. We’re not gonna hear the usual, ‘Yes, we all love each other on the set' ... It’s like you open the capsule and everything came out, all the air came rushing out. You popped the champagne cork when you said hello to him."" On Thursday, other celebrities spoke of both comedians fondly:Robin Williams & Joan Rivers dead in same few weeks. Arguably the funniest man & woman of my lifetime. Thank you both for all the laughs.Joan Rivers; I smile to think she's hanging with Robin Williams right now....Imagine! Heaven must be quite a different place. Love you both.First Robin Williams and now Joan Rivers. The afterlife is so much funnier than the terrible world we're all living in right now."

She was named as 82-year-old Palmira Silva who detectives believe is of Italian descent.""While it is too early to speculate on what the motive behind this attack was I am confident, based on the information currently available to me, that it is not terrorist related,"" said Detective Chief Inspector John Sandlin who is leading the investigation.He declined to confirm reports that the woman had been beheaded, or say what weapon was used in the attack.Police said a man, 25, had been arrested on suspicion of murder by armed officers at the scene after they used a stun gun. One officer suffered a suspected broken wrist during the arrest.Earlier, there was an attempt to attack two other people at a house on the same street but they escaped unharmed.The reported nature of the killing had prompted speculation that the murder might be a terrorism incident after last year's gruesome murder of a British soldier in London, and the recent release of videos by Islamic State jihadists showing two U.S. journalists being beheaded apparently by a British national.""This is was a highly visible attack in broad daylight on a residential street,"" said Sandlin in a statement.

Scott Walker's (R) record on women's issues. The congresswoman ripped Walker at a Wednesday roundtable in Milwaukee for giving ""women the back of his hand"" by signing a bill that prevents victims of employment discrimination from seeking punitive and compensatory damages in state courts.""What Republican tea party extremists like Scott Walker are doing is they are grabbing us by the hair and pulling us back. It is not going to happen on our watch,"" she added.Republicans quickly condemned the analogy and called on Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke, who has closed to within two points of Walker according to recent polls, to denounce them.""I think the remarks were absolutely hideous and the motive behind them was despicable,"" Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch (R) said.A spokeswoman for Burke distanced the Democratic challenger from Wasserman Schultz's remarks on Wednesday.""That's not the type of language that Mary Burke would use, or has used, to point out the clear differences in this contest,"" said Burke press secretary Stephanie Wilson. ""For the last 11 months of this campaign, and in the final 9 weeks left to go, Mary is committed to pointing out those clear differences -- there is plenty that she and Governor Walker disagree on -- but those disagreements can and should be pointed out respectfully.""Read Wasserman Schultz's full statement below:I shouldn’t have used the words I used. But that shouldn't detract from the broader point that I was making that Scott Walker’s policies have been bad for Wisconsin women, whether it's mandating ultrasounds, repealing an equal pay law, or rejecting federal funding for preventative health care, Walker's record speaks for itself. As for the issue of domestic violence, it's unacceptable that a majority of Congressional Republicans opposed this critical legislation, of which I was a proud cosponsor, after blocking its reauthorization for more than a year."

I hope Joan's funeral requests are honored because that would be absolutely, positively fabulous. Just like her. pic.twitter.com/rq4pbMMJKb  She was also a woman who loved the death reel at the Oscars: A good death reel can almost compensate for five hours of French actors trying to make adorable acceptance speeches. One of my favorite things to do is guess which of the dead actors will get the most applause and who's going to be surprisingly underappreciated. It's tricky you can't always tell. Some years the most applause go to whoever died young and tragically; other years it goes to the old and beloved. I really love it when the Academy leaves a deadie out of the reel and the error of omission becomes a huge cause célèbre. Remember a few years ago when they left Bea Arthur out of the death reel [at the Oscars]? Bea Arthur! How did they leave Bea Arthur out? She was in ""Mame;"" she was in ""All in the Family;"" she was in ""Maude;"" she was a ""Golden Girl,"" for God’s sake! Bea was not only one of Hollywood’s leading ladies, she was one of Hollywood’s leading men! There are still people talking about that horrible gaffe and to this day, in Beverly Hills, when the subject comes up, people say Bea Arthur's name in a muffled whisper like they used to do when they said ""cancer.""

11,POLITICS,Everybody Calm Down About The Kansas Senate Race,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kansas-senate-race_n_5768586.html,,2014-09-04,"Greg Orman, right, an independent candidate for the U.S. Senate in Kansas, discusses his campaign during a news conference, as his wife, Sybil, watches to his left, Monday, July 28, 2014, on the south steps of the Statehouse in Topeka, Kan. Orman is portraying himself as the leading challenger for Republican Sen. Pat Roberts' seat. (AP Photo/John Hanna)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d4d5200000c70101d290.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you spent any time Wednesday scanning headlines and tweets about the Kansas Senate race, you wouldn't be thought a fool to have come away with the notion that something -- sigh ... ""game-changing"" -- had occurred. The news was that Shawnee County District Attorney Chad Taylor, the Democratic nominee in the race against incumbent Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, had pulled out of the race, leaving Roberts to compete with a Libertarian Party nominee and an independent candidate.The ensuing focus fell on the independent, Greg Orman, a businessman and founder of private equity firm Denali Partners LLC. There was good reason to have done so: Orman's campaign had long insisted that he was the real rival to Roberts, pointing to the fact that he was much more successful at fundraising than Taylor was. That argument has been effectively won by Orman at this point: The fact that Taylor's campaign was largely skint was the prevailing reason he dropped out of the race. Beyond that, Orman has cast himself as a genuine independent. His profile is that of a moderate Democrat, he voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 and Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012, and he has made it known that if he's elected, he'll caucus with whatever party is in the majority.One last thing: an Aug. 19 poll conducted by Public Policy Polling found that when Orman was slotted against Roberts in a head-to-head matchup, Orman won, 43 percent to 33 percent, over Roberts. (Less talked about was the fact that in the same matchup, the number of undecided voters rose to 24 percent, from the 17 percent undecided in both the Taylor-Roberts head-to-head and the four-way scrum among the three aforementioned candidates and Libertarian candidate Randall Batson.)Hype ensued. ""The Senate Race In Kansas Just Got Crazy,"" said FiveThirtyEight. The Washington Post's Sean Sullivan penned, ""Meet Greg Orman, the man who could decide the Senate majority."" People seemed to be reaching for their favored drape-measurement implements. And the Roberts campaign reacted with melodramatic suspicion in a statement furnished by campaign manager Leroy Towns:Chad Taylor's withdrawal from the U.S. Senate race reveals a corrupt bargain between Greg Orman and national Democrats including Senator Harry Reid that disenfranchises Kansas Democrats. It makes clear what has been obvious from the start: Orman is the choice of liberal Democrats and he can no longer hide behind an independent smokescreen.(For what it's worth, I'll point out that The New Yorker's Sam Wang reports that Orman ""has promised to vote out Democrat Harry Reid as majority leader if he gets the chance."")With all that in mind, let's calm down, shall we? There are a lot of reasons to distrust the notion that something epochal has happened in Kansas. It begins with this little remarked-upon part of Wednesday's story: ""Staff in Secretary of State Kris Kobach's office indicated Wednesday night that Taylor's name would be retained on the candidate list until legal issues related to his withdrawal could be studied. Apparently, there is uncertainty that Taylor’s affidavit met requirements of state law to renounce a nomination. Another question centers on whether the Kansas Democratic Party must select a replacement or leave the ballot blank.""See, Chad Taylor may be done with the Kansas Senate race, but that does not necessarily mean that the Kansas Senate race is done with Chad Taylor. As The Hill's Alexandra Jaffe reports, there are ""two election law statutes"" that may impede Taylor's flight from the race:One statute declares that, except under specific circumstances, ""no person who has been nominated by any means for any national, state, county or township office may"" withdraw their name from the ballot after Primary Day.According to Jaffe, a second statute indicates that if the Kansas secretary of state takes Taylor's name off the ballot, the Democratic Party may be obligated to replace him with somebody else.For the moment, however, Taylor's efforts to quit the race have gotten hung up on the former statute. According to TPM's Dylan Scott, Kris Kobach -- a Republican who you might remember as the higher mind behind many of Arizona's draconian immigration laws -- is not in any rush to do Orman or the Democrats any favors. Per Scott:During a televised press conference Thursday afternoon, Kobach read from the relevant Kansas law, specifically the provision that states a candidate must declare their incapacity to serve if elected. He said that Taylor had not made such a declaration.Of course, none of this may prove to matter, depending on how well Taylor's ""Don't actually vote for me"" campaign and Orman's ""Don't forget that Taylor dropped out of the race"" campaign combine to inform Kansas voters. But there are other factors to consider, such as, ""Maybe Orman's threat to Roberts is a wee bit overhyped, seeing as it's almost entirely based on a single PPP poll."" Here's The Monkey Cage's John Sides, considering that possibility:Orman may not be a good fit for Kansas. He ran as a Democrat in 2008. Based on these data from Stanford political scientist Adam Bonica, he seems to be left-of-center. It’s entirely possible that he won’t poll that well against Roberts if he becomes the focus of attacks by Roberts and others. In other words, the PPP poll may not indicate where the race stands now or will stand soon.Now, there's no guarantee that making Orman ""the focus of attacks"" will work. If you want to find out more about the potential dangers of running a massively funded, ""Let me tell you all about this guy who's running against me, of whom you may not have heard,"" I'll direct you to discuss the matter with former House Minority Leader Eric Cantor. (At the same time, I think there's a good chance that Roberts' campaign may have noticed what happened to Cantor.)And if you are thinking of Orman as the guy who may end up helping the Democrats maintain their Senate majority ... well, there are two schools of thought. Here's Sam Wang:To be fair, Orman is not just a Democrat in disguise -- he has promised to vote out Democrat Harry Reid as Majority Leader if he gets the chance. But Orman says that he wants to break the current gridlock in the Senate, and Senate Republicans have been gumming up the works on legislation and judicial appointments. So while Orman would be far from a shoo-in to vote for every Democratic position, he would certainly not be involved in any alliances with the Republicans.On the other hand, there's John Sides again:His election would matter most if the GOP won 50 seats and the Democrats won 49 -- allowing Orman to decide who would have the majority (since the Democrats could control the Senate with 50 votes, given Biden’s role as tie-breaker). But even in that scenario, it may be unlikely that Orman would caucus with Democrats. He will have to be reelected in a fairly red state, so it could make sense to caucus with Republicans.Yes, crazily enough, despite the fact that Orman has some significant ideological differences with the current Senate Republican caucus, there's a pretty good chance that if he manages to pull off this unlikely tight-rope walk to a Senate seat, he may actually want to keep it.So, if only for the moment, let's calm down about Kansas.READ MORE: There was a major shake-up in the Kansas Senate race.

Citing photos from the scene, the Chicago Tribune reported the piece of ""falling masonry"" was likely the head of an ornamental gargoyle on the exterior of the Second Presbyterian Church, a landmark in the neighborhood of South Loop. Witnesses told the Tribune that 34-year-old Sara Bean was crossing the street with another pedestrian just after noon when she was struck in the head by the stone, which fell from about 30 feet above. One witness told the paper he saw the scene unfold and watched the stone hit the woman then ""crash onto the pavement and split in half."" Bean, a local resident and mother of two, was taken to an area hospital, where she was pronounced dead, NBC Chicago reports. She was an employee at Lurie Children's Hospital and was planning on marrying her boyfriend, Lance Johnson, who was with her at the time of the accident at Second Presbyterian, according to the Tribune. Built in 1874, the church was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2013. Once the place of worship for prominent Chicago families like those from the Pullman rail dynasty or Marshall Fields, the church failed building inspections in 2007, 2009, 2010 and twice in 2011, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Building department records from 2010 indicated the church's outside walls had issues that included “fractures, washed out mortar at various locations, spalling (flaking) stone at various locations of the tower elevations,"" the Tribune reports. The church did, however, pass its most recent inspection in March of 2013, per media reports. "

The 81-year-old had been rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital on Aug. 28 after she stopped breathing during throat surgery at a nearby clinic. She spent the past week in and out of intensive care treatment. While Rivers will be remembered as a comedic star, her selflessness left an immeasurable impact on the causes near and dear to her heart.Rivers supported nonprofit God's Love We Deliver for decades, delivering food to HIV/AIDS patients and their families in New York City. In an interview with E News posted on the organization's YouTube channel last year, Rivers talked about her experiences trying to help friends in the early days of the epidemic. ""So many of my friends in those days were getting 'gay pneumonia,' and then when it became known as AIDS, people didn't want to touch these people,"" Rivers told E News. ""They couldn't get help. There was one hairdresser that was a very good friend of mine, and we said, 'let's start bringing him food,' and it started to grow.""God's Love We Deliver provides about 4,500 meals daily to its community. Roughly 90 percent of those served live below the poverty line. Rivers serves food at a God's Love We Deliver event in 2009.

We will form a government of national unity and will honor the participation of our people in the election process,"" the candidates said in a message read out in Kabul by Abdullah aide Mahmoud Saiqal.Talks on a power-sharing deal between Ghani, winner of the election according to an initial count, and Abdullah collapsed this week, rekindling fears of ethnic unrest over an election marred by allegations of fraud.Days earlier, Abdullah's team walked out of a U.N. audit of votes from a June 14 run-off ballot, saying it was dissatisfied with the way fraudulent votes were being handled.The political turmoil created the worst possible backdrop for a summit that heralded the end of more than a decade of inconclusive NATO combat operations against Taliban militants.Adding to a general climate of uncertainty were news reports that an Afghan army colonel had requested asylum upon arrival in Britain on Tuesday.Afghan Defense Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, asked by Reuters at a news conference, denied the officer was traveling with his delegation to the NATO summit.An Afghan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the colonel was believed to have arrived on a military exchange program, but officials were still looking into the matter.A spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense said he was aware of the reports and the matter was being investigated, declining further comment.NATO had hoped that a new president would be installed in time for the summit, enabling it to celebrate Afghanistan's first democratic transfer of power by inviting the new leader to share the spotlight with U.S. President Barack Obama.But the deadlock over the election result meant the defense minister had to come instead.The United States intervened in Afghanistan to deny al Qaeda a sanctuary after the September 11, 2001, attacks. NATO took a peacekeeping role in Kabul in 2003, gradually extending it throughout the country.Over the past 13 years, at least 16,000 civilians, nearly 3,500 foreign troops and thousands of Afghan soldiers and police have been killed.Despite NATO's costly effort in lives and cash, civilian casualties have risen sharply this year and Taliban insurgents continue to pose a serious threat to Afghan security forces who have taken over lead responsibility for security operations.The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, which now commands some 44,000 troops from 48 nations, is due to be replaced with smaller training mission from next year numbering some 12,000 people.Outgoing President Hamid Karzai refused to sign the status of forces agreements and NATO diplomats say that they will have decide on a complete withdrawal within a month unless a new president is installed by then and signs the documents.At the summit, NATO allies renewed their commitment to support Afghan forces financially until the end of 2017. Afghanistan is highly dependent on foreign donors to pay for the huge army and police force, now numbering 350,000 people.

But on Saturday, he got some good news with the bad: head coach Marvin Lewis called Still to let him know that while he didn't make the team, the Bengals were signing him to their practice squad and would continue providing insurance for his daughter's treatment. “They could have washed their hands with me and said they didn’t care about what I was going through off the field,” Still told ABC News. “It’s like a blessing in disguise for me.”His practice squad position pays $6,300 per week in salary, doesn't require Still to travel to games, keeps him from having to move to a different team, and includes full health benefits, the station reports. The last part was most crucial for Still, who on June 2 found out his daughter Leah, below, was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma. After the devastating news, Still's focus turned from football to family, and as a result his performance on the field suffered. He left the team’s minicamp practices to split time between his home in Delaware and Leah’s treatment facility in Philadelphia, ESPN reports. ""I can't give football 100 percent right now,"" Still told The Cincinnati Enquirer. ""In the business aspect they want guys to solely focus on football, which is understandable. We are here to win this city a Super Bowl and right now I am not in a position where I can give football 100 percent of everything I have.""Lewis told the paper he believes Still will eventually rejoin the roster. ""We have two good quality guys [including center Trevor Robinson] who at some point will be on the 53-man roster, almost undoubtedly,"" Lewis told the Enquirer. ""We're fortunate enough to have them here right now as reserves for us.""Still was drafted 53rd overall by the Bengals back in 2012. Last season, the former Penn State captain injured his elbow and suffered a herniated disc in his back; during a preseason game this year he injured his hamstring and has since been sidelined, the Enquirer reports. He has an even bigger challenge ahead. “We’re going to go to battle with cancer,” Still said. “She’s willing to put up a fight to beat it.” "

Ohio is expected to be a pivotal state again in the 2016 presidential election.The Republican-controlled state legislature in February approved a law that truncated the period to 28 days from 35, eliminating the early part of the period that had allowed people to register and cast ballots the same day.Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted also issued uniform early voting hours that went farther, excluding multiple Sunday and all evening voting hours on weekdays.Husted said he would appeal the decision.""Today's ruling kicks the door open to having different rules for voting in each of Ohio's 88 counties, which is not fair and uniform and was not even acceptable to this court or the plaintiffs previously,"" Husted said in a statement.The judge's ruling would enjoin Husted from preventing county election boards from adding more hours than required by the order.The Ohio Chapter of the NAACP, the League of Women Voters of Ohio and a number of churches filed a lawsuit challenging the changes, saying they would suppress turnout by minorities and the poor.Groups supporting the legislation have said that eliminating ""golden week"" would help reduce voter fraud and shortening early voting hours would reduce costs by 20 percent.Supporters of keeping early voting unchanged said African Americans made up 78 percent of all early in-person, or EIP, voters in 2008.""African Americans in Ohio are more likely than other groups to utilize EIP voting in general and to rely on evening and Sunday voting hours,"" Economus wrote.As such, he found, plaintiffs have demonstrated a strong likelihood the legislation and directive from the secretary of state would ""result in fewer opportunities for African Americans to participate in the electoral process.""Early voting in Ohio is scheduled to start on Sept. 30.

18,ENTERTAINMENT,Commemorate Joan Rivers With The Great Doc 'A Piece Of Work',Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joan-rivers-a-piece-of-work_n_5730594.html,,2014-09-04,"THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JOHNNY CARSON -- Air Date 09/26/1983 -- Pictured: Guest host Joan Rivers on September 23, 1983 (Photo by Gene Arias/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d1968228000007286fa400.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Many trailblazers have documentaries made about them, but the most trenchant career retrospective on film from the past decade may be that of Joan Rivers, who died Thursday at the age of 81. ""Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,"" the celebrated 2010 documentary about the temperamental seasons that befell the comedian's career, is as much a revelatory exploration of Rivers' legacy as it is a searing portrait of a life married to show-biz aspirations and the mercurial treatment Hollywood sometimes bestows on its most devout denizens. Younger audiences often think of Rivers as the crass queen of the red carpet, relegated to hurling jabs at celebrities' sartorial choices at award shows and on the weekly E! series ""Fashion Police."" To the untrained eye, the final decade of Rivers' life may feel like it barely cracks the B list. But anyone who's seen ""A Piece of Work,"" listened to Rivers truly reflect on her career or who can otherwise recall the apex of late-night television that proliferated in the 1960s will know that the comedian has attained nothing short of vanguard-level prestige. Filmed over the course of 14 months, ""A Piece of Work"" begins at a low point in Rivers' career. She bemoans the white space in her datebook, which in her mind signals a lack of desirability. But that nadir, like so many of the comedian's others, turns into another success story. By the end, she's been invited to participate in an all-star George Carlin tribute, landed the ""Fashion Police"" gig and won ""The Celebrity Apprentice."" Rivers didn't reclaim the dominance she achieved during her days as a frequent Johnny Carson guest and the permanent guest host of ""The Tonight Show""  -- when she also became a regular on the variety-show circuit (""The Carol Burnett Show,"" ""Hollywood Squares,"" ""Saturday Night Live"") and was nominated for a Grammy for her 1983 comedy album -- but no matter: Rivers had long ago secured legend status. By the time the documentary crew finds her, she has nothing left to prove, even if she refuses to take a day off.The comedy Rivers introduced that first time she was called over to join Carson onstage in 1965, which makes for one of many poignant moments in ""A Piece of Work,"" was unprecedented. Rivers recalled men cautioning her against jokes about subjects like abortion, saying ladies shouldn't speak of such things. ""You are so wrong,"" she says. ""This is exactly what we should be talking about."" And therein lied Rivers' brass. Her brand of humor and bawdy persona is sprinkled across the entire modern comedy landscape, male and female, young and old. Her refusal to bend to the judgment of the men in her life or the executives lording over Hollywood starlets is what made -- and, in some unfortunate ways, dampened -- her career. Carson's fury when Rivers left NBC in 1986 to host her own talk show is an episode for the Hollywood history books: a scorned disciple cast off by her famed mentor, left to pick up the pieces of the self-confidence he helped to imbue in her. It's from that point, as the documentary candidly depicts, that Rivers lost some of her mojo. The troubles that revved up in the wake of Carson having her blacklisted from NBC -- from internal brawls with Fox to sinking ratings and ultimately her husband's suicide -- is perhaps one of the most enlightening depictions of the fleeting nature of fame. Even though she revived her talk-show presence at the end of the '80s with a daytime program that scored her an Emmy for Outstanding Talk Show Host, it wasn't hard to assess the waning stature she unfairly received despite being a primo trailblazer. But look closer. Listen to her stand-up comedy bits; they ooze with honesty. Hear her talk about why it's vital to use laughter as a coping mechanism for tragedy. Look at her palatial New York penthouse. Watch as she recalls the days when Joan Rivers was an institution, and then look as she proves that no matter the setbacks or the harsh judgment she too often received, she still is. It's easy to prove the Joan Rivers stamp has manifested itself in the likes of Sandra Bernhard and Kathy Griffin and Amy Schumer, but that isn't giving Rivers enough credit. Even if not everyone appreciated her churlishness, the role she has played in destigmatizing taboo topics must be celebrated, as proven when an 83-year-old Don Rickles fawns over her in ""A Piece of Work."" That impact is, of course, overshadowed by the shallowness of red-carpet fanfare, just as Rivers' tour-de-force career is dwarfed by fame's abhorrent treatment of aging women. In the movie, she addresses the incessant plastic surgery and the way she started as a rare advocate and ended as a punching bag. She speaks with a glasnost that celebrities rarely do. Making a warts-and-all documentary in one's late 70s is itself quite daring, and for that the movie is both touching and provocative. Rivers always wanted to be an actress but was never taken seriously once she developed her coarse comedic aura, so instead she sums up her career in one of the most evocative self-reflections of any timeworn celebrity: ""My life is an actress's life,"" she says while tearing up. ""I play a comedian."" It's one of the documentary's saddest, most revealing moments, and yet she doesn't despair or quit. She was still the resilient Joan Rivers she was when Carson dumped her on the NBC studio lot in 1986.""A Piece of Work"" proves that Rivers ended her storied life the same way she began her fame: with the candor that is rigorously sought and seldom found in persons of notoriety. Watching the documentary is like visiting an old friend whose prime many of us only experienced vicariously. At one point, Rivers responds to an interview question about wanting to be liked for her soul instead of for superficial qualities: ""I just want to be liked,"" she says. She doesn't care why or how. She, like so many of us, just wanted to be appreciated. Mission accomplished, Joan.Directed by Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg, ""Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work"" is currently available to stream instantly on Netflix or rent on iTunes."

In merely one year, what began as a fledgling dream has manifested into a blazing force set out to improve millions of lives. In order to graciously thank our staff and supporters, we hosted a traditional Dominican fiesta, fit with an abundance of healthy Dominican food, friends, and family. As a team, we happily embrace this year's accomplishments as we continue full-speed on the voyage ahead.At S4S, we are building environmentally sustainable high schools in impoverished areas that afford students the skills to grow organic food, manage waste, harvest and purify water, and build renewable energy technologies. These efforts will simultaneously combat climate change, alleviate poverty, improve access to education, and increase food security. Our first destination: the Dominican Republic. Our organization now happily claims 501c(3) nonprofit status, a fantastic pro-bono staff of 60 talented individuals, and political support. Yet, as with many endeavors of this magnitude, our journey to this point has not been an easy one.Just one year ago, in August 2013, S4S was simply a dream. For 9 years, Alyssa Ramos Reynoso, Executive Director of Vision, imagined a school in which children could concurrently live, gain an education, learn the skills to establish financial independence, and protect the planet. Upon sharing this vision with Adrienne Redd, Executive of Strategy, and Jacqueline Crutchley, Executive of Administration, the fundamental goal of transforming this dream into reality materialized. With intense drive, there was fervent eagerness to embark on new frontiers. However, three challenges stood in the way: no office, no funding and tight time constraints. Left to Right: Alyssa Ramos-Reynoso and Jacqueline CrutchleyWe determined that people are the most valuable asset to any organization. We believe that skills, networks and connections can yield many things that currency cannot, as social capital is infinite, imaginative, dynamic, and renewable. Heeding this mindset, S4S was founded on core principles such as compassion, respect and love. With these tenets guiding our actions, S4S has developed a culture that flourishes with acceptance, dedication and benevolence. Due to this environment, this organization has attracted a team of 60 socially-minded individuals. After investing countless hours, S4S can boast many successes. Left to Right: Adrienne Redd, Bob Hamburg, John Ungar, Daniel Endy, and Elyse EndyTo commemorate our members, their hard work, and the rich history of our first destination, we celebrated S4S's birthday with a Dominican fiesta. We served traditional Dominican food such as rice and beans, tostones (known as fried plantains in English), organic meat, organic salad, and gluten-free desserts. Our goal of this barbeque was to honor one of the primary indigenous societies of the Caribbean, the Taíno.The Taíno established settlement in Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) between 1200 and 1500 AD1. Culturally, they were resourceful, imaginative and generous. They created ornate pottery, developed an herbal medicine system and shared many indigenous crops such as yucca and maize2. In 1492, upon Christopher Colombus' arrival, Spaniards colonized Hispaniola, igniting the decline of the Taíno civilization. Taíno women fell prey to sexual violence, and men and women alike were debased into slavery. Eventually, the spread of infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles claimed the remaining majority of the Taíno2. Taíno customs have greatly influenced American culture. They introduced concepts such as the hammock, the canoe, and the barbeque. At S4S, we pay respect to those who endured slavery and oppression by offering services to grant hope, love and compassion. At our barbeque, we acknowledged the legacy of the Taíno; and in our service to the Dominican Republic, we exercise deep cultural appreciation. Our accomplishments are a testament to the fact that a great deal can happen in one year. With enough dedication, anything is possible. Here at S4S, we aim to maintain a balance of humility and tenacity as we work toward a bright future on the horizon.References 1. History of the Taino Indians. (2004).

In merely one year, what began as a fledgling dream has manifested into a blazing force set out to improve millions of lives. In order to graciously thank our staff and supporters, we hosted a traditional Dominican fiesta, fit with an abundance of healthy Dominican food, friends, and family. As a team, we happily embrace this year's accomplishments as we continue full-speed on the voyage ahead.At S4S, we are building environmentally sustainable high schools in impoverished areas that afford students the skills to grow organic food, manage waste, harvest and purify water, and build renewable energy technologies. These efforts will simultaneously combat climate change, alleviate poverty, improve access to education, and increase food security. Our first destination: the Dominican Republic. Our organization now happily claims 501c(3) nonprofit status, a fantastic pro-bono staff of 60 talented individuals, and political support. Yet, as with many endeavors of this magnitude, our journey to this point has not been an easy one.Just one year ago, in August 2013, S4S was simply a dream. For 9 years, Alyssa Ramos Reynoso, Executive Director of Vision, imagined a school in which children could concurrently live, gain an education, learn the skills to establish financial independence, and protect the planet. Upon sharing this vision with Adrienne Redd, Executive of Strategy, and Jacqueline Crutchley, Executive of Administration, the fundamental goal of transforming this dream into reality materialized. With intense drive, there was fervent eagerness to embark on new frontiers. However, three challenges stood in the way: no office, no funding and tight time constraints. Left to Right: Alyssa Ramos-Reynoso and Jacqueline CrutchleyWe determined that people are the most valuable asset to any organization. We believe that skills, networks and connections can yield many things that currency cannot, as social capital is infinite, imaginative, dynamic, and renewable. Heeding this mindset, S4S was founded on core principles such as compassion, respect and love. With these tenets guiding our actions, S4S has developed a culture that flourishes with acceptance, dedication and benevolence. Due to this environment, this organization has attracted a team of 60 socially-minded individuals. After investing countless hours, S4S can boast many successes. Left to Right: Adrienne Redd, Bob Hamburg, John Ungar, Daniel Endy, and Elyse EndyTo commemorate our members, their hard work, and the rich history of our first destination, we celebrated S4S's birthday with a Dominican fiesta. We served traditional Dominican food such as rice and beans, tostones (known as fried plantains in English), organic meat, organic salad, and gluten-free desserts. Our goal of this barbeque was to honor one of the primary indigenous societies of the Caribbean, the Taíno.The Taíno established settlement in Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) between 1200 and 1500 AD1. Culturally, they were resourceful, imaginative and generous. They created ornate pottery, developed an herbal medicine system and shared many indigenous crops such as yucca and maize2. In 1492, upon Christopher Colombus' arrival, Spaniards colonized Hispaniola, igniting the decline of the Taíno civilization. Taíno women fell prey to sexual violence, and men and women alike were debased into slavery. Eventually, the spread of infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles claimed the remaining majority of the Taíno2. Taíno customs have greatly influenced American culture. They introduced concepts such as the hammock, the canoe, and the barbeque. At S4S, we pay respect to those who endured slavery and oppression by offering services to grant hope, love and compassion. At our barbeque, we acknowledged the legacy of the Taíno; and in our service to the Dominican Republic, we exercise deep cultural appreciation. Our accomplishments are a testament to the fact that a great deal can happen in one year. With enough dedication, anything is possible. Here at S4S, we aim to maintain a balance of humility and tenacity as we work toward a bright future on the horizon.References 1. History of the Taino Indians. (2004).

Twenty-four Southern California artists offer compelling images that portray their individual interpretations of myths ranging from Classical Greek and Roman to East Indian, Latin American and Iranian. Each visual image is accompanied by a retelling of the myth. Through their visual work these artists vividly connect the modern world to ancient tales, revealing a personal relevance that lies within mythology. Methods of depiction vary from painting and drawing to sculpture, video and mixed media installation.Myth and Image runs through September 18 with a reception September 4 at El Camino College Art GalleryDoug Aitken: Still Life | This exhibition features an installation of new sculptural objects within a labyrinthine space designed to create an experience of unexpected encounters and a sense of mystery and discovery for the viewer to navigate. Spanning a variety of media encompassing photography, sculpture, publications, sound, and single and multi-channel video installations, Aitken's work explores the modern landscape and posits possibilities for new uncharted frontiers.Taking its name from the traditional concept of nature morte, Aitken's Still Life presents an immersive environment where place and time dissolves, where the individual exists adrift in an electrically charged space.

Doug Aitken: Still Life opens September 6 at Regen ProjectsAudra Weaser: Immersion | While Weaser's paintings read as landscapes, her approach rests in the realm of abstraction, where intuition and material process play off one another. Through her rigorous layering and reductive process, Weaser strikes a balance between a Turner-like notion of the sublime forces in nature, with the visual and technical intents similar to the French impressionists.Weaser begins with loose charcoal sketches of remembered landscapes, which are then obscured by numerous coats of specially mixed acrylic. She continues by excavating through successive layers of media, allowing a version of the original drawing and intention to emerge as a new atmospheric composition. Flecks of light, and cascades of pigment emerge through chalky white paint, suggesting a distant landscape, trees reflecting on rippling water or light striking against a frozen plane or breaking through a forest.Audra Weaser: Immersion opens September 6 at Ruth Bachofner GalleryTorey Thornton: Some Narrow Sleeping | Thornton presents a group of paintings depicting content that articulates a visual concept falling on a spectrum between realism and abstraction. Torey Thornton's straightforward medium emphasizes the flatness of surface, and his approach at rendering imagery exaggerates the crudeness of his forms. Inspired by collage and readily accessible material, Thornton's narratives break tradition through idiosyncratic arrangements and refined simplicity.For the past year, the artist has been concerned with the idea of perception -- how the mind perceives an image. Thornton's new work involves visual manipulations of scale and perspective, which inherently confuse interpretation -- what might appear as a horizon line to one person could look like a tabletop to another.

People with generally low levels of adrenaline need a boost to ""feel alive."" While people whose levels are usually high, quickly become anxious when over-stimulated.I'm of the latter category. Even a scary book makes my heart beat faster, and I get so uncomfortable in suspenseful movies that I want to leave. The feeling of being frightened is deeply unpleasant-- I do all I can to avoid being in such situations.My granddaughter, on the other hand, loves to be scared. She thinks it's fun. A large number of people must agree, considering how many movies are made just to raise adrenaline levels. Steven Spielberg said in an interview that during a preview of Jaws, he saw someone leave as the shark was swallowing a man and thought: ""It's a flop."" Then he saw the person throw up and return, and he thought: ""It's a blockbuster.""Addictions to emotional highs are not very different from addictions to alcohol or drugs. Without the stimulation, one feels low key, empty, or even depressed.Some people can only work under pressure-- deadlines are motivators. I'm always several columns ahead, and I handed in reports early in college. Deadlines make me anxious. I can work under pressure if I have to, but I hate the feeling it generates.Why do people continue working at a hard and fast pace when they could retire and don't need the money? A newly retired friend of mine recently said to me, ""I miss the challenge, I miss risk taking, I miss having the control.""Another friend, a recently-retired CEO, said, ""Who am I if I'm not a manager, if I'm not in charge, if I don't have the opportunity to make important decisions?""What these persons miss, besides their job identities and the daily adventure that work provides, is being looked up to by colleagues and staff, being someone who matters, feeling responsible, and being challenged, all of which contribute to a ""high.""The people who retire most happily are college professors who have experience filling up their time in productive ways during the long summer vacations.Interestingly enough, stress addiction can be harmful to some-- potentially leading to heart attacks-- but not to all. For some, the release of adrenaline in the blood stream might increase resistance to disease through the production of lymphocytes.In other words, stress may be bad for some individuals, but good for others. Some people thrive living in the fast lane, getting high on violent video games and extreme sports. People addicted to adrenaline seek ways to get these surges and when deprived of them become irritable or depressed.I get a ""high"" when I see a good performance in a theater or have a particularly stimulating conversation, and that's enough for me. After all, what is ""having a good time"" but a ""high""?Seeing a destructive storm on television, hearing someone else's bad news or a dramatic story also provide a small kick, which explains people's preoccupation with sensational trials and sex scandals.What gives you a high? How much of it do you need and with what intensity? Being aware of one's needs for adrenaline highs is already half the battle in seeking what one must have to feel alive. This will give you control over your behaviors and not let you fall prey to unconscious motivations and needs.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

The protests were sparked after Michael Brown, an unarmed black man was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson police officer on Aug. 9, 2014. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d44d2100002501c964c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A young unarmed black man is suspected of committing a petty theft, is confronted by a police officer and, trying to flee, he is shot in the head and killed. His grieving family and angered community turn to the legal system to vindicate his life; to stand for the idea that no system can be labeled a justice system if it ignores the killing of a young man merely on suspicion of a minor crime. Though outraged, they are told to put their faith in the legal system, to let justice run its course. They are told they will be heard. I am not writing of the recent tragic death of 18 year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri but rather that of Edward Garner, in Memphis, Tennessee some 40 years ago. (No, not Eric Garner, the unarmed Black man who was choked to death just over a month ago by police on Staten Island... sigh...) That long ago case was both simpler and more complicated than the latest painful eruption in Ferguson. Simpler because though Garner had stolen a purse with 10 dollars from a home, there was also no question that he was unarmed and running away from the police officer when he was shot and killed. The case was more complex because at the time, police in Tennessee were permitted to shoot even unarmed suspects, to stop them from escaping. The undercurrents of the case were even more complicated than the one currently faced in Missouri. Edward Garner, killed all those many years ago on a dark night in Memphis, was shot by Elton Hymon, an African-American police officer.Why bring up this nearly four decades old case in the wake of (yet another) unarmed black man shot by a police officer? Because Edward Garner does not just haunt the questions surrounding the shooting of Michael Brown; the 40-year-old shooting in Memphis undermines the answers so many are offering as the ""solution"" to our problems in Ferguson. The indictment is stark; in the face of ceaseless cycle of police violence turned frustration turned community violence, families who have lost their sons and communities torn apart deserve more than being placated by hastily adding a few darker faces to the police force and admonitions to let the system play out. We all need more than the oft-repeated milquetoast, ""America needs to start a conversation..."" Take the first popular answer, focusing on the complexion of the Ferguson police department. Various commentators have noted that less than a handful of police officers in Ferguson are African-American. The Ferguson police force, like too many across the country, has come to look too much like a foreign occupation force as that city has grown increasingly African-American over the years. Attempting to make some political and symbolic progress, Governor Nixon nominated Daniel Isom II, a former St. Louis police chief to become the director of the state's Department of Public Safety. Isom would become the only African-American in Governor Nixon's cabinet.It is important for a variety of reasons that police forces exhibit diversity; it is important that all citizens see themselves reflected in those who are charged with enforcing the law by force. But remembering the death of Garner should give pause in assuming that adding African-American police chiefs and officers will be a panacea to the deep structural tension between much of the African-American community and the police. Garner's shooting revealed that violence and death are aimed at black men; the Supreme Court was shown evidence that black suspects engaged in similar behavior as white suspects were over twice as likely to be shot at by police. It remains true today that African-Americans are disproportionately more likely to suffer from incidents of police brutality. But just as Garner was shot dead by an African-American police officer, at the time one of only a handful on the Memphis police force, it remains questionable that merely adding officers of color will lead to a decrease in either unjustly disproportionate policing or, for that matter, unjustifiable police force. As Yale law professor James Forman explores in a forthcoming book, there is little evidence to suggest that having more African-American police officers or even political leaders by itself changes police practices.The second response to the mass unrest in Ferguson has been the common refrain, ""Let the system play out."" By itself, the phrase seems unassailably right. With conflicting eye-witness reports and the inherent dangers of being a police officer, no one should rush to judgment. Still again, the 40-year old case is telling. The shooting of Edward Garner resulted in a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court and a ruling that finding that shooting unarmed suspects who pose no danger to the community was, in the dry language of the law, an unreasonable method of seizure. Yet a funny thing happened on its way up the courts. By the time the case reached the Supreme Court, there was no mention at all of the racial disparity in the violence visited on citizens. More to the point, the highest court in our land has, time after time, refused to thoughtfully address the interaction between race and policing, either dismissing it casually or refusing to mention it at all. In one particularly startling example, when addressing the racial impact of the nearly unfettered discretion of the police to pull over drivers, the Court held that an officer's motivation, whether racist or not, has no effect on the reasonableness of a stop. Motorists who felt the police targeted them due to race would have to prove it in the notoriously difficult to prove 14th Amendment litigation. Thus, the Court insulated the police from being called to account for stopping African-Americans for ""driving while black.""  The point is not just that our legal system is impoverished in allowing conversations about the interaction of race and policing but that our current jurisprudence purposefully turns a deaf ear to many of the complaints of African-Americans and other minorities regarding the routine use of police force. Because the easy answers in Ferguson fall far short of what is needed so I will not end by offering any quick solutions of my own. Whatever the answer, it requires much deeper engagement between police and minority communities that evidences respect, concern and care; that give voice to real frustrations and create enough trust that police and citizens see themselves as partners in a civic project rather than as enemies and occupiers. One example may be found in Los Angeles, which despite its troubled past (and present) is currently also dealing with a police shooting of Ezell Ford, unarmed African-American with much more success. In the words of the Los Angeles Assistant Police Chief, Earl Paysinger, ""We've learned that community outreach can't wait for the day when you're in trouble and need help."" We will all mourn Michael Brown's death and wait to know more about what happened that night. What is clear, however, is that platitudes about ""starting a conversation"" will not do. From Edward Garner to Michael Brown, ghosts from long ago intoned that easy answers will not do."
