The newspaper wrote that Morgan’s home is filled with exotic animals including snakes and sharks. (We weren't surprised by the latter, since we saw the shark tank installed on Animal Planet's ""Tanked."") The Post also noted that Morgan has a last-supper mural on one of his walls featuring Lucille Ball, George Carlin, Bernie Mac, Richard Pryor and Charlie Chaplin, amongst other comic geniuses as apostles. Yeah, maybe he does have more in common with Tracy Jordan than we thought.Watch the video below to see Morgan play animal-loving Fellow and head over to the New York Post for the full story.Have something to say?

But where are they looking?While 59 percent of Americans have found health information online, a smaller but still substantial number -- 35 percent -- say they have logged online specifically to try to learn what a particular symptom meant. Luckily, the number of people who first approach a doctor for diagnosis, 70 percent of respondents, is twice the percentage of those who use online diagnostic tools, but the latter statistic is still rather high. About 46 percent of those who went online reported subsequently going to a medical professional to confirm a diagnosis and for treatment, while 38 percent opted for self-care and stopped after their online search. Notably, those with more education and higher incomes were both more likely to use the Internet as a primary diagnostic tool. Perhaps the following statistic will be sobering for these DIYers: 18 percent of those who went to the doctor following a self-diagnosis were given a different diagnosis by the professionals.
