0,DIVORCE,Kanye West and Kim Kardashian: Reflections on Ironclad Prenup,"Natasha Hastings, Contributor
USA track & field sprinter, Olympic gold medalist and certifie...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kanye-west-and-kim-kardashian_us_5b9d9fe8e4b03a1dcc8a642c,"While empire-building and image are often on the forefront of the minds of celebrities, a messy divorce without an ironclad prenuptial agreement can be just as devastating to an empire built upon a sophisticated branding machine as a bad public relations move.",2013-10-28,2013-10-26-CelebritysocialnetworkpicturespP8GviUcVeWl.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-10-26-CelebritysocialnetworkpicturespP8GviUcVeWl-thumb.jpg,"Social media continues to buzz with the recent engagement of reality superstar, Kim Kardashian  and music mogul, Kanye West. While anyone who has been bitten by the ""love bug"" believes and  hopes their upcoming marriage and impending vows will last forever, it is always smart to  protect oneself in the case cupid's arrow flies in the other direction. Kim Kardashian's net worth is somewhere in the range of $40-50 million while Kanye is  reported to be worth in excess of $100 million. While empire-building and image are often on the forefront of the minds of celebrities, a messy divorce without an ironclad prenuptial agreement can be just as devastating to an empire built upon a sophisticated branding machine as a bad public relations move. In this day and age, most stars with significant net worth and earning potential ask their  new love to sign a prenup before tying the knot.   So here are some things Kim and Kanye may want to consider: Each will have to disclose the nature of all of current his/her assets to other. This means disclosing current net worth including real estate, cash, stocks and any other investments. This disclosure from both sides needs to be completely detailed, accurate, open and honest.   Kim and Kanye will both have to quantify how their union could impact the other's branding and earning potential. In this day of quick rise to fame and even quicker fall from fame, the monetary boost or bust each may experience if they were to have a messy public split would need to be reduced to present-day numbers. Usually it works like this in Hollywood, the wronged-party experiences a surge in popularity while the philander suffers a ratings nightmare (think Sandra Bullock and Jesse James). For instance, Kim's large following could turn against Kanye with social media if he stepped out on her thereby indirectly decreasing his records sales for a period of time. The parties may want to consider confidentiality clauses with regard to reasons for future separation as a component of their prenuptial agreement. However, a good legal team would need to include public relations experts as advisors on potential impact of divorce-related issues which could be contemplated in the drafting of the prenup.   Also, many prenups take into account the length of the marriage as well as contingencies such as the birth of future children. Kim and Kanye may want to sit down and have a discussion about number of children as a prenuptial agreement may include increasing payouts to a party based on the increasing number of children. Normally, prenuptial agreements have what is known as a sunset clause meaning that if the parties are married for longer than a certain number of years, then the prenup will not apply and the laws of the state of residence will prevail. A future child custody issue cannot be contemplated or negotiated as part of a prenuptial agreement, so which parent may get custody of little North in case of a break-up is an issue that could only be decided if or until the parties actually initiated divorce proceedings at some future date. Perhaps the most important issue that should be addressed in the prenuptial agreement would be the allocation or division of assets Kim and Kanye derive from their joint promotional efforts. All in all, we hope that Kimye's marriage lasts, or at least longer than 72 days that is."

Either way, you can make this meal completely ahead of time. To get in on the fun, you'll need a few things. For one, black spaghetti, which is colored with squid ink, is essential. You cook black pasta just as you would regular pasta. Check out my tutorial on how to cook pasta perfectly. There are also directions on how to perfectly pre-cook pasta, which you'll need if you plan on hosting a party. Because who wants to cook pasta to-order during a shindig? Not you.You'll also need bocconcini, mini balls of fresh mozzarella cheese, canned black olives (the one and only time I'll encourage them), tomato sauce, and a batch of meatballs. Make your favorite recipe or use one of mine: classic meatballs made with beef and pork or turkey meatballs.Serving carrot sticks with dinner is veggie-lite, I know, but this is a Halloween meal after all. It'll do. To make carrot sticks festive, turn them into witch fingers using a bit of cream cheese and almond slivers. Then, dessert. Bake up your favorite chocolate sheet cake and whip up your best chocolate frosting. Top the two with ground up chocolate cookie dirt (confession: I used chocolate Teddy Grahams!) and tea biscuit tombstones (I wrote the sayings on them using food coloring pens).Teddy Grahams?!Food coloring pens?!Eyeballs on worms?!Yes, to all of it.

But once you've taken the first bite, your taste buds will be smitten not just by the delicious warm-apple flavors, but by the zestful orange and the zingy tequila too.An apple dessert that satisfies both the child in you and your adult self.Time to dig in!Apple-Walnut Crisps with TequilaServes 6 Active time: 30 minFor the apples 8 medium Gala, Fuji, Braeburn or other firm-fleshed apples - peeled, cored and cut in 1/2"" slices 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon zest of 1 orange - finely grated with a microplane grater (1 1/2 teaspoons) 1/4 cup turbinado sugarFor the topping 1 cup unbleached all purpose flour 1/2 cup turbinado sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon pinch sea salt 4 oz (115 g) (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter - cold, cut in 1"" chunks 1/2 cup walnut pieces vanilla ice cream 6 tablespoons Reposado or Añejo Tequila 6 one-cup capacity ramequins - lightly butteredPreheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Step 1: Place the apple slices in a large bowl and sprinkle with the lemon juice, cinnamon, orange zest and sugar. Toss well and set aside.Step 2: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt. Process at high speed for 15 seconds until well blended. Add the chunks of butter and process until crumbly. Add the walnuts and pulse a few more times until large, moist crumbs form. Do not over-process or the crumbs will form a dough.Step 3: Place the apple slices into the prepared molds. Sprinkle with the crisp topping. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, until topping is golden-brown and apples are bubbly. Remove from the oven and let cool until warm.Step 4: Place each ramequin on a dessert plate. Top with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon tequila and serve immediately.Cook's note: The crisps can be baked up to 12 hours ahead. To re-heat, preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) and bake for 6 to 8 minutes until warm, and serve as above. The crisps are best consumed the day they're made. To make a large crisp, bake in a medium baking dish instead of individual ramequins. Follow the same directions. (Might require an extra 5 minutes of baking time.)* * *How about poaching firm-flesh apples in maple syrup and Calvados? The resulting concoction makes the most sinfully delicious topping for these ricotta pancakes."
