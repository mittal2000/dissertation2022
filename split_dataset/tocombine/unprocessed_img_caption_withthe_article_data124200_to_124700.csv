He also didn't score the last points for Kentucky. But the sophomore may have scored the most acrobatic and unforgettable points of Kentucky's thrilling win over Wisconsin at the Final Four. ""He's playing fearless and he's just almost reckless, which is great for him because of his athleticism,"" Kentucky head coach John Calipari said of Poythress after his team earned a spot in the national championship game. The 6-foot-8 forward has often and understandably been overshadowed by Calipari's latest group of freshman stars during the season but he delivered a can't-miss performance at AT&T Stadium on Saturday night. Scoring on all four of his shots, Poythress produced eight of the loudest points in the 2014 NCAA Tournament. With Kentucky off to a slow start against Bo Ryan's Badgers, Poythress scored his first basket of the night on alley-opp pass from teammate James Young. After scoring just that one basket in the first half, the 20-year-old from Clarksville, Tenn., got his six-point second half started with a prescient tip in that only hinted at the improvisation and power that was to come.

(GIF via @HPbasketball)""We need to start a run, just think about your brothers that have just been through all the hardships with you, been through all the tribulations, everything, just think about them,"" Poythress later said when asked about his thought process during his team's late surge. Here is another look at the hardship he visited upon Wisconsin's Sam Dekker. (GIF via @mshamburger1)With the game tied 69-69 a short while later and the clock ticking toward two minutes remaining, Poythress again showed off his breathtaking athleticism. Grabbing an ambitious lob from teammate Andrew Harrison, he managed an acrobatic lay-in to give the Wildcats the late lead. While those watching at home and from the Wisconsin bench were likely surprised by the ridiculous hookup between Harrison and Poythress, Kentucky's Julius Randle was not. ""I didn't think it was too high,"" Randle told reporters after Kentucky's 74-73 win when asked about the pass and score. ""We have seen Alex do some freak things in practice and there was no way he wasn't getting that ball.""Wisconsin quickly called a timeout after Poythress' latest and last jaw-dropping basket. Kentucky coach John Calipari welcomed his oft-overshadowed sophomore star to the sideline with a hug and a kiss.

2,WELLNESS,E-cigarettes: Is Liquid Nicotine Safe?,"Ruth Macklin, Contributor

The National Association of Attorneys General on September 24, issued a letter urging the US Food and Drug Administration to clamp down on the fast-growing e-cigarette market, saying manufacturers are enticing teenagers to smoke with cartoon characters, television ads and bubble-gum flavors. AFP PHOTO / Jim WATSON (Photo credit should read JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df5d81f00002d0021d057.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The debate over e-cigarettes has been heating up. Are the smokeless, battery-powered, nicotine-dispensing devices a gateway to smoking for young people or a helpful way for smokers to quit? Public health experts can be found on both sides of the debate.An article in the New York Times on Feb. 22 cited two leading figures, Dr. Michael Siegler from Boston University and Dr. Stanton A. Glantz from the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Siegler maintains that e-cigarettes, ""could be the end of smoking in America,"" while Dr. Glantz contends that not only could they lure children into smoking, but they also could keep adults hooked on the habit. One problem with this debate is that there has been insufficient evidence to confirm or deny either of these claims.Evidence Lacking that E-Cigs Help Smokers Quit That is beginning to change. One small study reported in JAMA Internal Medicine on March 24 found that e-cigarette use by smokers was not followed by greater rates of quitting or by reduction in cigarette consumption one year later. This finding appears to support Dr. Glantz's concern. Although the authors acknowledge several limitations to their study, they argue that, ""regulations should prohibit advertising claiming or suggesting that e-cigarettes are effective smoking cessation devices until claims are supported by scientific evidence.""Risks of Liquid Nicotine Even more troubling than the lack of significant evidence in support of opposing claims about the risks and benefits of e-cigarettes is the harm that can be caused by the liquid nicotine used in the device. Another article in the New York Times, which appeared on the same day the JAMA research was published, reported on accidental poisonings, especially among children, and cases involving harm to adults. In its liquid form, nicotine is a powerful neurotoxin that can be absorbed through the skin. The Times article cites toxicologists who warn that liquid nicotine poses a significant risk to public health.What, if anything, should be done to minimize the risks of harm, especially to children? Would it be sufficient to require warning labels on the containers of liquid nicotine available for sale? Some producers are already using such labels voluntarily, but apparently that has not been successful in protecting adults or children from the harmful accidents that have occurred. The FDA does not (yet) regulate e-cigarettes; the Times article says the agency plans to regulate but has not disclosed details. Given the many years that elapsed before the FDA began to regulate tobacco products in 2009, it may be some time before the agency has sufficient empirical evidence to justify its intrusion into the marketplace for these new products. More Guidance Needed At the very least, we need public health announcements about the dangers of liquid nicotine -- both when the product is inhaled and when it comes into contact with skin. One woman was admitted to the hospital with cardiac problems when her e-cigarette broke while she was in bed. To help in preventing inadvertent use by children, the childproof caps commonly used for all sorts of medications and household products are an easy fix. But beyond those initial steps, it remains unclear what else is warranted from a public health standpoint. Although commercial enterprises detest government regulation, the CEO of an e-cigarette company was quoted in the March 24 Times article as saying, ""Honestly, we kind of welcome some kind of rules and regulations around this liquid.""A principle of public health ethics, known as the precautionary principle, holds that, ""when an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically"" (Staff, Science and Environmental Health Network, Jan. 26, 1998, Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle). This rather formal way of saying ""better safe than sorry"" is a helpful warning, but fails to give clear guidance. The options for a regulatory agency range from merely requiring warning labels to limiting what advertisements for a product can say to banning it altogether from the marketplace. Since the last option is highly unlikely in the case of liquid nicotine, we are left to ponder the best way to prevent harm to children and adult users. It will be interesting to see where the FDA comes down on the issue. In the meantime, those who use e-cigarettes do so without sufficient scientifically-based guidance.

Philosophers once theorized that well-being, wisdom, wonder and giving are essential -- but that perspective was lost somewhere along the way. Arianna Huffington, the president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post, is bringing these lessons back into focus.At Friday night's Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City, Arianna joined seasoned interviewer Paul Holdengräber as a part of the Onassis Cultural Center New York's Profiles series to discuss her latest book, Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder. In addition to addressing the components that make up what Arianna calls the ""third metric of life,"" the two friends dug deeply into the questions Greek philosophers once famously asked about what it means to lead a good life. Amid quoting famed Greek poetry and prose, and a few modern-day comedians, they discussed Arianna's life and work and the journey that led her here.""We all have that place of wisdom, strength and peace inside of us,"" she told Holdengräber.Arianna uses walking to help her connect with this inner place, considering it one of the most powerful ways to cure the ills incurred from living in a society that is constantly plugged in. ""There's something really powerful about being completely present, movement, and taking in nature,"" she said. ""And I think it's something we've lost.""Holdengräber pointed out that many New Yorkers walk a great deal, but they do so with smartphones in hand. According to Arianna, ""It's incredibly important for us to disconnect from technology in order to reconnect with ourselves."" It's not necessarily a challenging thing to do -- we just have to make a conscious choice to do it. This constant connection with technology wreaks havoc on current sleep habits, as well. Scientific evidence proves just how important sleep is in maintaining one's physical, mental and emotional health and well-being. And yet, society began glorifying sleep deprivation and burnout, making them a point of pride.""In modern times, we consider sleep a terrible necessity. We just crash and then wake up. We identify being busy with being important,"" Arianna said. ""We are now a culture drowning in data, drowning in information, starving for wisdom. Sleep is another kind of sacrifice to this endless quest for stimulation ... and in the process, we are damaging ourselves.""Arianna compared working 24/7 to coming to work drunk, because science shows that sleep deprivation affects the body in a similar way to alcohol intoxication. Luckily, some companies within corporate America have recently begun adjusting the work culture to to reflect the value of this truth.""People are now realizing they're not their jobs,"" she said, ""And people we admire are often people who did not let their jobs define them."" Thrive, which Arianna considers a form of homecoming, is dedicated to and celebrates the life of her mother, one of the people she admires most. She said her mother understood the importance of giving, experiencing life's moments with loved ones, valuing education and treating everyone like the human beings they are. She also despised multitasking.""In the end, I've learned everything from her, at first unconsciously and then gradually more and more consciously,"" Arianna said. ""My mother lived a Third Metric life before I knew what a Third Metric life was."" "

Her brother later pulled her body from the vehicle.Another service was held in nearby Darrington for retired librarian Linda McPherson, 69, who was found dead in the debris of her home.

The reason: Despite the plunge, they still look overvalued.Familiar names such as Netflix, Facebook and Tesla Motors, along with a number of biotechnology and cloud-computing stocks, have been pummeled in the last month. Some stocks are down more than 20 percent over that period, falling into their own bear market, and yet their valuations still far exceed those of the broader U.S. stock indexes. Wall Street defines a bear market as a drop of 20 percent or more from a recent peak.Facebook Inc, for example, has fallen nearly 22 percent from an intraday record reached less than a month ago. The stock was still up nearly 3.8 percent for the year at Friday's close. Among biotech names, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has declined 23 percent from a Feb. 25 intraday high, and yet the stock on Friday was still up 7 percent for the year.Facebook still traded on Friday at a price-to-sales ratio of nearly 20, making it the most expensive in the S&P 500, which has an overall price-to-sales ratio of 1.7. The other companies with expensive valuations read like a Who's Who of so-called momentum stocks, including Regeneron, Alexion, TripAdvisor and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.""There's value somewhere, but since these things aren't being traded off typical valuations, you can't go by those metrics, and it's more about when do you find that stability,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.The price-to-sales ratio is the way to value a stock by looking at its market capitalization in comparison to its sales over a 12-month period.The declines have come at a time when investors overall are seeing a general improvement in economic figures, including Friday's nonfarm payrolls data, which showed strong job gains in March and more people moving into the labor force.On Friday, the Nasdaq lost more than 100 points even though the S&P 500 briefly touched another intraday record. TEPID EARNINGS FORECASTExpectations for earnings have come down for the first quarter, but investors are hoping for an improved outlook for most of the S&P 500. That may cause the rotation away from hyper-growth to steady growth to continue.Earnings season begins next week with reports from Bed Bath & Beyond, Wells Fargo & Co and JPMorgan Chase & Co.First-quarter S&P 500 companies' earnings are projected to have increased just 1.2 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when growth was estimated at 6.5 percent.""I'm not concerned about this spilling over to the broader market. We've been in a trading range, finding resistance at record levels, so this isn't cause for alarm,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston, where he helps oversee $703 billion in assets under management.""I think there are bargains to be found, just not in the names that are getting hit. Financials are attractive here, as are industrials. The more mature tech names, especially on the software side, look valuable,"" he said.The interest in speculative plays hasn't entirely eroded. Four different companies made their debuts on U.S. exchanges on Friday, and all four ended their first day higher, with the most notable being online food delivery service GrubHub Inc, which shot up 31 percent.However, for those concerned that the selling in biotech, Internet retail and other trading-crowd favorites will spill over to the rest of the market, Friday was a bit worrisome. The S&P 500 gave up early gains to end the day down 1.25 percent.""If the weakness here cascades into other sectors, that would indicate a fundamental shift in the market. If things keep rolling over, you might want to seek protection or examine your fundamentals,"" said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio, which manages about $1.3 billion. OVERSUPPLYSince stocks like Netflix carry valuations far above most of the market, some investors are reluctant to buy them now.""For momentum stocks to work, you need people to believe they can go higher,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.O'Rourke pointed out that while many of these stocks are actually still up for 2014 on an absolute basis, buyers this year are underwater, based on the shares' volume-weighted average price (VWAP).The VWAP is a measure of the average cost of a stock for a particular period.Facebook, for instance, had gained 9 percent in 2014 as of Thursday's close. Going into Friday, investors who bought the stock this year were on average down 6 percent on a VWAP basis.""They bought at the wrong time, based upon where the shares are now,"" he said. ""This also means there is a high likelihood there will be overhead supply when the shares rally as investors seek to unwind the losing trades.""In the options market, investors used the opportunity to exercise some caution. Amazon.com attracted trading volume at more than two-and-a-half-times the recent daily average volume. The most active option contracts were put options expiring next week that protect against the stock falling below $320, suggesting some hedging against losses.Options trading volume for TripAdvisor surged to nearly three times the recent average. Put options outpaced calls, with 8,841 calls and 9,832 puts traded on Friday. (Wall St Week Ahead runs every Friday.

6,BUSINESS,9 CEOs With The Worst Reputations: 24/7 Wall St.,"24/7 Wall St., 24/7 Wall St.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/worst-ceos_us_5bb30ac3e4b0480ca662806c,"These are the nine CEOs with the worst reputations. Some CEOs, however, are not popular with employees. At nine major companies",2014-04-05,"FILE - In this Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2009, file photo, Michael S. Jeffries, chairman and CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch, speaks at the annual National Retail Federation conference in New York. When it comes to flying, it seems that Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Michael S. Jeffries is obsessed with the details. A 40-plus page manual that was filed with court documents in relation to an age discrimination suit by a former pilot outlined a list of instructions for crew members aboard the CEO's Gulfstream jet that stipulated everything from how to arrange the toilet paper to what type of cologne should be worn. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30ac32400003000973c6d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A good manager understands the contribution of his or her employees. In return, managers often receive the respect of their workers. And indeed, more than two-thirds of American employees approve — even like — their companies’ chief executive officers.Some CEOs, however, are not popular with employees. At nine major companies, 40% or fewer employees gave their CEOs a positive review. Sears Holdings’ CEO, Edward Lampert, received positive reviews from just 20% of Sears employees and from just 26% of Kmart employees, the lowest rated CEO. Based on 24/7 Wall St.’s independent review of employee ratings provided by Glassdoor, these nine CEOs have the worst reputations.According to Glassdoor spokesperson Scott Dobroski, “While this list was compiled by independent research by 24/7 Wall St., it’s clear that some CEOs may want to take note that their own employees feel they can improve when it comes to leadership.” 24/7 Wall St. identified a number of factors that can hurt a CEO’s reputation within his or her own company. These include a CEO’s propensity for humiliating the company in public, poor stewardship of the company and a compensation package that employees perceive to be excessive.Click here to see the nine CEOs with the worst reputationsA number of CEOs have failed to represent their companies adequately in public. On some occasions, a CEO’s public conduct was nothing more than a nuisance, while in other instances it became a liability for the company. Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Michael Jeffries is an infamous example of the latter. His comments about the retailer’s target audience — “cool, good-looking people” with “washboard stomachs” — have created negative feelings. Both the press and general public heaped scorn on Jeffries for his blatant lack of sensitivity and the company’s customer discrimination.Many of the CEOs with poor reputations also ran their companies poorly. Xerox CEO Ursula Burns has repeatedly claimed the company’s 2010 buyout of Affiliated Computer Services would rekindle Xerox’s years of flagging fortunes. Instead, Xerox’s services business has faltered and revenue flattened. The acquisition’s once-prized assets have barely turned out to be valuable at all. Less than one-third of Xerox employees gave Burns a positive review.One measure of stewardship is the evaluations employees gave their companies. Companies run by the CEOs on this list received scores of less than 3 out of 5 as an overall company rating, indicating workers were unhappy with their jobs and the companies. Employees of Sears Holdings’ Kmart stores gave their company just a 2.0 overall rating.Dobroski noted that the relationship between overall rating and CEO approval was not a surprise to him. “The same is conversely true for the top [rated CEOs]. CEOs with high approval ratings tend to lead companies with higher than average satisfaction ratings as well.” According to Dobroski, this is because “leadership and the tone for the company going forward is generally set at the top and then trickles down to the rest of the company.”Layoffs can also breed animosity toward management among employees. Since the beginning of 2013, GameStop has closed 500 stores. It is unlikely that company CEO J. Paul Raines is popular with current and former employees for that decision.Other cuts can have a similarly negative effect on employee morale. Last year, Forever 21, run by CEO and founder Do Won Chang, cut employee benefits and moved a number of workers from full-time to part-time status. The company denied this was intended to limit some employees from working more than 30 hours per week — which would have required the retailer to provide workers with health coverage as part of the Affordable Care Act.Continued store cuts at Sears Holdings, which are central to the company’s plans to streamline operations, may also create negative feelings toward management among workers.Extravagant pay can also lead employees to resent their CEOs. The three members of the Dillard family who run Dillard’s not only serve as management, but they also control the company’s board. The three brothers were paid a total of more than $58 million between 2011 and 2013. With a share price that has risen dramatically in recent years, from just a few dollars to nearly $100, investors may feel this money has been earned. It is unlikely that employees were as enthusiastic.The chief executives with the worst reputations may want to look at their more popular counterparts at other companies to determine how they can improve and win over their employees. According to Dobroski, well-liked executives focus on “clearly communicating their vision, including being transparent about where the company is going, how they’re going to get there, and how each employees plays a vital role in this.”However, for many executives there is little incentive to improve those perceptions without direct intervention from the stockholders. Despite the company’s weak financial performance, and his own rash statements, Abercrombie & Fitch’s Jeffries only stepped down as chairman of the board after hedge fund Engaged Capital launched a campaign to split the roles of CEO and chairman. Sears Holdings’ Lampert not only serves in both these roles, but he also engineered the 2005 merger of Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Kmart, widely considered to be a failure. Additionally, ESL Investments, Lampert’s investment fund, owned 48.5% of all shares outstanding as of March 19.In order to identify the CEOs with the worst reputations, 24/7 Wall St. examined employee reviews at Glassdoor. To be considered, companies had to have a minimum of 500 reviews. Of the more than 225 companies with more than 500 comments, 24/7 Wall St. identified the nine CEOs with the lowest favorable reviews — 40% or lower. Positive reviews of Eddie Lampert, CEO of Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart, were both below 40%. Reviews of Michael Jeffries, CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch and subsidiary Hollister, were also both below 40%. Data on average wages by position were also from Glassdoor. Additionally, we reviewed financial statements from these companies, where available, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

You know, Google's head-mounted smart device. Not that thing you drink water out of every single day.According to The Wall Street Journal, the company submitted an application last year for a trademark on the word, but was blocked by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Trademark examiners felt that a patent on ""Glass"" would be confusing for consumers, noting also that the word is ""merely descriptive"" rather than ""distinctive"" and, thus, does not deserve a trademark.But Google, which has already trademarked the term “Google Glass,"" isn't ready to give up. The company's trademark lawyers wrote a tome of a response letter and submitted it to the trademark office in September, per the Journal. As CNET points out, Google isn't the first tech company to try trademarking a generic term. Facebook attempted to get a patent on the word ""book"" and currently has trademarks on ""F,"" ""Face,"" ""FB,"" ""Wall"" and ""Facepile.""Google may also be having a difficult time getting people to jump on board with its bold device. Negative reactions to Google Glass seem to make headlines every other week. In January, a woman was given a ticket for driving with her device, another was assaulted in a bar over hers in February and several bars and restaurants in California have banned the device altogether. In response to all the bad press surrounding its much-hyped device, Google released a ""Google Glass Myths"" guide to shed some positive light on the technology. But even that effort was met with mixed reactions. "

(AP Photo/David Adame)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb37096210000e700c7ce5e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - Tech workers in Silicon Valley debated on Friday whether Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich got the comeuppance he deserved or was himself a victim of intolerance when he resigned under pressure this week amid outrage over his opposition to same-sex marriage.Some, especially a dating website that had urged its users to boycott Mozilla's popular Firefox web browser, cheered Eich's resignation after less than two weeks as CEO of the nonprofit software company. Others viewed him as a victim and called his critics intolerant of people with different views.Mozilla co-founder Eich, who invented the programming language Javascript, donated $1,000 in 2008 to support Proposition 8, which sought to ban same-sex marriage in California. Voters approved the measure, but it was struck down in U.S. federal court.Eich did not respond to requests for comment on Friday, but he had posted an apology on his blog before he resigned for the pain his stance had caused. His views about gay marriage had been known within Mozilla for nearly two years, but controversy erupted after he was appointed CEO in late March.Rarebit founders Hampton and Michael Catlin, a gay developer couple, pulled their software apps from Mozilla after Eich's appointment. OkCupid.com, the online dating site, called for a boycott of Firefox. Some on Twitter who identified themselves as Mozilla employees called for Eich to resign.On Friday, news of Eich's departure prompted a backlash on Twitter. Many suggested Silicon Valley was intolerant of people with views outside northern California's liberal mainstream.Even Rarebit's Hampton Catlin said he had not anticipated the issue's escalation and was saddened by Eich's resignation.""We absolutely believe people should be allowed to have personal opinions, but we also believe that we are allowed to disagree and to try and change someone's mind by expressing our own personal story,"" the Catlins said in a statement.""We absolutely don't believe that everyone who voted yes on Prop 8 is evil. In fact, we're sure that most of them just didn't understand the impact the law would have.""They said many backers changed their mind due to ""the impact and pain that the law caused to friends and family members.""When Eich made his $1,000 donation in opposition to same-sex marriage, the political landscape for gay rights was different than it is today. Even presidential candidate Barack Obama and his Democratic primary rival Hillary Clinton were five years away from embracing legalization of same-sex marriage.At the end of 2008, same-sex marriages were legal in only Massachusetts and Connecticut. Today 17 states, including California, allow such marriages.AN APOLOGYBefore his resignation, Eich posted an apology on his blog for the ""pain"" he said his views had caused. He vowed to uphold a culture of equality as Mozilla's CEO, including maintaining the nonprofit's health benefits for same-sex couples.In the Thursday post that announced his exit, Eich said he was taking a rest to spend more time with his family and would continue to work on browser software issues.Some cheered his resignation, including OkCupid.""We are pleased that OkCupid's boycott has brought tremendous awareness to the critical matter of equal rights for all partnerships,"" the company said on its main Twitter feed.Silicon Valley's denizens pride themselves on being part of a meritocratic community that welcomes talented workers regardless of their origins or political and religious beliefs.But analysts said the Eich episode showed there are limits to that tolerance.Gay rights are widely embraced in the San Francisco area, long known for its thriving lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Silicon Valley's tech culture reflects that sensitivity, and its companies rely on their CEOs to set that kind of tone, analysts said.""We in Silicon Valley have a certain degree of hero worship,"" said Jane English-Lueck, an anthropologist at San Jose State University who has studied the industry's culture.""The CEO has a lot of iconic visibility, and what a business leader is saying is going to have meaning to people about that company.""Eich's departure is a reminder that high-profile corporate executives can be taken to task for unpopular personal views, said Bruce Barry, professor of management and sociology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.""This might make other executives understand that you are potentially accountable for your private views,"" Barry said. ""The fear of getting in trouble or not advancing causes people to self-censor. But that's what rank-and-file employees have always known.""Mozilla has apologized for not addressing the controversy quickly enough and said it was wrestling with the conflict between ""equality and freedom of speech.""""Equality is necessary for meaningful speech,"" company chairwoman Mitchell Baker said in a blog post announcing Eich's resignation on Thursday. ""And you need free speech to fight for equality. Figuring out how to stand for both at the same time can be hard.""(Additional reporting and writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by David Lindsey and David Gregorio)(In April 4 story, corrects paragraph three to show Proposition 8 was struck down in U.S. federal court, not by U.S. Supreme Court)"

The film revolves largely on what role Courtney Love may have played in Cobain's death, with some alleging she instigated his murder. ""Kurt & Courtney"" opened to a bout of controversy. The documentary was set to premiere at Sundance but was removed from the lineup after Love threatened to sue the festival's organizers. With details about Cobain's death continuing to trickle out, it's a given that we'll never know exactly what happened in the leadup to the rocker's demise.

The first person in the family to wear No. 30 in a college basketball game, Kyles last played for the University of Texas at Arlington in 1985 and gave birth to Julius in 1994. Without the example Kyles set for her son in the years since, Kentucky might not have reached the 2014 Final Four. ""My mom is my everything,"" Randle told CBS for a moving segment about his rise to stardom that aired before the Elite Eight. ""I truly admire everything about her and to do that all by herself truly says something about the person she is."" Herself a basketball player, Kyles recognized signs of her son's talent years before Kentucky head coach John Calipari came calling. She nurtured it by not taking it easy on him on the court.""I would push him around. He'd fall down and hop up all mad. I'd throw hook shots on him, and it would just kill him,"" Kyles told Kyle Tucker of the Louisville Courier-Journal before the Sweet 16. ""I couldn't feel guilty, because this was the position I was in. I had to be both mother and father. I couldn't be weak. I had to be strong. I couldn't baby him. I had to make sure my kids were strong, show them how to get out there and fight for what they wanted. That's what they saw in me every day.""As opponents of Kentucky during the 2014 NCAA Tournament can attest, pushing around the 19-year-old freshman forward is no easy task these days. Standing 6' 9"" and tipping the scales at 250 pounds, Randle is as powerful a forward as can be found in the college ranks. He still hasn't gotten too big to recall how he used to get pushed around by his mom.   ""When I was younger, she used to be beat me in one on one,"" Randle told CBS. ""She kind of had a power game a little bit like me. She used to beat me up on the court.""STORY CONTINUES BELOWBefore heading off for Lexington, Randle attended Prestonwood Christian Academy about 30 miles from AT&T Stadium, the site of the 2014 Final Four. As a senior at Prestonwood, Randle averaged 32.5 points and 22.5 rebounds per game as he led his team to a state championship. A McDonald's All-American in 2013 who was projected to be one of the top selections in the 2014 NBA Draft before playing a game at Kentucky, Randle has lived up to his advanced billing. Kyles was in stands at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis as No. 8 Kentucky tipped off against No. 2 Michigan in the Elite Eight on Sunday afternoon but she was not there when the final buzzer sounded on the instant classic. Kyles had to leave the game during the second so that she could catch a flight back to Texas to ensure she at work on Monday morning.""If I'd called my manager and asked if I could have tomorrow off, they know what's going on,"" Kyles, who caught the thrilling conclusion to the game at the airport before her 7:50 p.m. flight, told the Lexington Herald-Leader. ""They would have said, yes. I'm not that type of person. I'm trying to keep my obligations.""Although it was another Kentucky freshman, Aaron Harrison, who drained the game-winning shot against Michigan, Randle played a large role in making sure that his mom would have another chance to see him play this season. He scored a team-high 16 points and grabbed a game-high 11 rebounds as the young Wildcats punched their own tickets to Texas with a 75-72 win.""I'm coming home to my mom,"" Randle told reporters the game.

No, this doesn't mean that Kentucky will stop recruiting talented high school players with NBA aspirations. It means that the Wildcats' polarizing coach wants everyone to stop using the pejorative ""one and done"" phrase to talk about young men with the talent and training to secure a job in the NBA after only a year in college. Holding court with the media at site of the 2014 Final Four, Calipari suggested ""succeed and proceed"" as a more apt replacement phrase. ""The connotation that's been built around one‑and‑done is so ridiculous to make it a bad thing,"" Calipari told reporters on Friday, a day before his eighth-seeded team faced off against No. 2 Wisconsin. ""It's a negative thing. It's not used in other sports, it's not used in other areas of life where people stay in school a year and leave. So the thing that we have been talking about is succeed and proceed. Succeed and proceed. You cannot proceed until you succeed. Succeed and then proceed. It will be on T shirts.""With five freshman in his starting lineup, Calipari is coaching the youngest team to reach the Final Four since Michigan's ""Fab Five"" in 1992. He also remains the face of the so-called one-and-done rule. The 55-year-old who won a national championship in 2012 with another Kentucky squad led by freshman stars used his ""bully pulpit"" at AT&T Stadium to expound on the problems with the NBA's current eligibility requirement as well as the way that the media and fans talk about players who leave for the professional ranks after a single season in school. ""It's not my rule. So then the columns are written. It's fine. If you want to pile it on and say it's me, I'm OK,"" Calipari said. ""All I care about is the players that I'm coaching, that they're prepared to reach their dreams, whether it's after one year, two years, three year, four year. I've had guys stay all those times. I think some of my suggestions would be good to cure some of this, at the very least we just got to do right by these kids.""In his forthcoming book ""Players First: Coaching From the Inside Out,"" Calipari fully laid out his feelings about the current NBA rule that keeps young players out until one year after their high-school graduation. Calipari explained what sets him apart from many other opponents of the current system in the following excerpt obtained by the Wall Street Journal. I've made it work for the teams I coach—and for the players—as best I can. But I don't like it one bit. Some people say I'm renting players or I'm working the system. Let me make this very clear: I want to coach players for four years. Very few of the young players are truly ready for the rigors of the NBA. All but a handful would benefit from more time playing college basketball, more class time and more time on a college campus."
