He, along with hundreds of civil rights demonstrators, fell victim to a mass showdown of police night sticks, dogs and tear gas during their march for voting rights.

From Iraqi women abducted and enslaved by ISIL to Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped and forced into marriage, these tragedies seem to belong to medieval times.Too often, women bear the burden of war. All of us have an obligation to do everything in our power to stop this abhorrent violence wherever and whenever it occurs. But this is only part of the story of women in the 21st Century.I'd like to propose a different headline, a different narrative. While their work may not always make the front pages, women are confronting our most pressing global issues. At great personal risk, they are fighting poverty, discrimination, and violence so that their families, communities, and countries can have better lives.As Secretary of State, I see the power of women every day in every country that I visit - from Afghanistan, where they are creating opportunities for the next generation, to Liberia, where President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is building the foundation of democracy. On Friday, the State Department honored 10 such women with the International Women of Courage Award. Our awardees represent only a small fraction of women around the world who work to advance peace, security, and gender equality, but their individual stories of bravery represent the positive impact that empowered women can make everywhere. In Kosovo, journalist Arbana Xharra wrote a series of investigative reports on religious extremists in her country. Her tireless efforts uncovered links to foreign terrorist organizations and helped us fight against the rise of a radical extremism threatening global peace and prosperity. Her example galvanized a new generation of journalists working in a nascent democracy to stand up to injustice and corruption.In Syria, the civil war and humanitarian crisis are destabilizing an entire region. Majd Chourbaji has devoted her life to defending human rights and advocating on behalf of detainees. When she was arrested and thrown in jail by the Asad regime for her advocacy work, she turned the tables by helping women in her prison fight for their own justice and due process. Her efforts led to the release of 83 women prisoners. Now living in Lebanon, she works through Women Now for Development centers to assist Syrian refugee women find economic and social stability by preparing them to participate in peace building efforts at the local and national level. And in Guinea, women like Marie Claire Tchecola are on the front lines of the fight against Ebola. As an emergency room nurse at Donka Hospital in Guinea's capital, Ms. Tchecola devoted herself to caring for Ebola patients despite the absence of basic protection like gloves. When she became infected, she took precautions to protect other workers and her family from contracting the disease - and when she recovered, she went back to work. Through her leadership in the Ebola Survivors Association of Guinea, she continues to spread awareness about the disease and fight the stigma associated with its survivors. These three women faced unique circumstances and barriers in different parts of the world. But each of them - as well as the other recipients from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burma, Central African Republic, Japan, and Pakistan - found a way to stand tall and strong, to become agents of change. Tapping the power and potential of women is essential to addressing the global challenges we face. The proof is out there. When women and girls have access to education, health care and jobs, their families and communities are more productive and stable. The opposite is true, too: When women are excluded and victimized, societies suffer grievously.So we will not retreat in the face of those who seek to diminish or banish women and girls to the margins of society. We do not accept rape as a byproduct of conflict. We will not accept the early and forced marriage of girls as a social norm. And we will not forget those who have been or are being held against their will. Instead, we honor them for the courage they show in the face of brutality and intimidation.On this International Women's Day - and every day - we have a responsibility to stand united and work together in the ongoing struggle for the rights of women and girls worldwide so that they may live full, healthy, and productive lives."

4,WOMEN,Where We Have Been and What We Can Become - Celebrating International Women's Day,"Beata Pozniak, ContributorActress, Artist and Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/where-we-have-been-and-wh_b_6814068.html,"The idea for International Women's Day was born at a conference in Copenhagen in 1910.

It is a time to reflect on progress made, to call for change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of women's rights.As a young girl growing up in Poland, I vividly recall newscasts chronicling the amazing events on International Women's Day that took place all over Europe. It was inspiring for me to see examples of historic achievements by women as they struggled for equality and justice at all levels of society. Later on, when I left the communist system of Poland and came to America, I was surprised to discover how little awareness there was in this country of International Women's Day as a powerful symbol of women's history. To commemorate this special day I made a painting inspired by Mnemosyne, the Mother of Memory, that explores where we have been and what we can become. It is a symbol of International Women's Day depicting a community of all races of the world in a female form. It evokes the achievements of women through their struggle for peace and equality in the face of discrimination and war. In the late 1980's I dedicated myself to making International Women's Day an official day of celebration in the United States. I was able to convince then Mayor Tom Bradley to proclaim it an official day of celebration in Los Angeles and Governor Pete Wilson soon did the same for the State of California. I eventually enrolled Congresswoman Maxine Waters as an ally in my quest. This led directly in 1994 to Congresswoman Waters' introduction into the U.S. Congress of H.J.R 316. It was the first bill in the history of the US Congress for political recognition of International Women's Day as an official day of celebration in the United States. Since that time, it has been an enormous source of satisfaction for me to see the growth of interest within the U.S. in this tremendously significant celebration. Today it is easy to forget that less than one hundred years ago women around the world were not allowed to join a union, to get a college degree or to hold a library card. At that time the right to vote was still a distant dream for most women. While New Zealand was the first country ever to give women the right to vote in 1893, most countries did not recognize the political voice of a woman until decades later: Holland in 1917, Great Britain in 1918, France in 1944, Italy and Japan in 1945, and Switzerland not until 1971. In the United States, universal women's suffrage didn't become law until 1920. This day honors the important work of women as pioneers in political activism, in social reforms, in the arts, and in their communities. It is a day to celebrate ordinary women doing extraordinary work, and offers us a chance to pay homage to these women who are creating a better world for all of us. We also mark this day to reexamine contemporary mainstream media accounts of male-dominated governments and corporations. International Women's Day reminds us that women have fought for, and won, better educational opportunities and have also secured legislation to ensure control of our earnings, property, employment rights, and suffrage. While there have been many victories for women's rights over the past century, there is still much to be done. Women are still denied equal pay for equal work and are still underrepresented in government and industry. They are still struggling to control their reproductive destinies, and in many cultures are still regarded as chattel property. In a world where domestic violence is still pervasive, we are reminded that this day must not only be about celebration, but also about awareness and education. For everyone, men and women alike, awareness and education are the keys to ending violence against women and ensuring equal rights and opportunities.The idea for International Women's Day was born at a conference in Copenhagen in 1910. It sought to raise international awareness of the connection between all women and to bring attention to the cultural, social, and economic diversity of our lives. Now it has grown into a truly international celebration that gives voice to the remarkable women who have come before us and who paved the way for the future achievements of our daughters and granddaughters. This day, March 8th, honors all that we have been, all that we are, and all that we will become.Happy International Women's Day!"

While the mounting evidence seems to point to a resounding ""no,"" maybe this is the wrong question to be asking.What if, at the end of the day, it's a much simpler problem?A spotlight has been focused on the much vilified ""conservative"" House caucus (quote marks around ""conservative"" because you can't call for government shutdowns and legislation through extortion and be a true conservative). These legislators, formerly known as Tea Partyers and now the very marrow of the GOP in Congress, have won the umbrage of not only Democrats, as expected, but also of other, perhaps more moderate Republicans who have blamed them for gumming up the legislative process in the name of ideological purity, creating one of the most unproductive Congresses since, well, the last Congress.It's fair to state that thus far, the Republican majority in Congress is as ineffective as the Republican minority was.Republicans with an intent to govern have focused their ire on this group of politicians, blaming them for chronic dysfunction. I don't think that this conclusion is accurate.While the job of Speaker of the House is, and has always been, both an exercise in raw power and cat-herding, it's clear that after five years of John Boehner's (R-Ohio) Speakership, there is a different dynamic at play than in the past.Yes, GOP moderates may take comfort in blaming the radicals, but ultimately the awesome institutional power of the Speakership is practically unassailable. The list of iron-rod-wielding speakers is long. And the will of the Speaker combined with strategic and generous rewards and punishments have kept the unruly House functioning, a full partner with the Senate and the White House in the messy process of ruling a sprawling continental nation and its even more complex global empire.But just as the Roman Senate fell into chaos because of weak leadership, causing a series of institutional deep wounds and eventual collapse into dictatorship, Boehner's House of Representatives resembles more a broken legislature than one worthy of the world's preeminent power.As I read history, I'm struck by one dominant quality shared by all successful Speakers: an iron will to rule the House. While we in America shy away from any suggestion that our magistrates and legislators are very powerful, instead hiding their true power behind a rhetorical curtain of ""people's representative"" and the like, the reality is that our Constitution was written to give the United States a strong government able to overcome the systemic weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation and the chaos provoked by their diffusion of power in America's first experiment with republicanism.There are very few figures in the American political system, such as the president and the Speaker of the House, who are endowed with clear, unambiguous and awesome power as to be true national leaders. The Speaker of the House, under both parties, has traditionally been a man or woman who could whip and motivate the troops behind a singular vision of purpose -- a figure who provoked equal parts fear and awe, if not always love.It's very hard to imagine a successful Reagan presidency without the equally successful tenure of Speaker Tip O'Neill (D-Mass.). Would President Reagan have been able to advance his sweeping political program if Speaker O'Neill had permitted his left flank to exercise its collective id against a president who, at least ideologically, they despised? The answer is ""no."" The Reagan Revolution would have been suffocated if O'Neill had not controlled the ardent left, sublimated their emotions and forced the House to function as a true representative of the national will and interests.It's impossible to ignore that Boehner is no Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) or House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), either. As does Boehner, both of these more recent Speakers had to deal with enormous issues of national importance, highly polarizing presidents and vocal minorities within their own parties that would rather see the president fail than the country succeed.Imperfectly and always messy, Gingrich and Pelosi nevertheless managed to use their power to simultaneously advance their party's agenda while allowing the government to function, to govern and serve the national interest.Maybe it's time to face reality. While the right wing of the House GOP clearly has an anti-Obama agenda that overwhelms their pro-America rhetoric in its practice, they have been unusually empowered by a Speaker who capitulates to this caucus's most puerile, un-strategic instincts on an ongoing basis. Boehner has allowed his power to flow away, like water flowing down a mountain, without any resistance.There is no better insight into Boehner's view of ""leadership"" than when he revealed his concept of being the man in charge: ""If you say, 'Follow me,' and no one does, you're not leading -- you're just taking a walk."" This is just a bizarre, anti-leadership philosophy that by definition describes his failure as Speaker.No great historical leader has succeeded by putting themselves at the mercy of those whom they seek to lead. Rather, by power of mind, raw will and a vision of where to lead, successful leaders make their followers want to fight another battle, cross an ocean or step on the moon.Leaders are born, not made, so the saying goes. Certainly in any good study of historical heroes, you see this theme repeated over and over. Boehner surely has great qualities as a human being. But as leader, he has only demonstrated a keen capacity to perpetuate himself in his regal office in the Capitol -- at the significant expense of wrecking the House of Representatives and failing America."

He has since implemented a harsh crackdown on Islamists as well as secular political opponents.Egyptian courts have sentenced hundreds of alleged Brotherhood supporters to death in recent months, many in mass trials condemned by foreign governments and rights groups as violating international law.Saturday's execution came a month after Egypt's high court upheld the death sentence against Ramadan. Most of the other death sentences are still under review in a complex system of legal appeals.In one of the most dramatic scenes of the upheaval following Mursi's fall captured on video, Ramadan threw someone off a rooftop during clashes in the northern Mediterranean city's Sidi Gaber district. An al Qaeda flag was seen tucked into the back of Ramadan's trousers.Fifty-seven others were sentenced to 15-25 years in the case.The Brotherhood, which says it is committed to peaceful activism, has accused the military of staging a coup and curbing freedoms won in the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak.(Reporting by Omar Fahmy and Stephen Kalin; Editing by Catherine Evans)"

Key to the passage of the Voting Rights Act, were the highly visible marches across the Edmund Winston Pettus Bridge in Selma, organized by Dr. Martin Luther King, John Lewis and other esteemed leaders. Lewis will be leading us this weekend. In 1965, while crossing the bridge he was beaten so badly that his skull was fractured. On the third march across the bridge, the interfaith, multi-racial crowd was finally able to travel the distance from Selma to the Alabama state capital, Montgomery, to demand the right to register to vote. All these efforts encouraged Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson to make the Voting Rights Act the law of the land. Marching with Congressman John Lewis and Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes-Norton during the Civil Rights Pilgrimage in 2014.  Unfortunately, the fight for voting rights is not over. Many states around the country, including Alabama, have recently moved to make it harder for Americans to cast their votes in elections by requiring photo identification and restricting early voting periods. Their actions have disproportionately impacted lower income Americans, people of color, and senior citizens. To make matters worse, in 2013, the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder gutted many of the protections in the Voting Rights Act that have done so much good for so long.  It is my hope that today's pilgrimage in Selma will be a pivotal national moment that will once again lead to the passage of the bipartisan Voting Rights Act, which will overturn and prevent measures to limit the franchise. We can best honor those who marched 50 years ago by reconfirming in law the American principle that all people truly have the right to vote."

A week ago the militants released a video showing them smashing statues and carvings in the city's museum, home to priceless Assyrian and Hellenistic artifacts dating back 3,000 years.On Thursday they attacked the remains of the Assyrian city of Nimrud, south of Mosul, with bulldozers. The United Nations cultural agency UNESCO condemned the actions as ""cultural cleansing"" and said they amounted to war crimes.Hatra dates back 2,000 years to the Seleucid empire which controlled a large part of the ancient world conquered by Alexander the Great. It is famous for its striking pillared temple at the center of a sprawling archaeological site.Saeed Mamuzini, spokesman for the Mosul branch of the Kurdish Democratic Party, said the militants had used explosives to blow up buildings at Hatra and were also bulldozing it.The antiquities ministry said the lack of tough international response to earlier Islamic State attacks on Iraq's historic sites had encouraged the group to continue its campaign.""The delay in international support for Iraq has encouraged terrorists to commit another crime of stealing and demolishing the remains of the city of Hatra,"" it said in a statement.Archaeologists have compared the assault on Iraq's cultural history to the Taliban's destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas in 2001. But the damage wreaked by Islamic State, not just on ancient monuments but also on rival Muslim places of worship, has been swift, relentless and more wide-ranging.Last week's video showed them toppling statues and carvings from plinths in the Mosul museum and smashing them with sledge hammers and drills. It also showed damage to a huge statue of a bull at the Nergal Gate into the city of Nineveh.Islamic State, which rules a self-declared caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria, promotes a fiercely purist interpretation of Sunni Islam which draws its inspiration from early Islamic history. It rejects religious shrines of any sort and condemns Iraq's majority Shi'ite Muslims as heretics.Last July it destroyed the tomb of the prophet Jonah in Mosul. It has also attacked Shi'ite places of worship and last year gave Mosul's Christians an ultimatum to convert to Islam, pay a religious levy or face death by the sword. It has also targeted the Yazidi minority in the Sinjar mountains west of Mosul. (Writing by Dominic Evans; Editing by Pravin Char and Stephen Powell)"

When we feel happy, we are more likely to get out and engage with the world -- and the more we do, the happier we become. Unfortunately, many of the things that can make us happier require a long-term commitment. Getting in shape takes time. Learning to meditate, while valuable, requires patience and self-control. Following someone's advice to ""just get out there and make friends"" sounds easy, but, it really isn't. So, if you feel like you're not reaching your happiness potential, it's hard to know where to start. Fortunately, there are several simple ways to boost your positivity in under a minute. None of these suggestions will change your life. But, in combination, they may be enough to get you started on the road to happiness. 1. Open Your BlindsYou've probably heard about SAD (seasonal affective disorder), in which a lack of sunlight can lead to sadness, or even depression. But, even if you don't suffer from this condition, opening up your blinds and letter a little sunshine into your home can give you a happiness boost. Even better, why not go for a quick walk in your garden? The extra sun will get your brain buzzing while the walk gets your heart pumping. 2. Put a Genuine Smile on Your FaceIt's true that smiling can give you a happiness boost, but, this is only part of the story. Have you ever noticed that genuine smiles look different than forced smiles? Your brain knows the difference too! So, instead of forcing yourself to put a smile on your face, think about what it feels like when you are happy. Conjure up a happy memory and watch your smile grow. You will feel the difference. 3. Eat a Piece of Dark ChocolateChocolate is not just a sinful little treat -- it can also make you happier! Chocolate contains chemicals called polyphenols, which have been shown to have happiness boosting properties. Just make sure that you choose dark chocolate (over 70 percent cacao) to get the benefits of chocolate without the downsides.4. Breathe ConsciouslyOne of the most effective ways to boost your happiness is also one of the simplest -- breathing. In a world filled with buzzing phones and blinking instant message screens, sometimes we need to return to the basics. Controlled breathing can lower your blood pressure and put your body and mind in a state of calm and relaxation. Find out more about the connection between breathing and happiness. 5. Practice GratitudeFor most people, negative thinking comes naturally. Positivity, on the other hand, requires conscious effort. One of the simplest ways that you can train your mind to focus on the positive is to write down what you are grateful for. So, take a minute right now and write down three things that make you happy. 6. Get Up and Move RegularlyAccording to Dr. James Levine, ""Sitting is the new smoking."" In a recent interview with the LA Times, he also said that low activity lifestyles have been linked with weight gain, diabetes and other health problems. In a perfect world, everyone would go to the gym five times a week and eat perfectly balanced diets. But, even getting up once an hour, stretching and walking around the house is a great start. If you're serious about your health and happiness, why not set an alarm to remind yourself to get moving every hour? 7. Do Something Good for OthersDoing good for other people is a simple way to increase your happiness. You don't even need to donate money to charity or join a cause that you care about (although you probably should!). Even giving a genuine complement to a friend or helping an elderly neighbor to collect her shopping is enough to make you feel more positive. What other activities have you found give you an instant happiness boost? Do you watch funny movies, listen to your favorite song or call a friend? I'd love to hear what works for you.

Many of our encounters with God inform our theology, make us who we are, and shape our living. I position my writings to reflect this part of my life that I try to live out as faithfully as I can.  In similar ways, religious artists try to capture some of the biblical and theological stories that live in their hearts, minds, and souls and recreate them in different art media. Religious art expresses theological journeys, struggles, and reflections on who God is and who we are. It brings beauty and wonder to the world as artists create representations or imaginings of the divine and the divine's interactions with creation. Through art we gain a deeper understanding of life, God, and the world. One religious artist who tries to capture provocative theological images in art is Caroline Mackenzie.  Caroline Mackenzie grew up in rural Norfolk, England and at fifteen decided to become an artist. At that age, she had no critical sense that there was any problem with the fact that the art books in the school library had no examples of women artists. She saw that being the artist was normally a white male enterprise with women playing the role of the beautiful, inspiring muse, or model. This led her to explore feminism, spirituality, and religion. She tried church but found no connections with her pressing questions. Then, at the British Museum, she discovered Indian sculpture. She found an art world that had meaning beyond entertainment and she also found some resemblance with her own body.   After graduating, Mackenzie went to India. It was a profound learning experience to be in a place where religion and devotion formed an integral part of everyday life. She stayed at INSCAPE Art Ashram, a small Christian community established by Jyoti and Jane Sahi. Here she had her first meaningful introduction to prayer. Her life in India formed her theological underpinnings that has influenced her art ever since.   In 1988, she returned to the UK and worked on a series of church commissions that culminated in a three year project at St Helen's Catholic Church, Caerphilly where she created wood carvings and made designs for the altar frontal and tabernacle setting. This project released tremendous energy and gave her a feeling for what it is like to engage and form public culture. This is the platform or area from which women have been excluded. How many churches or chapels have been designed by women? The church commissions provided her with public work while her inner psychological explorations found expression in paintings that she exhibited in art galleries.   In her attempt to integrate the inner and outer aspects of her life, Mackenzie became increasingly interested in feminist theology. In her continuing search for integration and wholeness, she turned to working in bronze as this medium enabled her to forge closer links between her inner and outer worlds. This fusion is authentic in her search for expression, empowerment, and integration as a Christian.   She is now working at the interface of the sacred and the secular as it has developed in Europe. Christian images of women often look disembodied, disempowered and a-sexual, whilst in the secular tradition, the female has a real body, but the image focuses on its erotic qualities. In neither context do images of women express active, creative, and empowered subjects with rights and dignity. Therefore, Mackenzie draws on the iconography of divine women in Indian religious art. Integrating her insights with the Christian tradition, she expands the idea of the sacred to include the full humanity of woman as included and playing an important part in Christ's redemptive humanity.  Mackenzie creates a form of art based on Christ's life that both women and men can identify with. A working relationship between feminist theologians and artists is productive. Artists can develop images and symbols that bring insights from the theologians into the wider public domain and theologians can help both scholars and lay people to understand this art and how it relates to scripture, tradition and the contemporary context.  Below are four bronze sculptures that represent theological reflection on Mackenzie's feminist faith development. These sculptures go back to the idea of art as a sadhana or spiritual practice as she understood it in India. The first sculpture is entitled, ""The Victim"". At first glance, it is difficult to discern the shape or form of the sculpture. On closer inspection it is a figure of a woman holding herself in a crouching state. She is vulnerable, weak, fatigued, and shamed. It is a state in which many women find themselves. Either they are shamed by society or victimized sexually, verbally, or physically. This state of mind, body, and soul, may become a tragic state of catatonia. The second sculpture is ""The Crucified Woman"". In our Christian faith and art, we have many male images, most notably Christ, of crucifixion. But we need to keep in mind, that women and girls are symbolically crucified in many ways all over the world. They suffer under patriarchy and sexism. Women are raped, molested, and violently attacked. Women's crucifixions often go unnoticed within a patriarchal Christianity that genders God as male. The third sculpture is ""The Creator"". Women have been creating, recreating, and giving birth since the beginning of time. Mackenzie emphasizes Proverbs 8:30, ""I was beside him as a master craftsman and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him."" The creative, creating feminine image of wisdom and Sophia needs to be retrieved within our Christian faith. We need to recognize the healing power in creating and being creators. Liberation and hope spring forth from creating.The fourth is called, ""The Flourishing Woman"". This sculpture has leaves that grow forth from the woman; these leaves are also flames. This symbolizes the woman like a tree planted beside the flowing waters. Psalm 1:3 speaks of such a tree that flourishes in good times and bad because the roots are near the water: ""Blessed is anyone who rejects the advice of the wicked and does not take a stand in the path that sinners tread, nor a seat in the company of cynics, but who delights in the law of Yahweh and murmurs his law day and night. Such a one is like a tree planted near streams; it bears fruit in due season and its leaves never wither, and every project succeeds."" The leaves are like the flames of Pentecost through which the Holy Spirit gives life, energy, power and hope to the people. Women, who are traditionally wounded, crucified and exiled, are given hope as they are reminded that they can flourish and bring forth creation.Together, these four sculptures express hope and transformation for women in the church. Women who are marginalized, subordinated, and victimized, can find power and empowerment in God. The good news can transform women into living, creating and powerful beings. Thanks be to God for artists who, by God's grace, proclaim this good news."

17,POLITICS,The Other FCC Decision,"David Morris, ContributorDirector, The Public Good Initiative, Institute for Local Self...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-other-fcc-decision_b_6808364.html,"By now, if the telecom companies had kept their promises we might well have a national broadband network that would be the envy of the world. Instead many consider the United States a laggard in high speed, affordable broadband.",2015-03-06,2015-03-05-1425569293-2480921-statesrightsvs.localauthority3.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-05-1425569293-2480921-statesrightsvs.localauthority3-thumb.jpg,"On February 28th the Federal Communications Commission issued two decisions. One concerned net neutrality, the other municipal broadband. The first garnered by far the most attention, as it should. Net neutrality affects everyone and locks down a fundamental principle for Internet access.But as another presidential campaign looms, the FCC decision on municipally owned broadband may offer more fertile ground for a vigorous political debate on the role of government and the scale of governance.The decision arose from a petition to the FCC by Chattanooga, Tennessee and Wilson, North Carolina asking it to overturn state laws that prevent them from extending their highly successful publicly owned networks to surrounding communities eager to connect. The FCC's decision affects just those two states' laws but will undoubtedly become a precedent to evaluate most of the other 17 states' restrictions on municipal broadband.Republicans grumbled at the net neutrality decision but they positively shrieked their dismay when the FCC ruled in favor of local authority. Within hours of the vote Republicans introduced a bill stripping the FCC of its authority to do so. A year ago Republicans tacked on an amendment to another bill that would have prevented the FCC from even taking up the issue. That amendment passed the House. Republicans voted 221-4 in favor. It died in the Senate.The Economic Argument: Protecting Shareholders and TaxpayersRepublicans marshal both economic and political arguments in their case against public networks. The economic argument is simply put: By pre-empting local authority Republicans are protecting shareholders from unfair competition and taxpayers from unwise investments by local governments.That municipal telecommunications networks have unfair advantages is a well-worn trope of telecom giants and Republicans. On the face of it, the proposition is preposterous. Does anyone truly believe that Salisbury, North Carolina whose public network at the time North Carolina passed its law had only 1,000 customers and whose municipal budget was only $34 million could have a competitive advantage over Time Warner, with 14 million customers and annual revenues of $18 billion? The compensation Time Warner paid its CEO Jeffrey Bewkes for 2013 exceeded the cost of Salisbury building its entire network.Preposterous or not, Republicans and telecoms are sticking with the argument. Indeed North Carolina legislators unblushingly titled their bill the Level Playing Field/Local Gov't Competition Act.In this debate about unfair competition, private telecoms would like us to forget about the enormous subsidies gifted to them in the past. In 1991 Vice President Al Gore called for building an Information superhighway by replacing old copper wires with fibers. Telephone companies enthusiastically applauded the Vice President's vision and rushed to request permission of state regulatory commissions to boost prices and increase profits in order to generate the capital needed to rewire the country. Most promised to achieve the rewiring within 20 years. Bruce Kushnick in his Book of Broken Promises notes that in its 1993 Annual Report to the New York Public Service Commission NYNEX vowed, ""We're prepared to install between 1.2 million and 2 million fiber optics lines by 1996..."" New Jersey Bell promised to rewire about 56 million miles by 2015.State legislatures and regulatory commissions almost uniformly acquiesced, agreeing, in effect, to tax phone (and later cable) customers to finance a new privately built and owned state of the art telecommunications network. Kushnick persuasively argues that by 2014 Americans were collectively charged about $400 billion by Verizon, AT&T and CenturyLink. In the mid 1990s cable companies pushed their snouts into the public trough with an agreement called the Social Contract. Kushnick estimates that from 1996 to 2014 cable customers paid about $61 billion extra.By now, if the telecom companies had kept their promises we might well have a national broadband network that would be the envy of the world. Instead many consider the United States a laggard in high speed, affordable broadband.Yet without a hint of shame, in comments to the FCC before its decision AT&T proposed that private companies should continue to receive preferential treatment ""to induce them to expand broadband deployment to unserved areas."" ""You almost have to admire AT&T's chutzpah in saying that, given the concessions they wrung out of communities over the years for promised AT&T broadband deployments that never even materialized,"" Lauren Weinstein, a veteran technology policy expert told MotherBoard.Ironically and inconsistently, at the same time telecom companies and Republicans insist that munis have an unfair competitive advantage, they just as vigorously insist that munis can't compete, that they fail in large numbers and local taxpayers pay the price.According to Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), ""After witnessing how some local governments wasted taxpayer dollars and accumulated millions in debt through poor decision making, the legislatures of states like North Carolina and Tennessee passed commonsense, bipartisan laws that protect hardworking taxpayers and maintain the fairness of free-market competition.""Free market competition? As my colleague at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) Chris Mitchell observed a year after North Carolina stalled municipal network expansion, ""The Federal Communications Commission ranks North Carolina last in the nation in percentage of households subscribing to at least a 'basic broadband' service, largely because Time Warner Cable, CenturyLink, and AT&T have declined to upgrade their networks to modern standards."" Nationwide the Washington Post reports, ""More than half of Americans have only one choice of Internet provider at speeds of 25 megabits per second, the basic threshold for high-speed internet under a new definition approved by the FCC last month.""The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of municipal broadband networks have been successful. The economic benefits of munis have been amply catalogued by ILSR's Community Broadband Initiative. They've saved host communities hundreds of millions of dollars, created tens of thousands of jobs, and become a firm foundation for future economic development efforts.Senator Tillis surely knows that North Carolina passed its bill only after several city networks had proven so successful that a growing number of other cities were seriously exploring the option. According to data gathered by the Center for Public Integrity the price of broadband delivered by the nine municipal networks in Tennessee have proven highly competitive.Some municipal networks have failed, although overall the mismanagement of public enterprises may pale into insignificance compared to the massive mismanagement of dozens of now bankrupt private telecom companies that lost investors tens of billions of dollars. And if munis cannot pay their debts bond investors, not taxpayers, shoulder the loss.In any event, Republican state legislators rarely act to protect taxpayers from unwise investments by local government, unless those investments might generate effective competition with the private sector. No state restricting municipally owned broadband also restricts a city from going deeply into debt to build a sports stadium (many of which are actually financed directly by taxpayer dollars). To my knowledge no state that requires a city to hold a referendum before it can build a broadband network also requires it to hold a referendum before selling it.The Political Argument: States RightsLast April, speaking before the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler responded to the Republicans' economic arguments, ""I understand that the experience with community broadband is mixed, that there have been both successes and failures. But if municipal governments want to pursue it, they shouldn't be inhibited by state laws that have been adopted at the behest of incumbent providers looking to limit competition.""Which leads to the Republicans key political argument: states rights. Before the FCC decision the principal sponsor of North Carolina law, State Rep. Marilyn Avila (R-Wake) asserted, ""We've gone beyond the question of municipal broadband right or wrong. It's now a question of state sovereignty.""In other words, state legislatures may be wrong to deny communities the right to build their own broadband networks but the federal government has no right to interfere. Republicans may well win the legal argument since the U.S. Constitution doesn't give municipalities any rights but they will find it challenging to win the political argument with the proposition that democracy should extend only to state capitols and no further. Few can deny that the debates that have taken place in hundreds of communities about whether to build a municipal network have been some of the most vigorous, transparent and democratic of all policy debates. In many cases citizens have voted on the question directly in referenda, rather than indirectly through their elected representatives.Republicans argue the federal government shouldn't intervene because Washington is too remote from the realities and needs of states and too unaccountable to that states' voters. But state capitols are similarly remote from the realities and needs of communities within their states and equally less accountable to them.In an ideal world, if the affected states were unwilling to abide by the FCC decision they would not go to court. They would go directly to their citizens via statewide referenda and ask them what they think. Is that too much to ask those who proclaim their love of democracy?"

He worries that ""our foreign policy has a lot of influence now from Muslims."" In particular, Graham views the Obama administration’s less than enthusiastic reception of Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech before congress as proof that Islam is exerting perilous influence on American foreign policy--apparently preferring to have perilous influence exerted on American foreign policy by someone more Christian, like Bibi Netan … wait. Graham sees this profligate tolerance of Islam as both telling and ominous: “They hate Israel and they hate Christians, and so the storm is coming.”Inasmuch as President Obama has been more than clear about his Christian commitments, continuing to question his faith is merely a more socially acceptable way of calling him a liar. Setting aside Franklin Graham’s storied parentage, a case could fairly easily be made, drawing from his penchant for spewing hatred, that a more devastating argument about Christian commitments could be leveled against Graham himself. But I’ll refrain from judging Franklin Graham’s status as a Christian, and just say that I don’t think much of his Christianity.But that’s Franklin Graham. His vituperous outbursts and questioning of President Obama’s faith are nothing new.But here’s the real question as far as I’m concerned: So what? Even if Franklin Graham were right, what exactly would be the problem with Muslims having greater access to the White House?Unless somebody hijacked the Constitution or the Golden Rule when I wasn’t paying attention, it is neither illegal nor immoral to be a practitioner of Islam. So, why in the fever-swamps over which Franklin Graham exercises influence is the chimera of Muslims running amok on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue such a vexing preoccupation?The only thing I can think that even remotely justifies Franklin’s parochial view of our Muslim sisters and brothers is the mistaken belief that we live in something called a “Christian nation.” But take it from a Christian, the United States of America is not a Christian nation. It never was, and God help us if it ever should be. The overheated fantasy of a Christian nation troubles me on a couple of different levels.For one thing, what I find most mystifying is that many of the same Christians who insist that Jesus never sanctioned government assistance when it comes to poverty or healthcare (because the government is largely a seedy institution bent on confiscating people’s money and wasting it) are simultaneously convinced that government wouldn’t be so bad if Christians were running the show. “Government is not the solution to our problem, government IS the problem,” Ronald Reagan famously intoned, which many popular conservative versions of Christianity enthusiastically applaud. But these same Christian enthusiasts seem to want to qualify Reagan’s denunciation of government by tacking onto the end, ” … unless Christians are in charge of it.” Government, in other words, is inherently bad--except when it’s not. Except when we’re in charge. Then we can finally fulfill America’s divine charge (are there people who still actually believe this?) to be a “city on a hill.”But you don’t get to have it both ways. You don’t get to say that government is inherently flawed, the cause of all the world’s problems when somebody else is in charge. And then turn around and insist that Christians have some kind of divine/historical claim to being in charge … because then, apparently, government would be an obvious gift to the world, healing everything from the nation’s morally ravaged soul to its tortured relationship to Justin Bieber.Let’s be honest, though. What kind of people believe that turning over the government to anybody who takes Franklin Graham seriously would be a good idea? I mean, even God has a tough enough time living down Franklin Graham’s narrow bigotry. So why would we ever want to put that same eye-rolling obligation on America?For another thing, I’m troubled by the assertion that greater access by Muslims to the levers of power is a bad thing. What’s the problem with Muslims? The Muslims I know are wonderfully thoughtful, respectful, and peaceful people.Unfortunately, Franklin doesn’t qualify his paranoia with unwieldy nuance. To his way of thinking, a Muslim is a Muslim is a Muslim. He seems to labor under the paranoid delusion that all Muslims are dangerously subversive suicide-bombers-in-waiting tout court. But that’s a terribly unfair brush with which to paint all Muslims. Lord knows I’m mortified by the thought that Muslims think all Christians are like Franklin Graham."

Some we get right away, others need some time to marinate in our minds before we fully process the gift of that moment. And even if those moments are super challenging, they should be looked at as gifts. Life happens for us, not to us and if we can grasp that concept, how much more empowered would we be moving forward in life?I've had many wins and challenges throughout my journey, both personally and professionally, that I know most people can relate to. I know this because even though we may have problems that look and feel totally different, we are all wired the same, wanting love, acceptance, and fulfillment in our lives. We all fear that we are not enough, and if that is the case, we won't be loved. But through an understanding of our experiences, we can come to the realization that these fears simply aren't true and that we have so much power within to create a life we want and deserve. Here are my top 10 greatest lessons I have learned along my path of pursuing my purpose, which may give some insight as to how you want to move forward pursuing your life's purpose.Lesson 1: The quality of your life is in direct correlation with how you manage your emotional state. Life is going to present its ups and downs to you. You are going to have good days where you rock it out, and you are going to have not-so-good days where you feel like crawling back in bed. What matters most through these ebbs and flows is how you manage your emotional state and what decisions you make as to how you see situations presented to you. Will you give up your power and become the victim or will you rise up and learn the lesson? Manage your emotional state, change the meaning to things that happen for you in your life, and you change the game!Lesson 2: When you take responsibility for what you think, say, feel, and do, you create empowerment. If everyone was on the same wave length as you, then things would be easy! We wouldn't have as much conflict if we were all on the same page. But the truth of the matter is, we all have different opinions and ways of seeing things and this is the beauty of life. It also can create an internal conflict when we feel so strongly about something and others see things so much differently. When we remind ourselves that the only thing that we can control in life is what we think, say, feel, and do and that's it; it creates so much more power than leaving it up to the opinions and actions of other people. We can't control situations and circumstances, but we can control what energy we allow into our life, and that is true power.Lesson 3: Go after your dream because your life and others depend on it. I first started writing my book not realizing it was a book, but more as a journal exercise when I was going through a really challenging time in my life. I was at a crossroads in my relationship, unhappy in my career, and feeling completely stuck. The notes I wrote to myself helped me and I thought, ""What if these could help other people too?"" After making the decision to convert these notes to a book, I made it my mission to get my work out to the world. I knew it was a gift and to not share this with others for fear of the unknown or rejection was true selfishness, and I am not a selfish person. I wrote the book like my life depended on it, because the impact it will have on others will be a part of their transformation. Imagine if we all went after our dreams like our life depended on it... how many lives would we change?Lesson 4: Allow fear to serve you, rather than consume you. Fear used to dictate my life. For so many years, I was afraid to step out into the unknown because I had no idea how things would turn out. I had attended numerous courses and read a massive amount of material to learn coaching skills, but for years afterwards took no steps to make the career transition to become a coach. I was so afraid of the unknown and how things would work. But who really knows how things will work? Allow your fear to fuel you, embrace it, and know that when you are starting to feel a little uncomfortable, you must be on to something.Lesson 5: Anything is possible. You have so much power and the challenge is you might not even realize this. You may be downplaying all the amazing inner strengths that you have. You are capable of anything you set your mind to. Creating space in your mind that anything is possible is a huge gift to give to yourself. In order to achieve those goals and live your dreams you have to first believe, starting off with getting rid of all the BS that is holding you back, which face it, most likely is the inner trash talk that goes on in your head. Believe you can and you will.Lesson 6: There is power in the positive. I'm not a Pollyanna, and I don't sugar coat things. But I do believe in the power of the positive. What you focus on is what you will get. If you focus on crappy things, guess what, you are bound to find more crappy things in your life. But if you focus on all the good and amazing wonders of this world, your eyes will open up to so many more things to be grateful for, beautiful individuals you will meet everyday, and inspiration in big and small moments. Positivity is a powerful energy and one you have access to at any time.Lesson 7: We resist what we should persist. Those things we resist are the things we need to dive into with all of our energy. I remember at one point writing my book that I wanted to stop. It was getting hard and overwhelming to figure out all the logistics for writing, publishing, and marketing. It was in that moment that I had to dig deep and ask myself why? Why was I creating this movement? Why was this important? And then I realized my resistance was due to not knowing all the steps I would need to take. I couldn't figure out how this was all going to work. But I realized as long as I had my why, I would figure out the how. I realized that what I was really resisting was part of a grand plan much bigger than myself and that it was time to stop resisting and start moving forward.Lesson 8: A grateful heart sets the tone for the day. Gratitude is such a powerful tool that we can use to bring more abundance into our life. The abundance of feeling like we are enough, that we have enough, and that there is plenty of goodness to go around. Gratitude suffocates those feelings of scarcity and inadequacy, because our focus shifts to all that we have now and instills hope for all that is unfolding for us for the future. Embrace gratitude. Lesson 9: Do it because you love it. Do what you love. Love what you do. When you can put your heart and soul into your life's work, whether it is your profession, acts of service, or gifts you give to your family, friends, or others in this world, you are living closer and closer to your purpose. You are living a life more true and authentic and closer to your core than ever. You are contributing, growing, and feeling fulfilled at all levels, both consciously and unconsciously, igniting all senses of your body and mind. Put love into what you do and let your heart lead; it won't steer your wrong.Lesson 10: Sometimes the best way to learn, is to hold your breath and jump in! There have been plenty of times where I have been scared to death. Or wondering what the heck I was doing. But I gently remind myself that this is part of my journey and that I am learning. And learning sometimes consists of trial and error. Or sometimes you have to throw and see what sticks. Or sometimes you just have to jump. And always trust the process. You are exactly where you need to be right now. Do it and see. And if it doesn't work, do something else. And always enjoy the ride.Melissa Escaro is a life coach, author, and modern mindfulness educator.
