He called for",2013-01-21,"US President Barack Obama waves after taking the oath of office during the 57th Presidential Inauguration ceremonial swearing-in at the US Capitol on January 21, 2013 in Washington, DC. The oath was administered by US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, Jr. AFP PHOTO/Jewel Samad (Photo credit should read JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badd3743c000032000b4d30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In one of the final moments of formal indoor Inauguration activities on Monday, President Barack Obama paused in front of a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. stationed in the capitol rotunda.Few who watched Monday’s events could have missed the symmetry and symbolism of the nation’s first black president taking the oath of office on the only federal holiday set aside to acknowledge the civic contributions of another African-American, King. But as Obama delivered his second and final inaugural speech Monday -- what CNN senior political analyst David Gergen described live on the air as an address declaring “equality of opportunity” and “the essential American dream” that planted the president “squarely in the tradition of Martin Luther King,” – Obama put on display some of the ways in which his own life experiences and political philosophy converge with and diverge widely from those of King.“Unfortunately, in the decades since King’s death, we have sanitized, simplified nearly beyond recognition and neutered his ideas,” said the Rev. William Lamar, who leads the Turner Memorial African-American Methodist Episcopal Church in Maryland and is a director of the Foundations of Christian Leadership Program at Duke University’s Divinity School in North Carolina. “We have essentially made him [King] a nice Negro who brings us toys in January who tells us that we are a colorblind society. This is a man who talked about injustice and inadequate housing and health care and public education. This is a man who decried what he called the ‘homegrown terrorism,’ of segregationists and who above all things, called on this country to live up to its ideals. I think there are many of us who hope that President Obama will shape the next four years in that vein.”Near the end of his life, King, an avowed pacifist, took the unpopular stance of opposing the Vietnam War. He called for reforms to the draft and wanted greater government investment in public infrastructure, health care, quality education and universal voting rights. King also called on the government to help reduce poverty.King embraced the struggles of low-wage workers and those living in substandard housing. He saw a straight line between low-quality education for children, limited economic opportunities for these same children later in life, and the nation’s decision to invest and engage in military conflicts. He predicted that the country’s tendency to think of itself as the world’s chief educator and police officer would help to fuel civil wars in Africa, Asia and Latin America, while zapping much-needed resources for domestic improvements.“[Because of] our failure to really deal with economic exploitation...I do feel that we are on the wrong side of the world revolution,” King said in a series of interviews conducted by the late Canadian journalist Eleanor Fischer between 1961 and 1967 and made publicly available for the first time this month by New York’s NPR station, WNYC – FM.“We are not here to police the world. We have neither the moral, the physical nor the economic resources to patrol the world. We have the economic resources to revive the world. And, if we would see that, I think we would take a new course of action altogether. And, we can be a major force in bringing into being … [a] revolution of values.” You can listen to the entire 1966 and 1967 interview here:The WNYC tapes also reveal ways in which Obama and King’s lives might have further converged if an assassin had not prematurely taken King’s. While talking about the fact that both the Republican and Democratic parties included elected officials who supported the Vietnam War and growing militarism, King casually mentioned one idea that until 2008 had seemed unimaginable and another that has still not yet come to fruition.“Some have even gone to the point of talking to me about forming such a third force or third party and running for President,” King said. “First, I have no presidential desires and I have no desire to engage in partisan politics, so that would almost negate that altogether. I feel though, that a maybe a third force is needed now ... So I would not oppose a third party. I think it would bring a new dimension to our country that we desperately need.”Approaching what is likely the final chapter of his political career on Monday, Obama saluted the importance of peace and an end to the idea of “perpetual war.” He called for help building a country where opportunity and equal treatment are realities for people of color, women, gay Americans, the poor and those struck by unforeseeable tragedy. Obama is also a president who stood at the inaugural podium after a first term during which the United States deployed unmanned drones against its enemies. Obama counts tracking and killing Osama bin Laden among his administration's chief accomplishments. His administration deported a record number of undocumented immigrants. And, after inheriting the deepest recession since the Great Depression, under President Obama the share of Americans living in poverty rose.In his speech, Obama endorsed the occasional necessity of both ideological and physical war. He described what he sees as the essential role of government and regulation in a free market, and the necessity of a social safety net, immigration reform and expanded environmental protections. “What makes us exceptional — what makes us American — is our allegiance to an idea,"" Obama said, ""articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.’ Today we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing.”"

""It was brutal,"" he told Morgan during the Friday night interview. ""I was not 'winning' at all. I think what a lot of people don't realize is I was completely broke, because, you know, when they kept my back-end and fired me and all that, I didn't have any money left. So, I was using the tour to actually pay child support and mortgages and stuff like that. You know? So I'm grateful for that.""Sheen said that opening night in Detroit was the moment he questioned if he might give it all up. ""It was in Detroit ... that was bad,"" he said. ""Detroit was bad ... [I was] dodging stuff. Literally dodging stuff."" The Detroit show was married by boos and walkouts. The show was criticized by its haphazardness, but it made Sheen $7 million in just one month, according to TMZ. ""The forward momentum of it kind of lost its luster after about show seven,"" he said. ""And I knew I had 15 or 14 left... I didn't have an act. There was no act. I think people were expecting to show up and literally watch me die on stage or spontaneously combust or just like suddenly become cash and women. I don't know what they were expecting."" Sheen also discussed his Comedy Central Roast, saying that nothing hurt his feelings. ""I like everybody that was there and it was really smart humor. How do you take that personally? You can't."" Up next for the 47-year-old actor is the comedy ""A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III,"" due out Feb. 8 and co-starring Jason Schwartzman and Billy Murray. In the opening scene, one of the questions posed is, ""Do you feel like people don’t understand you?""""I don’t think they do,"" the actor told the Daily Beast last week. ""But I think they’re starting to. I think that whole meltdown a couple of years ago, as bizarre as it was and whatever happened as a result, it gave people a chance to see that I didn’t have to play the part of the guy being interviewed or whatever mask I had to put on. I just went, 'F**k it. This is who I am.' But now, people are like, 'Well, this is the guy we came to know way back when.'"" "

The US Postal Service is expecting their budget deficit to reach $7 billion, up from earlier projections of $6 billion. The Postal Service is seeking permission from Congress to go to a 5 day delivery week to make up some of the deficit.

As the United States honors Martin Luther King's civil rights legacy on Monday, many African-American workers may be facing new obstacles to achieving and maintaining a middle-class life style.African-Americans represent 13.1 percent of the U.S. population and 11.6 percent of the labor force, according to a 2012 U.S. Department of Labor report. Nearly one in five African-American workers hold government jobs such as mail clerks, firefighters and teachers, the report said.""There's a long tradition of the public sector being more friendly, or less hostile, to African-American workers,"" said Robert Zieger, emeritus professor of history at the University of Florida in Gainesville. ""The Post Office is the best example.""African-Americans make up about 20 percent of U.S. Postal Service workers - and are the majority in some urban centers, representing 75 percent to 80 percent of the 5,000 letter carriers in the Chicago area, according to Mack Julion, president of the Chicago branch of the National Association of Letter Carriers.But the public sector has cut nearly 600,000 jobs since 2009, due to shrinking government budgets and a range of other issues, according to the Bureau of Labor Relations. The slower recovery for African-Americans in the labor market has, in part, been the result of government layoffs after the end of the recession was declared, according to the DOL report. In December, the black unemployment rate was 14 percent, roughly double that of whites.While some other sectors of the economy are seeing recovery, the biggest problems may be just beginning for the Post Office, the nation's second-largest civilian employer after Wal-Mart with about 536,000 career workers. POSTAL TROUBLESThe Postal Service has been hurt by a switch to electronic mail from paper communication, as well as onerous retiree payments to the government.Last week, the Postal Service Board of Governors met to discuss a range of cost-cutting measures to strengthen the service's finances following the loss of a staggering $15.9 billion in fiscal year 2012.The Postal Service, self-funded by postage sales, blames most of the losses on a pre-funding requirement enacted by Congress in 2006 that requires it to make annual payments of nearly $5.5 billion in health benefits for future retirees.The U.S. Congress has not been able to agree on legislation to overhaul the agency. The postmaster general has proposed eliminating Saturday mail delivery, closing some facilities and changing its benefit payment obligations, but congressional approval is needed for the more significant measures.With no action by Congress, the postal service is losing $25 million a day, by some estimates, and could run out of money by October.""I'm afraid that Congress is going to fiddle while the Post Office burns,"" said Philip Rubio, assistant professor of history at North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro.A PLACE FOR JOBSWhy are there so many African-Americans in the Post Office?Because historically it was less prone to racial discrimination than other employers and offered a way out of poverty, says Rubio, a former postal worker and author of the book ""There's Always Work at the Post Office: African American Postal Workers and the Fight for Jobs, Justice and Equality.""In 1865, the U.S. Post Office opened to black workers. The jobs were attractive to educated African-Americans who found their skills were not appreciated in the private sector, Rubio said. Former postal workers of note include novelist Richard Wright and actor Sherman Hemsley.""It became a magnet for African-Americans who gravitated to the one place where they could take the test and they knew once they got in and became career employees, they were set,"" Rubio said. By World War One, 10 percent of the Postal Service's work force was African-American.After an executive order by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 banned discrimination in the government and defense industries, there was a sharp rise in postal employment among African-American men and women, Rubio said.""Public service, particularly for African-Americans, was an opportunity - all you need is a high school diploma,"" said Julion.Dortch-Hardy took the Postal Service test after graduating from high school on Chicago's South Side, but there were no openings, and she did not get a job immediately. She moved to Memphis, attended college and worked in a bank. But when the Post Office called -- she jumped at the chance for better pay and benefits, and returned to Chicago.Except for very hot or heavy-snow days, and the time she had to jump over a fence while pregnant to escape a ferocious dog, she has enjoyed her 15 years of service. Without it, she feels she might have to work two or three retail jobs to provide adequately for her four children, the oldest of whom is about to start college.And while she and her husband, also a postal worker, are not worried about losing their jobs, she says: ""I do worry about the people coming in now."" RIPPLE EFFECTSJulion said that the loss of more Postal Service jobs would be devastating - not only to African-American communities, but all communities who rely on postal jobs and service. For example, the Postal Service is the largest employer of veterans in the nation, after the Department of Defense.The national average annual salary of career employees who work directly with mail, such as letter carriers, is $53,000 to $55,000, said a Chicago Post Office spokesman.""These are homeowners -- people with mortgages and car notes,"" Julion said. ""They are big players in their community in terms of what resources they bring to the table. They are the ones going to the barber shops, the beauty shops, the Ma and Pa shops in the neighborhoods - if you take those incomes away, it's going to be devastating.""The solution, he said, is not just to get another job - if all that's available is retail posts that cannot support a household.Even many professional jobs do not pay enough, said Julion, a father of four, who left a job as an addictions counselor to join the Postal Service because it paid better.Amisha Patel, head of Chicago's Grassroots Collaborative, whose aim is to improve worker conditions, said that the problem of crime in minority urban communities is often blamed on gangs and bad parenting.But another factor is the availability of work, with job losses leading to foreclosures and ruined neighborhoods, Patel said. ""You've seen a steady decimation of good-paying jobs, which are very much linked to the public sector.""Rubio said he hopes that President Barack Obama, who recently announced executive orders on gun control, might consider taking similar executive action to save the Postal Service, rather than waiting on Congress.It would be a ""sad irony"" if the Postal Service, a booster of minority prospects since the Civil War, should unravel under the first black president, he said.""I don't think anything now is unfixable,"" said Rubio. But if nothing is done, the damage to mail service and postal jobs ""would be very hard to undo.""

4,IMPACT,Dr. King's Call for Nonviolence,"John Dear, Contributor
Rev. John Dear is a peace activist, author, Nobel Peace Prize ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/martin-luther-king_us_5bb1a31fe4b01857b7091bea,Dr. King's principles and methodology of nonviolence outline a path to social change that still holds true.,2013-01-20,"The statue of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. is seen at the MLK Memorial September 20, 2012 in Washington, DC. King was an American clergyman, activist, and prominent leader in the African-American Civil Rights Movement. He is best known for his role in the advancement of civil rights using nonviolent civil disobedience. AFP PHOTO / Karen BLEIER (Photo credit should read KAREN BLEIER/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1a31f2000003000ffb5c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With all the talk of Obama's inauguration on the holiday for Martin Luther King, Jr., it's easy to forget that as a Christian minister, Dr. King taught and practiced revolutionary nonviolence in the tradition of Jesus and Gandhi. I think Dr. King would radically oppose the Obama Administration's war in Afghanistan, its use of drones to bomb women and children, its policies of torture and assassination, its continued maintenance of nuclear weapons, and its refusal to end poverty and hunger at home and abroad. Certainly, King would want us to carry on this struggle for peace with justice. But King would also want us to understand and practice his general methodology of nonviolence. He taught an ethic of nonviolent resistance that's a strategy of hope and transformation, which he proved works and which can still help us today in the thousands of Montgomery-like movements around the world.Dr. King outlined his way of nonviolence in his 1958 account of the Montgomery movement, Stride Toward Freedom (published by Harper and Row, pp. 83-88). There he tells the story of the movement and his own personal journey, then offers six basic points for nonviolence. Dr. King lived and taught these essential ingredients of active nonviolence until the day he died. (For an excellent commentary on them, I recommend Roots of Resistance: The Nonviolent Ethic of Martin Luther King, Jr., by William D. Watley.)These fundamental principles, along with his six steps for nonviolent action, make up Dr. King's ""to do"" list:First, nonviolence is the way of the strong. Nonviolence is not for the cowardly, the weak, the passive, the apathetic, or the fearful. ""Nonviolent resistance does resist,"" he wrote. ""It is not a method of stagnant passivity. While the nonviolent resister is passive in the sense that he is not physically aggressive toward his opponent, his mind and emotions are always active, constantly seeking to persuade his opponent that he is wrong. The method is passive physically, but strongly active spiritually. It is not passive non-resistance to evil; it is active nonviolent resistance to evil.""Second, the goal of nonviolence is redemption and reconciliation. Nonviolence does not seek to defeat or humiliate the opponent but to win friendship and understanding,"" King teaches. ""The nonviolent resister must often express his protest through noncooperation or boycotts, but he realizes that these are not ends themselves; they are merely means to awaken a sense of moral shame in the opponent... The aftermath of nonviolence is the creation of the beloved community, while the aftermath of violence is tragic bitterness.Third, nonviolence seeks to defeat evil, not people. Nonviolence is directed ""against forces of evil rather than against persons who happen to be doing the evil. It is evil that the nonviolent resister seeks to defeat, not the persons victimized by evil.""""Not only did King depersonalize the goal of nonviolence by defining it in terms of reconciliation rather than the defeat of the opponent, but he also depersonalized the target of the nonviolent resister's attack,"" Watley writes. ""The opponent for King is a symbol of a greater evil... The evildoers were victims of evil as much as were the individuals and communities that the evildoers oppressed."" In this thinking, King echoes St. Paul's admonition that our struggle is ultimately not against particular people but systems -- ""the principalities and powers.""Fourth, nonviolence includes a willingness to accept suffering without retaliation, to accept blows from the opponent without striking back. ""The nonviolent resister is willing to accept violence if necessary, but never to inflict it,"" King writes. ""Unearned suffering is redemptive. Suffering, the nonviolent resister realizes, has tremendous educational and transforming possibilities."" That's a tough pill to swallow but King insists that there is power in the acceptance of unearned suffering love, as the nonviolent resister Jesus showed on Calvary and Dr. King himself showed in his own life and death.In Stride Toward Freedom, King urged nonviolent resisters to paraphrase Gandhi and say:We will match your capacity to inflict suffering with our capacity to endure suffering. We will meet your physical force with soul force. We will not hate you, but we cannot in all good conscience obey your unjust laws. Do to us what you will and we will still love you. Bomb our homes and threaten our children; send your hooded perpetrators of violence into our communicates and drag us out on some wayside road, beating us and leaving us half dead, and we will still love you. But we will soon wear you down by our capacity to suffer. And in winning our freedom we will so appeal to your heart and conscience that we will win you in the process. (p. 194)Fifth, nonviolence avoids not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit. It practices agape/love in action. ""The nonviolent resister not only refuses to shoot his opponent; he also refuses to hate him. At the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love."" Cutting off the chain of hate ""can only be done by projecting the ethic of love to the center of our lives."" Love means ""understanding, redemptive good will toward all people."" For King, this agape/love is the power of God working within us, Watley explains. That is why King could exhort us to the highest possible, unconditional, universal, all-encompassing love. King the preacher believed that God worked through us when we used the weapon of nonviolent love.Sixth, nonviolence is based on the conviction that the universe is on the side of justice. ""The believer in nonviolence has deep faith in the future,"" King writes. ""He knows that in his struggle for justice he has cosmic companionship. There is a creative force in this universe that works to bring the disconnected aspects of reality into a harmonious whole."" King's philosophy, spirituality, theology and methodology were rooted in hope.These core principles explain why, for King, nonviolence was ""the morally excellent way."" As he boldly expanded his campaign from Montgomery to Atlanta, Albany and eventually Birmingham, he demonstrated six basic steps of nonviolent action that could be applied to any nonviolent movement for social change. As explained in ""Active Nonviolence"" (Vol. I, ed. by Richard Deats, The Fellowship of Reconciliation, 1991), every campaign of nonviolence usually undergoes these basic stages toward justice, and they are worth our consideration:First, information gathering. We need to do our homework, and learn everything we can about the issue, problem or injustice so that we become experts on the topic.Second, education. Then we do our best to inform everyone, including the opposition, about the issue, and use every form of media to educate the population.Third, personal commitment. As we engage in the public struggle for nonviolent social change, we renew ourselves every day in the way of nonviolence. As we learn that nonviolent struggles take time, we commit ourselves to the long haul and do the hard inner work necessary to center ourselves in love and wisdom, and prepare ourselves for the possibility of rejection, arrest, jail or suffering for the cause.Fourth, negotiations. We try to engage our opponent, point out their injustice, propose a way out, and resolve the situation, using win-win strategies.Fifth, direct action. If necessary, we take nonviolent direct action to force the opponent to deal with the issue and resolve the injustice, using nonviolent means such as boycotts, marches, rallies, petitions, voting campaigns and civil disobedience.Sixth, reconciliation. In the end, we try to reconcile with our opponents, even to become their friends (as Nelson Mandela demonstrated in South Africa), so that we all can begin to heal and move closer to the vision of the ""beloved community.""Dr. King's principles and methodology of nonviolence outline a path to social change that still holds true. In his strategy, the ends are already present in the means; the seeds of a peaceful outcome can be found in our peaceful means. He argues that if we resist injustice through steadfast nonviolence and build a movement along these lines, we take the high ground as demonstrated in the lives of Jesus and Gandhi and can redeem society and create a new culture of nonviolence. Indeed, he calls us to break the cycle of violence, institutionalize nonviolent conflict resolution, end the killing, and actually set a goal for the abolition of war, poverty, hunger, and nuclear weapons.This is the vision and practice we need to recall on Dr. King's holiday, a vision we need to push the Obama administration toward realizing, a practice we can use to carry on Dr. King's work.""May all who suffer oppression in this world reject the self-defeating method of retaliatory violence and choose the method that seeks to redeem,"" Dr. King concluded. ""Through using this method wisely and courageously we will emerge from the bleak and desolate midnight of 'man's inhumanity to man' into the bright daybreak of freedom and justice."" Amen."

Participating in a stimulating conversation with guests that he invited because he found them intriguing and interested in similar things as others at the table.Starting from dinners we held for years in Mr. Jefferson's home, Monticello, I, and a few others, have turned these dinners into opportunities to connect people and foment discussions about many different causes and topics. As a result of the dinners, vibrant networks and passionate partners have been created for these causes. The dinners:• Involve potential supporters (particularly high net worth philanthropists) in an interesting discussion they will find stimulating • Enhance the dinner sponsor's reputation as a networker that listens, grows and can connect people with other interesting people and ideas • Promote a collaborative, creative environment with a small group of people focused on a common issue • Result in more passionate partners who are more likely to give time, talent and treasure to the causeHere are a few ground rules that help these dinners succeed. No more than 12 to 14 people -- but no less than eight -- may attend. With a larger number the opportunity to have everyone participate is lost. One table is used to enable a single conversation, not many. There should be no individual conversation with the person seated to the left or right of you -- all conversations are with the group at the table. This ensures 12 minds focused on one discussion. Rather than having the typical conversation with the person next to you about their kids or where he or she grew up, you participate in a conversation related to your passions.Before the dinner an email or note is sent around giving information about the people that will be attending. You can send bios if you like as well as the general topic. An opening question is included for people to be ready to discuss (for the NY Film Society we sent out the question ""what is your favorite movie?""; for an education related non-profit we used ""who was your favorite teacher and why?"").Start with your guests' storiesAs people arrive allow time for relaxed conversation and greetings. Once the dinner guests are seated, the conversation begins when a moderator asks the question that was sent ahead of time. The guests introduce themselves and answer the opening question. These simple questions allow people to start telling a bit of their own stories and linkages start occurring around the table. The conversation then tends to roll around the table with an occasional open question, related to the common interests of the dinner guests, being thrown in. The moderator guides the conversation when necessary to make sure people are heard and recognized and that those who are loud don't dominate and those that are quiet are heard.At the end of the dinner each person is asked to comment on the dinner and note to the group things they want to follow up on or that they were moved by. Typically the host keeps track of anything that should be followed up on (connections offered, books recommended, next meetings suggested) and assists in making them happen. There is never a formal pitch or extended presentation from the sponsor during the dinner which can always be done later. The goal is to start a discussion that will be continued in many ways in the future by the individuals present.New relationships formMost of these dinners go on longer than your typical dinner. During the dinners people tend to be more passionate, lively and funny. Those who are meeting each other for the first time often make sure they get contact information from their fellow guests for follow up. I have had people who were hard of hearing thank me since they could, for the first time at a dinner, hear the conversation; others who don't have English as their first language seem to like the format since it is easier to follow the conversation; and I like the dinners because, rather than half hearing a conversation because of the other conversations going around me, I (and others) can focus on one, growing, topic.The Jeffersonian Dinner format has been used by a number of nonprofits to enhance the links between donors and advocates and potential donors and a cause. It allows the development team and executive director to identify the passions of each participant and uniquely tailor a strategy to tap the skills and interests of the donor and uncover ways to help them partner with the non-profit in its various activities. Participants tend to open up more in these dinners than at a typical function.The true spirit of JeffersonI feel the spirit of Mr. Jefferson in the room at each of these dinners I attend. He is listening and smiling when each person's unique passions come out and stimulate another dinner partner's thoughts. These dinners are opportunities for people to stop, listen to others and stimulate their minds and passions. Just what Mr. Jefferson would have intended!"

Professor Wilson argued fundamentally that changes in the structure of the U.S. economy were the primary drivers of increased social and economic dislocation of the urban poor which require comparable solutions based upon national and regional economic reforms. Professor Wilson presents a public policy agenda based on this economic analysis, informed by an assessment of adverse behavioral norms and discrimination as factors facilitating the persistence of an urban ""underclass.""Twenty-five years later, given that most of these challenges have been exacerbated by the global recession, high rates of unemployment and the increased social isolation of poor urban areas, Professor Wilson's work remains relevant. I recently interviewed Professor Wilson about the contemporary relevance and legacy of the book, in light of responses to the book from academics and policy-makers, contemporary ideological narratives framing the discourse on urban poverty, current trends in the U.S. economy, the impending fiscal cliff confronting America at the end of 2012, the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther's King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech in 2013 and the social vision for America which it proclaimed, and more.The full interview will appear in the Harvard Journal of African American Public Policy in April.The almost complete restructuring of the American economy, from a predominantly manufacture-driven one to a service-driven one, in a very short time, had tremendous adverse consequences on the urban underclass just as you and others predicted when the book was written. As this continues it will undoubtedly only exacerbate the joblessness that is at the heart of the perpetuation of the underclass. How has this radical restructuring of the economy affected social dislocation and poverty in the cities since the time the book was written in general? The first edition of The Truly Disadvantaged was published 25 years ago. However, the economic processes emphasized in the book have continued -- the loss of manufacturing jobs, the movement of jobs from cities to the suburbs and overseas, and even greater internationalization of the economy, especially through trade liberalization facilitated by free trade agreements in the 1990s. Moreover, given the expansion of low-wage jobs lacking fringe benefits, and the polarization between high-wage and low-wage occupations, higher education is even more critical for social advancement in the labor market today. Furthermore, the adverse effects of deindustrialization on inner-city black employment continue to be severe. Moreover, there are still major racial differences in concentrated poverty. Although the country experienced dramatic declines in concentrated poverty in the 1990s, including declines in urban black neighborhoods, the substantial decreases may simply have been blips of economic boom in the 1990s rather than permanent trends. Unemployment and individual poverty rates have increased since 2000, and there is every reason to assume that concentrated poverty rates are on the increase again, although complete data on concentrated poverty will become available only after a more thorough analysis of the 2010 census.The problems of joblessness have continued and have even gotten worse for low-skilled blacks. The racial employment disparities have persisted. The black/white unemployment ratio seemed essentially fixed at 2.0 or greater, which means that even through economic upturns and downturns the black unemployment rate has been at least twice that of the white unemployment rate -- although during this current economic crisis the rate dipped below 2.0, because of the sharp increase in joblessness among whites.The discourse about reclaiming the American Dream for middle-class Americans has received wide attention. Do the urban poor matter in America today? Is it possible to pursue ""both-and"" approaches instead of making a choice to focus on one group or the other?Despite all the rhetoric about reclaiming the American Dream for middle-class Americans, the Obama administration has done more for lower-income Americans than any president since Lyndon Baines Johnson. Quite frankly, I think that Obama's programs have prevented poverty, including concentrated poverty, from rapidly rising, considering the terrible economy. Obama's stimulus package (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) earmarked $80 billion for low-income Americans, which included such things an extension of unemployment benefits, a temporary increase in the earned income-tax credit, and substantial additional funds for the Food Stamps (what we now call Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). It also included nearly $4 billion in job training and work force enhancement programs and $2 billion for neighborhood stabilization efforts. Moreover, I consider the health care legislation as an antipoverty program. Over the long term the health care legislation will significantly benefit lower income Americans. Indeed the share of Americans who are uninsured declined between 2010 and 2011. And this improvement was in part due to a provision of he Health Care Bill that that allows children to remain on their parents' health plan until they reach age 26.Also, Obama worked out a deal with Republicans to address the impact of the recession on lower-income Americans, a negotiation, which, although resulting in an extension the Bush-era tax cuts, led to a 13-month extension of federal unemployment benefits for more than seven million jobless worker, as well as the continuation of programs that benefit the poor and working classes, including (a) the earned-income tax credit, (b) the refundable component of the Child-Tax-Credit, and (d) the 2 percent reduction in the Social Security Payroll tax for one year, all of which put more money in the hands of ordinary Americans. Finally, I should mention the $144 billion package passed in early 2012 by Congress to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance to the end of this year, programs that Obama pushed.Now, when you consider how these policies fit in with into the broader sweep of policy changes over the last few decades, one has to acknowledge that the legislation enacted was in response to the extraordinary economic situation that now plagues this country. Taken together, they far exceed any legislations beneficial to low income Americans passed during either the Carter, Ford, Reagan, George H W Bush, Clinton, or George W. Bush administrations.Next year is the 50th celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""I Have A Dream Speech."" All of the economic indicators have shown that social mobility has fallen in the US and it is more so for ethnic minorities. In light of these findings what are the prospects for the future in terms of the black, urban ""underclass""? What is the contemporary relevance of the Dr. King's Dream regarding the poverty alleviation in America?  Let me first emphasize, before I address this question directly, that a substantial segment of African-American population does not live in poverty. Many African Americans have done quite well in terms of education and employment during the last few decades. Indeed there is a widening gap between the haves and have-not in the black community. And I first call attention to this economic schism in my book, The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions, published in 1978 by the University of Chicago Press, with a second edition in 1980. I noted in that book that while the conditions of the black poor have deteriorated as reflected in increasing joblessness, slower movement out of poverty, and increasing welfare receipt since the early 1970s, the conditions of the black middle class, those blacks who are trained and education, have improved. One of the legacies of previous racism and discrimination is that a disproportionate number of blacks are still poor, lacking skills and education. And in this day and age that is a recipe for failure, because unlike in previous years, social mobility is increasingly based on educational qualifications. And given the poor educational training that so many black youngsters receive in the public schools and their high school drop-out rates, many are in danger of becoming permanent economic proletarians. Why? Because of the effects of fundamental changes in the economy. More specifically, the computer revolution rewards skilled workers, including skilled workers who are black, and displaces low skilled workers; and the globalization of the economy puts low skilled workers in this country, including low-skilled black workers, in greater competition with low-skilled workers in third-world countries. So, if you don't have skills or a decent education in this global economy your chances for mobility are minimal. This is a problem for all low-skilled workers but it is even more of a problem for low-skilled blacks because of the problem of race and employer racial preferences, not to mention the added problem of segregation, which decreases access to areas of employment growth. The problem is especially acute for low-skilled black males, and many turn to crime and end up in prison, which further marginalizes them and decreases their employment opportunities.As the late black economist Vivian Henderson pointed out several decades ago, it is as if historic racism and discrimination put blacks in their economic place, in the sense that a disproportionate percentage of the black population is poor and unskilled, step aside to watch changes in the economy, including increasing technology, destroy that place. The unfortunate thing is that those poor blacks who have lost their jobs to technological innovations and the growing internationalization of economic activity are unlikely to get them back.William Julius Wilson is the Lewis P. and Linda L.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e51a3c000018010c3b5e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Tom Bergin and Sinead CruiseLONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Growing anger at aggressive tax avoidance by big business has prompted ethical investors to consider shunning shares in companies that don't pay their fair share of tax.As governments struggle to balance massive budget deficits caused by the financial crisis, reports that big companies like Apple, Google and Vodafone pay minimal taxes in some big markets have sparked public protests in Europe and the United States.All the companies criticised say they follow the law, and some argue they owe it to investors to pay as little tax as legally possible. But politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have argued such avoidance is immoral and hauled executives into public hearings to explain their tax affairs.Tax authorities in France, Germany and Italy have even launched raids on some high-profile companies' offices.Many investors with a 'socially responsible' mandate say they have long taken account of companies' tax practices when deciding where to invest, but few if any funds have made a point of screening out companies over tax issues, according to more than a dozen industry professionals contacted by Reuters.That may be about to change.FTSE Group, which compiles the share indexes that fund managers in the UK, United States and Asia use to build investment portfolios, said it was looking into excluding companies with what it called overly aggressive tax reduction policies from its ethical index group, FTSE4Good.""Tax is one of the areas which the independent FTSE4Good Policy Committee are considering, among other criteria priorities,"" a spokeswoman said. FTSE did not say when it would reach its decision.The FTSE4Good indexes are one of the benchmarks most commonly used by ethical funds to build their portfolios. European funds invested in socially responsible investments totalled 7 trillion euros ($9.30 trillion) at the end of 2011, according to European Sustainable Investment Forum, an ethical investment industry association.Eleven percent of the $33.3 trillion in assets under professional management in the United States is invested in funds that screen for environmental and ethical factors, according to a 2012 report from the U.S. Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment. HOW TO SPOT OFFENDERSJacky Prudhomme and Helena Vines-Fiesta, co-heads of Environmental, Social & Governance research at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, said they were working on a system for screening out companies with inappropriate tax practices. The Paris-based asset manager had 513 billion euros in assets under management as of March 2012.""We are not at this stage in a position to assess tax strategies in a systematic manner due to lack of underlying data. However, we are starting to examine how we can do this in some sectors,"" Prudhomme said, but did not say which sectors.Charity ActionAid, which has campaigned against multinationals shifting profits beyond the reach of tax authorities in developing countries, said it had been working over the past nine months with fund managers who wanted advice on how to encourage companies to pay their fair share of tax.Tax policy adviser Michael Lewis said the charity planned to publish a guide for investors next month outlining how they could pressure companies on tax. This could, in time, help funds develop a framework.""It could be quite challenging"" to come up with criteria, explain them and apply them consistently, said Ryan Smith, head of corporate governance at Kames Capital, which manages the Kames Ethical Equity and Kames Ethical Cautious Managed funds.Lewis said ActionAid had been approached by mainstream funds saying aggressive tax planning may point to risky practices elsewhere. Some investors also consider how far increases in net profit are due to operational improvements, which can be maintained, or to tax management. A robust tax audit could rapidly reverse that kind of profit.""We always make sure we know what taxes the firms we invest in are paying. If they are paying a low tax rate, chances are it's unsustainable,"" said Charles Heenan, investment director at British fund management firm Kennox.In New York, where fund manager Domini Social Investments said it was looking for ways to rank companies on the basis of their tax policies, General Counsel Adam M. Kanzer said there were difficulties.For one, it could be hard to find stocks to invest in.""Unfortunately, tax avoidance practices are so widespread it is virtually impossible to exclude companies based on this issue,"" he said."
