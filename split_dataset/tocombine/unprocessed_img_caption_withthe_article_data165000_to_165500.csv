Winter offers so many wonderful seasonal activities from outdoor sports to cozy fireside chats and a wide range of destination and vacation options. Whether you are an avid skier or simply looking for the après-ski lifestyle, there is a perfect winter escape out there for you.With the snow piling up and the temperatures dropping, here are a few winter wonderlands for any type of traveler:Lake Tahoe is a great winter escape. The Lake Tahoe Ritz-Carlton is the height of luxury. With individual fireplaces in each room and floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over amazing mountain views, it truly feels like you are staying in a castle. The beautiful bedrooms help you relax and make you linger in your room a little bit longer before hitting the slopes.Lake Tahoe is a popular ski destination, but there is so much more to try, too. You can take a snowmobile tour, ice skate or cross-country ski. On a walk by the lake, I felt like I was at the center of the world surrounded by nature with snowcapped peaks in the distance and the crystal-clear water that felt more familiar to me than the Caribbean blue I love on warm weather vacations. It was so serene and isolated and completely peaceful and refreshing.The local town of Truckee offers more than just skiing with its cute little shops and cozy restaurants. And, if you just want to lounge at the resort instead of venturing out, there are fire pits at the Lake Tahoe Ritz where you can enjoy S'mores and hot chocolates fireside. The hotel also offers a marshmology class where you can learn the history of the S'more, and then you try your hand at sculpting and eating the perfect treat. It's a great activity for kids and adults alike.Jackson Hole, Wyoming, is another breathtaking winter destination. The award-winning Amangani resort located outside the Grand Teton National Park is a short drive to Jackson, and is a magnificent place to stay. Amangani means ""peaceful home."" Aman is Sanskrit for ""peaceful."" and gani is the Native American Shoshone word for ""home."" The resort truly lives up to its name. Peak skiing season runs from December through March and offers challenging slopes for the more adventurous skiers. If you prefer to stay off the trails, there's a heated outdoor swimming pool with majestic, panoramic views. You can even catch the sunset from the whirlpool -- my personal favorite spot.Amangani offers complimentary transfers to the alpine Teton Village, where you will find the après-ski lifestyle and a private ski-in and ski-out lounge. The lounge offers ski lessons, a beautiful meeting place and serves up snacks and hot beverages best enjoyed after an eventful day on the slopes.Amangani also offers horse-drawn sleigh rides. Rides are offered throughout the day from lunch to cocktail and dinner hours and throughout the evening. After an arduous day of skiing, tuck in the kids and head out for a moonlight sleigh ride with your paramour. It's a breathtaking experience as the moonlight's reflection glitters in the snow.Winter sports not your cup of tea? If adventure on the slopes is not for you, why not pursue another winter escape that will challenge you both physically and spiritually and reboot your healthy choices in the New Year? Health resorts that focus on your mental and physical well-being are a great way to enjoy winter activities and commit to a new year, new you.One of my favorite spots is Canyon Ranch in Lenox, Mass. A great destination for couples, friends or solo travelers, Canyon Ranch offers a different kind of winter escape where you can take care of your outer and inner self. From cross-country skiing that lets you soak in the beautiful wintry landscape to hikes, and tai chi walks in the crisp air, Canyon Ranch will invigorate you after a dessert-filled holiday season. With delicious, nutritious food and cooking classes, health lectures, yoga options and spa services, you can cater to your whole self. Instead of reading a self-help book indoors, why not get out and live it at a destination retreat?No matter where you end up, you can craft a perfect winter's day, whatever that may be for you. My ideal winter vacation begins when I wake up and go to a local coffee shop for a steaming morning brew and rub elbows with the locals. Whenever I travel, I try to mix and mingle with residents to find out about the best-kept local secrets and hot spots. It's a wonderful way to visit unique places that you cannot find in travel guides.After my coffee, I try to squeeze in a workout, whether a class offered through the resort, an outdoor activity or just hitting the hotel treadmill. Then I treat myself to a breakfast with lots of protein and carbs to get myself energized for the exciting day ahead. I always try to take advantage of spa services from massages to facials. They are a great treat and a wonderful way to relax after an active winter's day. Many resorts have libraries too, where you can rest and rejuvenate with a great book curled up by the fire, another one of my favorite activities.Keep in mind that most winter resorts offer so much more than skiing. From snowmobiling to ice fishing, dog sledding, or tubing and sledding, for those who are not avid skiers there are still active, fun winter activities to explore.I enjoy staying at winter resorts that offer individual fireplaces in each room and terraces where you can take in views of snowcapped peaks. As a flight attendant, I see a thousand or more people a day sometimes, and these winter hideaways offer a great private sanctuary to relax and renew. I have yet to meet a marble bathtub that I do not like, and after a day of skiing or snowboarding, it's such a treat to soak in a beautiful bath.I always take something home with me after a great trip to remind myself of the wonderful memories I made there. Whether it is a souvenir I bought at a little shop, something from nature I found during a hike or beautiful snapshots I took of my adventures, I love having something tangible from each unique trip.So, get out in the cold this season and explore some new adventures!Follow me on Twitter (@Wingwoman_Tracy) and share your favorite winter escapes."

3,FOOD & DRINK,Academy Awards Food: Silver Linings Playbook 'Homemades' And 'Crabby Snacks',,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/academy-awards-food-silver-linings_us_5b9cc150e4b03a1dcc818989,Behind the mysterious snack featured in Silver Linings Playbook.,2013-01-28,"US actor Bradley Cooper poses during a photocall for Silver Linings Playbook on January 21, 2012 in a hotel in Rome. Silver Linings Playbook is a film by David O. Russell. AFP PHOTO / TIZIANA FABI (Photo credit should read TIZIANA FABI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc15024000050005352a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"David O. Russell's hit film ""Silver Lining's Playbook,"" adapted from the novel by Matthew Quick, centers around a charmingly dysfunctional family whose favorite pastime is cheering on the Philadelphia Eagles. To prepare for Eagles games, the protagonist's mother (Jacki Weaver) creates snacks that have gained notoriety not only among family members, but among neighbors and friends of her son. Crabby snacks and homemades are mentioned so nonchalantly throughout the film that a viewer could safely assume that the snacks are Philadelphian staples, but that's not the case. Examiner.com debunks the myth, and explains where producer David O. Russell got the idea for the script:The film was shot in a neighborhood in Philadelphia down the street from Mrs. Cappelletti - mother of Hall of Fame football player John Cappelletti. She had Russell over to her home before filming began and offered snacks to Russell calling them crabbies and homemades. Russell assumed that they were a traditional serving of snacks found in most homes in Philadelphia. But after filming was completed, Bradley Cooper told Russell that when he grew up in Philadelphia he never had heard of either snack. So crabbies and homemades may be just a creation of Mrs. Cappelletti.So what are crabby snacks and homemades? We did a little sleuthing to find out.Matthew Quick, the author of the book, tweeted a photo of crabby snacks recently. The dish traditionally involves crab meat, cheese spread and some seasonings spread on English muffins. Alternatively, some crabby snacks can be made without any crab -- the ""crabby"" refers to a type of Old Bay seasoning -- and involves a dip made with cheddar, mustard and paprika. Here are a few recipes to try out:Crabby snacks recipe from Lindsey's Luscious New England Crabby Melts from Group RecipesWhen Philadelphians refer to ""homemades,"" they're usually talking about homemade egg noodles. This nickname was adopted by Italian-Americans in southern Philadelphia. However, Matthew Quick's book doesn't include the term, and instead only discusses homemade pizza made by Pat's mom, with toppings such as hamburger and chicken.  "
4,WELLNESS,Walking Pneumonia: What Almost Kept Jennifer Lawrence Home From The SAG Awards?,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/walking-pneumonia-jennifer-lawrence-sag-awards_us_5b9cc1ffe4b03a1dcc819195,"Symptoms of ""walking pneumonia"" include chills, cough, shortness of breath and fever, though other, less-common symptoms",2013-01-28,"Actress Jennifer Lawrence poses backstage with the award for best female actor in a leading role for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" at the 19th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Sunday, Jan. 27, 2013. (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc1ff25000036003631e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Actress Jennifer Lawrence, who took home the award for female actor in a leading role at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards last night for her performance in ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" almost missed the whole event because she had ""walking pneumonia,"" according to news reports. Lawrence, 22, reportedly missed the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Awards on Saturday because of the lung infection.But Glamour magazine reported that Lawrence rallied to attend the SAG Awards, even telling E! presenter Giuliana Rancic that ""Everyone is scared of me. I'm like, 'I'm fine!'"" Even though ""walking pneumonia,"" also known as atypical pneumonia, sounds like it might be more spreadable than the regular type of pneumonia, it's actually a milder form, WebMD reported. The word ""walking"" is used because people who have it are often well enough to walk around. This type of pneumonia is most common in younger people, such as children and adults younger than age 40. The Mayo Clinic reported that ""walking pneumonia"" is caused by bacteria that produces less severe symptoms, and usually antibiotics aren't needed to treat it because symptoms will go away on their own. The A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia reported that the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumonia, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila are often responsible for this form of pneumonia. Symptoms of ""walking pneumonia"" include chills, cough, shortness of breath and fever, though other, less-common symptoms include headache, sweating, muscle aches, chest pain, confusion and loss of appetite, according to the A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia. WebMD reported that symptoms usually appear anywhere from 15 to 25 days after the person was first exposed to the bacteria. A patient is usually contagious for about 10 days or fewer, though usually it takes being in close contact with an infected person for prolonged periods of time in order to catch it. "
