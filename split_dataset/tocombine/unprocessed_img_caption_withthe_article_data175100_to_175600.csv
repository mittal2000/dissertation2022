Simply enjoy it as a side dish, add it to soups, to salads and more. Since it's a whole grain, farro does take a bit longer to cook, but the end result is worth the trouble. That slight chewy texture and nutty flavor makes it preferable to many other whole grains that can get mushy if overcooked -- farro stays firm and is one of the easiest grains to cook.We've gathered a great collection of farro recipes from across the web.

3,HOME & LIVING,Why I DIY: 5 Reasons Everyone Should Build Their Own Furniture,"Kristan Higgins, Contributor
New York Times and USA Today bestselling author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diy-ideas_us_5b9c648be4b03a1dcc7e50d5,You'd think I'd be tired of doing things myself.,2012-10-11,"Painting wooden boards with white protective paint with a brush. Do it yourself, DIY",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c648b2200003000d937ec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I love DIY.After building our home from scratch and all the furniture in it, you'd think I'd be tired of doing things myself. But despite building hundreds of projects for my blog and designing thousands of furniture plans, I can think of nothing I'd rather be doing than DIYing a new project. I still get tingles as the project takes shape. Sometimes I can't sleep when I'm in the middle of a project, like a child on Christmas Eve.But this isn't just about me having a crazy obsession with DIY. There's actually good reason I keep coming back to the saw. Five of them, to be exact.1. You can save tons of moneyI originally became a DIYer because I simply didn't have the budget to buy the things I needed. A new bed would have cost us thousands of dollars -- thousands of dollars we didn't have. So I turned to DIY. Using tools from our garage and $80 in new lumber, I built our Farmhouse Bed in just eight hours. We saved thousands of dollars and built a solid wood bed we still sleep on today. After building our Farmhouse Bed, of course, I went on to furnish our entire home with handmade furniture, saving tens of thousands of dollars in the process.DIYing furniture in particular is at the top of my list because the savings are so dramatic in contrast. DIY your own throw pillows and you could save a few dollars. DIY curtains and you could save a hundred dollars. But DIY your own furniture? The savings can be in the thousands.2. You get exactly what you wantWhen you DIY, you call the shots. You are in total control. You choose the materials to use. You can make your project any size that you want. You can paint it any color that you want. You can make your furniture extra strong, or to suit a particular need. Need a triple bunk bed? Extra tall kitchen cabinets? A vanity with pull out step drawer? Bed with hidden storage compartment? When you DIY, you are the boss of your project.3. DIY can be greenForget made in America, or even made locally--DIY is handmade right in your home. And what could be greener than that? When I DIY furniture, I often use reclaimed wood or locally grown wood for my projects. In contrast to retail furniture, which may have started out as trees in America, then shipped overseas and reshipped back to America to stores, and then finally to your home, DIY furniture can be a very green alternative.When you DIY, you can also choose green materials without upping the cost substantially, if at all. I often build projects for free using reclaimed wood. And for new projects, I can choose to use rapidly renewing wood sources, plywood made with soy-based adhesives instead of formaldehyde, and paint with low or no VOC paints. 4. DIYing is a healthy family activityIt's not uncommon to find our family in the garage after dinner, with Mom cutting boards while Dad is armed with the drill at the work bench, and our daughter busy painting scrap blocks and gluing them together. The time we have spent DIYing a project together is treasured in our busy schedules. We've bonded together as we've created projects together, building much more than a table or bench in the process. We are also building memories tied to each project we DIY.DIY also requires movement and exercise, burning upwards of 300 calories an hour, so as a Mom, I am comforted to know our hobby isn't just healthy for our budget and earth, but it is healthy for my family as well.5. DIYing is fun and rewardingBut like all choices in life, what keeps me excited about DIYing is very simple: DIY is fun and rewarding. We all have an inner child in us that just wants to do something because it's enjoyable. Remember building with Lincoln logs or legos as a kid? Or play forts with blankets and chairs? Wasn't that fun? Guess what? DIYing as an adult is super fun, and you may be surprised how exciting it is to build your own table or bed! And when you finish your project and move it inside, and your child wants to sleep in his or her own bed because Mom made it special for them, or your family sits down to eat dinner at a table you made, the sense of accomplishment will get you excited to build your next project.So the next time you're thinking about buying something, consider this: Do you want to save money? Can you make it to better suit your needs? Would you rather not deal with packaging waste and make greener choices? Does your family need some healthy bonding time? Try DIYing. You'll be surprised at how fun and rewarding it is!Visit Ana's website. Pick up a copy of her book, The Handbuilt Home. "
4,PARENTING,Why I Read The Sad Things,"Devon Corneal, Contributor
Mother, writer, lawyer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sad-parenting-stories_us_5b9c65b5e4b03a1dcc7e58d9,We don't get to stop because things get hard -- we are supposed to save our weaknesses for the quiet hours of the night.,2012-10-11,Relaxed working with her children at laptop in living room,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c65b51f00002c002133e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My husband found me the other night, huddled over my computer, tears streaming down my face, unable to speak. I'd like to say this is an uncommon occurrence, but that would be a lie. I've always been a crier. Becoming a mother has only made things worse by stripping away whatever buffer I may have once had that kept the troubles of the world distant and remote. On this particular evening, however, I couldn't stop weeping. I had just finished the last of Sheila Quirke's memorial posts about her daughter Donna's fight against cancer. Donna was four when she passed away, and every one of Sheila's posts illuminating her short life left me undone. I had the same reaction to Emily Rapp's ""Notes From a Dragon Mom"" which describes how she raises a child she knows will die of Tay Sachs before his third birthday.   My husband gave me a hug and some Kleenex and gently asked me why I keep reading. Why, he wondered, do I read about children suffering when I know I will end up a puddle on the floor? (He is not one to shy away from the unpleasant, but stories about children dying are too much for him.) It would be easier to avoid them, I know. But I can't. No matter how painful or raw, I read the stories I know will make me cry.  I don't limit myself to the hard stuff. I am obsessed with anything related to children and the people who raise them. Videos of a boy and his favorite toy train. Illustrations of crappy kids. Provocative articles on breastfeeding and vaccinations. A call to arms for children in foster care. Baby names. Anything, absolutely anything, written by Jenny Lawson. Honey Boo Boo -- please don't ask why. All of it finds its way onto my computer screen, my nightstand or my DVR. I share what I find with anyone who will listen, which usually means interrupting my husband while he's trying to work. I think he's only listening about 25% of the time, but he nods convincingly. I like cute pictures, insightful and touching stories, and dubbed baby videos. They capture the fun of raising kids. They remind me that I'm not alone in this parenting thing. I just don't learn much from them. I learn from the hard stories. In a crucible, we discover what we're made of, so I read the stories of parents facing horrible loss to understand what it means to be a parent. I consider the worst and remind myself to hope for the best. I try to figure out how people survive what feels inconceivable. Then I force myself to imagine what they're going through, because saying, ""I can't imagine what you're going through,"" is a cop-out. I can. So can you. We just don't want to. I read to understand anger. I read so I'll remember not to judge. I read for perspective and to be reminded that that even in the face of loss and pain and doubt and confusion, life does not stop. Someone has to go to work, make dinner, fold the laundry, oversee homework, walk the dog and tuck little people into bed. We don't get to stop because things get hard -- we are supposed to save our weaknesses for the quiet hours of the night. I read to recognize bravery and to confront the fears I try to ignore.I read because these parents endure and, somehow, in the devastation, they find laughter. And hope. I read for those moments. I read because, no matter how unfair or tragic their challenges, these families are willing to share their joy and strength with anyone who has the courage not to turn away. If grieving moms and dads can make their sadness public, I don't think I have the right to escape falling to pieces in private. They deserve witnesses and so do their children. Nothing I feel can change what they're going through, and maybe it's presumptuous to think that anything I do on this side of a computer screen matters. But on the off chance that my reading makes a parent feel like they've been heard, or that they're understood, or that they're not alone, I'll keep at it."

And the leaves and the farmer's market stalls aren't the only things that are changing. Our cocktail culture is easing into a new type of seasonal sipping, white wine spritzers be damned. My fall Friday night beverage of choice is definitely a tumbler of bourbon - or this Kentucky Maple Leaf cocktail. True small batch bourbon, made from corn, is gluten-free, and it's one of those unexpected dinner party pairings that puts the old bottle of red to shame. So I've taken the time to highlight some dishes that pair particularly well with bourbon. Serve them as a full dinner party meal, or simply dabble in them here and there. If there is one rule of thumb to take away, it is that you can safely assume that anything with bacon or ham will be a good pairing. The Southerners do know what they're doing down there, and I'm pretty sure most Kentucky residents drink more bourbon than water. Not to make generalizations or anything. But you will probably be off to a great start if you pair any classic Southern dish with bourbon, as I'm usually hard pressed to find any menu item without cured meat in it below the Mason Dixon line.Think sweet, smokey, and maybe just a little hint of Cajun spice.

7,DIVORCE,The Five Musts For Dealing With Domestic Violence In Your Divorce,"Joseph E. Cordell, Contributor
Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-five-musts-for-dealin_us_5b9c5ec9e4b03a1dcc7e2a61,"When guys going through divorce say they are the victims of domestic violence, they are often met with blank stares, suspicion and disbelief.",2012-10-10,wooden gavel in hand and books on wooden table on gray background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c5ec926000032007f73bf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Unfortunately, when guys going through divorce say they are the victims of domestic violence, they are often met with blank stares, suspicion and disbelief. Oft-quoted statistics would suggest this month is devoted primarily, if not entirely, to drawing attention to violence against women. For example, according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, one in every four women will be a victim of domestic violence in her lifetime. Eighty-five percent of reported domestic violence entails a woman as the victim, and every year, at least 1.3 million women are assaulted by their significant other. Certainly, this violence against women is unacceptable.However, just a few years ago, the National Centers for Disease Control reported that 40 percent of the victims of severe physical domestic violence were actually men and that statistic is climbing. Moreover, more than one-half of the domestic assaults involving deadly weapons were actually against men. Men are less likely to report domestic violence whether out of fear of ridicule or a lack of support or the need to ""be a man."" As a result, agencies lack the data needed to do additional research. For divorce lawyers in the courtroom, the claim that the husband is the victim is often received as an overstatement designed to garner sympathy for the man and/or place blame on the woman, as a desperate attempt to win a custody battle, as an underhanded way to inject fault in a no-fault divorce case, or worse. And the lack of statistics and studies only frustrates our argument in the courtroom that none of this is true.Let me be clear. Violence against women should not be tolerated, just as violence against men should not be tolerated. But in my experience and in the opinions of other Cordell & Cordell attorneys, men have a harder case to prove that they are the victims, not the perpetrators. In order to prove your case -- as well as protect your family -- when domestic violence is an issue in your divorce, consider following these five ""musts.""Must #1: Call the police. Do not wait for things to get physical; assaults include threats intended to put you in fear of imminent harm, and domestic violence includes verbal, emotional and financial conduct as much as physical. Follow the officers' advice. Do not tell the officers that you do not want your spouse to go to jail -- like many spouses do -- because that will relieve the violent spouse from facing the consequences.Must #2: Get psychological evaluation for your spouse. Often, abusers have mental health or substance abuse issues that perpetuate the tendency to be violent. You may also find that your spouse was raised in a household in which violence was acceptable, or at least tolerated. Understanding the mental health dynamics may help both of you seek out and utilize the best resources to repair your relationship, if it is reparable. Must #3: Request child custody evaluations. Similarly, if child custody is disputed, do not hesitate to ask that your family undergo a custody evaluation. Request an evaluator who is trained in domestic violence treatment -- someone who will not conclude that your claims are overstatements -- and that the evaluation focus on each parent as well as each child's relationship with each parent and how domestic violence does or does not impact that relationship. Sadly, even when children are not the direct victims of domestic violence, they are the indirect victims and, worse, pawns.Must #4: Attend separate counseling.Do not engage in ""family counseling"" or ""joint counseling"" until you and your spouse engage in separate counseling successfully. Family counseling and joint counseling are not helpful. They allow the perpetrator to blame the victim and require the victim to participate in and take responsibility for the perpetrator's problems. Must #5: Find the courage to speak up.Victims will only receive help if they speak up. Speak to your family, your friends, your attorney, your church leader, or whoever will listen to you and not judge. Contact your community mental health department for help lines, free and low cost housing, counseling and attorney referrals. Not reporting domestic violence because of the stigma attached -- in a divorce or otherwise -- is simply not an option when your life, and your child's, is on the line."

Matthew, a 15-year-old patient of mine, recently demanded of his parents. When they refused, Matthew slashed his left wrist with a box cutter. His parents called the police and he was taken to the county hospital emergency room for evaluation and possible admission to the psychiatric ward. His parents had withheld the medication for Matt's purported attention deficit disorder (ADD) because they hadn't liked the side effects of irritability and anger they had associated with their son's use of the medication.Matthew was enraged. His parents had taken away his cell phone and all access to the Internet because they felt he was making no effort at all early in his sophomore year in high school, either in class or in doing homework. Matthew felt he ""couldn't"" do his work without the medication and didn't think his mood on the medicine was a major problem. He and his parents had been arguing about his restrictions when, in essence, Matthew had a temper tantrum, threatening to cut himself. When his parents held firm, he injured himself with a dramatic act but fortunately made only superficial lacerations to his wrist. I've witnessed many other dramas in my 34 years as a behavioral pediatrician and family therapist, but Matthew's recent episode epitomized for me a tectonic shift in the way adolescents view psychiatric drugs, especially the performance-enhancing stimulants (Adderall, Ritalin, Concerta, etc.). As recently as 15 years ago, I had a difficult time convincing young to mid-adolescents to try any psychiatric drug: Prozac, Adderall, whatever. I used to share my frustration with parents that their child was refusing my medications but was quite ready to self-medicate with marijuana, alcohol or other illegally-obtained substances. But with teenagers now insisting on pharmaceuticals as solutions to their problems, I wonder if that's really making progress. While there could be multiple reasons for their problems, these days I've noticed teenagers regularly telling their parents they ""can't"" concentrate on school or homework and asking for medication. Ironically, it's their parents who have become more uneasy or reluctant to immediately give their children stimulants (amphetamines or some variation of them) to improve their school performance or behavior at home. Some parents are understandably worried about side effects or the risks of addiction and abuse. Actually, most children (and people) can tolerate the side effects (if any) to the stimulants. Used properly (in my practice parents are entirely in charge of these drugs), the risk of physical addiction is close to if not zero. But many parents are also concerned about Adderall's ""quick fix"" nature of the teens' solution to their problems.Adderall improves anyone's performance on boring and repetitive tasks. It will not make someone smarter. Indeed, despite decades of use, evidence that long-term learning or grades improve is absent to scant. Most consistently, it does give someone the sense that they are doing better and therefore often improves motivation. The work gets done. However, inconsistently or unmotivated naturally-distracted teenagers learn nothing about how to make themselves do the uninteresting or challenging tasks necessary to grow to be mature adults.Undoubtedly some will say ""Well that's exactly what teenage ADD is -- difficulty making yourself do something you're not interesting in!"" Indeed, it's impossible to distinguish the behavioral symptoms of ADD from those of an inconsistently or unmotivated adolescent. There is no blood test or brain scan for ADD or for any psychiatric disorder for that matter. Nevertheless, doctors do seem more ready to offer these drugs to all people. What have changed are the teens' attitudes toward these meds. They want them and ask for them. While not worrying about physical addiction, I've seen psychological addiction and dependency in teenagers for Adderall. Also, teens in high school and college students are increasingly obtaining the drug illegally (mostly from friends who've gotten prescriptions from their doctors). Some colleges report 35 percent of the students have tried Adderall-type drugs for studying or getting high (remember, it is amphetamine). For subgroups, like fraternity or sorority seniors, rates have been estimated as high as 80 percent. Used improperly or unsupervised, serious abuse and addiction can occur. Additionally, these drugs can be a pathway to the misuse and abuse of other prescription medications like Oxycontin and street drugs like methamphetamine.There's certainly a place for these medications in the treatment of ADD. But I think we've done too good a job of ""selling"" ADD and Adderall as the answer to many teenagers who are in a normative struggle toward maturity. Unfortunately, there are few cultural influences strong enough to the counter the power of the medical-pharmaceutical industry that successfully brought our country's attention to the problems of attention. ""Just say 'No'"" didn't work with street drugs. Sadly, it's unlikely to work with ADD drugs like Adderall as well.For more by Lawrence Diller, M.D., click here.For more on ADHD, click here."

They will go from 15 percent for 2012 to at least 20 percent for 2013.If it appears that the tax hikes actually will take effect, stocks could decline as investors unload shares to lock in lower current rates. But regardless of whether there are increases, long-term gains will continue to be taxed more favorably than short-term gains from sales of assets owned less than 12 months.With all these uncertainties, should savvy investors opt to realize short-term gains from sales of assets owned less than 12 months, so as to nail down profits, albeit causing them to be nicked for taxes at the same rates (as high as 35 percent for 2012) as ordinary income from sources like salaries and pensions? Or is the wiser strategy to stand pat until those profits become long-term, meanwhile hazarding declining prices that more than offset the lower taxes?To illustrate the alternatives, assume that Norma Bates' regular income-tax bracket is at least 25 percent -- for 2012, taxable income above $35,350 for singles and $70,700 for joint filers. Norma has a sizable unrealized gain on shares of Beefsteak Uranium, a volatile stock she has owned for fewer than 12 months. She's considering selling her BU shares for fear of plummeting prices caused by terrorist attacks or world instability. Her worst fear: photos of BU's top execs being booked on charges of securities fraud and larceny -- for instance, cooking the books, spending company funds on personal indulgences (like the infamous $6,000 shower curtain for the home of L. Dennis Kozlowski, the fired and convicted chief of Tyco International Ltd.), or other kinds of corporate chicanery. Without getting into the issues of price volatility and potential market shocks, Norma has two options for that kind of short-term paper profit. The first option is to unload the shares now and secure the short-term gain, but suffer the loss of at least 25 percent and as much as 35 percent of the gain to the IRS. Plus, depending on where she lives, she may also owe state and/or city taxes on this money. The other option is to hold off on a sale until the gain becomes long-term, and forfeit no more than 15 percent of it to the IRS, plus local levies. The drawback, as noted, is a price drop that exceeds the taxes saved. How much of a drop can Norma endure while waiting until she qualifies for the lower rate and still be no worse off after taxes? For the answer, she uses the following three-step formula: First, figure her after-tax return on the short-term gain. Second, divide this amount by her after-tax return on the same amount of long-term gain. Third, multiply the short-term gain by the resulting percentage. The result shows how much the price can drop, yet permit Norma to keep as much after taxes from a smaller long-term gain as she would from a larger short-term gain.To make the math less formidable, suppose Norma's paper profit is $10,000. Her combined federal and state brackets for gains is 30 percent for short-term and 20 percent for long-term. A $10,000 gain (after any sales expense) taxed at 30 percent entitles the tax collectors to $3,000 and leaves Norma with $7,000. The same $10,000 taxed at 20 percent leaves her with $8,000. Divide $7,000 by $8,000; the resulting percentage is .875. Multiply $10,000 by .875 and the result is $8,750. A smaller long-term profit of $8,750 taxed at 20 percent leaves Norma with $7,000, as much as would be received were she to sell for a $10,000 gain and be taxed at 30 percent.Given those numbers, when does a decision to sweat out the 12-month holding period leave Norma worse off after taxes? Not until her paper profit drops from its present $10,000 to below $8,750--that is, by more than $1,250. Julian Block is an attorney and author based in Larchmont, N.Y.
