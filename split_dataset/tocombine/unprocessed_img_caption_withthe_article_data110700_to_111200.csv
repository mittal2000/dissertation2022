The Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council last week agreed to send a team to investigate killings and other abuses carried out by the group on ""an unimaginable scale"".Zeid, Jordan's former U.N. ambassador and a Jordanian prince, described Islamic State in his maiden speech to the Council as ""takfiris"" - people who justify killing others by branding them as apostates.""Do they believe they are acting courageously? Barbarically slaughtering captives? ... They reveal only what a Takfiri state would look like, should this movement actually try to govern in the future, said Zeid who succeeds Navi Pillay in the Geneva hotseat.""It would be a harsh, mean-spirited, house of blood, where no shade would be offered, nor shelter given, to any non-Takfiri in their midst,"" Zeid added.He called on Iraq's new government and prime minister to consider joining the International Criminal Court (ICC) to ensure accountability for crimes committed there.""In particular, dedicated efforts are urgently needed to protect religious and ethnic groups, children - who are at risk of forcible recruitment and sexual violence - and women, who have been the targets of severe restrictions,"" Zeid said. ""ONLY ANNIHILATION""The Council has an independent investigation into war crimes by all sides in Syria, where more than 190,000 documented killings have occurred during the conflict that began in March 2011, according to a report by Pillay last month. ""In the takfiri mind, as we have seen in Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Kenya, Somalia, Mali, Libya, Syria and Iraq ... there is no love of neighbor - only annihilation to those Muslims, Christians, Jews and others, altogether the rest of humanity, who believe differently to them,"" Zeid said.Zeid called for an end to Israel's seven-year blockade of the Gaza Strip and said Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank deserved to lead a normal life free of illegal settlements and what he called excessive use of force.""On this point, I also note that Israelis have a right to live free and secure from indiscriminate rocket fire,"" he said, referring to rockets fired by militants in Hamas-ruled Gaza.On Ukraine, he said ""at least 3,000 people"" have been killed since fighting began in April and called on the Kiev government, armed groups and neighboring states including Russia to protect civilians and ensure compliance with international law.Italy's envoy Maurizio Enrico Serra, speaking on behalf of the European Union (EU), condemned what it called ""the aggression by Russian armed forces on Ukrainian soil in clear contravention of international law"".Russia denies accusations by Kiev and the West that it has sent troops into eastern Ukraine to prop up a revolt by pro-Russian separatist rebels.Zeid voiced alarm at ongoing threats against activists and prospective witnesses in Sri Lanka. The Council in March launched an inquiry into atrocities in the 26-year conflict between government forces and Tamil rebels that ended in 2009.""I also deplore recent incitement and violence against the country's Muslim and Christian communities"" he said.

One of them was pregnant. The victims were also beaten and their jewelry and mobile phones stolen.Crimes against women are common but mostly take place inside homes in Afghanistan's conservative society. But a gang rape by armed men is rare in Kabul and has tapped into a vein of anxiety as foreign troops leave the country and a badly stretched Afghan army and police fight a deadly Taliban insurgency.Judge Safihullah Mujadidi in a summary trial, televised nationwide, convicted the men of armed robbery and sexual assault.""Based on criminal law these individuals are sentenced to the severest punishment which is death sentence,"" he said.The men stood before him in a heavily guarded courtroom. Outside dozens of activists gathered demanding speedy justice to instill public confidence in law and order.""This kind of gang rape is unprecedented in Kabul,"" Kabul police chief General Zahir earlier said in his testimony seeking summary punishment for the men.The assault has led to such outpouring of rage that President Hamid Karzai told a delegation of women last week that the perpetrators would face the death penalty.The men can appeal Sunday's verdict in a higher court. Karzai has to ratify the executions under Afghan law.""If this act goes unpunished, the women of Afghanistan will continue to be victims,"" said Uma Saeed, a rights activist.

No confirmed cases have been reported in the U.S., but three Americans who were infected in Africa have been brought back to the U.S. for treatment. Obama told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd that the U.S. needs to send military assets to set up isolation units and equipment to help contain the spread of Ebola. He said it will still take ""months"" before the problem is controlled. ""If we don't make that effort now and this spreads, not just through Africa but other parts of the world, there's the prospect then that the virus mutates, it becomes more easily transmittable, and then it could be a serious danger to the United States,"" the president said.The U.S. has pledged funds for health workers and supplies, but the United Nations and aid groups have urged countries to get more involved.

Pat Roberts (R-Kansas), who is locked in a tough re-election battle, said Saturday that states should be free to legalize marijuana.During a debate with independent rival Greg Orman, Roberts was asked for his position on marijuana legalization. “That's not a federal issue,"" Roberts said. ""That's a state issue. If you want to get a Rocky Mountain high, go west. That should be for the Kansas legislature and the governor to decide, not federally.”Orman also stopped short of fully endorsing legalization, but did offer criticism of the federal war on drugs.""You know, we've had a federal policy in this country since the Nixon administration that doesn't seem to be working, he said. ""We've spent over $1 trillion on it. With that said, as the senator has mentioned, we do have states that have started to work with different policies as it relates to legalization. I think it would be prudent for us to take a step back and watch what happens in those states before we determine how we want to change federal policy.""Watch the exchange here, starting around 34:40.""When a conservative Republican senator from Kansas tells the feds to let states legalize marijuana in the middle of a tight race for reelection, it's pretty clear that the days when politicians thought they needed to be as 'tough' on drugs as possible in order to get elected are over,"" Marijuana Majority chairman Tom Angell said in a statement to The Huffington Post. ""But Sen. Roberts needs to do more than just talk about change. At the very least he should team up with Sens. Cory Booker & Rand Paul on their effort to stop federal interference with state medical marijuana laws.""In June, Booker (D-N.J.) and Paul (R-Ky.) introduced an amendment to block the Justice Department from spending money against state medical marijuana laws. The House passed similar legislation in May.While marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, Colorado and Washington have implemented laws allowing recreational use of the substance and several other states are weighing similar programs. Recent polls show that a growing majority of Americans support legalization. Medical marijuana, meanwhile, is currently legal in 22 states plus the District of Columbia. Roberts has previously said that medical cannabis should not be considered a medical expense when calculating food stamp benefits. In 2012, he introduced legislation that would make it illegal to deduct medical marijuana costs when determining Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.“Federal nutrition assistance, provided by American taxpayers, should not be boosted due to one’s use of medical marijuana,"" Roberts said in a 2012 statement. ""Marijuana is illegal to use or distribute in the United States and certainly has no place in the calculation of benefits for those in need.”"

It's the moment no man is ever ready for.  Not even years of military, civil, and professional training can ever get any man ready for this.

Has the neighbor upstairs gone berserk again?  Much worse. I down the espresso, not knowing when I'll be back, needing every bit of energy I can possibly get. The task at hand does not leave my mind.  Should I even brush my teeth?  For the sake of others, I risk it, losing a few extra seconds. I go to look for the object demanded by headquarters, tumbling through a house managed by a 10-month-old.  Found it! Socks, jeans, shoes, jacket.  Almost forgot the car keys. The car opens fast.  Everything seems to be in the way, stopping me of what needs to be done -- the seat in the wrong position, the neighbors parking too close.  ""I will not be stopped by these technical matters,"" I think to myself.  Rapidly reversing, I get out of the drive. Grey skies, tons of traffic.  Does the entire city go to work at the same time?  It seems like every crossing has at least 10 people waiting to cross when I pass.  All lights are red.  Fear creeps into me -- will I make it or will I be the source of shame for every man out there, no matter of what color, race or religion? Tunnels, lights, some more lights.  Tons of cars. The clock is ticking in my head. I get to the rendezvous point, of course all parking spots are taken.  ""This will not stop me now, not so close,"" I think to myself. Risking the notorious tow to the end of the city, somewhere near Hasenbergl on Schleißheimerstraße, I run out of the car. This is a secured location, so I remind myself to breath properly, not to raise too much suspicion. Thank god the guards know me, opening the door instantaneously. Or is it just another man, knowing deep inside that another man is at risk?  Never mind about that. I close my jacket, remembering what I am wearing, being at a public space and all. Running amok around the complex, I look for the person in danger. The elevator opens -- here he is! I won't lose a second, placing the sacred object in the hands of my wife, the boss.  Success!

Equal turns hilarious and insightful, Baumbach's latest focuses on a couple in their 40s (Ben Stiller and Naomi Watts) who become friends with a couple in their 20s (Adam Driver and Amanda Seyfried). The culture wars that play out over the film's 97 minutes will especially resonate with audience members in the older demographic. Everyone else can appreciate Stiller's frazzled turn as a fledgling documentary filmmaker, his best performance since the last movie he made with Baumbach, 2010's ""Greenberg."" Stiller's become the closest thing to a modern-day Jack Lemmon that we have; no one expresses crushing frustration better.Not that Stiller is the only thing going on here: Driver, Watts, Seyfried and Charles Grodin are pretty remarkable, too. (That Adam Driver is going to have a long career.) Then there's Ryan Serhant and Adam Horovitz. You know them better as that guy from ""Million Dollar Listing"" and Ad-Rock from Beasties Boys.Let's start with Horovitz, who plays such a perfect embodiment of average, upper-middle class dads that you might not connect the dots right away between his character and Ad-Rock. Which is likely the point: In a movie about adults refusing to accept that they've become adults, what better way to illustrate that overarching theme than by having Ad-Rock wear khakis and carry a baby in a sling? Horovitz's character has got to fight for the right to wake up multiple times a night to feed his newborn. Ryan Serhant at the premiere of ""While We're Young.""But if Horovitz is a subtle marvel, Serhant is the movie equivalent of street construction on a quiet morning. He plays a hedge-fund manager named Dave (Hedge-Fund Dave as the credits note), who may help Stiller's Josh fund his six-and-a-half hour documentary about America's racist prison system, the Turkish economy and a bunch of other stuff? It's not really clear, because Josh lost the thread somewhere around 2008. ""So it's like 'Black Shawshank Redemption,' but real,"" an oblivious Dave says as he listens to Josh's pitch. Dave is an unrepentant monster who watches ""Mad Men"" for tips on how to be a douche bag; he probably idolized Ellis in ""Die Hard."" Serhant is so good at being a bro, someone should probably cast him in the ""Entourage"" movie.""While We're Young,"" which was produced by IAC Films and Scott Rudin and Barry Diller, does not have distribution, but it's only a matter of time. This has the chance to become the biggest hit of Baumbach's career by a wide margin.UPDATE: A24 picked up ""While We're Young"" and will release the film in 2015."

In one case, a woman in her fifties was hospitalized for three days.""I went to see her in hospital, I could see the injuries on her head and body,"" said Zhang Yongli, 64, whose daughter was on the flight. ""The way the police acted was very extreme, it's wrong to treat us this way.""Beijing police did not respond to requests for comment.China's government has repeatedly said it would spare no effort in the search for the plane and leaders have expressed sympathy for the families.Public security authorities have not commented on the families but Malaysia Airlines representatives said distraught relatives have sometimes been aggressive.Some relatives said they believed their homes were being watched. Police have detained people several times at an office the government has set up in a nondescript Beijing suburb where families can go to seek information about the search from Malaysia Airlines and government representatives.Detentions usually last for about 24 hours, said the families and their lawyer. Police have cited various reasons for the detentions, family members said, including a rule against large gatherings. In a couple of cases, children were taken into custody with adult relatives.In at least two other cases, recounted to Reuters by relatives, Beijing police went to family members' homes before dawn to detain them without a reason.""On some level I can understand why the police are doing this - perhaps they're used to only dealing with bad people,"" said Liu Wanyi, 26, a newlywed whose husband was on the plane.""But we're not seeking to antagonize the government in any way."" 'WHO KNOWS?'In the weeks after the flight disappeared, when media attention was intense, police were a constant presence at the Lido Hotel in Beijing, where Malaysia Airlines put up the families and held daily meetings.At one demonstration in those early weeks, dozens of police escorted family members, many weeping and holding up signs, on a march to the Malaysian Embassy - an unusual show of support for a protest in China.But as the story faded from the news and the search dragged on, authorities became less supportive, the families say.Cheng, who has two young sons and who herself has been detained at the representative office, said she had no way to access her husband's Malaysian bank account, and authorities in both countries had been indifferent to her requests for help.""Honestly, I can't endure this,"" she said. ""My life has completely changed, I can't manage to work anymore.""Most family members visit the representative office at least once a week, some traveling for hours, they said, in the hope of a shred of information.Like Cheng, many of them have quit their jobs.Police treatment of the families mirrors that meted out to so-called petitioners, who seek redress for a range of perceived injustices such as land grabs and medical malpractice, which are common complaints in China.Courts in China are controlled by the Communist Party and generally seen as beyond the reach of ordinary folk. With no other channels for pursuing complaints, people come to Beijing to make their cases but typically get short shrift.Many are detained by police or forced back to their hometowns with no progress on their grievances.As the flow of information from the search for MH370 dries up, relatives are haunted by their theories. Many said they believed the United States or other powers had withheld information or were even responsible.""I have no doubt in my mind that Obama knows,"" Liu said of the U.S. president.""No matter how much we ask, none of the responsible parties will provide any proof of what happened. Who knows what motive is behind it?"" (Additional reporting by Joseph Campbell and Reuters Pictures; Editing by Robert Birsel)"

Both retailed at $995.Rowland, who with husband Tim Witherspoon, are expecting a baby boy this fall, sat down with Zorianna Kit to talk about the watches, her pregnancy and gave an update on what's going on with her music, film and fashion careers.Zorianna Kit: People wear watches for functional purposes, others for style purposes? What's yours? Kelly Rowland: For me I love the style. The pink watch, for example, is a nice pop of color and a statement piece. But they serve as both. There are people who are obsessed with their watches. My husband is one of those people. Some men are watch connoisseurs. Kit: Were you familiar with TW Steel before you became a spokesperson?Rowland: I love big-faced watches so one day I took my best friend's TW Steel watch and wore it. The next thing I knew we were being introduced to the TW Steel family. The Kelly Rowland Canteen Bracelet Special Edition watch by TW Steel Kit: Are you already getting other ideas for future designs?Rowland: Yes, I want to make him (points to pregnant belly) a baby version of TW Steel. I'm actually bothering them about that now! Kit: He's not even born yet, but already he's influencing you! What other ways are you being inspired by him?Rowland: In shopping for my baby boy, I'm noticing the girl section has way more stuff than boys. So down the road, I'll be definitely designing some really cool stuff for little guys. Kit: Anything for yourself?Rowland: I love lashes, so I'm in the process of starting a make-up line, beginning with lashes. When you look at someone, you go straight to their eyes - the window to the soul. Lashes are another moment in beauty that needs to be expressed. My make-up artist and I are putting that forth.Kit: How has your personal style changed over the years?Rowland: When you're young you tend to throw something on to be cool or to fit in with a trend, when you should just really wear it for you. Style is something you feel. It's about not allowing something to wear you - you have to wear it. That knowledge comes with age. But I've always been daring when it comes to style. I'm not afraid to try something new.Kit: This is your first pregnancy. What's your pregnancy style?Rowland: I like things to be fitted so I haven't strayed away from that. I like my fitted dresses with cute boots or heels. I still like to feel sexy. When I'm at home I like to be comfortable so I'll wear a huge muumuu. But as far as dressing up, I want to feel like a woman. There's no better time to feel like a woman than now!Kit: What's happening on the music front for you these days?Rowland: It's still in development. I've been in the studio going through all these different songs and styles, and been inspired by different things. I go to art openings and concerts. If I buy on iTunes, I love the fact that there is a little blue diagram to say, if you like this you'll love this. It's about turning myself on to something new.Kit: You've worked on numerous reality shows including The X-Factor U.K. and U.S. What was your motivation for getting involved?  Rowland: It was about mentorship and getting back to the beginning. Sometimes you have this moment to where you're like, what was my beginning like? Then you think about all that knowledge that you've accumulated over the years. So it's about sharing a personal story with a contestant, or being inspired in that moment by them or being a support system. These people have dreams. If you can be a part in nurturing that and hopefully making it come to life, that's a gift.Kit: Did you find the talent pool different in different parts of the world?  Rowland: Other than having an accent, they were all hungry. They all had a dream. They all wanted to be stars. They all had to figure out I they wanted to be famous or if they wanted to leave an impression with their talent. Kelly Rowland on the red carpet for her TW Steel watch launchKit: Having seen close women friends in your circle having kids and being changed by motherhood, are you excited to see what it will be like for you?  Rowland: I'm really, really excited to see that. I've watched the way they've all changed as a family, as women and how with the baby there is this shift mentally that happens. I can't wait for that.Kit: Are there projects you are setting up to do further down the line once you have the baby and settle in to a new routine of motherhood?Rowland: There's an acting role that I'm eying right now. I can't say what it is because I'd rather not jinx it. But I really want this one specific role. It has my name all over it. I just have to pop this baby right out and get prepared for it in order for it to come to life. (laughs)"

Rescue crews searching off Jamaica's coast on Saturday said they could no longer see debris spotted earlier, stymieing efforts to solve the mystery surrounding a small plane carrying a prominent upstate New York couple that went on a ghostly 1,700-mile journey after the pilot was apparently incapacitated. Jamaican officials said that possible wreckage from the single-engine turboprop Socata TBM700 was sighted Friday evening by a military aircraft flying off the island's northeast coast, drifting roughly 24 miles off the coastal town of Port Antonio.

Neither debris nor bodies had been recovered by Saturday night, authorities said.""We would have to assume that the debris sank because we didn't find it at the surface,"" Jamaica Coast Guard Commander Antonette Wemyss-Gorman said at a news conference on Saturday.The Jamaica Defense Force ""conducted searches overnight and this morning in same location where they spotted an oil spill,"" she said.The crash site is believed to be about 14 miles (22 km) north of the coastal town of Port Antonio.Two people aboard the plane are believed to have been killed: Larry Glazer, a real-estate executive from Rochester, New York; and his wife, Jane Glazer. It is not yet known if anyone else was on the plane.""We have been in contact with the family, and we're keeping them updated,"" said Elizabeth Lee Martinez, chargé d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Kingston. She declined to give more information.The pilot stopped responding to radio calls about an hour after take-off from Greater Rochester International Airport and was headed to Naples Municipal Airport in Florida, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration reported.The Glazers were known to jet between homes in Rochester and Naples, local media reported.As the plane veered off course and flew away from Florida, it was trailed by U.S. fighter jets that halted their escort as it entered Cuban airspace, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said.NORAD suggested on its Twitter page that the aircraft's pilot may have suffered ""possible hypoxia,"" a rare condition caused by a loss of cabin pressure that may have left everyone on board unconscious.

Chiquita, owner of the namesake banana label, said it will continue with its planned purchase of Irish competitor Fyffes after rejecting an unsolicited $611 million takeover proposal from Cutrale Group and Safra Group. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb312c52100006401c7afc7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Banana giant Chiquita Brands International’s plan to move to Ireland to dodge U.S. taxes may be in trouble.Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential firm that advises investors, urged shareholders to vote against Chiquita’s plan to merge with Irish rival Fyffes. Instead, the company should accept a joint takeover bid by two Brazilian firms, ISS said in an analysis on Friday.Chiquita rejected the $625 million offer from orange juice behemoth Cutrale Group and investment bank Safra Group last month, and reaffirmed its plan to create the world’s largest banana company by merging with Fyffes. The combined company, dubbed ChiquitaFyffes PLC, would be headquartered in low-tax Ireland.Charlotte, N.C.-based Chiquita could face boycotts over its plan to split to Ireland in the so-called tax inversion deal. Tax inversions occur when a larger American company merges with a smaller foreign firm and moves overseas to skirt U.S. corporate taxes, which are among the highest in the world. The tactic, which has become increasingly popular over the last year, is facing intense political backlash as several high-ranking senators and the White House are exploring legal options to make inversions more difficult.Under the threat of a national boycott, drugstore chain Walgreen abandoned its plan last month to re-incorporate in Switzerland after merging with European rival Alliance Boots. Late last month, Burger King announced a deal to buy doughnut and coffee chain Tim Hortons and move to Canada. A similar chorus of voices called for boycotts against Burger King, though it remains unclear whether activists can organize enough customers to protest the fast-food giant. Still, ISS said investors’ excitement over Chiquita’s tax inversion deal, first announced in March, has waned in recent months. “The apparently declining market enthusiasm for the transaction over the months after the announcement,” the advisory firm wrote in its analysis, “and the potential to realize greater economic value through an alternative transaction -- as demonstrated by a higher cash offer from another potential strategic buyer -- suggest support for the transaction as currently structured is not warranted.” Steve Himes, a spokesman for Chiquita, did not respond to the The Huffington Post's request for comment on Sunday.
