I spoke with many devastatingly young men and women that day, in wheelchairs, with crutches or canes, with scars and burns.I remembered Derek because of his broad shoulders and fresh, baby face, as well as his mother who shared my first name, another Siobhan who lived with a lifetime of mispronunciation. Derek had ""the map of Ireland on his face"" -- red-haired, fair-skinned, smattering of freckles, a mischievous look in his eyes. On July 23, 2011, on patrol in Kandahar, Afghanistan, Derek was struck by an improvised explosive device while trying to rescue a fellow soldier. He lost his left leg from the hip and the right leg just above the knee and received blast wounds, including a fractured right arm, a skull fracture and kidney damage. A year and a half later, while I was chatting with his mom, he was doing wheelies in his wheelchair and joking around with his glossy-haired fiancé in the hospital foyer. His mother told me a little about Derek's ongoing recovery, the thirty-three surgeries, transfusions, dialysis. His vitality and pluck stayed with me, but I was haunted by this other Siobhan, this woman about my age, her ready smile and capable attitude. From New Jersey, she had moved to Maryland and utterly dedicated herself to her son's recovery. I was pregnant at the time with a four year old at home, and I couldn't imagine finally handing a child over to adulthood, having vigilantly gotten him that far, safe and whole, and then to have him return to me wounded, missing limbs, needing to learn to walk again. On March 18, 2013, scanning my Facebook feed, I read that Derek had died at Walter Reed. The young man who had fought again and again couldn't fight the impossible odds anymore. And then there is one of my husband's closest friends, Captain KJ Smith, who my husband knew since he was 14. I remember meeting KJ while bartending one very busy night at my father's Irish pub. He was off to the side, waiting patiently as thirsty customers waved money in the air and I slung pints and brimming wine glasses. He stood above everyone else, exuding the contained physical power of a star athlete, with thick black eyebrows and eyes wide with kindness when we finally shook hands. KJ had given up soccer scholarships to go to West Point and worked doggedly to join that long gray line. He was planning to propose to his girlfriend on mid-tour leave when he died in Baghdad on December 8, 2005, his humvee hit by an IED. When I see the Memorial Day photos of Arlington, row upon row of engraved names, I know those simple white markers and small fluttering American flags represent the entire lives of men and women like Derek McConnell and KJ Smith. Young, healthy, strong, willing to go places most of us don't even Google. They are the boys running across a soccer field, the kid bagging your groceries, the high-schooler getting straight As in science, the girls playing varsity volleyball, every one of them somebody's child who had an entire life of promise ahead. They are our own children in a couple of years.Please remember them this Memorial Day."

I'm looking for a good primary care doctor or internist for my elderly parents, and need to locate a good orthopedic doctor for me. --Shopping for DoctorsDear Shopping, Thanks to the Internet, finding and researching doctors is a lot easier than it use to be. Today, there's a wide variety of websites you can turn to that provide databases of U.S. doctors, their professional medical histories, and ratings and reviews from past patients on a number of criteria. Here are some of the best sites available, along with a few additional tips that can help you find the right doctors.Locating Tips To help you locate some doctors in your area, a good first step, and one that doesn't require a computer, is to ask for a referral. Contact some other doctors, nurses, or health care professionals that you know, for some names of doctors or practices that they like and trust. You should also call your insurance provider, or visit their website directory to get a list of potential candidates. If you or your parents are Medicare beneficiaries, you can use the Physician Compare tool at medicare.gov/physiciancompare. This will let you find doctors by name, medical specialty or by geographic location that accept original Medicare. You can also get this information by calling Medicare at 800-633-4227. Once you find a few doctors, you need to call their office to verify that they still accept your insurance, and if they are accepting new patients. Research Tools After you find a few doctors you're interested in, there are lots of online resources you can turn to, to help you check up on them.For example, you can find out if a doctor is board certified at the American Board of Medical Specialties or call 866-275-2267. And to learn about malpractice claims and disciplinary actions taken against doctors, you can use your state medical board to search your state. Here are some other good websites that can help you find and/or research doctors in your area for free.Healthgrades.com: This comprehensive easy-to-use site provides doctor's information on education and training, hospital affiliations, board certification, awards and recognitions, professional misconduct, disciplinary action and malpractice records, office locations and insurance plans. It also offers a 5-star ratings scale from past patients on a number of issues like communication and listening skills, wait time, time spent with the patient, office friendliness and more. Vitals.com: Provides background information on doctor's awards, expertise, hospital affiliations, and insurance as well as patient ratings on measures such as bedside manner, follow-up, promptness, accuracy of diagnosis, and average wait time. There's also a patient comment section.RateMDs.com: Provides information on training as well as patient ratings on staff, punctuality, helpfulness and knowledge. Patients can also post questions and answers about doctors, and get doctor's ratings based on patient reviews.Look Up Tool: If you want to find out how many times a doctor did a particular service and what they charge for it, use the CMS/HHS Medicare Physician and Other Supplier Look-up Tool. AngiesList.com: If you don't mind spending a little money ($20/per year), Angie's List is a membership service that provides doctor reviews using an A through F scale. When reaching a doctor, it's wise to check out several of these sites so you can get a bigger sampling and a better feel of how previous patients are rating a particular doctor.

He said this could lead to other regulations for Canadian oil and gas companies.""I believe we've had some very serious discussions around the potential this (focus on methane) holds for oil and gas regs in general,"" said Rickford, following his meeting with Ernest Moniz and Pedro Joaquin Coldwell, the U.S. and Mexican energy secretaries, respectively.Monday's agreement would also enhance cooperation on technologies to capture and bury greenhouse gas emissions underground, Rickford said.

Dulce, says the girl repeatedly suspended for fighting. Christian is the name of the boy who draws anarchy symbols on his forearms. And Angel, the stereotypical ""student from hell,"" is the one who glares at me. Who rolls his eyes at me. It's Angel who tempts me to make it personal between me and him. Angel would die if he knew this, but I consider him one of my greatest successes as a teacher. It's the kind of success that teachers sometimes don't credit themselves for -- and the ones that keep us coming back to this job that burns you up like tissue paper, especially at the end of the year.Angel was court-ordered to attend my class. He glared at me when I registered him. Many teachers know that look. However, what I've learned from kids like Angel is that ""the mean mug,"" as they call it, is a front. Growing up in Texas, I've seen my share of bullsnakes. They look just like rattlesnakes, but they're not dangerous. When you scare them, they puff up to make themselves look as big as possible, hissing like crazy while simultaneously striking and moving backward. Angel was behaving just like a bullsnake.For years, I've fallen for this act. Gradually, with the help and model of the excellent teachers with whom I work, I've learned to calm down and lean on a standby: food. The fastest way around an attitude is also one of the oldest: offer food, particularly something sweet. For Angel, like many children in poverty, celebrations are rare, and those that involve big, colored confections even more so. On this night, one of my colleagues brought in a sheet cake from a previous party. Angel eyed the waves of piped white frosting, the beads of colored sugar sprinkled among plump mounds of fondant flowers, a tiny spark of longing flashing across his face so quickly that if you blinked, you'd miss it. I asked him if he wanted a piece. He stared, irritation simmering inside his brown eyes. ""Well, it's there if you want it,"" I said, walking away. When I came back, he'd gotten himself a corner piece and eaten it. ""Oh, good,"" I said. ""I'm glad you got some. But now you owe me. One page of writing for one piece of cake."" ""I ain't writing nothing,"" he said, smirking. Moments like these are a crossroads. And for many years, I chose the wrong way. The writer Sandra Cisneros taught me that the smirking is actually a way of hiding a frightened little person. She wrote that we are all the ages we've ever been, like rings in a tree or Russian nesting dolls. So what I was seeing was a kind of 3-year-old tantrum in front of me. To maintain my temper and teach myself to see and connect to the invisible child inside the big, often rude bodies of my teenagers, I use another kind of sugar: verbal honey. I call these irritated students ""sweet baby."" Using this endearment softens me and helps me remember that learning something from someone you don't really know is a vulnerable experience. ""Sweet baby, don't write, then. Tell me why the judge ordered you here."" He puffed up, telling me what a ""bad kid"" he was. As he talked, I noticed that the frosting had stained his teeth blue. ""Angel, if you can tell me all that, why don't you write it? I want to show it to a guy in my class who says everything I give him to read is stupid and not real. He'd love your story. Would you like a laptop, or paper and a pencil?"" The question startled him. ""A laptop, I guess,"" he said, his face registering a kind of shock at his own answer. As the computer booted up, I drew a few boxes on a piece of paper to give him a structure to begin writing from and walked away.To see a struggling student actually begin to take up the work is like watching a butterfly land. You have to see it sideways so you won't frighten it away. When I came back around toward the end of class, I saw that he had written nearly an entire page. ""You are a writer, Angel, I knew it."" I could see the beginnings of a smile on his face.""It was pretty easy,"" he said, tilting the screen toward me.What I read was rife with misspellings and barely intelligible sentences. But what I've learned about teaching is that you have to meet each student where they are, celebrate what they can do and show them a small success.""You have all kinds of stories inside you,"" I told him. He smiled. That smile meant that for a small moment, he believed that he could. That smile meant that he felt actual pride in himself. That he believed he mattered. That his words have meaning and he has value. As I left the school that night, I rolled down the windows in my car, cranked up my music and felt the euphoria that comes from closing a difficult sale. My job is about selling hope. And thank God, I'm not the only one. There are millions of teachers who sell the same kind of hope, who give students the same vision of success.So when you see students walk the stage at graduation this year, know that behind them is an invisible line of men and women who helped each one to buy hope for themselves and to bet on a future that needs their talent."

16,POLITICS,What Limbaugh's Attack On TPP Means For Its Republican Supporters,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rush-limbaugh-tpp_n_7428034.html,,2015-05-25,"NOVI, MI - MAY 3: Radio talk show host and conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh speaks at 'An Evenining With Rush Limbaugh' event May 3, 2007 in Novi, Michigan. The event was sponsored by WJR radio station as part of their 85th birthday celebration festivities. (Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fb7a210000d601c9702b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Conservative talk radio icon Rush Limbaugh slammed President Barack Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Friday, telling listeners, ""The odds are the United States is gonna take it in the shorts.""Limbaugh argued Republicans shouldn't do Obama any favors by helping him pass a secretive trade agenda that his own party does not support.""Republicans are providing the necessary push to get it passed, which kind of bothers me,"" Limbaugh said. ""Since it's an Obama deal, the odds are it isn't good. Since it's an Obama deal, the odds are the United States is gonna take it in the shorts, as we have on so much of the Obama agenda, both domestic and foreign policy.""A host of tea party groups have opposed Obama's trade agenda for months. But Limbaugh's entrance into the debate significantly disrupts Republican leaders' hopes of securing a deal with Obama by overriding objections from House Democrats, given the radio host's substantial influence over conservatives.A significant bloc of tea party Republicans has rejected granting Obama so-called fast track authority to streamline the approval of a major trade pact the administration is negotiating with 11 other nations. Fast track would strip Congress of the ability to filibuster or amend whatever deal Obama eventually reaches. Although the Senate passed a fast track bill late Friday evening, tea party Republicans and Democratic skeptics currently outnumber the legislation's GOP supporters in the House. ""It makes no sense for Republicans to bail Obama out on this,"" Limbaugh continued. ""It literally doesn't.""""Why in the world, when Obama's trade deal is flittering away by the wayside because his own party doesn't want it -- a trade deal that should not be authorized because nobody has seen it -- do all of a sudden Republicans come along to bail it out and essentially make it possible?"" he asked.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Republican leaders say the TPP will boost economic growth. Tea party conservatives claim it will undermine U.S. sovereignty, while liberal critics argue it will exacerbate income inequality and empower foreign corporations to attack important U.S. regulations.Limbaugh emphasized the extreme secrecy the administration has adopted in pursuing the president's trade agenda -- a critique typically launched by liberal opponents. Obama treats draft TPP texts as classified information, making it a crime for any lawmakers who have viewed the deal to share its details with constituents.""They would not allow any of this deal to be made public. Members of Congress, House and Senate, had to go to a private room to read it,"" Limbaugh said. ""They couldn't leave with their notes. They weren't allowed to tell anybody what they read. Jeff Sessions had a massive op-ed piece and floor speech in the Senate about this. It's a disaster, just on that basis alone. It's not how things happen in this country.""The conservative radio host differentiated himself from liberal critics of Obama's trade agenda by attacking Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), one of the most popular figures in progressive politics and an opponent of TPP. Limbaugh seemed to cite a bizarre hit piece in Politico that suggested Warren's opposition to Obama on trade was hypocritical. The Politico piece doesn't make sense. Warren's primary critique of Obama's trade agenda is that it will allow foreign corporations to sue the government to undermine U.S. laws and regulations. Politico noted that Warren was paid as an expert defending the U.S. government from a trade lawsuit launched by foreign corporations in 2000. The two positions are perfectly consistent. Limbaugh further differentiated himself from liberal critics by highlighting those concerns.""There's another reason the left, the Democrats, don't like it,"" Limbaugh said. ""They think that the Obama trade deal empowers evil corporations to sue things like the United Nations over EPA regulations and so [on]. They really hate it for that reason. "" "

The recent political campaign #BlackLivesMatters has in the span of three short words been able to articulate a claim that I tried to make in my book of over 100,000 words.As the nation begins to celebrate Memorial Day, an event that began in response to the mass mortality caused by the Civil War, I am reminded of the fact that many newly emancipated slaves died from disease and suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction, but their death was rarely acknowledged and often not even recorded. In my book, Sick From Freedom, I tried to document the pain and suffering of formerly enslaved people who had to bury their children because their was no food to feed them during the war. I tried to capture the feeling of despair when countless freed slaves begged the army, Northern reformers, and anyone who would listen for help when a smallpox epidemic ravaged through their communities. I tried to describe the unimaginable anguish that one black mother felt when there was no place to bury her dead child and she was afraid that the Union army, who liberated her, would leave her son's corpse on a wharf -- where she witnessed the bodies of other dead freed children gnawed on by rats. I told these grim stories in order to make formerly enslaved people's suffering and death visible within a historical memory of the Civil War that overlooked their plight. Despite my effort, many historians continue to see only white soldiers' suffering and death during the war. Each Memorial Day, they only commemorate their death in honor of reuniting the nation. But what about those who did not wear the Union blue or Confederate grey but died in the same war often alongside of white soldiers? How we might remember their death and suffering?The popular political moniker #BlackLivesMatter offers one refrain to this continuing erasure. #BlackLivesMatter aptly calls for what historian Nell Painter deems ""a fully loaded cost accounting"" of the deaths of black people during the Civil War. Rhetorically, #BlackLivesMatter exemplifies how the most powerful messages relating to both the past and present can be conveyed in only a few words. I am not the only historian who has recognized the power of this hashtag. Over the past year, many others have employed it in order to articulate a similar concern about the representation of black people in history. In her review of Martha Hodes' book, Mourning Lincoln, in The New York Times, Harvard historian Jill Lepore extolls Hodes for showing how #BlackLivesMatter in her study of the cultural responses to Lincoln's assassination. Meanwhile, a number of historians have taken the adage #BlackLivesMatter to remind the American public of how the legacy of slavery continues to shape and inform the current political moment. In the American Prospect, historians Daina Ramey Berry and Jennifer L. Morgan brilliantly traced how the death of Eric Garner and others are tied to the history of slavery. According to Berry and Morgan, slavery commoditized black people and made them valuable to the nation; yet when slavery ended, black people no longer had the same monetary value and thereby their lives no longer mattered. #BlackLivesMatter became a way for Berry and Morgan to demonstrate how we continue to ""live in the embedded afterlife of slavery."" Similarly in the immediate aftermath of the Ferguson protests, historian Erica Armstrong Dunbar insightfully likened the pain that Leslie McSpadden, the mother of Michal Brown, experienced to enslaved women who ""lost child after child to a system that considered their offspring disposable property.""The campaign #BlackLivesMatter has enabled many historians to not only remind the American public of the violent history of enslavement in the United States but to also capture the political sentiment and ideological commitment that has driven the last fifty years of scholarship on slavery and make it more visible to the American public. Like much of African-American history, the mantra #BlackLivesMatter reveals how theories and knowledge about Black history emerged from political struggles; some of the most astute and trenchant critiques of history developed first within black communities and then eventually made their way into the academy. Unlike other forms of knowledge production that emanate from the ivory tower and then dissipate to the mainstream public, concepts propelling African-American history often began on the streets and then eventually (or not) make their way into the academy. As the nation celebrates Memorial Day, let us not forget that #BlackLivesMatter, and that the present can define the past. --Jim Downs is the author of Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction (Oxford University Press, 2012).

The measure would allow the Obama administration to conclude negotiations with 11 other Pacific Rim nations and bring a trade accord to Congress for an up or down vote, with lawmakers not permitted to make changes.

The Senators who flipped had obtained other concessions, on issues like the Export-Import Bank and currency manipulation - but tellingly most of the concessions were promises to let something be voted on, not commitments to pass them.The Senate vote passed the bill Friday night, the process proved far more difficult than expected and prospects in the House were even more challenging.The debate thus far represents a seismic change in the trade conversation. Now the argument is not about whether to incorporate labor and environmental standards. This year's the debate is about the fundamentals -- are the kinds of trade agreements we have been negotiating good for the country at their core?Four new dynamics are shaping this debate.1. Fast Track has become a transparent Executive Branch power grab -- angering even pro-business conservative Republicans.Fast track's original premise was that Congress would tell the Administration what its broad limits were -- what features must or must not be included. If the agreement met those standards, Congress would vote it up or down. Congress would not second guess, say, a Japanese concession on rice in exchange for a U.S. concession on auto parts.But as trade agreements tilted further and further away from the center of public opinion, Congress began setting side-bars that negotiators couldn't -- or didn't want -- to deliver. So the Bush Administration made the Congressional limits advisory only, not binding. Now fast track basically says anything the Administration negotiates is exempt from Congressional amendment --even provisions Congress and the public would never have supported.But this reality had to be concealed from the public. So trade negotiators stopped allowing public release of the terms of the agreements they were negotiating -- fearing that if the public and Congress knew what was in a deal being worked out, opposition would increase. (Indeed, Ron Kirk, the first Obama Trade Rep, was blunt: if the text of the treaty was made public, it could never be approved.)Members of Congress had to be allowed to see the documents. But they were told that it was illegal for them to share what they learned with the public. When Senator Barbara Boxer started to take notes the guard told her she could not -- or if she did, she had to surrender them. ""Not on your life,"" Boxer retorted, and kept her notes.Republican Jeff Sessions went further. He laid out a five page memo directly (and apparently illegally) quoting from the draft text he had seen, slamming in particular the provisions of the pending agreement that allow the President and other countries to change its membership and terms without Congressional approval -- in effect a permanent blank check to the White House.2. Concerns about climate highlights the reality that how goods are produced does not just impact the countries where production takes place.One of the core principals of the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement was that importing countries could not set worker, health or environmental standards for goods coming into their markets. This was always a misguided theory - pollution, for example, does not respect national boundaries. (Or even oceans -- in some seasons a quarter of the sulfate pollution in the Western US is emitted from factories in China making goods for export.)But carbon pollution is a truly global problem. Climate changes impacting Africa today is a result of carbon emitted by the U.S. and Europe over the last century. As more and more nations move towards carbon pricing as a part of the solution -- by 2016 50 percent of the world's fossil fuels will pay a carbon price -- nations won't allow their competitors to undercut their prices by refusing to levy such prices. Requiring a level playing field in international trade is an idea whose time is coming -- and perhaps may already have come.3. Current trade doctrine shrinks the space for democracy. Public opinion has less and less influence over drug pricing, health and environmental standards, food safety, anti-trust and banking regulation. One good sign is that the myth that we are arguing about free trade is gone. Listen to the editorial Board of the New York Times, traditionally one of the staunchest advocates of trade agreements:The important thing to remember about the Pacific and European trade deals is that they are not primarily about lowering customs duties and quotas. While these deals would reduce those barriers to trade, they would have much of their impact by getting countries to adopt similar regulations in areas like labor standards, environmental protection, how governments treat foreign investors and patent and copyright law.Indeed, only five of the 29 chapters of the draft agreement cover what most of us think of as trade -- tariffs, quotas, customs barriers.The current international trade regime allows foreign companies exclusive and preferential access to secret trade courts, in which they can (and will) argue that passage of tougher pollution standards unfairly reduces their expected profits, that regulations limiting the ability of publicly guaranteed banks to take risks is unduly conservative, or that requirements that drug companies permit the production of generic versions of their products after a reasonable tie are an expropriation of their intellectual property.4. Finally, too much evidence is in from past trade agreements. They have not been not good for the average American, have slowed growth and significantly contributed to increasing inequality. Since NAFTA and the free trade agreement with Korea, U.S. trade deficits with ""free trade"" partners have increased by 430%; However, over the same period, deficits with non-free trade countries declined by 11%! Korea alone, in the first three years of ""free trade"" saw a jump of 84 percent in our trade deficit, costing 85,000 jobs. These trade deficits are huge job and growth destroyers -- cutting growth by about $10 billion every month, $120 billion each year. The impact of trade agreements has been particularly deleterious for blue-collar, manufacturing employment. Senator Sessions, in his briefing, points out ""Labor economist Clyde Prestowitz attributes 60 percent of the U.S.' 5.7 million manufacturing jobs lost over the last decade to import-driven trade imbalances."" In the case of Korea, the Bush Administration promised that the agreement would open Korea's markets to US car makers. Instead US auto imports grew ten times as fast as exports to that country.Again from the normally pro-trade NY Times: ""There is also mounting evidence that the benefits of globalization have accrued disproportionately to upper-income households, while the costs have fallen heavily on the less affluent, contributing to the rise of economic inequality.""Why do we keep signing such deals? Does our governments really not know these facts? Well, Obama does, as he revealed when he chose to make his appeal for Fast Track at Nike, a company which has outsourced all of its manufacturing jobs to other countries, instead of New Balance, the one shoe maker still producing significantly in the U.S. In his speech at Nike, Obama boasted of how free trade helped Nike grow its market share -and hence hire more designers and marketers. This is yet another case of upscale knowledge workers benefiting while blue collar, middle class employment shrinks. But for the Administration and fast track advocates, that's the American future - our traditional blue-collar middle class just can't hope to compete with manufacturing workers making $1/hour in Vietnam, so they will have to take whatever service jobs the economy generates. German, of course, demonstrates that you can have a high wage, high skill manufacturing economy in a globalized world -- but you have to make it a priority. Germany protects its middle class, not its banks and pharmaceutical companies, when it negotiates trade deals -- the U.S. throws manufacturing under the bus.Harold Meyerson summed it up in the Washington Post, pointing out that the best argument the Wall Street Journal could muster for the U.S.-Korea trade agreement was that it had been good for US law firms and investors. No wonder, Meyerson muses, that the entire base of the Democratic Party is opposing Obama on fast track -- why does Obama seem perplexed?With these four new trump cards on the table, the odds against fast-track get better -- and almost certainly the next Presidential election will put the candidates of both parties to the test -- a fact which has led Hilary Clinton to distance herself from her husband's trade legacy, and Mike Huckabee to make opposition to trade deals one of his key planks.Trade diplomacy's House of Cards looks ever shakier -- even if it doesn't topple in the next few months."
19,SCIENCE,What It Was Like To Glimpse John Nash's Beautiful Mind,"Maurice Ewing, Ph.D., ContributorWrites about the mental hangups that hamper success",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-it-was-like-to-glimpse-john-nashs-beautiful-mind_b_7437306.html,"John Nash was a legend. He simply looked at things differently. He taught me that even geniuses need other people to correct their thinking and vet their ideas. Most importantly, however, Nash taught me that anyone's mind can be beautiful if it focuses on producing beautiful ideas.",2015-05-25,"Princeton University professor John Nash poses on the university's campus in Princeton, N.J. Oct. 11, 1994. Nash was named the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in economics. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baec8ba2200003401db0f58.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While finishing my dissertation at Princeton, I had the distinct pleasure of taking a seminar with John Nash. If you've read the book or seen the movie, A Beautiful Mind, you'll know that Nash suffered from schizophrenia and this seminar was one of his first appearances since having brought that mental ailment under control.Not knowing what to expect, most of us signed up just for the opportunity to spend time with Nash. He was a legend. Though we'd seen him as a shadowy figure that often lurked around Firestone library with a stack of paper scribblings, none of us ever spoke to him and we were curious about what a true genius might actually say.Strangely enough, that didn't make everyone on the faculty happy. I remember one game theorist telling me that taking Nash's seminar would be a ""distinct waste of time"". That was an ironic comment since Nash essentially ""invented"" game theory -- non-cooperative game theory, in particular.Non-coop game theory is the study of how individuals or institutions might interact strategically if they don't communicate and Nash won the 1994 Nobel Prize for presenting the first, stable solution to such a situation. If you loved the films, The Usual Suspects or LA Confidential, for example, those plots demonstrated non-cooperative game theory in its great, Hollywood form. Surprisingly, however, Nash didn't speak about non-coop game theory. Instead he presented the work he'd been doing on cooperative game theory. Coop-game theory is about how groups of individuals might enforce behaviour to achieve certain outcomes. Just about every spy movie with a dastardly syndicate influencing its members involves coop theory.Yet, what made Nash's presentation amazing was his sharp mind and wit. He simply looked at things differently. His whole approach involved painting a picture of an idea -- not simply stating a few results. Having not presented anything publicly in nearly 50 years, some complained that his work failed to connect with the recent direction of the literature and didn't seem to have a point. That seemed like dismissive jealousy to many of us, since what Nash presented was simply fresh, true and relevant to the real world.After the presentation, our group went to a small room with Nash for cookies and a discussion. Of course, while Nash wanted to talk about his results and possible extensions, we all wanted to know about his life and how he came to be ""Nash"". That made him noticeably uncomfortable, so the group of us became a bit clever and started asking Nash questions that we hoped would reveal his genius.I asked him who had influenced his choice of dissertation topic and he said, no one. Another person wondered whether Nash's work was accepted readily by people around the mathematics department at the time and Nash said, no. Finally, we hit the jackpot when I asked Nash how his model could explain the politics of the world we currently see.All of a sudden, this 70-something year old man stood up and spoke to us with a 20-something year old's energy. He started illustrating the interesting point that powerful, cooperative relationships actually stem from the lack of power, not from the possession of it. Enforcing the rules of a coalition was really about playing on the fears and insecurities of other members.All of that made a sort of counterintuitive sense to us. It made me think, for example, about Hitler's rise to power and his ability to create alliances with the leadership of ""seemingly nice countries"". In school, we were taught that most of these countries fell under Hitler's sway for fear Nazi invasion. Nash's model, however, suggested that insecurity was what might have motivated the Axis powers.While we pondered Nash's ideas, what further amazed us was his humility and hunger for intellectual interaction, even with us lowly graduate students. He spoke to us as colleagues and invited us to validate his thinking. He also encouraged us when he believed we were on the right track, and gently corrected us when we got things wrong.I was definitely the dumbest person in the room and felt especially fortunate to interact with him in this way. At one point, when he complimented me on something I said, I remember thinking, ""A genius has just said he likes the way I think -- I gotta' tell my boys at home about this!""Like all good things, our time with Nash eventually came to an end. I doubt that he took much away from us, but we definitely took a great deal away from him.Nash taught me, for example, that brilliant ideas are not the exclusive domain of people with great minds; yet it's hard to imagine many people deserving the title ""great"" without brilliant ideas.Nash taught me that we thinkers are no less artistic and creative in our ideas than the greatest of artists, unless we choose to be so. Nash taught me that even geniuses need other people to correct their thinking and vet their ideas (as he had done in interacting with Von Neumann).Most importantly, however, Nash taught me that anyone's mind can be beautiful if it focuses on producing beautiful ideas. --Maurice Ewing is a globally-experienced risk and strategy consultant that has worked in over 50 countries.

Surely our present era of appreciation is an improvement over that era of disrespect, right? And how do we show our support for the ones who get killed? We hold wrenching funerals, presenting their bereft ones with a folded American flag. When there are enough of them killed, and enough survivors to ache for them, we turn to our country's history of commemorating the dead in cemeteries, in town squares, on the walls of sacred places. We build memorials.One such memorial is in the center of Harvard Yard, and I recently spent some time there.Where loyalty liesI happened to enter Memorial Church when an organist was practicing. This space of soaring columns and lofty ceiling is filled with light, the pews freshly painted and the crimson cushions recently upholstered. On the wall to my right were engraved the names of those Harvard men who perished in World War II. They are listed by class year, beginning with the class of 1904. For that first year there are only two names, the second of which is Franklin Delano Roosevelt. (He died when the war was still going on, I reminded myself, while Commander in Chief.) Then the class years continue, with the number of names increasing as the years march into the 1930s and '40s. As I contemplated the names so neatly carved, the beautiful music rising, I thought of the parents of these men with engraved names who had sat where I was sitting. Of them gazing up at the name of their son, then back at their hands, up at the pulpit, down at their shoes. I imagined their ears filling with music as mine were. How did they reconcile the blackness of their loss with the beauty of the architecture and music? The class of 1948 is the last year listed, and it has four names: Richard Webster Boyden,Thornton Hunt Lyttle, Joseph Silverstein, Frank Suvla Vickers. These youngest of Harvard's World War II soldiers were scheduled to return for another three years of college. What was commencement day 1948 like for these men's parents? Were they invited? If so, did they come?Next come the names from the professional schools. There are many for the law school and business school. For the divinity school, there are but two. One is Edgar Raymond Attebery. The other is listed like this: Adolf Sannwald (enemy casualty)Adolf must have come from Germany to attend the divinity school and returned to serve his country. Was there a debate about whether to include him? And if so, whether to include the parenthetical note? It turns out the matter had come up before. Memorial Church was actually built to commemorate World War I. This I learned from a video that Harvard's late Rev. Prof. Peter J. Comes produced. He explains that the building was dedicated on Armistice Day (what we now call Veterans' Day) in 1932. In the nave of the church is a brass plaque engraved in Latin with the message, ""Harvard has not forgotten its sons who under opposite colors also gave their lives to their countries."" There was, indeed, a controversy about whether to include the German names, but in the end, it was decided that Harvard's first loyalty should be to its students. And so the names were commemorated, although not in the same place or style. And the band plays onAs a father and a 60-year-old who has witnessed from afar my country's wars, I rail against the waste of it. Yet I have also felt the brass of the bugle and the wool of the uniform. As a youth, I was a trumpet player and played reveille, charge, and, on Memorial Day, taps. I still remember the pride I felt wearing my first band uniform at Lemon Grove Junior High in San Diego, California, and especially my high school uniform, an imitation of the Scottish Guard's, at Helix High in La Mesa. We played the British Eighth and Colonel Bogey marches, we drilled, we polished our shoes to a spit-shine. All of this, of course, was an imitation of fighting units. When we marched, if non-band members had the poor judgment to mess with us by entering our ranks, we would shove them and kick them to make sure they would pay a price for daring to interfere with our machine-like precision. When our older son Cal was four years old, Lori and I took him with us to the Copenhagen furniture fair and stopped to have some fun at Tivoli Gardens. When Cal saw the famed Tivoli Guards, who are boys, dressed in toy-soldier red and white uniforms, he was mesmerized. For the first time in his young life, Cal ran away from his parents, running faster than I'd ever seen him, to catch up with those marching, miniature soldiers. What is it about uniforms, marching bands and marshal music, that we find so acutely appealing? Paying tributeI have visited the memorial built above the remains of the Arizona in Pearl Harbor and stood in silence to honor those who were silenced that December day. I have visited Gettysburg and choked up when I read the Gettysburg Address and surveyed that broad field filled with those who gave their last full measure of devotion.With my father, my sons and my wife, I have visited the American Cemetery at Normandy, all of us walking among the endless snow-white headstones and perfectly trimmed grass. My father was shipping over to the Pacific when World War II ended. (He's in the photo below, far right, with his Navy buddies in the Philippines, shortly after V-J Day in 1945.) Had the timing been slightly different, none of us might have been walking Normandy that fine French day. Of all the war memorials I've visited, the one that disturbs me the most is the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C. As I descend down the ramp of Maya Lin's creation, and feel the names of men and women rising up over my knees, then my waist and then my head, and finally over my head, I feel like I am being buried with them. In the polished marble I see my ghost-like reflection, and wonder why.I am not a pacifist. There are things worth fighting for, perhaps even things worth letting our sons and daughters fight for. But I have lived to see too many ill-conceived wars and remained silent. I am not proud of this. In 1972 when I graduated from high school, I received my draft number, but like my father, I got lucky. Nixon resigned in disgrace and the Vietnam War ended with our hasty retreat before I could be shipped over. I wasn't put to the test of serving, or refusing to serve, as those just slightly older than me were. And so I could remain silent, and did, speaking neither with my words nor my deeds. Yet many intrepid men and women had spoken out against the war, and that helped it end sooner.On this Memorial Day, I pay tribute to those who have served our country in uniform, and also to those who have spoken up against doing so when they believed our leaders were wrong. We need both kinds of brave souls if our war memorials are to have the one thing we all wish they had in common: extreme old age. "

As I descend down the ramp of Maya Lin's creation, and feel the names of men and women rising up over my knees, then my waist and then my head, and finally over my head, I feel like I am being buried with them. In the polished marble I see my ghost-like reflection, and wonder why.I am not a pacifist. There are things worth fighting for, perhaps even things worth letting our sons and daughters fight for. But I have lived to see too many ill-conceived wars and remained silent. I am not proud of this. In 1972 when I graduated from high school, I received my draft number, but like my father, I got lucky. Nixon resigned in disgrace and the Vietnam War ended with our hasty retreat before I could be shipped over. I wasn't put to the test of serving, or refusing to serve, as those just slightly older than me were. And so I could remain silent, and did, speaking neither with my words nor my deeds. Yet many intrepid men and women had spoken out against the war, and that helped it end sooner.On this Memorial Day, I pay tribute to those who have served our country in uniform, and also to those who have spoken up against doing so when they believed our leaders were wrong. We need both kinds of brave souls if our war memorials are to have the one thing we all wish they had in common: extreme old age. "

The best-selling author praises her classics The House of Mirth, The Custom of the Country, and The Age of Innocence, but grossly misreads her character and her life.Franzen has the nerve to harp on Wharton's appearance: ""Edith Wharton might well be more congenial to us now if ... she'd looked like Grace Kelly or Jacqueline Kennedy."" Seriously? Wharton Society President Emily Orlando says reading his piece reminded her of the late Louis Auchincloss's bizarre report that some people thought Wharton ""would've given all her novels to be beautiful."" But guess what else irks Franzen? Wharton wasn't charming.  Oh, the humanity! How could any woman sink so low?For Franzen, though, Wharton's gravest sin was something far more despicable: Edith Wharton was rich. And who can sympathize with someone who traveled in style and owned several houses? Without sympathy, Franzen insists that ""whether for the writer or for the fictional character, a work of fiction has a very hard time mattering."" (Based on this article of Franzen's, I find him very unsympathetic. Does that mean his novels don't matter? But I digress....)Franzen offers readers a shallow examination of Wharton's life. He falsely makes her sound like she was born to massive wealth when she actually came from Old New York money, which was modest compared with the wealth of Gilded Age tycoons. Even though she was financially independent in her early 20s thanks to an inheritance, she wasn't remotely in the league of J.P. Morgan, the Astors, or the Vanderbilts--which all her biographers have carefully pointed out. Wharton's literary earnings are what supported her grand lifestyle. The House of Mirth sold 150,000 copies the year it came out and was a national bestseller, and the 1905 income from all her writings -- adjusted for inflation -- would be well over $4 million today. She enjoyed spending her money as it came in. What's wrong with that? Complaining about her living large makes Franzen sound puritanical as well as sexist.Edith Wharton's Lenox, Massachusetts, homeFranzen also seems to know very little about Wharton's psychology. In Edith Wharton's Prisoners of Prisoners of Shame, I wrote about Wharton growing up with a profound sense of inferiority. She felt deeply humiliated by being the awkward, shy, unattractive daughter of a woman reputed to be the best dressed woman in New York. This legacy of shame stamped itself on her and her work: Throughout Wharton's fiction you can find scenes of public and private humiliation. It's an unmistakable drumbeat, but Franzen is deaf to it. All he can hear is the chink of gold and the roar of her fancy chauffeur-driven cars. Is he envious? Wharton was a heroic philanthropist -- but Franzen just doesn't care. As her most recent biographer Hermione Lee puts it, for four years ""she sacrificed much of her life as a writer and a private citizen"" doing indefatigable work for Belgian refugees during World War I. Wharton was awarded the decoration of ""Chevalier"" of the National Order of Legion of Honor by France, and the Medal of Queen Elizabeth by King Albert of Belgium. Mentioning that would spoil Franzen's out-of-kilter picture of a haughty heiress....Franzen apparently came to praise some of Wharton's books in The New Yorker but for some strange reason felt the need to bury her. Lev Raphael is the author of The Edith Wharton Murders and Rosedale in Love, a retelling of Wharton's The House of Mirth, and many other books that you can find on Amazon.

29,POLITICS,The Madness of THAAD,"John Feffer, ContributorDirector, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLog; Author ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-madness-of-thaad_b_7431472.html,Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) has not been demonstrated to work effectively. It pushes China and North Korea to spend more money on more missiles to overwhelm THAAD (just as the U.S. is moved to spend more money on missile upgrades to counteract the missile defense of other countries). And it is a poor substitute for arms-control negotiations.,2015-05-24,"The first of two Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptors is launched during a successful intercept test. The test, conducted by Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Operational Test Agency, Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense, and U.S. Pacific Command, in conjunction with U.S. Army Soldiers from the Alpha Battery, 2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment, U.S. Navy sailors aboard the guided missile destroyer USS Decatur (DDG-73), and U.S. Air Force airmen from the 613th Air and Operations Center resulted in the intercept of one medium-range ballistic missile target by THAAD, and one medium-range ballistic missile target by Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). The test, designated Flight Test Operational-01 (FTO-01), stressed the ability of the Aegis BMD and THAAD weapon systems to function in a layered defense architecture and defeat a raid of two near-simultaneous ballistic missile targets",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e69183e230000c715de0a6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In its annual spring ritual, the Pentagon brings its tin cup to Congress to beg for appropriations. Earlier this month, General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tried to explain to some bewildered members of Congress why the Pentagon required so much money when the United States already spends more than all its potential adversaries combined.U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a rather hawkish Democrat from California, balked at the request for $1.8 billion for a new nuclear-capable cruise missile that could strike targets 1,000 miles away. Her confusion was understandable. Early in his first term, Barack Obama became the first U.S. president to embrace nuclear disarmament. But the Pentagon continues to press for more nuclear weapons.In response to her question, Dempsey said that the missile was absolutely necessary. ""Air defenses are improving around the world,"" he said, and ""keeping that capability to penetrate air defenses with our nuclear deterrent is an important one.""The United States has probably the strongest nuclear deterrent in the world. It has many more nuclear weapons than it could conceivably need to deter other countries from foolishly imagining that they could attack America with impunity. And yet even the Pentagon argues that the air defenses of other countries -- missile defense -- could somehow weaken the U.S. ability to deter a missile attack.It shouldn't be that difficult for Dempsey to imagine his counterpart in Beijing making the same argument. In fact, his Chinese counterpart would have a much stronger argument to make. China has far fewer nuclear weapons and far fewer ballistic missiles than the United States. And the United States is the leading advocate of air defenses, particularly missile defense. So it's not difficult to understand why China is particularly upset that the United States is pushing its Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in northeast Asia.China is worried that a sufficiently robust missile defense system will lead the United States to believe that it could attack China with impunity. It's not a question of whether such a system could actually work in practice. The issue is one of perception. If the United States believes that THAAD works, it will feel less constrained about acting aggressively toward China.Back in the ""good old days"" of the Cold War, arms-control specialists understood that a missile defense race was just as bad as an arms race. If the United States and the Soviet Union began to pour money into what was then called ABM (anti-ballistic missile) sites, they would spur the other to increase spending on missiles to overwhelm those sites. They would then build more ABM sites. The two sides wisely concluded an ABM treaty in 1972 that limited the two sides to only one site each. The United States eventually withdrew from the treaty in 2002, the first major international arms treaty it abandoned.The missile defense genie is now out of the bottle, and many major powers are constructing their own systems. Even China has been developing a system similar to THAAD. The architects of the ABM treaty are now seeing their nightmares come true: a continued arms race compounded by an air defense race.The ostensible target of THAAD, however, is not China. The United States is urging its allies to adopt the system to guard against missiles launched by North Korea. At the moment, Japan and South Korea rely on Patriot missile defense -- PAC 2 and PAC 3 -- which guards against potential missile attacks at a lower altitude. THAAD would presumably defend against long-range missiles, including nuclear-tipped ones, though given the distances involved, the PAC systems seem more appropriate.North Korea's missile capabilities are certainly troubling. The recent test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile, even though a full working model is several years away, suggests that Pyongyang is not content to have just a couple of nuclear bombs to bolster its deterrence.But the way to address North Korea's nuclear and missile programs is to sit down and negotiate limits. Here, even THAAD advocates try to sound diplomatic. They argue that China will become so uncomfortable with the degradation of its own deterrent capability that it will pressure North Korea to return to the negotiating table. It seems, on the face of it, a clever argument.The problem is that North Korea rarely listens to China, particularly on military strategic issues. China has never been happy with North Korea's nuclear ambitions. It's very possible that Beijing is pursuing its own missile defense system as much to protect against what Pyongyang might do, deliberately or accidentally, as anything the United States has in mind.Right now, South Korea is divided on the issue, with the ruling party supporting THAAD and the opposition expressing skepticism. The debate may well come down to money, since THAAD is not cheap. In this case, the opposition's resistance will inadvertently help Park Geun Hye by providing her with a stronger argument that the United States should provide the system for free instead of pressuring South Korea into giving roughly $1 billion to military contractor Lockheed Martin for each THAAD battery.But THAAD is a waste of money, whoever is footing the bill. It has not been demonstrated to work effectively. It pushes China and North Korea to spend more money on more missiles to overwhelm THAAD (just as the United States is moved to spend more money on missile upgrades to counteract the missile defense of other countries). And it is a poor substitute for arms-control negotiations. Instead of letting Lockheed Martin determine the security politics of Northeast Asia, it's crucial to bring the diplomats back to the negotiating table to address the causes of insecurity and not just the symptoms.Originally published in Hankyoreh"

A rescue team washed oil off its coat and hydrated it, but the sea lion died early on Saturday, SeaWorld said in a statement.""It's always very saddening to our rescue team when an animal doesn't make it and often the situation is that the animal is past the point of being able to recover,"" said SeaWorld spokesman Dave Koontz.A necropsy is planned to determine the cause of death, according to SeaWorld.So far, two dolphins without visible signs of petroleum exposure have been found dead, Settle said, as have five petroleum-streaked pelicans and 50 invertebrates.Another surviving sea lion and an elephant seal were shipped to SeaWorld on Friday for recuperation, according to the park.Separately, wildlife workers have managed to keep alive nine pelicans and one western grebe that were streaked with oil, said Ashley Settle, a spokeswoman for the joint-agency command for cleanup and recovery.The full extent of the toll on wildlife has not been determined, and experts fear the oiled birds and marine mammals found to date may represent only the tip of a potential calamity.Plains All American Pipeline LP, the owner of the oil pipeline that burst, must take numerous corrective measures, including an in-depth analysis of factors contributing to the spill and a plan to fix any flaws found before they can restart the line, U.S. safety officials said on Friday.The spill was the largest to hit the ecologically sensitive shoreline northwest of Los Angeles since a massive 1969 blowout dumped up to 100,000 barrels into the Santa Barbara Channel.
