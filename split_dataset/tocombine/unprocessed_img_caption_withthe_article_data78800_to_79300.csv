The former U.S. secretary of state had 42 percent support, down from 52 percent in August, while Biden had 22 percent backing and Sanders 20 percent. Biden, who has not said yet said whether he will seek the candidacy, had 12 percent support last month.Biden's favorability rating rose to 71 percent from 67 percent to match Clinton's, compared with 41 percent for Sanders, the poll showed.The poll of 1,009 adults, including 339 voters who said they were Democrats or Democratic-leaning, was conducted from Aug. 31 to Sept. 2, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Those pesky women would be two college seniors, Tess Davison and Olivia Miller, who, with the approach of Hasty Pudding auditions for the spring semester, have signed up to try out for the group in defiance of the historic ban on female actors.As the rules stand, women are able to work behind the scenes in Hasty Pudding's writing team, business staff, tech crew or band.

The paper reports that many students feel ""women could easily dress up to play male characters ... without losing any comedic value."" In Hasty Pudding's defense, it would seem the group is pulling brave inspiration from other rare all-male troupes, like the Propeller theater company or literally any group performing prior to the 17th century.Davison and Miller are are fighting their exclusion by encouraging other Harvard women to sign up for Hasty Pudding's upcoming auditions (at least 17 have signed up so far). Acknowledging this, the group's president Robert T. Fitzpatrick told The Harvard Crimson that the prospect of adding women has become a ""topic of serious discussion,"" while noting that this would require “structural changes to the production, the company, and our larger institutional traditions.”It's unclear precisely what these structural changes would entail, but presumably linking the troupe's touring schedule with the cycle of the moon and hiring additional security to protect the cast members from bears would be among the precautions taken.Hasty Pudding has yet to respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.

4,POLITICS,Jeb Bush Wants To Double Down On His Brother's Tax Cuts For The Rich,Zach Carter and Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb-bush-tax-cuts_us_55f04f67e4b093be51bcf46b,The GOP candidate calls for massive breaks for the wealthiest Americans.,2015-09-09,<p>Jeb Bush's tax plan sounds like something his brother George would approve.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f050bd2c00002100aaf466.jpeg?cache=8nvedlAzA8&ops=crop_243_172_1754_1061%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush outlined a tax plan on Wednesday that broadly resembles the tax platform presented in 2000 by his brother George W. Bush. The main difference: Jeb would give even bigger tax breaks to the the ultra-wealthy. The current income tax rate on the wealthiest Americans is 39.6 percent, where it stood when Jeb's brother ran for president in 2000. At the time, George W. pushed to cut the top rate to 33 percent. Jeb would slash it to 28 percent -- almost one-third less than the current rate. Like his brother, Jeb Bush hopes to persuade other Americans to support his proposed boon for the rich by also providing tax breaks for people with lower incomes. Jeb says he would cut taxes for all families and, like his brother, provide expanded benefits for the poor. George W. vowed to double the child tax credit in 2000, while Jeb says he would expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, which helps the working poor.Sweetening the deal for the middle class, however, didn't change the fact that George W. Bush's platform was wildly skewed in favor of the wealthy. The nonpartisan nonprofit Citizens for Tax Justice wrote in May 2000 that about 60 percent of the tax cuts proposed by the Bush campaign would go to the richest 10 percent of taxpayers and 43 percent would accrue to the top 1 percent, while costing the U.S. Treasury $1.6 trillion.Jeb Bush's tax plan appears to have a broadly similar effect: tax cuts for most Americans, but most of the benefits flowing to the richest Americans. Jeb presents his plan as balanced across all income groups. He touts his proposal to end the carried interest tax loophole that benefits hedge fund and private equity managers as evidence that he would take on elite Wall Street interests. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have both backed similar proposals.But Jeb Bush would also give wealthy Americans a massive tax break by slashing their regular income tax rate, and grant Wall Streeters and others who make their money on securities a separate boon by cutting the capital gains tax rate -- which applies to profits from stocks, bonds and real estate. About half of all capital gains flow to the top 0.1 percent of households, according to The Washington Post. Bush proposes cutting the capital gains rate for the wealthiest Americans from 23.8 percent to 20 percent. Even with the massive cut to the top income tax rate, the top capital gains rate would remain lower -- a scenario that would continue to favor money earned from securities trading over traditional wages.On capital gains, Jeb shrugs off his brother's agenda for that of former Vice President Dick Cheney. As Barton Gellman details in Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency, when it came time to push the tax platform through Congress, Cheney outmaneuvered George W. Bush to secure an additional capital gains tax cut dramatically favoring the rich. Bush thought such a cut would be seen as a slap in the face to supporters who had believed his ""compassionate conservative"" campaign pitch, but Cheney won the legislative battle. The top rate on capital gains was (for some years) reduced from 20 percent to 15 percent, while the top rate on stock dividends was cut from 39.6 percent to 15 percent.Jeb Bush's plan also goes further than his brother's by pushing a hefty corporate tax cut, dropping the rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. Corporate tax cuts benefit wealthy Wall Street interests by boosting business profits and stock prices.Jeb Bush offers few details on how to pay for all that lost tax revenue. In addition to closing the carried interest loophole, he would cap overall deductions at 2 percent of adjusted gross income, limiting the number of breaks that wealthy families can take. But these changes would almost certainly not be enough to blunt the deficit impact of the tremendous tax cuts largely benefiting the rich. Mitt Romney was chastised by economists in 2012 for promising to cut the top income tax rate to 28 percent -- the same level Jeb Bush is proposing. Economists said that under Romney's plan, the only way to keep the deficit from ballooning would have been to raise taxes on middle- or low-income Americans."

The likelihood of leaders in both the House and Senate missing the Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government is looking more and more inevitable. Congress returned from summer recess on Tuesday, but lawmakers plan to tackle a resolution on the administration's Iran nuclear deal first, despite the looming cliff. Hoyer told reporters that he hopes leaders will be able to come to an agreement on a temporary continuing resolution to fund the government through Oct. 15, while they hammer out a long-term solution. Still, a handful of Republicans in the House have vowed to reject any agreement that continues to fund the family planning provider Planned Parenthood. Complicating matters further, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) is facing a coup from conservatives within his caucus who have threatened to try and oust him as speaker. Pressed on whether these issues will cause the House to stumble into a shutdown, Hoyer said ""no.""""I don't think there has been any surprise from the last 90 to 120 days of the problem that we are confronting,"" Hoyer said. ""If we shut down government, it will be because you have willful Republicans who are prepared to take the government hostage to attain their ends. It will not be a stumble; it will be a considered objective, and a number of them have said so publicly. That is not John Boehner's objective.""Both Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have said they want to negotiate with Democrats and prevent a shutdown, but efforts to defund Planned Parenthood could get in the way.Hoyer admitted the ""job is made much more difficult by internecine warfare within the Republican Party. Everybody sees how deeply divided the Republican Party is -- here in Congress and the presidential race.""He added that the majority of Democrats and Republicans in the House want to avoid a government shutdown and will have to ""confront the same kind of willful disregard for responsible government.""Still, he doesn't expect a ""major"" agreement in the next seven days -- the amount of time Hoyer estimates Congress will have to craft a short-term solution, given a busy September schedule that includes debate on the Iran deal and a visit from Pope Francis.  CORRECTION:  This story previously misstated that a temporary continuing resolution would fund the government through Oct. 1. In fact, it would provide funds until Oct. 15. "

A Monmouth University poll released Tuesday finds that Clinton's support has dropped to 42 percent among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters; at the same time, Biden's support has increased to 22 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is up 4 points and now sits closely behind Biden with 20 percent of the vote, placing the two in an essential tie, given the poll's 5.3 percent margin of error. The remaining Democratic candidates, Martin O'Malley, Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb, continue to struggle in the race, taking just 1 percent or less of the vote. The poll also finds that Biden and Clinton are equally liked among Democrats: 71 percent of Democrats rate them each favorably. Forty-one percent of Democrats rate Sanders favorably, while 45 percent still have no opinion of him. According to the HuffPost Pollster National Democratic chart, which aggregates all publicly available polls, Clinton continues to maintain a strong lead with 45 percent of the vote; Sanders is second with 23 percent and Biden now takes 17 percent. Biden's poll bump comes amid speculation that the vice president might jump in the race for the White House. Biden, who lost his oldest son to brain cancer earlier this year, says he is still considering whether he and his family have the ""emotional energy"" for a 2016 run. National polls 14 months before an election serve as poor predictors of the eventual outcome as most people surveyed aren't paying much attention this far out.Huffington Post data scientist Natalie Jackson tracked the attention paid in previous elections, and found that only a small portion of those surveyed this far out from Election day are actually tuned in. Monmouth University surveyed 1,009 U.S. adults and a subsample of 339 registered voters who are Democrats or lean Democrat using live interviewers over landline and cell phone Aug. 31 through Sept. 1.

She was also flanked by GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who has become one of her most vocal supporters.""She loves God, she loves people, she loves her work, and she will not betray any of those three,"" Staver told reporters outside the facility.U.S. District Judge David Bunning released Davis after five of her six deputies began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. (The lone holdout is Davis' son.) As part of her release, Bunning warned that Davis may not interfere with the duties of her deputy clerks.Asked by reporters on Tuesday whether Davis will comply with this condition, Staver said only that she ""cannot and will not violate her conscience.""Huckabee praised Davis for showing ""more courage than any politician I know"" and offered rhetorically to bear any punishment in her place.""If somebody needs to go to jail, I'm willing to go in her place,"" he said.The main event Tuesday, however, was a pro-Davis rally -- which had some marriage equality supporters counter-protesting as well. Huckabee and Staver quickly went to the staging area after leaving the detention center and greeted Davis' supporters.""Kim Davis is free!"" declared Huckabee to loud cheers.Another speaker followed the former Arkansas governor with prayer, proclaiming, ""We don't need the Supreme Court when we have the Supreme Being!""The climax of the event was an appearance by Davis herself, who walked out on stage to a sustained round of applause as the song ""Eye of the Tiger"" blasted through the speakers. Crying, she embraced Huckabee, who introduced her; lifted her arms into the air; and thanked God and her supporters alike.""We serve a living God who knows exactly where each and every one of us is. Just keep on pressing, don't let down. Because he is here,"" she said.Davis had been in jail since Thursday, when Bunning ordered her locked up until she complied with his order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. She argued that she could not do so because it ""irreparably and irreversibly violates her conscience."" Davis is a follower of Apostolic Christianity. Supporters of gay marriage have pointed out that she's hardly a model of ""family values,"" since she has been divorced three times.Staver said that Davis plans to return to work this week and that she has no intention of resigning despite the standing court order to issue marriage licenses to all couples. (Kentucky law largely shields an elected official like Davis from being forced out of her post.) Staver and his client are instead asking officials to remove her name and authority from the certificate.""She cannot allow her name to be associated with something that conflicts with God's definition of marriage,"" he said.Opponents of marriage equality are holding her up as a martyr for their cause. Huckabee, in particular, has been outspoken in her defense. On Sunday, he compared her stance to President Abraham Lincoln's fight against slavery.Kentucky gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin, a Republican, also tweeted out a photo with Davis -- which was photobombed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), another prominent Davis supporter.Cruz did not appear at the press conference with Huckabee, Staver and Davis. But it wasn't for his lack of trying. The New York Times reported that when Cruz ""exited the jail a throng of journalists beckoned him toward their microphones, but an aide to Mr. Huckabee blocked the path of Mr. Cruz, who appeared incredulous.""The U.S. Supreme Court struck down state bans on marriage equality on June 26.

9,POLITICS,Will The Ferguson Commission's Final Report Just Collect Dust On A Shelf?,Mariah Stewart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ferguson-commission-report_us_55e72aefe4b0aec9f3557584,"If it's like other famous commission reports, yes.",2015-09-08,Outrage In Missouri Town After Police Shooting Of 18-Yr-Old Man,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a920001300002c0093a1ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"ST. LOUIS -- In the summer of 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed the ""National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders"" to investigate and help prevent the spread of race riots that were happening across the country. At the time, unrest had already caused extensive damage and a number of fatalities.At the end of the seven months of work from the Kerner Commission, as it would come to be known, the 11 members came to one basic conclusion: “Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white -- separate and unequal.”Nearly 50 years later, history is repeating itself. After unrest embroiled the small town of Ferguson, Missouri, in the wake of the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager who was fatally shot by a white police officer, Gov. Jay Nixon (D) created the ""Ferguson Commission."" According to its website, its goal is to “guide the community in charting a new path toward healing and positive change for the residents of the St. Louis region.”On Sept. 9, the 16-member group is having its final meeting, and it will turn in its final report to Nixon by the end of the year. But if history proves true, it's likely the report will go relatively unnoticed and not effect any major change in the community.In the Kerner Commission's final report, the body made dozens of recommendations to state governments and the federal government, as well as to police departments, media outlets, workplaces and educational institutions. But despite the commission's work, Johnson did not act on its recommendations.Lindsey Lupo, a political science professor at Point Loma Nazarene University and the author of Flak-Catchers: One Hundred Years of Riot Commissions in America, said commissions tend to reduce the sense of urgency and “make it seem as though the government is responding.” “They end up depoliticized or bandaging the violence, rather than actually dealing with the underlying problems and why the violence erupted in the first place,” she said.Two years prior to appointing the Kerner Commission, Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, with the aim of removing barriers that had prevented black Americans from exercising their right to vote. However, blacks in the South were still being declined their right by state and local governments. And despite voting against every single civil rights proposal as a House representative, Johnson received credit during his presidency as a civil rights pioneer because he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.The summary of the Kerner Commission's final report ended with a quote from Dr. Kenneth Clark, a scholar who witnessed the first commission meeting. Clark wrote the findings, like past reports, did not “uncover any startling truths, unique insights, or simple solutions.”“The destruction and the bitterness of racial disorder, the harsh polemics of black revolt and white repression have been seen and heard before in this country,” Clark wrote. “It is time now to end the destruction and the violence, not only in the streets of the ghetto but in the lives of people.”According to Lupo’s book, implementing a commission after a riot was common practice between 1917 and 1968. Thirty-four such commissions were formed after unrest, she wrote.  Missouri Lt. Governor Peter Kinder (R) --who voted against government funding for the Ferguson Commission -- told St. Louis Public radio that he could not find one person “Democrat, Republican or independent -- who believes that a commission sitting and taking testimony and producing a report that is going to gather dust on shelves is going to be a big part of the solution to Ferguson.""Others were more hopeful.Unlike commissions of the past, Ferguson’s is made up of a diverse group of people, including Starsky Wilson, a pastor and the CEO of the Deaconess Foundation, and Rich McClure, the former CEO of UniGroup, a logistics company. The commission also includes law enforcement officials, a former mayor, an attorney and a protest organizer. Brittany Packnett, the St. Louis executive director of Teach for America, is one of the youngest commission members, and also served on President Barack Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing.The task force provides another example of the ""commission"" strategy, as it was formed in the wake of the Ferguson protests and other officer-involved shootings around the country. The group released a report recommending six pillars of improvement, including that officers wear body cameras and get more sleep. But like the Kerner Commission, the task force simply called orders into the air, without having anyone to make sure that various agencies and groups would fulfill the action plan they received. The task force, which interviewed citizens, held all-too-common town hall meetings and relied heavily on the government to implement its recommended policies. It has been months since the final report came out in May, and it seems to have been easily forgotten.Lupo said implementation is probably the hardest stage for commissioners to process. “Policymakers are not accountable to commissions once they report. The commission process does not set up post-report procedures checking in on implementation,” she said.Reflecting on past commissions, Lupo said she couldn't ""point to any of them that saw real policy implementation occur after the release of the report.""Another example of the commission strategy is the McCone Commission, installed following the Watts Riots in the 1960s. It managed to get a few policies, like a transportation grant, implemented, but Lupo said the small changes were “piecemeal tokens” that “didn’t even come close to tackling this deeply embedded problem that the community had with education and racial inequality.”The Ferguson Commission has had several meetings. All have been similar: A public poll of the audience takes place, followed by public comments. The commission then reviews a racial and economic disparity topic, and usually one or two commissioners go over specific research they have started in order to recommend the necessary action plans.In the beginning stages, the meetings were heavily attended, and generally people were overcome with an outpouring of their ideas and personal experiences. But as time went on, the audiences grew smaller, and fewer press badges were in sight. At one meeting, co-chair Starsky Wilson coined the low turnout “Ferguson fatigued.”Because of ongoing protests, national media attention and the Department of Justice's investigation into the region, it didn't take long to expose the systematic racism that had plagued the area for years. St. Louis County's network of municipalities depended on police departments to help raise revenue by distributing petty traffic and ordinance tickets. White flight and resegregation had lead to the downfall of the region's public education system. The area's deep racial disparities make it hard to talk about reform without first considering the widespread inequality. In a draft of its final report, the Ferguson Commission has a list of about 200 calls to action, including recommendations for civilian oversight, community policing, officer wellness, use of force, housing and transportation, job creation training and court reform. There is even a call to action that holds the media accountable for its role in changing the regional narrative on race and ethnicity.Like the Kerner Commission, the Ferguson Commission mostly holds lawmakers, local government and law enforcement accountable for making changes.During a recent commission meeting, co-chair Rich McClure said the group's ""final report won’t sit on a shelf.” And Starsky Wilson told The Huffington Post that there are better parallels for their work than the Kerner Commission.“Not only are we different from the Kerner Commission, but we’re also different than any other commission that convened every 10 years in America,” he said.“There’s some of us who are very intentional and very transparent. We will continue to support actions that move forth policy change. We’ve never kind of unilaterally disarmed from that. Before I was appointed, I was out there on protest lines,” Wilson added.Wilson said that because this group is adequately funded, demographically diverse and has a longer-than-usual timeframe, there will be a positive outcome after the final report is submitted. Wilson also credited the sustained activism and agitation in the community as helping the commission succeed.“It will be different because we're already planning and discussing implementation and leave-behind support, so there can be an entity that has some responsibility for keeping diverse groups of people moving around the calls to action,” he said. On Aug. 24, the Ferguson Commission held its second-to-last meeting. The group reviewed its prior calls to action, and discussed the future of the commission’s work as it prepares to deliver its final report to the governor. Serena Muhammad, the senior project director of strategic partnerships at the St. Louis Mental Health Board, where the slogan is “investing in programs that work,” provided a presentation on how the commission’s recommendations could actually be implemented. She suggested a ""backbone"" strategy of bringing people already advanced in certain policies and strategies into alignment with the commissioners who created the plan.“It’s people playing the role that they’re just positioned to play and not trying to do everything,” Muhammad explained to the audience. One white female audience member interrupted the presentation.“I’m sorry, but isn’t this privatization by another name? At what point do citizens -- who are majority black in Ferguson -- have a vote? You’re talking about a lot of corporate entities, but there’s no vote. Nobody's been elected, and to me this sounds very patronizing. It’s not dealing with police criminality and cross-cultural overreach.”Wilson responded to the woman’s concern.“Privatization -- that’s not where I’m going. Just know that what we’re talking about is a process,” she said. “The process that we're talking about right now is that somehow we assure that someone is accountable to the public for this work.”""We’ve all been saying after September 9 that won’t be the end,"" Rasheen Aldridge, the commission's youngest member, said earlier in same meeting.Wilson told HuffPost that the commission's success will ultimately be up to the local citizens.“It’s not up the commissioners. It’s not up to the governor. It's up to the will of the people. Will we continue to organize, agitate and advocate for real structural change in our region on issues of racial equity, criminal justice and economic equity?"" he said.Lupo, the political science professor and author, said she's not totally pessimistic on the Ferguson Commission.“The very nature of racial uprising or any kind of uprising is that there are some deeply rooted problems that people are upset about. The government only tackles the small issues because it's not worth it for them politically -- unfortunately -- to deal with the big issues. But then again, if the commission has commissioners staying on and pressuring policymakers to make changes, that can be a game-changer,"" she said."
10,SPORTS,Roger Goodell 'Open To Changing' His Disciplinary Role After 'Deflategate',Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roger-goodell-deflategate-discipline_us_55eef2eee4b093be51bc1418,The NFL commissioner's disciplinary authority has come under scrutiny since a federal judge overturned Tom Brady's suspension.,2015-09-08,<p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says he is open to changing his role in the league's disciplinary proceedings.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55eef4301700009a015699cb.jpeg?ops=crop_0_158_5184_2883%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has faced widespread criticism for his handling of the “Deflategate” scandal since a federal judge vacated his decision to suspend New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady last week. Now, Goodell says he is open to a re-evaluation of his role in the league’s disciplinary proceedings, even as the league continues its appeal of U.S. District Judge Richard Berman’s ruling.“Yes, I’m very open to changing my role on [discipline],” Goodell said on ESPN Radio’s “Mike and Mike” Tuesday morning.Listen to Goodell's comments on ESPN Radio’s ""Mike and Mike.""Goodell did not say he was open to changes because of the Deflategate ruling. Instead, he said, his role in disciplinary proceedings “has become extremely time-consuming.”Goodell has attempted to wield a powerful disciplinary hammer during his time as commissioner -- a position that gives him the authority, under the NFL’s collective bargaining agreement, to mete out punishment and sit as the final decision-maker in the appeals processes.But his authority has increasingly been questioned -- by both NFL owners and players -- since Deflategate morphed from a scandal about allegations that the Patriots used deflated footballs into the latest battle over players' rights. That reached a possible tipping point Thursday, when Berman overturned Brady’s suspension in a pointed decision that found Goodell had overstepped his bounds under the bargaining agreement by issuing an arbitrary punishment and failing to provide Brady a fair appeals hearing.It was the third major loss for Goodell on a disciplinary issue in the last year, after federal judges overturned the suspensions he handed to former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson under the league’s new domestic violence and child abuse policies.The NFL Players Association has in the past called for neutral arbitration in disciplinary cases, but Goodell said Tuesday that he is hesitant to embrace that idea.“We believe the standards of the NFL are important to uphold,” he said. “We don’t believe you delegate that responsibility or those standards.”Instead, he said the NFL could be open to changes that include a “discipline officer” or “some type of panel” that could make initial decisions, while a “designee” from the commissioner’s office would hear appeals.The NFLPA has said changes to the disciplinary process, or Goodell's role in it, should be the subject of bargaining.“There are only two options moving forward,” George Atallah, the union's assistant executive director for external affairs, told The Huffington Post last week. “Either the commissioner and league office respect the parameters of our CBA, or we work together to improve the system.”"

Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), left, and Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) have joined 26 other Republican men in threatening a government shutdown over <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/planned-parenthood"">Planned Parenthood</a> funding.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A group of 28 House Republican lawmakers, all men, are pledging to do everything in their power to defund Planned Parenthood this fall, even it means shutting down the federal government in protest. In a letter circulated this summer by Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), the congressmen pledged to vote against any bill that funds the federal government if it includes money for Planned Parenthood. Congress must fund the government by Sept. 30 to avoid a shutdown.""We must act to fully defund Planned Parenthood,"" the letter says. ""Please know that we cannot and will not support any funding resolution – an appropriations bill, an omnibus package, a continuing resolution, or otherwise – that contains any funding for Planned Parenthood, including mandatory funding streams.""The lawmakers cited a series of heavily edited undercover videos that show Planned Parenthood doctors discussing the donation of fetal tissue for medical research after abortions. The anti-abortion group that circulated the videos claims that the family planning provider is selling fetal parts for profit, although multiple state investigations into that claim have come up with nothing. Planned Parenthood receives about $500 million in government funding, mostly through Medicaid and a federal family planning program. The money is used to subsidize birth control, cancer screenings and other women's health services. The longstanding Hyde Amendment prevents any federal funds from being used to pay for abortions, but Republicans have been trying to defund Planned Parenthood over its abortion services since 2011.The current fight over Planned Parenthood funding has divided the GOP. While Republican leaders in the House and Senate are hoping to avoid a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding -- because the GOP would likely absorb most of the blame for it -- the conservative voices in both chambers are growing louder. As Mulvaney's letter continues to gain signatures, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is leading the effort on the Senate side to hold up the must-pass federal budget bill in a bid to defund the family planning provider. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) waved the white flag on the Planned Parenthood fight last week, conceding that Republicans don't have the votes to defund the organization this year. But if enough Republicans sign on to Mulvaney's pledge and stand their ground in the fall, the House could potentially stall the government funding bill on its own. ""If we shut down government, it will be because you have willful Republicans who are prepared to take the government hostage to attain their ends,"" House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters on Tuesday. ""It will not be a stumble; it will be a considered objective, and a number of them have said so publicly."" The 28 Republicans threatening a shutdown are Reps. Mulvaney, Jim Jordan (Ohio), John Fleming (La.), Raúl Labrador (Idaho), Matt Salmon (Ariz.), Tim Huelskamp (Kan.), Jeff Duncan (S.C.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Trey Gowdy (S.C.), Walter Jones (N.C.), Curt Clawson (Fla.), Jim Bridenstine (Okla.), Keith Rothfus (Pa.), Randy Weber (Texas), Scott Perry (Pa.), Steven Pearce (N.M.), Trent Franks (Ariz.), Louie Gohmert (Texas), Ted Yoho (Fla.), Jody Hice (Ga.), David Rouzer (N.C.), Dave Brat (Va.), Mark Meadows (N.C.), Scott DesJarlais (Tenn.), Mark Walker (N.C.), Brian Babin (Texas), David Schweikert (Ariz.), and Trent Kelly (Miss.).
