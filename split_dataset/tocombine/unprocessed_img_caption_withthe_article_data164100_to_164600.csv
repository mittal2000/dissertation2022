Pretty amazing, given all of those ""Hallmark Holiday"" references many have given it over the years. True, some of those pessimists were bad boyfriends and husbands who hated to shop, but February 14th has also been targeted by genius marketing campaigns triggering the guilt and competitiveness of consumers. Still, there are plenty of important lessons to learn from Valentine's Day.We learn these lessons from the time we are in kindergarten. Some come from heartache, some from parental guidance and others from personal insight. There's nothing wrong with a gift-giving holiday to celebrate love, but if we can become better people in the process, that's the real gift.Everyone gets a card. When it came to classroom cards, my mom had one rule: If card-giving happens, the student gives one to everyone in the elementary school class. When I became a parent, it became my rule for Valentine's Day and birthday parties. Being excluded can be a form of bullying. It may have been decades ago, but I can still recall those elementary school peers who received one or two cards in their homemade boxes, while others squealed in delight at their overflowing bounty. Parents should consider the impact of their children's actions upon other children. It's a card, not a prom invitation.Gifts don't have to be expensive to be treasured.Macaroni necklaces, cards made of paper lace doilies and love notes can be special gifts. After her mother's death, author Mary Lou Quinlan learned that lesson first-hand when she found boxes of notes her mother had left behind. Quinlan shares her story in the New York Times Bestseller The God Box: Sharing My Mother's Gift of Faith, Love and Letting Go.You don't need a date, a gift or a partner to be special.Contrary to media messages and pushy relatives and friends, you don't need a romantic relationship to be your best self. A bad relationship is worse than no relationship. Value yourself. Build a strong support network. Ask for help when you need it. And don't be so intent on romantic relationship seeking that you lose sight of the wonderful people and valuable parts of your life that bring you joy.Last-minute is sometimes too late.Valentine's Day restaurant reservations book up. Flower bins dry up. And greeting card options dwindle. Unless you prefer to be faced with nasty-colored mums and a card that says ""To The Love of My Life"" for someone you've known for 18 days (OK, so you're sure he or she is ""the one,"" but just bear with me here), start a few days ahead, gentleman. And before accusing me of being sexist, head out to a card store or florist at 6 p.m. on February 14th. Do a head count by gender and get back to me.Love and respect people every day and you won't have to scramble to compensate on February 14th. Happy Valentine's Day!"

This starchy, lower-sugar banana sibling is a main staple at many tables from Florida to Cuba to Puerto Rico. We love plantain recipes because they vary so widely from sweet to savory. It's rare to find an ingredient with the range and versatility of plantains. When green, they are starchy and very low in sugar, like the potatoes of bananas. They are amazing mashed, fried or baked in savory dishes (they are also amazing in soups). Then, as they ripen off the vine and their skins turn black as night, their sugar level increases and they become perfect candidates for dessert preparations. Whether you've eaten plantains for your entire life or are just getting started, we've got 10 recipes for plantains that we absolutely love.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

Though to outsiders Raffles is more synonymous with cocktails and luxurious hotel accommodations, Raffles was a real person, and the founder of modern Singapore. Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles founded Singapore on February 6, 1819. He had arrived on behalf of the British East India Company to develop the southern part of the island as a British trading post, which he did after signing a treaty with the sultan. It wasn't until 1824 that the entire island went to the British, and it wasn't until 1963 that Singapore would gain its independence. Due to its position in Asia, Singapore is a true melting pot of cultures from Malaysia, China, India and this is reflected in the architecture, culture and cuisine of the nation, all of which are also still flecked with remnants of the Brits. There are plenty of things to do in Singapore, like visiting the famous botanic gardens, exploring the Singapore Art Museum and shopping on Orchard Road. However, the number one activity for visitors to Singapore is certainly eating, as the country is famous for its hawker centers. Here, street food is almost an art form, and a trip is not complete without a taste of local classics like hokkien mee, chicken rice, carrot cake or chili crab.There's lots to love about Singapore, take a peek below.

4,WELLNESS,The Super Bowl and Survivor Guilt,"Dr. Gregory Jantz , Contributor
Mental Health Expert and Founder of The Center â€¢ A Place of HOPE",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sandy-hook-super-bowl_us_5b9cc989e4b03a1dcc81da99,"I recognize those children were placed at the Super Bowl for good and sincere reasons. I have to wonder, though, if that's really what's best for at least some of those children.",2013-02-06,"NEW ORLEANS, LA - FEBRUARY 03: Singer Jennifer Hudson performs 'America The Beautiful' with the Sandy Hook Elementary School Chorus prior to the start of Super Bowl XLVII between the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome on February 3, 2013 in New Orleans, Louisiana. (Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc9892100003100c5438e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like millions of Americans on Sunday, I watched the Super Bowl. My goals were to watch a great game of football, clever commercials and an entertaining halftime show. The game turned out to be much more compelling in the second half (after the 30-minute power outage delay) than the first half. I liked many of the commercials, but some of them fell decidedly flat. The halftime show produced the expected spectacle of star power. What continues to hold my attention, though, came before the game ever started -- the Sandy Hook Elementary School choir singing ""America the Beautiful"" with Jennifer Hudson during the pre-game show. I had a visceral, emotional reaction that I doubt was the one show producers were going for.As I watched the children, smiling and clearly excited to be on stage in front of a stadium packed with people and broadcast to millions, I felt a sense of unease, flashing back to images of Dec. 14. It wasn't so long ago those children were awash in violent chaos, crying, screaming, grieving, wondering why. The Sandy Hook massacre took place less than two months ago. How disorienting must it be to go from sheer terror and grief into a massive national spotlight? I recognize those children were placed at the Super Bowl for good and sincere reasons. A statement from the students was reported as saying, ""We have come to New Orleans to represent the Sandy Hook Family and the community of Newtown, Conn. Our wish is to demonstrate to America and the world that 'We are Sandy Hook, and We Choose Love.'"" Such a large task for small shoulders. There were 26 children in the Sandy Hook choir, perhaps representing the 26 killed at the school.I understand the symbolism and heartfelt desire to turn something terrible into something uplifting. Yet, I still can't get past my unease. If I had to give my unease a name, it would be survivor guilt. I'm concerned about these children, and others at Sandy Hook, becoming caught up in currents meant to sweep them past the horror yet swirling them toward an unintended threat. Survivor guilt is just that -- guilt that you have survived a terrible ordeal when others, especially others you love, have not. Survivors can experience tremendous feelings of fault for somehow living when others have died. Survivors will compare themselves to those who died and determine an injustice was done, especially when those who died are placed on an elevated status after death. When comparing yourself to someone set high upon a pedestal, it's difficult to look anywhere but up, emphasizing how low you are. The conclusion becomes: If someone had to die, it really should have been you.It was 51 days from the massacre to the Super Bowl. So soon and so much attention; those children may feel as if they are caught up in a whirlwind. Life placed them in a certain position, and now notoriety has placed them in another. Putting those children at the Super Bowl feels to me like an adult response, a desire to turn a tragedy around, to move from grief to action. I have to wonder, though, if that's really what's best for at least some of those children. For the past 51 days, I've done media interviews on what trauma looks like in school children. People want to know how children react when a safe place, like a school, suddenly becomes a battleground. I've outlined symptoms of stress and anxiety, from regression like bed-wetting, to nightmares, worry and stomachaches. People are concerned about children reacting thousands of miles from Sandy Hook. Watching the pre-game show Sunday, I couldn't help but wonder at the reaction of those 26 children who were literally at ground zero. As a therapist, my advice would be to watch them carefully, especially after the lights go down and the show is over.For more by Dr. Gregory Jantz, Ph.D., click here.For more on mental health, click here."

(AP Photo/Matthew Mead)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cca362400005100535665.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"by Marla Gulley Roncaglia, Italian Cuisine Expert for the Menuism Italian Food Blog Photos by Marla GulleyWhen dining in or out, Italians generally think about the quality and how flavorsome their food is, followed by the order and timing to ensure digestion and maximize enjoyment. Meals are a multi-course affair that tends to expand and contract as needed. You can be assured that there will be at least three courses, maybe two, but never just one plate. Pizza, however, is the exception because you will be enjoying an entire pizza of your own, so an additional salad or small starter would be about all most people could fit in. Naturally, there are many variations on the Italian dining experience, but the traditional menu throughout all of Italy consists of antipasti, primi piatti , secondi piatti with or without contorno, dolce, and beverages. Antipasti: These are the myriad small starter dishes, served before the pasta. The selections are usually divided between cold and hot, and oftentimes whether they are from the earth or sea. Primi Piatti: First plates are usually starches like gnocchi, risotto, or pasta, although other selections might be a rustic tart, vegetable flan, or very occasionally, soup. Soup is usually a home selection not often found on Italian menus. You might occasionally find a special soup on a menu or maybe a pasta and bean dish called pasta fagioli.Secondi Piatti: Second plates are usually the main or meat course, which ranges from fish to pork, rabbit, or beef. Lamb and goat are found on menus around holidays. Chicken is not often found on most menus as it is considered to be home fare. You will, however, find turkey and quail in its place. Contorno: Vegetable side dishes not usually included unless it is a home-cooked meal or a fixed price meal. Dolce: Sweets or dessert, with endless possibilities. Some of the most recognizable would be tiramisu, pannacotta, cannoli, rum baba and the legendary Italian gelato and sorbet. Beverages: Water: Sparkling or still is the normal offering at an additional cost unless included in a set menu, even though water from the tap is quite drinkable. It's just the tradition.  Wine: Optional house variety by the glass or carafe or a bottle of your choice. Fixed price meals, or tourist menus as they are sometimes called, include a 1/4-liter carafe, red or white.  Coffee: An espresso, as that is Italy's coffee. Digestive: This category includes a small shot of strong alcohol, normally sipped to bring the meal to a close and aid in digestion. When dining at home, most Italians would include a small antipasto, just a nibble to get the digestive juices flowing. It might be a simple slice of salami, Parma ham, marinated vegetables, anchovies or olives, just to name a few. After antipasti or starters, home diners might have a primi piatti or secondi and on some occasions both for an everyday meal. They might opt for fresh fruit for a simple daily dessert. Table wine is young, less complex with lower alcohol content, and usually served with most meals. Some families still make their own wine but it's possible and very economical to buy table wine. Many people buy a large 50-liter damigiana (large glass bottle) and fill it up at the local wine consortium. Most meals are finished off with a coffee, maybe followed by a strong spirit known as a digestive. Some Italians, like my in-laws, like to combine the two after lunch and dinner with what is called caffe corretto, which translates to ""corrected coffee,"" consisting of a nip of grappa added to espresso. A restaurant's fixed price menu is a streamlined three-course menu of simply prepared dishes that is popular everywhere in Italy, especially at lunchtime. The modest price includes one dish from several choices of primi piatti, secondi piatti, and dessert. A small bottle of water, 1/4 liter of table wine, and coffee are included as well. It's a good value and makes it easier to get back to the workplace on time. Sunday lunch is a time-honored tradition. Most families still like to gather at Mamma's for her home cooking whenever possible. If not, then family or friends will meet up at a favorite restaurant to share a leisurely meal together. Lunch commences at noon and stretches out over the courses till at least 4 pm. The menu expands with two or three antipasti, possibly two meats with two vegetables and two desserts, one being gelato and the other a cake of some sort. The beverages are water, wine, coffee and digestive liqueur. At holiday meals like Christmas, New Year's, Easter, and all special occasions including weddings, one must really learn to pace yourself in order to make it through the entire meal. Each category expands, and others are added. All the regions and families have their own special additions and traditions to add to the feast and it makes for a festive, if not somewhat overwhelming, experience.According to my in-laws, a good wedding dinner needs to have at least five antipasti. Cold, hot, fishy, and meaty would all be represented. There should be two primi piatti, always a pasta dish, usually filled pasta, and another starchy dish like gnocchi. The wine is naturally flowing, and if the meal started with an aperitif or sparkling wine, it has moved on from white to hearty bottles of red by now. The stream of dishes continues with two meat dishes, one maybe a fish, or fowl with a vegetable, then another red meat dish with accompanying vegetable. Breath deep and maybe stretch a bit as there is still more to come. Some weddings I have attended encouraged dancing between courses, which not only helped tamp the food down, but was also downright fun.You might think now was time for dessert, but here in the Alps, famous for its cheeses, this would be the time for the cheese course. Usually there are several local cheeses like Tomini and Toma, but Gorgonzola is usually on offer too. After the cheese sampler, the fruit course is often referred to as the Macedonia, or a mixed fresh fruit cup to refresh the palate.  Next up is the gelato and then the cake or other luscious creamy dessert. In addition, just when you thought you had made it through all of the courses, the pastacini, or miniature pastries that this area so loves are brought out. Other areas have many different sweets that will be on offer too. For this course and maybe the cake as well, sparkling dessert wines like moscato or passito will be brought to finish the meal. Espresso is served as the final course, followed by the digestive spirits, which by now everyone is in need of. Grappa is the most well known Italian spirit offered after dinner. Every region or pocket of Italy has its own traditional, and sometimes homemade spirit, liqueur, or infusion that is enjoyed at the close of a meal. This truly is the end of the meal, and it's time to consider taking a passeggiata, which is the traditional after-dinner walk to savor all the flavors and conversations of the day.

I will admit, I'm not the biggest nut person. I rarely crave them. In fact, I don't seek them out. Nuts, in general, don't make it into my pantry as a snack. So, when I came across The Well Dressed Nut, it's not that I was skeptical, I guess you could say, I was just going through the motions of story research. I wasn't thinking too much about it, UNTIL I took that first bite: CRUNCH, CRUNCH, CRUNCH. Immediately, my brain and tastebuds kicked in: what's that flavor, and THAT spice? What IS that? That hot, peppery kick in the back end of the bite, that's new. That's interesting. All these flavors, woke me up. It was a nice change. And, they have a nice story.Lynn and Joan don't come from the food world. They originally met, and became close friends, selling beauty products in New York City for twenty years. After they left their careers, they still wanted to work together. They searched and brainstormed ideas for awhile, hoping to find something fun and challenging, until one day, after one too many dinner parties, an idea fell NUT-urally into their lap. haha.So, enjoy the story of The Well Dressed Nut! Hope you purchase a few pouches online to try them. They carry a variety of flavors in their ""Flavor Wardrobe"".

But I'm mostly thinking about how lucky I feel to be surrounded by so much talent. Truthfully, the hardest part about fashion is not the vision or one great idea, but the execution of each aspect. That's where I am so lucky. Not only do I have my own amazing in-house team working to bring it all to life, but twice a year I get to assemble a group of experts to bring my vision to life.I love that saying, ""If you're the most talented person in the room, you're probably in the wrong room."" I think there are those individuals who are intimidated by really smart, talented people. But for me surrounding yourself with great talent is the key to success.So each season, we come back together with some of the people we have built relationships with and bring in a few new ones that help us take things to that next level. They become my adopted ""fashion"" family for a few weeks and during that time I see them more than I do my own family.One of my favorite people to work with each season is our model casting director Julia Samersova of Cast Inc. NYC. You may know her from her TV show Scouted on the E! network. Casting is actually a much more difficult process than you might expect and we see hundreds of girls just to find the 16 we need for the presentation. I can tell Julia what I'm looking for and she get's it. But she also has very strong opinions and challenges me if she thinks I'm overlooking a girl. I still second-guess her all the time, but ultimately I rely on her vision. She is also such a mom. When she heard I was feeling a bit unwell, she brought all kinds of tea, lemons, honey, Echinacea and Thieves Oil (which I had never heard about before -- but highly recommend) to our casting session. She's a really nurturing person and I love that.This will be our third season working with LancÃ´me. As a little girl, I used to look at their ads and just dream about being able to be a part of that world, so it's such an honor to be able to work with them. Their team is amazing and they get so excited about my collection. This season they have given us three of their top makeup artists to lead the beauty team, Darais, Tarek Abbas and Alex Sanchez. They will have their hands full, because although I usually gravitate towards a very effortless look that I call ""enhanced natural,"" this season I decided I wanted to go edgier. I won't lie, I am a bit nervous. But I'm stepping out of my comfort zone, and even if it's the wrong decision I want to push myself to take the risk.The hair will also be a bit edgier than what we've done before. I enlisted the help of Patrick Melville to create the look. Patrick and I met at a photo shoot last year and we instantly hit it off. Truthfully, I'm normally very picky about who does my hair. In fact, I usually prefer to do it myself. I like it to look natural, but maybe a bit more enhanced and glamorous. Are you sensing a theme yet?Well, Patrick was one of the first hairstylists I met that gave me exactly what I wanted. Which makes sense since he does the same for Halle Berry, Heidi Klum and a host of other amazing ladies. I started out wanting something quite simple for the hair, but it quickly began to evolve into something a bit more involved. Then one evening I was in that sort of half-asleep state and I had this really clear vision of something a little more out there. I mentioned it to Patrick the next day and he was able to create the look just as I had imagined it.The second newcomer to my Fashion Week family is Zanna Roberts Rassi. Zanna is the senior fashion editor at Marie Claire and one of those women street style photographers continually gravitate to and chronicle her looks. She's been on my radar for some time. I relate to her chic sensibility, unexpected pairings and the slight tomboy vibe. You hear all these horror stories about working with a big stylist and how they were a complete diva and I'd like to tell you Zanna was a total diva (only because you're probably sick of hearing me say how nice everyone is!). But she is the exact opposite. She's incredibly focused and hard working. She was down on her hands and knees doing everything herself, but she also made the whole process completely collaborative. What's coolest about Zanna is how down to earth and humble she is -- but maybe that's the measure of true talent. Another really talented collaborator I enjoyed working with is Meredith Kahn. Meredith is the designer behind the jewelry lines Made Her Think and Meredith Kahn Fine Jewelry. We were introduced last season by a mutual friend and just really hit it off. Even though I design my own jewelry, one of the great things about my job is being able to bring in really talented collaborators. Meredith's own collections have such a great rock-n-roll spirit, so I wanted to see what we could come up with together. I knew she would bring a cool and edgy energy to the project. We showed a few of the pieces from the collaboration at our spring presentation, and this season we are showing an ornamental collar that we had developed together. We didn't get a chance to show it last season and I think it works really well with all the other jewelry we developed for this collection. It brings in a touch of drama. I could go on and on, but I have realized something as I've been writing this post. The key to creating a great presentation and executing my vision fully is really in finding people who are not only incredibly talented, but also fun to be around. I read somewhere recently that you shouldn't work with anyone that wouldn't be good company at dinner. I think it's good advice and certainly true in my case. Now I just have to find time to schedule dinner!"
