(For the record, Gwyneth interviewed us for her blog, goop.com, two years ago and cited our book, Conscious Loving, as one of her favorite relationship books.)Here's a brief look at what Conscious Uncoupling is:  Contrast Conscious Uncoupling with the more traditional kind, unconscious uncoupling. In the unconscious variety, both parties engage in blame and bitter recrimination throughout much of the process. In unconscious uncoupling, one or both people are unable to discuss important items such as children or money without blame-rages and other behavior that slows down the process. The worst effects of Unconscious Uncoupling are on children, who are forced to watch as parents use the splitting-up process as a further escalation of the patterns that caused problems in the first place.In Conscious Uncoupling, both people commit to communicating their feelings transparently to each other, especially the ones relationship counselors call The Big Three: anger, fear and sadness. In Conscious Uncoupling both people commit to taking responsibility for the state of the relationship rather than engaging in blame toward the other. In Conscious Uncoupling you live in the question, ""What can I learn from this?"" not ""Why is he/she/the world doing this to me?"" Eventually you evolve to an even more powerfully positive question: ""What can I learn from all this that will help me be more loving and loved in my next relationship?""--Kathlyn Hendricks, Ph.D. and Gay Hendricks, Ph.D. have been married and working together since 1980. Their book, Conscious Loving, is a classic in the field of relationship transformation."
1,DIVORCE,A Conscious Look at Conscious Uncoupling:  4 Steps to a Successful Separation,"David Kessler, Contributor

I define conscious uncoupling as recognizing that not all marriages are meant to last forever and both parties deserve to leave whole and intact. While some may dismiss this new terminology as woo woo, divorce is a reality and worth discussing. Nobody goes into a marriage hoping for it to terminate -- it is a loss of tremendous magnitude. As someone who specializes in grief and healing, one of the ideas I've heard over and over again at the end of life is that people wish they dissolved a relationship grateful for the lessons instead of bitter about the hurt. And, I have learned that a marriage can be successful even if it ends in divorce. I talk about this approach when I lecture and I wrote about it in my new book, You Can Heal Your Heart with Louise Hay. I ask the question: Wouldn't it be great if we could say, ""What a wild ride that was,"" ""Glad we did it,"" or ""I really enjoyed being with you?""It's easy to say... and extremely hard to do. Even small steps in that direction are progress.If you are in the process of separating (or know someone who is), here are four steps to support you in finding the new beginning you and your family deserve. 1. Be ""for"" the other person. In the old model of divorce, there is a winner and a loser. In the new paradigm, you both win! You help each other be your best. This may sound crazy, but it will benefit both of you. 2. Focus on what you've gained, not what you've lost. Celebrate the gifts you've given each other. Be grateful for the experiences you shared with all their highs and lows. When you adapt to that frame of mind, you will see valuable lessons that allow you to grow beyond the marriage.3. Choose your kids over being right. Put your kids first. Don't fight in front of your kids or speak negatively about your ex to your kids. As Gwyneth beautifully said, you are and always will be a family. Protect that family with everything you have. 4. Never say I won't love again. Maybe you are not ready now, but know that you deserve to find love again. When you say, ""I won't love again"" you're telling your subconscious you are not worthy of love. You are worthy of love, but it's only going to happen if you believe it will! Tell yourself that you will love again and mean it. And when you do find love, keep in mind strategies 1 and 3 so that your growing family continues to be whole. Remember this: People who divorce well, live well! Choose to honor your history, interact lovingly and fearlessly create anew."

3,WEDDINGS,5 Wedding Trends That Have to Go: A Wedding Planner's Rant,"Sandy Malone, Contributor

That means I help brides and grooms choose venues, vendors and arrange logistics. The bride (and sometimes groom) choose the colors, the theme and the general spirit of the décor. My only job here is to execute their plan, even if the color scheme makes me want to throw up in my own mouth. Or laugh my ass off.After almost eight years in the Caribbean destination wedding planning business, and nearly 500 weddings under my belt, I have seen some really truly hideous color schemes, and some painfully stupid ideas. I've seen beautiful inspiration too, but that's not the funny stuff to talk about today.Even before Pinterest took over the world, girls were coming up with really bizarre ideas that made me wonder if they were pregnant as well as engaged (pregnancy was how my friend Liz's mom explained their turquoise front door). And now that bridal professionals are labeling things ""color of the year,"" it's pretty funny to see what some brides believe will look good with the Pantone Radiant Orchid. No, actually, it doesn't go with ""everything."" Teal and orchid? Barf.Rather than really hating some of the décor I have to create, I try to find the humor in it. Really I do. We do a lot of laughing around this office. When a bride wanted a decorated Porta Potty, I sent her 20 pictures with different options. I almost peed myself laughing in the process of finding the pics online (no really, go Google images for them), but I did it. She wisely opted against the Porta Potty later on. I think my suggestions scared the hell out of her.But to be fair, I tell the clients my honest opinion about everything they ask for, and I laugh with them as I'm ordering the neon fabric, or burlap, or emerald green and turquoise cupcakes. My opinion doesn't matter in the least -- but I'm allowed to have a sense of humor. If I didn't, I'd lose it. How do you keep a straight face when you're listening to someone describe their dream peacock wedding in the Caribbean? It's a good thing I rarely Skype.With all that said, there are some things that just have to stop. I know that you won't all agree with me, but if you did what I do every day and you saw the pictures some of my brides send me, you'd probably agree more than you realize. And anyway, it doesn't really matter what I think because my clients will continue to want what they want, and my company will always deliver. But, if I had my druthers, the following five things would go away. Forever.#1 -- It's time to stop it with the burlap. For real, that shit is nasty. It molts everywhere, doesn't cut well without running, and frankly, it smells bad. And it looks like... burlap. If you must have table runners, for God's sake use something that was intended for use outside of a barn or packing plant. There are plenty of affordable options online. Cheap burlap actually catches on delicate fabrics on your guests' and wedding party's dresses.#2 -- No more tying lace around everything that stands still -- including the cake. It does not make your wedding ""vintage."" It reminds me of my deceased mother-in-law who spray-painted everything gold. Tying lace around mason jars makes your wedding shabby-chic, and if that's the look you're going for, let's do it. But if you want ""vintage,"" let's get a little more creative and spend a little bit more money than just sending me yards of random lace remnants you picked up without thought or reason. It's cute, I'll admit -- but the look is not elegant.#3 -- Seriously consider WHERE you're getting married to avoid being tackier than necessary in your décor. I'm sure that a peacock theme, for example, could be lovely up north, using jewel tones for a fall or winter wedding. But on the 4th of July on Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, making your bridesmaids wear emerald green and turquoise satin dresses is just mean. It looks stupid. And kinda ugly, to be honest. And carrying through your theme into a tower of 150 turquoise and emerald green cupcakes makes your wedding reception look like a birthday party... for an eight-year-old. Just sayin'.#4 -- There is a fine line between planning something ""different"" and planning something weird. Don't feel like you have to be the first bride ever to try something. It's okay to follow some traditions. I'm still on the fence about the teepee my April clients are sending down (cool or weird?), but I'm going to make sure that they get all the pictures they want of it and will reserve judgment until after the wedding weekend. #5 -- Let's avoid the creepy, weird, edible, bobble-head-looking dolls of yourselves as cake toppers. Giant paper cut-outs of yourselves to have everybody sign as a guest book are weird and scary. And I'm not even going there today with the whole dressing up a chair to resemble a dead loved one thing. I've blogged about appropriate ways to honor your passed relatives before. Read that and take heed.Look, maybe you're thinking I'm judgmental, but it's not just me. I hear what your wedding guests think because they babble to the wedding planning team like we're a confessional booth. And when they think burlap tied on the tiki torches is tacky, they let us know on no uncertain terms... almost challenging us. My response is always a very diplomatic ""it's what the bride and groom wanted."" And my tone never indicates that I think your choices are anything less than fabulous. But my point is that I'm telling you guys to stop doing the things your wedding guests are making jokes about.Sometimes brides and grooms get so wrapped up in the magic of wedding planning that they lose perspective on reality. It's one thing to have all the bells and whistles, but you don't have to tie a bow on every whistle, and you don't need to dip the bells in glitter, if you know what I mean. It can be difficult for some clients to stop planning even when everything is finished and decided. And that's when the weird stuff starts arriving in big boxes because somebody's been shopping online at 3 a.m. again.I tell all my clients that my opinion is only that -- an opinion -- and they should do whatever makes them happy. Which is why I have to sign off now and start cutting burlap and tying giant lace bows for an upcoming wedding. I'm just the wedding planner.Until next time, happy wedding planning from Weddings in Vieques and Weddings in Culebra!Sandy"

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df1d6240000500053c8e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During a recent interview with beauty blog and apparent disseminator of wacky health tips, Into The Gloss, actress Shailene Woodley described clay as ""one of the best things you can put into your body."" Her evidence? A friend had metallic-smelling bowel movements after eating clay -- a sure sign, Woodley claims, of heavy metals leaving the body. (More on that later, but PSA: The body is able to ""detoxify"" all on its own -- your liver and kidneys do that for you. Pretty cool, right?) Also, one time a cab driver told the actress that pregnant women in his community (we do not know where, he is referred to only as ""African"") ate clay -- a practice known to researchers as geophagy. Perhaps her driver was referring to the uncommon pica cravings some pregnant women experience. Or the practice in some indigenous communities, where food sources are scarce, of eating soil as a nutrient supplement. ""This is a practice in some indigenous cultures, and I think that probably came about because they did not have access to certain nutrients in their diet, like calcium from dairy, or iron, and there are some minerals in dirt or clay,"" explained TODAY Show contributor and gastroenterologist Dr. Roshini Raj. Indeed, women in communities that don't include calcium-rich dairy in their diets are more likely to eat clay, research suggests. But there are better ways to get calcium, iron and minerals, doctors agree. And while eating clay is mostly harmless, there are some concerns about both a pregnant woman and her fetus, actually being exposed to arsenic, lead and other toxicants that naturally occur in soil. The same goes for non-pregnant people.That's the opposite of the intended effect of so-called ""healing clays,"" which are taking off as a bit of a wellness trend, to remove toxins, heavy metals, impurities, and chemicals that are thought to have been ingested. While there is some evidence that clays can help remove toxicants from food sources when used in a culinary context, there is no substantial medical evidence that these clays, including popular bentonite clay, remove toxins. And, anyway, most people don't need help in this regard: Our livers and kidneys, if healthy, are perfectly capable of clearing our systems of trace amounts of ""impurities"" from our environments. The actress went on to explain further: So, I've discovered that clay is great for you because your body doesn’t absorb it, and it apparently provides a negative charge, so it bonds to negative isotopes. And, this is crazy: it also helps clean heavy metals out of your body. My friend starting eating it and the next day she called me and said, ‘Dude, my shit smells like metal.’ She was really worried, but we did some research together and everything said that when you first start eating clay, your bowel movements, pee, and even you, yourself, will smell like metal.""Removing metal from the body is not necessarily good -- iron, for example, is a metal and essential to health. So, there could conceivably be benefits, but there could certainly be harms -- and a favorable benefit/harm ratio has not been established to justify recommending this,"" says Dr. David L. Katz, M.D., MPH, FACPM, FACP, a HuffPost blogger and founding director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University. Katz additionally called her assertion about the negative charge of clay ""meaningless."" We don't mean to harp on the actress, whose layperson experiments are her own business. But given the reach of celebrity health claims, combined with their lack of expertise and occasionally harmful -- even deadly -- consequences, it's important to address what's informed and based in fact and what's merely the opinion of a non-medical professional.

6,PARENTING,Kourtney Kardashian Opens Up About Attachment Parenting,Cavan Sieczkowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kourtney-kardashian-attachment-parenting_us_5b9df207e4b03a1dcc8f482d,Attachment parenting is a technique popularized by Dr. William Sears in 1992's The Baby Book that includes practices like,2014-03-26,"NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - MARCH 24: Kourtney Kardashian attends the Kardashian Kids For Babies 'R' US Launch at Soho House on March 24, 2014 in New York City.

""[B]oth Mason and Penelope still sleep in my bed,"" Kardashian told Redbook magazine about her son, 4, and daughter, 19 months. ""It’s what came naturally to me; I didn’t plan it. When I had Mason, I just felt really attached to him, and wanted to bring him everywhere. He ended up sleeping with me, and I breastfed for 14 months.""She said the two little ones go to sleep in their own beds, but ""end up in my bed, sometimes within minutes."" This does not always bode well for private time with Disick. ""It’s a challenge, and something we talk about constantly,"" she said. ""Mostly there are times each night when the kids are in their own rooms, and sometimes it even lasts all night. Every night is different."" Attachment parenting is a technique popularized by Dr. William Sears in 1992's The Baby Book that includes practices like breastfeeding, baby-wearing and co-sleeping. The ideology made headlines back in 2012 when mother Jamie Lynn Grumet appeared on the cover of Time magazine, breastfeeding her 3-year-old son. Other celebrities, like Mayim Bialik, have spoken out about adopting the practice. The ""Big Bang Theory"" star, who also has a Ph.D. in neuroscience, has been using this method to raise her two sons. ""Breastfeeding is the natural, optimal way to feed a child,"" she writes in her book, Beyond the Sling. ""Sleeping with your child, wearing your child in a sling as opposed to pushing them around in expensive strollers, those are things that matter biologically and sociologically for the structure of a family.""Others debate the benefits of attachment parenting. The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated co-sleeping could increase the chance of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Child psychologists have said it could affect a toddler or young child's independence. Some parents think sharing a bed has a negative effect on romance and comfort. But attachment parenting came organically for Kardashian, despite what her other family members may think. “It’s just what came natural to me,"" she told People magazine. ""They definitely all think I’m insane in my family for having them in the bed and breastfeeding them for forever. But I couldn’t care less.”"
