As it is, brides have a million things to think about when planning their ""perfect day"" so of course their dress has to be just as perfect. A few tips for you overwhelmed brides: Before you start the planning, you'll want to first choose your venue. Once you've paid that deposit on the venue, that's when you'll want to run to the bridal stores. (Note that the location and dress you choose set the tone of your wedding -- you won't want to confuse your guests.) You'll definitely want your dress to match the venue and theme of your affair. No one will understand a bride wearing a lei when there isn't a hula dancer in sight and you're nowhere near Hawaii, get my drift? Luckily the sales women at the dress stores are trained professionals so they will always ask the question, ""what did you have in mind?"" Some girls will have no clue and others will be extremely specific -- either response is ok! However, you will definitely want to ""have a vision."" Remember, the idea is that you'll only be wedding dress shopping once in your life so feel free to play dress up and get a feel for exactly what you want. Let's face it, sometimes those sales women can be pushy -- don't let them force you into buying a gown because they think it looks good on you. You need to make sure you feel comfortable and look exactly how you want to in that dress. Do you want to look like Cinderella or be the sultry feminine bride? Sometimes you'll still have no clue -- even when you've tried on the ball gowns, the A-lines, the fit and flare AND the mermaid dresses. (Yes we know, there's endless options... but that can be fun too!) Here's one way that will help you figure it out (it's rather simple really): Pay attention to the images in your mind when you try each dress on: the dress should mentally speak to you. I was lucky enough to know exactly what I was looking for when it came time to dress shop. I probably tried on a total of eight dresses. (I should note that I was having a hotel ballroom wedding so I was looking for a grand, elegant affair-type dress.) I'm still an indecisive Libra though, and I narrowed it down to two Lazaro dresses. I tried both dresses twice and listened to my inner voice. The winning Lazaro took the reign because as I was standing there, in the bridal store with my mom, friend and all the sales ladies looking at me with their ""oohs"" and ""aahs."" I imagined that I was in a forest with a horse standing next to me, ready to take me away to rescue my future husband. (That's right, I'm a modern woman -- we do the rescuing and take them away from their boring pre-marital lives! But let's stay on point...)  When I stopped to actually listen to what the dress was telling me, it screamed ""Mediterranean Romance"" which ultimately cultivated into the theme of our January wedding. At that point, all the visions I needed to see were coming to mind: walking down the aisle, seeing my future husband's face smiling back at me, feeling the love in the ballroom from all the guests that attended. Somehow the dress said all of that to me. So, to sum it up -- first choose your venue and then say yes to your dress. Or better yet -- let the dress say yes to you.www.facebook.com/SomethingTreasured www.etsy.com/Shop/SomethingTreasured8"

(His mother and sister, aged 6, are still in the hospital.) Now the Boston Marathon, which is always held on Patriots' Day, will sadly be remembered differently.My minister friend, Reverend Kim Harvey, was downtown at her Arlington Street Church, within three blocks of the bombings, when the explosions occurred. Reverend Kim helped minister to people's immediate needs, providing refuge from the chaos. She came to my house on her way home late last night, and we communed and meditated together. Today Kim is back at work, ministering to those in need and preparing for a candlelight vigil, just another humble hero in our midst.Obviously, we live in violent, anxious, fragmented times.

Fourteen percent tested positive for Listeria.Places with the most germs tended to be those that aren't cleaned as often as others, including refrigerator compartments and kitchen tools like can openers and blender gaskets.

It is very rewarding to become a part of the family as the detailed planning progresses over the swiftly passing months. Hospitality and celebrating over a festive meal and toasts are the glue that binds, hopefully for a lifetime, and leaves me with the feeling that ""I married them."" But nothing prepared me for the overwhelming responsibility of being an actual wedding officiant.It first came up about a year ago when a close friend and his fiancé asked if I would perform their wedding ceremony. They didn't want a religious ceremony and an anonymous officiant was not appealing either. I said yes. What are the next steps? To the Internet, where I applied to the Universal Life Church, and within a few weeks my certificate of ordination arrived. That is only step one. Next stop, 141 Worth Street, to register with the clerk at the New York City department of marriage licenses. Paperwork, $15, and presentation of my ordination certificate, and I was enrolled in the giant book of ministers/officiants. In an office filled with excited couples accompanied by their friends and families, no one was more thrilled than I was. My friends ended up not getting married this fall. A month before the big day, things changed and the wedding was called off. Back to catering weddings and waiting for another opportunity.I got another chance this spring, when my colleague Matt and his fiancée Lea asked if I would officiate along with our mutual friend Marcy Blum. We were both pivotal in encouraging their relationship (me on his side, Marcy on hers). The certificate was gathering dust and I jumped at the chance to exercise my marriage officiant skills. I asked Matt and Lea to meet with me to talk about the ceremony we would create together. I wanted them to take the time to express their personal feelings about what this giant step -- marriage -- meant to them. I confess, it was a serious moment for all of us, as it well should be. I am married since 1986, so I know the joys and the challenges of what it takes to make a relationship work. I wanted to know that they ""had the stuff,"" as my Grandma Nelly used to say. Lea and Matt had their homework -- to write the story of how they fell in love and then to craft their individual vows. This would comprise the ceremony along with a welcome greeting from me. More thinking -- what does one say when officiating a marriage ceremony? I would not evoke a religious theme, or talk about the sanctity of marriage. I woke at 3:00 a.m. a few nights before the wedding feeling inspired -- I would speak from experience, sharing with the intimate group of gathered guests the many reasons ""we"" marry. The big day arrived. Not surprisingly, I felt very responsible and focused. We gathered in a tight circle. I read my thoughts and Marcy shared hers, peppered with her signature humor in contrast to my seriousness. And as it should be -- the spotlight was on the bride and groom. Below are their vows, heartfelt and individual. The grand finale consisted of us, the officiants, saying the time-honored phrase ""By the powers vested in us by the City of New York, we pronounce you Wife and Husband!"" Who's next?Matt to his bride:  Lea, I could go on forever, I really loved sitting down to write this; to look back on who we were, who we are, how we got here and why we are here tonight...Lea to her groom:Matthew, I want to promise here today, that I will be your true partner in life, in every sense of the word.

4,WELLNESS,Mindfulness-Based Therapies May Help Ease Stress Of Cancer Treatment,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mindfulness-cancer-treatment-therapies-stress_us_5b9d0e5de4b03a1dcc841804,"Emotional distress, in turn, can have a significant impact on the course of the illness. Depression has been shown to hasten",2013-04-17,Young teenager with her eyes gently closed in contemplation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0e5d2400005100536f59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The word ""cancer"" alone can trigger a stress response, and for those undergoing cancer treatment, the experience can easily be the most stressful they ever endure. After all, research has shown that roughly half of people with advanced or terminal cancer struggle with mental health conditions including depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders. Recently, mindfulness -- an increasingly popular (and scientifically backed) antidote to stress and depression that involves cultivating a focused awareness on the present moment -- has been gaining traction as a treatment for the mental health woes that commonly affect cancer patients. According to Australian Cancer Council psychologist Joanne Bell, there are almost always elements of distress in those affected by cancer, and mindfulness-based therapies can be effective in minimizing worry and emotional distress in patients undergoing treatments. Next month, the Australian Cancer Council is beginning an eight-week Living Mindfully program, based on mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), to help cancer patients manage stress while undergoing treatment, reported ABC Capricornia in Australia. The program meets for two hours per week, and has a strong emphasis on meditation. ""For many people who have been diagnosed with cancer -- or have been diagnosed with advanced cancer and are facing end-of-life issues -- their mind is so full of worries about the future... that they can't fully be aware and enjoy the time they have now,"" Bell tells ABC Capricornia. Emotional distress, in turn, can have a significant impact on the course of the illness. Depression has been shown to hasten decline in cancer patients, and also to increase the risk of death. By reducing stress and negative emotions, mindfulness programs could potentially play an important role in the treatment process. ""[Cancer] is very demanding on the body and the mind, so the aim of this program is to help people learn ways to focus and calm their mind, and live more fully in the present moment so they can better manage difficult thoughts and difficult feelings,"" Bell says in an interview with ABC Capricornia. A good deal of research has examined the impacts of both mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on cancer treatment. A 2012 Danish review of studies found that mindfulness-based therapies -- which include yoga, meditation, breathing exercises and mental training -- are an effective way to manage depression and anxiety in cancer patients. ""[The] summary of the study findings shows that mindfulness has a documented effect as an effective and inexpensive therapy method for cancer patients with anxiety and depression symptoms,"" an Aarhus University press release on the research stated. ""The positive effect was not only seen immediately after therapy, but was maintained for at least six months following the therapy."" A 2011 study published in the journal Cancer Nursing also found that the majority of cancer patients who participated in mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy experienced positive effects including increased calm and well-being, better sleep quality, more energy and decreased physical pain. With the research to back up the effectiveness of mindfulness in helping cancer patients, it's likely that these types of programs will continue to spread through hospitals, universities and treatment centers in the U.S. and abroad. According to Bell, the Australian programs have been been highly successful so far. ""The last two programs last year were fully booked before they even started, and all of our patients have stated that it's been a positive experience,"" Bell says in the ABC Capricornia interview. ""It's a really rewarding experience to watch the personal journey that the participants take throughout the program.""

The enduring backdrop of the attack, however, couldn't paint a clearer picture of what terrorism is truly about: attacking the very essence of what defines us as human beings. I believe that the human species couldn't be better defined than through the large, overarching tropes of achievement and community. We began as individuals, and merged into tribes, then nations, then a global community connected by technology and commerce, and ultimately, if evolution wins over terror, a truly interconnected global community.And it wasn't without achievement that this community emerged. Achievements on both the sides of technology and humanity -- of the enduring human spirit and drive to simply do more: the Internet, vaccines, space travel, The Olympics. The list goes on and on. Achievement, contribution, progress -- call it what you will, is the hub of the wheel of community.Nothing defines the human experience more than achievement and community; and both were violently attacked yesterday. If 9/11 didn't accurately paint this picture, the image of bomb smoke set against the flags of many nations preceding a finish line did.Terrorism, at its root, plays a polarity to the essence of life. If life's defining themes are achievement and community, terrorism's are destruction and fragmentation. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.""And without having this thought in mind, we saw the essence of humanity emerge immediately from the billowy darkness of bomb smoke: first responders running towards the blast site. The primal instinct to create, and not destroy, the primal instinct of community.We cannot let yesterday's attack, an assault on the essence of the human spirit, create within us fragmentation and destruction. We must continue to achieve. We must continue to come together. We must continue to be not runners, not Bostonians, and not Americans. We must continue to be the light, to love, to be...humans.For more by Jeff Halevy, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

Let me explain.",2013-04-16,Fresh coffee beans around a white coffee mug and inside of it. Shot on a wood table surface. Coffee makes for an energetic start to every morning.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0b382500003300364d9d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you drink coffee, I have some bad news and some good news. The bad news is that the more cups of coffee you drink, the higher your risk of dying early. The good news is that if you ""risk adjust,"" then the more cups of coffee you drink, the lower your risk of dying early. Let me explain.According to a 2012 study in the New England Journal of Medicine, 400,000 AARP members were followed for 14 years, with a close survey of their coffee-drinking habits, diet and death.Among men who drank six cups or more of coffee, 19 percent died early compared to 13 percent of the non-coffee drinkers. Among women who drank six cups or more of coffee, 15 percent died early compared to 10 percent of non-coffee drinkers. To an untrained person it would seem that coffee was detrimental to our health and we should stop at once.However, people are more complex. As it turns out, the heavy coffee drinkers tended to be heavy smokers, heavy drinkers and red-meat eaters, all habits that can contribute to an earlier death.So, in such situations, the statisticians do some ""tweaking"" to the data, formally called risk adjustment. This means that they take into account the higher risk of dying among smokers, drinkers and red-meat eaters and then they compare the population of coffee drinkers to coffee non-drinkers.And, voila! The risk-adjusted finding is that drinking coffee not only is not harmful but it actually may be protective, like an aspirin, and it is dose-dependant, which means the more coffee you drink the lower your chances of dying.For example, women who drank six cups or more of coffee had a 15 percent lower chance of dying early compared with those women who drank no coffee. Those who drank one cup of coffee had a 5 percent lower chance of dying than their non-coffee-drinking counterparts.So I wondered is this just a play of numbers by statisticians or a genuine scientific finding. I think it is real. To the rejoicing of java drinkers across the world, a Japanese study found nearly a 17 percent reduction in death in those who drank six cups of coffee a day compared to one-cup-a-day coffee drinkers, while a study among health professionals found a 20 percent reduction.When we look at the data in detail, heavy coffee drinkers had lower rates of heart disease, stroke, respiratory illness, diabetes and infections than non-coffee drinkers. Only cancer deaths were not lower.You may be wondering what is in the coffee that is so beneficial. It's the caffeine and the antioxidants in the coffee beans. Caffeine is found in medications for Parkinson's disease, asthma, pain and headaches. One cup of drip-brewed coffee has three and a half times the caffeine of a cup of tea.It's mainly the antioxidants that have the major health benefits, so decaffeinated coffee drinkers need not worry. Antioxidants are chemicals that protect the cells from damage, disease and aging. We are encouraged to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables because of their antioxidant content, but one cup of coffee has more antioxidants than a serving of grape juice, blueberries, raspberries or oranges.Coffee does have its down side. On a rare occasion, when I sip a cup of coffee I become a bit jittery and have to run to the restroom sooner than planned. For others, coffee causes tremulousness and increases their heart rate and blood pressure.All this news about coffee is exciting for research scientists at Vanderbilt University's Institute for Coffee Studies. (Honestly, such an institute exists as a division of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.) They study the potential therapeutic uses of coffee.One other note: The AARP study was observational, not causal. That is: It does not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. To scientifically prove that coffee reduces mortality rates, we would have to take a group, divide the participants in half, provide coffee to one group and restrict coffee from the other group and then look at mortality rates over 15 years. Obviously, no sane coffee drinkers or nondrinkers would subject themselves to such a study.Until then, this is the best scientific finding we have, which is good if you are a coffee drinker. So drink up.For more by Manoj Jain, MD MPH, click here.For more on diet and nutrition, click here."

The Boston bombings from April 15th's Boston Marathon have hit hard. Living and working in Boston makes it feel like déjà vu: it was nearly 12 years ago when I lived and worked in New York City and witnessed the events on September 11th, 2001. Although these events are scary for anyone, they seem even more so when they happen right in your backyard.The bombings caused a whole host of memories to come flooding back and I found myself reliving the confusion, the concern, the sadness, and of course, the fear, all over again. Yet, this time they took on a whole new level of meaning and significance: I'm 37 weeks pregnant.Twelve years ago, as a single woman in her late 20s, my mind jumped to my parents', my friends', and of course, my own safety. But today, only three weeks away from my due date, it is difficult not to ask: What will this mean for my child? What will this mean for the future of my family? Is it irresponsible to bring a precious, innocent life into the chaos and craziness of the world today? What if my child, one day, has the terrible fate of Martin Richard, the eight-year old boy who lost his life during yesterday's bombings?I'm sure these questions run through the minds of other new moms-to-be. How could they not? The world continues to get scarier with so many questions unanswered. How can any parent not feel the fear that stems from all we've been experiencing in the last several years? So much sadness, random acts of terror and inexplicable violence. Doesn't it seem that bringing new life into this world is irrational?As I ponder these questions, however, I constantly remind myself of this very simple and important principle: You can either live out of fear, running away from experiences, missing out on life's wonders, or you can live bravely, running towards all that life has to offer, allowing yourself to experience joy, love, and happiness, and other amazing things.Fear is debilitating. It keeps us from living life. It keeps us from doing new things. It keeps us from taking risks. It keeps us from enjoying new experiences. And it keeps us stagnant, never moving forward with our goals and our hopes for the future. Life is filled with unknowns. But fear negates our ability to see and experience all of the wondrous unknowns that are good. In truth, for every bad experience there are likely hundreds, if not thousands of good ones. If you feel doubtful, scared or fearful, try to remind yourself of the times you pushed fear aside and came out on the other end better for it. Remind yourself of the the thrill and the excitement that came with taking the risk. Relive the happiness and the joy you experienced. That is living. That is why we are here. That is what life is about and why we get up every morning.Over the next few weeks, as I wait for our impending arrival, I will continue to remind myself of these important truths and hold onto the idea that life is good. I will continue to dream about the future of our family. I will continue to relish in the joy to come. And as hard as it may be at this time, I ask you to join me. It is the positive spirit that makes life meaningful and good. Don't let anyone or anything rob you of that simple pleasure."

Sometimes, in the midst of sadness, it's possible to glimpse that, though I'm sad, not everything is sad. This poem came upon me while in such a mood.Near the LightI'm saved by what is timeless. Can taste it though it fills no cup. Can feel it though it can't be seen.Yesterday, an old brooding song was sung low, making the afternoon drop its shoulders. Even the wind circled back. I dropped my napkin, glad to feel that old ache waiting like a lucky coin I rub but seldom look at. Every- one broods and holds on to what they think is lucky.I'm saved by your laugh, which stops the crows of pleasure and pain from pecking at each other inside my head.This morning I tried three times to read something I've wanted to read for years. But you were sick and the car broke down. And waiting for the tow truck, I stood in the shade of a locust tree. The patches of sun reminded me that we've already arrived.A Question to Walk With: Identify a mood of frustration or sadness that you are currently struggling with. Without denying or minimizing your frustration or sadness, let your mind and heart open beyond your struggle and describe, if you can, life around you that is not frustrating or sad. What does it feel like to allow both to take up space in your mind and heart at the same time?For more by Mark Nepo, click here. For more Poetry for the Soul, click here. "

The last time I wrote about this awful topic was on December 15th, right after the mass shooting in Newtown. I can't believe that I have to share this information again. And so soon.One of the (many!) sequelae involved in a disaster is how to help children through this trauma. The fact that we even have to help children through something so catastrophic is unimaginable because, really, who on earth could possibly have imagined something so evil?Here are some suggestions for helping children:1. Encourage ongoing dialogue. Keep the lines of communication open at all times. 2. Listen and reassure. 3. Turn OFF the television. 4. Encourage feedback. 5. Do NOT discuss the gory details. 6. Normalize feelings, whatever they may be, whenever they may present. 7. Use the conversation as an opportunity for learning. 8. Maintain a consistent routine, because children equate a routine with stability and security.The important thing to know is that children take their coping cues from us, the trusted adults in their lives. This isn't to say that we should cover our pain. Not at all. Rather, we need to model healthy coping mechanisms for our children. Some examples include:1. Talking 2. Moderating news intake 3. Self-care (eating, sleeping, bathing) 4. Express our feelingsEach child will react in his or her own way. Children are able to hold only so much pain. During periods of intense grief and confusion, a child's inherent need to play and laugh and show joy will come through. Please allow this to happen. It is normal.During this period of grief and recovery, I hope that you will hold the children in your life tightly and love every minute that you have with them. As we have learned so tragically, every moment is indeed a gift.Here is an excellent resource that offers additional support and guidance:National Association of School Psychologists on Talking to Children About ViolenceTo read more, please find Hollye at TheSilverPen.com or email her at hollye@thesilverpen.com"
