The answer has more to do with Samuel Kazirharo than you might expect.Kaziraho is a war-weary 44-year-old who lives in the Bulengo displaced-persons camp, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. This summer he was struck by malaria, like many men in Bulengo. Fevers and chills stole 10 pounds from his frame and a month's income from his pocket. Responding to a rash of cases, Doctors Without Borders rushed to test and treat patients. But it couldn't give Kaziraho a bed net to replace his shredded one: Its nets were earmarked for pregnant women, and getting other organizations to step in was achingly slow.""The first battle is, they have to agree on the problem. Then they have to find and convince the donor,"" said Axelle Alibert, a Doctors Without Borders coordinator in Goma. ""It will be three months, then by the time they organize it they might not need it anymore.""The shortcomings of humanitarian aid are no secret to experts, and now the Ebola crisis has thrust some of them into the spotlight. Nine months after the first Ebola case emerged deep in the forests of Guinea, the global humanitarian machine has finally rumbled into action with money, promises and troops.But the health system's problems reach further than the 6,263 who've contracted Ebola. Malaria killed an estimated 627,000 people in 2012. Tuberculosis and cholera affect millions more. For those who advocate changes in the global health and emergency response system, Ebola could be a catalyst.That is, if they can look past the consuming crisis.That's a big if. But a few ideas appear to be taking shape. More aggressive intervention by international agencies like the World Health Organization (WHO). Devolution of resources and control to entities on the ground. And, over the long term, beefing up local health architecture, from medical schools to hospitals.With a record $22 billion spent on humanitarian aid in 2013, money is not the entire issue. ""It's not that there's a lack of resources, but it's that the resources aren't keeping up with the need,"" said Breanna Ridsdel, spokeswoman for the World Humanitarian Summit, slated for 2016. Like others, participants in the summit are shaping new paths for emergency health response, like smoothing clunky bureaucracy and empowering local authorities.One way forward: Get rid of the earmarks. Doctors Without Borders garnered praise for its nimble response to Ebola and willingness to work amid an epidemic that terrified public hospitals and other nongovernmental organizations into closing their doors. The organization is nimble because it has authority to spend money how it deems best. Notwithstanding the bed net Kaziharo couldn't have, the agency has fewer earmarks than other organizations, which typically depend on donors with specific priorities. When a crisis hits, they're cash-strapped.""We have our own funding, from the public, which allows us a flexible and responsive approach,"" Sandrine Tiller, Doctors Without Borders program adviser on humanitarian issues and an author of a recent biting report on the broken emergency response system, wrote in an email.The WHO was comparably lethargic, partly because of financial-crisis budget cuts, and partly because it reserves only a small portion of its $4 billion budget for crises and emergencies, about $114 million.Emergency funds are supposed to avoid earmarks and compartmentalization, and to provide a ready pool of money for pandemics or emergencies. But getting donors to commit to hypothetical emergencies is a tough sell. ""It's hard to give open-ended checks,"" said Vicky Hausman, an expert at Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a development consultancy. ""It comes back to, how do you sell that to constituents in Iowa?""There is a Central Emergency Response Fund, run by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, but it is tiny. It spent $482 million in 2013. It's disbursed an anemic $7.58 million for Ebola since April, but CERF isn't supposed to be the full humanitarian response, it's supposed to be quick.The tighter bottleneck: CERF doesn't flow to local authorities, but to U.N. agencies. Countries that receive donor resources generally can't decide how to use them. The complaint pops up repeatedly among local governments and global humanitarians alike.Partners In Health is among a handful of prominent NGOs that invest in local health structures, instead of supplanting them. It usually doesn't do emergency response, but it's making an exception for Ebola. With co-founder Paul Farmer also serving as a special Ebola adviser to the World Bank, its philosophy may have broader reach.To be sure, depending on local authorities to stop crises doesn't work everywhere. Sierra Leone, for example, was in shambles after its civil war ended a decade ago, and by 2010, the country had just two doctors per 100,000 people. But in Nigeria and Senegal, where health care systems are more robust, local authorities clamped down right away, with the support of the international community. They seem to have stopped it in its tracks.""This is why we need to invest in local health systems,"" said Hausman. The argument, she added, ""has struggled to gain traction.""Allyn Gaestel and Allison Shelley reported from Democratic Republic of the Congo with support from the International Women's Media Foundation.More from OZY: Could a Poor Diet Trigger Alzheimer's?

1,WOMEN,What It Really Feels Like To Live With Depression,"Abby Heugel, ContributorAward-winning humor writer, blogger and viral content creator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-psychological-pergatory-living-with-depression_b_5862588.html,"Just because you deal with depression doesn't mean that you are depression. A bad day/week doesn't mean a bad life. After all, it's not sunny every day but we know the clouds won't last forever.",2014-10-02,"'Are You There God, It's Me Margaret' By Judy Blume",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a53dbd1b0000f6102803c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"I've heard depression described as walking towards a sunset. You can see the light ahead of you, but even when you're basking in the warmth of the light, you're always aware that the darkness isn't more than a heartbeat away. That sounds pretty accurate, but what makes depression so hard for those on the outside -- and even those on the inside -- to understand, is that being depressed and being happy aren't always mutually exclusive. People with depression can be happy, sad or funny just like anyone else. And while we're all aware of the dangerous places depression can go, what no one seems to talk much about is that there's a kind of psychological purgatory that exists somewhere in between the high points and the end of your rope.When you're having a good day, no one can tell you're depressed because the symptoms aren't as obvious as we think they should be. You might not be feeling that miserable ""I can't get out of bed"" type of way, but your internal dialogue and view of the world is pretty similar.There's relief in knowing that you appear normal until one little thing sets you off -- a comment, an obstruction to your routine, maybe nothing specific at all -- and down that slope you go sliding again. These are the times I sit at my desk at work, feeling panic and claustrophobic with a need to literally go run away from myself. These there are the times when I'm at home on the couch, mindlessly flipping through the same websites, the same channels, feeling nothing but a need to not think. These are the times when I should reach out, but the world I created is so narrow that I retreat back into my head, to distractions, to exercise to numb out the pain. These actions become habit, the habit then becomes an obsession and from there I'm stuck in a vicious cycle again. But in some ways, as miserable as you -- well, that I -- can feel, you get used to it. Depression doesn't ask much of you other than to suffer, whereas happiness -- in as much as you can remember it -- simply can't be trusted. It's undependable and often fleeting, and while depression saps your energy, happiness is exhausting in a different way. Even though you know there are people willing to help, you can never tell them everything. Revealing the plot of your story would give away that tiny shred of control -- or the illusion of control -- that you so desperately feel that you need just to get by. Plus, seeing happy people makes you feel as if you have some kind of obligation to get well, and you don't want to have any obligations or distractions that you don't invite yourself. So instead you avoid people when you can so you don't have to make yourself vulnerable to questions, to wondering if everyone knows that you're really a big jumbled mess, unable to figure out how to get back to ""happy,"" or at the very least, back to ""content."" That's why it can be such a dangerous thing. You can appear absolutely normal and functional to the outside, but be silently screaming on the inside. And when you're down, you wonder why you can't just ""be happy"" again, and when you're happy you feel guilty for those times you're stuck in the dark. Then there's the middle -- that psychological purgatory -- neither way up or way down. These are the times to remember that isolation is a symptom, not a solution, and that flowery language aside, there still are those small shards of light. For me, sometimes it's sitting outside. Sometimes it's trying to be funny to people I see. Sometimes it's getting lost in a book or emailing someone I trust. Those things can spark the good days. Of course you have to sift through the muck and the mud, but it helps to just enjoy the good days for what they are and not question why. Life isn't easy all the time, even to the most well-adjusted individual, and the dark times aren't a reflection of weakness or selfishness or anything you might tell yourself. In other words, just because you deal with depression doesn't mean that you are depression. A bad day/week doesn't mean a bad life. After all, it's not sunny every day but we know the clouds won't last forever. Enjoy that light when you can. This is the third post in a series on depression and OCD.

2,HEALTHY LIVING,Swimming in the Hudson: An Ode to Prevention,"Dr. Derek Yach, ContributorExecutive Director of the Vitality Institute",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/swimming-in-the-hudson-an_b_5910322.html,"This is the 21st century.

We need this river to become a symbol of how we ended drowning and suicides, not a tragic reminder of the failure of prevention.",2014-10-02,"Colossal suspension bridge spanning the Hudson River which connects the neighborhood of Washington Heights on the New York Side all the way to Bergen County on the New Jersey region. I blame Daylight Savings for the inability for us to cross over. As early as 4:30pm, the sun was already setting.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e524d2400005000956d66.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over 200 swimmers completed the 7.5-mile swim Sunday, Sept. 20 in the Hudson, starting at 56th Street and ending a mile after passing under the George Washington Bridge (GWB). For many that meant spending over three hours in the powerful river. Unlike runners, we had no crowds cheering us on. There were no refreshment stations. There was no possibility of taking a break, or any certainty of how far one had swum or how much longer it would take. The few buoys helped guide us. The bridge remained a distant misty goal for what seemed like an eternity. Why do it? What do we swimmers think about?I get asked that all the time. We swim in rivers and open seas because that is what we do. But this swim is special. It is named for the Little Red Lighthouse that proudly stands at the base of the giant grey bridge and was immortalized by Hildegarde Swift and Lynd Ward in a classic children's book. As we approach the bridge we hear and feel the flow of traffic way above. And as we pass the lighthouse we know we are nearly done. As I swim, I reflect on how the waters hold their tragic stories of death. Before we passed under the GWB, 14 people had jumped to their death this year. The reasons are complex and diverse but too tragically common. This year's deaths have led authorities to build a $50 million protective fence to stop further suicides. That may stop where and how some desperate people die, but will not do much to prevent their pain. The recent announcement by the Clementi family to address the underlying reasons for their son's jump from the GWB in 2010 is a needed step forward. We swim in waters where people needlessly ended their lives. As I swim, I recall how many people have drowned in the waters of the Hudson and waters around Manhattan. A few weeks before our swim, Boyce Coleman drowned while saving the life of a 6-year-old boy with autism who fell into the river. Drowning is one of the most common causes of death in children, yet it is preventable. Swimming skills save lives, which is why the YMCA movement -- with its new president and CEO announced just recently on Sept. 30 -- makes such important efforts to reach children across the country. We should do more; schools should partner with Ys and ensure that every child has been through a basic swimming course and has the support needed to be as healthy and mentally resilient as they can be.We swim in a river where people die needlessly. They die because we undervalue prevention of drowning in kids and undervest in effective destigmatizing mental health programs. Yet we also swim in a river that receives the discharged treated sewage of millions of people. Classic public health and environmental protection allows us to swim past the massive sewage outlet before we pass under the GWB, confident we will not be infected by a dreaded disease.This is the 21st century. We need to apply our preventive focus to more than assuring we can swim in waters like the Hudson without it being a threat to our lives. We need this river to become a symbol of how we ended drowning and suicides, not a tragic reminder of the failure of prevention.---Have a story about depression that you'd like to share?

My dad says he lobbied for Angela or Angelina, but I've never had what it takes to be an Angie Rapisarda. And there are only so many times I can explain how someone with a warm Sicilian last name has skin that suggests long hours spent in dark, wood-panelled rooms eating schnitzel.So ""Jessica"" fits. Its anonymity deflects from the conspicuousness of my surname. I don't love my name, but I don't love a glass of water or a gulp of air. It does its job. Its job is important.Jess, circa May 2012Then I became pregnant, and with each passing month, as my stomach expanded, my name seemed to contract. For everyone who called me ""Jess,"" there were an equal number of folks calling me ""mom-to-be."" ""How are you feeling, mom-to-be?""""Hey there, mama-to-be. How many more months to go?""I felt excited, like a fresh-faced sorority pledge. Granted, it was the least exclusive sorority in the history of womankind, but for 36 years, I'd been watching its secret rites from a quiet, well-rested distance. ""Mom-to-be"" reminded me that others appreciated the enormity of my initiation. Yet a humble little remembrance wormed its way out of the dark to nag at me. Years before I had even met my husband, let alone married or thought of having kids, I visited a friend who was several months pregnant with her second child. We hadn't seen each other in months, not since just before she found out that her strange change in appetite was more than just a passing bug. We stood on her wraparound porch, in the bracing light of winter, looking out at the dips and curves of the valley surrounding her home. I marveled at her belly, but mostly we talked about our latest writing ventures, our families, and news of mutual acquaintances. ""It's good to talk to a friend,"" she said, ""someone who remembers your name, ya know?""I felt my brow crinkle, a look clearly indicating that I did not know.She rested her forearm across her stomach. ""People forget who you are when you become a mom. It's like they forget you're a woman, an individual even. You're suddenly just 'mom.'""And though I understood her words, I still didn't really know. But by my own second trimester, I was at least getting the gist.Jess-ish, September 2012When my son was born in early 2013, ""Jessica"" was abruptly shunted aside. But it was to be expected for a while. In the first week after his birth, I needed to hear other people say ""mother"" and know that they meant me, to be reminded that, yes, the child was mine. ""Mama loves you,"" I murmured, while rocking my newborn to sleep. Everyone was trying out the new name, like a freshly minted ""husband"" and ""wife"" on their honeymoon. The Woman Formerly Known as Jess, February 2013My dad had gently told me, when I was newly pregnant, that life would never be the same. A pretty obvious statement, if I'd ever heard one. Of course life wouldn't be the same, I thought: kids require love, food, money, space. But within a few short weeks of my son's birth, nothing seemed obvious anymore. Once I was a woman who took road trips for the hell of it. Once I was a woman who spent half of an hour each morning applying moisturizer and makeup. Once I was a woman who wrote stories, who read stories, who had time on her hands. Once I was not a mother.Between the psychological whiplash, the sleep deprivation, and the claustrophobic cold of February, I felt slightly insane. Everyone who called, stopped by, or sent a card called me ""mom"" or ""mama"" or ""mommy"" -- as though my one child had multiplied 20 times over. It took months for me to reestablish old routines (like showering) and to break free of the postpartum haze. I grieved the life I'd had before my son, but I realized that I was no less myself just because my schedule didn't permit a lengthy beauty regimen. Months rolled by, a year even, and my new world order felt a little more broken in. But coworkers, distant relatives, even the grocery store cashier still echoed the same refrain: ""How ya doin', mom?"" I thought better of being honest, of saying, ""Well, I used to go by Jessica, so I'm experiencing a pretty intense identity crisis right now.""There is no malice in ""mom."" I've used the m-word many times. ""Mom"" is shorthand for ""I acknowledge that you have a child, congratulations, welcome, try to breathe, this is going to last for at least 18 years."" But ""Jessica,"" my dime-a-dozen first name, is shorthand for something much more complex. It contains the little girl playing with Barbies and the angsty teenager playing The Cure. It holds my college years, my grad school years, and the years in between when I folded khakis at the mall for a living. There's a career in that name, a marriage, and 10 different addresses. ""Jessica"" wrote poems in her diary at 13, and ""Jessica"" wakes at 5 a.m., a few quiet hours before her son stirs in his crib, to write an essay on her laptop. ""Jessica"" contains ""mother.""I love being a mom. When I watch my son on the baby monitor, curled around his stuffed elephant, I am awed that he is of me. And I am not even bothered that my very best piece of work has already been made, that nothing I type will ever top him.There are times, though, when I am out with old friends or alone with my husband, and I hear my name, and it's as though a door swings open. And inside is a room packed with neatly labeled boxes and bins: ""First ballet recital, 1981,"" ""Trip to Madrid, 1999,"" ""Christmas with Shelby, 2012,"" ""Early mornings at the kitchen table, 2014."" And I think to myself, ""Oh, thank God, it's all still here.""This post originally appeared on Welcome to the Bundle.

Where the former see a ""fascist coup"" in Kyiv, the latter see a democratic revolution on the Maidan. Where the former see Viktor Yanukovych as a legitimate president, the latter see a corrupt and illegitimate dictator. Where the former see a belligerent NATO on the march, the latter see a weak alliance in crisis. Where the former see a civil war in eastern Ukraine, the latter see a Russian intervention.Russia and the West do not just see things differently. Their perceptions of reality are diametrically opposed; they negate each other. If the Russians are right, the West is wrong--and vice versa. Both sides cannot be right, and the two sets of views cannot be reconciled with each other. Calls for ""understanding"" the Russians and giving their views a ""fair hearing"" are thus little more than calls for abandoning one's own views. That would be justifiable, indeed right, if one's views were wrong. But it's manifestly absurd if one's views are right.There is deeper issue here. We can determine whether perceptions of reality are correct or not. Despite the insistence of radical post-modernists that all truth claims are equally invalid, reasonable people the world over know that there is a simple test of the veracity of some perception: does it actually correspond to things as they are?Did Yanukovych flee as a result of a coup by a small cabal of fascists or was he forced from power by the sustained exertions of thousands of democratically-inclined Ukrainians? The evidence overwhelmingly supports the latter view. Was Yanukovych a legitimate ruler or had his corruption and abuse of power undermined his legitimacy in the eyes of a majority of Ukrainians? Once again, the latter proposition can be easily proven. Has NATO ever expressed openly anti-Russian views or undertaken openly anti-Russian actions since the collapse of the USSR or is it an alliance without purpose, whose member states cannot imagine deploying their troops to a conflict in Europe? There is no evidence for the former claim. Are there or are there not Russian agents, soldiers, and volunteers and massive amounts of Russian military equipment in eastern Ukraine? Obviously there are.In sum, Russian perceptions of the reality are wrong. We can easily explain Russian inability to see ""straight."" Putin has embraced and propagated, almost since coming to power, an ideology of hyper-nationalism, revanchism, and neo-imperialism that builds on deep-seated Russian resentment at having lost their position of greatness in the world, promotes a paranoid worldview, and deliberately constructs enemies in order to lend his regime legitimacy.Should the West therefore try to understand Russian perceptions even if it knows that they are completely wrong? Obviously, understanding Russian delusions can help the West and Ukraine craft a better response to Putin's expansionism. But it makes little sense to say that the West and Ukraine should try to accommodate these delusions in their search for peace in eastern Ukraine and the Crimea.Should the democratic world have accommodated Hitler's perceptions of Jews? Or of Germany's need for Lebensraum? Or of the innate superiority of the Aryan race? The questions are rhetorical, but they are exactly the ones we should be asking about Russian perceptions.The implications for policy are clear. Finding a compromise under such conditions may be impossible. And agreeing to disagree may be the best one can possibly achieve. Russia currently controls the Crimea and one third of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. Let it continue to do so. The West has imposed sanctions on the Russian economy and supports Ukraine. Let it also continue to do so. Finally, Ukraine has adopted a defensive position and appears intent on preventing further Russian incursions into its territory. It, too, should continue to do so.There is no practical solution to the Russo-Ukrainian war. The most one can hope for is to ""freeze"" it and thereby transform hot war into cold war between Russia and Ukraine and between Russia and the West. That cold war will continue as long as Putin remains in power and continues to promote his delusional views of the world. Cold war may not be the West's optimal solution, but, while inconvenient for everyone, it will be infinitely preferable to a hot war."

Gainer of Harrisburg in a letter to students.Kenneth A. Gavin, director of communications for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, said the policy applies to all Catholic school students in Pennsylvania. It would not apply to Catholic university students.Under the policy, which took effect July 1, a male wrestler would either have to forfeit his match with a girl, or his team would have to persuade the other school to withdraw the girl and replace her with a boy.The bishops will not require football and rugby teams to forfeit if the opposing team included a girl.Mark E. Byers, chief operating officer for the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association, said he was aware of the new Catholic policy and that it did not violate any of the group’s regulations.Few girls participate on boys wrestling teams in Pennsylvania. The National Wrestling Coaches Association lists the state as having no female wrestlers, but Byers believes 30 or more girls may wrestle in Pennsylvania.Texas leads the nation with some 2,700 high school girls involved in wrestling, while California has just over 2,000, according to the coaches association.In 2013, a 12-year-old girl, Audriana Beattie, sued Pennsylvania's Line Mountain School District in federal court and won the right to participate on the boys wrestling team of her junior high school.Brad Skelton, Line Mountain athletic director, said Beattie wrestled once in a match last season against Shikellamy Middle School in Sunbury. “Nobody forfeited,” he said."

Only a year ago, he pointed out, he performed at the tiny Troubador club in West Hollywood and thanked the fans who came to that first show. ""I put out a pretty depressing album last year. So I sort of wallowed for a year, but I feel much better now,"" Smith, 22, said to undulating waves of applause on Tuesday night. The roar of the audience at the Greek Theater encouraged his heartfelt monologue. ""I went into the studio and thought I'd make a Beyonce album. I'm not Beyonce, if you haven't noticed,"" he joked. ""I called up someone I was really in love with and told him everything and the next day I made this song. It sort of jumpstarted everything,"" he said, as he began to play ""I Told You Now"" from his debut album ""In The Lonely Hour.""He only had the one album and his one EP to play off of at the Greek, but that didn't stop him from doing what only few male vocalists can do -- cover a Whitney Houston song.""I love female divas. I grew up listening to people like Amy Winehouse, Etta James, Beyonce,"" Smith said. ""About four months ago when we were pushing the record in New York, I was having a tough week. There was so much going on. And I decided to do something a little bit different and I did a cover of one of my favorites of all time, Ms. Whitney Houston.""Smith came out as gay in May 2014, right around the time he released his first album. In September, he told The Daily Mail that the inspiration for the soul-crushing songs was in fact the unrequited love of a straight man.""I am a happy person, believe it or not. I want a love one day. I don't want to be miserable forever,"" Smith told his fans at the Greek. ""I can't bring out 'In The Lonely Hour' part two, so I need to find someone to love me, quickly.""Based on the deafening applause, we have a feeling this will not be a problem for long."

Helmed by the amiable Kent Jones in year No. 2 as Director of Programming, the Film Society has put together a stunning lineup of must-see films, ranging from studio biggies, to art films, to cross-overs. Also on tap from the ever evolving fest are ""Evenings With"" actors/directors, revivals of classics, a Spotlight on Documentary, and the newly named Projections offering cutting-edge fare. This only skims the surface -- there's much much more to the NYFF 2014. If the organizers aim to make midtown a cinephile's mecca, they're well on their way. That said... Sometimes in a fest there emerges a confluence of similar themes and images. This is generally coincidence, as a line-up depends to some degree on which films are available, etc. When movies do ""talk to each other,"" says Kent Jones, ""that's always great."" Certainly it's fair to say that noir films, from Maps to the Stars, to Gone Girl, to Foxcatcher, dominate much of the conversation in the fest's 52nd edition. Yet I've also picked up in this year's lineup, like some background noise hard to tune out, some dispiriting portraits of women. I don't usually take this perspective. A film stands on its own merits, regardless of gender politics. Yet it's hard not to become dismayed over the repeating female image of the aging actress as trainwreck. Crazy ladies prevail! In David Cronenburg's Maps to the Stars, Julianne Moore takes this stock character around the bend and back -- and yes, won Best Actress in Cannes. Maps is a brilliant put-down, often hilarious, of a warped Hollywood that picks up where Nathaniel West's Day of the Locust left off. Cronenburg exercises spectacular control: not an iota of humanity or altruism is permitted into the frame. With its cosmic disgust, the film's an equal-opportunity offender. The male teen star is beyond grotesque, along with his huckster dad. But oy, some gallery of female monsters. Olivia Williams plays the mother from hell. Mia Wasikowska limns a homicidal, pyromanical psycho, a walking embodiment of evil. Most troubling, perhaps, is Moore's actress, who rejoices at the death of a rival's child so she herself can snag a role she covets. Maybe it's time to retire the aging actress going bonkers and stick it in cold storage. The actress as train wreck crops up again in Clouds of Sils Maria from Olivier Assayas. That said, it's a glorious, must-see film, its tone worlds apart from Maps. Unlike Moore's caricature, Juliette Binoche plays a relatable diva who's menaced by fresh young talent coming down the pike. Setting his drama against the gorgeous backdrop of Switzerland's Upper Engadine, Assayas taps into the plight of any artist struggling to keep pace with galloping change. And while Moore is made to look desperate and tatty, in Clouds the filmmaker celebrates Binoche's lushly beautiful middle age. What bothers me, though, is, well, the diva's mental fragility, a hysteria just below the surface. Are we looking at another portrait of the fading actress as walking meltdown? To be fair, Assayas leaves us (minor spoiler) with the idea that work and professionalism go a long way to making life more livable.I revere the Dardenne brothers, the integrity and social awareness of their immaculate projects. They've created indelible moments in cinema and even their less stellar work demands viewing. That said, the plot line of Two Days, One Night -- a soon-to-be-laid-off worker must convince her coworkers to forego their bonuses so she can keep her job -- plays a bit thin and repetitious. Also bothersome is that female factory workers don't usually look like Marion Cotillard. Even a dressed-down Cotillard sporting cheap tank tops and the slumped posture of defeat looks suspiciously like she's just done Pilates. Worse, her character is so emotionally fragile -- in fact, a teary mess who attempts suicide -- it's her husband who repeatedly gives her the strength to persevere.Curiously, the above films were made by men. Perhaps women filmmakers are less eager to foreground weepy weak sisters and poster girls for ungracious aging. But what to make of the dubious sexual politics of Gone Girl from the best-seller by Gillian Flynn? With its he says/she says structure, the novel is a technical tour de force. Its literate language and smartass dialog place it several cuts above your average potboiler.But in the film -- for all the verbiage about Rosamund Pike's breakout, and I wish her well -- the portrait of anti-heroine Amy Dunn is above all distasteful. And it's a damn shame, frankly, that the vehicle for an actress' breakout is a role like this. Ben Affleck as Amy's husband comes off as a passive-aggressive heel who -- maybe deservedly -- becomes entrapped by the hell on wheels that is Amy. But Pike's Amy is the quintessential woman scorned, a tired trope if ever there was one, the latest spin on Fatal Attraction, another ringing testimonial for women. Novels evoke through language; violence can be somewhat oblique. But in film you get in-your-face visuals in living color. So when Gone Girl's director, David Fincher, cuts to the nitty-gritty of Amy's machinations, including the urine scam, followed by an act of savagery that's no more watchable for being admirably shot... give me a break. You can talk all you like about technical skill -- this is deep misogyny. And whatever happened to the film's framing suggestion that economic shutdown can become a catalyst for interpersonal mayhem? At the press screening I attended, by the way, some viewers laughed, and not at the right moments.As an antidote to the above female portraits, I'd recommend the lush, riveting German movie Beloved Sisters from Domink Graf. A period piece set in the 1800s that feels entirely of the moment, Beloved follows two sisters as they engineer a love triangle with poet Friedrich Schiller, object of both their affections. The divine looking Florian Stetter is a dead ringer for Schiller, and the two actresses possess a kind of natural, faintly irregular beauty that you rarely find among Hollywood's photoshopped faces. Graf guides the sisters through a fascinating ménage a trois, giving us a heady portrait of women who flout the strictures of their time to become agents of their own destiny. Talk about designing women!"

This is a tragic error. One of the worst mistakes the United States can make is to respond to the horrors of the conduct of ISIS, especially its wanton killing of civilians, by killing civilians in response. We are meeting horror with horror and it will come back to haunt us, both morally and strategically. In the peace movement, we say 'When you mirror your enemy, you risk becoming your enemy.' The U.S. is now on that path and it is a profound moral mistake. In addition, this new information from the White House undermines a substantial part of the argument for the morality of the drone program, since the drone program has been sold to the American people as a way for the U.S. to kill terrorists without substantially endangering local populations. For the administration to claim it is ""just"" to use drones, it must abide by the rules for the conduct of war. These rules, called ""Just War Theory,"" specifically call for the protection of civilians, i.e. non-combatants, from armed combat. In this theory on waging war it is considered unfair and unjust to attack indiscriminately since non-combatants or innocents are deemed to stand outside the field of war proper. We are supposed to be operating under a new drone policy where protecting civilians is a priority. The President acknowledged civilian deaths in his major 2013 speech on drones at the National Defense University , calling them ""a tragedy."" In that speech, the President promised the drone program would operate within limits protecting civilians, and that in addition to control of the drone program being transferred from the CIA to the Pentagon, a new era of transparency on drones would begin. This has now been shown to be more a rhetorical and less actual policy shift.Given the secretive nature of the drone program, accurate information on the number of civilians killed in drone strikes has always been very difficult to obtain. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism in the United Kingdom has attempted to document the deaths of civilians credibly killed by drones strikes, including women and children, and their research has included the disturbing information of targeting of rescue personnel and funerals.More recently, strikes on a Syrian village, a reported stronghold of an al-Qaida-linked front, resulted in images of bodies of women and children hauled from the rubble. Images of badly injured children also appeared on YouTube, helping to fuel anti-U.S. protests in a number of Syrian villages last week.At a briefing for members and staffers of the House Foreign Affairs Committee late last week, a political member of one of the Free Syria Army factions described the aftermath of this attack. ""They were carrying bodies out of the rubble. ... I saw seven or eight ambulances coming out of there.""  He went on to say, ""We believe this was a big mistake.""Yes, this was a big mistake. It was a moral mistake and a strategic mistake. It is not acceptable for the President to claim a moral principle such as the Just War criterion on protecting civilians, and then bend or break that principle when it seems expediency demands it. The point of moral principles is to accept there are things that cannot be morally justified and then refrain from doing them. But it is also a ""big mistake"" from a strategic standpoint to be killing civilians. ISIS is waging an image war and demonizing the U.S. is a cornerstone of their propaganda. Giving ISIS more fuel for their hype is strategically a huge error. That YouTube video serves to undermine whatever support the U.S. and others bombing ISIS targets may have. No matter what the enemy does, and how immorally they may act, that does not provide a free pass for individuals or nations to just give up on their own principles and respond in kind. In fact, it is precisely when your moral principles are tested that abiding by them is most crucial. Otherwise, what is it we are really fighting for?LOOK: Nearly 200 Faith Leaders Condemn President’s Lifting of Civilian Protections in Syria Strikes  "

An Istanbul University student also told The WorldPost that an altercation had taken place.The incident is the third time in the last week that hostilities have been reported on campus between groups protesting for and against the militant group, also known as ISIS or ISIL.On Sept. 26, masked students carrying nail-studded planks attacked classmates who had set up a stand denouncing the group’s extremist ideology and brutality. The incident was caught on video. Students criticized the university's security personnel for failing to prevent the attack and protect the students, according to Hurriyet Daily News, a popular Turkish news site.Rumors are running wild in the country and abroad about Turkey’s murky relationship with the Islamic State, which has attracted international attention in recent months thanks to its rapid territorial gains and its brutal tactics. The Turkish government has been criticized for failing to prevent the frequent smuggling of fighters in and out of Syria and for not curbing Islamic State recruiting within Turkey. Much of Turkey's 500-mile border with Syria is porous, allowing participants in Syria's civil war to cross the border to fight or to base themselves in southeast Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has slammed reports of Turkey turning a blind eye to Islamic State recruitment in Ankara as a “smear campaign.” The government says it is doing everything in its power to put an end to extremist activity. The Islamic State in June took 46 Turkish citizens hostage from the Turkish Consulate in Mosul, Iraq, dragging Turkey even deeper into the war on its borders. The hostages' mysterious release in late September, and the government's refusal to give details on how their freedom was secured, has sparked even more rumor. Meanwhile, over 1.5 million Syrian refugees are seeking refuge in Turkey, with the government struggling to support the massive -- and growing -- refugee population. At a meeting of the World Economic Forum in Istanbul on Monday, Ibrahim Kalin, Erdogan's chief policy adviser, told reporters and aid workers that Turkey would maintain an open border for refugees until the Syrian war ended, however long that takes.One 23-year-old communications major at Istanbul University told The WorldPost by phone that she didn't think the school administration or the government were doing enough to crack down on the militant group, despite the arrest of pro-Islamic State protesters on Wednesday.“I think the police just came because of the media,” said the student, who gave her name only as Beril. “To say, 'See, we arrested them.’ But I think they’ll release them in a day.”Beril said that many of her friends have recently joined protests against the extremist group, despite attacks and hostility from a small number of students who support the Islamic State. “They can do anything,” Beril said of the Islamic State and its supporters. “If you say something wrong, they can attack you. It’s really scary.”"

The epidemic has killed at least 3,000 people in the region.""Now, thousands of people in these (three) countries are dying because, in the lottery of birth, they were born in the wrong place,"" World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in prepared remarks at Howard University in Washington.""This ... shows the deadly cost of unequal access to basic services and the consequences of our failure to fix this problem.""Kim, the first public health expert to lead the World Bank, said the development institution was committed to addressing income inequality as well as the inequality of access to things like food, clean water and healthcare.Kim spoke ahead of the IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington next week, where the bank will focus on its goal of shared prosperity, or boosting the incomes of the poorest 40 percent of people in each country.The World Bank has devoted $400 million to fight the spread of Ebola and improve health systems in West Africa. It estimated the outbreak could sap billions of dollars from economies in the region by the end of next year if it is not contained.After a slow initial response, foreign governments - including the United States, Britain, France, China and Cuba - are also now providing funds, supplies and personnel to the affected parts of West Africa.But health experts said the assistance was still insufficient and not arriving quickly enough to halt the spread of the deadly hemorrhagic fever.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated last week that, in a worst-case scenario, the number of infections could reach 1.4 million late January, compared with about 6,000 today.Kim said the delays in fighting Ebola echoed past problems in quickly getting effective treatment for HIV to Africa.""It has been painful to see us replay old failures from previous epidemics,"" Kim said. ""Concerned citizens need to demand immediate deployments of capital and human resources to the affected countries.""Otherwise, thousands more will die needless deaths and an economic catastrophe may take place.""
