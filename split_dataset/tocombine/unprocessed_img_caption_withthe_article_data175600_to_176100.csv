They refuted Wilbon's characterizations.. and then it was on. Initially, Wilbon walked back his comments a bit.

(AP Photo/Bill Haber)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6b6972100002501c8ca77.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dave Miller, National Football Post  Week 5 is in the books, and Week 6 kicked off Thursday night with USC trying to keep alive its BCS title hopes with a win on the road against Utah.The SEC takes centerstage this week, with Florida and South Carolina looking to take care of business at home against LSU and Georgia, respectively. Meanwhile, Nebraska looks to steal a road win at the Horseshoe in Columbus against Ohio State.So once again, dust off that grill and get it fired up because we’re starting this weekend’s tailgate.The marquee matchupsLSU at FloridaX-Factor: Tigers defensive line vs. Gators offensive line...One of the issues Florida head coach Will Muschamp was concerned with heading into his second year in Gainesville was the play of his offensive line. He wanted the unit to be more physical, which would help protect quarterback Jeff Driskel and open up running lanes for tailback Mike Gillislee. So far, the O-Line has looked like a completely different unit than the one we saw in 2011. It has helped get the Gators off to an undefeated start. However, it faces a different animal this week when it matches up against a Bayou Bengals line that is arguably the best in the nation.Georgia at South CarolinaX-Factor: The health of Connor Shaw...The Gamecocks quarterback has shown the last couple of weeks that he won't let his injured throwing shoulder affect him while he's on the field. He has shown that he can still run the ball effectively, and the Gamecocks need that rushing ability from the quarterback position even with star running back Marcus Lattimore getting more and more comfortable coming off of his knee injury. But against the Bulldogs, Shaw will be facing a physical defense that will bring a lot of consistent heat Shaw's way. If the 'Dawgs crowd the line of scrimmage to try to stop Lattimore, who has been effective against Mark Richt's squad in the past, Shaw will need to make plays in the passing game. And in passing situations, that's when Shaw will see the occasional blitz. He needs to avoid a lot of hits in this one or else Steve Spurrier may have to get Dylan Thompson ready if Shaw re-injures the shoulder. Also keep an eye on South Carolina's secondary, which will need improved play in order to stop the potent Georgia passing attack, led by Aaron Murray.West Virginia at TexasX-Factor: The Longhorns' ground game...Prolific quarterback Geno Smith will get his yards and the Mountaineers will score their points. The Longhorns have given up five touchdowns of 40 yards or longer this season, while Smith is still throwing touchdowns as of this moment against the Baylor defense. Even if Longhorns coordinator Manny Diaz has a defense that is able to generate pressure while just rushing four and dropping back seven, WVU will be able to move the ball as it did last season against LSU. But when Texas has the football, it will want to control the tempo of the game, especially if it is able to grab a lead. And that's where Joe Bergeron, the bruiser, and Johnathan Gray, the dynamic freshman, will come into play. Longhorns quarterback David Ash will be able to move the ball through the air against the Mountaineers' defense, but grounding it out will also keep the clock moving and Dana Holgorsen's offense off of the field.Nebraska at Ohio StateX-Factor: Nebraska's defensive line trying to stop Braxton Miller...The Cornhuskers’ front seven, led by defensive tackle Baker Steinkuhler and middle linebacker Will Compton, will catch a break because Buckeyes tailback Jordan Hall will miss this game with a partially torn ligament in his right knee. And fellow backs Carlos Hyde, Rod Smith and Bri’onte Dunn don't give the Buckeyes that burst for their rushing attack. However, Braxton Miller has proven that he can be a one-man show when there has been no other productive Buckeye on the ground. But while Miller has the ability to carry a team, the Buckeyes saw him get hit a lot last week against Michigan State. And this week they'll be seeing a Nebraska front that played very well last week against Wisconsin, especially in the second half when it contained Montee Ball. OSU can't afford too many hard hits on its star, because he was banged-up last week by the Spartans.Miami vs. Notre Dame (Soldier Field)  For a look at the Hurricanes-Fighting Irish series from a historical perspective, check out my post from Friday at the NFP.Both the 'Canes and Irish enter this matchup riding high. Al Golden's squad is sitting at 3-0 in the ACC and has bounced back nicely from the debacle on the road against Kansas State. Meanwhile, Brian Kelly's team looks to remain unbeaten and in the hunt for a BCS bid despite a difficult slate.Keep an eye on that young Irish secondary, which has yet to really be tested. Hurricanes quarterback Stephen Morris is having a breakout campaign, and he has skill all around him in sophomore receivers Phillip Dorsett and Rashawn Scott as well as running backs Duke Johnson and Mike James.Other games to keep an eye onFlorida State at N.

The 1988 showdown between No. 4 Notre Dame and top-ranked Miami (FL) at Notre Dame Stadium in South Bend remains an epic clash in the minds of many college football fans across the country.It was Good vs. Evil, Midwestern choirboys vs. South Beach renegades, Catholics vs. Convicts. The idea behind the “Catholics vs. Convicts” theme came from a Notre Dame student who coined the phrase for a t-shirt. The student began printing a plethora of these shirts with the slogan written on them, and they sold like hotcakes during the buildup for the Top 5 showdown.The pre-game fight between the two teams outside of the entrance tunnel lead credence to the slogan on the shirts. Both the players and coaches on the respective teams wanted the victory badly. Perhaps the fan bases wanted the win even more.Notre Dame had embarassed Miami from 1971 through 1980, winning 10 straight games by an average margin of 23 points. However, Howard Schnellenberger and Jimmy Johnson changed the game for the 'Canes. From 1981 through 1987, Miami went 5-1 against Notre Dame, with the Canes’ average margin of victory being 28 points.However, on that bright, sunny day in 1988, the Fighting Irish claimed a 31–30 victory, and Lou Holtz's squad went on to win the 1988 national championship.Good trumped Evil, just like in all of the fables we read growing up.Miami went on to beat the Irish 27-10 in the Orange Bowl the next year, while ND claimed a 29-20 victory in South Bend in 1990. However, the series sadly ended.But because of ND's win in 1988 and the fact that ""good"" triumphed over ""evil,"" the ""Catholics vs. Convicts"" theme has lived on. Of course, when the Irish claimed a victory over the Hurricanes in the Sun Bowl on December 31, 2010, neither team capped off the standout seasons they had been used to when they were both powerhouses in the 1980's. And while Saturday night's clash at Chicago's Soldier Field may not be between two Top 5 powerhouses, it's a huge game for both schools because of the direction they want to take this fall and into the future.“Catholics vs. Convicts” it is not, but the two teams' combined 8-1 record make this game intriguing nonetheless. And for many Irish fans everywhere, they likely can't help but think back to the epic clash in 1988 and smile.Email dave.miller@nationalfootballpost.com or follow me on Twitter at Miller_Dave"

But when, one afternoon in 2008, I stopped by the movie studio my then-boyfriend, John, helps run and saw ""Sex and the City movie shoot - fashion show scene"" written in his calendar, I made an exception. At 26, I had seen every episode of every season--twice--and the idea that I wouldn't be cast as an extra seemed impossible. It took some convincing, but John agreed to arrange it.  A smile hijacked my face from my (first) morning coffee on the day of the shoot. Designers had transformed the space into an elaborate Bryant Park tent showcasing a Vivienne Westwood fashion show during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. Five rows of matching white stadium seating lined the runway, which ran down the center of the large room. A huge stage held ground to my left.  Sarah Jessica Parker, sitting pretty in a fluffy silver dress, huddled with a fur-coated Kim Cattrall a row in front of me. Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis flanked them, both draped in dark hues. I squinted at the bright pin lighting as we awaited instruction. John took the microphone just as shooting was to begin, and I settled in for a ""thanks for being here"" kind of speech.  ""Thanks to everyone for coming today,"" John said, and I smiled. ""Today is a special day for me because my girlfriend, Rachel, is in the audience. It was Rachel's dream to be an extra in Sex and the City, and now I hope she makes my dream come true""--he was down on one knee at this point, an open Tiffany box in his hand--""by marrying me."" Sure wish I'd known about this before I had decided to call in sick to work that morning.  I don't remember saying yes. I meant to, of course, and I must have, because within seconds all I could see were 300 extras, actors, and crew members on their feet, their clapping and stomping deafening my thoughts. Sarah Jessica Parker rushed over to examine my new bling. I stopped worrying about calling in sick to work.   Our fifteen minutes of fame--which the assistant director, in her effort to keep the production on time and on budget, whittled down to eight--ended fast. A 16-hour shoot day followed, filled with takes, re-takes, and bribes to get Lil' Kim, who made a deleted cameo, out of her dressing room. I went home exhausted but content.  Though John and I had never had an actual, filled-with-words conversation about marriage, we had been together for almost three years and had discussed where we might live long-term, our career goals, and future children's names. I had shied from ever broaching the subject because I hadn't wanted John to confuse a conversation for a suggestion, or a suggestion for an ultimatum, or an ultimatum for a reason to leave. I had seen so many friends jeopardize relationships with deadlines and demands. One had even left a printed itinerary of how she envisioned a proposal in her boyfriend's briefcase. And while such behavior is effective for certain couples at certain times, it wasn't us. I wanted John to propose--but I wanted him to do it when and how he felt was right.  ""Sex and the City"" was when. ""Sex and the City"" was how. And if it took a little begging on my part to get us there, well, I could live with that.Below, Rachel and her now-husband on their Big Day. "

She's even a tech expert on “Katie” and now her fans can buy Brit Kits -- boxes filled with crafting materials that are shipped to their doors monthly. So, could Morin really make our favorite golden girl obsolete? She recently said in an interview with the LA Times that though she loves Stewart, she can sometimes be unrelatable. ""I love Martha Stewart but she is 71 years old,” she said. ""Girls in their twenties might not consider her a peer.”But we beg differ. While we love the idea of being introduced to fresh crafters, Stewart definitely holds a place in our hearts. And according to the San Francisco Chronicle, Stewart is getting more involved in the web with videos for Hulu, AOL and YouTube. And it even suggests the reason that “The Martha Stewart Show"" was canceled was largely due to the fact that the Hallmark Channel's demographic is an older crowd, while Stewart is more appealing to youngsters. And let’s face it, she’s BFFs with Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds -- can’t really get more relevant than that.Have something to say?

Starting in October and continuing through the next 90 days, many households dramatically increase their spending: Halloween requires candy and decorations and costumes (and, probably more candy if you ate the first batch); Thanksgiving requires turkey and all the fixings (and maybe more candy); Black Friday is a spend-happy time to get great deals on gifts (and on the things you've been wanting to buy all year); Christmas requires gifts, stockings and more.Those are just the ""regular"" days that most people celebrate. If your family has a birthday or celebrates other social or religious holidays during this time, it increases spending even more. Your expenses might also rise this time of year as you run your furnace, put winter tires on the car, and book a vacation to a warmer climate. October through December is 90 days of fun, festivity, candy and turkey -- it's also 90 days of spending.If you're not paying cash for everything, credit cards are the easiest way to spend during this season.There's also another reason that your credit score hates this season: Everyone is so busy with special events and pageants and banquets and holiday parties that we tend to put a lot of our good habits on hold -- including the good habit of focusing on maintaining and boosting our credit scores.By the time January rolls around, we realize that we need to tack ""Rebuild credit"" onto our New Year Resolutions -- somewhere between ""Lose the holiday weight"" and ""Eat less candy.""Fortunately, your credit doesn't have to suffer this season. Along with adopting careful spending habits, make sure you follow these simple tips to ensure that your credit has a festive season too:  Carefully use your credit cards to keep those accounts active but never put more onto your card than you can afford to pay off. Schedule time to work on your credit score and stick to your schedule! (Why not achieve two goals at once? For every candy you steal from the Halloween bowl by the door, you need to spend an extra 5 minutes working on your credit score). Remember that even small credit decisions you make now now can have big repercussions in the new year.  This is a time of year that many people look forward to, but it's too easy to put the responsibility of working on our credit until later. Resist the temptation of ignoring your credit for the rest of 2012, and you'll give yourself a gift that will reward you all year-long next year!This article originally appeared on Credit.com.

Obama and Romney each have a specific mission for the string of three debates that starts Wednesday night, Oct. 3, 2012. Obama, no longer the fresh face of 2008, must convince skeptical Americans that he can accomplish in a second term what he couldn't in his first: restore the U.S. economy to full health. Romney, anxious to keep the race from slipping away, needs to instill confidence that he is a credible and trusted alternative to the president, with a better plan for strengthening the fragile economy.
