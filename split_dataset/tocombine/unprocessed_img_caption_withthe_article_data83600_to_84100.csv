That result is well below the 27 percent figure GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney walked away with after the 2016 presidential election. Romney’s performance was the worst among Latino voters by a presidential candidate since Bob Dole’s unsuccessful run in 1996. Trump’s poor performance likely owes to a recent spate of insulting comments toward Mexican migrants, whom he baselessly portrayed in broad strokes as “rapists” who are “bringing drugs” and “bringing crime,” though he also said “some are good people.” The poll showed that 90 percent of respondents had heard about Trump’s comments. In an interview with NBC News last week, the billionaire real estate tycoon defended his comments and said that he would win the Latino vote because he would be better than the other candidates at creating jobs.""If I get the nomination, I'll  win the Latino vote,"" Trump said in the interview. ""I will win it because I'll create jobs. Hillary Clinton will not be able to create jobs. Neither is Jeb Bush going to create jobs. I will create jobs and the Latinos will have jobs that they don't have right now, and I will win that vote.""Despite his confidence, Trump is performing terribly among Latino voters, according to the poll. Eighteen months away from the 2016 presidential election, 71 percent of respondents say they have an unfavorable view of him -- a figure 8 points higher than Romney’s unfavorability among Hispanic voters in the final week ahead of the 2012 presidential election, according to polling by Latino Decisions. Not only are Hispanic voters not enthused about casting a ballot for Trump, they also largely support the decision made by several major companies to stop doing business with him. The new poll found that 74 percent of respondents either strongly or somewhat agreed with the choices by companies including Univision, NBC and Macy’s to end their business relationship with Trump.While Trump’s comments appear to have turned Hispanic voters against him, there’s a silver lining for the Republican Party. Some 61 percent of respondents said they thought his comments reflected his views alone rather than those of the GOP more generally. Only 14 percent said the comments reflected the views of the Republican Party. Another 18 percent said Trump’s comments represented the views of both the candidate and the party.The Univision National Hispanic Voter Survey carried out two sets of live phone interviews of 1,400 registered Latino voters from June 12 to June 25 and from July 7 through July 13.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) celebrated NASA's successful spacecraft visit to Pluto this week.The images that New Horizons captured ""represent a historic achievement for U.S. space exploration,"" said Rubio in a statement. ""My hope is that many young people across this country and the world will see these images of Pluto and feel that American science, ingenuity and daring are alive and well.""""Space exploration is and has always been an important venture for our country,"" the 2016 Republican contender continued. ""It opens the door for an unparalleled level of innovation, research and understanding. By investing in our nation’s brightest scientists and ambitious endeavors, we can accomplish ground-breaking space missions like this probe visit to Pluto.""But Rubio has voiced support for budgets, such as the 2012 budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), that included funding cuts for NASA in the past -- cuts that NASA said could imperil core programs. He's argued for maintaining funding at sequester levels, which would have meant major funding cuts for the agency. In July 2013, Rubio also co-sponsored a failed amendment to the markup of the NASA authorization bill within the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee that would have kept agency funding at sequestration levels. The senator from Florida acknowledged that this was a contradiction to the usual hometown protectionism.""This is my first NASA authorization bill, and being a senator from Florida, that means a lot,"" he said, according to the website Space Politics. ""It’s unfortunate that my first vote on this may be a partisan one.""To be fair, budget plans that have taken an ax to NASA's funding have most often targeted their work with planet Earth -- specifically, climate change. Those proposals have maintained funding for space exploration while cutting earth sciences spending.While NASA is one of the country's leading scientific agencies in advancing our understanding of climate change, Rubio shuns the findings of the agency's scientists. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,"" Rubio said last year.Democrats pointed to the disconnect as evidence of hypocrisy. ""Marco Rubio says he wants to launch us into the future -- but the gravitational pull of his backward anti-science agenda is going to suck us into a black hole,"" said Christina Freundlich, southern regional press secretary for the Democratic National Committee.Rubio's Senate office and campaign spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.

Ohio's Republican attorney general is also probing Planned Parenthood in his state.In response, two House Democrats came out in support of Planned Parenthood on Thursday.“The video does not demonstrate that Planned Parenthood is ‘selling’ fetal tissue,” judiciary committee ranking member John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Steve Cohen of Tennessee said in a joint statement.They said portions of the full video contradicted allegations against Planned Parenthood, but these were edited out of the widely circulated nine-minute version.Richards said Planned Parenthood stood by its work helping women to donate tissue for ""lifesaving"" research.""We know the real agenda of organizations behind videos like this,"" she said.

According to the Energy Information Administration, most of what's left, 9.1 billion tons, can only be realistically gotten by surface or ""strip"" mining. Around here, the most cost-effective method is ""mountaintop removal,"" in which the hills are blasted apart to expose the coal beneath. But stricter interpretation of clean water and other regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency and the courts in recent years has all but ended the practice. (AP Photo/David Goldman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Department of the Interior issued long-awaited regulations on Thursday for protecting streams from the adverse effects of surface coal mining.The proposed rules, issued by the department's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, mark the first major update to the surface mining regulations in 32 years. They will require coal companies to do before and after environmental analysis at mining sites, mandate that companies invest in restoration work like replanting trees, and increase requirements for monitoring of impacts during mining operations. The rules have been in the works for six years.""A lot has changed since rules were written in the early 1980s,"" said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell in a call with reporters on Thursday. The new regulations, she said, prioritize ""protecting and restoring the environment while helping meet the nation's energy needs.""Janice Schneider, the assistant secretary for land and minerals management, described the proposed regulations as ""commonsense and straightforward reforms"" that are ""guided by the best available science and take advantage of the advances in mining technology.""Eight environmental groups said in a joint statement that while the proposed rules will update stream protections in some important ways, they will also undermine previous rules that called for a 100-foot buffer zone to keep mining away from streams. The George W. Bush administration had sought to get rid of the buffer zone protections, and environmental groups have fought those rollbacks.""It is the responsibility of the Office of Surface Mining and state authorities to protect drinking water and wildlife habitat from the catastrophic effects of mountaintop removal mining. This proposal, though it does encourage increased safety monitoring and stream restoration, just doesn’t do the job,"" said Jane Davenport, senior staff attorney at the group Defenders of Wildlife, in the statement. “What we need are strong and well-defined mining rules that ensure the health of our nation’s lands and waters.""Jewell said on the call that the rules seek to take into account local conditions when establishing limits on mining, rather than setting a single national standard. The buffer ""may be less in some places, may be more in others depending on hydrology and geology,"" said Jewell.""At first glance, the draft appears to improve some drastically outdated provisions of an ineffective rule,"" said Thom Kay, a legislative associate with the group Appalachian Voices. ""But it’s not worth cheering for the rule as long as it allows companies to continue dumping their mining waste in our streams.""Meanwhile, Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) deemed it a ""job-crushing, anti-coal rule"" and said he would work to advance legislation that would ""halt this assault on affordable electricity and coal jobs across the country.""The department's economic forecasts predict the rules will likely result in the loss of 460 coal jobs, Jewell said, but will create 250 jobs in restoration efforts. The rules will be open for public comment for 60 days. The department said it anticipates finalizing the rules next year."

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- When Attorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the NAACP convention in Philadelphia on Wednesday evening, she tried to thread a needle on the complex topic of race and policing that at times resulted in over-the-top allegations that frustrated her predecessor, Eric Holder. Lynch, who was confirmed in April, had signaled that she wanted to set a new tone for the Justice Department and boost the morale of police officers who may feel their profession is under attack. Despite the fact that Holder, the nation's first African-American attorney general, spent most of his career in law enforcement or as a judge -- former President Ronald Reagan actually nominated him to the bench, where he spent years sentencing people who committed crimes in the District of Columbia to prison -- the former top law enforcement official in the United States often came under attack for being against the police.A tweet from ""Fox & Friends"" a few months ago suggested that when Holder said it might be necessary to dismantle the Ferguson Police Department -- which was found to routinely abuse citizens -- what he meant was that someone should shoot two cops in Ferguson. Holder, whose brother is a former police officer, was also accused by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani of helping create an environment where two NYPD officers could be ambushed and killed. Former New York Gov. George Pataki said he was ""sickened"" by Holder's ""divisive anti-cop rhetoric."" Sen. Lindsey Graham said he blamed the shooter for the death of two officers, but said the rhetoric that Holder and Mayor Bill de Blasio were using ""incites crazy people.""Yet a few months back, another top law enforcement official who was appointed by President Barack Obama gave a major speech on race, and didn't seem to receive the same type of criticism. FBI Director James Comey, who just like Holder has spent much of his career in law enforcement, said that throughout American history, law enforcement enforced ""a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups"" and said that today, many people in our ""white-majority culture have unconscious racial biases and react differently to a white face than a black face.""Comey, a white Republican who has donated to the presidential campaigns of John McCain and Mitt Romney, said law enforcement officials ""must redouble our efforts to resist bias and prejudice. We must better understand the people we serve and protect -- by trying to know, deep in our gut, what it feels like to be a law-abiding young black man walking on the street and encountering law enforcement. We must understand how that young man may see us. We must resist the lazy shortcuts of cynicism and approach him with respect and decency.""The Huffington Post asked Comey during a roundtable with reporters last week if he got any pushback from law enforcement after his speech suggesting that law enforcement in 2015 was still heavily impacted by racial biases.""No,"" Comey said. ""Literally none."" We asked Comey why he believed Holder got more pushback than he did. ""He's not as good a speaker as I am,"" Comey joked.Holder, who recently re-joined the law firm of Covington & Burling, certainly took note of the disparity.“Oh you noticed that, huh?” Holder asked when The Huffington Post questioned him during an interview last week about why he believed Comey had received no criticism for similar comments. “I was struck by that as well.""Holder said Comey ""showed a lot of guts to say what he said, to say it in the way that he said it,"" and also complemented New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton for his speech on race and policing.""I applaud them for being brutally honest about the nature of the problem that we confront. I was also struck by the fact that neither of them [got] the criticism that I received for saying very similar things,"" Holder said. ""This goes to the political way in which certain people are viewed. It’s just kind of the nature of the system.""What Comey and Bratton said ""are things that people in law enforcement and in our nation need to take to heart in order to build up the trust that must exist between law enforcement and communities of color,"" Holder said.""These are man-made problems that are susceptible to man-made solutions, but it’s going to take that kind of tough honesty that they, and I, talked about,"" he added.As for the criticism Holder received, the former attorney general called himself a ""huge supporter of people in law enforcement"" and said the suggestion that he wasn't supportive of police officers was ""totally inconsistent with how I was raised, both professionally and personally, inconsistent with what I did as attorney general in coming up with ways in which we protected the lives of law enforcement -- when we had that spate of law enforcement killings -- and just the respect that I have for the men and women in blue.""""My career has been in law enforcement,"" Holder said. ""When you raise tough issues within the family, some family members react very negatively. It was disappointing to me to be portrayed in that way, and it angered me also because, like I said, it was inconsistent with not only how I feel but inconsistent with what I did as attorney general."""
8,SPORTS,Top U.S. Soccer Official Pledges To Push For Better Pay For Women,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-soccer-pay_us_55a6e338e4b04740a3def4de,"Not necessarily equal with the men's pay, but better.",2015-07-16,"VANCOUVER, BC - JULY 05: The United States celebrates after winning the FIFA Women's World Cup Canada 2015 5-2 against Japan at BC Place Stadium on July 5, 2015 in Vancouver, Canada.

But it also veered into another hot topic for the sport: disparities in pay between male and female players, an issue that hit the headlines after the U.S. Women’s National Team won the World Cup earlier this month.For their victory, the American women earned $2 million in prize money, a pittance compared to the $35 million that Germany’s men collected for winning their World Cup a year ago and just a quarter of the earnings that the U.S. Men’s National Team won for reaching the tournament’s round of 16. The gender gap led to widespread criticism of FIFA and online campaigns calling for more equal pay.Those campaigns have an ally in U.S. Soccer, the governing body of American soccer, according to one of its top officials.At Wednesday's hearing before a Senate Commerce subcommittee, U.S. Soccer CEO Dan Flynn said the federation wants to use its power -- and U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati’s seat on FIFA’s Executive Committee -- to push for more opportunities for women soccer players, and better compensation too.“We are a strong advocate for the women’s game,” Flynn said in response to a question from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), the committee’s top Democrat. “We will continue ... to push for continued development on the women’s side. And one of those items would be an increase in compensation for those competing and participating teams in the World Cup and other competitions as well.”Flynn did not commit to equal pay. But he said he had met with top officials from Canada’s soccer federation during the World Cup’s final weekend to discuss the preparation of a post-event report about different issues around the Canada tournament. In those conversations, he said he brought up compensation and other areas that had drawn criticism, including the housing of opposing teams in the same hotel (which doesn’t happen with the men's teams).Flynn did not speak to the media after the hearing, and U.S. Soccer did not immediately respond to a request for further details about how it could push FIFA toward greater payouts for women’s teams. During the hearing, Flynn said the federation would advocate through Gulati’s position on FIFA’s Executive Committee, which awards and oversees major tournaments.Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) also pressed Flynn about the disparity in pay for women’s soccer players. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) introduced a resolution calling for equal pay in international soccer on Monday.FIFA dictates the total pot of prize money handed out at its events. Payouts from the men’s and women’s World Cups go directly to the federation, Flynn said. The American teams are compensated based on separate collective bargaining agreements they have negotiated with U.S. Soccer.The disparities between men’s and women’s soccer were a recurring theme throughout the latest World Cup cycle. The issue drew attention in 2014 when multiple women's teams, including Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago, struggled to fund trips to the United States for World Cup qualifying. And in March, FIFA released its own report about the lack of investment in women’s soccer worldwide. It has pledged to foster greater investment in and more opportunities for women and girls who want to play and work in the sport."

The celebrity mogul's entire brand rests on his wealth -- including his hotels, yachts, clubs and even the $100 million luxury jet that contains a gold-plated toilet. So why, then, did some of his supporters feel inclined to donate to his presidential campaign in recent weeks, given that he could probably finance his own bid for the White House two or three times over if he so wished? The answer has more to do about disillusionment with both major political parties, and the belief that an outspoken outsider like Trump could accomplish what even Barack Obama could not -- a radical change to the political process.""I didn’t donate to him because he needed money,"" Kinsey Craichy, who gave Trump's campaign $250, told The Huffington Post on Thursday. ""I donated to him because he’s not afraid to speak the truth.""Craichy, the CEO of Living Fuel, a nutritional company based in Florida, supported Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. This go-round, however, he's looking for a bolder nominee who isn't afraid to stand up for what he believes in.""I want righteousness,"" Craichy said. ""This guy has a history of getting things done.""Dennis Carreras, the CEO of Berstone Payment Systems in Florida, echoed the sentiment. He said that Trump's populist message resonated so much with him that he included a note along with his $250 donation.""Mr. Donald does not need my money, but I want to feel like I’m donating to a cause,"" Carreras said he wrote. Trump exploded onto the 2016 Republican presidential scene after announcing his campaign last month. Despite widespread media skepticism about a potential bid and controversy surrounding statements he made about undocumented immigrants, Trump has only risen in the polls. A national survey conducted this week even showed him in first place, to the delight of Democrats eager to associate his antics with GOP establishment candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.But his weaknesses as a candidate -- and his penchant for bomb-throwing -- doesn't hold back faithful donors. In fact, they admire him for his willingness to address illegal immigration and border security like no presidential candidate has before.""I don’t agree with everything Mr. Trump says, but what I do like is that he’s not beholden to anybody,"" Craichy said. ""He’s not perfect by any standards, but a lot of what he said was true.""""I’ve known a lot of Mexicans, they’re absolutely some of the hardest-working people I know. But it is true Mexico and other countries are allowing people that are terrible, with bad intentions toward other people, to come into our country illegally,"" he said.Carreras, an American of Cuban descent, similarly argued that the border needs to be addressed. He took issue with the way Trump's remarks about immigrants, in which he called some of them rapists and criminals, were reported. ""He’s speaking about illegal immigrants. Not all immigrants,"" Carreras said.Trump's candidacy presents several problems for Republican Party elites. He's likely to qualify for the first GOP primary debate in August, robbing a more plausible candidate of the chance to be heard before a national audience. Unlike traditional fringe candidates, he's wealthy enough to finance his own campaign past the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. And he seems to have hit a deep nerve with disaffected voters who are angry that neither political party seems to be looking out for them.For Carreras, a self-described libertarian who switched from the Republican Party and who also voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, Trump has brought something new to the table.""With Donald Trump, what I’m feeling is that he's bringing transparency.

It was her first public appearance since she announced her widely lauded transition to the world in an interview with Diane Sawyer earlier this year. She gave an impassioned speech, with a simple request for viewers and her fellow athletes -- show trans people your respect.Enter Peter Berg, director of the 2004 film ""Friday Night Lights"" and creator of the Emmy-winning series of the same name. Berg took to Instagram early Thursday to criticize the decision to select the athlete for the award, posting a photo mashup of Jenner with U.S. Army veteran Gregory D. Gadson, who lost both of his legs to a roadside bomb. ""One man traded 2 legs for the freedom of the other to trade 2 balls for 2 boobs,"" the caption reads. Berg's addition to the post consists of one word: ""Yup.""The Arthur Ashe award ""is meant to honor individuals whose contributions transcend sports through courageous action,"" ESPN said in a statement when it was forced to address criticism of its selection. ""We are proud to honor Caitlyn Jenner embracing her identity and doing so in a public way."" Award nominations are controversial -- some worthy nominees get snubbed and others overlooked. Individuals like Lauren Hill, the inspiring 19-year-old basketball player who died from brain cancer earlier this year, are equally deserving of praise and admiration.But the criticism surrounding Jenner's selection hasn't been based on her athletic prowess, her activism or her courage. It's based on deeply seeded transphobia perpetuated by those who focus on genitalia rather than gender identity -- people who ask invasive personal questions that fuel dangerous tabloid voyeurism.The world of sports is still a notoriously unaccepting place for many trans athletes. States like Virginia and North Carolina require students to play on teams based on the gender listed on their birth certificate, and no openly transgender competitor has ever participated in the Olympics, though they may be allowed to.Jenner's actions unequivocally transcend the nature of a sports landscape that's still struggling to accept gay athletes, let alone transgender ones. Her bravery compelled a room of many of the world's most celebrated athletes to give her a standing ovation.""Trans people deserve something vital. They deserve your respect,"" Jenner said at the event. ""And from that respect comes a more compassionate community, a more empathetic society and a better world for all of us.""The criticism may be inevitable now, but it won't be for much longer. A better world, Caitlyn's world, is right around the corner.Take note, Mr. Berg.UPDATE: 6:25 p.m. -- Berg espoused support for Jenner and ""trans people everywhere"" in a Thursday evening Instagram post. He wrote that he'd intended for his original post to shed light on ""our courageous returning war veterans, many of whom have sacrificed their bodies and mental health for our country.""You can watch Caitlyn Jenner's entire speech below."

Since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision legalized unlimited contributions from corporations, unions and individuals to so-called independent groups, candidates and parties have increasingly relied on groups like super PACs and dark money nonprofits to buttress their campaigns. This change has accelerated in 2016, as fundraising for almost every Republican candidate has been eclipsed by the super PACs meant to support them. Overall, candidates raised $122.4 million through June 30. The Republican reliance on super PACs is evident in lower fundraising for their campaigns than Democrats reported.The entire crowded Republican field has raised $57.6 million. The much smaller Democratic field appears more focused on raising money for their official campaigns than for outside groups. The combined total for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the top two in primary polls, tops the entire GOP field. Clinton and Sanders raised a combined $62.8 million.Much of this can be traced to the late entrance of candidates into the campaign. This year’s late start was largely due to the decision by some candidates, most prominently former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, to skirt campaign finance laws and directly involve themselves in the creation and funding of their own super PAC.Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who announced on July 13, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who will announce on July 21, did not disclose any fundraising numbers, as their official campaigns weren't established until after the June 30 deadline. Walker and Kasich both have been involved in raising money and hiring staff for unlimited money groups of their own. Bush, the leading GOP establishment choice and the son and brother of previous presidents, raised the most money of any Republican and his did it the fastest. He raked in $11 million since announcing his candidacy on June 15 -- approximately $733,000 per day. That looks like chump change, though, compared with the $100 million Right to Rise PAC, the super PAC Bush founded, will report at the end of the month.In his fundraising quest, Bush received help from eight Washington lobbyists who bundled $228,400 for his campaign. He also appears on the way to winning the Goldman Sachs crown, as employees and executives of the Wall Street bank gave $144,900, the most from people working for any single entity.Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) seemingly raised the most money during the period from April to June, with a $12 million total. But that was because $4 million of his haul came from his prior Senate fundraising. The first-term Florida senator actually raised $8.9 million since jumping in the race. Like nearly every other Republican contender, Rubio's totals are dwarfed by the $32 million collected by a super PAC and a nonprofit group backing his bid.Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) raised $10 million in the second fundraising quarter, but has received the most of any GOP candidate, with $14 million since March. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, as he was the first Republican to join the race. Cruz raised a large portion -- nearly 40 percent -- of his April-to-June haul from small donors who gave less than $200. He also has cultivated a donor base that makes many small contributions, to bump them above the $200 mark. Cruz’s impressive fundraising is likely to be trounced by a quartet of super PACs backing his campaign. The groups are expected to report a haul of $37 million raised from a stable of billionaires on July 31.Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson was also among the top Republican fundraisers, bringing in $8.4 million from April through June. His was the lone Republican campaign to raise a majority of funds from donors giving less than $200. Those small donors gave $5.7 million, or 67 percent of his total. Carson spent much of what he raised, with $5.4 million in expenses.Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) rounded out the top fundraisers of the Republican primary with $6.9 million, although $1.6 million came from a transfer from his Senate account. Paul, like his father, former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul, succeeded with small donors. He raised $3.2 million from donors giving less than $200, or 46 percent of his haul.Billionaire Donald Trump, who is leading the Republican race in national polls, announced that he had loaned his campaign $1.8 million. He also reported that some people actually made donations to his self-funding campaign, to the tune of $92,000. The former reality television star spent $1.4 million by the end of June.The other candidates reported lesser totals -- all sure to be outdone by their super PACs when they report at month’s end.Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) raised $3.7 million -- aided by a $1.5 million transfer from his Senate campaign; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee raised $2 million; former technology executive Carly Fiorina raised $1.7 million; former Texas Gov. Rick Perry raised $1.1 million; former Sen. Rick Santorum raised $607,000; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal raised $579,000; and former New York Gov. George Pataki pulled up the rear with $255,000.The sparsely populated Democratic primary field presents a far different dynamic, with Clinton and Sanders focused on raising money for their official campaigns. Clinton reported a total of $45.7 million raised and Sanders pulled in more than $15 million.Their fundraising strategies were quite different.Clinton traversed the country to hit up fundraisers hosting some of the biggest party donors, and raked in $31.1 million from contributors who gave the $2,700 primary campaign maximum or more for the general election. This fundraising sweep has allowed the campaign to spend a massive $18.7 million in its first months -- a total higher than what any other presidential candidate has raised for their official campaign so far. While raising $8.1 million from those giving less than $200, Clinton did not receive the kind of small donor love that helped fill Obama’s campaign account during both of his runs.Small donors, however, provided the bulk of Sanders’s fundraising haul. He raised more than $10 million from donors giving less than $200, thanks to a host of online grassroots giving through the liberal fundraising hub ActBlue. Sanders also shifted $1.5 million from his Senate account into his presidential campaign.The other two Democratic candidates in the race reported smaller sums. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley reported $2 million in contributions, and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee reported $393,000, with most coming from a loan from the candidate and just $30,000 in contributions.The big money will be reported at the end of the month, when super PACs file with the Federal Election Commission. Candidates counting on nonprofit groups to support their campaigns, like Rubio, Jindal and Bush, won’t have to worry about this disclosure, as nonprofits don't reveal their donors."

Holding a copy of the document detailing the deal that will dismantle much of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in return for sweeping sanctions relief, Pelosi praised President Barack Obama for his administration's role in negotiating the agreement.""I’ve closely examined this document and it will have my strong support,"" Pelosi told reporters on Thursday. ""This was the product of tough, bold, clear-eyed leadership on the part of President Obama,"" she continued. ""This agreement is precisely about intensifying our vigilance over every aspect of the Iranian nuclear program. We have no illusions about Iran.""The minority leader said she plans to voice her support in meetings with Democrats, as well as to answer any questions her members might have, noting that she has advised her caucus to carefully read the deal. Pelosi added that she is ""very optimistic"" about Democrats' ability to support the president when Congress votes on the agreement.Under legislation passed in May, Congress has two months to review the finished deal, after which lawmakers will have the option to vote on a resolution of approval or disapproval, or to do nothing. To reject the deal, two-thirds of members in both chambers will need to vote against it in order to override a presidential veto. Obama has vowed to veto any legislation that tries to stop the implementation of the international agreement with Iran. Pelosi wouldn't go so far as to say she thinks her caucus would be able to sustain a veto. She said members are in the ""education phase"" right now, but added that the responses she is getting from House Democrats are ""very positive.""""There is excitement about the fact that President Obama was able to keep P5+1, bring them to the table, and to sustain that engagement for a long period of time to produce an agreement is quite remarkable,"" Pelosi said.In contrast with Pelosi's optimism, a number of Republicans in both chambers have criticized the deal.House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) blasted the agreement on Thursday, saying it ""blows my mind.""Also on Thursday, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) announced that the first of many hearings on the agreement will take place on July 23. Secretary of State John Kerry, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will testify."

Lawmakers need to find $100 billion if they want to meet infrastructure needs for another six years, but Congress will likely delay, again, by passing a short-term fix.The Highway Trust Fund has been repeatedly patched up with short-term fixes ever since the last time it ran out of money in 2009. With a July 31 deadline looming, state officials aren’t hopeful Congress will find a long-term solution this year either. The result, they say, is an infrastructure system that has reached its “breaking point.”The biggest problem for the highway fund is that there isn’t enough money coming in to pay for all the infrastructure needs it must cover. The 18.4 cents-per-gallon gas tax that provides over 60 percent of its funding has not been increased since 1993, leaving a roughly $16 billion gap that must be filled by other sources. Despite a fast-approaching deadline and a major shortfall, there’s very little interest in Congress in raising the gas tax. In lieu of a federal solution, 16 states -- half of them Republican-led -- have elected to raise their own gas tax in order to repair crumbling infrastructure.For most states, however, raising their own gas tax won’t be enough to fill the gap. The majority of states receive more than half of their infrastructure funding from the federal government, and the federal government’s contribution isn’t rising quickly enough. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx issued a warning to states about the impending financial cliff earlier this week, saying the Federal Highway Administration would have to furlough workers.“Your agency will cease having access to personnel who assist with all highway projects, not just with processing payments, but also project approvals, environmental actions and permitting, authorizations for new projects and modifications to existing projects, technical assistance and other vital activities,” Foxx wrote to transportation officials in all 50 states. While the House passed a five-month extension for the trust fund on Wednesday, Senate Republicans don't plan on taking up that bill, instead chasing a longer extension -- even as the time on the legislative calendar winds down before August recess.Every time Washington fails to find money to pay for a long-term fix for the nation’s ailing highways, roads and bridges, states have to dig a little deeper, and the situation becomes more dire. One in nine bridges in the country are “structurally deficient,” meaning faulty or weak, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. Nearly half of the major highways are so congested that they cost the country roughly $101 billion in wasted time and fuel per year.The issue, said Carl Davis, research director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, is growing in importance every year that state and federal governments fail to update gas tax rates. “We are reaching a breaking point right now as evidenced by all the gas tax increases we’ve seen enacted in just a little over two years' time at the state level,” said Davis, who noted that at least two more states are moving toward an increase. That would bring the total to 18 state-level hikes.Bridges in the nation’s capital -- where members of Congress spend most of their time -- are crumbling faster than the national average. Seventy-seven percent of the bridges in Washington, or 185 of 239, are structurally questionable or functionally obsolete, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.Steel beams supporting the Arlington Memorial Bridge, which connects Washington with its northern Virginia suburbs, are corroding rapidly. A proposed Senate bill, marked up by the Environment and Public Works Committee, would provide a six-year fix for the highway fund, injecting $43 billion annually. But the bill as written doesn’t have a funding mechanism for the portion of those billions not coming from the gas tax, a decision that its authors are leaving to other committees. Prior to 2009, the federal government regularly paid $50 billion per year into the fund, about $34 billion of which came from the federal gas tax. With maintenance costs rising, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that Congress needs to find an additional $100 billion beyond gas tax revenues to fill the gap over the lifetime of a six-year bill. The latest Senate proposal would fill most of that gap if lawmakers can agree upon a revenue source. Members of Congress have floated ideas, but raising the gas tax is not one of them.Appetite for a federal gas tax increase is all but nonexistent in both parties."

In lieu of a federal solution, 16 states -- half of them Republican-led -- have elected to raise their own gas tax in order to repair crumbling infrastructure.For most states, however, raising their own gas tax won’t be enough to fill the gap. The majority of states receive more than half of their infrastructure funding from the federal government, and the federal government’s contribution isn’t rising quickly enough. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx issued a warning to states about the impending financial cliff earlier this week, saying the Federal Highway Administration would have to furlough workers.“Your agency will cease having access to personnel who assist with all highway projects, not just with processing payments, but also project approvals, environmental actions and permitting, authorizations for new projects and modifications to existing projects, technical assistance and other vital activities,” Foxx wrote to transportation officials in all 50 states. While the House passed a five-month extension for the trust fund on Wednesday, Senate Republicans don't plan on taking up that bill, instead chasing a longer extension -- even as the time on the legislative calendar winds down before August recess.Every time Washington fails to find money to pay for a long-term fix for the nation’s ailing highways, roads and bridges, states have to dig a little deeper, and the situation becomes more dire. One in nine bridges in the country are “structurally deficient,” meaning faulty or weak, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. Nearly half of the major highways are so congested that they cost the country roughly $101 billion in wasted time and fuel per year.The issue, said Carl Davis, research director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, is growing in importance every year that state and federal governments fail to update gas tax rates. “We are reaching a breaking point right now as evidenced by all the gas tax increases we’ve seen enacted in just a little over two years' time at the state level,” said Davis, who noted that at least two more states are moving toward an increase. That would bring the total to 18 state-level hikes.Bridges in the nation’s capital -- where members of Congress spend most of their time -- are crumbling faster than the national average. Seventy-seven percent of the bridges in Washington, or 185 of 239, are structurally questionable or functionally obsolete, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.Steel beams supporting the Arlington Memorial Bridge, which connects Washington with its northern Virginia suburbs, are corroding rapidly. A proposed Senate bill, marked up by the Environment and Public Works Committee, would provide a six-year fix for the highway fund, injecting $43 billion annually. But the bill as written doesn’t have a funding mechanism for the portion of those billions not coming from the gas tax, a decision that its authors are leaving to other committees. Prior to 2009, the federal government regularly paid $50 billion per year into the fund, about $34 billion of which came from the federal gas tax. With maintenance costs rising, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that Congress needs to find an additional $100 billion beyond gas tax revenues to fill the gap over the lifetime of a six-year bill. The latest Senate proposal would fill most of that gap if lawmakers can agree upon a revenue source. Members of Congress have floated ideas, but raising the gas tax is not one of them.Appetite for a federal gas tax increase is all but nonexistent in both parties."

Many of these people were bundlers for Clinton’s last presidential bid in 2008.Clinton is the first candidate in the crowded 2016 race to disclose bundlers. Two Republican candidates, Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, said they will disclose their bundlers in October. Republican Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), won't voluntarily disclose their bundlers.Clinton's list of bundlers was limited to those who had helped raise $100,000 or more. The campaign also reported on Wednesday that it had raised $47.5 million and spent $18.7 million since its launch on April 4. The minimum total amount raised by her bundlers was $15.9 million.Among the names are Esprit founder Susie Tompkins Buell; Comcast lobbyist David Cohen; hedge funders Blair Effron, Orin Kramer and Marc Lasry; Chicago billionaires J.B.Pritzker and M.K. Pritzker; Hollywood honcho and Israel booster Haim Saban; trial lawyer and medical marijuana proponent John Morgan; and The New Republic owner Chris Hughes and his husband Sean Eldridge. Lynn Forrest de Rothschild is back as a Clinton bundler in 2016. After Clinton's loss to Barack Obama in the 2008 primary, de Rothschild flipped her support to Republican presidential candidate John McCain. She backed former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman in the 2012 Republican primary, and Mitt Romney in the 2012 general election.A number of members of Congress, current and former, are among Clinton’s bundlers. They include Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), Jim Himes (D-Conn.) and former Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.).One notable bundler is Gordon Giffin, a former lobbyist for the Canadian company working to build the Keystone XL pipeline. Giffin is also on the board of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which paid Clinton $990,000 for speeches she gave immediately before announcing her presidential campaign.Clinton also disclosed, in a filing with the Federal Election Commission, a list of 40 registered lobbyists who had raised a combined $2 million for her campaign. The lobbyists included some, like Steve Elmendorf, who appeared on her list of $100,000-plus Hillblazers, and others, like former senator-turned-lobbyist Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), who did not.The top lobbyist bundlers were FTI Consulting's Jackson Dunn, with $231,554; Elmendorf, with $141,815; Capitol Counsel's David Jones, with $120,675; and McGuireWoods's Andrew Smith and Jim Hodges, with $133,350 and $106,750, respectively."

The 1,050-pound piano sized probe was launched January 19, 2006 aboard an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, (Photo by NASA/APL/SwRI via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a7b0a81200002b00135149.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"A fly-by snapshot of Pluto, the dwarf planet we’ve been singing songs about since grade school, literally shed light on a mysterious interstellar mass this week. At the height of New Horizon’s mission, gritty details of geographical features were captured up close.And, as if that weren’t enough to make a sci-fi geek giddy, NASA opened a public vote for exactly how to name Pluto’s peaks and valleys. In keeping with the tiny planet’s namesake, potential references for its features are being culled from underworld mythology. Of those suggested so far, there's Cthulhu, a character from H.P. Lovecraft, a blood-curdling octo-limbed dragon-person, and Balrog, that menacing dragon responsible for Gandalf’s near-demise in The Fellowship of the Ring. The themes for the names of features on Pluto’s many moons have mostly been decided, too -- nocturnal gods for Nix, river gods for Styx, fictional dogs for Kerberos. NASA’s OurPluto.org has more details about the voting scheme and submitted suggestions, many of which center on fictional villains and mythological, Hades-like gods.The names we’ve given to the ridges and black spots that make up the rest of the solar system come from other far-flung fictional worlds. NASA’s official page for sources of planetary names reveals Australian legends, Norse mythology, ""The Odyssey,"" Gulliver’s Travels, and many other classic tales as inspiration. Below, a brief guide to the galaxy’s literature-inspired features:MercuryMercury’s craters are many, so the category for its names is a broad one -- authors, visual artists and musicians who’ve died more than 50 years ago, and who’ve made a major contribution to their field. This isn’t restricted to science-fiction writers. Charles Dickens, Anton Chekhov, Ruyard Kipling and William Butler Yeats all have craters to their names. The most notable science-fiction writer with a crater on Mercury named after him is Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. VenusVenus, appropriately, has features all named after women -- mostly goddesses. Its ridges, or dorsa, are named after sky goddesses; its dips, or fossa, are named after war goddesses. Minerva Fossae takes its name from the Greek goddess of war; Arianrod Fossae is from the name of a Celtic warrior queen. MarsA few of the biggest craters on Mars take their names from writers who’ve penned stories centered on the planet. Isaac Asimov’s Martian crater was approved just a few years ago; Orson Welles’s was approved in 2003. The rest of the planet’s smaller craters are named after small towns across the world, including Wahoo, Nebraska, and Wallula, Washington. The features on Martian satellite Deimos are named after deceased authors Jonathan Swift and François-Marie Arouet Voltaire.JupiterNearly all of the features on Jupiter’s satellites -- Amalthea, Thebe, Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto -- are named after mythological characters related to each mass’ respective stories. Additionally, many of the features on Io are taken from Dante’s Inferno. A large swath of the the satellite is comprised of a region called Bulicame, a Dante-borrowed name coming from “the water of which sinful women were permitted to use,” according to NASA.SaturnThe moons and geographical elements of Saturn might be the most varied in terms of literary references. Because Saturn refers to the leader of the Titans, its orbiters come from Greek and Roman mythology as well. The satellite Mimas is named after the son of Gaia, and its features are all from Le Morte d’Arthur; the satellite Enceladus is named after a mythological giant, and its features are all from Arabian Nights.UranusYou might’ve learned that many of Uranus’s large satellites -- Puck, Miranda, Ariel, Titania and Oberon -- are culled from Shakespeare. All of the aforementioned but Miranda, Prospero’s daughter in “The Tempest,” are characters from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” The features on those moons are largely from Shakespeare, too -- Prospero, the conniving Shakespearean wizard, has his own crater, as does Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude. The craters on Puck -- the playful spell-caster from “Midsummer” -- are named after other mischievous spirits from Scottish, German and British folklore.NeptuneNeptune’s largest satellites have features that are mostly named after aquatic, Poseidon-adjacent gods and goddesses. The features on Triton are a little more creative, though. Many are named after fictional aquatic animals, like Akupara, the tortoise carrying the world on its shell from Indian folklore, and Bheki, a frog that also comes from Indian myth, serving as a symbol for the rising sun. There’s a chain of craters named after the Kraken, and a dark spot named after Namazu, the Ponyo-like Japanese fictional fish who causes hurricanes when he stirs. Also on HuffPost:"

The move comes as the international governing body of soccer is weaving its way through massive corruption investigations in the United States and Switzerland.The report follows the July 9 announcement that Teneo had purchased Blue Rubicon, a London-based strategic communications firm that for years has worked closely with Qatar’s effort to host the 2022 World Cup, which has been plagued by allegations of human rights abuses and corruption.Band, a close aide to Bill Clinton during his presidency and afterward, was the director of the United States’ 2022 World Cup bid that lost out to Qatar. He co-founded Teneo in 2011, shortly after he helped the former first family launch the Clinton Global Initiative, and he now serves as Teneo's president. Bill Clinton was once a paid adviser to the firm, but he stepped down in 2012. Band stepped away from his role at the Clinton Foundation in June, just before Hillary Clinton launched her 2016 presidential campaign, the New York Post reported.Teneo has close ties to other American lawmakers and officials. The firm lists as a senior adviser former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, who was appointed to an ambassadorial role by Bill Clinton and as Middle East envoy while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. Its team of executives and advisers includes former presidential advisers, top business officials and a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Huma Abedin, one of Hillary Clinton’s closest advisers, also worked for the firm at the same time as she was working for the State Department as an adviser to Clinton. Band co-founded the firm with major Clinton fundraiser Declan Kelly, who was a top State Department official under Clinton.The BBC reported that the ties to prominent lawmakers and aides were central to FIFA’s hiring of Teneo in the wake of a widespread corruption scandal that began with the arrest of seven top soccer officials in Zurich in late May. The U.S. Justice Department has indicted 14 officials on corruption charges, while the Swiss government continues to investigate corruption allegations around the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in Russia and Qatar, respectively. FIFA has maintained that it is cooperating with those investigations, and its president, Sepp Blatter, announced in June that he would step down to help kickstart broad reforms -- an effort Teneo, which lists corporate governance and responsibility and sports advisory among its areas of expertise, will likely assist.A FIFA spokeswoman told the BBC that it hired Teneo to ""to work across operational and reputational priorities."" Teneo declined a Huffington Post request for comment.Blue Rubicon, which according to the acquisition announcement will remain under separate management from Teneo, has an office in Doha, Qatar, and lists the Qatari Supreme Development and Legacy Committee, the arm of the government responsible for the World Cup, as a client on its web site. The site says the firm has at least two employees in Doha to work full-time with the committee.Qatar has been the subject of corruption allegations since FIFA awarded it the World Cup in 2010, and its labor system, which human rights and labor organizations have likened to “modern day slavery,” has also drawn international scrutiny. The International Trade Union Confederation, a global labor organization, estimated that as many as 4,000 workers -- most of them migrants from other countries -- could die on World Cup-related construction projects before the event begins. The Guardian reported that Nepalese migrant workers in Qatar died at a rate of one every two days in 2014.Though committees within the Qatari government have proposed labor reforms, international groups have said it has failed to implement them, and World Cup sponsors have begun to acknowledge the issue.Those reports underscored the “reputational damage” Qatar had suffered as part of the World Cup process and the reason it brought Blue Rubicon in to help, one Middle East-focused write-up of the relationship said. Blue Rubicon’s work is specifically aimed at the World Cup bid, while another firm handles the nation’s overall reputation, according to industry publications.Both FIFA and the Qatari Supreme Legacy and Development Committee have donated to the Clinton Foundation. FIFA gave between $50,00o and $100,000, according to the foundation’s documents, while the Qatari committee donated between $250,000 and $500,000."

It was such a success that researchers now plan to roll it out to 50,000 families in 16 states next year. The Clinton Global Initiative will help the researchers maintain dialogue with some school systems once the program is implemented.But that may just be the beginning.""We feel like this has opportunities around the world,” Susanna Loeb, a professor of education at Stanford who helped develop the program, told HuffPost.The reasoning behind using text messages is pretty simple. The overwhelming majority of adults in the United States have some sort of cell phone, and York says 80 percent of the parents who participated in the first phase of READY4K! had unlimited texting plans, even those in economically disadvantaged situations. ""Virtually all American adults have cell phones. Virtually all can get texts. And virtually all texts are read,"" Benjamin York, a doctoral student who worked with Loeb, said.Parents who enrolled received periodic text messages on their phones with basic activity suggestions for their children. For example, a message might have said: ""Tip: Say two words to your child that start with the same sound, like happy and healthy. Ask: can you hear the 'hhh' sound in happy and healthy?""""The evidence to us shows that text messages have some real advantages -- 140 characters are real easy to digest,"" Loeb told HuffPost. ""Everyone has access to it. It doesn't involve opening an app, or being somewhere where you watch a video.""While research shows that phone notifications can ruin an individual's focus, READY4K! messaged users only three times a week in its initial program. And the activities were phone-free for kids: The text messages might suggest a word-learning activity, but the child never had to touch the device.Plus, if you're going to be disrupted by a text message, it may as well be something that can improve someone's life.A study that looked at the pilot program -- released November 2014 in the National Bureau for Economic Research -- found that the text messages made parents more likely to participate in home literacy activities with their children. This increased engagement translated into learning gains for preschool-aged children in areas of early literacy.""We're blown away by the effectiveness of the program,"" York told HuffPost."
27,IMPACT,Here's The Actual Impact All Those Buckets Of Ice Had On ALS Research,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ice-bucket-challenge-als-research-impact_us_55a699a7e4b0c5f0322c0ae5,"Remember this time last year when everyone’s congresswoman, favorite singer and probably a distant cousin or 10 was dumping",2015-07-16,"Staffers douse Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and his wife, Crissy, with cold water on the steps of the state Capitol in Nashville, Tenn., Friday, Aug. 22, 2014. The Haslams were participating in the ice bucket challenge to support research into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. (AP Photo/Erik Schelzig)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remember this time last year when everyone’s congresswoman, favorite singer and probably a distant cousin or 10 was dumping ice water on their heads in the name of ALS research and awareness? The global #IceBucketChallenge raised an estimated $220 million in donations and, a year after it began, we’re learning more about the effect all that money has had.The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based ALS Therapy Development Institute, a nonprofit biotech focused entirely on ALS, is one group that received a sizable chunk of those funds. According to the institute, the $4 million it received from the campaign went directly toward research programs “with the best opportunities to make an impact to end ALS.”A quarter of the funds received from the challenge went directly to fund the first precision medicine program for ALS, a program aimed at identifying subtypes of the disease and determining the most effective specific therapies to treat each type in order to advance them into a clinical trial, according to the institute. And the rest funded the development of two clinical trial programs.Other groups working to address ALS, which is also referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease, have also spoken to the impact #IceBucketChallenge funds have had on their efforts. In San Francisco, biotech company Cytokinetics received $1.5 million to fund the late-stage testing of an experimental drug, called tirasemtiv, that could improve lung function for ALS patients. This marks the first time such a drug has reached late-stage trials, according to a Bloomberg report.As for the rest, the ALS Association has outlined how the millions of dollars in donations were doled out to other research programs, educational initiatives and patient and community services on its website. Among the other recipients of funds are the Neuro Collaborative, a partnership between three California laboratories working on developing new therapies for the disease.CNN reports the partnership, which received $5 million from the challenge, is working to create stem cell lines that will mimic ALS patients’ existing nerve cells. ""It's a bit like having an avatar of yourself in the petri dish,” Clive Svendsen of the Neuro Collaborative told CNN.There is currently no cure or known cause for ALS and only one drug approved by the FDA that has been shown to prolong ALS patients' lives by at least a few months, according to the ALS Association.The ALS Association plans to bring the challenge back next month -- and “every August until a cure,” Julie Frates, the wife of challenge co-founder Pete Frates, told CBS Boston affiliate WBZ last week.It will be difficult for the challenge to duplicate the success of its award-winning inaugural run, which marked a 1,000-percent spike in donations to the ALS Association.According to new research released Wednesday by Treato, an Israeli startup that tracks patients’ online discussions on health issues, only 14 percent of survey participants who donated as part of the challenge last year plan to donate again this year. Still, the challenge appears to have had a larger effect that perhaps goes beyond the fundraising.According to the Treato data analysis, online conversations about ALS grew almost six times compared to the same time the previous year, and 29 percent of survey participants who took part in the challenge said they had little to no knowledge of ALS prior to the campaign.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly described Riluzole, the FDA-approved ALS treatment, as reducing symptoms of the disease. The drug, instead, has been shown to prolong the life of ALS patients by at least a few months.Also on HuffPost:"

It's something that I've always been quite conscious of because racial tensions are very potent in the South. But the urge to take action really struck me after Katrina, when I saw all of these displaced, predominantly black bodies laid out in front of me.

What was your motivation to revisiting the visceral and disturbing image of Brown's dead body? Disturbing imagery has always been used in art-making to ignite meaningful conversation.

I have unfortunately upset many in revisiting this tragedy, but I think the conversations that are surfacing because of it are worth noting and may help us move into a new direction.Were you hesitant about the reception of the piece, particularly in the black community?I was very hesitant, indeed, because I didn’t want to dishonor the family, which is why I reached out to the parents.

By bringing this image to surface again I only intended to prompt and bring to light the very polarizing forces that continue to divide our country and that continue to isolate the black community.Do you think the coverage of your work thus far has failed to recognize certain aspects of the piece?Of course. What ignited this media sensation was a low-quality video of the installation that only focused on the replica of his body. There was little to no context for other very intentional and vital aspects to the work, including the audio of Eartha Kitt singing “Paint Me Black Angels” to commemorate this young man.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a6d1931300002b00939c3c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- With two weeks left before a critical deadline, the House on Wednesday passed legislation funding the nation’s highways, bridges, and roads for an additional five months. The Senate has other plans.In a 312-119 vote, the House passed a short-term extension to inject the Highway Trust Fund with $8 billion before it is set to go broke on July 31. Without the extra funds, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx warned, he will begin to slow federal transportation aid to states on Aug. 1.Congress cannot simply extend the Transportation Department’s authorization to pay states, but needs to infuse cash into the fund. The House bill scrapes together money from a variety of sources to cover the amount needed to keep the fund running until Dec. 18.""The House has now taken the first step to providing the stability and predictability that our highway program needs,” said Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) “This plan gives us our best opportunity to produce and pass a long-term bill to rebuild America’s roads, bridges, and other infrastructure this year.” Ryan, who authored the bill and chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, urged the Senate to “move quickly” to pass the five-month extension.“This bipartisan action will keep construction workers on the job, and pave the way for further efforts on a long-term infrastructure plan,” House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) added. But Senate Republicans are taking a different route, pressing forward on a long-term solution for the fund, with only 12 days remaining before the deadline.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) remained adamant on Tuesday that the upper chamber would bring a lengthier fix to the floor -- one that would supply the fund through next year’s election or beyond. After Wednesday’s House vote, that tune didn’t change. Don Stewart, McConnell’s spokesman, said leaders were working on a long-term solution. The Senate will have its first vote on a vehicle to move its highway bill on Thursday.It will take a lot of work for the Senate to reach final passage on a long-term bill though. Right now, there is no consensus among Republicans on how to pay for a six-year, let alone a one-year highway bill, because no one wants to raise the federal gas tax -- the primary source of revenue for the fund.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a66bf51200002c00134a08.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," WASHINGTON -- Running for president can be a humbling experience. And former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee is testing the depths of a candidate's psychological endurance. The one time Republican-turned-Independent-turned Democrat barely raised any money for his White House bid, reporting less than $30,000 on hand. And on Wednesday morning came a new poll from Monmouth University that shows him with zero percent. As in, there is no registered support for him.  Were this a one-time thing, perhaps Chafee could chalk it up to the variance of public polling. But, in fact, he's been hovering at 0.0 percent for some time now, according to the Huffpost Pollster averages. His campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.Chafee is contending with some of the same variables that have kept others in the field way down at the low rungs of public support. Eclipsed by the star power of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and unable to tap into the same type of grassroots support as Sen. Bernie Sanders, there really hasn't been much space to operate on the trail. Both former Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Sen. Jim Webb registered at 1 percent in the Monmouth poll. Chafee has the type of liberal record that would suit a Democrat well in a presidential year. But his odd campaigning style, his complete lack of money or infrastructure, and his virtually non-existent name recognition have left him, basically, alone. "
