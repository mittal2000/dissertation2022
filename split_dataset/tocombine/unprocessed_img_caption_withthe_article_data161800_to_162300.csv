0,SPORTS,How LeBron James Won Back His Fans,"Danny Groner, Contributor

He's paving his own way now. And, as a result, we're finally warming up to LeBron.",2013-03-03,"MIAMI, FL - FEBRUARY 26: LeBron James #6 of the Miami Heat looks on during a game at American Airlines Arena on February 26, 2013 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6d2c924000030009863c7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Is anyone having more fun these days than LeBron James?"" The New York Times asked on Sunday. It's hard to believe, but James has been the center of attention of late for good deeds and adding a little lighthearted entertainment to his routine. And fans have noticed, rewarding him with praise and laughter. It's come during a season when LeBron has put up numbers that are arguably welcome him into discussion for the greatest year any player has ever had. For James, that might not be a coincidence, and the great performances have helped him repair his image. But just how has he pulled off this metaphorical no-look pass?LeBron's drive to win has helped the Heat to an impressive win streak, but it's his happiness on and off the court that has earned him other accolades. Since the All-Star break just two weeks ago, everything that LeBron seems to touch turns to gold. For instance, his pregame warmup routine of showing off some spectacular dunks to fans has been graced with open arms from Heat fans and beyond. Joseph Goodman in the Miami Herald said:There's something unnatural about a 6-8, 270-pound man skyrocketing into the air and acrobatically throwing down dunks with brutish grace. It's like a comic-book superhero come to life. James pushes the boundaries of the natural world, physics and biology to where reality meets imagination.The old LeBron was talented enough to pull such a stunt off, yet not well-liked enough for these antics to work in his favor. Since the slam dunk contest during All-Star Weekend, there's been the annual debate over how to get stars like LeBron to compete. Magic Johnson is even now reportedly offering James $1 million to register for it. James' timing with these new versatile dunks couldn't have been better, keeping the focus on him and his abilities, while also giving fans what they want to see. It only whets their appetites more to see what LeBron will give away for free. What else might he be holding onto in his back pocket?Of course, it will take more than a couple of pretty dunks and big smiles to win over all of his critics. During the same period of time, LeBron caused a mini-controversy when he sported a Cleveland Browns hat in public. For Cleveland fans, the pain from the betrayal still stings. And when James appeared to come up limping during a game in Chicago, Bulls fans responded with applause. People don't want LeBron to get hurt as much as they are still working through their feelings about him.Now that LeBron has won his coveted and much-maligned title, Dave Hyde said in the Florida Sun-Sentinel, things have changed. Hyde wrote:We're used to champions led by snarling greats like Kevin Garnett or bat-throwing competitors like Roger Clemens. We embrace humbleness like in Aaron Rodgers or do-rights like in Peyton Manning. But a champion who has fun even in pre-game warm-ups? That seems to go against so many fans' DNA.And everyone has embraced it. Once the attention on LeBron's pursuit of a championship and questions of whether he was enough of a leader to pull it off had been removed, LeBron finally moved into position to just be himself. Free from all of the scrutiny and all of the haters. Sure, from time to time he'll rub people the wrong way; but that comes with the territory for NBA stars. Say the wrong thing once and it blows up in your face. What's different for James now, though, is that his narrative is being rebuilt. He's no longer just the guy who turned his back on the Cavs. He's a winner in Miami and he's rallied millions of troops behind him.Showing what he can do and enthralling fans at the same time is the true showing of a superstar. His star power transcends basketball, and he has been treating certain aspects of timeouts and stoppages in play as times to entertain fans as if he's playing for the Globetrotters. ""At twenty-eight, it seems, LeBron James is finally old enough to act like a kid,"" said Ian Crouch in The New Yorker.He's paving his own way now. And, as a result, we're finally warming up to LeBron."

(AP Photo/Koji Sasahara)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6d2cb3c000032000d67ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bud Selig has been a very controversial baseball commissioner. He oversaw steroid use for years, allowing it to become a major problem, before seeking, ineffectively, to address the problem for the last several years. He created the new three division system and the wild card -- now wild cards -- which have been a mixed bag for baseball. He also presided over a gratuitous offensive boom for about a decade beginning around 1994 which lead to a bloated and less enjoyable style of play.Selig, however, has done one thing extremely well. He has led MLB into a time when it is a more international game than ever before. Before Selig became commissioner there had only been a handful of Japanese players. Today there are many Japanese major leaguers, including some of the game's biggest stars, as well as players from Korea and Taiwan. In addition to the boom in Asian players, there are also more players from Latin America than ever before. In the next decade or so, there will likely be big leaguers from Brazil, China and possibly several European countries. This is great for the game, improving the quality of play on the field and making it more enjoyable for fans. One of the vehicles for making the game more international is the World Baseball Classic (WBC), which is just getting underway this week. This is an international tournament featuring teams from 16 different polities. The WBC is an unusual event. Some of the best players in the game will play this year, but others will be notably absent. It is likely, for example, that an All Star team of U.S. players who are not participating, such as Buster Posey and Justin Verlander, would beat the current U.S. team. On the other hand, some of the game's best and most exciting players like Robinson Cano, R.A. Dickey, Miguel Cabrera and Pablo Sandoval are playing, for their respective countries.In general, most of the teams combine players who are household names with players about whom most fans know very little. The Dominican Team will feature, Cano, Jose Reyes and Wandy Rodriguez as well as players who have much less experience in the big leagues. The Japanese team, which has won both WBC's to date, will not feature the most prominent Japanese players currently playing in the U.S., but rather will consist entirely of players from the Japanese league. For obvious political reasons, the Cuban team will have no players who have played in the big leagues.The tournament is imperfect because not all the best players are playing, and pitchers are limited both by pitch count rules and the fear of injury which keeps many of the best pitchers out. Moreover, the quality of play is erratic as there are some teams that are very strong like the U.S., Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Japan, and others like China, Brazil and Spain which will likely be drubbed, or at least decisively defeated, by most of the better teams.Because of all this, the WBC has generated some controversy. Some feel that without the best American players, the event is cheapened. Others believe that the scheduling is problematic. There is some truth to these arguments, but they should not overshadow the benefits of the tournament. First, the tournament generates excitement for baseball in many countries around the world. Countries like Israel, which just missed the WBC this year, or Georgia, whose baseball program is embryonic, can aspire to making it to future WBC's. This is particularly important as baseball is no longer in the Olympics.Second, the games themselves can be quite good with a very high quality of play, especially in the later rounds when the weaker teams are eliminated. In 2009, I remember staying up late to watch the Netherlands beat the Dominican Republic. I also remember the blank look on the faces of my two Dutch graduate students the next day when I congratulated them.The WBC also undermines the trope that baseball is some weird and uniquely American thing, like widespread obesity or not believing in evolution. Many Europeans would probably be surprised to know that there are relatively strong teams in Italy and the Netherlands, while the increasing popularity of the game in Brazil, China and elsewhere would also surprise many.The WBC is far from perfect, with occasionally uneven play and many of the game's best players deciding to concentrate on spring training rather than the tournament, but it is also a lot of fun for many people and an opportunity to highlight one of baseball's biggest accomplishments in recent years. Selig has gotten a lot of things wrong, but should be recognized for getting this one right."

They'd woken up to the words, ""I want a divorce.""The problem, they informed me, was that they did not.Talk about making an already soul-wrenching situation even worse. Here are some tips for coping with a divorce... that you don't want.1) Remind yourself that you're going to be okay. I know it feels like the air has been sucked out of the room, but it's still there. I promise. Keep ""I'm going to be okay"" as your mantra for this period.2) Talk out your feelings with a trusted friend and a therapist. Yes, I said both. Because you're going to need both. Finding out your husband of a zillion years doesn't want you anymore is like the world's biggest failed job interview.3) Do your best to remember that the ""why""s don't matter. In fact, they may make it worse. And I promise you this: they do not fix the situation or allow you closure.4) Do not ask your soon-to-be ex too much about why he or she is leaving in any vivid detail. An unruly imagination on top of your already broken heart is enough to deal with.5) Avoid stalking him. I know, you share bank accounts and possibly an email account, but don't make it your goal in life to find out what he's doing. You can't unlearn that sort of thing no matter how hard you try.6) Remember that you are not a failure. I don't know how low my self-esteem plummeted when the ""D"" word got brought up in my house, but I'll tell you that it was a very, VERY dark space and time for me.7) Know that there is a world outside of divorce, I swear. It's a different one, for sure, but it's a world in which you can make your own decisions. There are upsides to divorce.8) Don't freak out if your emotions range from frantic to rage to hysterical. This is normal. I had a ""crying hour"" from about 9-10 p.m. each night for months. This is okay.9) Don't bother trying to ""get him (or her) back."" No matter how many frilly undergarments you buy, it's over. I'm sorry. I really am.10) Above all else, remind yourself that you do NOT need to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you.

(AP Photo/David Graham)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdd6a2100003100c54bd1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I really had to pee. With only 25 laps left to go and a herd of drunk fans between me and the bathroom, I wasn't sure whether to risk it. After all, it was the Daytona 500.My dad's favorite driver, Jimmie Johnson, was making headway and looked like he had a shot of winning. It was my first NASCAR race and a bucket list item for both of us. And even though I'm Canadian, I didn't want to miss the end of the ""Great American Race.""You see, our Canadian citizenship extends only as far as our passports. Simply put, we love the United States. Whenever possible, we do our best to immerse ourselves in all things American. A scarring trip to a gun range, an underground drag race and rodeos have all been done.For the past five years, my snowbird dad who migrates to Florida every winter has become a NASCAR devotee. He idolizes No. 48, Jimmie Johnson, and told me that touching him at a past race was the most emotional experience of his life.Still, when a caution came out, which would effectively put the race on hold, I got up the confidence to book it to the bathroom before the checkered flag flew. I scurried down the grandstand stairs, passing the fans I had familiarized myself with since the race started four hours prior.There was a father who had been hand-feeding his young son, sitting a row below him, a monster hot dog. An older couple had come prepared with a cooler full of tiny frozen water bottles, sliced deli meats and sat on intense seat cushions with built-in cup holders and pockets. It seemed like everyone had brought some form of Wet Ones.And if the country music, excessive tattoos and copious amounts of Bud Lights weren't enough to scream America, the fans represented a rainbow of the nation's consumer culture. Corporate sponsorships, an integral part of the sport, covered everyone's attire. Screen printed T-shirts with logos for Lowe's, M&Ms, Cheerios and even Bass Pro Shops -- representing drivers past and present -- were the dress code and badges of honor for veteran fans.This brand loyalty extended outside Daytona International Speedway. The racetrack's neighbors included every major big box store and food franchise imaginable. These became the stadium's unofficial parking venues. Tailgaters drinking beer before breakfast and flatbed trucks blaring Van Halen's ""Jump"" were some of the scenes in our Best Buy parking lot where we paid $50 for a spot.There were times NASCAR culture and its eclectic crowd got the better of us. Over breakfast at the local Bob Evans we shared a table with a group from Pennsylvania who casually referred to President Obama as ""the black man."" Several sales clerks mistook me for my dad's barely legal girlfriend. At the Hooter's after party, a line dance turned ugly when a fight almost broke out, involving a man who painted himself green as a living tribute to Dale Earnhardt, Jr.We welcomed these outrageous moments as just another part of the NASCAR experience. Canadian or American, we were all here for the excitement of the race and the celebrations around it.So during my bathroom break I took a cue from the pit crews and did my business with speed. And when the final lap was called and we watched Jimmie's blue Chevy come around the fourth and final turn, we knew.He took the checkered flag, but we were the real winners."

""Keep your pants on at the playground"" and ""Tuna sandwiches don't belong in the DVD player"" come to mind.",2013-03-02,A young boy drawing pictures on the wall turns around to find his mom glaring at him,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce091240000300094dbb1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last night, my daughter, Angie, wanted to retrieve a giant inflatable dolphin from the top shelf of her bedroom closet. Because she's 6 years old and fiercely independent, she fashioned a chain out of plastic clothes hangers and decided to scale the side of her closet, like something out of an old MacGyver episode.Instead of reaching her dolphin, she came crashing down, in a flurry of broken plastic and tangled clothing.""Honey, don't use hangers to climb the wall,"" I said.And there it was: another sentence I never thought I would say. Over the past six years, I've uttered the most peculiar phrases -- things I never would've imagined myself saying before becoming a mother. ""Keep your pants on at the playground"" and ""Tuna sandwiches don't belong in the DVD player"" come to mind. When I was pregnant with Angie, I knew nothing about kids. I had never been a babysitter, had never so much as held an infant. My knowledge about babies would have fit neatly onto the head of a diaper pin.A month before my due date, I asked my 9-year-old niece, Maddy, to come over with her Cabbage Patch Kid and show me how to change a Pamper.""The picture always goes in front,"" she said as she squared the Big Bird cartoon between her doll's chubby legs. Maddy was kind enough to stifle her laughter. She probably never expected to be explaining something so obvious to a grownup.No matter how old we are, though, there are things we don't know until somebody who loves us comes along and spells it out. Maybe it's the words to a song sung incorrectly, or the proper way to tell if a pineapple is ripe. Or perhaps it's the notion that plastic hangers make lousy ladders.Here are a few of the sentences I never thought I'd have to say:""Don't put the alphabet up your nose.""We all want a little privacy in the bathroom, but leaving Angie alone on the toilet for too long spells ""D"" for disaster. Literally.I was cleaning my office one day, taking advantage of a few rare minutes of solitude, when I heard blood-curdling screams coming from the bathroom. ""Mama! Come quick!""I ran to my daughter, who had shoved a foam letter ""D"" up her right nostril, so far up that neither of us could retrieve it. I felt a surge of panic. Should I take her to the hospital? Reach for the tweezers? Call 911? Instead, I pinched off her left nostril and told her to blow with all her might. She did, and the foam letter shot across the room and landed on the floor. There was a lot of blood, more blood than I'd ever seen come out of my kid. Angie was shaken, but fine. She cried for a moment, then summed up the incident quite succinctly: ""Well, that was stupid!""""Don't lick the bottom of your shoe.""One Sunday afternoon, we were driving home from the zoo (of all the places in the world, why did it have to be the zoo?) when I looked into the rearview mirror and saw my daughter licking the sole of her pink Croc. ""Oh my God!"" I screamed, startling her so badly that she dropped the shoe onto the floor of the backseat. ""What are you doing?""""I don't know,"" she said. That's her answer for almost everything, probably because it buys her precious seconds to think of a good excuse or an acceptable lie. But this time, I figured she truly didn't know. I mean, what reason could a person possibly have for licking the bottom of a shoe? Closely related to this expression are ""Don't drink the bathwater"" and ""Don't bring your dessert to the toilet.""""Don't eat ketchup with a spoon.""I'm pretty liberal when it comes to how Angie eats her food. As long as she's actually eating it, anything goes. Well, almost anything. Mandarin oranges dipped in barbecue sauce? Sure. Potato chips in your ham sandwich? OK. Eating ketchup like it's soup? Sorry, but no way.""Wipe your hands on the napkin, not on the table.""Or on your shirt. Or on your friends. Also related: ""Don't wipe your nose on my arm"" and ""Don't pick Mommy's nose.""""Your butt is your responsibility.""I don't remember the context of this one, but I know I've said it -- more than once.""Spit that into my hand.""My mom used to say this to me about Hubba Bubba bubble gum, but for Angie, it's usually a new food she tried but disliked (calamari) or something that shouldn't have been in her mouth in the first place (a guitar pick or a quarter).There was a time when I couldn't debone a chicken without gagging, but since I've become a mother, nothing grosses me out. Chewed-up turkey sausage, green gobs of phlegm, wood chips from the playground -- it has all been spit into my hand at one point or another. Angie once vomited canned peaches. And I caught them mid-air, without giving it even a moment of thought.""Don't write on your honeydew.""Or the windows. Or the rug.When Angie was 4 years old, she took a blue Magic Marker to the beige carpet in her bedroom, and drew an elaborate design of circles and stick figures that stretched from one wall to the other.""I'm sorry, Mama,"" she said immediately. She knew she was in trouble. But when I returned to the scene of the crime with a bowl of soapy water and two sponges, her mood went from remorseful to resentful.""You're going to wash it off?"" she said. ""I drew a picture of us holding hands in a giant snow globe, and you want to erase that?""Artists are so melodramatic. After the carpet was cleaned, Angie lost her television privileges for three days. And I stocked up on paper and washable markers."

Drink Wisely. 3. Take Extra Safety Precautions. While there's nothing wrong with indulging a little while you're on vacation,2013-03-02,"Tropical celebration and beach party concept, perfect for spring break and tropical getaway projects.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce09c3c00005b0009ef1a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whether your idea of spring break  is a relaxing holiday in the sun or a week of day-drinking and bikini-clad college students, the 2,000-year-old vacation tradition poses its own unique set of travel challenges for college students and adults traveling to popular coastal destinations. Spring break stressors - which can include crowds, noise and safety concerns -- can be minimized by planning ahead and taking a few simple precautions. If you're heading to a popular spring break destination this year, scroll through the list below for tips to help you enjoy the most stress-free vacation possible. 1. Book Early. And we're not just talking about airfare. This rule applies to every aspect of your trip: If you're heading to a popular destination like Aruba, Cancun, Daytona Beach or Puerto Vallarta, it's going to be crowded. Be sure to book your hotel, transit meals and activities like surfing classes and boat trips early so guarantee your spot. Everything will fill up quickly, so make an itinerary before you leave and try to lock in your plans as much as possible to avoid setbacks. 2. Do Your Research. Certain cities and hotels will be overrun with college students during spring break, so choose your destination and lodgings wisely based on whether you're looking for a week-long party or not. Hard-core spring breakers heading to Florida would do well to check out Miami Beach, while Santibel Island is good choice for a more low-key, relaxing trip. The same goes for your hotel: If you're looking for peace and quiet, steer clear of beachfront mega-hotels. 3. Take Extra Safety Precautions. Unfortunately, countless spring break horror stories make headlines every year. Be sure to stay safe, particularly in destinations with higher rates of crime towards tourists. Following basic safety measures -- leaving valuables at home and refraining from wearing flashy clothing and jewelry, and making sure a family member or friend has a copy of your itinerary -- can go a long way in ensuring that you don't run into trouble.4. Pack Wisely. Sunscreen, flip flops and beach towels can easily cost twice as much as they usually would when you buy them at a tropical tourist destination. When it comes to spring, it's better to risk overpacking than to blow through your vacation budget buying overpriced toilettries and beachwear. 5. Drink Wisely. While there's nothing wrong with indulging a little while you're on vacation, be careful about how much -- and where -- you drink. Falling asleep on the each and waking up with a nasty burn because you've been daydrinking is an easy way to ruin to your week, especially since you'll be more prone to dehydration. Be careful about drinking in hot tubs, which can also heighten the effects of alcohol. 6. Get Off The Beaten Path. Even if you chose Cancun for your vacation so that you'd be in the middle of the action, take an afternoon or a day to get away from it all and unwind in nature by heading on a hike outside the city or boat tour of a neighboring area.

An online preschool is a great way to introduce children to the preschool learning activities they will be doing in the classroom, and how get them accustomed to being on the routine of a consistent daily schedule. Visiting the school and introducing your child to the teacher and classroom will help ease the fear of the unknown as well. Imparting information about the people involved can also be very helpful. Explain to your child that the teacher is there to answer any questions they may have or to help them with anything they may need. And giving information to the teacher about your child is just as important. For instance, if they have special words for things like going to the bathroom or their special stuffed animals, this would be very useful information to pass along; the more the teachers and school knows about your child, the more they will be able to comfort them.When your child begin attending school, discuss it with them when they come home. Ask questions like ""What was your art project today?"" or ""Who was the star of the week?"" Specific questions like these are better than open-ended questions like ""How was your day?"" in that you are less likely to get the same response every day. Being excited about and involved in your child's education will help them to become lifelong learners - and they'll find themselves even more excited to learn new things at school.   Here are a few additional tips:  1) Create teachable moments. These can be done anytime and anywhere. This can be as simple as counting the crackers they may be eating for a snack, asking them to identify the color of the clothes they are wearing or even pointing out letters that they recognize on street signs. The idea is to utilize your everyday environment to introduce math, language and basic skills.   2) Involve your child in social situations. Joining a parent-child class or playgroup is a great way to slowly introduce them into a peer-group setting. It may also benefit you by introducing you to other parents and families. And if this is not practical, for whatever reason, you could simply take your child to a local park or playground -- a great way to easily introduce and involve them with other children.3) ""Practice"" school. Enroll your child in an online preschool, read books about going to preschool, make an appointment to visit the preschool prior to starting. The more you reinforce this concept, the less scary it is likely to seem. Depending on the length of the program, you may also want to consider adjusting your child's eating and sleep schedule to coincide with the school's.  4) Allow your child to gain some independence. Some preschool programs may not allow sippy cups, bottles or pacifiers. Let your child practice using utensils to feed themselves and drink from a (shatterproof!) cup. Work with your child on simple, self-help skills, like getting dressed, putting on and taking off their own shoes, and practicing to take care of themselves in a bathroom situation (if your child is potty trained).  5) Half the battle is preparing yourself for your child's next steps. Speak positively about school. Let them know that, yes, although mom and dad will be leaving for a while, they will always come back. Explain the routine as well as you can in order to help give them some prediction on their day, i.e.: ""Mom and dad will come back and get you after lunch."" Utilizing some of the above tips can greatly assist in preparing your little ones for the first steps of their educational journey. And you'd be surprised how much they can help you as well. Time well spent, I'd say. Happy learning!"

Over dinner after the first day of their week-long ski trip he told her, actually, he didn't really like skiing, even though they'd been skiing together for years. Even though just a few hours earlier he'd been laughing and smiling and happily snowplowing his way down trails beside her. Even though he knew his mom, Andrea, had been excited to take him on this trip. ""I just don't like it,"" he said. ""It's not fun."" Fine, Andrea told him, if Joshua didn't like skiing, they wouldn't go ever again. ""And while we're at it,"" she added, ""why don't we cut out all vacations."" She was hoping, with her threat, to teach her son about consequences, and the need for gratitude and appreciation. She had no intention of abandoning family ski trips; she herself loved them too much. What's more, she suspected he did love skiing, but was just trying to provoke her. It had worked, of course. Most parents lie to their children, at various times and for various reasons. Maybe it's a lie about the existence of a big man in a red suit who makes and delivers presents, because doing so honors a tradition. Or one about the family cat being sent off to a farm where she can run free and chase squirrels all day, to avoid a difficult conversation. Maybe it's a lie about the real reason Mom and Dad are getting divorced, because kids don't need to know absolutely everything. Some lies are justifiable. Others are less so. Whatever the situation and justification, lying among parents is, it seems, the norm. A new study published in the International Journal of Psychology says 84 percent of parents lie to kids to get them to behave better. The most common: ""If you don't come with me now, I will leave you here by yourself,"" followed by false promises for a toy or other reward in exchange for compliance. Jane remembers the lies she was told as a child, which spanned from an alarmist fib about what happens to little girls who don't listen to their teachers to the real reason Daddy was in the hospital. Thirty years later, these are lies that stuck with her less for the information they withheld than for the betrayal she felt when she found out the truth. Her father had been all right, but it could've gone the other way, she knows now. And had it, her parents' lie would have robbed her of the opportunity to say goodbye. And yet now, as a mother of three, Jane's days are filled with lies. She lies about what happens to kids who don't brush their teeth. She lies about the real reason they were skipping a cousin's birthday party. She lies to her son about how good he is at the piano -- to encourage him, she tells herself -- and about what's for dinner, because the truth would surely elicit whines and complaints. She lies even as she constantly talks to her kids about the importance of total honesty at all times. ""I realize I'm a complete hypocrite,"" Jane told me. ""But some truths aren't age appropriate. And yes, sometimes -- most times -- it's just easier to lie."" In most cases, she reasoned (and dinner aside), they'd never know the difference. Wouldn't they? They may uncover the truth hours or days later, or it may take them years. They may, in fact, never know the difference. It might not matter: Each time a child needs to question whether or not a trusted adult is being honest, he feels a little less certain about that adult. Or he begins to doubt his own need to tell the truth. Lying can also prevent kids from learning certain rules, like in the case of a parent lying to a child about the consequences of misbehaving. What's really important isn't that they need to be quiet, or can't go down to the park by themselves, but why. What's more, truthfulness is crucial to a healthy parent-child relationship as much for the parent as for the child. Lying can help parents avoid, quite simply, parenting -- or, at the very least, difficult conversations. It can stand in the way of valuable bonding moments. For example: Teaching children about serious subjects like death, sex, relationships, and love are some of the most challenging, but also most fulfilling, aspects of parenting when approached with a child's age and maturity level in mind. Telling a four-year-old that her dog has died is a difficult, but appropriate, conversation. Telling her that her dog died after getting into a fight with a coyote can also be okay, so long as you make clear that she's not in any danger herself and perhaps use it as a chance to talk about the dynamics of animals in nature. Telling her that her dog died because you accidentally left the back door open, and that when you found him, he was torn to bits -- not information she needs to know. Acceptable lies: The ones that serve to protect children from information that would hurt them; the ones that help foster imagination and belief in an age-appropriate way, like in the case of Santa; or lies that that aren't exactly lies, but some small withholding of the truth, because you fear they don't yet have the capacity to deal with or understand the facts. Keep in mind, though, that kids can be surprisingly perceptive and often understand the basic themes of a situation -- hurt, sadness, happiness -- even as they may not understand some of the complexities. Jane's eight-year-old Ned, for example, could understand that his parents were having a disagreement, but Jane knew he didn't need to know about what. Talking about it later, however, became a nice teaching moment -- everyone has disagreements. A child doesn't need to know all the details, but if they suspect there's something you're not telling them, they may tell themselves that they're the problem. One way to know if your child is ready to hear the truth: Try him. Introduce the information slowly, gauge the reaction, and proceed or retreat as necessary. Be as honest as you can be while making sure he feels safe, and knows how a situation might relate to his own life, and how it may not. Kids only want to know what an event or circumstance means to them. Honesty isn't always the best policy, but it's a pretty good road to take. And just like lying, telling the truth gets easier over time."

For the hilarious inside story on one of the most insane, error-prone presidential campaigns in recent history, keep reading 'I'm with Mitt: Adventures in Amercia!' Coming soon to a bookstore or eBook reader near you, assuming someone out there possesses the gumption to publish it.Disclaimer: this blog will not be dictated by fact-checkers.II. Going InThe Romney campaign headquarters is located at 585 Commercial St. in the North End of Boston, a concrete three-story structure with all the aesthetic appeal of a used car dealership.The security guard buzzed me in and asked for my ID. I handed him my license and said I was interviewing for a job on the campaign. He told me to make sure I got a badge ASAP so I could get into the building whenever I needed to, so he wouldn't have to print out a sticker each time. I told him I would do my best to make that happen.Then my interviewers arrived and escorted me onto the elevator.Stepping off the elevator onto the second floor, a childhood memory suddenly flooded back: I was nine years old. My oldest friend, David Neumann, and I were hanging out at his tennis club in Lexington, Mass. My folks didn't belong to fancy sports clubs, so my first impulse was to jeopardize the status of his membership by suggesting we sneak into the women's locker room. First off, I was a tiny kid. So it was an easy thing to wrap myself up in a towel, walk past all the half-naked middle-aged tennis elite, position myself in a bathroom toilet stall, and close the door just enough that I could still peek out. For Neumann it was a different story. He was big not only by children's standards, but by any standards. As such, he was quickly rebuffed at the door: ""Wrong door, honey."" Neumann slunked off in defeat as I thanked the Universe for providing me so wealthy a buddy and so petite a frame. It was a glorious new day.The interview went very smoothly. The two women who interviewed me proved to be just as charming and bright in person as they had been on the phone. This, I reminded myself, is how they get you. They walked me through the halls to meet everyone and shake hands, and -- not so surprisingly -- everyone they introduced me to was extremely warm and friendly. And female. As in XX. So as upsetting as it might be for you to read this, you can pretty much disregard anything you ever heard about Romney not hiring women or being somehow opposed to hiring women. Because as it turns out, he does. A lot of them. Dare I say, binders-full.Along the way, we passed a campaign poster that read: ""CHANGE BEGINS WITH ROMNEY."" Odd, I thought, considering he's running against Mr. ""Change We Can Believe In"" and his whole focus is around getting America 'back on track.' Which is to say, back on track in terms of eliminating abortion, ending funding to Planned Parenthood, etc. But then I looked closer and realized it was a 2008 election poster. Of course, he lost the nomination to John McCain that year, who lost the election to Obama.My interviewers said they needed someone who could fulfill both Strategy and UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) roles, and that I fit those requirements perfectly. I walked them through my portfolio of work, which seemed to impress them, and along the way they revealed some fun facts about the campaign:  1. The entire Romney digital team is composed of 17 people. 2. All presidential-campaign staffs are extremely transparent, and the Romney for President (RFP) staff is no different. RFP employee names and salaries are publicly available on quarterly FCC reports. Thus, in order to keep certain employees off the RFP payroll, many contractors technically work for, and get paid through, Targeted Victory, their preferred and vetted vendor/digital partner. ""It's the complete opposite of how Bush ran his campaign,"" they said.  3. To speed the hiring process, I would most likely begin as a Targeted Victory employee while I underwent their thorough online vetting and background checks. After which I would, presumably, be let go. 4. The building was about to be torn down when Romney For President scooped it up for cheap, which explains the following:  • The cubicles have been there since the Reagan administration.  • The place is literally falling apart. Mildew colors the walls and carpets and the roof leaks when it rains.""We keep it classy at the Romney headquarters,"" my interviewers facetiously said. Two days later they called me back. ""Congratulations,"" they said, ""You got the job.""Tuesday - April 3 The nondescript gray horizontal surface I'm meant to use as a desk is situated in the middle of the second floor at a corner of a nondescript cubicle located just next to the media room, just across the hall from the big room where they hold the fundraiser meetings. Generally, a large number of Asians are in attendance at these (Chinese, not Indians). Take from this what you will. I only mention. Fundraisers have been going on all day, with scores of chatty, sharply-dressed folks coming and going every couple of hours. While I'm mostly concerned with how much free grub will be left-over at the conclusion of each meeting, nevertheless, when the meetings let out, I try my best to listen in. Here comes a nice snippet now. One tall, pant-suited woman just confidently declared, ""Obama thinks Massachusetts is safe Democratic territory, but it's not. Seventy percent of the state voted for Mitt!""Of course, she's forgetting one critical fact, which is that by the time Romney left Massachusetts, he had practically crippled the state, leaving everyone with a taste in their mouths akin to the one you awaken with the morning after a long night of binge drinking. If you'll recall, when Romney was governor, Massachusetts ranked 47th in job creation. People around here tend to remember things like that. Or maybe I'm the only one among us who remembers such things, since I am easily the oldest person working here. Across from me sits the son of the Political Director, referred to in the office as Little B_. He is sixteen years old, maybe. His job is to monitor social media, follow Twitter feeds and make note of any interesting activity. He has foolishly brought in an Etch-a-Sketch and displays it on his desk. Not surprisingly, he's already taken some heat for doing so.The air conditioning is unpredictable. Like Romney, it first subjects us to an arctic freon blast, then overcompensates, exhausting us with hot air. It's clearly not environmentally friendly. We all spend the day taking our coats on and off. I go from freezing to sweating and by mid-afternoon my sweat is freezing. I make a mental note to bring a sweatshirt and to dress in breathable fabrics. Layers will be my key to survival in this hostile environment.Wednesday - April 4 Romney won three states last night and yet the mood in the office is somber, perhaps because everyone is only just now realizing they might be stuck here until November.Or maybe that's just me.Thursday - April 5 One of the social vigilantes here is growing indignant. For the last couple of hours he's been tirelessly working to delete comments from a Satan worshipper who keeps spamming our YouTube videos with offensive comments. Now, it seems he's reached the end of his rope.""I bet Satan invented YouTube comments,"" he says, and means it. Little B_ chimes in, ""You can always tell how horrible our society is by looking at what's trending on Twitter.""Another staffer agrees, ""Freedom of speech is a hard line to draw but sometimes you have to draw it somewhere.""When it comes to ethnic jokes, the atmosphere here is a lot like it was back when I worked at the National Lampoon. Except back then we were being ironic or, at least, intentionally idiotic. Here, who knows? I just overheard someone say the following (out loud, even):""I like all kinds of women. I like black women, hispanic women. Angry black women. Sounds like a movie title: Angry Black Women. I like Halle Berry.""Granted, the average age of the Romney staffer is something like 23, fresh from the frat house.Friday - April 6 Today somebody sent us a uterus. As in, through the U.S. mail. I'm not sure to what species of critter the uterus belongs, but nevertheless, this impresses me. No matter how you slice it, consider how much planning goes into a thing like this. First, you got to find a uterus. That's hard enough. Even if it's just from your cat or whatever, you still have to get it out of the cat, which can't be easy. Maybe there's an online source for uteri? Anyway, then you've got to figure out where you're going to put the uterus in order to mail it to us. Presumably a jar is your most convenient option. Then you want to get some formaldehyde in there so the uterus doesn't rot on its way to Commercial Street. I don't know where you get that. Home Depot, maybe? Or maybe you just use a pickle jar and hope the juice does the job. I don't have much experience with uterine preservation, so you'll have to forgive me. Then you got to put the jar in a box, put some bubble wrap around it, stick a label on the outside, and head for the post office. Then, when you get to the post office and they ask you if the package contains anything liquid, fragile, perishable or potentially hazardous, you have to engage in the following conversation:""Yes.""""To which question?""""All of them. Well, maybe not the last one. I'm not so sure.""""Um. Okay, so...Liquid?""""Yes.""""Fragile?""""Yes.""""Perishable?""""Yes.""""Potentially hazardous?""""Um....""""Would you mind telling me what's in the box, please?""""A uterus.""""Excuse me?""""A cat uterus. In a glass jar. Filled with formaldehyde.""""Okay... and would you mind telling me why you're sending a uterus in a glass jar?""""It's a political statement.""""A political...""""It's going to Romney's headquarters in Boston. See there? Romney For President, 585 Commercial Street...""""Enough said. We'll send this right along...Next!!""Stay tuned for the next titillating installment of Steve Brykman's 'I'm with Mitt: Adventures in Amercia!' Coming soon!"

But her story is all too common for Syrian refugees her age. She talks stoically about her five-month odyssey fleeing Syria. Her family fled Homs nearly a year ago, as fighting engulfed the streets of that western Syrian city. They moved into a rented apartment in a village near the capital, Damascus. But when violence surged there, they had to pack up and move again, and this time, the family decided it was time to leave Syria altogether. Lana, her mother and an uncle were among nearly 60 Syrians attempting to cross a desert border into Jordan at two o'clock on a moonlit morning last fall. As they approached Jordan, the group came under fire from Syrian border guards. Lana managed to get across the border with others in the group, but her mother and uncle were pinned down behind a boulder for hours before they were able to safely enter Jordan. Every night, when darkness decreases the chances they'll be shot, an average of 5,000 refugees, half of them children, flee from Syria into Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. There are now more than 930,000 Syrian refugees registered or awaiting registration. While the refugees find save haven in these countries from the spiraling violence at home, myriad hardships continue. The rest of Lana's family trickled into Jordan in the ensuing months. She now lives in a three-room apartment with five siblings and her parents. She -- like 70 percent of other Syrian refugees -- has become what we in the humanitarian world call an ""urban refugee,"" meaning she doesn't live in a refugee camp. And she prefers it that way. ""Living outside is much better,"" she says. ""The food is bad in the camp, you have to share bathrooms and kitchens, and you can't come and go.""Unlike camp-based refugees, urban refugees must pay for their own housing, food, electricity and water. Many who can't afford rent and other services find shelter anywhere they can and struggle to get by. And while refugees in Jordan receive monthly $30 food vouchers from the United Nations and periodically receive donations of food from aid agencies, Lana says it's not enough. Many young people have been forced to work, some in dangerous or exploitative jobs that are largely under the table. Most don't have the legal right to work because host countries fear they will take jobs away from their own citizens. Lana says her cousin dropped out of 10 grade to earn money at a fruit stall, but stopped due to fear of arrest. Her father had been working in construction in Jordan, but he too had to quit last week because police are cracking down on the illegal employment of refugees. ""He used to be so calm,"" Lana says. ""Now he's nervous all the time and worries about his responsibilities as a father."" The family became even more concerned a week ago when they learned, during a phone call to relatives back in Homs, that armed men had seized Lana's 24-year-old brother. They still have no idea where he is or how he is.Countless young Syrians like Lana have witnessed unthinkable violence and live with tremendous fear and anxiety. They have no one to go to for support, and few parents and teachers know how to help them. One of Lana's coping mechanisms is to avoid thinking about home. In the early days she and her friends used to watch the news about Syria on television, but not any more. ""It makes us angry and frustrated to see what's happening there, so now we only watch entertainment shows, to escape,"" says Lana.Lana's main outlet is school. The Jordanian government, like other countries surrounding Syria, has opened its schools to refugee children. Lana says class work is fairly easy and her schoolmates are all refugees like her.But Lana is lucky. Many Syrian children have missed two years of school and wonder if they'll ever resume their education. Classroom space is severely limited in host countries, and many parents can't afford the required clothing and books. In some host countries, Syrian families are afraid or unable to register their children for school and they are concerned about language barriers and social tensions. What frustrates Lana most as a refugee? It's her awareness that some in Jordan are openly resentful that the refugees receive aid. ""I do understand why some poor people may envy us,"" she says. ""But for me, the word refugee is painful and sad. I would be happy to change places with them."" *Lana is not this teen's real name. It has been changed to ensure her privacy.

Penney Co Inc chief Ron Johnson knew before doing a deal with Martha Stewart that it would create a conflict with rival Macy's Inc, which already had a relationship with her.Johnson testified in New York state court on Friday in proceedings brought by Macy's against his company and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc over their proposed deal.The chief executive wrung his hands as a lawyer for Macy's grilled him over an email he wrote to a board member saying Martha Stewart would have to ""break"" her agreement with Macy's if he was going to ""pull off"" a deal with her.Macy's sued Martha Stewart Living and J.C. Penney after the they announced plans in December 2011 to launch Martha Stewart boutiques in about 700 J.C. Penney department stores. The boutiques are part of Johnson's strategy to re-invent the 102-year-old retailer, which released dismal holiday shopping season results on Thursday.Macy's claims that, by signing a deal with J.C. Penney, MSLO breached its contract to sell products in certain categories such as cookware, bedding and bath items, exclusively at Macy's.A non-jury trial is underway before Justice Jeffrey Oing in New York state court in Manhattan.Johnson testified he got the idea for putting Martha Stewart in J.C. Penney stores when he read in the spring of 2011 that her company had hired the Blackstone Group to evaluate opportunities. He believed Martha Stewart's influence on home goods was greater than the influence of any designer on the apparel industry.Theodore Grossman, representing Macy's, asked Johnson about an Aug. 14, 2011, email he sent to J.C. Penney board member Steven Roth, whose Vornado Realty is Penney's second-largest shareholder. Roth had said in an earlier email that Martha Stewart's exclusive deal with Macy's would be a ""major impediment.""""Martha could be the foundation of a reinvented home,"" Johnson wrote in the email.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reported this week that bank profits rose in 2012 to their highest levels since 2006, the year before the subprime mortgage meltdown gained momentum.Earlier this week, Bernanke delivered a strong defense of the Fed's unconventional monetary policies in testimony before Congress. He also warned lawmakers to avoid the looming short-term spending cuts known as the sequester."

It's the latest fallout from an embarrassing trading loss at the bank last year, one that eventually ballooned to $6 billion. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2ea5f220000ba01dbbb9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jamie Dimon now claims that he and his bank, JPMorgan Chase, labored to prevent the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, according to documents filed in federal court this week. That assertion directly contradicts the conventional understanding that the bank effectively exploited Lehman’s vulnerabilities for its own gain.“We took huge exposures to keep Lehman alive,” Dimon said during a Feb. 23 deposition conducted as part of a lawsuit filed against JPMorgan by the Lehman Brothers estate, which is seeking $8.6 billion in damages.Dimon’s characterization during the deposition stands in stark contrast to accounts of executives at other financial institutions, who assert that JPMorgan’s threats to cut off Lehman’s financing sent the bank into a death spiral.Lehman’s ultimate demise in September 2008 was a seminal event in what proved to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression; it turned tightness in credit markets into a global panic that set off years of high unemployment and hardship.A spokesperson for JPMorgan declined to comment on Dimon's deposition Friday and referred The Huffington Post to previous statements made by bank executives.The lawsuit filed by the Lehman estate claims JPMorgan took advantage of the investment bank’s precarious state to extract $8.6 billion from its coffers just a few days before it slid into bankruptcy. JPMorgan has denied such accusations.“JPMorgan did not cut and run but stood by our client,” Barry Zubrow, the bank’s chief risk officer, told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2010, adding that throughout the turmoil, JPMorgan “continued to make enormous -- discretionary -- extensions of credit to the ailing bank, and it continued to trade with Lehman.”But according to the final report from the commission, a congressionally mandated panel whose findings are considered the official history of the financial crisis, JPMorgan continually pushed against others who tried to prop up Lehman during September of 2008.On Sept. 11 of that year, Federal Reserve and Treasury officials spent most of the day trying to prevent a run on Lehman by convincing hedge funds and other banks to keep dealing with the investment bank. Dimon, the report found, was doing the exact opposite, calling executives at Lehman to demand $5 billion in payments he claimed were due immediately.When the Lehman executives told Dimon they did not have the cash, ""Dimon said Lehman’s difficulties in coming up with the money were not JPMorgan’s problem,"" the commission’s report states.""They just wanted the cash. We made the point that it's too much cash to mobilize. There was no give on that. Again, they said 'That's not our problem, we just want the cash,'"" Lehman's then-treasurer Paolo Tonucci told the commission in 2010.With Lehman struggling to raise the money that Thursday night, the report states unnamed officials at JPMorgan sent a midnight letter demanding Lehman post the collateral ""by the opening of business tomorrow in New York,"" threatening to ""decline to extend credit"" and force the bank into default if the payment was not made.Lehman eventually did pay $5 billion to JPMorgan, Lehman’s then-CEO Dick Fuld told the commission, based on the understanding that JPMorgan would keep lending the money back to Lehman on a day-to-day basis.Before Monday morning, Lehman had filed for bankruptcy.After the bankruptcy filing, JPMorgan did provide $87 billion in loans to Lehman in order to help the investment bank sell a key unit to British bank Barclays. In court filings, JPMorgan has said that in making those loans, ""which it was not obliged to do,"" the bank helped Lehman survive for a few days before it was devoured by creditors.""Had JPMorgan not done this, the overnight investors would have liquidated the securities pledged to them, Lehman Brothers would have been unable to sell its business, thousands of Lehman employees would have lost their jobs, and the seamless transfer of customer accounts to Barclays would not have occurred,"" JPMorgan said in a 2010 filing. JPMorgan also continued to provide vital services to Lehman following its bankruptcy.But in his deposition, Dimon appears to go beyond those earlier claims. He is now suggesting JPMorgan’s actions before the Lehman bankruptcy were also meant to help keep the investment bank alive.""We took a huge risk on the liquidation of all of that stuff. And I understand that,"" Dimon said, responding to a question from a lawyer that dealt with the Lehman-JPMorgan relationship prior to the bankruptcy. ""That does not mean you shouldn't ask for proper collateral. You're taking huge risk even after collateral."""

CEO with a winning combo of performance, panache and pregnancy, has really taken a tumble in the hearts and minds of the many who were rooting for her to succeed. With one simple dictat she's succeeded in turning the management cultural clock back to where no one wanted (or needed) it to go -- namely, to work! Must (not!) do number one at Yahoo! from now on: No home working allowed! It ushers back the days of office one-upmanship: he/she who does the longest hours in the office wins. Not only is this wholly unnecessary in today's tech-enabled working world, it also flies in the face of what managers and parents want. Our CMI Future Forecast 2013 survey shows that flexible working was way up there on the list of managers' policy must haves -- over 70 percent back it. Flexible working was also identified in our Women's Leadership Summit as one of the major enablers helping women -- and men -- navigate modern workplaces and combine these responsibilities with family.On a personal note, this reminds me of a time many years ago when, as a divorced mom torn between a policy that required me to travel to remote offices every Monday through Friday, and a young daughter whose Dad had just been diagnosed with cancer, I took the decision that working from home was the only option. When the company challenged my decision, I changed companies. I wonder how many of Marissa's rising stars will do the same. On an equally important note, a culture that embraces flexible styles is a culture much more likely to produce happy healthy employees that satisfy customers, innovate and produce meaningful results. Check out the CMI's 2013 winning Management Article of the Year -- where management practitioners vote on the best of academics' research. This year's choice, by Coventry University's Les Worrall and Lancaster University Management School's Cary Cooper, proves that collaborative, flexible, trusting cultures enable employee well-being, company growth, and far better results than autocratic, bureaucratic and suspicious cultures -- those, perhaps, that issue bans on working from home because they don't quite trust you to perform otherwise? Mayer's decision, ironically, is also a huge diss on her own product set. It's like she's saying what Yahoo! offers doesn't deliver when it comes to creating meaningful human exchanges. For that we apparently need to resort to offices cubicles and water cooler encounters. What? Big sigh. Like I said, on so many levels, Mayer's decision disappoints. But let's not hold her up as an example of women everywhere. She's not. She is but one woman manager, albeit an important one, who made, in my view, as a manager and a mom, a big mistake. It makes me mad. But let's move on: back to Moms and Management 2.0. On March 8, it's International Women's Day, a perfect time to reflect on how building better, more diverse cultures can help you achieve better results -- and build a happier word of work -- as a new CMI White Paper, out next week, will argue. So a big boo-hoo to Yahoo!. But a big ""hooray"" to the liberating cultures of trust, achievement and respect that enable us to be our best at work... and ya-boo to technologies that make it easier for us to implement these cultures to produce better results. Which is, by the way, exactly what Yahoo! needs most of all."

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb133d03c000020010bbe91.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Environmentalists are fuming over the conclusion from the State Department that the Keystone XL pipeline -- a fiercely-debated proposal to transport heavy crude from Alberta's oil sands deposits 1,700 miles to the U.S. Gulf Coast -- would be ""environmentally sound."" The government claims in the report released on Friday that the pipeline project wouldn't significantly alter climate change. Such an assessment is at odds with the warnings of experts and advocates -- more than 40,000 of whom recently convened in Washington to rally against Keystone. The report also is inconsistent with President Barack Obama's renewed pledge to tackle global warming, environmentalists said.James Hansen of the NASA Goddard Institute and Columbia University is among top climate scientists who have argued that approval of the pipeline would essentially mean ""game over"" for the climate.""To say that the tar sands have little climate impact is an absurdity,"" Hansen said in a statement on Friday evening that followed the late-day release of the State Department's draft environmental impact statement. The report, which focuses on the northern portion of the proposed pipeline, makes no recommendation about whether the project should be built, cheering the oil industry. The European Union's climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, told The Huffington Post in an interview on Thursday that she had been ""interested to see"" the impact assessment. She emphasized the importance of acknowledging that greater greenhouse gas emissions result from the extraction and burning of tar sands oil, compared with normal crude oils. A study published in January by the advocacy group Oil Change International bolstered this point. The pipeline project, it concluded, would have more profound effects on the climate than previously thought, due largely to the oft-overlooked emissions of petroleum coke, a refinery byproduct from tar sands oil. The State Department's new impact statement also suggested that Alberta's oil sands would be developed at pretty much the same rate with or without Keystone.Hansen refuted that claim as well.""The total carbon in tar sands exceeds that in all oil burned in human history, and if the pipeline is built, ways will be found to extract more and more of it, burning fossil fuels during the extraction and destroying the local environment,"" Hansen said.Stephen Kretzmann, executive director of Oil Change International, offered a similarly skeptical view. ""Please. If this were true, why would the Canadian government and the oil industry be hell-bent on building it? They know it's key to their expansion, and so do we,"" he said in a statement. ""The State Department is overlooking the fact that the pipeline is likely to trigger at least 450,000 barrels per day of additional tar sands production capacity.""The State Department's assumption doesn't necessarily agree with what industry itself has been saying in recent months. The climate advocacy group 350.org has posted quotes from the industry that the group said show that stopping Keystone would mean vast amounts of tar sand oil will stay in the ground,. ""All of the crude oil export pipelines are pretty much full, running at maximum capacity,"" Vern Yu of Enbridge Inc. told The Globe and Mail in November. ""And we're not likely to see any meaningful capacity added to these networks until the end of next year.""Obama in January 2012 rejected pipeline operator TransCanada's original route for the Keystone pipeline, citing environmental concerns. The State Department report considered TransCanada's revised route. Obama has said he'll decide whether to approve the pipeline this year.Not surprisingly, Friday's signal from Washington was met with support from pro-pipeline Republicans and industry groups.“Today’s report again makes clear there is no reason for this critical pipeline to be blocked one more day,” House Speaker John Boehner (D-Ohio) said in a statement. “After four years of needless delays, it is time for President Obama to stand up for middle-class jobs and energy security and approve the Keystone pipeline.”""It is time for our leaders to make a decision. ... Canada's did a long time ago,"" Daniel Kish, senior vice president of the industry-backed Institute for Energy Research, said in a statement. ""Too many are hurting and too much is at stake for any more time or money to be wasted on trivial matters and long addressed and re-addressed chimeras advanced by opponents of any and all affordable sources of energy.""Hedegaard was hesitant to offer specific recommendations for the Obama administration's domestic policy. ""How Americans will deal with Keystone is up to Americans,"" she said. But the climate commissioner warned of the danger in simply extracting ""all the fossil fuels that we can find in the world."" As HuffPost reported earlier on Friday, doing so would jeopardize any hope of keeping the increase in global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius -- a benchmark agreed to by world leaders as critical for avoiding the most dangerous effects on the climate system.Europeans were cautiously optimistic after Obama gave substantial attention to climate change in both his inaugural and State of the Union addresses, according to Hedegaard. A similar attitude has permeated U.S. environmentalists working to slow climate change. Friday's news may have quelled much of that optimism.""President Obama and John Kerry have eloquently pledged to respond urgently to climate change,"" Daniel Souweine, of the climate change advocacy group Forecast the Facts, said in a statement. If the State Department's determination becomes final, Souweine added, ""it would mean that these speeches were empty words that will do nothing to help the millions of Americans whose lives and livelihoods are already being destroyed."""

NASA, the agency that epitomized the ""Right Stuff,"" looks lost in space and doesn't have a clear sense of where it is going, an independent panel of science and engineering experts said in a stinging report Wednesday. (AP Photo/NASA, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb133cf2000009900ff9189.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you're the sort of person who woke up Friday morning worrying not just about the potential for sudden economic chaos following the sequester, but also the potential for human population growth and industrial activity to spur sudden ecosystem collapse on a planetary scale, take heart (and perhaps a Xanax). Some reassuring words are percolating on both fronts -- though as it concerns the planet's health in particular, the accuracy of those reassurances is in question. On the first point: the sequester's impacts on the wider economy, while almost certainly painful in the long-run, will likely be uneven and gradual. This being an environmental column, I'll leave a fuller dispensation of these ideas to my far more qualified colleagues in the Business section, and you'll also find meditations on the topic here, and here and here. As for Planet Earth, a paper published Thursday in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution suggests that while human society does a very thorough job of modifying and, often enough, permanently and abruptly changing the dynamics of local and regional ecosystems, the collective impact of all this on a planetary scale is too often overstated. Dire warnings that our localized impacts could trigger global-scale ""tipping points,"" after which the spinning cogs and gears that underpin our entire terrestrial biosphere are thrown abruptly and permanently out of whack, have no scientific basis, the authors argue. Global-scale changes, such that they are, come about smoothly and slowly, they say. ""This is good news because it says that we might avoid the doom-and-gloom scenario of abrupt, irreversible change,"" Professor Barry Brook, lead author of the paper and director of Climate Science at the University of Adelaide in Australia, said in a statement accompanying the study's release. ""A focus on planetary tipping points may both distract from the vast ecological transformations that have already occurred, and lead to unjustified fatalism about the catastrophic effects of tipping points.""""An emphasis on a point of no return is not particularly helpful for bringing about the conservation action we need,"" Brook added. ""We must continue to seek to reduce our impacts on the global ecology without undue attention on trying to avoid arbitrary thresholds.""This, of course, flies directly in the face of a growing body of research over the last several years -- much of it suggesting that there are very real planetary boundaries beyond which the entire terra machina starts to break down. This was the core of an extensive exploration published in the journal Nature in 2009.In an email message, James E. Hansen, who heads the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and is an adjunct professor at Columbia University's Earth Institute, said that tipping points may unfold more smoothly than people generally understand, but that they represent points of no return nonetheless. He also suggested that dismissing the notion of global tipping points out of hand was a mistake. ""Tipping points are real, albeit misunderstood by some people,"" he said. Last June, in another paper published in Nature, a team of ""biologists, ecologists, complex-systems theoreticians, geologists and paleontologists, from the United States, Canada, South America and Europe,"" according the University of California, Berkeley, which spearheaded the study, argued that ""population growth, widespread destruction of natural ecosystems, and climate change may be driving Earth toward an irreversible change in the biosphere, a planet-wide tipping point that would have destructive consequences absent adequate preparation and mitigation.""The authors of Thursday's study suggest this is nonsense. To prove their point, the team of Australian, American and British scientists looked at the impacts of four fundamental ecosystem influencers: Climate change; land-use changes (turning forest to agricultural land, for example, or native grasslands to pasture); the fragmentation of various habitats; and overall reductions in the richness and diversity of species. There is little doubt that humans have a hand in all of these, and there is also little doubt they contribute to fundamental and quite often permanent changes in the way local and regional ecosystems work. As a very simple example, think of the fast-growing and aggressive plant kudzu -- artificially introduced to the U.S. by way of Japan in the late 19th century and now, well, everywhere. Amid a fertile stand of trees and scrub and their dependent wildlife, kudzu can easily take over, strangling the local native vegetation, stripping resident critters of their accustomed food sources, and, at some juncture, causing the interdependent system that had grown up in that spot to collapse, with little practical ability to bounce back. Sure, a new system is in place, but the ""regime"" has been changed. The authors of Thursday's study, however, suggest that the local impacts of any stressor -- be it kudzu, or even rising temperatures due to human-driven global warming -- are vastly different in disparate parts of the globe. This heterogeneity of responses suggests that, on the whole, the planetary system would remain pretty stable -- or at the very least, global-scale changes will tend to be very gradual, rather than abrupt and catastrophic. Reached as he was boarding a plane Friday morning, Anthony Barnosky, a professor of integrative biology at Berkeley and the lead author last summer's tipping-point study, suggested politely that the new analysis, which he had reviewed, was missing a fundamental point.""Bottom line, they seem to not be taking into account that humans now connect all the ecosystems they are regarding as unconnected,"" said Barnosky, who argued that while local and regional ecosystems have always had, and still maintain, some variation in how they respond to similar environmental stressors, humans have come along and linked those ecosystems in novel ways.Erle C. Ellis, an associate professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and a co-author of Thursday's study, acknowledged those new connections. But in an email message he suggested that the impacts remain varied from place to place: Humans do move matter, energy and species across the planet, interconnecting ecosystems and populations like never before, and this does affect the biosphere. However, even when we move highly successful dominant species around -- like corn (maize) or kudzu (and other domesticates and other exotics), we find no evidence that this causes the entire biosphere to shift into a new state. Our effects on the biosphere are different everywhere (kudzu is not happy in the tundra, corn can't reproduce itself; we cut down trees in one region, they are regrowing in another, different areas respond differently to global climate change, acid rain, etc.) -- there is simply no evidence that these new global connectivities are causing a coherent or synergistic global response like a global tipping point.Even global climate change does not have uniform effects on the terrestrial biosphere, Ellis said, and ecosystems respond differently to the same changes in climate. He pointed to ""wetlands and deserts responding to increased rainfall, [or] tundra and forest responding to increased temperatures."" ""There is no solid evidence that the entire biosphere is subject to a coherent tipping point interaction with the climate system,"" Ellis said. Not everyone buys this. Michael E. Mann, the climatologist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, called the new paper ""thoroughly unconvincing and implausible."" ""We are not talking about random uncorrelated changes around the globe,"" Mann said, pointing by way of example to human-induced climate change. ""We are talking about dramatic, coherent changes in climate around the world, in the form of unprecedented rates of warming, increased continental drought, extreme flooding and wildfires. Moreover, these are not simply additive, but interactive, with a whole array of other stresses on ecosystems around the world due to urbanization and habitat destruction, deforestation and environmental pollution."" The totality of these stressors, Mann argued, is greater than the sum of its parts. ""It's part of why scientists are predicting a collapse of coral reef ecosystems around the world in a matter of decades -- the combined result of ocean acidification, global warming, coastal pollution, and other factors,"" he said. ""I suppose the authors would deny that this represents a global environmental tipping point.""His skepticism was echoed by Paul R. Ehrlich, a professor of population studies in the department of Biological Sciences at Stanford University and president of the school's Center for Conservation Biology. Ehrlich, perhaps best known for sounding the alarm on the consequences of human population growth in the 1960s, said that while many of the finer points of the recent tipping-point paper were well-taken, the assertion that humans aren't likely to cause bedrock changes in the planetary system may be shortsighted. ""The ecosystems of different continents are intimately interconnected by climate, fugitive dust, toxins, and human activities and health -- think epidemics, resource wars (possibly turning nuclear) and so forth, and thresholds are typical of all of them,"" Ehrlich said. ""I think one of the major failures of our communication with the public has been not to emphasize that in Earth's history, transitions have often been quite rapid.""If all this seems a bit academic, well, it is. But as both sides suggest, the debate bears significant implications for everyone, as the ledger of human impacts on the environment -- whether it's razing forests or killing off species or pumping planet-warming gases into the atmosphere -- continues to grow. Should there be a global tipping point out there, some line after which the whole planet breaks and loses the ability to sustain life as we know it, we'd surely not want to meet it. ""No one, of course, thinks it's a binary thing -- that you're fine one day and screwed the next,"" said environmental activist and climate action provacateur Bill McKibben. ""But the evidence suggests that if big things happen, they can trigger other big things: The temperature warms enough and then you get a lot of methane and carbon released from the far north, for instance.""  ""One always hopes,"" McKibben said, ""that the optimists will be proven right.""This post has been updated to add comment from James E. Hansen and additional comment from Erle C. Ellis."

Nearly 4 out of 5 Americans now think temperatures are rising and that global warming will be a serious problem for the United States if nothing is done about it, a new Associated Press-GfK poll finds. Belief and worry about climate change are inching up among Americans in general, but concern is growing faster among people who don't often trust scientists on the environment.

It hurts. A lot. I need more pain medication or different medication. I need it to stop hurting; a nine on the 1-10 scale of pain that patients are constantly asked to evaluate.Through 18 hospitalizations, cancer, a liver transplant, diabetes etc, I have learned that when an acute problem arises the relevant question -- the ONLY relevant question -- becomes, 'What do I have to do to get this {pain, bleeding, itching, fever, etc.} to stop?' In a hospital the answer to this question usually entails communicating clearly and forcefully to the person who has the expertise or authority to initiate the needed remedies; often a nurse or doctor. Sometimes the needed medication or procedure materializes quickly, other times more effort or more patience is required.Earth is running a fever courtesy of its human inhabitants. The fever is being measured and monitored. The prognosis is clear. The symptoms are increasing in frequency, severity and scope. If I (or, perhaps, if you) were the collective citizenry of this planet, I would ask myself the question: 'What do I have to do to get this fever to stop?' Then, I would communicate clearly and forcefully to those with the expertise or authority to initiate the needed remedies. If the remedies did not materialize quickly, I would communicate again, this time more forcefully and more clearly if need be. And again. And again, until whatever needed to be done was done. That is how it worked when I was in pain or bleeding or whatever -- I didn't take no for an answer. Ever.Well, we have a challenge on our hands, don't we? Until now, the call by a relatively small segment of the collective citizenry has, for the most part, not produced the required remedies. Carbon emissions rise, the Arctic ice vanishes, permafrost begins to thaw; the fever climbs unabated. With enough effort and persistence I could get the attention and action I needed from my hospital bed. Sometimes a healthier, more mobile family member would intercede on my behalf. But we --the collective citizenry -- are not one person. We are billions, we are fragmented, we are busy and stressed and, for the most part, many degrees separated from the corridors of power.Our millions of years of hominid evolution have led to this ""Challenge Point."" As a species, we have arrived at the peak of our adolescent development. We have explored the reach and scope of newly discovered powers and capabilities; often without regard to damages, limits and consequence. Now, some of our species understands that we must mature into authentic adulthood or, indeed, we shall perish in our adolescent stage -- and, by the way, take most of our planetary cohabitants with us.""Collectivize"" is a dirty word to many in our reckless, individuated, adolescent world. Of course, certain collective movements in our species' history have led to tremendous suffering. And so here is the challenge: Can ""we,"" lying in our hospital bed (for, of course, the Earth's ""fever"" is our own) call, and then, demand the needed remedies, clearly and forcefully and then even more clearly and forcefully if need be? Again. And again, until what is needed to be done is done?How many of the over 7 billion will be enough? 1 billion? Two? Three? Last week the ""biggest climate change rally in history"" drew about 40,000 of that 7 billion plus. The ""doctors and nurses"" are not yet listening. Some of them are too busy or distracted. Some are afraid. Some are actively muffling our cries for help. To become an adult species -- to exercise our considerable powers with consideration, compassion and wisdom -- we must collectivize. Can we do so while retaining respect and recognition for the basic individual rights and expressions of the citizenry that have been forged (and continue to be forged) along the way? This is our Challenge Point. There is no stepping back. There is no standing in place. We must move forward or perish."
