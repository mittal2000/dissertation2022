Today's Iraq syndrome could save us from a repeat of that debilitating war. In doing so, it might also compel policymakers to find a better way to combat terrorism.",2014-09-24,"In a March 29, 2011 photo provided by the U.S. Navy, the guided-missile destroyer USS Barry launches a Tomahawk cruise missile from their location in the Mediterraiean Sea to support U.S. military forces assisting the international response to the unrest in Libya. (AP Photo/U.S. Navy, MC3 Jonathan Sunderman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d6d2240000500098f63f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Secretary of State George Shultz once said that policy making on Central America in the 1980s was ""like walking through a swamp."" Today, the same kind of swamp is emerging around the effort by the United States to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). And, if history is any guide, this means that the fight against ISIS will not result in another U.S. ground war in the Middle East and may lead, in fact, to a better way to combat terrorism.The ""swamp"" Shultz referred to was the Vietnam syndrome, or the U.S. public's aversion to the use of military force in the developing world to shore up or overturn governments in the fight against communism. Shultz's boss, President Ronald Reagan, faced the ire of the Vietnam syndrome within weeks of taking office. Amidst growing public concern about a resurgent communist threat following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Reagan believed that his administration had the political space to ""take a stand"" in Central America. He badly miscalculated. A political firestorm erupted across the country when administration officials insinuated that the United States might use force in El Salvador. Public fears of ""Another Vietnam"" eclipsed all other policy debates at the time and nearly destroyed Reagan's legislative agenda to revive the struggling U.S. economy, his top policy priority. As the political ""swamp"" created by the Vietnam syndrome thickened, Reagan wisely chose to retreat. In the end, he sent only a handful of U.S. military advisors and increased military aid to El Salvador. The Vietnam syndrome ensured, in short, that U.S. combat troops never touched the ground in El Salvador or Nicaragua while Reagan was president. Reagan's story in Central America is not unique. Other U.S. presidents chose military restraint as well when facing similar syndrome pressures at home. George H.W. Bush chose not to ""go to Baghdad"" in the 1991 Gulf War because, as he admitted in his memoirs, he too feared political fall-out from the Vietnam syndrome. In prior eras, Calvin Coolidge abandoned a regime change intervention in Nicaragua in 1927 due to political pressure from a post-World War I public mindset against any kind of idealistic-looking military action abroad. And, Dwight Eisenhower chose not to place U.S. combat troops in South Vietnam due to the public mentality of ""No More Land Wars in Asia"" that resulted from public disenchantment with the Korean War. The same kind of political dynamics are at work today in shaping the U.S. response to ISIS. The American public is in the grips of a profound Iraq syndrome. The traumatizing experience of the 2003 Iraq War left a deep residue on the U.S. public and their representatives in Congress that shows up in today's political discourse as simple, yet oft-repeated phrases, like ""Not Another Iraq"" and ""No Boots on the Ground."" Recent polls show the same aversion to robust force. Despite the fact that seven in ten Americans view ISIS as possessing the capability to attack the U.S. homeland, a CNN/ORC poll found that only 38 percent support deploying U.S. ground troops to fight ISIS militants directly. The Iraq syndrome stands to blame for this reluctance to take robust action. ""Iraq is a constant ghost hanging over everything,"" a former State Department official said recently. That ghost, furthermore, is not simply a product of President Obama's cautious personality. Instead, it's an abiding feature of the current-day U.S. political landscape.   Like his predecessors, President Obama is bending policy accordingly. Stated simply, the President's plan for combating ISIS with air strikes and military advisers is nowhere close to the kind of military commitments made by the United States a decade ago in Iraq. These are limited military operations, intentionally crafted to avoid crossing the syndrome-dominated mood of the U.S. public. Even the comments made this week by the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, Martin Dempsey, need to be seen in this light. The embedding of U.S. special operations forces to advise Iraqi forces on the front lines and coordinate U.S. airstrikes is a long way from a redeployment of U.S. combat troops to fight ISIS. Efforts by the Pentagon and White House to clarify and back away from Dempsey's comments only reinforce the limited nature of U.S. military action against ISIS and show, again, the sensitivity of the administration to the Iraq syndrome. Outside of a cataclysmic event like a 9/11 attack, policymakers will not have the political space for the foreseeable future to deploy anywhere near the 50,000 to 200,000 combat troops that fought in Iraq during the last decade. The ""swamp"" of the Iraq syndrome is simply too thick for anything other than limited U.S. military engagement in the fight against ISIS.If history serves as any guide, that swamp is likely to only grow thicker as the national conversation about Iraq and Syria continues. The best way to avoid ""another Iraq"" is, in short, to keep talking about it. That is what happened in the 1980s with Central America. The endless political dialogue at home around ""No More Vietnams"" forced President Reagan to publicly repeat, time and again, his commitment not to use force in El Salvador. Eventually, that commitment became a self-fulfilling prophecy. The same is already happening with today's Iraq debate. As former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates correctly noted last week, every time President Obama says in public that the fight against ISIS will not be ""another Iraq,"" he boxes himself (and perhaps his successor) into making sure that that pledge comes true. In the end, this kind of boxing in may not be such a bad thing. We all know how the 2003 Iraq War turned out. Today's Iraq syndrome could save us from a repeat of that debilitating war. In doing so, it might also compel policymakers to find a better way to combat terrorism. The Reagan administration was forced to devise an alternative to direct military action in El Salvador. The alternative worked. El Salvador never fell to communism. Something similar could happen in the contemporary Middle East if President Obama's limited engagement policy works against ISIS. And if that happens, we will all have the ""swamp"" of the Iraq syndrome to thank for it."

Or have an accomplished Shakespearean actor with no flight training pilot the Boeing 747 you are taking across the Pacific? How about hiring a shark biologist to design and build your house? These suggestions are absurd because we all know that being qualified and competent in one area of expertise does not transfer to all others. But we seem to routinely forget this simple truth. That is why those who oppose climate change become authorities in meteorology and climatology, suddenly endowed with more expertise than a scientist who has devoted her life to the subjects. The deniers magically know more than thousands of qualified scientists from nearly 200 countries. This faux-expertise brings with it a deep irony as well. Many doubters cite the Earth's past cycles of glaciation and warming to discount what we are seeing today as nothing but natural variation. How do the skeptics know of that climate history? From the very scientists whose conclusions they now doubt! As if the scientists themselves are unaware of their own conclusions about the earth's past, or if they are aware, did not take that history into account. Deniers preferentially believe one set of facts from those scientists but dismiss other facts as liberal nonsense. I could not make this stuff up.False claim to expertise is why actors feel qualified as authorities on various matters unrelated to the film industry. Standing in front of a camera does not confer any special expertise on anything other than reading lines, but that stops few from venturing farther afield. The problem with claiming expertise outside one's true competency is that the ensuring claims are often ridiculous, misinformed, ignorant or downright dumb.The latest eruption of star-studded stupidity comes from comedian Rob Schneider (whose comedy I much enjoy). Schneider opposes mandatory vaccination, using the patently incorrect and absurd argument that ""the efficacy of these shots has not been proven."" He added, ""And the toxicity of these things -- we're having more and more side effects. We're having more and more autism.""I just want to scream in frustration. These claims from Schneider are not the benign utterances of an imbecile; they are deadly in their impact. Let us examine these two outrageously incorrect assertions. First, the issue of efficacy: Unlike the absurd claim made by Schneider, vaccines have proven beyond any and all doubt to be extraordinarily efficacious. Vaccines are the most important, effective, and safest medical advance in all of human history. Vaccinations have led to the eradication of smallpox and the near-eradication of polio. Any time you might have even a twinge of a thought against vaccinations, think of the millions of people who suffered terrible disability and death prior to the development of vaccines for these horrible diseases. And the millions of people now free from those scourges because of vaccines. Every year vaccines save 3 million lives among children younger than 5 years old every year by preventing diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and measles; if adults are included, vaccines save up to 6 million lives annually. If you oppose vaccinations, I believe you are for the death of an additional 3 million children every year. The Third Edition of the State of the World's Vaccines and Immunization reports that: ""Between 2000 and 2007, the number of children dying from measles dropped by 74% worldwide, from an estimated 750,000 to an estimated 197,000 children. In addition, immunization prevents sickness as well as lifelong disability, including measles-related deafness, blindness, and mental disability.""The study also states that: ""In 1988, polio was endemic in 125 countries and paralyzing an estimated 350,000 children every year (close to 1000 cases a day). By the end of 2007, polio had been eradicated in three of WHO's six regions - the Region of the Americas, the European Region, and the Western Pacific Region. Following implementation of the rubella elimination strategy in the Americas, the number of reported cases of rubella declined by 98% between 1998 and 2006. By 2000, 135 countries had eliminated neonatal tetanus and by 2004, annual deaths from neonatal tetanus had fallen to an estimated 128 000, down from 790,000 deaths in 1988.""If you oppose vaccinations, try to justify that position with the reality that in the absence of vaccinations polio would paralyze 10,000 children every year; German measles would cause birth defects and mental retardation in as many as 20,000 kids, and diphtheria would be a common cause of death in school children. Anytime you have an urge to oppose vaccination, think of your kid dying of diphtheria. If you oppose vaccinations, I believe you are for 10,000 kids each year becoming paralyzed.The deep, terrible irony of the anti-vaccination movement is that the incredible success of vaccines has caused the uninformed to forget how important, successful and safe vaccination programs are; and how vital vaccines are to preventing horrible diseases from reemerging. And reemerge they do: Because of the anti-vaccination movement, measles is once again rearing its ugly head. Measles is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among the non-vaccinated. There is no treatment for measles, only prevention. In 2000 measles was nearly eradicated in the United States; with a drop in immunization due to unjustified concerns about vaccines, the United States is witnessing this year the largest measles outbreak since 1996. Ignorance, false claims to expertise and scientific illiteracy are threatening our children's health.And now to Schneider's claim that vaccines are linked to autism. Again, I desperately want to scream in frustration at the top of my lungs. This bizarre claim comes from just one paper published in 1998 in the medical journal Lancet, subsequently withdrawn for suspicions of scientific fraud, and fully discredited by later study. Repeat after me: There is no evidence none, zero, absolutely nothing to link vaccinations with autism. It is a myth, a fallacy, factually incorrect. Yet tens of thousands of parents risk their children's health by withholding critical vaccinations. Like Schneider, many parents still to this day insist that vaccines cause autism, even in the complete absence of any evidence to support the claim with the withdrawal of the original paper. You might as well claim that vaccines cause baldness; no, no, I've got the perfect claim: Vaccines are ineffective but cause global warming! In that we combine belief in something for which there is no evidence and disbelief in another other for which there is indisputable proof. Perfect.Vaccines save lives, millions of lives, and prevent untold suffering and misery. Vaccines are safe and effective, as proven by billions of doses given with no harm. The efficacy of vaccines is beyond dispute with the eradication of some of humankind's greatest scourges and the precipitous drop in diseases once common. Of course absolutely nothing is 100 percent safe and effective; sitting on your couch with a helmet does not guarantee an airplane tail won't fall through your roof and kill you. But the awesome, amazing benefits of vaccines vastly, incredibly, outrageously outweigh any potential risk. Opposing vaccines is foolhardy, dangerous, irresponsible, and just plain ignorant. Please, please, please stop this misguided and misinformed effort to prevent vaccinations. If you want to oppose vaccines, go to an island with all others of your ilk and witness the devastation as preventable diseases ravage your population. But leave the rest of us sane people to the task of saving lives with the greatest medical advance ever seen in human history."

3,BUSINESS,Hospitals In States That Won't Expand Medicaid Left With More Unpaid Bills,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medicaid-expansion-hospitals_n_5876980.html,,2014-09-24,"FILE - In this April 10, 2013 file photo, White House Budget Director Sylvia Matthews Burwell testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington. The White House said Monday that the federal budget deficit for the current fiscal year will shrink to $759 billion. That's more than $200 billion less than the administration predicted just three months ago. The new figures reflect additional revenues generated by the improving economy and take into account automatic, across-the-board spending cuts that the White House had hoped to avert. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb313b53c000032000c4839.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"States that refuse to accept Obamacare's Medicaid expansion aren't just leaving behind poor residents, they're also hurting hospitals' bottom lines.Because the Affordable Care Act cut the number of people with no health insurance this year, hospitals across the country will see $5.7 billion less in unpaid bills, according to a report issued by the Department of Health and Human Services Wednesday.But the difference in states that have expanded Medicaid versus those that haven't is stark, the report shows. Hospitals in the 25 states that already have made Medicaid available to more poor residents and the District of Columbia will see $4.2 billion less in unpaid bills and charity care, a decrease of one-quarter. In the other states, the decline will be just $1.5 billion, or 9 percent. In other words, the reduction in the uninsured brought about by Obamacare has predictably led to a decrease in the number of people turning up at hospitals with no health insurance and no means to pay for their medical care. And that decrease is more substantial in states that allowed their poorest residents access to Medicaid coverage.""It's actually showing that this provides benefits to states,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said at a briefing with reporters prior to the report's release Wednesday. The findings are a reflection of the fact that the uninsured rate, especially among low-income people, has fallen much more in states that expanded Medicaid than in states that didn't.In a New England Journal of Medicine article published in July, HHS and the Harvard School of Public Health estimated 10.3 million fewer people are uninsured as a result of Obamacare. HHS also announced this month that 7.9 million more people are enrolled in Medicaid or a related benefit called the Children's Health Insurance Program than before Obamacare enrollment started last October. In addition, 7.3 million people have signed up for private health insurance via the law's exchange marketplaces, Burwell disclosed last week.The Democrats who wrote the Affordable Care Act intended to expand Medicaid nationwide to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level, or about $15,300 for a single person. But the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could opt out, enabling Republican governors and state legislators -- mostly in the South -- to refuse generous federal funding to cover low-income residents. Via: The Advisory Board CompanyThe failure to expand Medicaid in those states has left 4.8 million people who would have been eligible without coverage, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.The American Hospital Association, along with other national state hospital groups, endorsed the Affordable Care Act precisely because they wanted more people covered and fewer patients unable to pay for care. That's even though the law also cuts Medicare and Medicaid funding hospitals receive.In states that haven't expanded Medicaid, hospitals are enduring the funding reductions without the increase in insured patients, though. When the Supreme Court ruling came down, hospital groups in states like Texas and Florida unsuccessfully lobbied in favor of the Medicaid expansion. The figures released by HHS show why they tried. ""Many of the hospitals in these communities feel it already, but I think the data and information will help them make their case more strongly with regard to the importance to their bottom line,"" Burwell said.A growing number of states that initially didn't expand Medicaid are signing on, most recently Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, bringing the total up to 27 plus Washington, D.C. Burwell is in discussions with other states, including Utah, about bringing them aboard. ""The more that we are able to attract conservative Republican governors, the more that those who have very strong feelings will perhaps listen,"" she said.HHS based its analysis on financial reports from hospital chains such as HCA Holdings and LifePoint and on surveys by state-based hospital trade associations. The consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers published a similar report this month, and its findings are consistent with HHS's."

5,GREEN,U.S. Must Do Its Part to Support Green Climate Fund,"Peter Ogden and Gwynne Taraska, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-climate-fund_b_5878044.html,"Among the blizzard of announcements made as part of the UN Climate Summit over the past few days, one that should not be lost in the storm is the pledge made by French President Francois Hollande to contribute $1 billion to the new Green Climate Fund.",2014-09-24,"French President Francois Hollande speaks at the United Nations Climate Summit 2014 September 23, 2014 at the United Nations in New York. AFP PHOTO/Don Emmert (Photo credit should read DON EMMERT/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15ec2200000e500ff9fb7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Among the blizzard of announcements made as part of the UN Climate Summit over the past few days, one that should not be lost in the storm is the pledge made by French President Francois Hollande to contribute $1 billion to the new Green Climate Fund. This announcement -- along with smaller but still significant contributions from Korea, Mexico, Denmark, and Norway -- will have a direct impact on the prospects for reaching a new international climate agreement next year in Paris.Following on a $1 billion pledge from Germany, we at last see a pathway for the fund to meet its goal of a $10 billion initial capitalization -- if, that is, the United States and other key countries now follow suit. Only then can the fund get to work on its vital mission: to make strategic, paradigm-shifting investments that spur low-carbon growth and climate resilience in developing countries.The need for such immediate investment is clear. The International Energy Agency found that global investments in clean energy technologies and energy efficiency must double to nearly $790 billion per year by 2020 -- and increase to $2.3 trillion per year by 2035 -- in order to avoid dangerous levels of warming. In addition, the World Bank determined that the cost for developing countries to adapt to even moderate warming will be at least $70 billion to $100 billion per year through 2050, which is over three times thecurrent estimate of global adaptation investment.To help address this shortfall, world leaders agreed to establish a Green Climate Fund back in 2009 as part of the Copenhagen Accord. The five years since have been spent developing the fund so that it can play an effective role within the larger ecosystem of public and private climate finance vehicles.Getting the design right was critical and worth the wait -- but now that they have built the car, it needs gas to run. As the United States and others decide if and when they will follow the lead of Germany, France, and others with appropriately scaled contributions of their own, they should be encouraged by several features of the fund.First, the fund is specifically designed to bring about systemic change. While easier said than done, it is important that the fund is structured so that project proposals are not merely assessed on a case-by-case basis, but in the full context of a country's economic development trajectory. This means identifying and filling those critical incremental financing gaps that will then unlock much larger funding streams, thereby enabling transformational change. Even if it's a relatively small financial contribution to the overall project, such investment can be the difference between success and failure. The United States, for instance, has found that one important tool in helping to mobilize clean energy investment in Africa has been targeted assistance with early stage project planning -- once the plans are in place, the private investment (and ultimately the electricity) begins to flow. Second, the fund is jointly governed by developed and developing countries, and, if successful, can attract significant contributions from a bigger pool of countries than just traditional donors. Korea has stepped up to support and house the fund; Indonesia has already made a contribution and has indicated that it is prepared to increase its investment. China and others should be expected to follow suit. Not only will this help to ensure that the fund has the resources it needs, but it will give more countries a direct stake in its success and will encourage the participation of their private sectors as well. Third, one of the fund's main objectives is to elevate investment in climate adaptation, which historicallyhas trailed investment in emissions mitigation by a large margin. Adaptation measures, however, are increasingly necessary, as countries confront the effects of severe weather events and slow-onset events such as sea-level rise. The fund intends to support adaptation and mitigation activities equally over time.Fourth, a core part of the fund's mission is mobilizing private finance, and it has embedded in its design a private sector facility with the mandate to determine new and innovative ways of using financial tools and limited public money to drive the vast amount of private investment that is needed to meet the climate challenge. Countries have learned a lot during the past few years about how to better engage the private sector on the climate challenge. For instance, the US Overseas Private Investment Cooperation, which works with the private sector to meet critical development challenges, increased its support for clean energy from $8.9 million in 2008 to $1.2 billion in 2013, leveraging many times more that in private investment. The Green Climate Fund needs to have success like this at a global scale.The ultimate achievements of the Green Climate Fund will be known only over time, but countries -- both developed and emerging -- have it in their power to ensure that it gets off the ground. After five years, and with the impacts of climate challenge continuing to mount, the time to do that is now.Peter Ogden is a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress and former Director for International Climate Policy on the National Security Council.

6,POLITICS,E.O. 12333: End-Running the Fourth Amendment,"Peter Van Buren, ContributorAuthor of the forthcoming ""Hooper's War,"" ""Ghosts of Tom Joad:...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eo-12333-endrunning-the-f_b_5859048.html,"In Post-Constitutional America (2001-Present), the government has taken a bloody box cutter to the original copy of the Constitution and thrown the Fourth Amendment in the garbage.",2014-09-23,"President Barack Obama talks about National Security Agency (NSA)surveillance, Friday, Jan. 17, 2014, at the Justice Department in Washington.Seeking to calm a furor over U.S. surveillance, the president called for ending the government's control of phone data from -hundreds of millions of Americans and immediately ordered intelligence agencies to get a secretive court's permission before accessing the records. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d6af3c000032000df969.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Historians of the Constitutional Era of the United States (1789-2001, RIP) will recall the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, the one that used to protect Americans against unreasonable and unwarranted searches. The Supreme Court had generally held that searches required a warrant. That warrant could be issued only after law enforcement showed they had ""probable cause."" That in turn had been defined by the Court to require a high standard of proof, ""a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.""The basic idea for more or less over 200 years: unless the government has a good, legal reason to look into your business, it couldn't. As communications changed, the Fourth evolved to assert extend those same rights of privacy to phone calls, emails and texts, the same rules applying there as to physical searches.That was ThenIt was a good run. The Bill of Rights was designed to protect the people from their government. If the First Amendment's right to speak out publicly was the people's wall of security, then the Fourth Amendment's right to privacy was its buttress. It was once thought that the government should neither be able to stop citizens from speaking nor peer into their lives. Folks, as our president now refers to us, should not have to fear the knock on the door in either their homes or the homeland writ large.In Post-Constitutional America (2001-Present), the government has taken a bloody box cutter to the original copy of the Constitution and thrown the Fourth Amendment in the garbage. The NSA revelations of Edward Snowden are, in that sense, not just a shock to the conscience but to the concept of privacy itself: Our government spies on us. All of us. Without suspicion. Without warrants. Without probable cause. Without restraint.The government also invades our privacy in multiple other ways, all built around end-runs of the Fourth Amendment, clever wordplay, legal hacks and simple twisting of words. Thus you get illegally obtained information recycled into material usable in court via what is called parallel construction. You have the creation of ""Constitution Free"" zones at the U.S. border. The Department of Justice created a Post-Constitutional interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that allows it to access millions of records of Americans using only subpoenas, not search warrants, to grab folks' emails by searching one web server instead of millions of individual homes. Under a twist of an old ""privacy law,"" doctors disclose your medical records to the NSA without your permission or knowledge. SWAT raids by local police designed to break into African-American businesses on harassment expeditions are also now OK.The Center of It All: Executive Order 12333The most egregious example of such word-twisting and sleazy legal manipulations to morph illegal government spying under the Fourth Amendment into topsy-turvy quasi-legal spying is the use of Executive Order 12333, E.O. 12333, what the spooks call ""twelve triple three."" The Order dates from 1981, signed by Ronald Reagan to buff up what his predecessors limited in response to overzealous law enforcement activities. The Gipper would be mighty proud that his perhaps most lasting accomplishment was legalizing surveillance of every American citizen.Back to today. Despite all the secret FISA court decisions and as yet uncovered legal memos, most collection of U.S. domestic communications and data is done under E.O. 12333, section 2.3 paragraph C. Specifically, the one sentence that the government believes allows them to bypass the Fourth Amendment says the intelligence community can ""collect, retain, or disseminate information concerning United States persons"" if that information is ""obtained in the course of a lawful foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, international narcotics or international terrorism investigation.""So, the work-around for the Fourth Amendment is as follows: NSA collects massive amounts of data on foreigners, often by hoovering up every fragment of electronic stuff flowing around the U.S. it can. So, while purportedly looking for a single terrorist email enroute to Yemen (""the needle""), the NSA collects every single email from Google, Yahoo and Microsoft (""the haystack."") Thus, any American's emails caught in that net are considered to have been collected ""incidentally"" to the goal of finding that one terrorist email. The NSA claims that the Executive Order thus makes its mass-scale violations of the Fourth Amendment legal.Tom Drake, perhaps the best-known NSA whistleblower prior to Edward Snowden, put it in simpler terms: ""12333 is now being used as the legal justification for everything.""Oh and hey reformers: Executive Orders by one president stay in force until another president changes or negates them. We could have one at work today written by George Washington. What that also means is that Congress, should they regain consciousness, can't change an E.O. Congress could in theory pass a law making the contents of an E.O. invalid, but that presumes someone in Congress knows the order exists and what it says. Many E.O.'s are classified and if they are not, such as 12333, the legal documents behind them and FISA interpretations of them, likely are.Snowden KnewAgain, as a historical note, executive orders -- basically dictates from the president -- once did not trump the Constitution. However, in Post-Constitutional America, they do.As for this realization we have come upon, E.O. 12333, well, we're all behind the curve. Edward Snowden, while still at NSA, wrote a now-famous email to the spy agency's legal advisor, asking specifically whether an Executive Order has more legal force than an actual law passed by Congress, or indeed the Constitutional itself. The NSA's answer was a bit convoluted, but said in a pinch the Constitution wins (wink wink), even while acting as if the opposite is true.As General Michael Hayden, then head of the NSA, said in a blistering blast of Newspeak, ""I am convinced that we are lawful because what it is we're doing is reasonable.""Ask Obama This QuestionSo let's make it simple: Journalists with access to the president, ask this question directly: Why is E.O. 12333 being used today, interpreted by the FISA court or any other means, stating that the NSA's surveillance of U.S. citizens is ""reasonable,"" and thus no warrant is required for the surveillance to continue and remain constitutional under the Fourth Amendment?Of course, getting an answer out of Obama will not happen. After all, he is the Constitutional law professor who studied the document the same way a burglar learns about an alarm system. TO BREAK IT BETTER."

John Kerry's (D-MA) confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to become the next Secretary of State in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill January 24, 2013 in Washington, DC. Nominated by President Barack Obama to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, Kerry has served on this committee for 28 years and has been chairman for four of those years.

In a speech on Friday the 'other woman' of Democratic politics, Hillary Clinton, made reference to Warren's most recent book Fighting Chance:I want every one of our children to feel that they are inheriting the best of America ... that this country is on your side; that this country will give you the fighting chance, the fair shot you deserve.Just two days later, former President Bill Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that Warren is ""an important part"" of the future of the Democratic party.These two women, who are so publicly locked in a battle for the soul of the Democratic party will go head-to-head in New York City this week. For her part,Unfortunately for Clinton, she was set to kick off her CGI appearance the day after what many have billed as the largest march for climate change in history. This is problematic for the former Secretary of State because left-wing activists, those most likely to participate in the Democratic primaries, have long criticized Clinton for her failure to take a stronger stance on climate change.Warren, who has repeatedly said she won't take on Clinton in a run for presidency in 2016, was scheduled to be in town at the same time. On Monday, she appeared with EMILY's List president Stephanie Schriock to fundraise for pro-choice Democratic candidates. The juxtaposition of these two women battling it out in NYC this week is a fitting reminder of the struggle the Democratic party faces. While Clinton leads in the polls, has enormous establishment support and funding prowess, her reasons for running -- apart from the fact that she deserves it and has paid her dues -- remain unclear. So much so, she seems lately to be co-opting the message of her primary nemesis. Whereas Clinton's most recent 'I'm ready to run' book was unfortunately named Hard Choices -- hardly the message you want to send to idealistic, young, leftist primary goers. In contrast, the junior Senator from Massachusetts and her publishers chose Fighting Chance -- as in 'my focus is not backwards looking, a recitation of how hard I've had it, but on you and how I can help give you a shot at the middle class'. If nothing else, it reflects Warren's uncanny ability to stay on message.Clinton is smart enough to know when her book title has been beat -- and as a campaign slogan, it has. So it appears she recently decided to co-opt her main opponent's message. But the problem for Clinton is that she is so well-known, so ingrained in our conscience after all these decades that it is hard to turn the page. She may want to talk about giving us a 'fighting chance' and the 'fair shot' we deserve. But Truman-esque and Warren-esque don't work for Clinton because, for better or worse, we know her, specifically Democratic party goers know her, far too well.Clinton certainly has more experience, she is better prepared and equipped to serve -- but if history shows us anything it is this -- that is not enough to appeal to Democratic primary goers. They are rightly concerned about the future, they want to hear her apologize for the mistakes of the past (i.e. her support for the Iraq War, her cozy relationship with Wall St., her failure to address climate change, her hawkish stance on foreign policy, etc.) and provide a vision for the future (i.e. why is she running? what does she hope to achieve? is this more than just a victory lap for someone that everyone agrees is deserving of appreciation but perhaps not the presidency?).Until they get that, Clinton will be suspect on the Democratic left. Warren is untested, she is new, she is fresh, and so far, she is not running. But like President Obama in 2007-2008, she is on the right side of the issues as far as Democratic primary voters are concerned and that matters a lot more than the early polls may suggest."

On that night, I wonder whether the words of the Unetanneh Tokef, the troubling prayer at the heart of the Days of Awe, will resonate with news from the summit and the march preceding it about global efforts to rescue our planet. On Rosh Hashanah it is written, and on Yom Kippur it is sealed. How many will pass and how many will be created? Who will live and who will die? Who in their time, and who not their time? Who by fire and who by water? Who by sword and who by beast? Who by hunger and who by thirst? Who by earthquake and who by drowning? Who by strangling and who by stoning? Who will rest and who will wander? Who will be safe and who will be torn? Who will be calm and who will be tormented? Who will become poor and who will get rich? Who will be made humble and who will be raised up?For my fellow congregants, in the wake of a week of speechmaking about fossil fuels and greenhouse gases, when they come to ""drowning,"" will it mean floods and rising sea levels in their minds? Will ""thirst"" mean drought? Will ""wander"" mean climate refugees? Will ""not in their time"" mean the extinction we risk inflicting on posterity? Is that the sentence now being written and sealed?As I look around my congregation, as we speak the prayer in unison, I know that other thoughts, not about the planet, will also come to mind -- that ""strangling"" will call up images of unspeakable barbarity that have assaulted us; that ""stoning"" will put many in mind of the sanctioned evil being visited on women around the world; that ""poor"" and ""rich"" will remind us of rampant inequality; that ""earthquake,"" in at least some parts of the country, will pierce if only for a moment the veil of denial; that ""tormented,"" for some, will bring thoughts of Robin Williams. I also know that the ""but"" -- the hairpin turn this prayer makes after its inventory of life's unbearable, inevitable jeopardies -- will put many people off balance:But teshuvah and tefillah and tzedakah avert the severe decree.Every word of the Jewish liturgy is the tip of an iceberg of commentary. Teshuvah has inspired volumes about returning, repentance, reconciliation; tefillah, about prayer, gratitude, awe; tzedahkah, about generosity, righteousness, justice. No matter how those words are translated and interpreted, what they have in common in this prayer is that they trigger the ""but."" If we embrace them, they promise a stay of execution, a turn of fate, a better path than the one we're on. Will that work for climate change?""If the world keeps burning fossil fuels at the current rate,"" scientist Michael E. Mann wrote in Scientific American this year, ""it will cross a threshold into environmental ruin by 2036."" It's easy to imagine that when it's five minutes to environmental midnight, in the 2034 midterm elections, climate change will be the nation's number one voting issue. Unfortunately, it's also easy to imagine that by the time that happens, neither teshuvah nor tefillah nor tzedakah will be able to avert the severe decree of science. At a certain point, we will discover ourselves unable to outlaw or repent or pray away the carbon dioxide and methane blanketing the planet. If that time comes, no change of mind or heart or law will be able to derail our rendez-vous with catastrophe.Yet in the 2014 midterm elections, while there's still time to reset our course to resilience, climate change is not a top worry, does not promise to drive turnout, will not inspire a wave election.I hope I'm wrong about that. I hope that billionaire Tom Steyer has seen state-by-state numbers suggesting that NextGen Climate, his super PAC, can mobilize enough environmental voters to defeat Senate Republican candidates Scott Brown in New Hampshire, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Cory Gardner in Colorado and Terry Lynn Land in Michigan -- and potentially save the Senate majority from falling into the hands of science-deniers. I hope the money that NextGen puts into ads, field operations and get-out-the-vote efforts to beat Republican gubernatorial candidates Tom Corbett in Pennsylvania, Paul LePage in Maine and Rick Scott in Florida will rally citizens of those states to rescue them from environmental ruin. But the national polls I've seen tell a different story. In January, the Pew Research Center found that the priority the American public puts on dealing with global warming puts it 19th out of 20 issues tested. (Climate change ranked so low that in April, when Pew looked for the top issues in the midterms, they didn't even include it in the survey.) When Gallup polled Americans' level of worry about national problems in March, climate change came in 14th out of 15. A majority of the country said they worried a ""great deal"" about the economy, federal spending and healthcare, and 49 percent said unemployment, but only 24 percent said that about climate change, putting it behind hunger and homelessness, crime and violence, terrorist attacks in the U.S., drug use and illegal immigration. More than half of those surveyed -- a majority of Americans -- said they worried about climate change only ""a little"" or ""not at all."" I can understand why that is. Part of it is the limitless resources that the energy industry has been spending on propaganda, much of it laundered by phony think tanks and amplified by partisan media. Part of it is simply human: The scarier a thought is, the less we want to think it. The same facts that capture our attention make us despair and feel helpless. That's why UN summit planners have been saying they plan to spend scant time on the apocalypse and focus instead on innovation and opportunity. That's why hopeful children are the faces in 2036, the short video that the Norman Lear Center has made for climate week, and not images of planetary devastation. Is the prospect of solving problems and giving kids a better future a more powerful motivator than fear? ISIS is banking that terror will hold onto the world's attention like nothing else. It will be righteous of us to degrade and ultimately destroy their capacity for doing evil. When it comes to climate change, much better than repenting because the end is nigh is rejoicing because hope is at hand. This is a crosspost of my column in the Jewish Journal, where you can reach me if you'd like at martyk@jewishjournal.com.This post is part of a month-long series produced by The Huffington Post in conjunction with a variety of events being held in September recognizing the threats posed by climate change.

It is the myths of the latter that I have often written about in previous columns.In politics in the aftermath (or even in the midst) of elections, many myths are promulgated that take us further from the truth and darken a true view of reality. And these then have deleterious effects on decision making in the present because they are a misread of what actually happened.In 1992 and many years after, the myth was repeated that Ross Perot's independent candidacy cost President Bush his reelection. The truth was that Bill Clinton would have won by a bigger margin if Perot had not run at all when one looks at exit polls and second choice responses, as well as demographic breakdowns of his support.The 2004 election carried with it many myths, one big one being that President Bush won re-election because of gay marriage initiatives being placed on state ballots causing an increase in conservative voter turnout. The final results actually showed there was no difference in conservative turnout between target states that had gay marriage referendums and those states that didn't have them.In the last few elections I have also attempted to show that television advertising in presidential elections has very little if any impact on election results. And even though the media keeps reporting on the myth of the power of television ads (as well as this myth being pushed by consultants on both sides of the aisle), the state by state results show that advertising effects are minimal at best. I have addressed this one with much more detail in a previous column.Many of us have also bought into myths in our personal relationships. I like to call one of these the Jerry Maguire myth because it comes from the movie line of Tom Cruise's character who says to his love interest ""You complete me."" While seemingly romantic, it perpetuates the myth that somehow someone else will make us whole, or complete us in way that fills a void we carry and will make us happy. Having gone through marriage and divorce very young, and then remarriage and divorce again, I finally figured out some truth of successful relationships. It is that it is only when we fill the void in ourselves outside of another and that we no longer need a relationship for happiness, that we are then finally ready for a healthy relationship.And finally we arrive at a current myth related to the NFL and Roger Goodell. In the midst of the domestic abuse scandals, the myth has been repeated by nearly everyone that the owners won't fire Goodell because he has done an outstanding job and brought all NFL teams a tremendous increase in financial value. That Goodell has been such an outstanding executive as represented by growth in value that the owners won't do the right thing and fire him.As the ESPN site fivethirtyeight has pointed out, the truth is quite different and the only thing overvalued is Goodell himself. Under the previous NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, NFL franchises grew at an annual rate of 11.7 percent. Under Goodell since 2006, NFL franchises have grown at a comparatively paltry 3.5 percent. And when compared with other leagues, the growth of the NFL under Goodell is dead last with a total growth of 32 percent over his tenure. This compares at the same time to the NBA at 65 percent; MLB at 82 percent and the NHL at 114 percent. What it appears Goodell is good at is spinning positive press and a myth about himself to the media and to the owners themselves.If the owners really are business people at heart, and coldly look at the bottom line, and really care about and love the game and want to represent the best of America, showing Goodell the door would indicate they have broken through the myth to the truth. And when they figure out they no longer need the relationship with Goodell, they can then find the commissioner they really want and might help restore our trust and love of the game.As I have learned personally and in politics and in watching the NFL quagmire over the last few weeks about buying into myths, there is much truth in this quote from The Brothers Karamazov: ""Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.""There you have it."

As of 2011, that figure stood at 13 deaths per 100,000, the Center for Rural Pennsylvania said in the report.""Heroin is cheaper and easier for young people to obtain than alcohol,"" said State Senator Gene Yaw, the Republican chairman of the center, a joint legislative state agency.Pennsylvania is not alone in its heroin problem. In rural Vermont, Governor Peter Shumlin said his state was experiencing a ""full-blown heroin crisis,"" while the overdose rate in New York City has surged as well, especially in the wealthiest neighborhoods.In Pennsylvania, Yaw said a small packet of heroin costs between $5 and $10 and delivers a high lasting four to five hours.The report, based on evidence submitted in hearings across the state this summer, listed Cambria County in central Pennsylvania as having the highest overdose death rate outside of Philadelphia, 22.6 deaths per 100,000 population. That is equal to Philadelphia's drug death rate, the report said.Yaw suggested Cambria County's drug death rate was not caused by any special factors, but state Representative Bryan Barbin, a Democrat, was not so sure.Barbin said Johnstown is easily accessible from heroin distribution centers like Baltimore. Dealing heroin is an attractive career option for those with few economic prospects, he said, especially those with drug crime records.The report called for a number of legislative actions, including making it easier to prosecute dealers whose customers die of overdoses, and a ""Good Samaritan"" law assuring that people who seek help for overdose victims will not face criminal charges.Putting more addicts in jail will not solve the problem, the report said.State Representative Richard Marabito, a Democrat, said Pennsylvania has about 760,000 residents with addiction problems, but that only about 52,000 are receiving treatment. Only one in eight addicts can be helped with existing state resources, the report said. (Writing By Frank McGurty)"

Kerry and regional counterparts began talks today in Saudi Arabia on forming a coalition to support an American campaign against Islamic State jihadists in Syria and Iraq. AFP PHOTO/POOL/BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13dc8240000330076e9d5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- As the U.S. launched the first airstrikes against the Islamic State and other militants inside Syria, it drew on support from five Arab nations: Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. President Barack Obama views Arab involvement as key, administration officials have said. He reportedly waited for diplomatic alliance-building efforts to bear fruit before approving the Monday night strikes.The Arab allies are playing a visible role at the beginning of what the administration has said will be a years-long campaign against the Islamic State. Maintaining that multilateral support will be a priority for the U.S., experts say. Arab investment in the campaign is critical for reasons ranging from the difficult optics of American involvement in the Middle East to the hope that regional leadership -- particularly by Sunni nations -- will help rally local opposition against the insurgent group also known as ISIS or ISIL.""The Obama administration wants to do everything possible to make this campaign against ISIS look different than the George W. Bush campaign against Saddam Hussein,"" said Max Abrahms, a Northeastern University professor who studies counterterrorism. ""Obama hopes to do this in two ways. The first is multilateralism, and the second is no U.S. boots on the ground.""""We don’t want to be seen as occupiers,"" Abrahms added.The question now is how the Arab allies see the campaign -- and how much Washington can rely on them for continued support. Washington has already been disappointed by one other country it often works with on Middle East issues: NATO member Turkey has yet to overtly join the effort against the Islamic State.The leaders of the five Arab ally states share some aims. For the Gulf states in the coalition -- all except Jordan -- this moment is an opportunity to bolster their reputations as leaders in the region and good allies internationally, said Randa Slim, a scholar at the Middle East Institute. Abrahms said all five of the current partners would also benefit if they could use the campaign to show their domestic constituencies that they are undermining the rule of Bashar Assad. The Syrian president's massacres of his own people have made him unpopular across the region, particularly among the Sunnis who hold majorities in all but one of the allied countries and who are wary of Assad's sectarian connections. He belongs to the Alawite sect of Shiite Islam and has been backed by the main Shiite power in the region, Iran.Beyond these goals, experts and news reports suggest, each country has its own motives for participating in the U.S.-led fight.Saudi Arabia: While Riyadh's rulers have long been willing to cooperate in Middle East operations that matter to the U.S., they take the fight against the Islamic State personally: The group is widely seen as seeking to replace the reigning Saud family with leaders more committed to extreme Wahhabi ideology. The stronger the group becomes, the more capable it is of launching an effort to take over the holy Muslim sites of Mecca and Medina.The Saudi rulers' control of the historic mosques in those two cities confers a special kind of authority on them in the Muslim world. It has been a chief target of anti-Saudi ISIS propaganda, which vows ""to liberate the 'Land of the Two Holy Mosques' once their mission in Syria has been accomplished,"" according to Fahad Nazer, a former political analyst at the Saudi Embassy in Washington.The fact that Riyadh seems prepared to temporarily align with its traditional regional rival, Iran, in this fight offers some proof that the Saudis feel especially threatened.Beyond stemming a current threat, the Saudis may also be thinking about their long-term influence, Slim said. She noted that by hosting camps for non-jihadist Syrian fighters whose training the U.S. is paying for, the Saudi government can develop relationships with groups that may eventually rule Syria. That would give the Saudis an ally in an important regional capital now friendly to the Iranians.Jordan: Like Saudi Arabia, Jordan considers itself a prime target for Islamic State ambitions. It is internally weak, given its faltering economy, ongoing domestic dissent and a continued influx of refugees from the Syrian civil war. And earlier this year, the Islamic State publicly threatened the U.S.-friendly Jordanian king. For this fragile nation, a more stable neighborhood would be a blessing. With its military and intelligence capabilities, Slim said, Jordan is also well-equipped to help undermine the Islamic State.Bahrain: Since major protests in Bahrain during the Arab Spring a few years back, the leadership there has relied heavily on Saudi assistance -- in practical terms, to tackle the protesters from the Shiite majority who hoped to topple the Sunni monarchy, and strategically, to balance the influence of the regional Shiite power, Iran. Bahrain's motives for participating in the anti-Islamic State campaign are primarily to prove its commitment to both its Saudi backers and the West, Slim said.The focus on public relations benefits goes both ways, she added. ""What does Bahrain bring? I don’t think it brings so much except another name"" to add to the list of U.S. regional partners, said Slim.Qatar: This tiny state's role is perhaps the most complex. Because it has a relationship to maintain with the U.S. -- the country hosts the largest American military base in the region -- Qatar's name on the list of Arab partners helping with the Syria strikes was not a surprise.But The New York Times reported earlier this month that the wealthy country is viewed by at least two other partners in the anti-Islamic State coalition -- Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- as ""a godfather to terrorists everywhere."" The U.S. Treasury Department has identified Qatar as a host to shady private donors to terrorist organizations operating hundreds of miles away from its borders. In addition, it has irked monarchs like those in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi by previously backing the Islamist, quasi-democratic Muslim Brotherhood. To satisfy its Gulf neighbors as they scramble to unite, the Qatari government did recently ask top Brotherhood leaders to leave its capital.Reports suggest that the Qatari participation has thus far been only in a supporting role. Moreover, the Islamist factions that Qatari funders have been backing include al-Qaeda's affiliates in Syria -- such as the Khorasan Group, which the coalition targeted Monday night. So while Qatar publicly embraces the U.S.-led campaign, there is regional cynicism about its long-term goals.United Arab Emirates: The UAE's interests here are largely aligned with those of Saudi Arabia, Slim said. They both want to assert regional and international power. The Emiratis are less of an Islamic State target than the other Arab allies, but they too seek continued American backing and a friendly government in Syria that includes neither the Islamic State nor Assad.If anything, the Emiratis may be too enthusiastic to prove that they believe in the campaign:Headline from a UAE press release: ""UAE and Allies Launch Operation Against ISIL.""

Nunn supports moving forward with the pipeline, which will run from Canada to Texas and has become a focal point for environmental activists, who want the Obama administration to reject it. LCV has said that the decision whether to approve the pipeline is ""one of the most important decisions on climate change"" before the Obama administration.Earlier this month, Nunn released a television ad criticizing both fellow Democrats for ""dragging their feet"" on approving Keystone and Republicans for blocking renewable energy initiatives. The ad depicts Nunn as a moderate who will work to ""move beyond partisan bickering.""LCV Legislative Director Sara Chieffo said the group believes Nunn will be a strong supporter in the Senate on most of their key issues. ""We don’t always agree with candidates on everything,"" said Chieffo. ""She knows we have a moral obligation to act on climate change, and she's been clear she supports growing the clean energy economy. That's why we're happy to be supporting to her.""LCV is on pace to spend $25 million on independent political expenditures this year, five times more than the group spent in the last midterm election.

15,BUSINESS,Virgin's Unlimited Vacation Plan For Workers May Not Be As Good As It Seems,Alexander C.

But the policy may actually do more harm than good for some employees.“It is left to the employee to decide if and when he or she feels like taking a few hours, a day, a week or a month off, the assumption being that they are only going to do it when they feel a hundred percent comfortable ... that their absence will not in any way damage the business -- or, for that matter, their careers!"" Branson wrote in an excerpt from his new book, The Virgin Way, published on Virgin's blog.Branson said he was inspired by Netflix, another high-profile company that's done away with vacation days. In theory, Virgin’s rule, which currently applies U.S. and U.K. employees, should increase productivity and attract talent. Let workers take the time they need for their personal lives, so the thinking goes, and they will devote their work time wholly to their jobs. But there are downsides. Lotte Bailyn, a professor emeritus at the MIT Sloan School of Management, told The Huffington Post the lack of structure may make workers less comfortable with taking vacations.“This sounds not well thought-out,” Bailyn said in an interview. “People take less time off because they feel they’re not sure if this is really a commitment to them or that this is more a PR thing.”She said employees will look to senior staff to set the standards for how much time off is appropriate.“Typically, without any guidelines or structures, people don’t quite know what to make of this,” Bailyn said. “They tend to fall back on expectations they have formed in previous terms.”Spokespeople for Branson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Americans are infamously averse to vacations as it is. About 40 percent of U.S. workers don’t plan to use all their paid vacation time this year, according to a recent survey by the U.S. Travel Association and GfK, a market research firm. In a Daily Telegraph article that Branson cited in his blog post, Daniel H. Pink described the British perspective on vacations, which applies just as well to Americans: “[W]e view them as minor betrayals -- of our obligations to customers and clients, of our responsibilities to the colleagues left behind, even of the values we hold most dear.” In October 2009, two Harvard Business School researchers studied the results of forcing employees at the international management advisory firm Boston Consulting Group to take mandatory time off. Employees initially resisted. (That month, unemployment from the Great Recession peaked at about 10 percent.) But workers eventually embraced the required vacation days, and the policy preserved ""a strong, engaged pool of talent,"" the researchers wrote in the Harvard Business Review.Bruce Elliott, the manager of compensation and benefits at the Society for Human Resource Management, told HuffPost that the unlimited vacation policy can be positive at companies where the work is project-oriented.“They can say, ‘I just finished up a project, now is the perfect time to take a week off before the next one starts.’” Elliott said. But in an office where the work is generally ongoing and day-to-day schedules don't change as much, it can be harder to get employees to decide on their own how much vacation they deserve.The policy's effectiveness at Virgin will depend on the corporate culture, he said. “If Virgin has a culture with regard to transparency about its expectations, it could work,” Elliott said. “Absent that, who can say?”"
16,BUSINESS,Obamacare Critics Just Lost Another Talking Point,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-competition_n_5869710.html,,2014-09-23,"Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell speaks at a news conference at the Treasury Department in Washington, Monday, July 28, 2014, to discuss the release of the annual Trustees Reports.

Somebody forgot to tell the health insurance companies.More health insurers are signing on to participate in Obamacare, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said during a speech Tuesday at the Brookings Institution in Washington.The number of companies offering plans on the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchange marketplaces for 2015 will jump to 248, a 25 percent increase over this year, in the 44 states where the numbers are available.The department offered details in a report published at the time of Burwell's remarks.The increase in participating companies discredits a line of attack against the 4-year-old health care law that said it would crush competition.UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest insurers in the country, plans to sell coverage on exchanges in more than 20 states for 2015 after sitting out this year in many states where it offered other plans. The firm will join other big players including WellPoint, which sold more exchange plans than any other insurance carrier; Humana; and Aetna, along with numerous state-based Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. Some major insurance companies continue to avoid the exchanges, however. Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the leading insurer in Iowa and South Dakota, is staying out of the exchanges in those states for the second year of enrollment.Health insurance premiums tend to be lower in markets where multiple plans compete than in locales where one or two companies dominate. Although full information about premium prices on the Obamacare exchanges next year isn't yet available, the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates the average rise will be 7 percent. That is similar to or smaller than price hikes in the years before Obamacare, and rate increases and decreases will vary greatly across the country. The 25 percent increase in plans on the exchanges for next year represents 77 new health insurance companies joining and 14 leaving. According to the HHS report, California is the only state where fewer insurers will sell coverage on its exchange. Information wasn't provided about Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon or Vermont. Underscoring the volatility in this new health insurance market, Minnesota's exchange has lost its most popular insurer, meaning some customers will have to select new coverage for next year. Nine states included in the HHS report will have the same number of health insurance companies in their exchanges for next year as they did in 2014, but the remaining 34 states will have more. Notably, New Hampshire and West Virginia each had only one insurer selling policies on its exchange for last year; for 2015, the states will have five and two, respectively. Indiana will see the most new insurers, with options rising from four to nine. New York has the most insurers in its exchange with 17.Open enrollment on the health insurance exchanges begins Nov. 15 and runs through Feb. 15.An estimated 7.3 million people were fully enrolled in private health insurance plans purchased via the exchanges where people buy health insurance as of Aug. 15, Burwell disclosed last week. In addition, millions have been added to the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program rolls since the first Obamacare sign-up period started last October. As a result, more than 10 million previously uninsured people gained coverage, according to an analysis by HHS and the Harvard School of Public Health that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July.But Obamacare enrollment hasn't reached anywhere near its potential -- particularly in the private market. The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation estimates the Obamacare exchanges could ultimately sign up almost 29 million people for private health insurance.This story has been updated to replace outdated information from PricewaterhouseCoopers about projected health insurance increases next year.

We may be the last generation capable of curbing it.,2014-09-23,"NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 23: U.S. President Barack Obama speaks at the United Nations Climate Summit on September 23, 2014 in New York City. The summit, which is meeting one day before the UN General Assembly begins, is bringing together world leaders, scientists and activists looking to curb climate change. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15e6c240000500096c11f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Today, leaders from more than 120 countries gathered in New York. On the agenda: a challenge that knows no borders, produces devastating local impacts, and requires global action. President Obama joined the international community at the UN Secretary General's Climate Summit because he believes that we have a moral obligation to our children and to future generations to take decisive action now -- to reduce the carbon pollution and other greenhouse gas emissions warming the planet, and to build resilience to the climate impacts already being felt in communities across the country and around the world. We are the first generation to experience first-hand the chaos that climate scientists have long warned was coming. In recent years, we have been battered by more frequent and severe storms, become inundated by rising seas and storm surge, parched by deeper drought, and burned by fiercer wildfires. From the world's poorest villages to the tiniest seaside communities, climate change poses a real and dangerous threat. That's why the Obama Administration has sought to produce actionable climate science for the United States through the National Climate Assessment and has galvanized entrepreneurs and researchers to develop innovative climate planning tools through the Climate Data Initiative. And that's why, at today's UN Climate Summit, President Obama announced that he will marshal the United States' unparalleled research and technological capabilities to help developing countries understand the scope of the climate challenge and build climate resilience through a set of new global public goods. The President committed to releasing global elevation data at a higher resolution than is currently freely and publicly available. Today's declassification and release of 30-meter elevation data for the African continent is a vast improvement over the previous free, open data set, which resolved to 90 meters. This data will enable aid organizations, development banks, and decision-makers in developing countries to better map and plan for climate-driven challenges like sea level rise in coastal regions and glacial melting in mountain ranges. Our science agencies will work to develop extreme-weather risk outlooks extending beyond the two-week time horizon of weather forecasts, to provide early indication that severe weather may be on its way and help save lives around the world. NOAA will seek to expand a successful program that has already trained more than 300 meteorologists from developing countries in critical aspects of climate prediction, monitoring, and assessment. And the United States is going to continue to lead by example through a new executive order directing our international development agencies to factor climate resilience into their research, planning, and investment decisions--from malaria eradication programs to hospital construction to seed purchases. We're joining the new Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture, which seeks to preserve food security despite a changing climate. And the President today announced his intention to create a new public-private partnership to ensure climate data and tools are useful to, and used by, decision-makers in developing countries. But we know that without curbing the carbon pollution that is fueling global warming, the best data and tools we can imagine can only do so much to address the catastrophic impacts of climate change. Under President Obama's Climate Action Plan, the United States has claimed that mantle of leadership on this global challenge by putting America on the right path to achieve our 2009 Copenhagen pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. The President's plan will cut carbon pollution from existing power plants by 30 percent, thanks to a proposal set out by the Environmental Protection Agency this June. Partnerships between government and the private sector will deploy more clean energy, boost energy efficiency in more than 1 billion square feet of buildings, and phase down emissions of potent greenhouse gases known as HFCs -- super-pollutants with up to 10,000 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide -- by the equivalent of 700 million metric tons of CO2 by 2025. All told, the Obama Administration's actions since releasing the Climate Action Plan will cut nearly 3 billion tons of carbon pollution between 2020 and 2025, enable the development of more wind, solar, and geothermal energy, and save consumers more than $70 billion on their energy bills by 2030 -- all through executive action. Today's Summit is an important step in our fight against climate change -- and we're not stopping now. We're going to do more, at home and in international negotiations, to tackle this challenge. The United States remains committed to working through the UN process to forge a strong international framework to cut greenhouse gas emissions. And President Obama will continue using his pen and his phone to cut carbon pollution, to partner with the private sector, to deploy more clean energy, and to strengthen American communities threatened by climate impacts -- because we can't afford to wait for the climate denier caucus to take action. We're the first generation to witness the real devastation of climate change. We may be the last generation capable of curbing it. For the sake of our children, our country, and the global community, the United States will continue to use every tool available to us to tackle this challenge. This post is part of a month-long series produced by The Huffington Post in conjunction with a variety of events being held in September recognizing the threats posed by climate change. Those events include the UN's Climate Summit 2014 (that was held Sept. 23, 2014, at UN headquarters in New York) and Climate Week NYC (Sept. 22-28, 2014, throughout New York City).
