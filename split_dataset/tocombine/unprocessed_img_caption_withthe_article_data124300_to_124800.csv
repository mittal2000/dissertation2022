Like any other morning, I laced up my shoes, put on my Nike Dri-FIT, and walked out the door. I saw the same guy walking his dog and the same Starbucks customer sitting at the counter window. This morning was normal.  I got to the gym, swiped myself in, and threw my stuff in the locker room. I hopped on the treadmill, strolled through a five-minute warm up, and headed for the iron. This is where my routine took a left turn.  Normally, I never listen to music while lifting. I feel like it distracts me and takes away from my concentration. For some reason, this day, I wanted to try something new. Luckily, my headphones were in my jacket from yesterday's cardio session. I took them out, plugged them in, and the rest was indescribable.  Most people think I'm crazy when I tell them I don't like listening to music while hitting the weights. Don't get me wrong, while running, it's probably the best thing ever. But while lifting, I always felt I would be distracted singing the lyrics or imagining the music video in my head. Boy, was I wrong.  When I slid underneath the bench press, ready to conquer my PR, I turned the music on, and boom. Killed my personal record by four reps. I was in awe. Was it the music? Was it the Dri-FIT?  It was the music.  Throughout the whole workout, I was choosing different songs from random playlists and in the end, created the ultimate, iron-smashing group of songs that can get you through any grueling workout.  The genres range from rap, pop, and house.  So if you're about to smash shoulders or light up your chest, throw this playlist on for some serious gains... but first, let me take a #Selfie.#Selfie - The Chainsmokers Animals - Martin Garrix Boy Oh Boy - Diplo & GTA Dark Horse - Katy Perry Shirt Off - Blank Bird Machine - DJ Snake Ode To Oi - TJR Perfect Day - Dj Antoine vs. Mad Mark Sweet Nothing - Calvin Harris, Florence Welch We Found Love - Calvin Harris, Rihanna Only The Horses - Scissor Sisters  Timber - Pitbull, Kesha I Choose You - Timeflies Touch - Raquel feat.

I've been very open about my own issues with anxiety and have gone so far as going on Oprah's Lifeclass to discuss the largest anxiety provoking situation of my life over four episodes on OWN. It bears repeating: Depression and anxiety affect more than 40 million people in the United States alone. So when I hear another young artist so fearlessly discussing his own struggles, I quickly stand up and take notice.You know Mike Posner from hits like ""Cooler Than Me"" and ""Please Don't Go."" You've heard the songs he's written for other artists like Justin Bieber's ""Boyfriend,"" but beyond his hits and fame is a true artist with a true message. I recently attended Mike's Unplugged Tour and got to witness his artistry first hand. Before one particular song, ""Save Your Goodbye,"" Mike told the crowd that though the song may seem like it's about a relationship, it's actually about his struggle with depression. He then began singing the song accompanied as it had been written -- with only an acoustic guitar. I was in tears. Here is a popular millennial with the world ahead of him that so bravely put it all out on the table. Depression (and in my case, anxiety) aren't a joke. We can longer continue to push these issues into the corner. We must talk about them over and over and over again until the stigma is gone completely. Suffering from depression and anxiety can be debilitating (and possibly worse) if gone untreated. Treatment is simply a phone call away. It can be managed effectively and often times, go away completely. Codi, my friend that had attended the show with me, had know Mike for his party songs. As we were on our way home, he asked me what other ""deep"" songs Mike had that I could play for him. That is why we must not stop talking about it. That is why we need to continue to create and speak out. It is only through speaking out about our own issues that the stigma lessens. With each time we speak about it to another person a chip comes off the rock that is the stigma of mental health. I'm ready to have that rock be non-existent, are you? Let's talk about it in the comments.Watch Mike Posner's performance of Save Your Goodbye live from the Unplugged Tour 3/31/14 and be sure to pick up his new album Pages, due out this summer.Watch K.Mac's music video for ""A Letter 2 My Younger Self.""If you or someone you know feels like you may be dealing with anxiety or depression and don't know where to get help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to speak with a trained counselor. Kyle McMahon, the recording artist known as K.Mac, is a millennial who has recently appeared on a series of Oprah's Lifeclass specials, writes about self improvement for millennials and gives speeches on fatherless sons.

2,WEDDINGS,7 Things to Consider Before Your Engagement Shoot,"Clane Gessel, Contributor
Award-winning wedding photographer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/7-things-to-consider-befo_us_5b9df625e4b03a1dcc8f96ad,It's not simply looking your best and plastering a smile across your face -- it's about making sure you are prepared and setting yourself up for an enjoyable experience.,2014-04-04,2014-04-04-Engagementphotographytipsuseyourresources.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-04-04-Engagementphotographytipsuseyourresources-thumb.jpg,"Lauren Hardy for Clane Gessel PhotographyLast Saturday, my fiancé and I woke up with big smiles on our faces. It was the day of our engagement shoot -- a day we'd been looking forward to for a very long time. As a teenager, I would often pause romantic movies at my favorite spots. I wanted to capture the precious moments, so I could put myself in the actresses' shoes, with my future fiancé standing by my side. Now nearing 22, I was excited for the two of us to finally be in the spotlight. The difference between those romantic movie shots and an engagement shoot? I learned quickly that there are many additional things couples must consider in real-life before they step in front of the camera. It's not simply looking your best and plastering a smile across your face -- it's about making sure you are prepared and setting yourself up for an enjoyable experience. Here are 7 things every couple should keep in mind before their engagement shoot:1) Don't wait until the last minute to decide what to wearMaybe this is a no-brainer for you. If fashion is your passion, chances are you've had the wardrobe planned out for months. On the other hand, some of us push it to the back of our minds. We tell ourselves we'll worry about it later, or assume that our significant others will know how to dress themselves accordingly.Wrong... I made the mistake of waiting until the hour before our shoot to discuss with my fiancé what he was planning to wear. (This is coming from a woman who might as well be a wedding planner for as much as she likes to organize and schedule.) I told him what I was wearing and he looked at me with a blank stare as to say, so what am I supposed to wear again? I expected him to be able to just match my style in the blink of an eye. But that's not how wardrobe pairing works. Give yourself some wiggle room. Talk about outfits a few weeks before the big day. Start with a broad approach and select four possible outfits, then narrow it down to the ones that go together the best, and fit your personality and love for each other.2) Take advantage of the resources you already haveWho says you have to go to the mall and purchase an entirely new outfit? A month before our shoot, I had this idea in my head that I HAD to buy a brand new dress. I went to the Mall of America and browsed the racks of more than 15 stores to find something new. After my search turned up empty, I had an epiphany: Maybe I could wear clothes I already owned, but pair them in a way that was special and unique to our shoot. In the end I ended up saving a lot of money, and I also feel like the photos have more meaning, too. 3) Watch the weather and see if you're photographer is flexibleOur original shoot was scheduled for a week earlier than the day we actually had it... The problem was, when we checked the weather for that original date (3 degrees Fahrenheit), we noticed that it was going to be 25 degrees warmer the following weekend. We needed to make a change, and luckily, our photographers were flexible and rescheduled. It's a good idea to talk with your photographer about what their availability is and rescheduling dates before it needs to happen. Another reason why it's good to watch the weather: It can help you make better wardrobe choices! Is your shoot inside or outside? These are questions that effect what you end up wearing.4) No shoot is perfectEven though the day of our shoot was 25 degrees warmer than the original day it had been scheduled, it was still cold outside -- 28 degrees to be exact, and that's before the wind chill! By no means was our shoot like the romantic movies I grew up in awe of. But that's OK, because it was special and unique. Remember that even though having beautiful photos is important, having a beautiful moment and overall experience is what matters the most.5) Consider the length of the shootThe number of scenes and photos you want influences the amount of time you will spend on the engagement shoot. Because my fiancé and I were only doing two scenes, I assumed that we would be done in a couple of hours. The reality? It ended up taking four hours. Pack snacks and beverages along for the ride. You never know how long your shoot is going to take, and you don't want to get hungry or thirsty during the process. 6) Be mindful of your schedule for the entire dayEngagement shoots are exhausting! It doesn't matter how much you love the person -- after hours of smiling, posing, standing and changing outfits, you will be tired! Keep this in mind and keep the rest of your day's schedule light so that you won't feel overwhelmed. Maybe even plan to get dinner out that night, too.7) It really is all about youThis is the time to show off your love. If you are in a public place, don't worry about the people around you. Be comfortable in your own skin and do what comes naturally. If a pose feels forced, mix it up. Nothing is set in stone. A photographer might offer suggestions, but you cans steer the ship wherever your heart's compass leads."
3,MONEY,Five Surefire Ways to Torpedo Your Investment Portfolio,"Lisa Colletti, Contributor

Taking the right precautions, however, keeps risk to a minimum.",2014-04-04,"'Have No Regrets' --Richard Branson, Founder of Virgin Group",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dbc28240000320053b4ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"When you first learned to drive a car, you probably didn't handle the car like a NASCAR racer; you fumbled around with the stick shift or hit the accelerator too hard, maybe even running up on the curb. Watching a beginner in any field is ugly. It's the same with investing. Like any skilled craft, it takes practice and discipline. Unfortunately, the stakes are higher than in most fields -- sometimes, your life savings are at risk. Retail investors -- that is, everyday people and not corporations -- face two seemingly unpalatable choices: Step into the arena of the financial markets, and place their savings at risk, or park their money in a savings account and let inflation erode the value of their money as the years pass by. Fortunately, the dilemma is more imaginary than real. Average people can profit from investing by learning to mitigate risk. Investing well is a lifelong pursuit, but a little knowledge can prevent you from making disastrous mistakes with your finances.In my own career, I've seen amateur investors make the same mistakes repeatedly, with cringe-inducing results. In the police line-up of bad investments, these are the usual suspects. Steer clear of them and you'll avoid getting mugged by the markets.1. Investing in industries you don't understand.Several years back, I came across the executive of a local bank who had owned a large chunk of stock in his own company. Sometime in the late 90s, on the advice of a broker, he liquidated most of this stock and decided to diversify his investments. At that time, the stock market was in the middle of the dot.com boom and investors were throwing money at start-up companies, completely overlooking the soundness of these companies as businesses. Mr. Bank Executive had friends who invested in tech stocks and earned absurd returns of 80 percent or more per year, and of course he wanted to cash in on the stock bonanza. He invested exclusively in software companies, even though this guy never used the products they produced or had more than a vague idea of what they did. You can guess what happened; by 2002, he had lost about two-thirds of a million dollar portfolio after the dot.com bust and the post-September 11 slump demolished the companies he had invested in.The moral is this: If you want to pick your own stocks, as opposed to letting a fund manager do it for you, you must do your research and look at the fundamentals of the company. Warren Buffet, the richest investor in the world, spends countless hours examining the SEC filings and shareholder reports of the companies in which he invests. He repeatedly warns investors to stay away from companies that make products and services they don't understand. 2. Basing calculations solely on past results.Around 2004 or so, our company advised a client who owned a successful auto parts business. He was middle-aged, with years of business experience under his belt and roughly a million dollars in savings that he was looking to invest. Mr. Business Owner found a sure-fire method of picking stocks: Look at a stock chart, find the stocks that had risen the fastest in the past and invest in those. His reasoning rested on the assumption that the stocks that had risen in the past will continue to rise in the future, because the future must always resemble the past. But of course, applying such crude logic to everyday life would yield ridiculous results: If you lobbed a hammer into the air, you wouldn't assume that it would continue to rise infinitely simply because it had continued to travel upward for the last few seconds. The key to selecting stocks is to find companies that are undervalued with a potential for growth, and buy them before their value increases. Though our guy's method seemed logical on a superficial level, it revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of the market: Sometimes an increase in a stock's price can't be sustained because the stock is overrated or the company has maxed out its potential for growth. As a result of this mistake and other errors, the business owner lost about $100,000 of his portfolio value. (Eventually, he turned the entire portfolio over to my company, and we were able to help him recoup his losses with a more nuanced investing approach.)3. Focusing on the level of return only.Mr. Business Owner made another gross error. He developed a kind of tunnel vision that caused him to look at the growth of a particular stock without any regard to risk, which led him to invest mainly in small cap and international growth stocks while neglecting safer (but duller) blue chip stocks. His goal was to earn a 15 percent annual return on his stocks. But of course, you don't get something for nothing: in order to make that kind of return, you have to assume heavy risk -- a burden that he ultimately couldn't stomach. As a result, he ended up selling his stocks when the market bottomed out and using the money to buy low-yielding certificates of deposit. This brings me to the next point...4. Pulling your investments in and out of the market at random intervals.Another client of ours was an office manager who had a healthy amount of money in a 401k account with her employer, who managed her funds prudently. However, she sliced off a section of her savings, calling it her ""fun money,"" and decided to get a higher rate of return by investing it on her own. Luckily, she invested most of this money in reliable blue-chip stocks. Her stock choices were fundamentally sound, but the problem was her inability to pick a strategy and stick to it.Several times, the markets got rough and even her blue-chip stocks underperformed. She then called me and my partner and directed us to sell off her stocks. She told us that she wanted to get out of the markets, protect her wealth, and ""wait until the market got better.""""How do you know when things will get better?"" we asked her. ""It's not as though a bell will ring and tell you when the markets are safe."" She replied, ""I feel it in my bones that it's time to get out."" Against our advice, she pulled her money out of the stock market and placed her money in low-interest CDs. Naturally, when the market started to go up again, she regretted her decision and directed us to reinvest the money in stocks. And then -- you guessed it -- stock prices would decline, she would pull the money out, and the same pattern would repeat itself.This client had an uncanny knack for doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. Her intuition was the best predictor of short-term stock movements that the world had ever seen -- except that stock prices always moved in exactly the opposite direction of what she expected. If she had left her money in, the stock values would have eventually returned to their previous levels, she would have recouped her losses, and she would have started earning a profit again from the power of compound interest. Instead, over a period of four years, she ended up losing about half of the $50,000 she had invested. You might be a conservative investor or an aggressive investor, but you need to decide on an investment strategy and stick with it. In the long run, the markets tend to move upward. If you keep moving your investments in and out of stocks, then you're depriving yourself of the ability to earn interest on your money.5. Dumping your life savings in one investment.Will company x be the next Google, or will it be the next Enron? No one knows, really. Market analysts can devise sophisticated metrics and analyze the company's finances, but no one can really predict whether a company will succeed or fail. That's why financial planners keep repeating the mantra of diversification. Of all the lessons of investing, this is the most important. I've seen lack of diversification produce some disastrous results. A case in point:Before the housing bust, my company took on another local businessman as a client, this one the owner of a successful construction business. At age 50, he had become a self-made millionaire in ten years, creating a business worth $25 million. During a meeting with him, we found that his entire net worth was completely tied up in his own company (he even had an unpaid mortgage on his home).Though the business was doing well at that time, we saw a red flag: It's unwise to put all of your wealth in any one investment, no matter how sound it appears. So, we advised him to save off about $5 million of his equity in the company and use the money to pay off his mortgage and set up a well-diversified portfolio of stocks, CDs, municipal bonds, and alternative assets (oil, currency, commodities, etc.). He only partly followed our advice: He invested some money in municipal bonds, but then turned around and put the bonds up as collateral on a bank loan to buy new equipment.Around 2008, the great housing bust hit California, and our client's construction empire crumbled. Demand for building slowed down, revenue dried up and he could no longer pay his creditors. His construction business collapsed. The bank repossessed the municipal bonds when he stopped making loan payments. And to add insult to injury, he even lost his home. He ended up bankrupt. It was a stunning reversal of fortune.I admit that this is an unusual, worst-case scenario. But lack of diversification can be a serious wealth assassin.No investment method is foolproof; if anyone tells you otherwise, hold onto your wallet. Taking the right precautions, however, keeps risk to a minimum. If you don't feel comfortable making your own investment choices, then it's okay to turn your portfolio over to a professional fund manager -- after all, not everyone feels confident enough to install the wiring in their house or fix the transmission in their car. Sometimes a professional can save you time and money. Always remember: your money is a fragile resource, so handle it with care."
