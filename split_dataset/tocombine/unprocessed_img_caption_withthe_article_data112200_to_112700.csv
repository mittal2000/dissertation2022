Fifty years later, it is still being sung at services and protests in Ferguson, Missouri. ""We Shall Overcome"" is the best known, most beloved of all of the freedom songs and protest spirituals, but a host of other songs were sung as well. Some have their origins in the Antebellum South, when slaves sought -- and sometimes fought -- for their freedom from slavery. Others evolved during the modern civil rights movement, from Montgomery to Memphis, in hundreds of towns and villages in Alabama, Mississippi and beyond. With that almost apostolic succession in mind, here is a suggested soundtrack for Ferguson:10. ""We Shall Not be Moved"" and ""Which Side Are You On?"": When labor unions finally began admitting African Americans in the 1930s and '40s, labor protesters quickly absorbed and adapted the great protest spirituals. ""In That Great Getting' Up Morning,"" for instance, became ""In that Great Union Morning."" These two old union songs were quickly adopted and expanded by the civil rights movement of the '50s and '60s.9. ""Lining out"": This ancient musical call and response is still practiced in many African American churches today. A song-leader sings or speaks a line and the congregation at a mass meeting or protesters on the courthouse steps sing it back. One of the most popular lined-out hymn during the movement was the old hymn, ""A Charge to Keep Have I.""8. ""Up Above My Head, I Hear Freedom in the Air"": This is an adaptation of a Sister Rosetta Tharpe song from the 1940s, which she adapted from an old spiritual. It was then appropriated by demonstrators in the great singing protests of Albany, Georgia.7. ""Woke Up This Morning With My Mind Stayed on Freedom"": This one particularly enraged jailers, whether in Parchman or tiny, one-room jails in one-horse Alabama towns. Singing it usually resulted in a loss of food ""privileges,"" mattresses and showers, and sometimes ended with the singers placed in the dreaded isolated boxes. But the singing usually continued.6. ""This May Be the Last Time"": Usually sung solemnly before a journey where the end destination could result in beatings, imprisonment and -- sometimes -- death.5. ""Keep Your Eyes on the Prize""/""Hold On"": There are dozens of variations of this civil rights era favorite. Most include the couplet about Paul and Silas in jail, but all were sung to bolster spirits in tough times.4. ""This Little Light of Mine"": This old spiritual was made popular in Mississippi by the indomitable Fannie Lou Hamer. It was easily adaptable to every situation and good for naming the names of your oppressors.3. ""We'll Never Turn Back"": Bertha Gober's magisterial hymn to the fallen is one of the most beautiful and haunting of the many songs composed for the movement. It was sung too often at gravesides and during memorial services in Alabama and Mississippi in 1963-5.2. ""Ain't Nobody Gonna Turn Me Around"": This was the favorite of the youngest freedom protesters everywhere. It had definite Stax/Volt beat and lent itself well to a tone of defiance everywhere. It was another freedom song that was infinitely adaptable to the situation.1. ""We Shall Overcome"": Few songs can match the majesty and soulful power of ""We Shall Overcome,"" always sung standing, with arms crossed clasping the hands of those on either side. It has been sung in the Arab Spring, the Eastern European uprisings, Tiananmen Square and every significant event where African Americans are gathered. It is at its most powerful -- then and now -- when the lines ""black and white together"" are included.The freedom songs and protest spirituals comprise an extraordinary body of work. They have endured and continue to be sung because they work. Whether to comfort the afflicted, inspire the hopeless, calm the enraged, or make clear the singers' defiance in the face of violence and oppression, they possess a power that extends far beyond the mere combination of words and music.Robert Darden's upcoming book, Nothing But Love in God's Water: Black Sacred Music from the Civil War to the Civil Rights Movement. Volume I, which covers the influence of protest spirituals and freedom songs through the Montgomery bus boycott, will be published in October by Penn State University Press."

But in all honesty, it's the acceptances speeches that make the show worth while. Often poignant and filled with tears, others are hilarious and goofy. Here are the craziest Emmy Awards acceptances speeches:Kristin Chenoweth -- ""Pushing Daisies"" (2009)The actress won the award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for ""Pushing Daisies"" and was so shocked she started crying. Besides the goofy glasses that all the nominees (except Vanessa Williams) wore before the winner was announced, this speech stands out because Chenoweth also used it to get a job. ""I'm unemployed now, so I'd like to be on 'Mad Men.' I also like 'The Office' and '24,'"" she joked before she left the stage.Julia Louis-Dreyfus -- ""Veep"" (2012)What happens when you get on stage to accept your award and suddenly you realize you're reading the wrong speech? That's what happened to Julia Louis-Dreyfus when she won her first Lead Actress Emmy for ""Veep"" in 2012. She and Amy Poehler switched speeches, but Poehler saved the day at the last minute, and also included a little surprise at the end.Ricky Gervais/Steve Carell -- ""Extras"" (2007)There was just one problem when Ricky Gervais won the Emmy for Lead Actor in a Comedy for ""Extras"" -- he wasn't there! So Steven Colbert and Jon Stewart decided to just give the award to one of his contenders, Steve Carell. Carell rushed the stage, grabbed the Emmy and the three funny guys jumped around the stage in glee as if they'd all won. It's okay though, because Gervais stole his golden statue back the following year.Greg Garcia -- ""My Name Is Earl"" (2006)Greg Garcia, creator and executive producer of ""My Name Is Earl,"" accepted the Emmy for Comedy Writing in 2006. Rather than giving thanks in his speech, Garcia decided to switch things up and name everyone he didn't want to thank. Some included his eighth-grade social studies teacher, a former boss and God for making him go bald.Julia Louis-Dreyfus -- ""Veep"" (2013)You can always count on Julia Louis-Dreyfus to keep award speeches entertaining. When the ""Veep"" actress won again in 2013 for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy, her co-star Tony Hale had just won Best Supporting Actor minutes before. He came on stage (in character) and stood behind her nodding and smiling in support as she ran through her thank-you list, which hilariously didn't include him.The 66th Primetime Emmy Awards air Monday, Aug. 25, at 8 p.m. ET on NBC."

'Defending the border is not a political option, it is a constitutional obligation,' Perry said. Photographer: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d306210000d601c96443.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What do Governors Perry, Christie, and Cuomo have in common? All three are governors of big and important states, all three are accomplished bullies, and all three have used bullying tactics recently for overreaching political objectives. Governor Perry, a Republican, tried to coerce the Travis County District Attorney, a Democrat, into resigning and when she refused, he vetoed funding for the Public Integrity Unit that Perry wanted to get rid of. Governor Christie, a Republican, sought the endorsement of the democratic mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, and when he refused to endorse him, Christie retaliated by dumping thousands of motorists into a massive traffic graveyard on the George Washington Bridge. Governor Cuomo, a Democrat, wanted the New York legislature to enact a package of so-called ""Public Trust"" laws, and when the lawmakers balked, Cuomo retaliated by empaneling a prosecutor-studded investigation commission to investigate the lawmakers and use its massive subpoena powers to expose and embarrass them.   Governor Perry has been indicted for criminal coercion by using his official position to threaten another person with harm unless that person comply with the governor's demands. Perry has called his indictment a ""farce,"" and editorials have questioned its validity. But the essence of the crime of coercion, in Texas, and also New Jersey and New York, is simple and straightforward: it consists of compelling a person by intimidation to engage or refrain from engaging in certain conduct that the person threatened has a right to engage in. Our culture disparages bullying, and we often punish bullies, whether in schools, workplaces, or the military. Why should governors be exempt when they abuse their power and, like other bullies, intimidate persons who are at their mercy into succumbing to their demands?  To be sure, the line between bare knuckle politics and criminal coercion is vague. Governor Perry clearly possesses the legal authority to veto the funding legislation. And Governor Cuomo clearly has the legal authority to create the Moreland Commission to investigate government misconduct. It's the reason for the use of this power that matters. Criminal law focuses on the actor's mental state. Only Governor Christie, it appears, lacks any legal authority for his bizarre and inexcusable conduct in willfully engineering the injurious traffic-jam stunt.  Is Governor Perry's indictment an overreach by a misguided special prosecutor? I don't think so. The charges of abusing his office and coercing a public official are well within the Texas criminal statutes. His threat to force out of office District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg was motivated by Perry's revulsion at the work of Lehmberg's Public Integrity Unit, which was investigating Perry cronies and donors for financial fraud and other wrongful conduct. Threatening to defund the Unit unless Lehmberg resigned would seem to fit well within the coercion statute. To be sure, Lehmberg had seriously compromised her position by getting arrested for drunken driving. And she made a fool of herself at the police station. But Perry didn't seek her resignation because of the arrest. The arrest was merely the pretext for Perry to gratuitously insinuate himself into the case, and to throttle her anti-corruption unit. With her out, he could appoint a republican District Attorney who would neutralize the unit.   Governor Christie's conduct involves a tacit threat to all New Jersey political officials; endorse me or you will be punished. That may be the myriad dirty stuff of hardball politics, but Christie took the threat to an unusually toxic level. And his attempt to pawn off his personal liability on underlings is not the sort of conduct that endears him to friends or foes. And by the way, he's still being investigated by federal and state prosecutors.  Governor Cuomo also made tacit threats which appear to fit well within New York's criminal coercion law. According to one of the co-chairs of the Moreland Commission, William Fitzpatrick, the District Attorney of Onondaga County, Cuomo threatened the Legislature dozens of times that I they didn't pass his ethics bill, he was going to appoint a commission to investigate them, which he did. And the commission used its vast investigative machinery punitively, issuing a flood of subpoenas to every lawmaker, law firm, and business with which the lawmaker is or was associated. The legislature ultimately capitulated to Cuomo's demands by enacting a few modest ethics laws, and Cuomo, claiming victory, disbanded the commission. Is Governor Cuomo guilty of coercion? According to the clear language of N.Y. Penal Law § 135.60, sub. 8, person is guilty of coercion if he ""induces another person [lawmakers] to engage in conduct which the other person [lawmakers] has a legal right to abstain from engaging in by means of instilling a fear that, if the demand is not complied with, the actor or another will use or abuse his position as a public servant by performing some act within or related to his or her official duties in such manner as to affect some person [lawmakers] adversely."" It seems fairly clear, no?Governors Perry, Christie, and Cuomo appear to have engaged in the type of intimidating and coercive tactics that all bullies use. And coercion, no matter who does it, is a crime, not politics as usual. Perry got caught. Christie and Cuomo have escaped so far."

Sorbo took to Facebook Wednesday, Aug. 20, to discuss the Ferguson protestors who have been calling for justice since the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9. The actor criticized those who have been gathering in the St. Louis suburb for having what he said are ulterior motives. ""Ferguson riots have very little to do with the shooting of the young man,"" Sorbo wrote. ""It is an excuse to be the losers these animals truly are. It is a tipping point to frustration built up over years of not trying, but blaming everyone else, The Man, for their failures. It's always someone else's fault when you give up. Hopefully this is a reminder to the African Americans ( I always thought we just Americans. Oh, well.) that their President the voted in has only made things worse for them, not better.""He then copy and pasted a portion of text from an article written by Alicia Colon for the Jewish World Review titled ""Media Clueless About the Inner City."" In her article, Colon -- who is also a Breitbart columnist -- accuses the press of catering to ""media whores seek only to generate news that reflects their own bleeding heart ideology."" The media's frenzy that descended upon Ferguson, Mo. once again demonstrates its complete ignorance of life in the inner city. Anyone who has survived the barrios and the ghettos would recognize the usual cast of characters that converge on these incidents and would stay far away from them. But no-these media lapdogs shove mikes in their faces and actually believe their 'eyewitness' versions that nearly always turn out to be bogus and nothing other than a self-serving photo op.Conservative rantings are nothing new from Sorbo, who currently appears in Investigation Discovery's ""Heartbreakers."" Earlier this week, Sorbo dubbed atheists ""angry"" while promoting his recent film, ""God Is Not Dead,"" in which he plays an atheist, according to RawStory. Last year, he took aim at Hollywood for liberal hypocrisy."

DuBois, The Souls of Black FolkThe nation's focus on the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri confers yet another opportunity for deeper racial understanding, but like other (too many other) teachable moments arising from the tragic loss of young black life, the opportunity is fleeting and frail. To make the most of it, the nation will need to embrace decades of research about how unconscious biases continue to shape how black males are perceived in public, and impede their access to opportunity and even threaten their lives.The African American community has a deep and painful understanding of the negative assumptions about black people -- particularly black males -- that can distort their encounters with strangers. The expression of these assumptions has changed over time, but honest reflection about the trail of deaths of unarmed young black men counsels us that harmful stereotypes continue to corrupt these interactions with grievous consequences. In earlier decades, black Americans were openly warned about the consequences of breaking the unwritten discriminatory rules that governed their daily lives. Not infrequently these warnings came from members of police forces themselves -- ""Don't let the sun go down on you here, boy."" -- through unwarranted stops, arrests, threats, beatings, and worse. Today, we have a broadened acceptance that the Constitution's equal protection guarantees demand better treatment of African Americans and a more elevated racial discourse. This is real racial progress. It is why when an NBA team owner is taped warning his mistress not to bring black men to his team's games, the nation has no trouble denouncing him. But it would be a grave disservice to ourselves and the nation we aspire to be to extrapolate from that consensus that chance encounters between black males and others are governed by fair treatment and mutual respect. Unconscious bias research shows that black men and boys are quickly, automatically and routinely linked in the human mind with violence, crime, aggression and danger. Neurologists have documented that the amygdala, the part of the brain that registers threats and fears, is activated in the same way when observing images of unfamiliar black faces as when observing images of snakes and spiders. The result of millions of on-line takers of the ""Implicit Association Test"" designed by Harvard researchers show that the vast majority of test takers are able to link positive words and attributes more quickly with whites than with blacks, and to link negative words and attributes more quickly with blacks than with whites. This extensive IAT research has uncovered a pro-White/anti-Black bias in most Americans regardless of their racial group. ""Shooter Studies"" revealed that police participants in a video game simulation who were instructed to ""shoot"" individuals who wielded a threatening object (gun or other weapon) but to refrain from shooting individuals holding innocuous objects (cellphone, wallet, etc.), were found to mistakenly shoot more unarmed black targets than unarmed White targets, and to fail to shoot more armed white targets than armed black targets. The implications of unconscious bias research are never graver than when thinking about the quickly unfolding interactions that occur each day between black males and the police, such as that between Officer Darren Wilson and Michael Brown in Ferguson last week. Researchers are exploring ways to build new, better cognitive associations that align more closely with our desire to view and treat others fairly irrespective of race. To get there will demand many things, including: a willingness to face our implicit biases with honesty and self-reflection, and a resolve to diversify our spaces of consequence -- our workplaces, schools and neighborhoods -- so that through increased meaningful contact with each other, stereotypes can give way to deeper understanding and mutual regard. Black Americans know this and are raising their voices with calls for change. The appropriate response from our police is transparent accountability, not military tanks, and the hoped for response from our fellow citizens is one of solidarity and a singularity of purpose to get to that better us.Sharon Davies is the Executive Director of the Kirwan Institute at The Ohio State University, and author of Rising Road: A True Tale of Love, Race and Religion in America."

The airline has launched a new 72-hour ""hold fare"" option that requires only a $10 deposit, meaning you'll never miss out on a good deal again.According to an August 21 press release, travelers who see a sweet British Airways deal can reserve their flight at that price, pay $10 and, within 72 hours, decide whether or not they actually want the flight. If they do, the $10 deposit is refunded and the tickets can be purchased. “There’s nothing more frustrating than seeing a great flight price but not being able to book it straight away, either because you may need to get the time off work or check it’s ok with family or friends – then coming back and finding there are no seats left or the price has changed,"" said Drew Crawley, British Airways' chief commercial officer. If multiple people are traveling together, only one passenger's name is required to hold the flights -- all the others can be added later. The $10 deposit is required for each seat held (so a two-passenger hold will cost $20), and seats can be held in bookings done up to 21 days before takeoff. It's no wonder this sweet idea is happening on British Airways, as they've been the talk of the skies recenltly.

Obama's plan would allow states to opt out of portions of the George W. Bush era education initiative. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d33c2600002d0183ba00.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For years, the Obama administration has made tougher teacher evaluations a centerpiece of its education agenda, giving states incentives to grade educators partially in accordance with students' standardized test scores. But on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan announced most states will get a reprieve of sorts. Deborah Delisle, assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education, wrote in a Thursday letter to state school chiefs that states that have received waivers from the No Child Left Behind Act will be able to continue to evade the law even if they did not use test scores in this year's teacher evaluations. But states are still required to show the test scores to teachers. ""Testing should never be the main focus of our schools ... No test can ever measure what a student is, or can be,"" Duncan wrote in a blog post Thursday. ""Testing issues today are sucking the oxygen out of the room in a lot of schools.""Beyond the question of when states have to use test scores in teacher evaluations, Duncan said states can request other types of flexibility. ""We want to make sure that they are still sharing growth data with their teachers, and still moving forward on the other critical pieces of evaluation systems that provide useful feedback to educators,"" Duncan wrote.The letter built on previous incremental announcements about the administration's piecemeal changes to the waiver program. No Child Left Behind, the 2001 much-maligned George W. Bush law that mandated regular standardized testing, expired in 2007. After Congress failed to rewrite it, Duncan and President Barack Obama told states in 2011 that they could escape some of its components by agreeing to policies preferred by the Education Department. Since then, more than 40 states have garnered the waivers, but 35 states' waivers expire this summer. So far, 18 have received one-year extensions.States that received the waivers were expected to fully implement their new teacher evaluation systems by this school year. But that deadline coincides with the first year during which states are supposed to be using tests aligned to their newer, higher standards, another waiver requirement. (In many states, these tests are aligned to the Common Core State Standards, a controversial set of items that dictates what students are expected to know by the end of each grade in math and English language arts.) Many teachers and their unions have warned that the confluence of these two drastic changes could spell major trouble because of the statistical pitfalls of using new tests to measure student growth, as well as the simple fact that changes might require time for adjustment.So with these challenges, parents rebelling against standardized testing and the pressure of No Child Left Behind advocates who said the waivers didn't do enough to hold schools accountable for the teaching of disadvantaged students, Duncan found himself in a pickle of sorts. Should he continue to push hard on the administration's banner priority of rigorous teacher evaluations, or should he ease the pressure, and risk the perception that the Education Department has little leverage as it phases out NCLB?Thursday's announcement proved to be something of a middle path. ""This announcement cannot be viewed as a gift to people who have chosen not to take the harder path,"" said John White, Louisiana's school superintendent. (Louisiana's waiver extension process is up in the air amid Gov. Bobby Jindal's (R) attempts to move the state away from the Common Core as the school year begins.) ""When making an announcement that they are going to relax some of those stiff requirements for accountability, they should send a clear signal that states that have maintained stringent accountability commitments and kept true to their long term plan have done the right thing,"" White said. ""There are a lot of people out with scars on their backs who did the right thing and whose efforts should be respected because they saw through the commitments that they made five years ago."" One such state is New Mexico, which has not revised its evaluation timeline under the waivers. ""We believe education decisions affecting the states should be made by the states,"" said New Mexico's school chief, Hanna Skandera. ""That's why New Mexico was an early supporter of the administration's efforts to offer waivers allowing states to develop local reforms that best serve our students.""The news follows the May announcement that the Education Department would consider extending waivers in states whose evaluation systems were not at the level of implementation originally promised. Some were pleased with Thursday's move, which comes as the administration faces criticism for being overly prescriptive in its use of waivers. Earlier this summer, congressional Republicans Rep. John Kline (Minn.) and Sen. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the waivers. They emphasized in their request that ""states were required to comply with a new set of requirements, not authorized by Congress.""Others questioned the premise of the evaluations, most of which rely on a metric called ""value-added,"" which is supposed to tease out a teacher's impact on student test scores, stripping away external factors such as poverty and previous academic performance. ""Value-added doesn't work, it's a cruel hoax,"" said Lily Eskelsen García, president-elect of the National Education Association. ""Whether this department is giving you a waiver for one year but afterwards you still use an equation that makes no sense, we will still be working to eliminate anything that serves a high-stakes consequences with the value-added voodoo number.""Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, called the move a good start. ""The Department's admission today that testing has gone too far is a good step, if there is a real course-correction that is linked to concrete action and not just words,"" she said.Carmel Martin, Center for American Progress' executive vice president for policy, said in a statement that the announcement ""marks an important move toward better, fewer, and fairer tests.""""Secretary Duncan’s announcement and remarks addressing concerns about the quantity and quality of student assessments and their connection to teacher evaluations is a significant step in the right direction,"" said Martin, who was previously at the Department of Education. ""Allowing for more time and flexibility to ensure fair educator evaluations based on the new student assessments shows a willingness to listen and learn from parents, teachers, and students.""Read Delisle's letter below: Department of Education LetterThis post has been updated to include statements from Randi Weingarten and Carmel Martin and to add Delisle's letter.

10,POLITICS,Key Senate Race Deeply Divides Men And Women,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-senate_n_5697624.html,,2014-08-21,"UNITED STATES - JULY 22: Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., conducts a meeting in the Senate Reception Room of the Capitol, July 22, 2014. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d33d200000f90101d20c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A tight race for one of North Carolina's Senate seats is turning into a veritable battle of the sexes, with a huge and growing gulf between male and female voters.A new Suffolk University/USA Today poll shows that Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) is leading her challenger, State House Speaker Thom Tillis (R), by 18 points among women voters. But Tillis leads by 14 points among men, adding up to a whopping 32-point gender gap in the race -- significantly wider than the 20-point gender gap that launched President Barack Obama to victory in 2012. Overall, Hagan leads Tillis by only two percentage points, 45 percent to 43 percent. But Hagan leads among women voters by a margin of 52 to 34 percent, while Tillis leads among men by 52 to 38 percent. Women voters outnumber men in North Carolina by about 500,000, so Hagan's re-election chances could hinge on whether those women turn out to vote. Democrats are pinning their hopes for control of the Senate on women candidates and women voters. EMILY's List, a well-funded political action committee that boosts women candidates who support abortion rights, is spending millions to turn out women for Hagan, New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D), Kentucky Democratic Senate nominee Allison Lundergan Grimes and Georgia Democratic Senate nominee Michelle Nunn.The group is spending $3 million on Hagan's race alone, and recently launched an ad highlighting Tillis' efforts to kill equal-pay legislation as state House speaker.EMILY's List has also hit Tillis on his cuts to education funding and pointed out the contrast between the two candidates on abortion rights. Hagan supports the right to a legal abortion, while Tillis believes abortion should be banned except in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. Tillis said he favors a measure that would give fetuses legal personhood rights and supported a controversial anti-abortion amendment in the state Senate that was oddly attached to a motorcycle safety bill. ""Thom Thillis has built his political career by targeting women and families - it's no wonder the women of North Carolina are rejecting him,"" said Marcy Stech, EMILY's List spokeswoman. ""They are looking for a leader who respects them, not someone who prioritizes killing equal pay legislation, blocking access to women's health care and cutting education funding. Tillis is among the worst offenders when it comes to the issues that matter to women – and the gender gap shows North Carolina women know it.”In hopes of narrowing the gender gap, Tillis is deploying his wife to boost support from Republican women. Susan Tillis visited five cities throughout the state this week with Republican National Committee co-chair Sharon Day as part of the RNC's 14 in '14 initiative to engage women voters.""I was thrilled to work with so many wonderful ladies this week through the 14 in '14 Initiative, as there are so many critical issues at the center of this election,"" Susan Tillis said in a statement. ""It's clear the Republican Party is the way for women in North Carolina."""
11,BUSINESS,Sears Just Admitted Its Terrible Sales Are Unacceptable,Jillian Berman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sears-sales_n_5697627.html,,2014-08-21,"TORONTO, ON - MAY 14: Sears is considering selling its Canadian operations as the retailer continues with efforts to turn around its business. Photographed at Sears' Rexdale store in the Woodbine Centre. May 14, 2014. (Keith Beaty/Toronto Star via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb312152500009400389f48.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The demise of one of America's iconic retailers isn't slowing down.Sears Holdings, the parent company of Sears and Kmart, announced Thursday that it lost $573 million over the last three months -- the company’s 9th straight quarterly loss. Sales at stores open more than a year, an important measure of retail health, increased 0.1 percent at Sears and dropped 1.7 percent at Kmart. On a conference call with analysts Thursday, executives blamed the poor sales performance on a variety of factors, including a lagging electronics business at Sears, poor grocery and household sales at Kmart and too many promotions. ""Our second quarter earnings are unacceptable, and we are taking steps to address our performance on several levels,"" the company's CEO, Edward Lampert, said in a statement Thursday. Sears has been struggling for some time to shed underperforming assets and revamp its dowdy image to drive sales. Sears is currently in the midst of a dramatic turnaround effort, spearheaded by Lampert, a hedge fund billionaire. The company spun off Lands End earlier this year and is weighing divesting from Sears Canada. Sears has also shuttered about 300 stores since 2010, according to Reuters. The company announced earlier this year that it planned to close 130 more in 2014. Rob Schriesheim, Sears’ chief financial officer, said in Thursday's release that the company may go beyond that 130 number.In addition to the store closures, Lampert highlighted a number of other of transformation initiatives on the call. The company is focusing on boosting its digital business, shifting the mix of promotions so it's more focused on the company’s “Shop Your Way” rewards program, leasing out unproductive space and working on the supply chain to make sure the stores have the right mix of products, he said. Sears workers told The Huffington Post that it's discouraging to see the company's financials in such bad shape. One Sears associate who works at a store in California, who spoke on condition he not be named for fear of retaliation from his employer, said the morale at his store is low, as ground-level workers are constantly pushed to hit quotas.""The general consensus is that Sears is a sinking ship, and we, the associates, are in the engine room bailing out water,"" said the associate.For its part, Sears says people should be patient with the company's transformation, as the retailer aims to move from just selling products in traditional stores to serving customers wherever and however they want to shop. ""Change of this scale is not always easy,"" Sears spokesman Howard Riefs wrote in an emailed statement to HuffPost. ""But, we’re investing heavily in our future and we’d ask those watching to stay tuned.""Still, the store's efforts to fix things might not be enough to turn the retail giant around. Lampert, who was responsible for the Sears-Kmart merger in 2005, has been criticized for not investing enough money in the business and focusing too much on cutting things out instead. At the same time, Sears and Kmart are facing competition from traditional rivals like Home Depot, Walmart and Target, as well as online retailers like Amazon. The company is also plagued by the same challenges facing other retailers. Slow wage growth has meant low- and middle-income Americans just don’t have enough money to spend at places like Sears and Kmart. More people are turning to dollar stores, which offer discounts in urban locations that don’t require a car and gas to get to a suburban mall. -- Kim Bhasin contributed to this report. "
