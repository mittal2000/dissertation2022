Yahoo is renovating the main entry into its website in an effort to get people to visit more frequently and linger for longer periods of time. The long-awaited makeover of Yahoo.com's home page is the most notable change to the website since the Internet company hired Marissa Mayer as its CEO seven months ago. The new look will start to gradually roll out in the U.S early Wednesday.

Working moms have been particularly vocal about this issue because we are the most impacted by such mandates.I have always been a working mom; however, I have been fortunate enough to have flexibility when it comes to time spent with my children. When my first child was born I was working from home doing sales and marketing for a major financial services company. Since then, I opened my own business just two miles from my home called Kidville Bethesda, an early childhood development facility.Contrary to popular belief, owning a kid's business does not allow me to bring my kids to work every day. In fact, similar to most working moms, the majority of my day is spent outside of the home and away from my kids. The largest advantage I do have, as a mompreneur, is that I have the flexibility to squeeze in ""mom moments"" like taking my sons to the doctor, attending their extracurricular activities and volunteering at their schools. I would be remiss if I did not point out that creating this flexibility does come at a price to a mompreneur -- juggling staff schedules, increasing payroll and sacrificing customer face time. However, I am fortunate enough to be able to make that choice.One of my closest friends is considering going back to work full-time after being a stay-at-home mom for the past five years. Her reservations do not concern the eight-hour work day or even the two hour round trip daily commute; instead, it's not being able to put her daughter on the morning school bus or take her son to swim lessons. These seemingly little mom moments that mean so much to us are what we fear we will miss if we are working eight-hour days with no flexibility.Missing these mom moments can be a deterrent to re-entering or remaining in the corporate work force. In fact, corporate mandates that ban working from home could have the added effect of driving more women towards entrepreneurship. In a recent State of Women-Owned Businesses survey, conducted jointly by NAWBO (National Association of Women Owned Business) and Web.com, 85 percent of women entrepreneurs indicated their belief that more women will start their own businesses in 2013. Entrepreneurship could be the answer for many working moms -- leading to more flexibility to squeeze in those ""mom moments!"""
1,PARENTING,The Pros and Cons of Facebook for Kids,"Babble.com, Contributor
Real parents sharing real moments that help you think, help yo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-pros-and-cons-of-face_us_5b9ce5e8e4b03a1dcc82cb9d,"By the time children reach middle school, the cell phone battle has usually been won or lost -- and these days, kids are the winners. However, the Facebook argument is a lot harder.",2013-03-07,"An unidentified 11-year-old girl logs into Facebook on her iPhone at her home in Palo Alto, Calif., Monday, June 4, 2012. Though Facebook bans children under 13, millions of them have profiles on the site by lying about their age. The company is now testing ways to allow those kids to participate without needing to lie. This would likely be under parental supervision, such as by connecting children's accounts to their parents' accounts. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce5e826000035007fa973.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Written by Monica Villa for Babble.comIf you are a parent in today's world, then you face enormous difficulties in determining what role technology should play in your children's lives. Kids are surrounded by iPods, video games, and Web-enabled devices from a very young age, and even if you manage to keep your own house reasonably tech-free, you are going to hear a lot of those ""but-everyone-else-has-one"" arguments. And then there is Facebook.By the time children reach middle school, the cell phone battle has usually been won or lost -- and these days, kids are the winners. However, the Facebook argument is a lot harder. On the one hand, Facebook's own rules state that no one under the age of 13 is allowed to have an account. In fact, opening an account for anyone younger than 13 effectively means lying about their age. However, this doesn't seem to have stopped thousands of kids from doing just that -- with or without their parents consent.Related: 12 reasons not to friend your babysitter on Facebook In many cases, parents allow Facebook accounts at an earlier age because they see an opportunity to teach their child first-hand about the right way -- and the wrong way -- to use social networking. That's an opportunity that might not be there once they hit the magic age of 13 and dive into Facebook on their own. Other parents allow it on the condition that they hold the password and are friends with their child -- an arrangement they hope will last well into their teens.If you are trying to make a decision on what's right for your child, here's a reminder of some of the advantages -- and disadvantages -- of an early Facebook account:ADVANTAGES:1. Social skills Facebook allows kids to keep up with current friends and make new ones. When used in the right way, social media can increase a child's self-esteem and help them feel less isolated.2. Self-expression A Facebook page gives a child her own ""home page"" on the web, where she can express herself and talk about her interests. She can join groups and support fan pages, and find out what other people are interested in.3. Digital competence Managing a Facebook page teaches a child how to post comments and photos, and how to navigate the Web. Having good online social media skills will be increasingly important as they get older.4. Educational development A majority of tweens and teens use social networking to discuss school work. Shared discussions about school assignments is one of the best reasons to allow access to social networks.DISADVANTAGES:1. Kids can be mean However much you school your child on the right way to behave online, you cannot stop other children from posting mean comments.2. A Facebook account is a gateway to the whole Internet It's impossible to isolate a Facebook account from the rest of the Internet -- links and click-through ads are everywhere. If you think your child is too young to explore the Internet or cannot be trusted to remain within the Facebook environment, then a Facebook account is a bad idea.3. Beware of friends of friends Often times it's not your child's friends who are the problem, it's friends of friends. When your child accepts a friend request, make sure you check out their page and their list of friends. (If you are friends with your child, you need to be careful with your page too!)Whatever your decision on Facebook, try and make the decision together. If you decide the time isn't right, then agree a time when you can revisit the issue. The last thing you want is for your child to run off to a friend's house and open an account on her own.For the 10 rules of Facebook etiquette every kid should know, visit Babble!MORE ON BABBLE: 11 mistakes all parents make (even the perfect ones!) 10 things I did as a child that kids today would NEVER do The 10 biggest secrets parents hide from their kids 25 things every kid should experience"

3,FOOD & DRINK,Ruth Reichl: Fine Dining Is Coming Back In Style,Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ruth-reichl-fine-dining_us_5b9ce728e4b03a1dcc82d6d1,This prediction defies traditional wisdom about the younger diners of today.,2013-03-07,"NEW YORK - APRIL 07: Editor-in-Chief Gourmet Magazine Ruth Reichl attends the 2008 Matrix Award at the Waldorf Astoria on April 7, 2008 in New York City. (Photo by Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce7282400003100536158.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In her tenure as a restaurant critic at the New York Times, Ruth Reichl was notorious for lavishing praise on dingy restaurants with great food. Her rapturous reviews of downscale Asian joints like New York Noodletown helped convince the world that white tablecloths and fresh peonies weren't prerequisites for culinary merit. She played a key part in the great culinary coup de grace of our time: the fall of staid haute cuisine institutions like Lutece and Le Bec Fin and the rise of casual eateries like Mission Chinese and Baco Mercat. But in a recent interview with Russ Parsons of the Los Angeles Times, Reichl predicts that fine dining is headed for a comeback, and that the young diners who have led the charge away from ivory candles and tuxedoed waiters will be in the vanguard of the counter-revolution.""Those places they're eating now aren’t cheap,"" Reichl told Parsons. ""I predict you’re going to start seeing -- not this year or next year, but within five years -- the comeback of the formal dining experience. They’re going to want to go out and get more for their money than just another place you can get good food and shout at each other.""This prediction defies traditional wisdom about today's younger diners -- that they like to keep things casual. A Boston Consulting Group study on millennial consumption habits released in November, for example, noted that diners between the ages of 18 and 34 are more likely than others to order takeout and to visit restaurants during off-peak hours. To judge by analyses like these, the restaurants of the future are more likely to be 24-hour-delivery pork bun shops than reincarnations of La Caravelle. But another, less often noted feature of today's 20- and 30-somethings is their respect for traditional aesthetics. Young people now, much more so than the young people of the 1960s, '70s and '80s, love old, pretty, refined things. This veneration is at the heart of the revival of pre-Prohibition cocktails and the popularity of ""Downton Abbey."" Dinner at a fancy restaurant (unlike, say, $14 Corpse Revivers) still costs enough that it remains out of reach for most people under the age of 34. But as millenials age and come into more disposable income, their conservative tastes could conflict with their relaxed dining habits. Maybe the the Reichl Prophecy will prove true -- or maybe the clash will breed a new kind of restaurant for a new kind of diner."
