0,POLITICS,"'Let's Drag Veterans Into Our Gross Spectacle,' Said Some GOP Candidates",Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-iowa-debate-veterans_us_56aa529ee4b0016489229fc7,"You know, like classy people do!",2016-01-28,Donating money to combat veterans: the super-easy guide for idiots.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56aa57e01f00007f00216d78.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You may have heard that reality teevee mogul Donald Trump has opted to pull out of Thursday's Republican debate on the grounds that Megyn Kelly was mean to him one time (i.e., asked him a question). Instead of joining the rest of the field on the Fox News debate stage, Trump plans to hold what he's called a ""Special Event To Benefit Veterans Organizations."" Lest you think there is actual altruism behind this move, rest assured that Trump has specifically positioned the event as a spite-driven harrumph intended to hurt Fox News' ratings, with military veterans serving as props.It's pretty saddening to see veterans caught up in the middle of this primary's stupendous nonsense. Nevertheless, this is a great opportunity for Trump's opponents to differentiate themselves from the frivolous hooligan in their midst, by rediscovering a little statesmanship and reasserting a little seriousness.As you might expect, this is not what's happening. Days before the Iowa caucus, combat vets are being treated as poker chips in a daffy game of Texas Hold 'em, and Trump's main competitor is going all in. As The Hill's Bradford Richardson reports:Super PACs supporting Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz say they will donate $1.5 million to charities committed to helping veterans if rival Donald Trump agrees to a one-on-one debate with Cruz.Phew! At last, we finally have a ""terrific opportunity"" to support veterans. Man, I was wondering when one of those would come along! All it took was for Cruz to decide to do what he does best: a little opportunistic grandstanding.As Richardson reports, Cruz's super PAC's came out with the cash offer very soon after Cruz himself announced that he'd gone and booked a venue for this one-off debate. So the added fun of this is that everyone gets to watch political reporters sort of shrug and hedge at an obvious example of a campaign coordinating with its own super PAC. This is, of course, technically illegal, but it hardly matters when everyone's decided to bury their heads in the sand and pretend that nothing is happening. I guess you'd have to be a real heel to point out that this whole arrangement looks awfully corrupt when there are potential veterans' benefits on the line.If you thought all this conditional patriotism couldn't get any crasser, think again, because also-ran former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina is still skulking around in the root cellar. Over the past few days, Fiorina has injected herself into this to-do with this series of tweets:Right, so what you just witnessed was Carly Fiorina staking $3.5 million to buy her way into either the televised Fox debate (which has shut her out because her polling numbers have dropped so low that she's now surplus to requirements) or Trump's competing event. Pretty classy thing to do -- flaunt a thick bankroll, try to extort your way into the sanctioned debate from which you've been barred by promising the cash to a good cause, and if that fails, use a bigger bankroll to extort your way into Trump's umbrage-fest.Pretending that all of this is some act of courage is an additional nasty touch on Fiorina's part. But it's all good, right? It's like a reality TV show where some wounded combat veterans might get better health care if everyone properly debases themselves.Since there seems to be a lot of confusion, let's use the Eat The Press telestrator to draw up a flowchart explaining what everyone with a functioning soul is supposed to do in this situation.  And that settles that."

Monday's decision split the court 6-3, with Kennedy writing for the majority and Scalia for the dissenters.What the decision means in practice is that potentially thousands of lifers -- adults who were sentenced to die in prison for crimes they committed as kids -- may be granted hearings at which they can argue they should receive mercy. Scalia wasn't happy with the ruling, as he hasn't been in other cases where the court has shown a little leniency to certain classes of offenders. To explain his beef, he gave Kennedy a history lesson -- along with his usual sarcasm and snide commentary.First, he went back to the 2012 decision, Miller v. Alabama, which prohibits sentences of life without the possibility of parole for ""all but the rarest of children, those whose crimes reflect irreparable corruption.""In that ruling, Scalia said, the Supreme Court had bent over backward to restrict the states as little as possible.He quoted directly from Miller: ""Our decision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime. Instead, it mandates only that a sentencer follow a certain process -- considering an offender's youth and attendant characteristics -- before imposing a particular penalty.""In other words, Scalia said, all the 2012 decision did was tell states that they must guarantee youthful defendants a procedure at the time of trial in which they might be granted a chance for future release. Nothing more, nothing less.But Scalia said that Kennedy's opinion in the new case dances around this clear language in an effort to make Miller apply retroactively. In so doing, Scalia charged, the court goes beyond the original decision, ""rewriting"" it in such a way that it now imposes a heavy burden on states.""How wonderful,"" he mused, before contending that courts now face the ""knotty legal question"" of how to go back in time with every single once-youthful offender who's now serving life, to consider re-sentencing them to a less punitive term -- all while weighing whether the inmate was incorrigible at the time of the crime. (Henry Montgomery, the man at the center of the case, was sentenced nearly 50 years ago.)""What silliness,"" Scalia said, deriding the new regime as ""a practical impossibility.""Of course, Kennedy's majority opinion offered a way to deal with the impracticalities -- by granting parole hearings in which the board may focus on who the inmates are now, not who they were as teenagers. That kind of micromanagement really set off Scalia, for here he saw an agenda at work.""This whole exercise, this whole distortion of Miller, is just a devious way of eliminating life without parole for juvenile offenders,"" he declared.Then came the coup de gr√¢ce.Scalia pointed Kennedy to the latter's own majority opinion in the landmark Roper v. Simmons, which held in 2005 that sentencing juveniles to the death penalty is unconstitutional. In that case, Kennedy wrote that life without parole remained a severe enough alternative for those youths the state could no longer kill.""How could the majority -- in an opinion written by the very author of Roper -- now say that punishment is also unconstitutional?"" Scalia wondered, essentially accusing Kennedy of flip-flopping on life without parole.""And then, in Godfather fashion,"" Scalia continued, ""the majority makes state legislatures an offer they can't refuse: Avoid all the utterly impossible nonsense we have prescribed by simply permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole.""Not that Scalia never flip-flops himself. But he has a point here: Sending all those lifers to the parole board sounds much easier than trying to conduct proper re-sentencing hearings in so many old cases.Plus, it is anyone's guess what lower courts will do with the Supreme Court's new ""permanent incorrigibility"" requirement for sentencing youth to die in prison. It sounds like a high standard, one that will likely lead to heaps of litigation over which youthful offenders should or shouldn't face life without parole. (Which, it should be noted, remains constitutional.)If discouraging life without parole was the majority's intent all along, then Scalia's closing words could well reverberate: ""Mission accomplished.""

The ""O'Reilly Factor"" host was trying to convince the GOP frontrunner to join Thursday night's debate in Iowa despite his dislike for Megyn Kelly, the Fox News host who will be one of the event's moderators.O'Reilly even tried appealing to Trump's Christian faith, something the candidate has spoken of frequently in an effort to woo evangelical voters.""In your Christian faith, there is a very significant tenet and that's the tenet of forgiveness,"" O'Reilly said. ""I think you should be the bigger man,"" O'Reilly added. ""Don't you think that's the right thing to do?""""It probably is,"" Trump agreed. ""But y'know it's called an eye for an eye.

O'Reilly physically turned his cheek and patted himself to show what he meant: Trump brushed off the appeal to his faith and instead plugged his event Thursday night for the Wounded Warrior Project, which he will be doing instead of participating in the GOP debate. Trump has been hurling insults at Kelly since the first Fox News debate, when she asked about his history of making sexist comments, and he didn't let up during the O'Reilly interview. ""I have zero respect for Megyn Kelly, I don't think she's very good at what she does, I think she's highly overrated,"" Trump said. He also continued the attacks on Twitter: On Tuesday, Fox News accused Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski of threatening Kelly as he lobbied to have her removed from the debate. ""In a call on Saturday with a Fox News executive, Lewandowski stated that Megyn 'had a rough couple days after that last debate' and he 'would hate to have her go through that again,'"" the network said in a statement. Fox said Kelly would remain a moderator.""We can't give into terrorizations toward any of our employees,"" the network said.Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"
4,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders And Hillary Clinton Are Actually Fighting About Barack Obama,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-sanders-obama_us_56aa378de4b05e4e3703753a,It's a debate over what Obama accomplished -- and what he didn't.,2016-01-28,The debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders has been simmering on the left for most of the Obama presidency.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56aa38a31f00005000216d11.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The debate Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are having in the Democratic presidential campaign is in many ways about the future. It's about their different theories of political change, and about how to get shit done. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, is unabashedly ambitious. As president, he‚Äôd try to stretch the boundaries of the politically possible, rallying grassroots support to force sweeping liberal initiatives through Congress. Clinton, the former secretary of state, is part of the political establishment and lives by its conventions. If elected, she would slog her way through the usual political muck, hoping to realize a progressive vision through a series of hard-fought, incremental victories.But lurking behind this argument about the future is a dispute that's really about the past. It‚Äôs a debate over what Obama accomplished in office -- in particular, how significant those accomplishments really are. And it's been simmering on the left for most of the last seven years.On one side of this divide are activists and intellectuals who are ambivalent, disappointed or flat-out frustrated with what Obama has gotten done. They acknowledge what they consider modest achievements -- like helping some of the uninsured and preventing the Great Recession from becoming another Great Depression. But they are convinced that the president could have accomplished much more if only he‚Äôd fought harder for his agenda and been less quick to compromise. They dwell on the opportunities missed, like the lack of a public option in health care reform or the failure to break up the big banks. They want those things now -- and more. In Sanders, they are hearing a candidate who thinks the same way. On the other side are partisans and thinkers who consider Obama's achievements substantial, even historic. They acknowledge that his victories were partial and his legislation flawed. This group recognizes that there are still millions of people struggling to find good jobs or pay their medical bills, and that the planet is still on a path to catastrophically high temperatures. But they see in the last seven years major advances in the liberal crusade to bolster economic security for the poor and middle class. They think the progress on climate change is real, and likely to beget more in the future.Their priority in this election is choosing a president focused not just on advancing this agenda where possible, but also on defending the Obama legacy from Republican assault. And that‚Äôs what Clinton is promising them.The distinction is subtle, but it's there once you start looking. Check out the Sanders campaign website, and you‚Äôll find a collection of serious papers on domestic policy issues, laying out comprehensive and frequently audacious plans. But many mention Obama and his legacy only in passing, or not at all. One exception is a page on health care, which dutifully recounts the achievements of the Affordable Care Act. Then it quickly brushes past that to focus on the problems of the remaining uninsured and those with coverage who face staggering premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The health care page doesn‚Äôt mention resisting GOP efforts to repeal the law, just as a page on climate says nothing about blocking Republican attempts to roll back the new Environmental Protection Agency regulations on emissions. Clinton‚Äôs website is very different. On the health care page, she vows to ‚Äúdefend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) against Republican efforts to repeal it‚Äù before sketching out her own, more limited ideas for reform. On her climate page, she vows that protecting existing regulations will be a ‚Äútop priority.‚Äù The statements are consistent with the rhetoric of her new Iowa ad, which -- as columnist Jonathan Chait noted recently in New York magazine -- promises to ‚Äústop the Republicans from ripping all our progress away‚Äù while clips of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz play on the screen. You'll see nothing like that in the Sanders Iowa spots, which focus on his sweeping plans for the economy and health care -- or show images of his energetic, idealistic supporters set against a Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack.The contrast between Sanders and Clinton was also apparent on Monday evening, when the two candidates made separate appearances at a CNN town hall in Des Moines, Iowa. Sanders answered an early question about his agenda by focusing on all the problems that America faces -- stagnant wages, unaffordable health care, too much power on Wall Street -- and calling for a political revolution to address them. ‚ÄúThis is not what America is supposed to be about,‚Äù Sanders said. ‚ÄúEstablishment politics is not good enough. We need bold changes.‚ÄùIt was a version of Sanders‚Äô stump speech, and it was a stark contrast to Clinton. Reprising one of her own favorite lines, the former secretary of state talked about continuing the ‚Äúprogress we had under President Obama‚Äù and her commitment ‚Äúto do everything we possibly can not to let the Republicans rip it away and turn us backwards.‚ÄùTo be clear, these differences of emphasis belie the relatively similar views that Sanders and Clinton have when it comes to what America should really look like. Both are committed progressives. Both want government playing an active role in guaranteeing economic security, setting rules for the economy, protecting traditional victims of discrimination and preserving the environment. Both think Obama advanced this agenda, but that there is still more to do.As for their differences over strategy and tactics, they might not even matter much if either becomes president. Republicans are likely to control at least one house of Congress for the next four years, severely limiting the opportunities to pass ambitious legislation. If a Democratic president succeeds Obama, he or she will spend much of the next four years stopping a lot of GOP-backed legislation from becoming law. Both Sanders and Clinton would perform that task energetically.But their different attitudes towards the Obama era could still have political significance. Supporters of Sanders would argue -- and Sanders presumably believes -- that his pitch better fits the mood of the electorate, given that polls consistently show majorities of Americans believe the country is on the ‚Äúwrong track‚Äù and large numbers of people really are struggling with stagnant wages and high medical bills. Running so heavily on the Obama record sure makes less sense when that record doesn't excite the public.In this view, voters within and outside the Democratic Party are craving a radical change, something more sweeping and transformative than anything Obama achieved. And while enacting such an agenda may not be politically possible in the next two years, Sanders can use the inevitable Republican resistance to rally the public behind Democrats in the 2018 midterms -- a point a top Sanders adviser made to The Huffington Post's Sam Stein earlier this week. In the meantime, Sanders supporters, he will be generating support for a much more liberal agenda, and setting the terms of debate in a way that pushes legislative compromises further to the left. It's not a crazy argument.But ignoring or denying the progress of the Obama era also carries risks, as Clinton supporters point out. Republican politicians and their allies in the conservative movement speak in one consistent voice, arguing that the Obama agenda has been not just a failure, but a catastrophe. Absent a strong defense of these programs, average voters may listen and conclude that his programs must not have done much good. In the long run, that can undermine the public‚Äôs faith in government activism of any kind. It can also set up liberals for a perpetual cycle of disappointment, as they discover over and over again that the compromised progressive reforms coming out of Washington don‚Äôt match their lofty expectations.Of course, ambivalence towards Obama-era achievements can have a more immediate effect, too. They can make those programs politically vulnerable, to the point where Republicans have not just the institutional power but also the political cover to dismantle them. If that happens -- if millions of people lose health insurance, if progress on climate change halts or reverses -- the progressives underwhelmed by the last seven years might decide they made a big difference after all."
5,SCIENCE,Shielding Students From Stereotypes Helps Way More Than We Thought,Jacqueline Howard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stereotypes-classroom-learning_us_56a90de7e4b0947efb664677,"Focusing on just a few can impact an entire classroom, a new study shows.",2016-01-28,"Helping just a few students combat ""stereotype threat"" benefits <em>everyone's</em> academic performance in a classroom, new research shows.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a990441f00005000216ce2.jpeg?cache=oDjVKFqLCm&ops=crop_0_155_3869_2424%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"We all know that negative stereotypes exist and that as a result, people may be discriminated against or denied access to resources without justification.But there's another disturbing effect that often goes unnoticed. It turns out that ""stereotype threat,"" or simply knowing that others view you as a negative stereotype, may impair your academic performance.Scientists have long known about psychological exercises that can reduce the effects of ""stereotype threat,"" but now it seems that such exercises not only benefit those experiencing this, but also the people around them.New research suggests that when students who are vulnerable to being stereotyped complete exercises that cause them to reflect on their own personal values, they perform better in class -- and so do other students around them, even if those other students don't complete the self-reflection tasks themselves.It's unclear how an entire classroom can benefit from just a few students taking moments to self-reflect, but the researchers are excited to further study this question, Joseph Powers, a psychological scientist at Stanford University and lead author of the research, told The Huffington Post.He said it's possible that the other students in the classroom felt motivated to perform better when they saw that their classmates' grades improved. Or perhaps the improvement in grades of some students allowed teachers to focus more time on other students who needed more attention to learn.""This research suggests that psychological processes go beyond the individual,"" Powers said. ""Protecting people from negative stereotype threats benefits them, and these less threatened people benefit their entire group. As a field concerned with social change we could gain a lot by considering these collective effects when we measure the impact of experiments and social programs.""The researchers analyzed data from two previous studies conducted on 550 seventh-graders, in which the students were asked to complete a 15-minute writing assignment about their personal values -- unaware that this was part of a study, Powers said. Meanwhile, a control group of students wrote about neutral topics.About 40 percent of the students were black, 40 percent white and 20 percent of other ethnicities. ""This kind of personal reflection can broaden and protect a person's identity during difficult transitions, such as the start of seventh grade,"" Powers said. ""Affirming core values has been shown to protect students from some of the negative effects of stereotype threat and improve students' sense of social belonging and academic performance.""The researchers found that individual student grades improved just from being in a class with a greater proportion of African-American students who completed the self-reflection task. This improvement appeared to be especially strong for low-performing students of all ethnicities.The researchers' analysis showed that adding just two or more black students who completed the self-reflection task to a classroom resulted in low-performing students' grades to increase on average by a third of a letter grade, so from a C to a C+.""We were surprised that the effect of sharing a classroom with more affirmed students was almost as large as the effect of receiving a values affirmation,"" Powers said. ""Who would have thought that the indirect benefits of an intervention could be almost as large than the direct benefits?""It seems that while stereotypes can negatively impact an entire society, protecting individuals from stereotypes can positively impact society at large.The research was published last month in the journal Psychological Science.Also on HuffPost:"

That might scare some people. Because my skill set isn't like anybody else.""Cowherd, however, claims that the ‚Äúpushback‚Äù Newton has received ‚Äúain‚Äôt a black thing‚Äù -- but rather comes back to this question of being ""humble,"" or, in a regrettable choice of words, ""act[ing] like"" a ""servant.""While it‚Äôs important to note that Cowherd himself is not endorsing these criticisms of Newton -- he‚Äôs actually praised Newton quite a bit in the last few years -- any comparison to the wildly controversial Trump is bound to turn some heads and ruffle some feathers.And as Newton tends to spend his spare time volunteering and helping the community, while Trump has spent his last half-year spreading fear-mongering, divisive messages, we‚Äôre going to concentrate on the pair‚Äôs differences rather than the one or two similarities they may appear to share.

He shared many deliciously cute photos during that time.Apparently, Facebook did just fine while its leader was away. On Wednesday, the social network announced that its revenue had grown by an astonishing 52 percent over the three-month period ending Dec. 31 -- profits for that quarter were more than $1 BILLION. Zuckerberg was out on leave for about one-third of that time.The price of Facebook stock spiked on the earnings news, delivering Zuck an additional $5.5 billion and moving him up to rank sixth on the list of the wealthiest people on the planet, Bloomberg reports. Nice payout for all that snuggle time.So, for you high-powered dads-to-be out there stressed about walking away from your job for a little while to take leave... take heart! You can leave work behind and things are probably going to be OK.This is a particularly important message for men to hear, since they are less likely to take parental leave -- even when it's offered. There's still a stigma around the whole concept, and in some workplaces, dads do find themselves penalized for taking time off.Even at Facebook, where an enlightened leader is setting himself up as a role model, most of the guys do not fully avail themselves of the company's leave policy.Facebook offers four months of leave to all parents. Zuckerberg took two months, an unprecedented amount of time for a chief executive running a multibillion-dollar company.By comparison, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer took just two weeks of leave in 2012 after she delivered her first baby and ""limited"" time off after she had twins this past December.The bummer is that most people don't have the luxury of choosing how much parental leave to take. The United States is the only developed country in the world that doesn't mandate paid time off for new mothers. In many other countries, fathers also get paid leave as a matter of public policy.Facebook and many other tech companies that employ well-educated, well-paid workers do offer fairly generous parental leave. Most companies don't. Only 12 percent of workers in the private sector get paid parental leave.Indeed, the arrival of a new baby can often send women on the lower end of the income scale, with no paid time off, spiraling down into poverty for a spell.Women with no paid leave often must return to work quickly after having a child, leading to higher rates of depression for those new mothers -- and often devastating consequences for their children.Back to Zuckerberg's leave payout. The plan is to give away the money. In December, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced they would be giving 99 percent of their Facebook stock to form a philanthropic venture called the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. "
8,SCIENCE,Scientists Take Major Step Toward Understanding Schizophrenia,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/schizophrenia-discovery_us_56a918c7e4b0947efb66548f,A breakthrough discovery sheds light on the genetic basis of the devastating disease.,2016-01-28,Scientists have taken one more step toward understanding the biology of schizophrenia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a91cf91f00005000216c8c.jpeg?ops=crop_0_90_2107_1338%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A landmark new study sheds some light on how certain genes may influence the development of schizophrenia, a complex psychiatric condition that scientists have long struggled to make sense of and to treat. The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, point toward possible causes underlying the psychiatric disorder that affects roughly 3.5 million Americans, or about 1 percent of the general population. Schizophrenia is characterized by symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, cognitive difficulties and abnormal social behavior.Psychiatrists know little, however, about its origins and biological underpinnings.""The fundamental scientific predicament in schizophrenia and in all mental illness is that we haven't known even the most basic things about how these diseases start,"" Dr. Steve McCarroll, a geneticist at Harvard University and one of the study's authors, told The Huffington Post. ""Any steps toward understanding the root causes of the disease is potentially really helpful."" For the new study, researchers from across the U.S. collaborated to investigate how genetics influence an individual's chance of developing the disease, isolating one particular gene that seems to drive that risk. They found that people who carry a gene that speeds up or strengthens the normal developmental process of ""synaptic pruning"" in the brain are at a higher risk for developing schizophrenia. Typically, the brain uses this process to shed weak or unneeded neural connections as it matures. This happens primarily during adolescence and young adulthood, and is concentrated in the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which is associated with high-level thinking, planning and decision-making. But in people with schizophrenia, the synaptic pruning process goes into overdrive. This may explain why those individuals have been shown to have fewer neural connections in their prefrontal cortex, and why the disorder almost always shows up during adolescence or young adulthood. ""The great majority of schizophrenia cases present between the ages of 16 and 25, which has always been one of the mysteries of the illness,"" McCarroll said. ""Why would it strike at this particular time in life?"" The researchers found that the gene associated with aggressive tagging of weak neural connections -- meaning that more of these connections are eaten away by proteins than they are in a healthy brain -- also carries the protein C4. The C4 protein tells another protein to attach to synapses, or neural connectors, in the brain.""C4 is essentially placing the Post-it note on synapses that says 'eat me,'"" McCarroll said. While the findings are preliminary, scientists say they represent a step in the right direction.""This paper gives us a foothold, something we can work on, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been looking for now, for a long, long time,"" Dr. David Goldstein, a professor of genetics at Columbia University who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times. The new findings hopefully will one day pave the way for more effective treatments and screening protocols for the disease, such as a test or drug that could target runaway synaptic pruning. ""Drugs today don't treat schizophrenia -- they treat a single symptom of schizophrenia, which is psychosis,"" McCarroll said. ""They don't treat the cognitive decline and the emotional withdrawal that patients endure, because they don't address the root causes. And the reason is that we haven't figured out very basic things about what those root causes are.""More research needs to be done to confirm the findings, as well as to devise new treatment options.""We're going to work very hard to try to understand what exactly is changing in the adolescent brain at this particular time of life,"" McCarroll said. ""We think it's incredibly important to understand the biological changes that are taking place during the period of adolescence that establishes human vulnerability to this illness.""Also on HuffPost: "

11,POLITICS,Why Some Atheists Say Bernie Sanders Gets Them When He Talks About Religion,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-atheists_us_56a92863e4b0947efb666ccc,"Except for that whole ""God"" thing.",2016-01-28,"Sanders recently told The Washington Post that to him, believing in God ""means that all of us are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together.‚Äù",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a9ac4f2a00006e000316bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you ask Bernie Sanders if he believes in God, he'll tell you he does.""Yeah, I do. I do,"" the independent senator from Vermont told Rolling Stone in response to that question last year, before going on to say that he was not involved in organized religion.But when Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist raised by Jewish parents in New York, explains exactly what that means, it becomes clear that his views set him apart from the rest of the presidential field. So much so that some nonbelievers feel the Democratic candidate adheres to principles that are as secular as they are religious, if not more so.The question of whether someone believes in God leaves little room for ambiguity, and in a nation that still tends to revere religious devotion and recoil at godlessness, every major presidential candidate has answered it in the affirmative. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has gone further, speaking recently about her Methodist upbringing and relationship with Jesus Christ. Some Republican candidates have seemingly done everything short of speaking in tongues and tapping the Son of God as their running mate.But amid remarks that otherwise center around faith in biblical teachings and traditional understandings of spirituality or a supernatural God, Sanders has spoken about belief in his own way.To Sanders, believing in God ""means that all of us are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together,‚Äù he said in an interview with The Washington Post published Wednesday.""I believe that what impacts you impacts me, that we are all united in one way or another,"" Sanders told Rolling Stone last year. ""When children go hungry, I get impacted. When kids die because they can't afford medicine, I get impacted. We are one world and one people. And that belief leads me to the conclusion that we just cannot turn our back on human suffering.""Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the Center for Freethought Equality, a political action committee working to increase representation for nonbelievers, says Sanders' rhetoric reflects a worldview consistent with secular humanism, a philosophy that bases decision-making and morality on reason, science and a code of ethics grounded in a shared humanity and the capacity for empathy.And while Speckhardt doesn't think the senator is being untruthful about his belief in God, he says many atheists have recognized parallels in the way Sanders discusses it.""Sanders defines God in a very different way than the way most Americans do, and in fact, a way that would be compatible with nontheistic humanists,"" Speckhardt said.""His reliance is on humanity, his reliance is on what we can do together,"" Speckhardt continued. ""He sees God as in everything, much in the same way that we look at nature and our surroundings and our efforts that we've achieved through science as something that's almost divine in its being worthy of recognition. This isn't any kind of supernatural God. I haven't heard Sanders say anything that sounded supernatural to me. And that's something that's very different from how most Americans view the concept of God.""Paul Fidalgo, communications director of the Center for Inquiry, a nonprofit devoted to promoting free thought and humanism, has similarly been encouraged not just by Sanders' remarks, but by his commitment to science and reason.""The idea that when we decide to see all people as being in the same boat, and we decide that everyone else's well-being matters to us and that it affects us, those are definitely humanistic principles,"" he said. ""For secular humanists and even just what you would call the 'nones' -- the unaffiliated -- acceptance and advocacy of reality is key.""While nonbelievers may find plenty of common ground with Sanders when he talks about his beliefs, they don't appear to agree on how to describe them. Sanders maintains that they're rooted in God. His campaign didn't respond to a request for comment on his position on humanism.But it's easy to see why a presidential candidate would be wary of how the public views his or her faith. Atheism remains among the most toxic brands in U.S. politics, even as the number of religiously unaffiliated Americans grows. Though a Pew Research Center survey released this week found that the share of American adults who say they'd be less likely to vote for an atheist candidate is trending downward, 51 percent still say a candidate who doesn't believe in God might lose their support, the largest percentage of any trait polled.Being Muslim was the next most significant political liability, with 42 percent of respondents saying they'd be less likely to vote for a candidate who believes in Islam.Despite the clear disadvantage of atheism, a Gallup poll from last summer managed to find one quality voters found even less appealing: socialism.With those levels of unfavorability, it's perhaps not surprising that there isn't a single openly atheist member of Congress (though there is indeed a socialist senator who's currently running neck and neck with Clinton in early presidential primary states). Almost 92 percent of Congress as a whole is Christian. As are Clinton, Democratic candidate Martin O'Malley and the entire GOP presidential field, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who suggested last year that any candidate who didn't pray each morning would not be fit to serve as president.Atheists are aware of the steep odds they face in politics, and understand that any presidential candidate who has religious views that are out of the norm -- and certainly one who might go as far as to consider him or herself an atheist in private -- might be compelled to finesse discussions of faith. After all, if you wanted to have a real shot at winning a national election, slapping the two most unpopular labels on yourself wouldn't be the easiest way to do it.While neither Speckhardt nor Fidalgo disputed the sincerity of Sanders' comments about God, they both said his approach of focusing on what he does believe, as opposed to what he doesn't, appears to have been largely successful in satisfying supporters on either side of the religion issue.Some nonbelievers even feel that Sanders has demonstrated a growing acceptance of alternate perspectives simply by explaining his relationship with God in such nontraditional terms.""The fact that he's gone this far and he hasn't mimicked that he believes in an almighty, all-powerful God that's making decisions on a daily basis is almost historic right there,"" Speckhardt said. ""It's actually recognition of progress that we're making in showing that you can be good without a God in this country.""But humanists say there's still plenty of work to do. While many see Sanders as both sympathetic to their secular worldview and the candidate most interested in confronting issues important to them, like the separation of church and state, Sanders' own belief in God has led him to make some clumsy comments about faith.""I think everyone believes in God in their own ways,"" Sanders said in his interview with The Washington Post.Glossy platitudes like this have become typical in the hyper-religious arena of national politics, but as Fidalgo points out, it's a blanket statement that casually dismisses nonbelievers. Coming from anyone else, it might be expected. But for the godless Americans who have followed Sanders' career and support his presidential campaign, the words sting more.""I do think it speaks volumes that someone like Bernie Sanders, who is such an outsider candidate, who has gotten to the place he is by being an outlier, by saying the things that other people might be afraid to say because it might not be the right political moment to do it ... would even think to make the calculation that he has to say, 'Everyone believes in a God,'"" said Fidalgo.He added: ""It tells you that there's still a little downward pressure that sits on the political mind that says, 'I can't quite go all the way there.'""Also on HuffPost:"

A water crisis -- the contamination of the population‚Äôs drinking water, and upswing in lead poisoning in children and rashes in adults -- has paralyzed Flint. National Guard Soldiers march on asphalt handing out water bottles to civilians. Freeman is staying in his mother‚Äôs home on Dayton Avenue. Her house, nestled between two blocks of abandoned row homes, has water just as contaminated as everyone else‚Äôs. ‚ÄúHer water was a light yellow.‚Äù Freeman said. ‚Äú[Our reaction] was like, ‚ÄòWhat the fuck. What is going on?‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúAt first you think it‚Äôs nothing, but then it became a major national crisis that we can‚Äôt drink water,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúPeople have to remember this has been going on for two years now. It‚Äôs going to take even longer to fix. This isn‚Äôt going away. It‚Äôs going to take five to 10 years to fix all of this.‚ÄùFlint has always had its issues, he said, but he never would have predicted anywhere in the United States would have drinking water so poisoned it‚Äôs considered hazardous.‚ÄúThis is something straight out of a movie. ... They are giving away water. Water? Who in a million years thought this is something that could be poisoned?‚Äù Freeman told The Huffington Post. ‚ÄúIf you are a Flint resident, these are the problems you have to have. These are the things you see. This is what goes through your mind. It‚Äôs rough.""Freeman, 30, came on the rap scene in 2005. His mother helped him build a studio in their basement when he was 16. In 2013, he signed to Aftermath Entertainment, distributed by Interscope Records, under the tutelage of legendary producer Dr. Dre. He has religiously worn clothing with the words of his city printed on them during appearances.After signing his deal, Freeman moved to California. But last week, he flew back home to help with the crisis on the ground.There is no exact timeline for how long it will take to fix all of Flint‚Äôs issues -- it could be months before the water is safe to drink again, though lead pipes will remain in the ground.It goes deeper than not being able to drink water, Freeman says. Privileges that people have grown used to are now daylong struggles in Buick City.‚ÄúEverything from brushing your teeth and otherwise has become a major inconvenience. I challenge everyone to brush your teeth with a few bottles of water. It‚Äôs daunting,‚Äù Freeman said. ‚ÄúDaily conversations become: ‚ÄòWhere am I taking a shower today?‚Äô We live in the United States and that‚Äôs a common conversation here. All of it is hurtful. All of it shows a lack of compassion and care by those in power.‚ÄùOfficials and water safety experts have said it's safe to shower with Flint's water, though in the past two years residents have complained of rashes, hair loss and skin dryness.Freeman‚Äôs grandparents came to Flint and started a family during the Great Migration of the 20th century, the movement of nearly 6 million black people from the rural Southern United States to the industrial North. The automotive industry was buzzing, and it created opportunities for a growing black community in the Midwestern U.S.  Flint‚Äôs population doubled. In 1978, General Motors employed 80,000 people in Flint. But by 2006, it only stocked jobs for 8,000. When the auto industry fizzled and General Motors‚Äô resources dried up, Flint hit the wall. Unemployment and crime skyrocketed. Freeman said he wouldn‚Äôt point fingers at those in power, but that the water crisis was just one of Flint‚Äôs many issues he‚Äôs been rapping about. What he documented about Flint in his songs were authentic, drugs and guns included, he said. The way Freeman put it in one of his verses captured the city‚Äôs decline: ‚ÄúIn Flint, every day is like a Virginia Tech.‚Äù‚ÄúFlint needed help before the water crisis. There was a breakdown of my city before this. This is level 10 of the problem,‚Äù Freeman said. ‚ÄúWith the automotive industry leaving, that was the first thing. Going to work in the auto industry was like a kid in Flint going to the NBA. When that went away, the feeling of hopelessness seeped in. People felt lost. They didn‚Äôt know what to look forward to. The morale went way down.‚ÄùThe rapper said he didn‚Äôt want to be a part of a hashtag trend -- his assistance to the city is more than just a pop culture nod toward a struggling city facing its newest test. When celebrities aren‚Äôt sending bottled water anymore, Flint will still be poor, progressing and grasping at any glint of hope. ‚ÄúFlint lives matter,"" he said.Also on HuffPost:"
15,SPORTS,Why The Clippers Should Trade Chris Paul,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-clippers-should-trade-chris-paul_us_56a6a1cde4b01a3ed123acd6,The controversial organization must strike while the superstar is still hot.,2016-01-28,"At 30 years old, Paul remains one of the elite two-way players in the NBA.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a91e4d2a00002c00031657.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If the Cavaliers can't win a title with LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love at the helm, then the Clippers certainly can't compete for one with Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and a severely fractured locker room.Perhaps motivated by turning 30 and the dazzling play of his counterpart, Stephen Curry, the 2015-16 version of Paul continues to thrive as a premier point guard. While he hasn't shot it especially well thus far, the perennial First-Team All-NBA selection remains a measuring stick of any floor general, ranking in the top 10 for three crucial categories: player efficiency rating, offensive win shares and box score plus/minus.Ultra willing to distribute the basketball -- his 9.6 assists per game slot him fourth in the league -- Paul remains a phenomenal pick-and-roll operator and is as committed as ever to his patented sticky defense and pesky hands. What owner Steve Ballmer and the Clippers' front office must now decide is if they believe that he and Griffin can co-exist at a top level for the remainder of Paul's five-year, his $107 million contract which ends in 2017 -- when he can enter free agency if he wants -- and if not, whether they can they command top dollar in a trade.Only Curry surpasses Paul's value as a lead guard. He is a legitimate superstar at one of pro basketball's most fungible, yet important positions. And, in the ever-changing style of the modern NBA game, what maybe makes the surefire future Hall of Famer most attractive for a suitor is his capacity to excel in every style of basketball: If you want to play small or big, fast or slow, Paul is elite across the board. The Western Conference, however, is loaded, with Golden State and San Antonio both on pace for historically great seasons and Oklahoma City nipping at their heels. At best -- even with a healthy Griffin -- the 30-16 Clippers are a four seed without home court, tasked with going on the road against either the Warriors or Spurs, neither of whom have lost a single home game this season. And that's a best case scenario. This is a good team, but hardly a threat to the upper echelon of the league, given its inability to maintain a cohesive locker room and patchwork bench.The reality for this franchise is that until the Paul and Griffin era, it was nothing but an afterthought in NBA circles, the ugly step-brother of the Lakers, whose only similarity was that they shared an arena.Before Paul's tenure with the organization, the Clips had reached the playoffs just four times in nearly three decades since the 1984 move to Los Angeles. During his four years, Paul's teams reached the playoffs every season. So compiling 50-win seasons compounded by repeated postseason appearances -- albeit brief ones -- isn't the worst thing in the world. But simply put, the longer it waits to deal Paul, the more the Clippers ultimately risk sinking further in its quest for a first title.A deal now would ensure that whomever acquires the soon-to-be nine-time All-Star would have his services guaranteed for at least the remainder of 2016 and another full season after that. And, more importantly for Ballmer and company, it would allow the team to extract maximum talent in return. ""We‚Äôre all like family,"" Paul told the team's website. ""That's how we're going to deal with this, as a family.""That may be true, but families can break up.

16,SPORTS,Why The Clippers Should Trade Chris Paul,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-clippers-should-trade-chris-paul_us_56a6a1cde4b01a3ed123acd6,The controversial organization must strike while the superstar is still hot.,2016-01-28,"Blake Griffin's recent off-field antics, where he injured his right hand punching a Clippers assistant equipment manager, puts the talented but undermanned team in a precarious position moving forward.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a91f6a1a00002d00ab172d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If the Cavaliers can't win a title with LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love at the helm, then the Clippers certainly can't compete for one with Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and a severely fractured locker room.Perhaps motivated by turning 30 and the dazzling play of his counterpart, Stephen Curry, the 2015-16 version of Paul continues to thrive as a premier point guard. While he hasn't shot it especially well thus far, the perennial First-Team All-NBA selection remains a measuring stick of any floor general, ranking in the top 10 for three crucial categories: player efficiency rating, offensive win shares and box score plus/minus.Ultra willing to distribute the basketball -- his 9.6 assists per game slot him fourth in the league -- Paul remains a phenomenal pick-and-roll operator and is as committed as ever to his patented sticky defense and pesky hands. What owner Steve Ballmer and the Clippers' front office must now decide is if they believe that he and Griffin can co-exist at a top level for the remainder of Paul's five-year, his $107 million contract which ends in 2017 -- when he can enter free agency if he wants -- and if not, whether they can they command top dollar in a trade.Only Curry surpasses Paul's value as a lead guard. He is a legitimate superstar at one of pro basketball's most fungible, yet important positions. And, in the ever-changing style of the modern NBA game, what maybe makes the surefire future Hall of Famer most attractive for a suitor is his capacity to excel in every style of basketball: If you want to play small or big, fast or slow, Paul is elite across the board. The Western Conference, however, is loaded, with Golden State and San Antonio both on pace for historically great seasons and Oklahoma City nipping at their heels. At best -- even with a healthy Griffin -- the 30-16 Clippers are a four seed without home court, tasked with going on the road against either the Warriors or Spurs, neither of whom have lost a single home game this season. And that's a best case scenario. This is a good team, but hardly a threat to the upper echelon of the league, given its inability to maintain a cohesive locker room and patchwork bench.The reality for this franchise is that until the Paul and Griffin era, it was nothing but an afterthought in NBA circles, the ugly step-brother of the Lakers, whose only similarity was that they shared an arena.Before Paul's tenure with the organization, the Clips had reached the playoffs just four times in nearly three decades since the 1984 move to Los Angeles. During his four years, Paul's teams reached the playoffs every season. So compiling 50-win seasons compounded by repeated postseason appearances -- albeit brief ones -- isn't the worst thing in the world. But simply put, the longer it waits to deal Paul, the more the Clippers ultimately risk sinking further in its quest for a first title.A deal now would ensure that whomever acquires the soon-to-be nine-time All-Star would have his services guaranteed for at least the remainder of 2016 and another full season after that. And, more importantly for Ballmer and company, it would allow the team to extract maximum talent in return. ""We‚Äôre all like family,"" Paul told the team's website. ""That's how we're going to deal with this, as a family.""That may be true, but families can break up. Painful as it may be to disband ""Lob City,"" dealing Paul is really the only move left.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

Americans don‚Äôt see much difference between candidates‚Äô ideology, and they‚Äôre not sure what party leaders want either. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, January 28, 2016.TRUMP CONTINUES TO DEFY SKEPTICS - New polls in Iowa and New Hampshire show Donald Trump sitting comfortably atop the rest of the Republican field. The Iowa GOP contest has gone from a near-tie between Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) earlier this week to an average seven-point advantage for Trump. An NBC/WSJ/Marist poll out Thursday morning shows that 76 percent of Trump‚Äôs supporters are firmly committed to him, while 58 percent of Cruz‚Äôs are sure of their choice. [Marist]But he'll need sky-high turnout - However, pollsters are finding that Trump‚Äôs support is strongest among those who haven‚Äôt participated in caucuses in the past. Monmouth: ""Based on past voting history and voters‚Äô stated intentions to attend this year‚Äôs caucuses, the current poll estimates turnout will be 170,000 voters, which would far surpass the 122,000 record GOP turnout from four years ago. Increasing the poll‚Äôs turnout projection to 200,000 voters widens Trump‚Äôs lead to 32% over 21% for Cruz, with Rubio at 16% and Carson at 9%. Decreasing the turnout projection to 130,000 voters, which would still be a record level, puts the race in a tie at 26% for Trump and 26% for Cruz, with Rubio at 15% and Carson at 12%"" [Monmouth]Trump has a runaway lead in New Hampshire - In the second state to vote, Trump enjoys a nearly 20-point lead over his closest rivals. The more interesting story is that Ohio Gov. John Kasich has quietly slipped into second place ahead of Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla). The race remains tight between those three, with only about 2 percentage points separating second from fourth. [Emerson College, Marist]DEMOCRATIC RACES HAVE TURNED INTERESTING TOO - Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has steadily gained on Hillary Clinton in Iowa, where she leads, on average, by less than half a percentage point. But as with the Republicans, pollsters have found that turnout will matter hugely in the outcome. Sanders supporters are younger and have less history of participating in caucuses than Clinton‚Äôs. The clich√© is true: It will all come down to turnout. [Marist]Sanders strong in New Hampshire - Unless there‚Äôs a substantial change after Iowa, Sanders looks like the overwhelming favorite to win New Hampshire. [Emerson College, Marist]NO BUMP IN IOWA VOTER REGISTRATION YET - Gideon Resnick: ""If the major political parties had some trick up their sleeves to get more voters registered ahead of the Iowa caucus, it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. With under a week left until people vote for the first time in 2016, the number of registered Democrats and Republicans has remained fairly static in the last six months. So the big crowds at rallies for Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump‚Äîwhere they boast of attracting new caucus goers in droves‚Äîhasn‚Äôt translated into big gains when it comes to registered support."" [Daily Beast]AMERICANS ONLY SEE MINOR DIFFERENCES IN CANDIDATES‚Äô IDEOLOGY - Michael Pollard and Joshua Mendelsohn: ""Although much has been written about the differences between 'establishment' and'outsider' candidates in the U.S. presidential election, voters don't see each party's candidates as very ideologically different‚Ä¶.The average political spectrum scores for each candidate, and of survey respondents themselves, are presented in the figure, ranging from very liberal on the left, to very conservative on the right‚Ä¶.Republicans reported on their personal political viewpoint (Self [R]) as did Democrats (Self [D])....Among the Republican candidates, Ted Cruz and Ben Carson are rated to have more conservative political viewpoints than Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, and Jeb Bush. Among Democratic candidates, Bernie Sanders is rated to have a more liberal political viewpoint than Hillary Clinton. The difference is relatively small in size but statistically significant."" [RAND]The study also shows how Donald Trump has created a large coalition of supporters. - Michael Tesler: ‚ÄúCommentators have argued for months that Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign has the potential to unite white Americans‚Äô ethnic and economic anxieties into a powerful populist coalition‚Ä¶.New data show just how successful Trump has been‚Ä¶.the Trump coalition unites resentment of minority groups with support for economically progressive policies‚Ä¶.[E]conomically progressive positions, combined with Trump‚Äôs harsh rhetoric about minority groups, seem to have created a powerful populist coalition that has made Trump the front-runner heading into the Iowa caucuses.‚Äù [Monkey Cage]GOP VOTERS DON'T HAVE A CLUE ON WHICH CANDIDATES REPUBLICAN LEADERS PREFER - HuffPollster: ""The continued polling dominance of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and businessman Donald Trump has left many Republican leaders exasperated, and rank-and-file voters pretty much clueless about who their party would rather see as the nominee. By this point in an election cycle, voters often have a general sense of where the political establishment stands. This year, though, the Republican Party hasn't decided much of anything...So perhaps it's not surprising that, when asked whether party leaders would prefer a Trump or Cruz victory, Republican and Republican-leaning voters had no idea. In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, 38 percent thought most political leaders in the Republican Party would prefer Cruz to Trump, while a near-identical 36 percent thought the opposite.""[HuffPost] The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling.OBAMACARE NOT ON AMERICANS‚Äô PRIORITY LIST FOR ELECTION - Bianca DiJulio, Jamie Firth, Ashley Kirzinger, and Mollyann Brodie: ‚ÄúDespite the ongoing debate between Republican lawmakers and President Obama on the future of the 2010 health care law, the ACA is only one of many issues that may impact voting decisions, with nearly a quarter (23 percent) saying it‚Äôs extremely important, but only four percent choosing it as the MOST important issue. Across all issues included in the poll, terrorism (38 percent) and the economy/jobs (34 percent) are the top two issues for voters at this point in the election. In addition, about 3 in 10 voters (28 percent) say the personal cost of health care and health insurance is extremely important and six percent say it is MOST important, which is similar to the shares of voters who say the same about a number of other issues. Across parties, neither the ACA nor the cost of their health care rank higher than fourth in what voters say will be most important.‚Äù [Kaiser Family Foundation]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

20,POLITICS,How Planned Parenthood Outsmarted Its Accusers By Turning The Tables On Them,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/planned-parenthood-texas_us_56aa36e3e4b05e4e370374ba,Not even a pro-life Texas prosecutor bought the anti-abortion campaigners' tactics.,2016-01-28,When Huckabee compared Planned Parenthood to a heroin dealer.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560d7db41900002f00fdef3d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"(Reuters) - An aggressive legal strategy pursued by U.S. women's healthcare provider Planned Parenthood may have been critical in turning the tables on opponents who were seeking to prosecute it in Texas for allegedly profiting from sales of aborted fetal tissue.In a surprise move disclosed on Monday, a grand jury in Harris County not only cleared Planned Parenthood's Gulf Coast affiliate but also indicted the two anti-abortion activists, David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, who had prompted the probe in the first place.They have both been charged with using fake driver's licenses and Daleiden for violating Texas' prohibition on the purchase and sale of human organs - the same law he accused Planned Parenthood of breaking - when he sent an email to Planned Parenthood seeking to buy fetal tissue. Their lawyers say they have done nothing wrong.Planned Parenthood's legal strategy was in some ways similar to how corporations facing major white-collar criminal investigations often cooperate closely with prosecutors to try to influence the outcome.From the start, Planned Parenthood and its Houston lawyer Josh Schaffer settled on a strategy of cooperating with investigators, said Rochelle Tafolla, a spokeswoman for the affiliate. It included volunteering documents and encouraging prosecutors to interview employees, as well as giving prosecutors tours of the Houston facility, according to Schaffer.""We certainly began the process as suspects of a crime, and the tables got turned and we ended up victims of a crime,"" Schaffer told Reuters in an interview.Schaffer was retained by Planned Parenthood last summer when Texas officials demanded it face a criminal investigation after the anti-abortion activists posted videos online purporting to show the organization's employees discussing the sale of aborted fetal tissue, which is illegal in the United States if done for a profit.The videos produced by Daleiden's Center for Medical Progress were secretly filmed at Planned Parenthood clinics, such as its Houston facility, and including at least one conversation in a restaurant. Planned Parenthood said it has done nothing wrong and commissioned an outside study that said the videos had been deceptively edited.According to Planned Parenthood, officials have cleared it of wrongdoing in 12 U.S. states in the wake of the allegations.STARTED A DIALOGUESchaffer said very soon after he was hired he began a dialogue with prosecutors in Harris County, which includes much of Houston, about the details of the case, and kept that going throughout.The office of Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson declined an interview request. Anderson said in a statement on Monday: ""All the evidence uncovered in the course of this investigation was presented to the grand jury. I respect their decision on this difficult case.""A Republican who has been the Houston area's prosecutor since 2013, Anderson last summer pledged a ""thorough investigation"" and a prosecution to the full extent of the law ""should we find that laws were broken."" Campaign material from her 2014 race for district attorney described her as a ""proud, pro-life Texan mother of two.""Although what happened during the grand jury's secret deliberations may never be known, Schaffer said it did not vote on whether to indict Planned Parenthood.That is because the grand jury‚Äôs focus shifted to a case against the anti-abortion campaigners, Schaffer said on a conference call with reporters, citing information he said he received from a prosecutor.Planned Parenthood said that Daleiden and Merritt used fake driver's licenses in April 2015 when they posed as executives from a fictitious company to secretly film conversations at the Houston facility. That led to the charges they used fake government documents with the intent to defraud.One critical juncture in the case may have occurred when Planned Parenthood gave law enforcement an important tip: Merritt's true name, according to Schaffer.Her identity remained unknown from the time she visited Planned Parenthood with a fake California driver's license until about December when Daleiden revealed it during a deposition as part of a separate civil lawsuit in state court in Los Angeles, Schaffer said.As part of his strategy, Schaffer said he explicitly pushed prosecutors to charge Daleiden and Merritt.""I made the argument regarding the charges that the grand jury returned,"" Schaffer said in the interview, ""but I did not have to make them very forcefully because it was self-evident to the prosecutors that they engaged in this conduct.""PROTECTING SOURCESPeter Breen, a lawyer on Daleiden's defense team, said the grand jury misapplied Texas law, indicting the two under an anti-fraud statute meant to be used against identity thieves, not against people trying to uncover wrongdoing.Terry Yates, a Houston lawyer representing Merritt and Daleiden, told reporters the grand jury‚Äôs indictments ‚Äúare legally and factually insufficient and are not going to hold up under the weight of the law.‚ÄùDaleiden, who says he uses journalistic techniques, could not have cooperated with Texas authorities‚Äô as extensively as Planned Parenthood without surrendering his rights as an investigator, Breen said. He needed to protect his sources and methods, including Merritt‚Äôs name, and he posted what relevant information he had online, the attorney said.""Numerous law enforcement and legislative bodies across the country have reached out to David,"" Breen said. ""He has done everything he can to cooperate with their investigations.""Breen said he did not want to speculate as to why an investigation that began focused on Planned Parenthood suddenly turned on its accusers instead, but he said the district attorney should use her authority to drop the charges.(Reporting by David Ingram and Jilian Mincer in New York; Additional reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin; and Ruthy Munoz in Houston; Editing by Amy Stevens and Martin Howell)Also on HuffPost:"

22,SPORTS,17 Fun Tidbits About Super Bowl 50 That Will Get You Hyped,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/super-bowl-50-trivia_us_56a68204e4b0404eb8f286b6,Cam Newton wasn't born the last time a Heisman-winning QB played in the Super Bowl.,2016-01-28,Now coach Gary Kubiak as a member of the Denver Broncos. Kubiak is pictured here next to teammate John Elway.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a6871d2a00006e000313c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Feb. 7, 2016, the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers will take the field in Santa Clara, California, with each side hoping to be bathed in champagne by the end of the night. Coined the ‚ÄúGolden Super Bowl,‚Äù Super Bowl 50 already has a few easily identifiable storylines that‚Äôll smatter the headlines in the days before kickoff. Can the experience of the Broncos counteract the youth of the Panthers? What tricks does the aging Peyton Manning have up his sleeve as he tries to keep up with the ever-electric, uber-athletic Cam Newton?While no one knows exactly how the dominos will fall until the clubs play their first down in two weeks' time, what we do know is that Super Bowl 50 will be incredibly unique, no matter who comes out on top. Even down to its name -- the NFL nixed the game's typical Roman numerals in honor of its semicentennial anniversary -- this year‚Äôs iteration of the championship bout has some of the most eyebrow-raising footnotes in recent memory. So as we all wait for next month's pregame coin toss, here are 17 tidbits that show just how truly special this year‚Äôs matchup is.1. Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning is currently tied in first with Brett Favre for career quarterback wins (199). If this ends up being Manning‚Äôs final year in the NFL, a Super Bowl win would just put him over the top. 2. This will be the only time in NFL history that the game‚Äôs two starting quarterbacks were the No. 1 picks in their respective drafts.3. Eighteen-year vet Manning is the first signal caller ever to lead multiple franchises to the ‚Äôship multiple times.4. Newton is 26. Manning is 39. That‚Äôs the greatest quarterback age difference in Super Bowl history.5. Super Bowl 50 marks the first time that a given draft's first two picks will go head to head in the February Classic (Cam Newton and Von Miller, 2011).6. Both the Panthers‚Äô Ron Rivera and the Broncos‚Äô Gary Kubiak dethroned the same guy -- John Fox -- to earn their respective head coaching positions.7. While Carolina went 15-1 in the regular season, just two of the six past clubs that notched at least 15 pre-playoffs victories went on to win the title: the 1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears.8. On Feb. 7, Denver‚Äôs Kubiak will become the only NFLer to have played and coached for the same squad in the Super Bowl.9. If the MVP race goes as expected and the Panthers claim the title, Newton will become the first signal caller in history to have brought home the Heisman, National Championship, NFL MVP and Super Bowl trophies.10. Carolina has a chance to go 18-1 this year. Only a few teams in NFL history have done so, and Panthers coach Ron Rivera just happened to be on one of those clubs (the 1985 Chicago Bears).11. If we include the postseason, the Panthers currently have a .500 all-time record (175-175-1). If they do manage to win it all this year, the Santa Clara victory would bump the franchise up to a winning record for the first time since 1998.12. When the team steps on the field in February, Carolina will be the first NFC South franchise ever to play in more than one Super Bowl.13. Assuming that he does indeed start next month, Manning will have had the bleakest regular-season TD/INT ratio (nine touchdowns, 17 interceptions) of any starting signal caller since the 1970‚Äôs. Vince Ferragamo of Super Bowl XIV beat him out, having tallied just five touchdowns to his 10 interceptions back in 1979.14. Manning‚Äôs 9:17 marker does, however, match the second-worst TD/INT ratio in league history. While trailing Ferragamo, his 0.53 matches Bart Starr‚Äôs dismal stat from the 1967 regular season.15. Newton -- known as a dual-threat quarterback -- will be the first QB ever to enter the Super Bowl having tallied two rushing touchdowns and over 300 passing yards in a single game. Newton pulled off the feat in Sunday's NFC Championship game.16. Ronald Reagan was president -- and Cam Newton wasn't yet born -- the last time a Heisman-winning signal caller played in the Super Bowl. It was January 1984 and Jim Plunkett was competing in Super Bowl XVIII.17. After going 7-8-1 in 2014, Carolina is the first team in 12 years to clinch a Super Bowl berth just one season after putting up a sub-.500 record. The last squad to do so? The Panthers in 2003.

News, the sixth season of ""American Horror Story"" will not be about the Slender Man. Kristin Dos Santos reports that the rumors are false. We'll have to wait until March to find out the theme of the new season, which Santos says has been referenced in previous seasons. PREVIOUSLY: After the Murder House, an alien-infested asylum, a coven, a freak show and a vampiric hotel, ""American Horror Story"" must truly outdo itself if it wants to build off the momentum of Season 5's critical acclaim. Although many have long hoped that the horror series would go to summer camp or space, it looks like Season 6 is set to explore one of the most terrifying creatures of the modern age: Slender Man. According to Us Weekly, a source close to the show revealed that the creators are in talks to adapt the supernatural character, which was created as an Internet meme in 2009, to make it work for the ""AHS"" universe. (""American Horror Story: Memes"" should definitely be Season 7.)Slender Man, a figure who has gone by many names, including ""Fear Dubh (or, The Dark Man) in Scotland, the Dutch Takkenmann (Branch Man), and the German legend of Der Grosse Mann (the Tall Man),"" can best be described as a faceless and freakishly tall man who terrorizes and psychologically traumatizes his victims, often children.Making the potential story that much more unsettling, in 2014, two 12-year-olds claimed that they stabbed their friend 19 times to ""please"" Slender Man after discovering the meme online. According to the criminal complaint, the two girls planned to ""run away to the demon's forest mansion after the slaying.""One of the girls even revealed that Slender Man infiltrated her dreams and had the ability to read minds and teleport, according to The Associated Press. ""AHS"" has always been attracted to horror stories based in reality -- think the Black Dahlia in Season 1 or the Anne Frank storyline in Season 2 -- so taking on the Slender Man myth actually makes perfect sense.It's unlikely that Lady Gaga, who received top billing in the series' fifth season, will be playing the fictitious character, but the same Slender Man source told Us Weekly that producers are also trying to coax the superstar into returning for another season. Gaga for Slender Man!We reached out to FX for a comment and will update the post accordingly. Also on HuffPost:"

But they could also be collecting civilians' texts and calls.,2016-01-28,"Police in 23 states are known to have stingray surveillance devices, according to the ACLU.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56aa531b1f00007f00216d75.jpeg?ops=crop_46_130_711_517%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"You might not realize it, but your text messages and phone calls could be intercepted by local police on the hunt for a suspect. This is a practice widely used across the country, and a handful of states are trying to place limits on the controversial technology that makes it possible.New legislation proposed last week in Illinois makes this state the most recent to attempt a crackdown on the use of so-called ""stingray"" devices, also known as ""cell site simulators."" While this tech is meant to capture cell phone data from suspected criminals, it's used to sweep up data from a large area and can pull in text and call content from innocent civilians. The devices mimic cell phone towers, tricking cell phones into connecting to them. Illinois' bill, introduced by State Senator Daniel Biss, would require police to obtain a warrant before switching on the stingrays and would force police to delete civilians' text and call records accidentally collected during an investigation. Police in 23 states are known to have stingray devices, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Four states have already passed laws requiring police to get a warrant before using stingrays, per ABC Chicago affiliate WLS.Sponsors of the proposed Illinois law say the warrantless collection of civilian phone data, even if it‚Äôs accidental, could violate privacy rights. Civil liberties groups are also worried. ""We are concerned with assuring that the devices operate within our accepted constitutional framework,"" Edwin Yohnka, the public policy and communications director the American Civil Liberties Union told The Huffington Post in an email Wednesday.Under the proposed law, he said, ‚ÄúIf you or I were in an area where a stingray is being used, government won‚Äôt have a record of that fact -- we are therefore free to travel without that surveillance.""If passed, the proposed surveillance legislation would bring Illinois in line with federal law. In October, the Department of Justice announced new rules requiring federal investigators to obtain a warrant before using stingrays. But the rules don‚Äôt apply to local police. Illinois's police practices came into the national spotlight last year after Chicago officer Jason Van Dyke was charged in the shooting death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Law enforcement officials say that stingrays help them catch criminals. But federal investigators haven't disclosed much information about how and when such devices are used. In one case, feds seized stingray records from a local police department to keep them out of the hands of watchdog groups.State Representative Ann Williams, who sponsored the bill in the Illinois House of Representatives, hopes the proposed legislation will help protect rights in an era of rapid technological change. ""Basic protections are no different because of advancing technology. The law has to keep up with it,"" Williams told the Chicago Tribune last week. "

Some were seized during a highway stop that led to a confrontation and shooting that killed Robert ""LaVoy"" Finicum, who served as a spokesman for the occupiers, and the wounding of an unnamed individual.""Let me be clear, it is the actions and choices of the armed occupiers of the refuge that has led us to where we are today,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge Greg Bretzing said at a press conference Wednesday, urging those still at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge to clear out.He warned that ""actions are not without consequences,"" but said anyone remaining at the refuge would be allowed to leave after being identified at law enforcement checkpoints that have been set up.Ammon Bundy, in a statement through his attorney, also urged those remaining at the wildlife refuge to leave and go home.""To those remaining at the refuge, I love you,"" Bundy said in the statement. ""Let us take this fight from here. Please stand down. Go home and hug your families."" Three people connected with the occupation were arrested on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported.A statement released by the FBI and the Oregon State Police said Duane Leo Ehmer, 45, of Irrigon, Oregon, Dylan Wade Anderson, 34, of Provo, Utah, and Jason S. Patrick, 43, of Bonaire, Georgia, turned themselves in to agents at a checkpoint near the refuge. All three are expected to face a charge of conspiracy to impede officers of the United States from discharging their official duties through the use of force, intimidation or threats.It was unclear how many militants remained inside the center.Bundy and all but one of those who were arrested on Tuesday appeared before a federal magistrate judge on Wednesday afternoon; she ordered them to remain jailed until at least Friday without bail.It appears that only a few occupiers remain at the wildlife refuge, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. The Los Angeles Times reported some of the remaining militants have made threats on livestream broadcasts, calling the standoff a ""free-for-all Armageddon.""Law enforcement officials have provided few details on the arrests and shootings. Some sources said Finicum charged FBI agents, who then shot him. The Bundy Ranch said Finicum didn't provoke law enforcement.A judge released a criminal complaint charging those arrested Tuesday with conspiracy to prevent federal officials from performing their duties.The occupation started at the beginning of the month amid a protest over the treatment of a rancher and his son. Those two were ordered imprisoned as the result of an appeals court ruling related to their conviction on arson charges in 2012.The standoff has stretched on for weeks. Federal authorities took a calculated approach and did not immediately attempt to take back the federal property. Militants at the refuge indicated in interviews with The Huffington Post that they weren't too worried about getting into trouble with the law.The law enforcement action came amid calls from Oregon political leaders for a more aggressive approach to the occupation, which has disrupted life in Harney County for weeks.""It's time for everybody in this illegal occupation to move on,"" Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward said.Reporters have cleared out of the refuge, which the remaining militants on location saw as a sign that federal authorities were preparing to take final action.""Media has been ordered to leave, which means they're coming to kill us, and they don't want them to see that,"" one man said in a livestream from the refuge. ""They're going to murder all of us.""Nick Visser contributed to this story.This article has been updated to include Wednesday's court appearances, Ammon Bundy's statement and the latest arrests.Also on HuffPost:"
29,MEDIA,Donald Trump Expects The Media To Do What He Wants -- Because It Often Does,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-media-fox-debate_us_56a90c8be4b0947efb664406,The Republican front-runner is skipping the Fox debate and allowing rival networks to cover his competing event live.,2016-01-27,"This week, the media was once again consumed by the latest stunt from Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a918642a00002c0003164e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- After Donald Trump announced Tuesday night that he would boycott Thursday's Fox News debate, Megyn Kelly, one of the event‚Äôs moderators and the frequent object of Trump's ire, warned the real estate mogul on her primetime show that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt get to control the media.‚ÄùEvents of the past seven months suggest otherwise. Trump‚Äôs decision to bow out of the debate led to dozens of cable-news segments Wednesday, and landed him on the front pages of both The New York Times and The Washington Post. The master showman, who blamed Kelly's supposed bias against him for his decision, has once again pushed his Republican rivals to the margins -- this time with the Iowa caucuses just five days away. Far from being a dramatic 11th-hour gesture, Trump's boycott was simply yet another hijacking of the media spotlight -- the latest in a series that dates back to his campaign launch in June, when he went into a xenophobic rant against Mexican immigrants. News executives can argue that Trump deserved this week's outpouring of attention because of his front-runner status and because his candidacy is a phenomenon that transcends culture, media and politics. That's true, to a point. But Trump was also the most-covered candidate long before pundits and polling wizards thought he had any chance of becoming the nominee, before he was filling massive stadiums and appearing on ""Saturday Night Live."" And that coverage often came at the cost of journalistic norms.Trump has been allowed to phone in to cable news and Sunday shows seemingly whenever he wants, though other candidates are expected to appear in person or by remote broadcast. Cable channels have given him hundreds of thousands of dollars in free national airtime by repeatedly playing his first TV ad, which included his bigoted proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country.Many of his demonstrably false assertions have gone unchallenged in TV interviews, including his oft-repeated claim that he was one of the only people to foresee the disastrous consequences of invading Iraq and to speak out against it. (In reality, the remarks Trump's been holding up as an example of his prescience were made in 2004, over a year after the war had already started.)He does all this, moreover, while running a campaign unmatched in its hostility to reporters. In November, network bureau chiefs raised concerns with Trump's top aides, citing, among other things, instances where their reporters were kept in a press pen long after the candidate himself had left the stage. But the situation has persisted, along with concerns that the Trump campaign may be using the Secret Service to enforce its restrictions on the media.Instead of boycotting Trump events in protest of this treatment, the press is still flocking to them -- even as the vitriol continues to pile up. The Trump campaign recently ejected a New York Times reporter from an event just days after he'd written a story critical of Trump's ground game. Other reporters were warned the same day that they'd be removed from the event if they tried to talk to Trump supporters. Trump's campaign manager once threatened to blacklist a CNN reporter for covering a protest inside an event. The Trump campaign has also barred reporters from BuzzFeed, The Des Moines Register, Fusion and The Huffington Post, which had previously shifted most of its coverage of the candidate to the site‚Äôs entertainment section. Trump not only bashes journalists on Twitter to his 5.8 million followers, but has ridiculed reporters by name at rallies and at one point mocked a Times reporter with a disability. He also regularly complains that TV cameras aren‚Äôt panning to show the crowd. Last week he tried to order photographers at a Las Vegas rally to get pictures of the audience. Trump has taken credit for the New Hampshire Union Leader being removed from a Republican debate. And even before Trump complained about National Review‚Äôs ‚ÄúAgainst Trump‚Äù issue, the conservative publication had already been yanked from an upcoming CNN debate. If anyone knows the real degree of Trump's hold on the media, it's Kelly herself. After the first Republican primary debate, where she'd challenged Trump on his history of sexist behavior, he responded with what was widely taken to be a vulgar implication that Kelly was menstruating at the time. He appeared, four days later, on ""Fox & Friends"" -- by phone.Trump threatened to boycott Fox News the following month, but was on the channel soon thereafter, with nary an apology offered to Kelly, the network's fastest-rising star. He received more than twice as much airtime on Fox News from May through December as any other Republican candidate. So it's fair to see why Trump would assume Fox News would remove Kelly from Thursday's debate at his request. But the network hasn't said it will do so, and there's nothing to suggest that will change. Still, this doesn't mean the media has stopped making concessions for Trump. Even amid the debate fracas, Trump is scheduled to appear Wednesday night on Fox News' top-rated show, ""The O'Reilly Factor."" On Wednesday, Trump announced plans to hold an event for veterans in Des Moines, Iowa, on Thursday evening, to compete with the Fox News debate. Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told reporters soon after that ""all major networks"" are invited to carry Trump's event live."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during a GOP presidential candidate debate earlier this month. Republican voters don't know which of the two candidates their party's leaders would prefer to nominate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a93eca2a00006e00031687.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The continued polling dominance of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and businessman Donald Trump has left many Republican leaders exasperated, and rank-and-file voters pretty much clueless about who their party would rather see as the nominee. By this point in an election cycle, voters often have a general sense of where the political establishment stands. This year, though, the Republican Party hasn't decided much of anything. As this chart from FiveThirtyEight shows, no candidate has earned anywhere near the level of support Mitt Romney had gained before the Iowa caucus in 2012, or John McCain in 2008. Cruz so far has picked up fewer than two dozen endorsements, all from House representatives, while Trump hasn't been backed by anyone from the House or Senate, or by any of the nation's governors.So perhaps it's not surprising that, when asked whether party leaders would prefer a Trump or Cruz victory, Republican and Republican-leaning voters had no idea. In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, 38 percent thought most political leaders in the Republican Party would prefer Cruz to Trump, while a near-identical 36 percent thought the opposite.Republican voters, who prefer outsider candidates over establishment ones by a 2-to-1 margin, aren't exactly apt to be wooed by a candidate's insider cred. But even if they were to look to the party for guidance on choosing between the two, they wouldn't find much of it.The establishment's antipathy to Trump is widespread and well-known. However, recent stories from The Washington Post and The Associated Press have suggested the GOP establishment is grudgingly coming to terms with Trump as an alternative to Cruz, who they worry could hurt their chances of winning other races in 2016. ""Without any clear signals from the party elites, how could anyone know what they want?"" political scientist Hans Noel said in an email. ""[P]eople are getting mixed messages."" The lack of strong party signaling isn't limited to Trump and Cruz. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), often floated as the strongest establishment option, has gotten only tepid official support from his party. While GOP voters have generally picked up on the idea that the party would prefer Rubio to his outsider rivals, they say so by a relatively narrow margin: 20 points over Cruz, and 19 over Trump.The Democratic primary draws a striking contrast. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton holds a record number of political endorsements -- and regardless of whether they support her, voters have gotten the message that she's the establishment favorite. Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say by a 50-point margin that most political leaders would favor her over Sanders.Trump's continued success has led to a debate on the strength of both the Republican Party and broader political science theories about the way parties influence nominations, none of which are likely to be resolved before the end of the primary. What's already clear, though, is that GOP voters aren't simply ignoring their party's messages -- they're not even sure what it's saying.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 23-25 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling.

37,SCIENCE,Four Graphics (And A Book) That Help Explain Climate Change,"Adam Voiland, NASA Earth Observatory",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-explained_us_56a8083fe4b0f71799284de3,"2015 was the world's warmest year, but these charts tell the long story about the climate.",2016-01-27,"Data from 2015, the warmest year ever recorded on Earth.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a8092b2a00002c0003156f.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Though blizzards and cold snaps may have made you forget the news from last week, 2015 was the warmest year in NASA‚Äôs global temperature record, which dates back to 1880. During a January 2016 press conference (see the slides here), Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA‚Äôs Goddard Institute for Space Studies, explained that 2015 was 0.87 degrees C (1.57¬∞F) above the 1951-80 average in the GISS surface temperature analysis (GISTEMP), one of four widely-cited global temperature analyses.The statistical record is notable, but keep in mind that this year is just part of a much longer story about the climate. If you want to learn more about climate science as a whole rather than just the latest headlines, here are a few resources that you may find informative. The list is not comprehensive (and we are open to more suggestions), but it is a useful starting point for understanding climate science.The plot above comes from an interactive graphic called ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Really Warming the World?‚Äù Put together by Eric Roston and Blacki Migliozzi of Bloomberg News (with assistance from NASA climatologists Gavin Schmidt and Kate Marvel), the chart does an excellent job of breaking down the various factors (greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar activity, orbital variations, etc.) that affect climate. It parses out visually how much each factor contributes. The bottom line: greenhouse gases are absolutely central to explaining global temperature trends since 1880. The screenshot above hints at what the interactive looks like, but I highly recommend heading over to Bloomberg to see the full graphic.Another invaluable graphic for understanding climate change is the ‚Äúradiative forcing bar chart‚Äù below. (You can read an interesting post by Schmidt that explains how these charts have evolved over the decades). At first glance, the chart from the fifth assessment report by the United Nations‚Äô Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change may seem technical and difficult to understand. It is. But it is well worth looking up the technical terms.In short, you are looking at a balance sheet of the major types of emissions that have either a warming or cooling effect on climate. Bars that extend to the left of the 0 signify a cooling effect; bars that extend to the right signify warming. The longer the bar, the more warming or cooling a given type of emissions contributes. What becomes immediately obvious is that carbon dioxide (CO) and methane (CH) have the biggest warming influence by far. The other well-mixed greenhouse gases ‚Äî halocarbons, nitrous oxide (N0), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) play a much smaller role.The situation gets messy when you look at the role that short-lived gases and aerosols play. Some gases like carbon monoxide (CO) and the non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) ‚Äî such as benzene, ethanol, formaldehyde ‚Äî contribute to warming, but not much. Others like NO actually slightly cool the climate overall if you consider how these gases interact with other substances in the atmosphere. Things get even messier if you look at aerosols. Mineral dust, sulfate, nitrate, and organic carbon have a cooling effect. On the other hand, black carbon causes warming. Albedo changes due to land use and changes in solar irradiance are minor in comparison to the other factors.That‚Äôs a lot of variables, but one reason I like this chart is the error bars and the ‚Äúlevel of confidence‚Äù column. The error bars give you a sense of how much uncertainty there is when it comes to the effects of various emissions. Look at the aerosol section, for instance, and you will see that the error bars are quite large and there is still some uncertainty about how aerosols affect clouds. The level of confidence column offers further clues to what scientists understand well and which areas they are less confident about. VH stands for very high confidence; H stands for high confidence; M stands for medium confidence; and L stands for low confidence.What is striking is that even when you account for the error bars, there is little doubt that carbon dioxide and methane are warming the climate.A third graphic, produced by NASA but based on data described here, is particularly compelling. Based on atmospheric information preserved in air bubbles in ancient ice cores, the plot offers a view of carbon dioxide levels in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere for the past 400,000 years. As this graph makes obvious, it has been a long time since carbon dioxide levels have been anywhere near where they are now.For a much more recent view of carbon dioxide levels, the animation above is useful. Produced by NASA‚Äôs Scientific Visualization Studio, the video shows a time-series of the distribution and concentration of carbon dioxide in the mid-troposphere, as observed by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the Aqua spacecraft. For comparison, the fluctuations in AIRS data is overlain by a graph of the seasonal variation and interannual increase of carbon dioxide observed at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii. You can clearly see seasonal variations in carbon dioxide levels, but notice also that the mid-tropospheric carbon dioxide shows a steady increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over time. That increase is because of human activity.My last recommendation will take longer for you to get through, but it is an invaluable resource. Physicist Spencer Weart offers a detailed but understandable account of the history of climate science research in his book The Discovery of Global Warming. You can read an extended version of book online on the American Institute of Physics‚Äô website. If you make it all the way through, you will know far more than most people about the climate.This post was originally published by NASA Earth Observatory.

38,TASTE,People Are Totally Clueless About What 'Natural' Food Labels Mean,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/natural-food-label-meaning_us_56a92ff8e4b0f7179928e3fd,But the FDA may provide more clarity soon.,2016-01-27,"The ""natural"" label has nothing to do with animal welfare or singing women.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a932ea2a00006e00031675.jpeg?cache=fPomk0Peqz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There‚Äôs a good chance the word ‚Äúnatural‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean what you think it does.At least not when you find it on food packaging. A substantial chunk of the population has at least some misconceptions about what the term means on food labels, according to a recent survey by Consumer Reports.Out of 1,005 respondents, 63 percent believed that the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù label meant a packaged food was produced without pesticides, 62 percent believed it meant the product contained no artificial ingredients, and 60 percent believed it meant a product was free of genetically modified organisms (GMO).When it comes to meat and poultry, 64 percent of survey-takers thought it meant the animals were raised without artificial growth hormones, 57 percent thought it meant they were raised without antibiotics or other drugs, and 50 percent believed it meant the animals ‚Äúwent outdoors.‚ÄùWhile we didn't analyze Consumer Reports' statistical methods, it seems safe to say that a good number of people are less than clear on how natural these ""natural"" foods really are.In fact, the word has no official, legal definition in the United States. The FDA website explicitly states that the agency ‚Äúhas not developed a definition for the use of the term.‚ÄùWhat the FDA does have is a ‚Äúlongstanding policy‚Äù that they ‚Äúconsider‚Äù the word to mean that ‚Äúnothing artificial or synthetic (including all color additives regardless of source) has been included in, or has been added to, a food that would not normally be expected to be in that food.‚Äù The policy means that this is the criteria the FDA may use to determine whether a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù label is misleading or not, if it‚Äôs brought to their attention. (The FDA does not pre-approve food labels.)Note that the current definition has nothing to do with pesticides, artificial growth hormones, GMOs or animal welfare.And as Consumer Reports points out, there are plenty of products out there with the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù label that don‚Äôt seem to fit even the FDA‚Äôs informal definition.But the lack of regulations around the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù label could change. In response to demands that the word have some official, formal meaning, the FDA is soliciting feedback from the public on what they think it should designate on food labels.

39,POLITICS,The U.S. Is Driving Less And Still Building More Highways,"Andrew Keatts, Kinder Institute for Urban Research",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/less-driving-more-highways_us_56a953f6e4b05e4e3703414b,"Makes sense, right?",2016-01-27,"Where the I-105 and I-110 meet in Los Angeles, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a957c71a00001001ab1775.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It would have been difficult to predict back in 2004 that Americans were about to cut back on driving.After all, Americans had been doing just the opposite for decades. By 2004, the average American drove 10,000 miles each year, up from just 5,400 miles annually in 1970.But from 2004 to 2014, the trend reversed. Americans drove less in each year than they had the year before. The average miles traveled over the course of the year fell nearly 1 percent each year over the 10-year period.But during that same period, the federal government steadily increased the amount of money it spent each year on highway expansion projects ‚Äì though there was a brief dip in annual expenditures during the recession.Despite the growth, the taxes and fees meant to cover highway expenses ‚Äì gasoline taxes, truck-related excise taxes and highway user fees ‚Äì didn‚Äôt keep pace. The federal gasoline tax, for example, isn‚Äôt indexed to inflation and has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993.As a result, the country now dips into its general fund to cover its long-term highway expenditures. And the gap between highway-related revenues and highway spending is only expected to grow, according to Congressional Budget Office projections.Those are insights from a report released this month prepared by nonprofit advocacy groups the U.S. PIRG Education Fund and Frontier Group that addresses ‚ÄúHighway Boondoggles.‚Äù It lists what the groups believe are the most misguided highway projects in the country.Here are two graphs the authors use to demonstrate the drastic changes in U.S. driving behavior and the federal government‚Äôs non-reaction to it.This first graph shows the average growth from one year to the next in total miles traveled per person in the U.S., broken down by decade. Though the per-capita growth turns negative for the first time in the 2000s, you can see that the rate of increase in driving had been trending downward each decade since the 1950s, when economic growth in the U.S. helped expand the middle class, homeownership, suburbanization, and vehicle ownership.‚ÄúDriving declined for a variety of reasons,‚Äù the report reads. ‚ÄúWhile the economic recession contributed to the fall in driving, the downturn began in 2004, years before the economic decline. The rate of growth in driving has been declining since the 1950s, in terms of both overall vehicle-miles traveled and per-capita driving.‚ÄùBy 2014, the most recent year with available data, Americans drove, on average, as much as they had in 1997, according to the report.Still, it‚Äôs worth nothing: for decades, total miles driven ‚Äì in other words, not on a per capita basis ‚Äì have been steadily increasing. They ticked upwards last year after being relatively stagnant in the post-recession years from 2008 to 2013.But the groups argue that highway expansions are usually justified by projected future vehicle miles traveled. While total VMT has increased over the years, it hasn‚Äôt come close to the federal government‚Äôs projections.‚ÄúIn 1999, the federal government anticipated that Americans would be driving 3.7 trillion miles per year by 2013 ‚Äì 26 percent more miles than we actually did,‚Äù the report reads. ‚ÄúThe U.S. Department of Transportation now forecasts that we will not attain those vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) levels until 2037.‚ÄùThe report credits a number of factors for the decline. For one, the number of Americans with licenses had been steadily increasing during the same period, though that number peaked in 2000, as did the number of cars per household. Plus, the ‚ÄúDriving Boom‚Äù tracked along with the period that Baby Boomers were part of the working population; driving has subsided as they‚Äôve left the workforce.It also points to increased interest in urban living, increased use of transit and decreased interest in driving among young people.But none of that has done much to discourage investment in highway projects. Neither the stagnation of revenues used to pay for highway projects.The federal highway trust fund has spent more than it‚Äôs collected each year since 2001, and the gap is expected to widen through 2025, the report concludes, based on CBO projections.That‚Äôs meant filling in the gap with general fund revenues.‚ÄúBailing out the Highway Trust Fund with general funds cost $65 billion between 2008 and 2014, including $22 billion in 2014 alone,‚Äù the report reads. ‚ÄúMaking up the projected shortfall through 2025 would cost an additional $147 billion.‚Äù(The CBO, meanwhile, has a more conservative estimate, putting the cost of the projected shortfall through 2025 at $108 billion in a report this month).Unsurprisingly, the specific highway projects the report questions include a handful from the famously car-loving Sun Belt. They include a $3.3 billion project to put congestion-bypassing toll lanes on three highways in Tampa; a $109 million, four-mile toll lane project on Austin‚Äôs Highway 45 Southwest; a $3.2 billion to $5.6 billion tunnel project in Los Angeles‚Äô San Gabriel Valley on I-710; a $647 million express lane project on Charlotte‚Äôs I-77; Houston‚Äôs own expansion of State Highway 249 for up to $389 million; and a $96 million highway extension in New Mexico.The Kinder Institute for Urban Research is a multi-disciplinary ‚Äòthink-and-do tank‚Äô housed on the Rice University campus in Houston.
