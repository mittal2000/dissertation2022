Last October, Evan Patrick Cater, 31, was allegedly found drunk and lying face-down near a neighbor's dog kennel. He wore camouflage and a mask, and carried both a 9 mm gun and ""bacon covered in an unknown substance,"" according to a news release from the Amherst County Sheriff's Office.His neighbor, Bobby Wood, called the sheriff's department after spotting Cater in his yard. Cater told deputies he was just relaxing, according to the Lynchburg News and Advance, which dubbed the pork product ""a suspicious bag of bacon.""The neighbors have a history: Wood has complained about Cater shooting firearms in his yard, which is part of a ""no-shoot zone"" that Cater has spoken out against, according to the News and Advance. Cater was charged with wearing a mask in public, trespassing, public intoxication and carrying a gun while intoxicated, the paper said. A judge certified the charges to a grand jury this week.

The three Democratic presidential candidates, who had debated gun safety legislation just two blocks away the previous night, had departed for Columbia, the state capital, early in the morning. Most of the reporters who had descended upon the city for the debate followed. But the Mother Emanuel survivors, along with the relatives of other shootings, had come to honor their loved ones and question the inevitability of gun violence. They weren’t alone in their grief: Charleston’s mayor, a state representative, gun safety advocates, various pastors and a survivor of domestic violence reassured them that they all were, as King said, “caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.” The rally’s speakers expressed a determination to prevent future tragedies.The church shooting has focused scrutiny on a gap in federal background checks. If a person walks into a gun store and buys a gun, as the accused shooter Dylann Roof did last year, but the requisite background check isn’t completed after three days, as Roof’s wasn’t, the store can proceed with the sale. Some gun sellers, like Walmart, choose not to sell firearms until the check is complete. Others, like the store Roof visited, don’t. Gun safety advocates have called this the “default to proceed” loophole, but it’s gained a new nickname -- the “Charleston loophole” -- since the shooting last year.The FBI said after Roof went on his racist rampage that he shouldn’t have been able to buy his gun because he had been charged with a misdemeanor last February for possessing Suboxone, a Schedule III narcotic, without a prescription. Data entry and investigative errors meant the FBI didn’t see Roof’s arrest report until it was too late.“Isn’t it a little embarrassing that this loophole is known as the ‘Charleston loophole?’” asked Charleston’s Democratic mayor, John Tecklenburg, at the rally. This association might be embarrassing to Tecklenburg. But it’s not to Republican state lawmakers, who have vowed to block any legislation that would address gun violence this session. (They do, however, want to pass legislation allowing South Carolinians to carry concealed weapons without a permit.) Republicans opposed to closing the loophole argue that most people who buy guns are law-abiding and that someone who is motivated to kill isn’t going to let more stringent background checks prevent them from buying a gun. They have also suggested that closing the loophole is really just cover for imposing other restrictions on gun ownership and that the Charleston shooting shouldn’t be exploited to advance gun safety measures.Hillary Clinton has elevated the loophole to prominence because her rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has some real vulnerabilities in his record on gun control. (Clinton was actually in Charleston, campaigning, the morning of the church shooting.) She has repeatedly noted, including at the debate Sunday, that Sanders voted against the 1993 Brady bill that established the national background checks system. He did, however, vote for an NRA-backed amendment that altered the legislation by requiring instant criminal background checks five years after enactment, though the technology to do so did not exist then. The current three-day period for authorities to complete a background check was a compromise between those who wanted a seven- or 10-day period for checks to be completed, and those, like Sanders, who wanted instant checks.The candidates tussled over the loophole on the Sunday morning talk shows as they prepared to debate each other that night. Clinton told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that she hoped Sanders would “take a hard look” at the issue. When Stephanopoulos later asked Sanders if he would support closing the loophole, the senator didn’t answer the question, instead saying that he has a D-minus rating from the National Rifle Association and has supported banning assault weapons. Stephanopoulos asked the question again.“Well, that one was a -- you know, we’re going to take a look at that as well,” Sanders responded. “But the issue here is that what my view has always been, and what is most important, is that we have a strong instant background check. I have supported that from day one and I want to see that expanded and put -- look, at the end of the day, what almost every American understands is we have got to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns.”What Sanders wasn’t acknowledging is that sometimes an instant background check is impossible. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence notes that though 91 percent of background checks conducted through the federal system provide an answer almost instantaneously, roughly 9 percent of cases require more investigating. In 2014, the loophole allowed over 2,500 prohibited purchasers to buy guns. Eighteen states, according to the center, have acted on their own to allow more time for background checks.These statistics provide compelling reasons to extend the amount of time authorities have to scrutinize gun purchasers before sales are allowed to proceed. Rep. James Clyburn, South Carolina’s only congressional Democrat, has responded by introducing the Background Check Completion Act. And Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut have done the same in the upper chamber.Among South Carolinians, the concept of preventing sales from proceeding before a background check is completed is immensely popular. Democratic state Sen. Marlon Kimpson, who represents Charleston and its surrounding areas in the legislature, is sponsoring legislation that would give authorities four weeks to complete a background check before a sale can go through, among other gun safety measures. Multiple Democrats, in both chambers of the legislature, have introduced similar bills.But Kimpson isn’t ready to write off his Republican colleagues yet, even though just one Republican in the legislature -- state Rep. Doug Brannon -- has introduced legislation to extend the time authorities have to complete background checks. In a conversation with The Huffington Post, Kimpson pointed to the bipartisan vote to remove the Confederate battle flag from the state house grounds last year -- in response to the Charleston shooting and Roof’s glorification of Confederate symbols -- as “a potential roadmap” for how to pass gun safety legislation. He also noted that the legislature voted, “with lightning speed,” to require that police officers wear body cameras after a North Charleston officer shot and killed Walter Scott during a traffic stop in April. “People are listening, and I’ve had some tell me that they’re keeping an open mind, particularly on the background check piece,” he said. “We have a recent track record of demonstrating that when people keep an open mind, the facts can change hard-core beliefs.”But as more time elapses, lawmakers worry that their quest to close the loophole will only get more challenging. It’s an election year, so the loophole has gotten attention from the presidential candidates, but its closure could be stalled for the same reason.“I have no doubt that if we had waited until today to deal with the Confederate flag issue it would never have come down,” said Democratic state Rep. Mia McLeod, who has introduced legislation to prevent gun sales from going through until a background check is completed. “Time has been used as a tool to maintain the status quo.”"

And that's wonderful.But the company did not implement the policy as a response to its terrible food safety crisis, which has sickened at least 500 people since July and has sunk the company's stock price and reputation. Chipotle announced paid sick leave for its hourly workers in June, well before the whole mess got started. The policy took effect in July, along with new paid vacation and tuition assistance benefits.In a press release on Tuesday, the company implied that it is giving paid sick leave as a direct response to the crisis. The burrito-maker provided a detailed list of measures for preventing another crisis, including DNA testing ingredients, strengthening its food safety training efforts, changing the way the company preps tomatoes, lettuce and other fresh food -- and giving paid sick leave ""to ensure that ill employees have no incentive to work while ill.""A few media outlets picked up on the apparent news. ""Chipotle To Give Employees Paid Sick Leave So They Don't Make Customers Ill,"" read Consumerist's headline. ""Chipotle boosts paid-sick leave in name of safety,"" said CNBC.Reached by email on Thursday, Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold confirmed that there is nothing new about the company's sick leave policy.Regardless of the reason, though, it's notable for a restaurant chain to give hourly workers paid sick leave. Very few hourly workers in the U.S. have such a benefit, which means a lot of sick people wind up coming into work and infecting their colleagues and customers. The U.S. is one of the few developed countries in the world that doesn't offer paid leave for sick employees.The actual cause of Chipotle's food safety issues -- which have resulted in lawsuits and a criminal inquiry -- is still unclear. But the company says it's using the crisis as an opportunity to take the lead on food safety going forward, looking at all aspects of its production processes ""from farm to restaurants,"" Arnold said in December. The company hopes its food safety plan ""will establish Chipotle as a leader in food safety.”"

With all the overblown controversy over end-zone dances this season, it seems that money might be needed come Feb. 7.In the video above, Eichner and Owens hit the streets to ask New Yorkers to show off their best touchdown dances.

8,SPORTS,James Harden's Glaring Defensive Problem Is Way Worse Than You Thought,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-hardens-glaring-defensive-problem_us_569a734ae4b0778f46f9899b,"The perennial All-NBA performer is as good as it gets offensively, but equally poor on the other side of the ball.",2016-01-21,"While his offensive genius comes without question, Harden's defensive regression has cost the Rockets dearly.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569d8cdc1a00005a00ab0d1d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"James Harden is arguably the NBA's best shooting guard. A splendid blend of step-back jump shots, gorgeous Euro-step forays to the basket and late-game heroics, Harden is undoubtedly one of the most devastating scorers of his generation.Harden's deadly offensive talent was clear from the start of his Rockets career. Over each of the past four seasons, the former Arizona State standout and No. 3 overall pick hasn't ranked outside of the top five in scoring. This year, his 27.6 points per game trail only the immortal Stephen Curry. But there is more to the game than just scoring. Despite his immense natural ability, the 26-year-old sniper seems to have forgotten about that.After an expected improvement to his individual defense last season, Harden's defensive regression this season has been unmistakeable. Opponents are shooting over 5 percent better when he's playing, as the USA Today noted in December. They connect on made field goals nearly 8 percent better from less than 10 feet and 4 percent better from greater than 15. You don't have to be a lockdown individual defender to become a useful defensive player in basketball. San Antonio has made a living by employing players like this. So too has Golden State en route to its two-way dominance. The Clippers' J.J. Redick is a prime example. Positioning, effort and basketball acumen lend themselves to team defense and Redick -- despite lacking elite foot speed and quickness -- can maximize other areas to mitigate this. In the video above, Harden's laziness results in the failure to box out and contest an easy layup that should never have even been attempted. Below, we see him whiff on a hapless help attempt -- where he is out of position -- that once again results in an easy layup for the opposition. Against Cleveland, he blows by Kyrie Irving on a busted closeout, resulting in a wide open pull-up jump shot. Each video shows Harden in a different, but equally poor lapse.Harden, for all his offensive prowess, either doesn't understand his lack of defensive effort or worse, simply doesn't care. And the Rockets, after an unexpected run to the Western Conference finals last year, are a pedestrian 22-22, barely good enough to earn a playoff bid.Defense is a crucial reason why we've seen such a surprising regression. While amassing a stellar 56 wins during the 2014-15 campaign, the Rockets ranked ninth in opponent field goal percentage and, almost as importantly, first in opponent 3-point percentage. But this season has been a different story.Houston -- already on coach No. 2 this season -- ranks a woeful 26th in field goal percentage against and just 16th in 3-point percentage allowed.

Of course, all of the onus does not fall on Harden: Dwight Howard has predictably been a colossal disappointment and Houston's two best perimeter defenders -- Trevor Ariza and Corey Brewer -- have struggled to contain dribble penetration. Harden, for all of his offensive genius, is the face of the franchise. He's a perennial All-NBA performer who just so happens to also be a defensive sieve.

9,SPORTS,James Harden's Glaring Defensive Problem Is Way Worse Than You Thought,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-hardens-glaring-defensive-problem_us_569a734ae4b0778f46f9899b,"The perennial All-NBA performer is as good as it gets offensively, but equally poor on the other side of the ball.",2016-01-21,"Harden has hovered around a -2.5 defensive box plus/minus this year, one of the worst clips in the league for shooting guards.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569d8c501f00005000216285.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"James Harden is arguably the NBA's best shooting guard. A splendid blend of step-back jump shots, gorgeous Euro-step forays to the basket and late-game heroics, Harden is undoubtedly one of the most devastating scorers of his generation.Harden's deadly offensive talent was clear from the start of his Rockets career. Over each of the past four seasons, the former Arizona State standout and No. 3 overall pick hasn't ranked outside of the top five in scoring. This year, his 27.6 points per game trail only the immortal Stephen Curry. But there is more to the game than just scoring. Despite his immense natural ability, the 26-year-old sniper seems to have forgotten about that.After an expected improvement to his individual defense last season, Harden's defensive regression this season has been unmistakeable. Opponents are shooting over 5 percent better when he's playing, as the USA Today noted in December. They connect on made field goals nearly 8 percent better from less than 10 feet and 4 percent better from greater than 15. You don't have to be a lockdown individual defender to become a useful defensive player in basketball. San Antonio has made a living by employing players like this. So too has Golden State en route to its two-way dominance. The Clippers' J.J. Redick is a prime example. Positioning, effort and basketball acumen lend themselves to team defense and Redick -- despite lacking elite foot speed and quickness -- can maximize other areas to mitigate this. In the video above, Harden's laziness results in the failure to box out and contest an easy layup that should never have even been attempted. Below, we see him whiff on a hapless help attempt -- where he is out of position -- that once again results in an easy layup for the opposition. Against Cleveland, he blows by Kyrie Irving on a busted closeout, resulting in a wide open pull-up jump shot. Each video shows Harden in a different, but equally poor lapse.Harden, for all his offensive prowess, either doesn't understand his lack of defensive effort or worse, simply doesn't care.

After multiple women in the music industry revealed that they too had experienced similar harassment from Berru, the publicist quickly stepped down from his role as CEO of Life Or Death PR. During the short 24 hours it took for Berru to leave his job, many of his clients publicly cut ties with him. Hip-hop artist Killer Mike was one of those clients. On Wednesday Killer Mike tweeted that he supported Coffman and he gave his ""friend"" Berru an ear-full about ""how fucked up he behaved."" Killer Mike tweeted that he immediately cut ties with Berru, and that Coffman and the other women who have come forward have his support. In a Facebook post published on Wednesday night, Killer Mike clarified his tweets. He wrote that he ""stand[s] in solidarity with the women that have spoke out,"" and that men in the industry need to do better when it comes to supporting women. ""Men have to be able to tell our friends and peers when they're wrong,"" Killer Mike wrote. ""We cannot just say, it's not my problem. We can't expect [people] to improve if we're not willing to hold them accountable and push them to be better.""Read the rest of Killer Mike's post below.More of this, please.H/T ViceAlso on HuffPost:"

It’s a basic human right -- the right to be safe,” Biden said at an event co-hosted by The Huffington Post and Goldman Sachs’ 10,000 Women Initiative, which supports female entrepreneurs in developing countries. The event was held during the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Biden met with international business and political leaders.While Biden lauded them for creating economic opportunities and hailed the ""exponential change"" for women in recent decades, he said women still face discrimination and violence.“You have to get to the point where you give them the freedom to be secure,"" he said. Biden cited his decades-long work on domestic violence, in particular the Violence Against Women Act he championed in the Senate, which he considers ""the proudest thing I’ve ever done."" Biden said he had hoped the legislation would help change attitudes toward women, especially the tendency to blame victims of sexual assault.""When a woman is raped, when a woman is abused, the first thing other women ask is what did you do? Why were you there? What were you wearing?"" Biden said. “Folks, all the opportunity and entrepreneurship in the world is good. But ultimately, starting in this country, we have to change the culture. And we’re not going to change that culture until not a single woman who is abused ever asks herself: 'What did I do?'""Biden also mentioned the widespread problem of sexual assault on college campuses. In 2014, the White House launched ""It's On Us,"" a campaign to hold more colleges and universities accountable for rapes and to encourage students and administrators to curb the culture of rape.“I think we have a real chance to have a cultural change. No means no. Yes doesn’t mean yes if you’re drunk and can’t say yes. It’s rape,"" he said.Biden implored men to speak up if they see instances of harassment and abuse of women, saying that “the most cowardly men I know are the ones who know it’s happening, but do nothing because it’s not good for them.”Biden celebrated the progress that world leaders have made in allowing women more economic opportunities, but lamented that more countries need to work on providing ""the basic building blocks"" for women.""If you lack basic freedom and equality, if you lack health, if you lack access to education, it’s really hard to start anything,"" he said.But in order to promote global progress in women's rights, Biden argued that the U.S. needs to do more at home to ensure equal opportunities.“Every single solitary opportunity that my son has, and my grandson, there’s not a single damn thing that my daughter, my granddaughter, my sister can’t do. Nothing,” he said. “The day I look forward to, when I see the women in the Senate, when there are 51 women in the Senate, we’ll finally be over whether or not we’re smarter or you’re smarter, or you’re more venal or we’re more venal. Women are just as venal as men. Same thing. Once we get to the place where it no longer is an issue, that’s when this country can take off.”Also on HuffPost:"

Taking his spot will be Robyn Blumner, the Dawkins Foundation’s executive director for the past two years.“I hope and I believe that this merger will significantly enhance the impact of CFI’s work, and, as a result, will also further some of the common goals of the secular movement, such as keeping religion out of public policy and reducing the stigma associated with being an atheist or humanist, which is still all too prevalent in the United States,” Lindsay said in an email interview.Blumner, who is based in Washington, D.C., said in a statement: “Secularism is on the ascendency in the United States and beyond. Science has proven to be the engine of human progress. Bringing more resources and ambition to promoting these forces of reason is what this merger is about.”It is not clear yet how the merger will affect the British branch of the Richard Dawkins Foundation, which operates a separate entity, Lindsay said. CFI, meanwhile, has 21 international branches or representatives, from Canada to Pakistan to Zambia, giving the Dawkins Foundation a more international scope.Dawkins, 74, has lent his name and fortune to projects throughout the atheist community, including science education programs and a push to encourage atheists and other nonbelievers to “come out” as such.His 2006 book, The God Delusion, ranked in the Top 10 of New York Times best-sellers that year and sold more than $3 million in copies. He has appeared in movies and television shows and is a frequent speaker at atheist, science and reason gatherings in the U.S. and abroad.In addition to his celebrity, he brings a good bit of cash to CFI. It has a $5.2 million budget for 2016 and 41 employees, according to numbers supplied by CFI before the merger. In addition to its focus on secularism, CFI has programs on human rights, freedom of expression and the advancement of science. The Dawkins Foundation will bring in an additional $1.3 million to $1.5 million and three employees, a CFI spokesman said.If the Dawkins Foundation brings assets, it also bring potential liabilities. Dawkins has made headlines in recent years with provocative remarks about women, Muslims and date rape. He is particularly prolific and controversial on Twitter, where he has 1.3 million followers.“There are going to be occasions and events where Professor Dawkins expressly represents CFI, and we’ll be proud to have him do so, as he’s one of the most skilled communicators of science and secularism of our time,” said Paul Fidalgo, director of communications for CFI.“He’s also his own person, and just like everyone else associated with or employed by CFI, he can and will speak for himself on occasion,” Fidalgo added, “and not necessarily for CFI.”The news came as a surprise to many within and outside of organized atheism. There are approximately 20 atheist, humanist and other secularist organizations, all of which have rubbed elbows or collaborated with the Dawkins Foundation in the past. Why did Dawkins take his celebrity and fortune to CFI instead of the American Humanist Association, American Atheists or the Freedom From Religion Foundation, some of which have given him awards in the past?“I think it is the science angle” at CFI, said Ryan Cragun, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Tampa who is working on a book about atheist and secular organizations. “Dawkins knows CFI is going to be around for a long time, they have resources in place to support his interest in science and reason. It makes sense to go with CFI.”Todd Stiefel, whose Openly Secular organization is a project of the Richard Dawkins Foundation, hailed the merger.“CFI is doing more on the skeptic side and the humanism side and legal side,” he said. “RDF is a much younger, smaller organization but is doing really well in science education and discrimination (against atheists). CFI has some of that, but this can really benefit both teams.”Writing on his Friendly Atheist blog, Hemant Mehta described the merger as “a win-win” situation and said it would make Blumner “one of the most powerful women in the world of organized atheism.”“It’s worth celebrating,” he said.Also on HuffPost:"

(Reich and Clare Dalton divorced in 2012; he has since remarried.) Resuming the academic career he had embarked on in 1980 as a professor at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, he took a position at Brandeis University and published a well-received serio-comic memoir about his years in the Clinton administration, Locked in the Cabinet.Other than an unsuccessful run for governor of Massachusetts in 2002, he has spent most of the past two decades as a de facto Economic Educator in Chief for millions of Americans. Reich, who co-founded the American Prospect magazine, and has written seven of his 16 books since 2000, excels at translating the arcana of economics into language that is both accessible and inviting, all the while making the case for greater equality in the distribution of income and wealth. His success as a communicator is all the more notable given the steady decline of unions and their ability to shape the national dialogue.I asked Fred Ross Jr., a prominent labor activist with Local 1245 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, to describe his friend’s role. “He’s our teacher,” Ross said simply. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is also friends with Reich and shares many of his views, described him in an email as “smart, thoughtful and utterly fearless. Our economy is rigged to work great for those with money and power, while everyone else gets left behind — and Bob is doing everything he can to change that.”Reich’s embrace of the latest communications tools has greatly extended his reach. Several years ago, he began working with Jacob Kornbluth, a Bay Area filmmaker. Reich already had a national following based on his books, his regular radio commentaries for Marketplace and three decades as a public figure. But the medium of online video was a game-changer. Read Part 1 of the Interview“The videos are more successful than I ever expected in terms of reaching people,” Reich said. Kornbluth was equally surprised at the response. “I went to his office and made a video and I put it on my own Facebook page, and hundreds of thousands of people watched it,” he told me, recounting his first project with Reich. “I had never had an experience like it.”Reich and Kornbluth soon formed a nonprofit organization, Inequality Media. In 2015 alone, they produced 25 videos that were viewed more than 25 million times. Most present sober topics in a light-hearted style — how the sharing economy is hurting workers, why deficit hawks are wrong. One, set during a family holiday meal (see below), even features Reich playing two characters: himself, and a Scrooge-like conservative, dubbed “Uncle Bob,” who fires off straw man lines like, “I’m paying too much in taxes to support poor people who are sitting on their duffs.” Reich, framed by a snowflake, then coaches viewers on how to respond to the Uncle Bob in their clans.While Inequality for All is a thoroughly current film, packed with infographics and animation, it is also an engaging history lesson, reflecting Reich’s fascination with how the past informs the present. Any encounter with Reich — via video, book, lecture or interview — will likely reveal his desire to take on America’s notorious amnesia, not merely to set the record straight but to lay the foundation for a reasoned discussion of how we can shape the future.“I have a basic faith that people are rational,” Reich told me. “If you explain something in ways that are not threatening and lace that explanation with enough illustration, example and humor, people at some point can relax and take it in.”The Silicon Valley speech in November was a master class in the art of political communication. Aware that the audience included not only liberal Democrats but also wealthy businesspeople and libertarians, Reich steered clear of any wholesale indictment of tech billionaires – or glorification of government. Instead he offered a measured, non-ideological analysis of how the concentration of economic and political power was endangering everyone’s interests. And, of course, he kept the crowd laughing with lines like, “Economic forecasters exist to make astrologers look good.”After the event I spoke to Jessica and Victor (who declined to give their last names), a married couple in their twenties for whom Reich’s lament about the loss of the American Dream struck a chord. “It’s definitely changed since when I was growing up,” said Jessica, who works at a company that makes medical devices. “My father was an engineer, so we lived a middle-class life, but the kind of wealth that my parents were able to accumulate — I don’t see that happening for my generation anymore.”Victor, who works for a tech firm, talked about the huge disparity he sees between the company executives and low-wage workers like the security officers who guard his building: “People at the top really do not hear the people at the bottom. I see it every day where I work and we need people like Robert going out there and talking about this and making it an issue that everybody’s aware of.""  Those who attended the Silicon Valley event were less homogenous in their views than the capacity audience that turned out the next night at First Congregational Church in Berkeley to hear Reich. It was a home crowd in every way, and Reich, though exhausted at the end of his two-month book tour, clearly was enjoying himself. Speaking without notes, he offered a whirlwind tour of other turbulent periods in American history that spurred momentous change — the Jacksonian era of democratic renewal in the mid-1800s, the early 20th century progressive reform movement, the labor-left social justice crusades of the 1930s.Among those in attendance that evening was Rhiannon Salter, a 28-year-old teacher at Mercy High School, a Catholic girls’ school in the San Francisco suburb of Burlingame. While an undergrad at U.C. Berkeley, Salter took one of Reich’s courses. Now, five years later, she brought with her a dozen students from her economics and advanced placement government and history class.A few weeks later I asked Salter how her students had reacted to Reich’s talk. They loved it, she said, while adding that one of their primary takeaways was that they wouldn’t be able to buy a home in the Bay Area.“One of them turned to me afterward and said, ‘All right, whatever I do, I have to earn a lot of money,’” Salter recalled. “In some ways she’s right, but in another way it’s sad that they have to lose some of their idealism to succeed in this system.”Reich, however, believes there is ample precedent for the country pulling itself back from the brink when capitalism gets out of hand, which is why he presented the Berkeley audience with a highlight reel of American reform movements. This is a major theme of Saving Capitalism, one that was reinforced for Reich during his red state book tour last fall. To his surprise, many of those he met shared his views on the economy, including conservative Republicans and Tea Party members. It turns out they are as fed up with crony capitalism, big banks, hedge fund managers and the influence of corporate money on politics as he and many progressives are.“They call themselves Republicans, but many of the inhabitants of America’s heartland are populists in the tradition of William Jennings Bryan,” wrote Reich in a November blog post.In that same light he views Donald Trump’s popularity as rooted not only in immigrant bashing but in what he believes is a misguided perception that Trump is standing up to the overwhelming economic force of Wall Street in a way that no one else could or would. In doing so, Trump represents to his supporters what Reich calls a “countervailing power” — a person or movement capable of challenging the dominant political structure.Saving Capitalism posits the rise of a new countervailing power (though Trump is not what Reich has in mind) as the way in which our economy, and our country, will ultimately get back on the right track. Reich does not predict what form this will take, though he sees potential in the new variations of labor organizing that have arisen in the last few years, including the national campaign to raise the minimum wage, Fight for 15, and the worker-led organization OUR Walmart. But he is hopeful that what he experienced during his red state travels could portend a political realignment in which liberals and conservatives start to unite around core economic issues.However it occurs, Reich is adamant that a fundamental repositioning can and must occur — not to forestall some apocalyptic endgame but to prevent a slow fragmenting of the nation’s social fabric.“I don’t see a revolution or a kind of political upheaval,” Reich told me. “But I do see capitalism as a political economic system [that] is going to come under increasing strain. I mention in the book that trust begins to disintegrate, that our system depends upon people feeling that it’s fair, that there’s something about the system that works for everybody. The more people begin to think that the game is rigged, the more they are likely to act in ways that undermine the system.”Reich’s response to this possibility is to focus on projects he believes can shift the balance of political power. He has ramped up his longstanding partnership with MoveOn.org, the progressive online advocacy group. This year he and the director Kornbluth made a series of 12 videos called “The Big Picture,” in which Reich presents a set of economic principles and policy ideas (old habits die hard). The videos have been seen by millions of people, according to MoveOn.org campaign director Jo Comerford, who in an interview described Reich as “one of the most prolific people on the planet.”While Reich’s high-volume production won’t convert everyone to his views, Kornbluth said there’s no doubting his motivation. “The integrity of his passion is one of the most inspiring things that I’ve ever been around. It’s genuine. It’s really infectious, too. Very rarely have I seen anybody who is this successful in public who’s also this good of a guy.”Reich would likely disagree with that assessment. There’s a scene in Inequality for All in which he says, “Sometimes I feel like my life has been a complete failure.” During our interview, I asked him if he ever marvels at his own American journey — how the son of a Jewish shopkeeper went on to advise presidents and become the preeminent voice on one of the defining issues of our time. He wasn’t having any of it.“I honestly don’t see it that way,” Reich, who was awarded the Vaclav Havel Vision Foundation Prize in 2003 by the former Czech president for his contributions to world economic and social thought, said in a quiet voice. “I’m more aware of what I haven’t done and haven’t achieved and the very small amount that I’ve contributed to advancing the ball. I say that not out of false modesty. I don’t see a great deal of achievement.”Last month he delivered the winter commencement address at U.C. Berkeley’s Haas Pavilion. The speech was, as usual, sprinkled with humor, but toward the end Reich eschewed levity and left graduates with this advice: “If you’re going to change the world for the better, you’re going to need patience. It is not easy to do. There are going to be setbacks. Change doesn’t come easily. You’ll need to accept what you cannot change, at least right away, and dedicate yourself again and again to changing what you cannot accept.”Read Part 1 of the Interview.Also on HuffPost:"
17,SPORTS,Cleveland Radio Host Spouts Misogynistic Crap After Bills Hire Female Coach,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kathryn-smith-kevin-kiley-radio_us_56a1174be4b076aadcc57fa9,He actually said “there is no place for a woman in professional sports.”,2016-01-21,When J Law got real about why it's so damn hard for women to get what they deserve.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5669adb11300002a00739121.jpeg?cache=3U50cQc2uM&ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"On Wednesday night, the Buffalo Bills made NFL history, announcing that Kathryn Smith will serve as special teams quality control coach next season. The promotion marks the first time ever that a woman has been made a full-time member of an NFL coaching staff -- a fact and feat that should be celebrated and built upon. But on Thursday morning, the glass ceiling that was -- for a moment-- shattered by the promotion was pieced back together, courtesy of Cleveland radio host Kevin Kiley, who condemned the Bills for the move: “There is no place for a woman in professional sports,” he said.Kiley went on to call the hiring “absurd,” describe the person that chose her as an “idiot” and reason that Buffalo made this move simply to “try” to be progressive, while really the team is “heading down the wrong road.”“She couldn’t possibly be qualified to the same level [as] a man,” Kiley added, explaining that while he wouldn’t “mind it as much” if there were female coaches in the NBA or MLB, the very fact that men “have the ability to impose [their] will physically on most people"" (while women, it is implied, do not) makes the former gender the only gender that could truly be worthy of rising through this league’s coaching ranks.Never mind that Smith has worked in NFL teams’ front offices for over a decade, building a career with the New York Jets as a game day/special events intern, as a college scouting intern and as a player personnel assistant before heading north to Buffalo, where she’s served as Rex Ryan’s administrative assistant. But all Smith’s qualifications are -- and always will be, apparently -- dwarfed for Kiley by the simple fact that she’s a woman, and thereby -- inherently, apparently -- doesn’t have what it takes to succeed on the NFL sidelines. Kiley rounded out his rant with a pair of analogies. First, he likened the “absurd” nature of this promotion to the “absurd” idea that women could be qualified to vote for Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees. “Do you want a woman to have a vote on that, who’s never played the game and doesn’t understand,"" he said. When co-host Ken Carman provided the (reasonable, rational, not blatantly bigoted) counterargument that many of the people that currently have that honor are sportswriters, and are thus likely also to have never played the sport at a high level, Kiley responded with a curt, brusque sentence that summed up his entire argument: “But they’re men!” The second analogy went as follows: “If you hired her to take a wheelbarrow full of bricks on a construction site, she’d be put in a position to fail. And the reason would be she’s not suited to do that -- [just like] she’s not suited to advance through the coaching ranks … [That’s] the truth.”That is, he likened the odds of a woman being a good coach to the chances that she could singlehandedly move a load of bricks by herself. What he’s saying is that it’s impossible, that it’s just not going to happen -- and he repeats this over and over, using the phrase “destined to fail” seemingly every other breath.It’s troubling that this even needs to be said in 2016, but there is absolutely no room for this kind of macho fodder in our public dialogues or on our airwaves. There’s no excuse for it and no rationale behind it -- women, like the San Antonio Spurs’ Becky Hammon, have proved themselves more than capable in the sports world. Just ask Gregg Popovich.Kevin Kiley should really sit out this conversation. There is no place for a misogynist in professional sports.Also on HuffPost:"

19,POLITICS,Republican Grail Of A Balanced Budget Slips Further Away As Deficit Climbs,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-balanced-budget_us_569e99dee4b04c813761bd8b,Adopting a GOP budget just got a lot tougher with projections of the first deficit increase since Democrats controlled Congress.,2016-01-20,House Budget Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.) will have to work with Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to pass a budget.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569ec27e1f000050002163fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Congressional Republicans face an uncomfortable reality when they begin drafting a budget blueprint this month: The deficit is rising, and Congress isn't helping.For the first time since 2009, the federal government's deficit will increase in 2016, according to projections released Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office. The government will spend $544 billion more than it takes in this year -- a $105 billion increase in the deficit from 2015, according to the CBO. At the same time, federal spending will increase by more than 20 percent, to $3.9 trillion.But the real challenge for Republican lawmakers looking to use the spending blueprint as a messaging bill is balancing the budget in 10 years. That's the standard Republicans claim to have met in recent budgets -- though Democrats contest that assertion -- and it's a standard that will become much more difficult to meet as the deficit climbs to what the CBO predicts will be $1.4 trillion by 2026.""Republicans are stuck between the tea party wing, which doesn't care about the realities of budgeting as long as they can claim they've reached balance, and a group of moderate Republicans, which still believes there are priorities we have to invest in,"" a Democratic aide familiar with the budget process told The Huffington Post on Tuesday.""The tea party won last year, and it's doubtful that the Republican Party has moved toward responsible governance,"" the aide said.The aide predicted that, instead of acknowledging trouble with trying to balance the budget in 10 years, Republicans would use accounting gimmicks and unrealistic cuts to reach some version of balance. And, with dynamic scoring -- a forecasting process that takes into account the economic impact of legislation -- Republicans probably would claim massive economic growth if a GOP president wins the election and bank the supposed increased tax revenue to get to a balance, the Democratic aide said.""It will be 'yuge,'"" the aide said mockingly, conjuring the image of President Donald Trump magically solving the country's fiscal woes.Of course, Congress has known the deficit is climbing. It's just that the sudden increase makes a balanced budget really difficult. The surging 2016 deficit is the result of a 7 percent increase in mandatory spending, a 3 percent increase in discretionary dollars, and a 14 percent jump in interest payments on debt.Legislation that lawmakers passed this year has only worsened that reality. Back in August, the CBO projected a cumulative deficit of $7 trillion over the 2016-2025 decade. Now, partly as a result of bills passed late in 2015 -- including a tax extenders package attached to the omnibus appropriations bill -- the CBO projects an additional $1.5 trillion in cumulative deficit.These factors are making trouble for budget writers. House Budget Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.) has been emphatic that the House will pass a budget. Senate Budget Chairman Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) sounds less confident about his chamber. But it's unclear whether the GOP budgets will be balanced within the 10-year window.A Budget Committee aide told HuffPost on Tuesday that the committee was still working on the resolution, declining to elaborate. In the past, Republicans have passed budgets that balance in five years, which may actually be easier, given the large deficits on the horizon. But such a budget may be viewed by conservatives as gimmicky.Conservatives seem to be digging in their heels about trimming the 2017 budget number, which was raised in a bipartisan deal in October, to the lower levels of the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration. Cutting the 2017 budget would have the practical effect of getting Republicans to pass appropriations bills at the lower number, which, in turn, probably would prevent Senate Democrats from agreeing to pass appropriations bills on the Senate floor. It would be a return to the same spending standoff that prevented a regular appropriations process last year. And GOP leaders are unlikely to give in on that demand -- especially after repeatedly telling Republicans they were going to pass appropriations bills this year.But if the House Freedom Caucus and its roughly 40 members make the lower budget number an official position, they could put leaders in a tough spot.The Republican budget is unlikely to garner much, if any, Democratic support, so without those conservative votes, GOP leadership may either have to take the lower number or abandon their plan of adopting a budget. And that's assuming that, even with conservative support for the higher number, they could get enough support from the tea party wing -- or from vulnerable moderate Republicans who may not take kindly to things like Medicare and Medicaid cuts in an election year.As Price said on Tuesday, in response to the CBO outlook, ""Our nation has a choice to make.""And as a former senior GOP aide said, in response to the budget challenges presented by the CBO outlook: ""Good luck, Dr. Price."""

Comeback is on, and that the media should get in on the ground floor of this amazing narrative. When will his antagonists learn? Perhaps today! Here's how the comeback is going.As we've documented, much of Jeb Bush's time on the Comeback has been spent battling one of his lower-tier rivals, Florida Senator Marco Rubio. In fact, the Bush campaign has expended so much capital attacking Rubio that GOP elites have felt the need to ask, ""Hey, you know that your presidential campaign needs to be more than just this, right?"" Well, good news, folks: Jeb is finally taking aim at other targets.As Bloomberg's Michael Bender reports, ""Bush’s path back to the top of the polls depends almost exclusively on New Hampshire."" There, Jeb is mired in a pack of candidates struggling to match Donald Trump's polling heights. And he's going in front of audiences who come armed with general skepticism and specific concern over four issues that Bender ably identifies: Bush's support for Common Core, his passion for immigration reform, the hangover from his brother's presidency and Trump's own crafty, crowd-pleasing zingers.But as Bender goes on to relate, Bush came to an event in Hampstead, New Hampshire, armed with unsparing criticisms of his own:By now, Bush knows the list by heart, and even saw fit at the Hampstead rally to volunteer a fifth obstacle to his comeback bid: that he's widely considered a key member of the Republican establishment at at time when the party's voters are seeking change.What? No, no, no, dude, you're not supposed to remind voters of that! What are you --Pause. Deep breath. You know, the Comeback wasn't built in a day, and look, Jeb realizes that it's time to start bringing the heat to Trump. And here's a happy accident: Sarah Palin's endorsement of the reality teevee mogul has come right when he needed a turn of the tide. As Bender's colleague Kendall Breitman reports, Jeb was game to lower the boom:“If someone is looking for a committed conservative, consistently so, that's acted on their core beliefs across the spectrum of conservative policy, I'm their guy,” Bush told Bloomberg's With All Due Respect on Wednesday. “Donald Trump isn't. He's not a conservative. That's laughable. I mean, really?”Good! Nice. I wouldn't have necessary ended it pleading for validation like that, but this is promising. Just stay planted, Jeb. Don't equivocate further. Don't row it back by saying something... Jeb? Jeb! Why are you reaching for that oar, dude?“I admire her commitment to the disabled. I love her passion for -- love for her family and the fact that she's been actively involved in that. I love her pro-life stance,” Bush said.Sigh. Well. That's that, then. You got anything else? Per Jesse Bynes of The Hill:Jeb Bush slams Donald Trump as a ""junkyard dog"" in a new interview, casting his Republican presidential rival as not conservative.Oy, let's just leave bad, bad Leroy Brown out of this.This has been the Jeb!

They need to switch their enormous resources into developing renewable energy, she said, and not just worry about their assets. She noted that fossil fuel reserves already far exceed the carbon budget to avoid the planet warming by 2 degrees Celsius.But Figueres also believes all citizens need to become more thoughtful about their choices, as everything from the food we eat to the clothes we buy affects carbon emissions.""All that has become perilous,"" she said.Even the companies and investors that have been bringing sustainability into the heart of their operations need to step up, she said. ""My father said if things are going badly, continue in the battle, and if things are going well, find another battle,"" she said. ""Everyone has agreed on the direction of travel so the next battle is to speed up along that direction of travel. The strength of Paris is that it builds a broad highway and allows countries to choose their lane of choice. The same is true is for everyone else.""Doug McMillon, the CEO of American multinational retailer Walmart, shared the stage with Figueres. She addressed him at one point, saying, ""Walmart has been in the fast lane for a long time. Now the challenge is moving from the fast lane to the faster lane.""McMillon responded by saying the breadth, not just speed, of change is important, from the way farmers produce agricultural good to the way factories in Walmart's supply chain use energy. Good-quality data is becoming increasingly important in order to monitor what is happening across the company's core operations and its many thousands of suppliers, he added. Better information coming from the increasing use of sensors is allowing the company to understand which factories are most productive, which suppliers offered the best employment terms, and which companies it works with are taking toxins out of their products.More from the World Economic Forum 2016:The Secret To Ending Plastic Waste And Its Devastating Impacts"
