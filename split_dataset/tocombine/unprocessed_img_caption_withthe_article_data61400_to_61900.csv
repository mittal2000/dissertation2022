1,THE WORLDPOST,Why Many Terrorists Are Criminals Before They Turn To Extremism,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brussels-attack-terrorists_us_56f414b7e4b04c4c37618811,A radicalization expert explains what countries can do to stem the violence.,2016-03-24,"This still image taken from a video shows armed Belgian police apprehending a suspect in Molenbeek, Belgium, on March 18.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f4169a1e000087007053d0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. This week, we speak with author Mubin Shaikh on the rise of jihadist groups in the Syrian civil war.At least two of the bombers involved in this week's attacks on Brussels, which killed at least 32 people, had extensive criminal backgrounds: Ibrahim el-Bakraoui and his brother Khalid held multiple convictions between them, including for armed robbery, shooting at police officers and attempted car-jacking.Similarly, some of the people involved in the November terrorist attacks on Paris had previously been convicted of or questioned about a range of crimes.In fact, analysts have found that jihadi terror networks are often populated with criminals and ex-criminals, complicating the conception that their crimes are inspired by ideology alone. This especially has proven to be the case in France and Belgium. The WorldPost spoke with radicalization expert Mubin Shaikh, an ex-counterterrorism operative for the Canadian security services and former extremist, to discuss the relationship between extremism and criminal networks.What role do criminal networks play in radicalization? We can say that the criminality aspect of this is what makes these individuals more susceptible to use violence, because they’re used to using violence.  The overarching thing with criminal networks is, number one: It accustoms you to violence. It makes it easier for you to commit that violence, because you’re used to seeing it, you’re around it. Number two, it allows you to build up a operational capability -- you now have a skillset you can apply to terrorism. Number three, it gives you access to a wider network of people who exhibit those previous two attributes.You will see this in the overwhelming majority of individuals who join ISIS. They are criminals first, and their religion becomes a costume for them.In terms of areas where radicalization can occur and people can be recruited: Can prison act as an environment for radicalization? There’s two sides to that issue of radicalization in prisons. One is, if you look at what’s happened in the term ""radicalization"" -- a lot of people immediately associate that with religion, Muslim radicalization. But radicalization is just a generic term -- it refers to a very human process of people becoming increasingly extreme in their political views, or their ideological frame. So you could say, yes, prisons are a university of radicalization. I mean that in a general sense -- if somebody goes into a prison, is he going to come out more hardened or is he going to come out softer? Right, and that could be of any ideology, whether it’s white supremacy or Islamist terrorism.Exactly, so in that context, prisons are a factory for radicalization. The jihadis themselves say prison is the university of jihad. They say that because you can have intimate networks with people, you can spend time to indoctrinate yourself and you’re not busy with being in the outside world. In that sense, yes, it is.On the other side, when you’re locking up a disproportionately high number of Muslims, that is their common identity. You can be a drug dealer, a robber or whatever, but at the end of the day you have that common identity around which you can unite.That feeds into a kind of perception of in-group among radicals?Yeah, absolutely, it’s a group dynamic aspect of it. At times ideology is a driver of violent extremism, and at other times ideology becomes the passenger while other psychosocial factors become the driver. Those include in-group dynamics, out-group dynamics and marginalization based on discrimination. The prison experience is just another aspect of that.Another thing that has been noted is that there’s a high proportion among terror attacks of people with close family ties. What role do peers and family members play in radicalization?Marc Sageman did a lot of study on this, and his argument was that it’s not ideology that drives these people but kinship. It’s not what you know but who you know. So that’s one side of it. A lot of research does indicate that a lot of these people do get involved because of family ties, peers and kinship.The other thing is operational security. A brother is not going to inform on another brother; a sister on a brother; or a mother on a son. Cohesion -- that you trust your brother, you love your brother -- is very useful for those purposes.What can security service do to better counter radicalization and violent extremism? Particularly speaking about North American and European security services.I see it in two ways. One is that you need to have strong human intelligence. Human intelligence is key, and when doing so, framing it in a way that gives those human intelligence services a sense of meaning. A sense that you’re actually doing something good, and you’re defending your faith from people who are failing your religion. This was the narrative they got me on, in that sense. Another is NGO-based intervention. An intelligence guy can’t talk to an at-risk youth, because he is the enemy as far as they’re concerned. But NGOs that have training in mental health and educational or economic support can intervene when they see a troubled youth and give them an alternative.Is there any country attempting something like that and showing signs of success?Yeah, there are a number of countries that have been doing this for some time now. In Denmark, they’ve been doing that. The Nordic countries also have a very particular approach that is very heavy on this. When their intelligence services pick up some guys, what they’ll tell them is, ""You should go talk to such-and-such imam, or this community organization."" This shows that they’re not just about locking people up and throwing away the key -- they actually want to help.In North America, it’s really just Canada -- where a lot of community interventions are being done quietly. The U.S. is still not on point yet on that. It’s starting, and there are some cases where there are imams who are talking to people, but it’s still not developed to the level it needs to be.Any final thoughts in general on this you’d like to add?I would say that right now what people are starting to agree on is the need for the use of former extremists, reformed extremists who have been there and done that. The equivalent of this is found in Germany, where they have the exit program for white supremacists, and a lot of them use ex-white supremacists.The principles are exactly the same -- correcting the ideology, correcting the worldview and offering psychosocial support.

Fans of the beautiful game flock to consume and revel in the year-to-year brilliance of Barcelona's soccer, a club adorned with a dizzying amount of trophies, legends past and present, and above all, Lionel Messi.But to understand how Barcelona became the most beloved, powerful and successful soccer club on the planet, one only has to trace its successes back to the influence of one man: Dutch soccer player Johan Cruyff, who died on Thursday from cancer at 68 years old. Since the turn of the 20th century, the globalization of soccer knowledge, furthered by advances in communication technology and ease of travel, has exponentially spread with each passing decade. It's how a German soccer great ends up as the U.S. men's national team coach. And more incisively, it's how Cruyff, a Dutchman from Amsterdam, laid the groundwork for Barcelona-as-we-know-it, and more broadly, how modern soccer is played, from Spain to California to Japan. As a star attacker for Ajax Amsterdam during the '60s and '70s, Cruyff acted as the on-field brain of coach Rinus Michels' very, very basic concept: for the team to work well together. Born out of this simple philosophy, totaalvoetbal or ""Total Football"" burst onto the international soccer scene.This devastating trick, known as the ""Cruyff Turn"" is often the one of the first moves young soccer players attempt to master.Specifically, the revolutionary strategy required each outfield player to be versatile enough to shift into any position on the field -- to become amorphous as the flow of the match dictated. If Cruyff, an attacker, found himself in a position to defend, out of necessity, he'd take up that position, and instinctively, a teammate would move into his vacated position. Using total football, Ajax won three consecutive European Cups (1971, 1972, 1973), and the Cruyff-lead Dutch national team, by then dubbed ""Clockwork Orange,"" made the World Cup Finals in 1974 and 1978, only to be upset in both tournaments. But the metaphysical soccer revolution was already underway. Backed by tangible successes and crowd-pleasing displays, the style was a massive departure from the popular strategy of the '60s, Italy's catenaccio calcio, which rigidly had each player man-mark their opponent in defense-first, grind-it-out matches. Cruyff, forever a proponent of entertaining, attacking soccer, was emphatic in his opposition to these tactics, even once saying, ""I much prefer to win 5-4 than 1-0.”Cruyff's Ajax teams disrupted the zeitgeist and pushed soccer into a free-flowing, aesthetically brilliant passing-intensive display of teamwork, sacrifice and technique. Looks familiar, eh?Barcelona's attackers combine in a mesmerising sequence for a goal against Real Betis in December 2015.In the summer of 1973, Barcelona bought Cruyff from Ajax for $2 million -- a world record transfer fee at the time. At Barcelona, he named his son a Catalan name, Jordi, while on his way to leading Barcelona to its first La Liga title since 1960 and winning the 1974 European Football of the Year award. According to soccer historian Jimmy Burns, ""with Cruyff, the team felt they couldn’t lose."" His impact, however, was fully felt when he returned to manage Barcelona in 1988. There, he laid the groundwork for the next stage of total football: ""tiki-taka,"" a pass-and-move strategy so patient and hypnotic, but also so difficult to execute, that it required homegrown talent to run it.  This famous Cruyff goal against Atletico Madrid has been dubbed the ""phantom goal"" or the ""impossible goal."" How'd he score that? Who knows. As a Barcelona player in 1979, he had the club renovate an old farmhouse into Barcelona's now-famed La Masia academy, which begins developing players as young as six-years-old. Upon his return as manager nearly a decade later, he overhauled La Masia, allowing shorter players -- those thought to be too weak for the demands of professional soccer -- to stick around, so long as they possessed prodigious technique and expert knowledge of Cruyff's teachings. Without that change in policy, players like Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi would've never become who they are today. In any other academy, they would've been cut. Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four straight La Liga titles from 1990-1994 and one European Cup in 1992. After leaving the post in 1996, every Barcelona manager since -- including Bobby Robson, Louis van Gaal, Frank Rijkaard, and most famously, Pep Guardiola -- has carried Cruyff's torch. One can even point to Arsenal's Arsene Wenger as another disciple of Cruyff's approach. These extremely successful managers are all Cruyff's progeny.“Johan Cruyff painted the chapel, and Barcelona coaches since merely restore or improve it,"" Guardiola once said, according to the Guardian. The Spanish national team, full of Barcelona players, execute Cruyff's vision match after match, and 40 years since the inception of total football, it's stood the test of time; Spain won back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012 and the 2010 World Cup, marking an unprecedented four-year run of dominance in international soccer. Without Cruyff, soccer would probably have still advanced -- the early 20th-century work of English coach Jimmy Hogan began what Cruyff eventually seized total understanding off -- but not in such an ingenious, wonderful way.Johan Cruyff fast-forwarded soccer into the future, and it's been operating at light-speed ever since.

But now she's using her skills in hopes of making a splash on the Olympic scene. Yusra Mardini, an 18-year-old Syrian refugee who fled Damascus with her sister last year, endured hours swimming in the Aegean Sea after the boat she was on began to fill with water.The teen, who has been training as a swimmer for about a decade, eventually found safety in Germany, along with her family. Now she's looking for a spot on an Olympic team made up of refugees, in order to compete at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.“I want to show everybody that it’s hard to arrive at your dreams but it’s not impossible,"" Mardini, who wants to compete in the 200 meter freestyle event, said in a statement. ""You can do it; everyone can do it if I can do it, any athlete can do it.”According to TakePart, the teen's path to safety was a brutal one. During the attempt to make the passage to Lesbos, Greece, the motor of the boat carrying Mardini and others stopped working. The teen was one of three swimmers on the boat, which was carrying 20 refugees. The trio jumped in the water to push the boat to Greek land. “We were [swimming] in the water for three-and-a-half hours until we got to Greece. It was really horrible,” Mardini told the outlet. “I couldn’t see anything, I wear glasses. The trip was a straight line. We could see the island, but never reach it.”After 25 days of travel, which included a six-hour trek through a cornfield and even running away after getting arrested by Serbian police, she made it to Berlin with her sister, where she reunited with her family, TakePart reported. Since then, Mardini, along with 43 others, has been vying for a spot on the Refugee Olympic Athletes team, which was created by the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee in early March. Ultimately, there will only be about five to 10 places on the team available, the release noted. In about two months, the swimmer will find out if she's made the team. For now, she has more work to do. In order to meet the B standard of the International Swimming Federation and possibly qualify for the Games, she faces the task of cutting her personal best time down by a few seconds,TakePart reported. And whatever the future has in store for the teen, one thing is certain -- Mardini is not a quitter. ""I think even if I fail I will try again,"" she said in the press release. ""Maybe I will be sad but I will not show it, but I will try again and again until I get it."""

If he'd taken less than a majority, the delegates would have been allocated proportionally to candidates winning more than 15 percent.Pre-election polling showed Cruz far outpacing his rivals, but his path to a clear majority was made more difficult by Kasich, who campaigned vigorously in the state.In many ways, Utah represented an ideal battleground for Cruz. Rather than holding a primary, as it has in past years, the state switched to a caucus format, which was conducted in part using online voting. Caucuses have tended to favor the Cruz campaign's ability to turn out voters. Most of his previous wins came in caucus states, including Iowa, Alaska, Kansas and Maine.Also benefiting Cruz was Utah's many Mormon voters, who tend to favor both more temperate discourse and moderate immigration policies. Members of the religion are considerably more supportive of a path to citizenship than most Republicans.Mormons are also wary of Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints formally, if implicitly, denounced his call to bar Muslims from entering the country, issuing a statement in December about the importance of religious freedom and pluralism.As BuzzFeed's McKay Coppins notes, Mormons differ with Trump in a number of other ways:Trump is off-putting to Mormons for more predictable reasons as well. His blatant religious illiteracy, his penchant for onstage cursing, his habit of flinging crude insults at women, his less-than-virtuous personal life and widely chronicled marital failures — all of this is anathema to the wholesome, family-first lifestyle that Mormonism promotes. And demographically speaking, Mormons tend to reside outside Trump’s base of support anyway. They have higher-than-average education levels, whereas Trump does best among voters without any college education; they are more likely to be weekly churchgoers, while Trump performs better with Christians who attend services infrequently.Cruz won the support of much of the state's GOP political establishment, including endorsements from Sen. Mike Lee and Gov. Gary Herbert.Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, said he personally planned to vote for Cruz, although he stopped short of making an official endorsement.""This week, in the Utah nominating caucus, I will vote for Senator Ted Cruz,"" Romney wrote last week in a Facebook post. ""Today, there is a contest between Trumpism and Republicanism. Through the calculated statements of its leader, Trumpism has become associated with racism, misogyny, bigotry, xenophobia, vulgarity and, most recently, threats and violence. I am repulsed by each and every one of these. The only path that remains to nominate a Republican rather than Mr. Trump is to have an open convention. At this stage, the only way we can reach an open convention is for Senator Cruz to be successful in as many of the remaining nominating elections as possible."""

Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s positive campaign could win over voters -- if they notice it. And Republicans aren’t changing their minds about Trump. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, March 23, 2016. CAN TRUMP CAPITALIZE ON ANTI-MUSLIM SENTIMENT? - Nate Silver: ""Trump would 'close up our borders' in response to Brussels, he said...We might expect more rhetoric along these lines from Trump because the Paris and San Bernardino attacks appeared to boost his standing in national opinion polls, as well as the amount of media attention he received…. [T]he Paris and San Bernardino attacks were associated with an uptick in Trump’s numbers. According to our high-sensitivity polling average, Trump improved from 28 percent of the vote just before the Paris attacks to 32 percent on Dec. 1, the day before the San Bernardino attacks. His numbers then rose further, to about 35 percent by mid-December."" [538] Trump wasn't the only candidate to rise in the polls - Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who’s staked his campaign less heavily on anti-Muslim rhetoric, also climbed in the polls in the same time period. Both candidates seem to have benefited from retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson’s collapse in the polls during that time. After the Paris attacks,Trump rose 4.8 percent in the HuffPost Pollster national GOP average and continued to rise throughout December. But Cruz also rose 3.3 percentage points and followed a similar trajectory. Both had already begun climbing since about the time Carson started dropping after a series of bad debate performances. Trump may well have benefitted from his tough stance, but it’s also possible he and Cruz were picking up Carson supporters.Clinton most trusted on terrorism - HuffPollster: ""It’s too early to tell where public opinion will land after the latest bombings, but polls conducted since the Paris attack in November….show Americans tend to trust Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton more than other presidential candidates to handle [terrorism]....An ABC News/Washington Post poll in early March forced respondents to pick between the two presidential front-runners on who they think is best able to handle an international crisis and terrorism. Americans chose Clinton over Trump by a 29-point margin (61 percent to 32 percent) for an international crisis, and picked Clinton by a 14-point margin as the best to handle terrorism….According to exit polls from primary states that have already voted, Republicans placed the most faith — an average of 32 percent — in Trump to handle an international crisis."" [HuffPost] WESTERN CONTESTS PLAY OUT AS ANTICIPATED - The votes aren’t all counted as of publication time, but primaries in Arizona and caucuses in Utah and Idaho have all been called for the winners. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton won Arizona by a nearly 20-point margin. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders grabbed wins in Idaho and Utah, where it looks like he’ll end up with at least 50 point margins over Clinton. On the GOP side, Trump secured all of the delegates in the winner-take-all Arizona primary, beating Cruz by around 20 percentage points. But Cruz will win all of the delegates in the Utah caucus, where he finished well above the 50 percent winner-take-all threshold. The delegate race remains mostly the same for both parties after these contests: Clinton has a big lead over Sanders, and Trump still has a substantial lead over Cruz. [HuffPost]KASICH’S POSITIVE OUTLOOK COULD HELP HIM, IF HE GETS THE MESSAGE OUT - Lynn Vavreck - ""His campaign has a notably positive tone and although Mr. Kasich trails his opponents in the delegate count, he continues to campaign mainly on empowerment and experience—and there’s some evidence that people like it….[In]a virtual focus group….roughly 1,000 people were divided into four groups to watch and react to two political ads in real time.….Mr. Kasich’s ad left people somewhat happier and hopeful—and didn’t worry or anger them as much as Mr. Trump’s. They rated Mr. Kasich’s ad 10-points above the 'average political ad' in overall quality while placing Mr. Trump’s ad 5-points below the average ad…..On average, people rated Mr. Kasich’s ad as making them happy and hopeful—and as being higher in overall quality—and there’s some evidence to suggest that despite saying Mr. Trump’s ad was more memorable, Mr. Kasich’s empowering message moved people: among people who saw both ads relative to those who saw no ads at all, people increased their favorable ratings of Mr. Kasich by 11 points; Mr. Trump’s favorability, however, only increased by 3 points."" [Princeton University] Trump is still viewed favorably among Republicans - Frank Newport: ""Republicans nationwide remain more positive than negative in their views of Donald Trump, with 55% viewing him favorably and 41% unfavorably so far in March. Despite Trump's extraordinary journey since last summer as the central -- and controversial -- focus of the 2016 election, Republicans' views of the billionaire businessman have generally held steady. His image today is roughly where it was last July….Since Trump's favorable rating peaked at 61% in January, it has been lower each of the past two months. But from a broad perspective, the month-to-month changes have been relatively minor. The relative stability in Trump's favorable percentage -- ranging between 54% and 61% -- shows that his supporters are fairly locked into their support and are not dramatically affected by what Trump says or does, or by what the media and rival candidates say about him. On a comparative basis, Trump's popularity among Republicans is roughly similar to where Mitt Romney was in February 2012 (59% favorable, 31% unfavorable)."" [Gallup] Economic struggles and racial resentment both independently factor into Trump support - Max Ehrenfreund and Scott Clement: “The Post found that both economic troubles and feelings that whites are losing out have a strong – and independent – impact on Trump’s supporters….The analysis took both factors into account, and also controlled for demographics, income and political ideology….The odds that a person who feels strongly that whites are losing out supports Trump are more than three times higher than for a demographically and financially similar person who feels blacks or Hispanics are losing out or that neither group is losing out more. Likewise, the odds a person who says he or she is struggling financially supports Trump are about twice as high as someone who says he or she is comfortable or moving up economically.” [WashPost] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Despite the government's effort to reduce carbon emissions in tribal areas, oil and gas extraction remains a major source of revenue and employment in many American Indian communities. ""There will be always extraction of oil and gas on Indian lands,"" Tyson Running Wolf, tribal secretary for the Blackfeet Nation in Montana, told The Huffington Post. While the Blackfeet are not a part of the clean energy project, two other tribes in Montana -- the Crow and Chippewa Cree -- did receive portions of the funding. Running Wolf and other Blackfeet leaders fought for decades to stop oil and gas drilling at the Badger-Two Medicine area, land sacred to the tribe near Glacier National Park. Under pressure from tribal members, last week President Barack Obama canceled an oil drilling lease belonging to Louisiana-based oil company Solenex that would have allowed it to drill in the area. ""We are opposed to development in Badger-Two Medicine. We hold that place to be sacred,"" Running Wolf said. ""But we're not opposed to oil and gas development on the Blackfeet reservation.""The Blackfeet and other tribes see exploiting fossil fuel reserves on their land as vital to their economic development.""We rely on coal just as [other tribes] rely on salmon,"" CJ Stewart, a senator of the Crow Nation, told HuffPost in an 2014 interview. ""All tribes share one common enemy, and that enemy is poverty.”For years, oil and gas drilling was a boon to tribal communities near the Bakken oil fields in Montana and North Dakota. The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara tribes at the Fort Berthold reservation in North Dakota collected about $1 billion in oil and gas revenue between 2008 and 2014.But hasty development and plummeting oil prices turned the oil and gas boom into a painful bust for some tribes. Fossil fuel extraction also comes with environmental risks -- especially oil and chemical spills -- and accelerates climate change. Tribal communities in the U.S. are particularly vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate. They tend to be restricted by reservation boundaries and have high rates of poverty and unemployment. Poverty and relative immobility make it difficult for groups to relocate to avoid effects of climate change, such as drought. For some tribes, including the Blackfeet, shifting to renewables might make economic and environmental sense, Running Wolf said. But if oil prices go up, he added, his tribe would not hesitate to extract its untapped oil reserves. ""We would tap into it if it came down to it,"" Running Wolf said. ""We have to do something for our economic development."""

The island has an unemployment rate of over 12 percent.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f1b7c81500002a000b2e2c.jpeg?cache=4WokuwqcsQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Puerto Rico had a good day, or at least a hopeful one, in court on Tuesday.The Supreme Court seemed receptive to Puerto Rico’s argument that it has the power to enact bankruptcy protections for its public entities, including its cash-strapped utilities. The sympathetic hearing suggests the financially beleaguered commonwealth may gain one more tool, however modest, in its efforts to reduce a debt burden of over $70 billion.There's another factor that may weigh in Puerto Rico's favor: The case is being heard by a Supreme Court in which the liberals outnumber the conservatives. The currently eight-member court lost one more judge when Justice Samuel Alito recused himself -- possibly because he and/or his wife have investments in a fund that is a major holder of Puerto Rican utility company debt.And the liberals clearly dominated the hearing. With the exception of a few questions from Chief Justice John Roberts, the three conservative justices on the bench did not speak at all.The dispute centers on the Recovery Act, a 2014 Puerto Rico law that aimed to create a special bankruptcy process for certain public corporations, including the island's three main public utilities. Those utilities owe a combined $20 billion. The largest, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, owes $9 billion just by itself.The ability to restructure their debt would benefit those companies -- and possibly their customers, the residents of Puerto Rico -- but their creditors would face significant losses. That concern drove a group of major creditors to sue to stop the law from taking effect.BlueMountain Capital Management and funds managed by Franklin Advisers and OppenheimerFunds successfully argued in the lower courts that federal bankruptcy law’s pre-emption of state law applies to Puerto Rican law as well. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code prohibits states from establishing their own bankruptcy laws that would “bind a creditor that does not consent.”Critically for this case, however, the states do have the ability to extend federal bankruptcy protections under Chapter 9 to their municipalities -- that is, cities, towns, school districts, municipal utilities, etc. Puerto Rico contends that it is not subject to the overall prohibition on enacting state bankruptcy protections because it's not a state. It points to a 1984 federal law, which denies the commonwealth the ability to let its municipalities seek Chapter 9 protection -- the very ability that states have. If Puerto Rico is not a ""state"" there, the argument goes, then it's not a state for the rest of Chapter 9 -- which happens to include the provision preventing states from writing their own binding bankruptcy laws.The creditors counter that Chapter 1 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code clearly establishes that the term “‘State’ includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9.” Thus, while Puerto Rico is not a state for purposes of defining when its municipalities ""may be a debtor,"" the creditors argue that federal law still considers it a state when it comes to prohibiting states from writing their own bankruptcy laws.On Tuesday, Puerto Rico’s lead attorney, Christopher Landau, insisted that a state's ""only role"" under Chapter 9 is to extend bankruptcy protections to municipalities. Therefore, he said, the exception laid out in Chapter 1 is “just another way of saying Puerto Rico is outside the scope of Chapter 9” entirely.The liberal justices initially seemed skeptical of that interpretation.At one point, under persistent questioning from Justice Stephen Breyer, Landau reminded Breyer that the justice has “always been sensitive"" to the kind of argument he was making.“That may be, but I can't say that an ‘airplane’ means a horse,” Breyer interjected, prompting laughter throughout the chamber.But as the time wore on, Breyer and his Democratic-appointed fellows seemed to find Landau’s arguments more compelling.Justice Elena Kagan noted more than once that while she had not initially been persuaded by Puerto Rico's case, Landau's elucidation at oral argument helped her to understand it.Kagan pressed the creditors' lawyer, Matthew McGill, to rebut Puerto Rico’s point -- which she described as “once you're not eligible for Chapter 9, none of the provisions of Chapter 9 apply to you.”“The fundamental fallacy of the argument is that the 'gateway' requirement [that an entity be a state in order to extend Chapter 9 protections] somehow excludes you from the scope of Chapter 9 entirely,” McGill said.Breyer was not satisfied with that response, suggesting that it does not require one to “play games with words” to see that Chapter 9 is directed at those entities that have the power to utilize federal bankruptcy protections -- which is to say, states.Although everybody seemed to agree that Congress’ intentions in passing that 1984 law were murky at best, the liberal justices appeared to find it curious that Congress would have deliberately left Puerto Rico without any method for discharging government debts, short of an act of Congress.“Why would Congress put Puerto Rico in this never­-never land”? Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked.The elephant in the room was the Puerto Rican financial and economic crisis, which grows more severe by the day. The Puerto Rican government has maintained that the commonwealth cannot pay its debts and that it is reaching the limits of what it can reasonably ask its people to sacrifice. It has already resorted to austerity measures in the form of spending cuts and tax increases, which have effectively left the island stuck in a prolonged recession.As a result, Puerto Rico has been experiencing population loss since 2005, including a net migration of 64,000 people to the U.S. mainland in 2014 alone. The Treasury Department estimates that the island's 3.5 million population has declined 10 percent in the past decade.This is the second time this year that Puerto Rico, represented by Landau, has pleaded for the Supreme Court to recognize its right to decide something for itself. The island has apparently placed its hopes for relief in the judiciary after years of requests for congressional action went unanswered.The Obama administration is still pushing Congress for legislation that would grant Puerto Rico power to restructure its debts and establish a financial oversight board to ensure the commonwealth makes fiscal reforms. The Treasury Department has argued that extending Chapter 9 authority would not be enough, since it would allow the island to restructure only $20 billion out of its $70 billion debt.A bill being drafted by House Republicans would create somewhat stricter hurdles for restructuring than the White House has set forth and ultimately would leave those decisions to the discretion of the oversight board.Landau used the final portion of his argument time on Tuesday to remind the justices that “this is also a flesh-­and­-blood situation in Puerto Rico.”“To say that [the law] precludes Puerto Rico from dealing in any way with the financial crisis for its public utilities, which … provide basic services like electricity and water to its people -- that's the question: whether people in a village in Puerto Rico will be able to get clean water,” he said.A decision in Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust is expected sometime before the end of June."

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to fund lead testing at schools in the wake of the Flint water crisis.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f2fa141500002a000b3072.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In the wake of the toxic water crisis in Flint, Michigan, lawmakers in other parts of the country are looking ahead in an effort to stop similar disasters in other communities.New York and New Jersey lawmakers in particular are scrambling to introduce legislation that would help public schools test for lead in their water, as a number of cases have recently been reported in those states.Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have introduced companion bills in the House and the Senate to fund lead testing at schools and day care centers. Meanwhile, Rep. Donald Payne Jr. (D-N.J.) has introduced legislation that would require states that receive federal funding to help public schools establish programs for lead testing. Federal law currently doesn't require lead testing at most U.S. schools.“From Flint to Newark we have seen how critical it is to protect our children from drinking contaminated water,"" Pascrell said Wednesday in a statement provided to The Huffington Post. ""All Americans, and especially kids in our schools and childcare facilities, deserve access to clean water. Our job is to make it easier for the facilities to conduct needed testing by providing funding sources. Exposure at any level is unacceptable.""All three lawmakers have watched as high levels of lead were discovered at schools in their own backyards. In Newark, New Jersey, 30 public schools had their water shut off earlier this month due to elevated levels of lead, prompting city officials to warn students and faculty, ""Don't drink the water.""Payne, the primary representative for Newark, wants to require any school built after 1996 to test for lead in drinking water biannually. His bill, which would update the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, would also require that parents be notified within 48 hours if lead is found to exceed the action level set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.""As a parent, I want to know that my children are drinking lead-free water, and I want other families to know that about their own children, too,"" Payne said. When 60 lead samples from two schools in Ithaca, New York, tested positive for high levels of lead in late February, the issue hit home for Schumer. On a conference call with reporters Wednesday morning, he said the first priority should be to keep children’s drinking water safe when they are at school.“It’s disturbing that Flint may have been just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to toxic lead in our kids’ drinking water -- and the lead contamination in Ithaca, New York, only underscores this concern,"" Schumer said. ""Right now there is a yawning gap in our lead-testing protocols. At the federal level, we do not require or support lead testing in schools.""The legislation authored by Pascrell and Schumer would create a $100 million federal grant program through the EPA that would help school districts and child care centers test their drinking water for potential lead contamination.Pascrell, a former mayor of Paterson, New Jersey -- like Newark, an urban environment with large communities of color -- said he understands the need for resources and funding to encourage communities to take steps to protect their drinking water.By forming an annual grant program, the legislation would give schools an incentive to apply for federal funding in consecutive years. If a school district doesn't apply for or receive funding in a given year, it can apply the following year.""Giving schools the resources to test the quality of kids’ drinking water is the right and safe thing to do because lead poisoning is easily prevented -- and because the effects of lead poisoning on our children’s bodies and brains is catastrophic and irreversible,"" Schumer said.

""At this point, we want to make sure he’s OK and that he can get down from the tree without hurting himself or someone else.

Trump defeated Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Trump's victory in Arizona, a winner-take-all primary state, puts him 58 delegates closer to the 1,237 needed to secure the nomination for president.Trump's campaigning in Arizona, like elsewhere in the country, was marked by violence and protests at rallies. Protesters blocked the road to one of his events on Saturday. Later that day, a man punched and kicked a protester at a Trump rally. Trump consistently led in the polls in Arizona since declaring his bid last summer. He made border security key to his message -- an issue that hits closer to home for Arizonans than it does for the many GOP voters who applauded the message far from the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump said he would build a wall along the southwest border of the U.S. and deport all undocumented immigrants, although the ""good ones"" could come back. His message is one that resonated with Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, a law enforcement official infamous for his “tent city” jail, where inmates are intentionally humiliated, as well as his controversial raid tactics and rhetoric against undocumented immigrants. Arpaio endorsed Trump in January.Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R), who signed the state's 2010 law aimed at driving out undocumented people, also endorsed Trump.Arizona's GOP primary is open only to registered Republicans, making it impossible for registered independents or Democrats to cast a ballot. Some speculated that would create an opening for Cruz, who would be less likely than Trump to attract the votes of people outside the Republican Party. Although the immigration messages of Trump and Cruz were apparently successful in the primary, the state has also given victories to politicians with a more moderate stance on the issue. Its current U.S. senators, Republicans John McCain and Jeff Flake, made up half of the GOP side of the ""gang of eight"" that drafted a comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013. Neither senator is a fan of Trump, although neither has gone so far as to say he would not support Trump in a general election. Flake visited a mosque in December, after Trump called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, and recently said ""it would be very difficult to support Donald Trump."" ""It's a concern to have Trump on the top of the ticket. It's a concern for anyone on the ballot,"" Flake said earlier this month, according to CNN. ""Some of us feel we have a responsibility to speak out when he makes outlandish, crazy statements like the Muslim ban or a number of others.""McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, said earlier this month that he shares ""the concerns about Donald Trump"" voiced by 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, particularly on national security. McCain has said he would not endorse a candidate in the Republican primary. ""I want Republican voters to pay close attention to what our party's most respected and knowledgeable leaders and national security experts are saying about Mr. Trump, and to think long and hard about who they want to be our next Commander-in-Chief and leader of the free world,"" he said in a statement in early May.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
17,HEALTHY LIVING,Untreated Sleep Apnea Makes Truck Drivers 5 Times As Likely To Crash,Krithika Varagur,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/untreated-sleep-apnea-truck-drivers-crash_us_56f173cbe4b084c67221974b,"""It's really key for the public to weigh in on this,"" says one researcher.",2016-03-23,New findings from the Harvard School of Public Health reveal that sleep apnea among truck drivers is a major public health issue.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f316171e0000b30070529a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You probably know that things like alcohol, vision problems and texting are all risk factors for traffic accidents. But what about the seemingly innocuous condition of sleep apnea? Obstructive sleep apnea is a chronic disorder in which a person experiences pauses in breathing during the night, leading to poor sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. It affects at least 25 million adults in the U.S., including more than 20 percent of commercial truck drivers, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The daytime sleepiness caused by OSA can make for dangerously fatigued drivers. Drowsy driving (from numerous causes, including OSA) is a factor in 328,000 crashes each year. Drowsy truck driving, in particular, has been linked to a number of deadly accidents, like the infamous crash that injured Tracy Morgan in 2014 when a truck driver who had been up for 28 hours collided with Morgan's limousine. New findings from the Harvard School of Public Health reveal that sleep apnea among truck drivers is a major public health issue. In a study released this week, which looked at over 3,600 truck drivers, researchers found that drivers with untreated sleep apnea were five times as likely to get into preventable crashes as drivers without the condition. ""We were directly responding to the lack of data about sleep apnea directly related to commercial drivers,"" Stefanos Kales, an author of the study, told The Huffington Post. ""Regulating sleep apnea in commercial drivers has been surprisingly controversial, but we hope this data makes the risks clear.""The study compared drivers with obstructive sleep apnea to drivers without the condition, from 2006 to 2010. Among the drivers with OSA, some were treating it with a pressurized-air device called APAP, and some left it untreated. The APAP devices contained chips that allowed the researchers to see how frequently they were being used, Kales said, so the data was collected automatically, rather than from self-reports. While those who left the OSA untreated had the worst crash rate, Kales said that those who regularly treated their condition with APAP devices performed as well as the OSA-free control group. This suggests that more and consistent treatment should be a priority for truck drivers, Kales said. But while sleep groups and the public can agree that drowsy truck driving is a serious issue, it's stopped short of being addressed in legislation. That's changing. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Transportation took the first official step to address sleep apnea in commercial drivers: it announced plans to legislate the issue soon, and invited the public to submit research and suggestions.The regulation of truck drivers' hours has been controversial in recent years. As of 2014, Congress was still pushing for longer hours for truck drivers. The public can currently submit input on the best way to address sleep apnea in people who drive commercial trucks and conduct trains. Kales said it is in Americans' public interest to speak out during the 90-day comment period issued by the Department of Transportation. ""It's really key for the public to weigh in on this. Drowsy driving kills thousands of people every year. This is not just an issue for the trucking industry,"" he said.To submit a comment online, head to regulations.gov."
18,POLITICS,A Contested Convention Won't Fix The GOP,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-contested-convention-poll_us_56f30908e4b0c3ef5217d8e5,"Republican voters may not love their candidates, but they're not pining for an alternative.",2016-03-23,Republican voters won't be overwhelmingly happy to see any of these guys win the nomination.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f3097a1500002a000b308a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Political conventions are meant to be unifying events, rallying voters around their party and their presidential nominee ahead of the general election.If the GOP primary ends in a contested convention, though, pretty much any possible outcome will leave a sizable chunk of the party dispirited.It's not just that front-runner Donald Trump is startlingly unpopular for a leading candidate, with nearly half of voters in many state primaries saying they'd be unsatisfied to see him elected. If Trump fails to collect the 1,237 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination outright, he may actually be the least-divisive option for the party.The alternatives, which involve the party coalescing around Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ohio Gov. John Kasich, or a yet-to-be-named dark horse, risk giving the appearance of party elites overriding the will of the electorate. That may be even more toxic than polarizing candidates in a campaign notable for hostility to the establishment. In a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, 52 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say that if Trump falls short of a majority of delegates, they'd still prefer to see him chosen as the nominee. A combined 39 percent would rather see Cruz or Kasich selected, while just 4 percent want to see somebody else get the nomination.Those varying preferences aren't necessarily a sign of a divided party. Most Democrats, for example, say they'd be happy to see either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders elected. But just 40 percent of GOP voters say they'd be enthusiastic about Trump winning. That actually makes Trump the consensus candidate, with fewer than 30 percent of GOP voters saying they'd be enthusiastic about any scenario that wasn't a Trump nomination. Cruz's nomination would be the second-least divisive option, with a bare majority of voters saying they'd feel positively if he were chosen. But Kasich, whose viability rests on his ability to win a contested convention, garners almost no enthusiasm. Just 8 percent of GOP voters would be enthusiastic if Kasich were chosen, with fewer than a third saying they'd be at least satisfied with that outcome. The majority, 61 percent, would be dissatisfied or upset. One possibility, despite widespread speculation, is even more deeply unpopular: bringing in a last-minute savior, like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Just 4 percent of GOP voters say they'd prefer to see a new candidate chosen as the nominee, and just 16 percent would be satisfied with such an outcome. The vast majority, 55 percent, say they'd be outright upset.Until any of those scenarios shake out, it's hard to say what they'd mean for the GOP's general election chances. Nominees tend to get a boost once they're officially crowned, and even unhappy Republicans may be willing to rally around whoever is chosen if the alternative is losing the White House to a Democrat. But a contested convention is unlikely to convince the GOP's increasingly unhappy electorate that the party is headed in the right direction.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 18 to March 21 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f17a77150000ad000b2d9e.jpeg?cache=0JxvD3Sc92&ops=crop_17_92_2983_1327%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The Republican elite is struggling to understand why so many of its core supporters have abandoned them for an authoritarian demagogue. After decades of cozy cohabitation, the plebes are moving out, leaving the cufflink wing of the party to wonder what went wrong. Last week, the leading journal of elite conservative opinion presented a blunt, honest and unapologetic answer: Republican intellectuals loathe the rabble. ""The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture,"" writes Kevin D. Williamson, one of several vocal Trump critics on staff at National Review. Williamson assails in scoffing prose what he calls the ""immoral"" ""lie"" of the current political moment. Specifically, ""that the white working class that finds itself attracted to Trump has been victimized by outside forces. It hasn't.""Surveying rust-belt desolation in upstate New York, Williamson concludes: ""Nobody did this to them. They failed themselves."" Liberal writers are reveling in Williamson's straightforward poverty-shaming (which his colleague David French defended). The New Republic's Jeet Heer sees the piece as a return to National Review's founding ""aristocratic conservatism,"" which has more recently been ""obscured by a populist mask."" For Jonathan Chait, Williamson is exposing the perverse moral logic of hardline libertarianism. ""The marketplace hasn’t failed the white working class,"" he mocks. ""The white working class has failed capitalism.""They could go further. Republican elites have relied on such ideas for years. In the depths of the Great Recession, Paul Ryan worried that the social safety net was becoming ""a hammock that lulls able-bodied people to lives of dependency."" Unemployment had spiked not because of a financial crisis, but because the poor had suddenly decided in unison to be very lazy. Mitt Romney's ""47 percent"" comment was nearly as dismissive as Williamson's vitriol.But this only explains why the rabble are abandoning their well-heeled overlords in the GOP. It does not explain why they have embraced a xenophobic authoritarian instead of, say, the Democratic Party.  The most comforting rationale for Democratic true believers is that these voters are racist and ignorant and hostile to Democratic policies on social issues. That's part of the explanation. But the full truth is a bitter pill for Democrats to swallow. Thomas Frank's new book Listen, Liberal Or, Whatever Happened to the Party of People? documents a half-century of work by the Democratic elite to belittle working people and exile their concerns to the fringes of the party's platform. If the prevailing ideology of the Republican establishment is that of a sneering aristocracy, Democratic elites are all too often the purveyors of a smirking meritocracy that offers working people very little.***Listen to HuffPost's interview with Frank in the latest episode of the So, That Happened podcast embedded below. The discussion starts at the 15:20 mark.Subscribe to HuffPost's politics podcast here.The trouble, Frank writes, began in the early 1970s, with a culture clash between the radical left on college campuses and the conservative ideas about race and gender that pervaded many union halls. The Archie Bunker stereotype of the gruff bigot denouncing communists and women's lib ignored much labor history -- Frank cites the United Auto Workers' support for the Civil Rights Act, ""the union placards carried by marchers at Martin Luther King's 1963 March on Washington"" and the 1968 sanitation workers' strike in Memphis as counterevidence -- but campus skepticism was not completely unfounded. In the Hard Hat Riot of 1970, construction workers joined bankers in lower Manhattan to physically assault anti-war protesters, and police allowed the violence. President Richard Nixon later named the head of the construction workers union his Secretary of Labor. It was not a good look. Organized labor's status was about to plummet within the Democratic Party. Gary Hart started winning Senate campaigns by denouncing Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Jimmy Carter lent his ear to deregulation advocates and appointed a Federal Reserve chairman bent on breaking union power. Frank quotes former Carter adviser Alfred Kahn:""I'd love the Teamsters to be worse off. I'd love the automobile workers to be worse off. You may say that's inhumane; I'm putting it rather baldly, but I want to eliminate a situation in which certain protected workers in industries insulated from competition can increase their wages much more rapidly than the average without regard to their merit or to what a free market would do.""The idea that collective bargaining is incompatible with a free market would have been madness to FDR or Lyndon Johnson or Elizabeth Warren. But there's also a not-so-subtle moral judgment about union workers embedded in Kahn's econo-speak. The rednecks don't deserve high wages because it takes money away from the good people. You know, the ones who went to college. This brand of elitism would come to dominate the worldview of Democratic Party leaders and the agenda of President Bill Clinton.For most Democrats today, the Clinton years remain the good old days. The country prospered, incomes rose, and good-guy Bill survived all the insane political attacks from the Republican bad guys. Frank's chapters on Clinton will make these Democrats feel terrible. Because for anyone who takes economic inequality seriously, the chief villain of the Clinton years wasn't Ken Starr. It was Bill Clinton.Here is a list of Bill Clinton's major legislative achievements: Three separate major bank deregulation bills. Deregulating the telecom industry. Passing the North American Free Trade Agreement. Ending ""welfare as we know it."" Passing a crime bill that turned over-incarceration into mass incarceration. Slashing the capital gains tax. He even cut a deal with Newt Gingrich to privatize Social Security, but the pact fell apart when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke.This was right-wing domestic policy on a scale unimaginable to Ronald Reagan or George H.W. Bush, achievements made possible only by a Democratic president willing to advance the ideological agenda of a Republican Congress (Frank cites a celebratory White House memo saying as much after a bank deregulation bill passed). The upshot of these policies was to shift economic power from Washington to Wall Street, while converting a large swath of the social safety net quite literally into prison.""Toil hopelessly or go to prison,"" Frank writes. ""That is life at the bottom, thanks to Bill Clinton.""Clinton defenders today argue that this was the best anyone could have done amid the full-throttle, facts-be-damned, you-murdered-Vince-Foster opposition he faced. But Frank teases out an elitist ideology underpinning Clintonism, laying bare its roots in earlier Democratic Party trends and its continued influence today. Here's Clinton in December 1992: ""Our new direction must rest on an understanding of the new realities of global competition. The world we face today is the world where what you earn depends on what you can learn. There's a direct relationship between high skills and high wages.""This is the mantra of meritocracy. A degree means money and success. No degree equals poverty, and it's your own fault if you don't get one.It turns out that boosting overall levels of education doesn't actually assuage income inequality. The rate of college-level enrollment has been increasing steadily since the late Clinton years, while economic inequality has been exacerbated. Striving to earn what you can learn has in fact destroyed the finances of many working-class families under Clinton, Bush and Obama. Between 1990 and 2013, enrollment at for-profit colleges and universities soared 565 percent, fueling a massive increase in the nationstudent debt burden. Americans now collectively owe nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars to for-profit schools. It's generally proving to be a national ripoff. Only a third of students at for-profit schools graduate within six years, and those that do often receive limited economic benefits. How has the Obama administration responded? The Department of Education has misled the public about alleged fraud at major student loan contractor Navient. It has refused to punish schools that violate state and federal rules. It has dragged its feet on providing debt relief to students from the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges, even after federal judge ruled that the school scammed more than 100,000 students.""What I fundamentally believe -- and what the president believes,"" former Obama Education Secretary Arne Duncan told The New York Times in 2012, ""is that the only way to end poverty is through education."" Heckuva job, Arne.The student debt debacle has been a replay of Obama's response to the Wall Street meltdown, when he rushed to get money to big banks while leaving struggling homeowners in the dust. His foreclosure-relief initiative was a backdoor effort to help banks, not borrowers. His Treasury Department didn't even bother to spend the foreclosure aid money it was allocated, and his Justice Department shrugged off Wall Street prosecutions despite widespread evidence of fraud.Like Clinton's criminal justice reforms, these policies were not only classist, they were racist. Black and Latino students are overrepresented at for-profit colleges. Subprime mortgages disproportionately targeted black neighborhoods. Wall Streeters are overwhelmingly white. This is why Democrats can't just point their fingers and cry ""but they're racist!"" when considering why white working class voters are turning to Trump. The Democratic Party's commitment to racial justice clearly softens as we descend the class ladder. Democrats, Frank notes, applaud the shrewd technocratic management of the first black governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick. They don't talk much about his tenure on the board of subprime lending giant Ameriquest from 2004 to 2006. Ameriquest was one of several firms sued by the NAACP for targeting black borrowers with predatory mortgages, and toward the end of his tenure, the company agreed to pay $325 million to settle predatory lending charges with 49 states. Patrick now works at Bain Capital.To Frank, issues of racial and class justice get attention from Democrats so long as they do not threaten existing benefits for the multicultural professional class, which sees itself as the enlightened and deserving recipient of those rewards. If the Republican Party had not spent so much of its political energy over the past three decades winking and nodding to white nationalists, the Democratic Party wouldn't be getting such an easy pass from voters of color. At times, Frank underplays the Obama administration's achievements. The creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the passage of the Affordable Care Act really have addressed problems faced by millions of working people. But he is correct to note that Obamacare was an effort to achieve a liberal policy goal while avoiding conflicts with the established order in the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. When the CFPB moves to regulate payday lending, it isn't taking on an industry where many elite Democrats can envision themselves operating. They want to work at JPMorgan Chase, not ACE Cash Express. The Republican Party has been fanning the flames of fascism for years now. It's grimly funny to watch Mitt Romney, who campaigned on self-deportation and sought Trump's endorsement during his birther mania, suddenly insist that the GOP front-runner isn't a proper Republican. But Trump's supporters aren't wrong when they envision liberals looking down their nose at the white trash. We've known since at least World War I that sustained economic misery breeds fascism, and Democratic leaders have consistently brushed aside the material needs of working class people for decades. It shouldn't be a surprise that they're looking elsewhere for solutions. It could have been prevented.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
20,POLITICS,Donald Trump’s Plan To Fix Cities Sounds A Lot Like Hillary Clinton's And Bernie Sanders' -- Except For This One Thing,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-cities-plan_us_56f197a2e4b03a640a6bfc7c,Trump refuses to acknowledge that many of the stubborn problems plaguing cities are rooted in racism.,2016-03-23,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign press conference in Washington on March 21, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f19d431e00008e0171103b.jpeg?cache=KmBeV6VOXL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For Donald Trump, fixing the problems that plague cities is simple: build businesses. The Republican presidential front-runner sat down with The Washington Post’s editorial board on Monday to discuss his bid for the White House. As they walked through his jobs-heavy campaign rhetoric, Trump described how he would create better living conditions in America’s inner cities, particularly Baltimore.“I’d create economic zones. I’d create incentives for companies to move in. I’d work on spirit, because the spirit is so low, it’s incredible, the unemployment, you look at unemployment for black youth in this country, African-American youth, is 58, 59 percent. It’s unthinkable,” Trump said. “Unemployment for African-Americans — not youth, but African-Americans — is very high.”If Trump’s emphasis on creating economic opportunities sounds familiar, it’s because Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have made similar comments in response to civil unrest following the killings of unarmed black people by police, emphasizing the importance of economic development and employment in communities of color.Though Clinton and Sanders share Trump’s view that high unemployment rates in black communities are an issue, however, they also acknowledge something Trump won’t: systemic racism plays a major role in black unemployment rates — not to mention in police abuses and mass incarceration.Baltimore, the city the Post used in its interview with Trump to illustrate the issues that plague urban centers nationwide, was rocked by protests following the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury in police custody last year. As a result, residents' strained relationships with police, among other problems, starting gaining national attention. The city's unemployment rate is 7.3 percent, almost three percentage points higher than the national rate of 4.9 percent. Around 24 percent of the city’s residents live below the poverty line and at least 46,800 homes are blighted. In Sandtown-Winchester — the neighborhood that was once home to Gray — more than 50 percent of residents ages 16 to 64 are unemployed and many have minor drug convictions.At the PBS Democratic debate in Milwaukee last month, both Clinton and Sanders discussed mass incarceration and police violence against unarmed black people, and acknowledged other ways racism hurts communities of color.“When you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration — which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother — clearly, we are looking at institutional racism,” Sanders said.In addition to the disproportionately high incarceration rate for African-Americans, Clinton said, ""There are other racial discrepancies -- really systemic racism in this state, as in others -- in education, in employment, in the kind of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.""But Trump actually dodged questions about racial disparities in law enforcement, criminal justice and police reform during his interview with the Post. Instead, he reiterated previous statements that police officers are the most mistreated people in the country, vaguely mentioned ""incentives,"" and pointed his finger at China.“I have no opinion on that,” he said when the Post asked about racial inequity in law enforcement. “Because frankly, what I’m saying is, you know, we have to create incentives for people to go back and to reinvigorate the areas and to put people to work.”“And you know we have lost millions and millions of jobs to China and other countries. And they’ve been taken out of this country, and when I say millions, you know it’s tremendous,” he added.The GOP front-runner also told the Post he believed that mass incarceration “can be solved to a large extent with jobs.”Though Clinton and Sanders have also emphasized the importance of creating jobs in poor communities, their proposals are far more focused on addressing systemic issues of racial inequality than Trump's. Investing in impoverished black communities is a highlight of Clinton’s racial justice platform. Her Economic Revitalization Initiative aims to invest $125 billion in job creation, infrastructure rebuilding, ending blight and instituting fair housing in communities of color.Sanders wants to spend $5.5 billion creating 1 million jobs for underprivileged Americans while raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour — a move that will affect nearly 50 percent of black Americans and 60 percent of Latinos. Trump has taken a different approach. Though he implied in a series of tweets in December that he also thought wages were too low (after Sanders accused the mogul of not wanting to raise the minimum wage), his proposals for job creation seem mostly focused on keeping foreigners out. He maintains that tougher immigration laws would make it easier for poor people to earn middle-class wages, and said he would phase out the J-1 visa jobs program for foreign youth, replacing it with a resume bank for kids living in urban centers. In his interview with the Post, he did vaguely mention creating ""economic zones"" and ""incentives"" in poor communities, but hasn't really elaborated on any of these proposals.Charles Lane, who sits on The Washington Post editorial board, pointed out that creating economic zones and incentives is not a new response to cyclical poverty, noting that Baltimore has received immense amounts of federal aid over the years. Asked how his proposal differed from those other attempts, Trump gave another non-answer.Despite mentioning that racial division in America is “as bad as I’ve ever seen it,” he chalked up the problems to “a lack of spirit” and concluded that he would make “a great cheerleader for the country.”“When you look at the Ferguson problems and the Baltimore problems and the Detroit problems, and you know there’s a lack of spirit,"" Trump said. ""I actually think I’d be a great cheerleader — beyond other things, the other things that I’d do — I actually think I’d be a great cheerleader for the country. Because a lot of people feel it’s a hopeless situation. A lot of people in the inner cities, they feel that way. And you have to start by giving them hope and giving them spirit, and that has not taken place, just has not taken place.”"
21,POLITICS,Donald Trump’s Plan To Fix Cities Sounds A Lot Like Hillary Clinton's And Bernie Sanders' -- Except For This One Thing,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-cities-plan_us_56f197a2e4b03a640a6bfc7c,Trump refuses to acknowledge that many of the stubborn problems plaguing cities are rooted in racism.,2016-03-23,Does Donald Trump agree with Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on how to fix problems in urban centers?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f198f31e00009500711029.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For Donald Trump, fixing the problems that plague cities is simple: build businesses. The Republican presidential front-runner sat down with The Washington Post’s editorial board on Monday to discuss his bid for the White House. As they walked through his jobs-heavy campaign rhetoric, Trump described how he would create better living conditions in America’s inner cities, particularly Baltimore.“I’d create economic zones. I’d create incentives for companies to move in. I’d work on spirit, because the spirit is so low, it’s incredible, the unemployment, you look at unemployment for black youth in this country, African-American youth, is 58, 59 percent. It’s unthinkable,” Trump said. “Unemployment for African-Americans — not youth, but African-Americans — is very high.”If Trump’s emphasis on creating economic opportunities sounds familiar, it’s because Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have made similar comments in response to civil unrest following the killings of unarmed black people by police, emphasizing the importance of economic development and employment in communities of color.Though Clinton and Sanders share Trump’s view that high unemployment rates in black communities are an issue, however, they also acknowledge something Trump won’t: systemic racism plays a major role in black unemployment rates — not to mention in police abuses and mass incarceration.Baltimore, the city the Post used in its interview with Trump to illustrate the issues that plague urban centers nationwide, was rocked by protests following the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury in police custody last year. As a result, residents' strained relationships with police, among other problems, starting gaining national attention. The city's unemployment rate is 7.3 percent, almost three percentage points higher than the national rate of 4.9 percent. Around 24 percent of the city’s residents live below the poverty line and at least 46,800 homes are blighted.

24,SPORTS,Jerome Bettis Says Series Of Early Retirements Should Worry NFL,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jerome-bettis-nfl-injuries_us_56f16663e4b084c67221825e,The Hall of Famer also wants the league to take better care of its former players.,2016-03-23,Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerome Bettis retired in 2006.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the second consecutive offseason, the NFL has been rocked by a series of early retirements from high-profile players who seemed to have good years still ahead of them.The message those stars may be sending by walking away from the game should worry the league, former NFL running back Jerome Bettis said this week, especially given the increased discussions around football safety and head injuries.""[The NFL is] going to be concerned, because they're losing some of the better players and faces of the NFL,"" said Bettis, who retired in 2006 after 13 NFL seasons with the Los Angeles Rams and Pittsburgh Steelers.""It's definitely going to affect them long-term, and you worry about what message that sends to the youth that is hopefully going to take the game into the next generation,"" he said. ""So obviously it's concerning for the NFL, and they have to figure out how they find a happy medium between health and a product that American people want to watch.""This offseason alone, Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson, Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch, New England Patriots linebacker Jerod Mayo and Green Bay Packers defensive tackle B.J. Raji all walked away from the game. All were younger than 30, and while none attributed their retirements to injuries specifically, there has been speculation that those concerns played a part in several of the decisions.After years as one of the league's most durable backs, Lynch decided to stop playing when injuries limited him to seven games in 2015. Mayo suffered season-ending injuries in each of his final three years. Johnson didn't give a reason for his retirement, though he has battled through injuries over the last three seasons, and an unnamed teammate suggested that Johnson was ""beat up."" Raji, meanwhile, said that his retirement may only be a ""hiatus"" from the game.Those departures followed an offseason in which San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland retired after only one season, saying he was concerned about the long-term impact of brain injuries, and 25-year-old offensive tackle Anthony Davis, Borland's teammate, retired ""to allow my brain and body to heal and recoup.""But even if injuries aren't the major impetus behind their retirements, pain is an aspect of daily life those players will have to deal with long after they leave the game. And part of finding that ""happy medium"" between health and entertainment, Bettis said this week, involves providing better treatment for retired players who are left dealing with injuries long after their careers -- and NFL-provided health coverage -- end.The NFL has argued in the past that it provides ""generous league-funded benefits"" that cover players' post-career injuries, even those that don't show up until years after players retire. The league gives five years of post-career health coverage, and provides access to other forms of care through different programs. Some players can access different forms of coverage and assistance after those five years, and players can file disability claims with a board jointly administered by the league and the NFL Players Association. But that board has been criticized in the past for rejecting a majority of the claims that come before it, according to the Washington Post.Bettis wants to see improvements in the treatment of former players.""When the players that you built the game on their backs, when those players are in need because medically they don't have that protection through the NFL, then yeah, that's a problem,"" Bettis said. ""The NFL protects you for five years after you retire, but the multitude of injuries come 10, 15, 20 years after you retire. Those are when the ailments start to come, and at that time, you're not covered. That's doing a disservice to former players.""Bettis now feels the daily aches and pains that come with more than a decade spent in the NFL. Though he said he wouldn't have retired earlier even knowing what he knows now, the punishing rusher known as ""The Bus"" might have changed the way he played.""I would have made some adjustments,"" Bettis said. ""Not throwing my head in there in some of those collisions, avoiding some of those collisions.""Now, more than a decade after he retired, the Hall of Fame running back is partnering with Stryker, an New Jersey-based orthopedics company, to raise awareness about injuries that cause chronic pain. Though the potential for hits to the head to cause long-term damage has received major attention, Bettis also wants to focus more on other parts of athletes' bodies that take brutal blows during their football careers -- namely the knees, shoulders and other joints.Head injuries ""are the hot-button issue right now, and should be,"" he said. ""But the joint pain and those type of injuries are synonymous with football, and it just kind of goes by the wayside. No one really talks about the pain, having to have the knee replacement, having to have the hip replacement.""Indeed, roughly a quarter of former NFL players end up needing joint replacements of some sort after their careers are over, according to a 2009 University of Michigan study.Bettis wants to start more conversations about those injuries and how to deal with the chronic pain that comes with them, for both football players and non-athletes, too. And amid the renewed focus on the long-term health of former football players, he wants the NFL to do more. (Similarly, the NBA's players union last year voted to set aside money to provide better health care to former players.)""They're on the right track of trying to monitor and manage the game from a health perspective,"" he said. ""I think there are more strides to be made. As they recognize that, they'll now start to understand that the number one commodity is the player.""""The problem is, when you need that [help], the NFL says, 'We're done with you,'"" Bettis said. ""And that's a big problem, because so many players are dealing with this."""

It also caused ripple effects across the country as planes awaited clearance to depart for snowbound Denver.""We've got blowing snow out there, wet snow on the ground, icy conditions, low visibility, so we're fighting all those things,"" Denver airport spokesman Heath Montgomery said.Montgomery said it marked the first time the airport had been forced to shut down due to heavy weather since 2006, when Denver was blanketed with several feet of snow.The airport said it planned to reopen and resume flight operations at 7 p.m.The closure came one day after a suspicious package was found at the airport's main terminal, prompting a brief evacuation amid heightened security in response to deadly suicide bombings inBrussels.A main roadway to the airport was impassable for hours, stranding passengers in terminals.A power outage around 5:20 a.m. MDT shut down many of the airport's systems for about an hour, Montgomery said, preventing crews from fueling and de-icing aircraft.A total of 700 departing and 646 arriving flights had been canceled by about 6:15 p.m. MDT (1900 GMT), according to flight tracking website FlightAware.com.Blowing and drifting snow prompted the closure of Interstate 70 just east of Denver to the Kansas state line, the Colorado Department of Transportation said.Stretches of Interstate 25, the main north-south highway through the state's urban corridor, were also shut down from Colorado Springs to the Wyoming border due to the weather and multiple accidents.""When tow trucks and fire trucks are getting stuck it's bad,"" the Colorado State Patrol said on Twitter.Separately, 118,000 customers in the Denver metropolitan area were without electricity due to damaged power lines, fallen trees and high winds, said Xcel Energy spokesman Mark Stutz.The Denver area was expected to see as many as 12 inches (30 cm) of snow on Wednesday, with the storm moving across northern Colorado, the National Weather Service said.The weather system was expected to move to the upper Midwest as it heads toward New England, the weather service said. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker declared a state of emergency as a precautionary measure, his office said.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) solidly defeated Hillary Clinton in Idaho’s Democratic caucus on Tuesday.He walked away with 78 percent of the vote, compared to Clinton’s 21 percent. That gives him 17 delegates. Clinton picks up six.There was record-breaking turnout in the deeply red state, with some waiting in line for hours to vote. It was clear who many Democratic voters were there for; a CNN reporter on the scene in Boise late Tuesday was regularly greeted with cheers of “Bernie!” as the camera panned the scene.Sanders had a slight lead heading into the caucus, and unlike Clinton, he spent time in the state. He drew thousands of supporters at an Idaho Falls event on Friday, and held another event Monday at Boise State University. Clinton opted to send in a surrogate, Olympic silver medalist Michelle Kwan, to rally supporters at the school on Thursday. Kwan previously worked as a public envoy under Clinton at the State Department.Despite Sanders’ romp, one thing remains the same in the Democratic race: Clinton is dominating. She swept in last week’s key primaries in Ohio, Illinois, Florida and North Carolina, and by the end of Tuesday ― Utah’s caucus and Arizona’s primary were also that day ― Clinton’s total number of pledged delegates stood at 1,214 to Sanders’ 901. It takes 2,383 delegates to lock in the nomination.It’s nearly impossible for Sanders to win at this point, mathematically speaking. As Vox points out, he would have to prevail in practically every remaining state by huge margins in order to catch up to Clinton’s pledged delegates.The next Democratic primaries are on Saturday, in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington state.This article has been updated to indicate that Bernie Sanders won by a wide margin.CORRECTION: This article originally said Michelle Kwan was an Olympic gold medalist. She is a silver medalist. "
27,POLITICS,It's About To Get Harder For Companies To Hide Union-Busting,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/union-busting-persuader-rule_us_56f1bdcbe4b0c3ef52172770,"Under a new Labor Department rule, companies will have to disclose more of their dealings with union-avoidance consultants.",2016-03-23,"The Department of Labor says that between 71 to 87 percent of employers hire consultants to help manage union avoidance campaigns. ""This rule will pull back the curtain on the consultants who craft the employer's message,"" said Labor Secretary Thomas Perez. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A lot of U.S. companies pay top dollar just to keep labor unions out of their workplaces. It's hard to know exactly how much -- or who -- they pay, because the reporting standards aren't all that strict. But that's about to change.On Wednesday, the Labor Department announced a final version of its contentious ""persuader"" rule. Persuaders are lawyers and consultants hired by companies to discourage workers from unionizing. The art -- sometimes subtle, sometimes not -- is known as ""union avoidance."" Unions, though, have a more derisive term for it: union-busting.Employers are already required to report to the federal government any direct work these consultants do on their behalf -- that is, any talks or presentations the consultants personally deliver to workers. However, consultants can also advise company supervisors on what to say to workers and how to say it, thus bypassing the reporting requirements with behind-the-scenes work that doesn't have to be disclosed. Until now. Under the new rule, employers and their contractors will have to acknowledge any indirect ""persuading"" that was done and the fee structure for it. For example, if a lawyer helps a company craft a video presentation that paints unionizing as a bad idea, or drafts a speech for a manager, then both parties will have to inform the agency that they had a relationship and report how much money changed hands.In a call with reporters ahead of the rule's announcement, Labor Secretary Tom Perez said the idea behind the rule was basic transparency. If an employer's message during a union campaign is being shaped by outsiders, he said, then the employees who will be voting in the union election have a right to know that. ""Informed decisions are the best decisions,"" Perez said. ""This rule will pull back the curtain on the consultants who craft the employer's message.""According to the Labor Department, employers have been capitalizing on a ""huge loophole."" The agency says that between 71 to 87 percent of employers hire consultants to help manage union avoidance campaigns, yet the agency gets ""very few reports"" on that work because consultants consider it exempt from reporting.The new persuader rule has been in the works for about five years -- a fairly long time, even by the standards of federal rule-making, which can often get bogged down in seemingly endless review.Business lobbies have opposed the rule, since employers would rather not make such disclosures. The American Bar Association has also objected to the rule on the grounds of attorney-client privilege, but the Labor Department says companies won't have to report the substance of their discussions with lawyers -- only that lawyers were consulted.In a statement Wednesday, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade lobby for large retailers, said the rule would discourage employers from taking the ""reasonable step"" of hiring outside consultants to deal with union drives.""[The Labor Department] is putting employers in a no-win situation where seeking the guidance they need will almost certainly be used against them by organizers,"" the group said.Not surprisingly, unions and worker groups have pushed hard for the new rule. During the George W. Bush years, the Labor Department expanded financial reporting requirements for unions, and likewise, unions have sought to expand reporting requirements for corporations during the Obama years.Michael Wasser, senior policy analyst at the worker group Jobs with Justice, said it's important for employees to know who's trying to sway them.""There's an irony here. It's a standard talking point for management in any union campaign to say, 'We just want employees to know they're making an informed decision,'"" Wasser said. ""The reality is that under the current rule, they aren't making an informed decision, because the company isn't disclosing this third party who's making these claims and running this campaign that's influencing workers' decisions."""
