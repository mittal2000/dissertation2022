It is the worst breakdown in ties between the two Communist neighbors since a short border war in 1979.The evacuation followed days of clashes between Vietnamese rioters and Chinese workers. Crowds of thousands massed as rioters turned against Chinese workers and Chinese-owned businesses, or those thought to be Chinese, smashing windows, gates and walls and torching vehicles and factories.The trouble broke out in Vietnam's south on Tuesday after nationalist rage boiled over during protests around industrial parks near Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.Two Chinese nationals were killed in the violence and more than 100 others injured, Xinhua said, citing China's foreign ministry.China is to send five ships to Vietnam on Sunday to evacuate more Chinese nationals, Xinhua said, citing the transport ministry In Beijing.Sixteen critically injured Chinese nationals were evacuated from Vietnam early on Sunday aboard a chartered medical flight arranged by the Chinese government, the foreign ministry said in a separate statement.Workers from the China 19th Metallurgical Corporation, a contractor for an iron and steel plant being built by Formosa Plastics Group, Taiwan's biggest investor in Vietnam, were evacuated back to China early on Sunday, Xinhua said.On Saturday, China's Foreign Ministry advised Chinese nationals to hold off from traveling to Vietnam and told its citizens in Vietnam to avoid leaving their premises.Separately, China's Spring and Autumn Airline said it plans to suspend all charter flights from Shanghai to Vietnam from Monday, according to Xinhua.The airline said it would suspend nine flights carrying 350 passengers to Vietnam over the next month.Also on Saturday, China's Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng told Vietnamese Minister of Industry and Trade Vu Huy Hoang that he strongly condemned the violent attacks against Chinese nationals and companies in Vietnam.Gao called on Hanoi to ""improve the country's trade and investment environment"", the commerce ministry said on Saturday.In a meeting during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting held in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao, Gao also made ""solemn representations"" to Vietnam and urged authorities to ""bring the relevant issues under control"" and create a favorable environment for trade and investment.Vietnam's lead police investigator has defended security forces and has said ""illegal acts"" would not be tolerated.

Trey Gowdy(R-SC) grills former Internal Revenue Service Commisioner Douglas Schulman as officials face the House Oversight Committee on May, 22, 2013 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c99b200000f90101cebd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Repeats with no changes to headline or text)By Susan CornwellWASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) - The Republican who will lead an investigation of the 2012 attacks on U.S. diplomatic quarters in Benghazi was known for courtroom theatrics in his time as a prosecutor, portending dramatic hearings on an issue that already has strained partisan civility in Washington.Republicans hope to gain political traction before congressional elections in November by accusing the White House of muddying the facts to protect President Barack Obama after the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans were killed in the attacks by Islamic militants.Democrats have not said whether they will take any seats on the Republican-majority special committee, saying the new probe - following several other congressional investigations on Benghazi - is also aimed at damaging former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's chances if she runs for president in 2016.Representative Trey Gowdy, the 49-year-old from South Carolina chosen by House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner to chair the panel, is a Christian conservative elected to Congress in 2010 on the wave of the Tea Party movement.Gowdy came with a reputation for tenacity, and dug into various probes of the Obama administration. He is outspokenly critical of its handling of the Benghazi matter.In a briefing last year, Washington reporters were given a flavor of what Gowdy's leadership of the hearings might be like. He pointedly asked, ""Can you tell me why Chris Stevens was in Benghazi the night that he was killed?"" and ""Does it bother you whether or not you know why Chris Stevens was in Benghazi?""Gowdy's office declined an interview request.Those who knew Gowdy during his 16 years as a state and federal prosecutor in South Carolina say he also has a gift of the gab and a willingness to tug on jurors' heartstrings.""He certainly was not above putting on a good show,"" said defense attorney Ricky Harris of Spartanburg in South Carolina's northwestern ""Upstate."" Gowdy was a federal prosecutor in the area from 1994 to 2000, when he was elected to become a state prosecutor. He now represents the region in Congress. EMOTIONAL ARGUMENTSHarris, who ran and lost as a Democrat for statehouse in 1990, recalled that Gowdy once strolled into a Spartanburg courtroom wheeling a rolling bookcase at the start of a drug-trafficking trial. A King James version of the Bible was prominently displayed, along with some law books.Harris suspected Gowdy of wanting to impress the jury and was concerned the Bible was intended to suggest the prosecution's case had the backing of a higher authority. Harris asked the judge to order the removal of the Bible.""That set off a firestorm,"" Harris said. He said Gowdy ""was highly offended that I would have any problem at all with him bringing the Bible into the courtroom."" But the judge agreed with Harris, and the Bible had to go.Spartanburg attorney Rick Vieth, who has also run as a Democrat, joked that ""I didn't know what I was getting into"" when Gowdy won a murder conviction against his client, Bob Harry Fowler, in 1997. Fowler was accused of killing a man to stop him testifying in a drug trial.In closing arguments, Gowdy gave a powerful description of victim Ricky Samuel's last moments as he was lured to a pond by the accused, who posed as a preacher to get Samuel's confidence.""Walking down to the water with a preacher ... not to be baptized, but to meet Jesus because you had two bullets pumped in the back of your head,"" Gowdy said, according to a 1997 media account published on GoUpstate.com.Gowdy successfully prosecuted seven death penalty cases in state courts. In 2008 he won an award from the Association of Government Attorneys in Capital Litigation. Gowdy also was nominated for an award by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which called him an ""agent's prosecutor"" who will ""give it 120 percent all the time.""Spartanburg attorney Michael Morin, who opposed Gowdy in a death penalty case and later worked for him in the prosecutor's office, said Gowdy excelled at appealing to a jury's emotions.""He is always well prepared, he is going to know the facts. He is most effective when he taps into emotion,"" Morin said.Vieth expects Gowdy to go after what happened in Benghazi as relentlessly as he pursued cases in South Carolina courtrooms.""He is going to be a great fact-finder, and let the chips fall where they may. If it's favorable to Obama, fine; if not, fine,"" Vieth said. (Editing by Caren Bohan and Grant McCool)"
9,MEDIA,These Interviews Helped Make Barbara Walters A Legend,Katherine Fung,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barbara-walters-biggest-interviews_n_5274495.html,,2014-05-17,"ABC NEWS - 11/20/77 BARBARA WALTERS arranged a joint interview with Egypt's President ANWAR SADAT and Israel's Prime Minister MENACHEM BEGIN for ABC News airing on the ABC Television Network. (Photo by ABC Photo Archives via Getty Images) ANWAR SADAT, MENACHEM BEGIN, BARBARA WALTERS",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5bc45210000d501c86df2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Television interviews are the way they are today in part because of Barbara Walters. During her fifty-year long career in broadcasting, Walters has interviewed heads of state, celebrities, embattled public figures — sometimes making history, not just witnessing it. She worked her way up from a ""Today"" girl and fought to be able to ask questions once co-host Frank McGee asked the first three, and went after her own interviews. She famously went head-to-head with Walter Cronkite, and Bob Schieffer called her the ""toughest competitor"" he ever encountered. Below, take a look back at some of the broadcaster's biggest interviews. Anwar Sadat and Menachem BeginWalters sat down with former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in a historic joint interview — right as the two countries began the peace process — in 1977. Walters traveled to Israel to cover Sadat's visit, which was the first time an Egyptian president was visiting Israel since its founding. She recalled going to Egypt on the orders of ABC News, which had learned that was where Walter Cronkite was, and securing an interview with Sadat. Later, she traveled to Jerusaleum to interview Begin, and he told her that he had asked Sadat if they could do his interview with Walters together. She said that when people ask her which of her guests she admires the most, her answer is Sadat. Monica LewinskyWalters' interview with Monica Lewinsky was watched by 74 million people — a record for a news program. Last year, Walters revealed that she is still in touch with Lewinsky ""from time to time,"" and that she would love for Lewinsky to be her last interview. Fidel Castro Walters' 1977 interview with Fidel Castro made history for being his first interview with an American journalist. She traveled to Cuba and they spent 10 days traveling through Cuba together, him driving a Jeep and her in the passenger seat holding his gun. Walters has firmly denied rumors that they ever had a romantic relationship. OprahOprah teared up during a very personal interview with Walters in 2010. The media mogul discussed her friendship with Gayle King, saying, ""I don't know a better person,"" and said she was crying because she had never told Gayle that. Oprah also addressed rumors that she is a lesbian. ""I'm not a lesbian. I'm not even kind of a lesbian,"" she said. ""And the reason why it irritates me is because it means that somebody must think I'm lying. That's number one. Number two: why would you want to hide it? That is not the way I run my life.""Shah Reza PahlaviWalters interviewed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi at his palace in Iran in 1977, two years before he was overthrown. She asked the shah, who was sitting next to his wife, whether he believed a woman could rule. He said no and that he did not believe women have the same intelligence or ability as men. Walters asked his wife what she thought of his answer. She said, ""I don't think you really believe that,"" adding, ""But what have men done to the world, really?"" ""I could only imagine their conversation in their bedroom that night,"" Walters wrote in her memoir ""Audition."" Jiang ZeminWalter's interview with Jiang, then-secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, in 1990 made headlines. She asked him what became of the tank man in Tiananmen Square, and his response caught her off-guard. ""It takes a lot to stop Barbara Walters in her tracks,"" the New York Times wrote about the exchange. ""But when Jiang Zemin, China's party leader, declares in an interview to be shown on the ABC News program '20/20' tonight that the massacre of hundreds of Chinese in Beijing last June was 'much ado about nothing,' even she is taken aback.""Vladimir PutinWalters was also the first American journalist to interview Russian president Vladimir Putin. She asked him if he has ever ordered anyone killed, to which he responded, ""Nyet."" "

We all do the same thing every day, especially black women.",2014-05-17,"NEW YORK, NY - MAY 12: Jay-Z and Beyonce attend the Miami Heat vs Brooklyn Nets game at Barclays Center on May 12, 2014 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. (Photo by James Devaney/GC Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badfa5a200000e500ff2bc0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Co-authored by Mary WilsonBeyoncé is a talented multitasker. How do I know this? Who else can sell over 1 million records without an ounce of promotion while at the same time being a mother and wife? Yeah, me either.Through recent post-Met Gala events recently captured on an elevator security camera and released to the word, we caught a glimpse of the less-than-fabulous part of her life, or maybe just the real part. In the video seen around the world, we witness her younger sister, Solange, attacking and yelling at her husband, Jay Z. A security guard is forced to restrain a clearly enraged Solange, while Beyoncé barely attempts to stop the madness. This altercation ended with Beyoncé leaving the event with her sister, Jay Z taking a separate car, and a barrage of unanswered questions.But to some, the strangest part of the whole scene wasn't the brother-in-law/sister-in-law feud but the fact that Beyoncé just stood there. It was the fact that a couple of minutes after the physical fight in the elevator, she walked out like nothing had happened.In the days following the event, Beyoncé was spotted courtside at a Brooklyn Nets game with her husband, apparently happily in love. I am a huge fan of Beyoncé, but I found it very odd. In the midst of this controversy, she just sat there and pretended that everything was OK? Now let's be clear: B never said ""I'm fine,"" but in my opinion, her smile did.So what is really going on here? Was this just a random family feud that ended with hugs and kisses, or was that video a peek into a larger issue that is cleverly being covered up for the sake of family and image? I think the latter. In a world where celebrities (and non-celebrities) will sell their souls for a few dollars and Instagram ""likes,"" Beyoncé has always set herself apart by keeping her private life private. With her fame, her music telling girls to ""run the world,"" and her participation in campaign initiatives such as ""Ban Bossy,"" she has aimed to empower women and mothers. With that being said, at what point does keeping her life private and saving face in the midst of turmoil tarnish her message to women? I believe it does, since it tells women everywhere that no matter how chaotic your life may be, you must act like you got this down -- as usual.As women and mothers, we are expected to deal with issues at home, privately, and never let the world know the truth, for fear of being viewed as weak or imperfect. Were you too tired to feed your kid that meal of protein and whole-wheat pasta that you promised yourself you would make, so you bought pizza instead? Did you leave your iPhone on top of the car (again) because your brain isn't working today? That's a totally true story, by the way (unfortunately). Did you go to work and pretend you hadn't just had a fight with your husband? Are you seeing a therapist but lying about where you are from 7 to 8 p.m.?Do you have no problem pretending in public that you don't care about what you weigh, when in reality every time you take a bite, you think about how you need to stop taking bites?Why are we like this?Like it or not, I don't know why women are shocked. We all do the same thing Beyoncé did. And we do it every day. She has her image, her family and her career to maintain. We're really not that different. Granted, I don't get to go on my private yacht all the time, but I digress.We are constantly surrounded by examples of ""perfect"" women feeding us false examples that are impossible to achieve. In reality life happens, and life is full of failures and lessons learned. How are we supposed to look up to a celebrity like Beyoncé who brushes these life lessons under the rug and walks away with a forced smile? It's conflicting that all of us shout ""girl power"" from the rooftops while simultaneously wearing the same fake smiles.You know what I would've loved? If Beyoncé had gone off herself. If we'd been able to hear that audio. If Beyoncé had cursed out Solange or Jay Z or, better yet, the paparazzi waiting outside!I would've said, ""Finally!""In ""Pretty Hurts,"" a song on her newest album, Beyoncé sings, ""We try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see. It's the soul that needs the surgery."" The question is: When do we women drop the façade and admit what's really wrong?Granted, in the real world, that might mean addressing a less-than-perfect marriage or a less-than-perfect career or just admitting, ""No, everything is not fine, actually."" When was the last time you heard that from a friend? Probably never, because as much as people look on in awe as Beyoncé pretends that everything in her life is fine, most people do the same thing every day, programmed to just keep going and keep smiling. Why do we all feel like we have to maintain perfection, especially black women? Is it the constant stream of social-media comparisons to keep up with? Is it the fact that we were taught to always hold it together, even when it's all falling apart? When do we drop the façade? When do we black women stop thinking that allowing ourselves to feel is weakness? When do we stop saying ""I'm fine""?"

Swimming up to 100 miles every day, wild orcas' days are filled with adventures and challenges, interactions and complexities. Orcas share news, work together to solve problems and have a rich cultural history. The scope and scale of what Granny has experienced and passed down to other generations over the past century is mind-boggling.Compare and contrast her life history with that of her cohorts in SeaWorld's tanks. Most never make it to anywhere near their life expectancy. At least 37 orcas have died, from captivity-related causes ranging from severe trauma, intestinal gangrene, acute hemorrhagic pneumonia, pulmonary abscesses, chronic kidney disease, chronic cardiovascular failure, septicemia and influenza. Their experiences are gut-wrenching and show SeaWorld to be the biggest, worst orca prison on Earth.As we celebrate the long life of Granny, let's remember what life is like for those who were kidnapped from their homes and families and those unlucky enough to be born in SeaWorld's tiny tanks. Ripped to PiecesNakai, an 11-year-old male orca at SeaWorld San Diego, sustained an injury on his lower jaw that was so significant that it was described as ""a dinner plate-sized chunk"" of ripped-off tissue. It's believed that Nakai was injured on a sharp metal edge in his tank while reportedly fleeing from an aggressive altercation with two other orcas. The chunk of flesh was big enough that SeaWorld staffers were able to retrieve it from the bottom of the tank.

Another of Gudrun's calves was born with mental and physical disabilities and lived for just a short while. And she also had a stillborn calf who had to be extracted from her body using chains.

Seeing a wild orca is always an unforgettable experience, but getting a chance to see Granny is a gift: This old lady of the sea is believed to be 103 years old!Granny's pod, referred to by scientists as the ""J2,"" is the most widely studied group of wild orcas in the world. Researchers began tracking the J2 family in 1970 and believe the family's matriarch was born around 1911 -- just a few years after the Wright brothers took their first flight.Just imagine the stories Granny must tell to those around her. Swimming up to 100 miles every day, wild orcas' days are filled with adventures and challenges, interactions and complexities. Orcas share news, work together to solve problems and have a rich cultural history. The scope and scale of what Granny has experienced and passed down to other generations over the past century is mind-boggling.Compare and contrast her life history with that of her cohorts in SeaWorld's tanks. Most never make it to anywhere near their life expectancy. At least 37 orcas have died, from captivity-related causes ranging from severe trauma, intestinal gangrene, acute hemorrhagic pneumonia, pulmonary abscesses, chronic kidney disease, chronic cardiovascular failure, septicemia and influenza. Their experiences are gut-wrenching and show SeaWorld to be the biggest, worst orca prison on Earth.As we celebrate the long life of Granny, let's remember what life is like for those who were kidnapped from their homes and families and those unlucky enough to be born in SeaWorld's tiny tanks. Ripped to PiecesNakai, an 11-year-old male orca at SeaWorld San Diego, sustained an injury on his lower jaw that was so significant that it was described as ""a dinner plate-sized chunk"" of ripped-off tissue. It's believed that Nakai was injured on a sharp metal edge in his tank while reportedly fleeing from an aggressive altercation with two other orcas. The chunk of flesh was big enough that SeaWorld staffers were able to retrieve it from the bottom of the tank.

SeaWorld personnel drill out broken or worn-down teeth to prevent abscesses and infection. The resulting bore holes require trainers to irrigate the teeth multiple times each day. Credit: David R. Tribble | cc by SA 3.0Dead in the WaterAn orca named Taima died while giving birth to a stillborn calf at SeaWorld Orlando. The baby was the offspring of Tilikum, the angry and frustrated killer whale who battered trainer Dawn Brancheau to death. Taima's mother, Gudrun, had been snatched from the ocean in the 1970s; she gave birth to Taima in 1989. Another of Gudrun's calves was born with mental and physical disabilities and lived for just a short while. And she also had a stillborn calf who had to be extracted from her body using chains. Gudrun died four days afterward and never got to feel the ocean currents or hear the voices of her family members again.

The New York Times has announced that it will launch an online Portuguese-language edition designed for Brazil in 2013, the US media group said in a statement released Sunday.

""A shallow and factually incorrect storyline has emerged"" Sulzberger says in the statement, fueled by ""persistent but incorrect reports that Jill's compensation package was not comparable with her predecessor's. This is not true."" The statement says Abramson actually made more than Bill Keller, who led the Times until she replaced him in 2011, and that it was Abramson's leadership style that led to her ouster. ""During her tenure, I heard repeatedly from her newsroom colleagues, women and men, about a series of issues, including arbitrary decision-making, a failure to consult and bring colleagues with her, inadequate communication and the public mistreatment of colleagues,"" Sulzberger continues. After Abramson was let go on Wednesday, The New Yorker's Ken Auletta reported that Abramson had discovered she made less than Keller, and that her decision to raise the issue had helped lead to her firing. The dismissal itself -- not to mention the revelation about compensation -- stunned many observers, and sparked a spirited debate about gender inequality in the media.The Times first denied that pay was at issue in Abramson's dismissal on Thursday.

He continued:But we ought not find contentment in the fact that these high-profile expressions of outright bigotry seem atypical and were met with such swift condemnation. Because if we focus solely on these incidents -- on outlandish statements that capture national attention and spark outrage on Facebook and Twitter -- we are likely to miss the more hidden, and more troubling, reality behind the headlines."
