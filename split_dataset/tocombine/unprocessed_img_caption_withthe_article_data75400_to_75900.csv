Eger, Van Deerlin Endowed Chair of Communications and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-launches-effor_b_8141530.html,"Governor Brown, Craig Watson, and Assemblyman Richard Bloom (D-Santa Monica) who introduced AB 189, all undoubtedly see the connections between the arts and creativity and, in turn, between creativity and innovation.",2015-10-17,2015-09-15-1442343291-6046668-10BROADJP2master315.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-15-1442343291-6046668-10BROADJP2master315-thumb.jpg,"Last week, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law Assembly Bill 189 , a measure empowering the California Arts Council to designate areas as Cultural Districts in a competitive application process. Craig Watson, Director of the California Arts Council said, ""The signing of AB 189, is great news for communities of all sizes, all across our state ... (we will) play a central role in strengthening local communities through economic growth, increased tourism, and community cohesion. The resources we expect to bring together on a statewide level will strengthen existing districts and foster the development of new cultural hubs.""Governor Brown, Craig Watson, and of course, Assemblyman Richard Bloom (D-Santa Monica) who introduced AB 189, all undoubtedly see the connections between the arts and creativity and, in turn, between creativity and innovation and want California to continue to lead the nation in the development of theatrical films, television, cable and Internet programs, video games, high tech hardware and software goods and services which are the heart and soul of the new economy.AB 189 charges the Council to formulate a plan to foster Art Districts throughout the state, thereby enhancing creativity, and in the process, reinventing the landscape of cities throughout the state. The Council, always looking at ways to enhance creativity in the schools and almost everywhere art is displayed, has now joined the movement to change communities too. They will, according to the legislation, ""provide technical and promotional support to the districts, as well as collaborate with public agencies and private entities to maximize the benefits to the local and state economy.""To date, 15 states have taken on a formalized State role in the creation of art and cultural districts. Together, they are leading the effort to transform America for the rapidly evolving creative economy.According to the National Assembly of State Art Agencies, such ""districts are special areas designated or certified by state governments, that utilize cultural resources to encourage economic development and foster synergies between the arts and other businesses. State cultural districts have evolved into focal points that feature many types of businesses, foster a high quality of life for residents, attract tourism and engender civic pride.""Arts districts, usually found on the periphery of a city center, are intended to create a critical mass of art galleries, dance clubs, theaters, art cinemas, music venues, and public squares for performances. Often, such places also attract cafes, restaurants and retail shops. More and more however, cities are thinking about such districts as a way to insure the city attracts, nurtures and retains the creative workforce it needs to succeed in the new economy, an economy vitally dependent on creativity and innovation. As important as reinventing our systems of education, communities where people young and old spend more than half their day living and working, aspiring art and culture districts are essential to establishing vibrant and productive communities. Indeed, these places are the incubators of creativity. Art and Culture Districts, says Theresa Cameron, formerly Local Arts Agency Services Program Manager of Americans for the Arts (AFTA), ""have the potential -- with their critical mass of art galleries, cinemas, music venues, public squares for performances, restaurants, cafes and retail shops -- of attracting, and nurturing the creative workforce our cities need to succeed in the new economy."" Recently AFTA has created a website devoted to the ""who, what and why"" these districts are so important.As the geographical landscape of a city morphs into a larger metropolitan region--partly because of population growth, mostly out of economic necessity -- what we call downtown becomes even more critical to the wealth and well-being of the people living in those communities. Few efforts to insure America's success and survival in the new economy could be more important.Arkansas, Colorado, Kentucky and Massachusetts are the most recent state agencies to establish such an initiative. Eight other states recognized such districts as tax free enterprises and have adopted similar efforts. The appointees to Art Councils, usually loyal friends of the elected Governor, don't often take on issues of local economic development. But this seems to be changing, as many appointees are visionary leaders, action oriented, and making their voices heard.States use a variety of tax incentives to encourage business development within local cultural districts. Examples of state incentives include sales, income, or property tax credits or exemptions for goods produced or sold within the district; or preservation tax credits for historic property renovations and rehabilitation. Maybe a state will offer an amusement or admission tax waiver for events within the district. All the plans vary and the funding is uniquely packaged to insure sustainability.The ""State Cultural District"" designation from the Art Council seems to be enough for cities to apply, but you have to wonder what cities could do and whether smaller cities might apply if a little financial help were forthcoming. You have to wonder too, what might be possible if more organizations, chambers of commerce, economic development agencies and high tech companies in a region joined forces to help in the reinvention effort."

He was in his late 40s, and while he rarely worked out beyond an occasional swim (he was managing a frantic work life, kids - the whole deal), he always stayed trim and fit and had tons of energy. He was happy and unfettered (for the most part) by the challenges of a busy life. He ate reasonably well, but not in an inspired way. He asked me how I kept my lean body (I was 49 at the time). I told him. He nodded his multi-million dollar head and swept his fingers through his $400 haircut and said, ""Well, that's just wonderful. I mean, all you did. It's inspiring. I think my body is a temple as well, but I like to raid it now then. Don't trust people who don't. Something suspicious about all that.""To give you a sense of where I've come from, here are two pictures of me. Me in 2010:  You gonna eat that?Me today:Is there a McDonalds around here?No irony my favorite ice cream in 2009 was Ben & Jerry's ""Chunky Monkey"". I lost a total of 55 pounds and a lot of Oedipal issues, as well as a need to hide fries on the way home from my job. My favorite excuse at the time was that I'm of Irish and English descent, thus eating carbs and looking fairly sweet and doughy is in my DNA. What's that thing about Law of Attraction? We attract what we most focus upon? I was reading this article recently on Melissa McCarthy. I'd give anything to see her do Chekov in that kitty sweater she wore in the movie ""Spy"". There wouldn't be a dry pair of Depends in the house. To be fair, I have very absurdist taste in movies. I think ""Airplane"" should have swept the Oscars. Anyway, Ms. McCarthy lost a bunch of weight recently. When the interviewer asked her how she did it, I expected to read, ""Oh, you know - macrobiotic"" or ""Paleo or death!"" or ""So much cardio, I vomited a lung."" Instead, she said was something to the effect of ""You know...I just stopped thinking about food. Isn't that crazy? I didn't focus on it like I used to and the pounds faded. I distracted myself. Personally, I don't get it.""After reading her insightful comments, I turned on the TV and there was one of my favorite spiritual teachers talk about America's troubling relationship with obesity. I had been obsessing about the 10 pounds I still have on my stomach. I have this habit of grabbing that last vestige and pulling on it like Silly Putty. On TV, this famous spiritual teacher said, ""It's not what we eat in life, it's how we FEEL about eating it. If we don't feel good eating it, then how on earth can we expect our bodies to like it?"" I'm talking a lot about food because I could go on and on about all the exercise I've undergone. I used to teach aerobics during Jane Fonda's heyday. I wore leg warmers and all. They were very slimming to my fat, Irish legs. They need to make a comeback. Then I stopped doing aerobics, dealt with a lot of emotional issues and got chubby. Fast-forward 20 years. I hit my 40's and I'm back at the gym on a regular basis, but not losing much flab. Fast-forward to age 46. I take up yoga, and I'm amazed at how much I hate the instructor, but how fantastic I feel after. Fast-forward again to my becoming a certified spinning instructor at age 46. Even after that grueling certification process, I only started to lose weight after I stopped doing what Guru McCarthy said, and that was to subscribe to what others said I needed to eat to lose weight, and instead, ate what felt good to me...and then pounds dropped faster than the ratings for the last season of ""Lost"".People who I haven't seen in 10 years say I look younger at 51 then I looked at 40. I always feel a little bad when they say that, and think to myself, ""Did I look that bad back then?"" The answer is, I didn't look bad, so much as unhappy. Or, I should say, not willing to embrace the secret optimist I was. Once I accepted I'm a big sap, who can also be a badass, and I became conscious of how I felt about what I ate, then it became a easier to avoid shoving a Big Mac down my throat in less than 30 seconds behind a McDonalds dumpster.There is a lot more I do. I use an affordable, organic face-moisturizing regimen (it's possible to feel masculine whilst rubbing your face with something that smells of blueberries and petroleum). I'm picky about hair products. I take too many vitamins. I buy clothes on how they feel, not how comfortable they are to take a nap in. Taking care of ourselves as we get older is truly the greatest gift we can give ourselves. If we gain all of this insight and awareness and clarity after 50, don't we want to milk the heck out of it as we age? If I told you everything I do it would take a part 2, 3 and maybe 4, and I don't want to tax the nerves of my deeply stellar Editor-in-Chief, so... I'll close the book gracefully and say this: keep thinking of your body as a temple, but make Indiana Jones proud and raid it now and then. But be careful and make sure your ark isn't made of trans-fat. I've heard that's a killer, but it can sure taste good once in awhile.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

It was the first time that units of ""Kitchener's New Army,"" were deployed in battle. These troops were part of the all-volunteer army that had been organized, on Kitchener's recommendation, to replace the troops lost by the virtual destruction of the British Expeditionary Force in France in 1914. At the time, Kitchener was the Secretary of State for war. Loos also marked the first time that the British Army would use poison gas on the battlefield.In September 1915, in what the Allies would later call the Third Battle of Artois, and the Germans the Herbstschlacht or ""Autumn Battle,"" British and French forces launched a broad offensive that simultaneously attacked German positions in Champagne, the Ardennes, and Artois. The main objective of the campaign was to capture the railways at Douai and Attigny and force the Germans to withdraw from the Noyon salient. As the French mounted an attack in Champagne, the British, on their flank, were also in action at the Battle of Loos. The assault, commanded by Field Marshal Douglas Haig, despite his misgivings and those of the British Commander in Chief, Sir John French, about the timing of the venture, was preceded by four days of artillery bombardment during which a quarter of a million shells were fired. Despite the extensive bombardment, Haig had been hampered by a shortage of artillery shells so the resulting bombardment fell far short of what he had originally planned. Six divisions were committed to the attack on September 25.Haig was convinced, despite the lack of success of mounted troops to date, that the British cavalry could be used to exploit any breakthroughs in the German line. He kept in reserve his Cavalry Corps and the Indian Cavalry Corps. He also had in reserve the XI Corps. The XI Corps consisted of the 21st and 24th Divisions of the New Army and the Guards Division. The 21st and 24th Divisions had just recently arrived in France and the staff of the XI Corps had not previously worked together. As in previous British engagements, Haig deployed Royal Engineer tunneling companies to dig tunnels from the British lines under no man's land to the German lines in order to plant explosive charges, ""mines,"" under the parapets of the German front line trenches. The British attack was timed to begin with the detonation of those charges.  British gas attack at the Battle of Loos, September 25, 1915British forces had a significant numerical advantage over their German enemies; in some places along the front they outnumbered the German defenders by seven to one. They had another advantage; German gas mask design was deemed too primitive to cope with the 140 long-tons, 308,000 pounds, of chlorine gas the British were to use against them. As at Ypres, however, the prevailing winds shifted from time-to-time, ensuring that the gas affected both sides. Although only seven British troops died from gas exposure, there were more than 2,500 casualties.At the southern end of the attack, Haig's forces met with success on the first day, taking the town of Loos (which was eventually completely destroyed) and progressing towards the city of Lens. The insufficient artillery bombardment, however, meant that the barbed wire obstacles and mine fields in front of the German positions had largely remained intact. Advancing in narrow columns against the German lines, British troops were particularly vulnerable to German machine gun fire. Although the British were successful in overwhelming the German lines by sheer weight of numbers, the resulting casualties were horrific. Problems with supplies and the need for reserves brought that day's advance to a halt. Elsewhere, the British gas attack was less effective, even though two divisions managed to gain a foothold on the Hohenzollern Redoubt. British (blue) and German (red) trench lines at the Hohenzollern Redoubt, Battle of Loos October 13-15,1915Due to the shortage of artillery shells, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd wings of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) were deployed to identify targets for the artillery prior to the battle in order to insure that shells were not wasted. Equipped with new wireless transmitters, the pilots were able to direct British artillery fire on German targets. This was the first time that air forces had been used in this way. As the battle progressed, the RFC was used to carry out tactical bombing operations. Armed with 100-pound bombs, aircraft from the 2nd and 3rd wings of the RFC attacked German troop concentrations, both on the front lines and those in reserve formations, as well as trains, rail lines, and marshaling yards. This was the first time that air power was deployed in close ground support of advancing troops. The following day, having brought up reserves, the Germans counterattacked in force. The British, also attempting to attack, and with no preliminary artillery barrage to support them, found themselves again advancing into withering machine gun range without any covering fire or moving artillery barrage to support them. After a few days of on-off engagements, Haig's troops were ordered to retreat on September 28. British Grenadier Guards preparing to advance at the Battle of LoosA further attack which began on on October 13 was called off when heavy losses and poor weather made defeat inevitable. The number of casualties were staggering: 50,000 on the British side, perhaps half that number of Germans. Loos was a complete failure. One additional consequence of the Battle of Loos was that it contributed to the replacement of Sir John French by Sir Douglas Haig as British Commander-in-Chief later in 1915. Haig, a member of Scotland's Haig & Haig whisky distilling dynasty, would command British troops on the Western Front for the balance of the war. His single-minded determination and his seeming obliviousness to his troops' losses would make him a controversial figure in the British conduct of the war and earn him the disparaging epithets of ""Butcher Haig"" and ""The Butcher of the Somme."""

T.O. is all about the modern.Ontario, considered the province of opportunity, comes through as a technology pioneer in this city where gleaming glass reflects the sky. On every corner you'll see people people with a mobile device in hand, gazing intently at the screen.

This suits its location in Quebec province, where the license plates all say, ""Je me souviens"" which means I remember.Sure they have a few tall buildings in the city of saints, as well as a modern transportation and communication system. They're just not as flashy about it. Instead, for Montreal the tributes to the past add a layer of nostalgia missing in The 6ix.What did you just say?Canadians are among the most polite people we've ever encountered, and these cities are no exceptions.In Montreal, ""La ville au cent clochers"" or the city of a hundred steeples, conversations are littered with ""bon jour,"" ""merci"" and ""excusez moi."" That's because 65% of the population considers itself Francophone, or native French speakers. But that shouldn't put you off visiting. Most everyone also speaks fluent English.In fact, though the conversations begin in French they will almost always continue in the language you are most comfortable. (After all, it's the polite thing to do.)Conversely, conversations in Toronto might begin in English but can quickly switch to French, Korean or Hindi. As they say on the license plates, Ontario is ""yours to discover."" That goes for all nations, and many are represented in Queen City. What else would you expect from a modern international community?Still, for any city the true test of of politeness happens on the road. And I can honestly say as a nation, Canada has the most civil drivers. Motorists are so attentive, even my kids noticed how much easier it was to maneuver through traffic while we rode bikes through Montreal. Especially compared to our recent excursion in Albuquerque, N.M.It seems the mindset is that we share the road, instead of ""we own the road."" There's by far less aggressive driver behavior, gesturing or honking on the highways.In many ways this translates to other areas of life including bicycle paths, check-out cues and attraction lines. There was no pushing to get a better view at Montreal's Biodome or jostling at the market in Toronto despite the crowds. Back to the foodSpeaking of markets, while Montreal's are all about the artfully displayed produce, emphasizing locally grown, seasonal fruits and vegetables, Toronto is all about the meats. Don't believe us? Try a peameal ham sandwich from the Carousel Bakery - that's right I said the bakery. It's a generations old Toronto tradition. Peameal ham, also known as Canadian Bacon, is a specialized back cut of meat developed in Toronto during the 1860s by William Davies. It was so popular, some still refer to the city as ""hogtown.""Throughout the market there's an abundance of cured meats and fresh fish as well as sellers of exotic fowl, pork, beef and cheese. Take your time and ask for samples and you will discover what makes each seller unique. We found one seller that had more than 10 types of salami. The dried, cured meats were made in house, some with names like Diablo. Iden had to sample all of them.Sure, Montreal and Toronto have their differences. That's what makes these two bustling cities so exciting to visit - especially if you're looking for a unique urban or culinary experience. But we think their impeccable manners and overall inclusiveness are the best reason to return."

Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, looks on during the CNN Democratic presidential debate Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb9177524000051009908fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since the end of the Vietnam War, every US president has been consumed with and defined by events in the Middle East. During all this time, we spent more money, sent more troops, fought more wars, lost more lives, and expended more political capital in that region than anywhere else in the world. During Gerald Ford's short term in office, he had to deal with the aftermath of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Carter's one term brought success with the Camp David Peace Accords and failure with the Iranian hostage crisis. Reagan was occupied with the Lebanon Civil War, Israel's invasion of Lebanon and the deadly attack on the US Marine Barracks in Beirut, and then the long Iran-Iraq war, and the Iran-Contra scandal. George HW Bush built an international coalition to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation and then turned his attention to convening the Madrid peace conference. Clinton was consumed with years of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. George W Bush responded to the 9/11 terror attacks by launching two failed wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He tried to compensate for years of neglect by attempting to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. It was left to Barack Obama to attempt to clean up the mess that was left to him. He tried to: end the Iraq and Afghan wars; restore US standing in the Middle East; and create a framework for Israel-Palestinian peace. These Herculean tasks were made more difficult by the hyper-partisanship he found in Washington, the intransigence of a hardline government in Israel, and the region-wide chaos that resulted from the Arab Spring.And yet despite this, we continue to suffer from two disturbing maladies: a profound ignorance or, in some instances, a willed ignorance about the Middle East and its peoples, and a failure to engage in reasoned discourse about how we can constructively engage a range of critical problems we face across that region. I have been following presidential debates for decades now, hoping against hope that either the candidates or the media personalities who question them would provoke a serious discussion about key Middle East issues. Most often, I am disappointed since these matters are either ignored or addressed in glib generalities, which describes perfectly how they were handled in first two Republican debates. When foreign policy was discussed at all, it was limited to either exaggerated expressions of love for Israel or contempt for Barack Obama's ""weakness"" and what was mistakenly referred to as ""his"" Iran deal. Carly Fiorina, for example, pledged that ""on day one in the Oval Office, [her first phone call will be] to my good friend Bibi to reassure him that we will stand with the State of Israel"", while Ted Cruz promised ""to cancel the Iran deal and move the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem"". Others denounced President Obama's ""weakness"" and pledged their support for a tougher approach in Syria, with Jeb Bush holding up as an example his brother's ""forceful"" response to the terrorist attacks on 9/11, which he bizarrely claimed had made America safer and more respected in the world. While the two GOP debates were disturbing and empty, this week's Democratic presidential debate was a bit more promising, featuring a significant discussion as to whether the use of force by the US in Iraq, Syria, and Libya was warranted and effective. Four of the Democratic contenders vigorously challenged Hillary Clinton's full-throated support of and vote for George Bush's war in Iraq. Bernie Sanders went so far as to refer to the Iraq war as ""the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country"", with Lincoln Chafee asking whether Clinton's vote for the war called into question her judgment and her fitness to serve as Commander in Chief. Questions were also raised about the role Clinton played in encouraging Obama to use military force in Libya, and her support for US air power to create no-fly ""safe zones"" in Syria. These substantive challenges were grounded in an understanding shared by most Democrats that the war in Iraq had been a devastating failure--based on a lie and resulting in regional instability, an emboldened Iran, a weakening of the US military, and a tarnished US image. As encouraging as these thoughtful challenges were, I was troubled by Clinton's hollow responses and the fact that they went unchallenged by the mainstream media. For example, she dismissed the charge that she had failed to demonstrate good judgment in Iraq, glibly suggesting that when Obama appointed her as Secretary of State, he had, in effect, absolved her of bad judgment. She defended her role in Libya calling it ""smart power at its best"" and claiming that it resulted in ""free elections"" in which ""moderates"" won with the hope of creating a democracy--ignoring the chaos and bloody conflict that soon followed. She also made the evidence-free claim that using military force to create no-fly ""safe zones"" in Syria would ""get the Russians to the table"" and would not, as critics charge, simply be pouring more gasoline on the Syrian fire. The Democratic debate was a good start and I can hope for more, but fear that more may not come for three reasons. It will not come from Republicans, since party has become captive of neo-conservatives and the Evangelical right. These movements have substituted facts with ideology. They see the world through a primitive lens of good and evil and have replaced diplomacy with the simplistic use of force. Added to this, too many Republicans have become xenophobic, demonizing Arabs and Muslims, in addition to Hispanics. Today's GOP is not the party of George HW Bush and James Baker. But Democrats also have a problem. For too long its political leaders have ignored dealing with the uncomfortable complexities of the Middle East because it simply didn't serve any political advantage to know about Arabs and Muslims. All they had to know was that we had an ""unbreakable bond with Israel"". Seeing the Arab World through this lens led too many politicians to either remain ignorant of Middle East realities or, if they did know, to fail to shy away from elevating these issues into the national debate. As a result, Democrats can debate the use of military force, but are either uncomfortable with or averse to questioning Israeli policies or the treatment of Palestinians, or discussing the political dynamics that shape Arab political realities, or identifying the root causes of conflict in Syria or Iraq. Finally there is the role played by the media and their paid commentators who are all too often mere purveyors of conventional wisdom. Because they frequently know less than the candidates they are covering, they are ill equipped to challenge them or to report on their dangerous and/or trite responses to critical foreign policy questions.As a result, while I'm pleased that we are seeing at least Democrats having a substantive discussion on the use of force in Middle East conflicts, it's still not the serious and comprehensive discussion about US policy in the Middle East we so desperately need.Follow @AAIUSA for more."

A. PetersonCo-authored by Augusto ""Gus"" Giacoman The Alarm It was posted on Facebook. One of the authors of this article vividly recalls the gut-kick shock he felt when learning that one of the first soldiers he'd led had committed suicide as a civilian. That soldier had been one of the best men any officer had the privilege to lead -- a soldier who could and did excel far beyond others. He was mature, smart, and dedicated. Now, 9 years later, something had clearly failed him and he was gone. His death was -- for one of us personally and tragically, but for both of us equally -- a chilling, alarming cry for change. Something is wrong with our military service and transition system and we need to fix it.Troubling Data Post 9/11 veterans commit suicide more, are homeless more, and are jobless more than their civilian counterparts. Underscoring these bleak outcomes, top policy makers have noted that the ""evidence appears to be that [serving in the military] is not an advantage."" Supporting this conclusion, data shows that military veterans tend to earn lower wages over time than counterparts who have not served.These statistics are even more striking when you consider that the military is extremely selective. Only a third of the nations' young people are qualified to join, because of stringent standards around education, fitness levels, physical and mental health, and lack of criminality. And while waivers are sparingly granted for some of these factors, the overall applicant pool can be described as elite in comparison with their peers in the general population. Photo courtesy of Gus GiacomanThe young men and women who join the military represent some of the highest quality of human capital our society offers. Further, they are honed by the skills gained in the military, creating what one would assume to be even higher human capital and potential. A service member may learn a range of technical skills in a wide variety of fields. Underlying these technical skills are the leadership, maturity, persistence, dependability, and teamwork for which service members are well known.However, when a service member leaves the military, these statistics reverse dramatically. Why? The causes of veteran suicide, homelessness, college dropout rates, and joblessness are assumed to be complex with many factors deemed to be the underlying drivers of problems with the transition to civilian life, including access to further education, negative stereotyping, loss of a sense of belonging and professional as well as personal mission, and post trauma disorders.Therefore, out of genuine care and concern, a host of programs have been created and implemented in an attempt to address each of these assumed contributing factors. Factors which individually and collectively are creating what is increasingly perceived to be an inherent veteran ""problem"" centered around transition. Each is attempting to correct an assumed deficit, gap, or misperception regarding or implicit within the veteran population. In other words, there seems to be an unvoiced consensus that there are problems within each veteran -- and the veteran population as a group -- that must be solved or mitigated; that veterans are somehow broken and victims. We disagree. We argue that there is nothing inherently ""broken"" in veterans, but there may be something broken in the system.The Machine Is Broken, Not the Man We suggest that a pervasive underlying, systemic cause may exist. And that it may be our military's antiquated personnel system. Recently called a ""polaroid in the time of digital cameras,"" our current system has evolved by default rather than by design. It was built in an era that was pre-information age, more agrarian and manufacturing centered, where drafted men of varying ages either had a skill set before joining or, as veterans, became part of a booming economy where work was far easier to find without extensive education, during a time when a vast population of prior veterans were running that economy and its businesses. Now, veterans face a rapidly changing, information and service oriented, technology driven, global economy which demands more educated, adaptable, and socially skilled workers with shrinkingly few who share or appreciate any of their military experience.Not only do the jobs themselves demand more education and skills, getting a job frequently requires a network of friends and associates. The growing civilian / military divide almost guarantees that a military base will be far from a city, limiting the opportunity for a service member to develop a strong civilian network. Moreover, the demanding pace of training and deployments limits opportunities to network outside military circles. Thus, service members are structurally disadvantaged in the civilian labor market. Photo courtesy of Joel L. A. PetersonThe current military personnel system is limited in its intent and design to equip service members with the skills, credentials, and network necessary to thrive as a civilian. The military spends six months to one or more years training civilian recruits for their military work. A recruit then spends the remainder of his or her time in an active duty unit, with minimal time (sometimes only a few weeks) dedicated to transitioning back to being a civilian. This is not enough; the lack of time and resources to this crucial step inadvertently results in discharging accomplished service members and too many become alienated veterans with limited support, limited civilian networks, limited opportunities, and often lacking immediately applicable skills, experience, or credentials recognized by civilian businesses and society. It is important to emphasize that this is an inadvertent result.  Not one of our dedicated military leaders would ever intentionally set out to create the growing, existing transition issues. Unintended it may be, but it needs to be fixed.Uncoordinated Incentives and Sub-Optimization In business, if an enterprise creates incentives within organizational ""stove-pipes"" rather than across the whole, the overall optimization of the enterprise and its elements suffers. As in many organizations the world over, misaligned incentives, or incentives that do not benefit the whole, are visible across the military structure as well. For example, recruiters are incented to hit target numbers, drill sergeants are incented to get service members through basic training, commanders are incented to keep people in their units, and out-processors are incented to ensure service members are smoothly and efficiently separated from active duty. There is no material part of the military aimed at optimizing across the full life cycle of the service member as a human capital asset who should be optimized not just for military service, but also for success after military service.Photo courtesy of Gus GiacomanThe Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) and many private / public partnerships, like Onward to Opportunity (O2O) and various Department of Defense (DoD) Skillbridge Groups, are focused on helping veterans. These groups are to be applauded and are making important strides. However, the VA's efforts are essentially focused on ""curing"" veteran problems rather than preventing them. Moreover, the few programs which actually start during active duty are highly limited; despite best efforts, less than fully coordinated amongst each; and must be ""sold"" to installation commanders and are often seen as disruptive to that commander's military manpower needs.Shift to Full Life Cycle Success Instead, we urge a new model, which could be embedded in the current structural reform of the military personnel system. The military should view a service member's potential transition as their last and most lasting mission. A possible approach could be to create ""Warrior Transition Units"" which are focused solely on ensuring a service member has a successful transition, not just an efficient one, and these units would be every separating service member's last duty assignment; a required, legitimate part of every service member's military career.The main component of this duty assignment would be a civilian internship of several months. This internship would build upon the military specialty of the service member. For example, a military nurse could do an internship in a partnering civilian hospital.The service member would not only learn the additional or differentiated skills necessary for success in the civilian world but also begin to build a civilian network and the critical social and cultural skills which differ dramatically with the military's. At the end of the internship, the service member could transition out of the service and join the civilian population, maybe even within that specific business or institution where they interned.Alternatively, the service member may decide to stay in the military after the internship is complete. With this new model -- a full life cycle approach to the military's high value human capital -- a service member could find out before he or she leaves the service that he or she may prefer to stay in the military.The opportunity to offer service members genuine marketability as well as insight into whether military or civilian life may better suit them, at no detriment to their military careers, is a critical one which no existing program is able to offer. Those electing to stay in the military would be more committed and would bring their broader, flexible civilian skills into their military jobs, crucial in a changing world where the military's missions have grown more complex, requiring close coordination with civilian communities, and often short of war.Costs Can Be Mitigated This new model would have a cost in time and money, but we suggest that it may be far less expensive than the staggering amounts of ""cure"" resources that are currently mobilized to solve the veteran ""problem."" And the costs could be mitigated. Photo courtesy of Joel L. A. Peterson The time lost to active military mission availability could be counter-balanced through longer enlistments as a requisite for internships and transition preparation being built into a service member's base military career. And monetary costs could be offset by requiring the appropriate provisioning of training and internships as part of defense contractor agreements and as a prerequisite for the opportunity to do business with any part of the DoD or VA. In 2013, the DoD paid $312 billion to defense contractors. Surely requiring they provide internships to services members as well as awarding contracts partially based on numbers of and the levels at which veterans are employed by a contractor is not unreasonable.Veteran Success as a National Resource We firmly believe that our military's leadership is dedicated to its service members, all of whom are volunteers and represent some of the best of our society. We believe our military leaders want to see them succeed in and out of the service. Our nation is grateful to its veterans and shares this desire to see them thrive in the civilian workplace and society, contributing the high quality human potential they possess.We want their success, not just because they represent a tremendous national resource, but mostly because they are our sons and daughters, wives and husbands, fathers and mothers -- and our neighbors and friends. However, the reality is that too many veterans currently are not thriving and are under contributing. And too many are dying. They are not victims, but they bear the burden and the brunt of unintended repercussions from deficits in a system that was not designed within -- or for -- the 21st Century, its economy, its increasingly complex military missions, and the current realities of transition. Prevention vs. Cure and a New Military Mission We suggest that a solution could be in creating a new model -- focused on prevention vs. cure -- one that retains and enhances the military's mission effectiveness, but additionally may prevent or mitigate transition issues by addressing an underlying systemic cause and treating a service member's success after the military as equally critical as any military mission. It would be a most worthy new mission and a seminal contribution our military could offer the society it defends and serves.Like and share this article via Facebook or Twitter.

That's up 8 percentage points since August.The bump is a direct result of better feelings among Democrats and independents. Thirty percent of Democrats now have a favorable opinion of the speaker, a significant rise from 19 percent in August. Among independents, 29 percent rate him favorably, up from 17 percent in August.Republicans' views of Boehner remain largely unchanged. Thirty-six percent rate him favorably, essentially no change from 37 percent in August. Gallup conjectures that perhaps having seen the Republican Party's ultra-conservative wing force him out, Democrats and independents now see Boehner as ""more of an ally."" Despite the rise in his favorable rating, Boehner remains largely unpopular among Americans, with a net negative rating of 14 percent. Other than a brief period right after he took the House's top job in 2011, overall opinion of Boehner has remained in the negatives throughout his tenure as speaker. Still, low favorable ratings are not unusual for speakers of the House. Gallup notes that two of Boehner's recent predecessors, Democrat Nancy Pelosi and Republican Newt Gingrich, experienced low favorable ratings during their tenures. Boehner initially announced he would resign from Congress on Oct. 30. However, when his expected successor, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) abruptly dropped out of the race, Boehner postponed his caucus' vote on a new speaker and said he would stay on the job until a replacement was chosen.  Gallup surveyed 1,015 adults nationally using live interviewers via landline and cell phone from Oct. 7 to 11. "

DeGrom struggled mightily through the first few innings, constantly pitching with runners on base, but was able to limit the damage to the two runs he allowed in the first inning.After losing Game 2 in heartbreaking fashion and Game 4 with the opportunity to close the series, the Mets faced a difficult task against the NL ERA leader, Zack Greinke, in Game 5.Greinke, who went 10-1 at Chavez Ravine in 2015, had a strong game, but a mental mistake as well as a physical one ended up proving costly.In the fourth inning with LA up 2-1, the Mets' Daniel Murphy caught Greinke and the entire infield napping when he was able to advance from first to third on a walk. Murphy would then score on a Travis d'Arnaud sacrifice fly. In the top of the sixth, Greinke allowed a homerun to Murphy, which gave the Mets a 3-2 lead that they would not relinquish.Game 2 pitcher Noah Syndergaard, who warmed up in the bullpen several times before finally getting on the mound, appeared in relief in the seventh inning and held the lead.

Oh, man. Wow. OK.Some men are born great, some become great, and some have greatness thrust upon them. Crist occupies a fourth category where one achieves ... not ""greatness"" per se, but at least something like ""pretty good-ness,"" thanks to the vagaries of redistricting law conspiring to make Florida's 13th District very safe for a Democrat (pending a Florida Supreme Court decision).

It allowed the two leading candidates to make a positive impression on an audience of millions. More critically, however, the debate allowed front-runner Hillary Clinton to boost her standing among a far bigger base of support, making her the clear winner in the eyes of most Democratic voters. A 55 percent majority of registered Democratic voters who watched the debate said Clinton won. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who saw a surge in online interest and fundraising, was a distant second, with only 22 percent saying he was the best of the night. Clinton also saw an uptick in the proportion of Democrats who say they want her to be the party's presidential nominee. Before the debate, 44 percent of registered Democrats said they wanted Clinton to be the nominee. After the debate, the figure had risen to 52 percent."" [HuffPost]Clinton's bigger base the key, but Sanders also benefited - More HuffPollster: ""Democrats tended to think their favored candidate prevailed Tuesday night. Among those who want Clinton to be the nominee, 82 percent thought she was the winner. Only 15 percent of those who prefer someone else said Clinton won, while 61 percent of those people judged Sanders the winner. The poll also shows that both Clinton and Sanders made good impressions on Democratic voters -- 52 percent said their view of Clinton improved, and 42 percent said the same of Sanders. The difference between candidates disappears if Democratic-leaning independents are included with Democratic voters. Among this larger group, 46 percent say their opinion of each candidate improved.""NBC/Survey Monkey poll finds similar result - Allison Kopicki and John Lapinski: ""Hillary Clinton's performance in Tuesday night's debate resonated strongly among members of her party, with more than half—56%—saying [Clinton] won the debate. Just 3% of Democrats who watched or followed coverage of the debate said she did worst, giving her a net performance score of +53. Bernie Sanders scored a +30, showing he still appealed to a significant number of Democrats, according to the latest NBC News online poll conducted nationwide by SurveyMonkey from Tuesday evening immediately following the debate until Thursday morning."" [NBC News]Similar to view of Democratic insiders - Katie Glueck: “Clinton was the clear winner of the first Democratic presidential debate, according to the assessment of both Democrats and Republicans in this week’s POLITICO Caucus, our bipartisan survey of the top activists, operatives and strategists in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Seventy-nine percent of Democratic insiders surveyed said she dominated her four opponents onstage. Fifty-four percent of Republicans said the same.” [Politico]But social media, focus groups and search data told a different story - Andrew Prokup: “The consensus of political commentators is clear: Hillary Clinton won the first Democratic debate….Yet focus groups, search data, and social media information all tell a different story — one in which many viewers loved what Bernie Sanders had to say, or were, at the very least, quite interested in him….Fox News’s focus group wildly praised Sanders [for defending Clinton on her emails]…Sanders won the most new Facebook followers, according to data from Crowdtangle. He added more than 35,000, increasing his following by 2 percent, to 1.69 million. Clinton added about 18,000, increasing her following by 1 percent, to 1.54 million….Sanders also dominated in Google search traffic of the candidates who were onstage.” [Vox]What about those other ‘instant online’ polls? - Josh Voohees: “As of late Wednesday, 75 percent of the roughly 95,000 responses to [Slate’s] “Who won the Democratic presidential debate?” instapoll selected the self-styled democratic socialist as the answer. Hillary, meanwhile, wasn’t even in Bernie’s ballpark. She received only 17 percent of the vote—just 13 points more than Jim Webb…The results weren’t just unique to Slate: Bernie topped countless other online polls, including those at two other national outlets that had also called the fight for Clinton on their home pages that night….So, what gives?…Instant online polls are informal and unscientific. The results rely on a self-selecting group of respondents with no regard to political affiliation, age, country, or even whether the person doing the responding actually watched the debate. Respondents, meanwhile, don’t have even the slightest motivation to be objective…Like tracking new Twitter followers or Google searches, the online surveys provide an interesting snapshot of the mood of a particular slice of the Internet, but they’re mostly for entertainment (for the reader) and traffic (for the outlet). No one should mistake them for the scientific surveys done by professional pollsters.” [Slate]And what about social media metrics? - Matthew Dickinson: “I tend to put less stock in the social media metrics than do a lot of pundits. My guess is that the main explanation for Sanders’ boost in google searches is that a lot of viewers were seeing him for the first time in a sustained setting, and were simply trying to find out more about him by going online. It is also the case that the skew in social media trends reflects the deep generational divide in Clinton’s and Sanders’ supporters – his are younger, more passionate and, most importantly, far more comfortable with using social media as their primary platform of communication than are Clinton’s more seasoned supporters.” [Presidential Power]DEMOCRATIC ACTIVISTS THINK SANDERS IS MORE VIABLE THAN BEFORE - HuffPollster: ""Sen. Bernie Sanders' surging poll numbers and record-breaking crowds have convinced his party's grassroots base to take him more seriously as a viable nominee, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey of Democratic activists finds. But the shift may not be enough to make him the first choice of party activists, among which Hillary Clinton still holds a diminished advantage. And, as the Democratic candidates prepare for their first debate this week, both Clinton and Sanders face added complications from Vice President Joe Biden's possible entry into the race."" [HuffPost]REPUBLICAN ACTIVISTS INCREASINGLY PREFER OUTSIDERS… - HuffPollster: ""The most politically active Republicans -- those who participate in politics and follow it most closely -- now look remarkably like the rest of their party in their affinity for a trio of candidates with nontraditional backgrounds, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll of activist Republicans conducted in late September….The rise of Carson, Fiorina and Trump, which comes against a backdrop of widespread Republican disaffection with their party and its leaders, is ammunition for those who believe the establishment has lost its grip on the nomination process. Arguments about the party's veto powers, however, are predicated on the notion that the establishment is monolithically opposed to those candidates. That degree of opposition is no longer a given…. If political scientists are right to think that 'party elites' will ultimately choose their nominee, however, Rubio is now best positioned to straddle the gap between the expectations of activists and the mores of the party establishment."" [HuffPost] ...and think a staunch conservative can win - John Sides: ""Republicans seem not to believe that there is any electoral penalty for being strongly conservative. But Democrats do believe a strong liberal will be penalized. That’s the conclusion from the newest Huffington Post surveys of Republican and Democratic activists. These surveys asked activists to rate their party’s candidates on a five-point scale ranging from 'very liberal' to 'very conservative' and also to check a box beside any candidate who 'is capable of winning the general election for president' assuming that this candidate did win the nomination….Although Sanders is perceived as more electable than in the last Huffington Post survey of Democratic activists, he is still perceived as less electable than Clinton and Biden. In turn, both Clinton and Biden are perceived as more centrist than Sanders…[GOP] activists see Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, and Carly Fiorina as equally electable, even though they see Carson as more conservative."" [WashPost]LIBERALS LEAD IN CANADA- Canada is having a parliamentary election on Monday, and most of the polls and election forecasts show that the battle for the most seats will be a nail-biter between the Liberal and Conservative parties. The latest poll average from Election Almanac shows the Liberals with just under 35 percent of the vote nationwide and the Conservatives pulling just over 30 percent support.Neither party is expected to reach a majority of the seats, though, as the New Democratic Party (NDP) is averaging about 24 percent support, and the Green Party and Bloc Québécois are around five percent each. There are 12 different seat count forecasts reported by Election Almanac. On average, these show that the Liberals will win 133 seats, the Conservatives will get 121 and the NDP will end up with 79. Bloc Québécois is expected to get four seats, and the Green Party will only get one.Small poll errors could erase Liberal lead - Blogger and election forecaster Bryan Breguet, Too Close To Call:  “If the numbers on election night turn out to be different from the voting intentions indicated by the polls, our projections will obviously be off. There is really no way around it. … [P]olls can be wrong in Alberta without causing major mistakes. Specifically, a one-point overestimation of the Tories (i.e: polls show them at 50 percent but they'd only receive 49 percent on Monday) would cost the party only 0.5 seat in average. On the other hand, the same [small] error in Ontario could put our projections off by up to six seats. Indeed, imagine the Liberals to be underestimated by one point and the Conservatives to be overestimated by the same amount. In such a case, the Liberals would win 2.86 more seats and the Tories 2.65 fewer. Rounding and summing, it's a total difference of six seats, more than half of the current Conservative lead in our overall projections.” [HuffPost Canada] Last-minute deviations from the polls could work in the Liberals’ favor - Éric Grenier, founder of poll tracking and forecasting site ThreeHundredEight.com: “From the perspective of the numbers, the Conservatives were clearly en route to a majority government at this stage of the campaign in 2011. … By election day, the Conservatives picked up another two points while the New Democrats gained six. The Liberals dropped five. By contrast, the Liberals now appear to have the momentum. ... So if we apply the 2011 shift in the polls in the final week to the party with the momentum in this campaign, the Liberals might be heading toward a majority government. Of course, just because something happened in the last election does not mean it will happen again. ...But this does serve as a strong reminder that nothing in this election is yet settled.” [CBC]THIS WEEK'S POLLS-Republican voters think their party is mostly divided, and are fed up with their current elected officials, but they're still overwhelmingly happy with their 2016 contenders.

21,POLITICS,Cecile Richards' Testimony Is A Model For Hillary Clinton,Amanda Terkel and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-benghazi-committee-cecile-richards_us_56213066e4b08d94253eface,Get your popcorn ready. Clinton will be testifying before the Benghazi committee on Oct. 22.,2015-10-16,Hillary Clinton is studying Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards' recent testimony before the House Oversight Committee. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_6_24_1711_1008%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Fresh off a strong debate performance in Las Vegas this week, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is already digging in for her next big test: her testimony before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, where Republicans are expected to grill her about her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Clinton isn't going into this blindly. She has testified about the 2012 attack in Benghazi before, albeit in front of different committees. And she now has a model in someone who recently faced Republicans' ire and came out standing: Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, who went before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Sept. 29.""Cecile was methodical, very straight forward, had a command of the information, was respectful, answered their questions even when they interrupted her, did not let herself get rattled,"" a source close to the campaign said, referring to the repeated interruptions that became Internet fodder. ""She was grounded, she just kept focusing on answering the question. Whenever she would get the same question, she would give the same specifics.""This approach, of course, is easier said than done -- especially after the fatigue from hours and hours of grilling. (Richards testified for five hours.) Clinton's frustration with the GOP questioning came out when she testified in 2012, during an exchange with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.):Richards' performance is also helpful because a couple of lawmakers Clinton will face were also present for the Planned Parenthood president's testimony -- most notably, Benghazi committee chair Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.). Watching how they treated Richards could give a clue about how they will question Clinton.""Trey Gowdy and a few others are on both committees. It gives you an opportunity to see when they're questioning: what's their tone, their demeanor? Each of them had a style,"" the source said.Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Elijah Cummings (D-.Md.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) are also on both committees. But Clinton will also be going in with another advantage: The Benghazi committee's reputation has taken a beating in recent days, largely due to Republican lawmakers' own missteps.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) applauded the purportedly nonpartisan committee for helping damage Clinton's presidential prospects -- and then spent the following week trying to backtrack while Democrats made hay of it. This week, Rep. Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.) said ""a big part"" of the Benghazi investigation was designed to go after Clinton rather than get to the bottom of the attacks. A former Republican staffer on the committee also said his bosses were singularly focused on going after the former secretary of state. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who sits on the Benghazi committee, said in a statement to The Huffington Post that he expects next week's hearing to be all about partisan politics. ""The Committee is supposed to focus on the events of that tragic night in Benghazi, but after eight investigations and multiple appearances before other Committees by the Secretary, I'm not sure there is much additional and productive ground to cover,"" he said. ""In light of the Committee's conduct thus far and the admissions of Rep. McCarthy and the GOP whistle-blower that they merely want to attack the Secretary I am also skeptical the majority will do more than make an initial showing of interest in Benghazi.""Schiff added that he plans to use his questions to try to ""keep the committee focused on a legitimate topic and objective and ensure the Secretary is given an adequate opportunity to answer all the questions.""Schiff, as well as other Democrats, have called on the House to shut down the Benghazi committee, which has cost taxpayers more than $4.5 million in its 17-month existence.The Clinton camp knows the GOP has points it wants to make, particularly that the presidential candidate is untrustworthy, just as it did with Richards.""There were clear points they wanted to push and [Richards] just kept repeating her answer and going back to the facts and going back to the information,"" the source said. ""The burden is now more on them to justify their legitimacy."""

A new program in Georgia aims to address this disconnect by teaching young people of color the skills needed to land campaign jobs as the 2016 election gets underway. The first B.L.U.E. Institute -- which stands for Building Leaders and Uplifting the Electorate -- was held last week in Atlanta. The five-day program trained 40 African-American and Latino participants in how to write a campaign plan and develop a message, fundraise, target voters, deal with the press, and recruit and manage volunteers. It concluded with a job fair featuring major Democratic organizations. Georgia state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams (D) hosted the program in partnership with the Service Employees International Union, Power PAC and Inclusv.“If we want to have sustained and meaningful engagement with people of color, and if we want to create a diversity in how the staffing looks as a diverse rising American electorate gains prominence in the South and Southwest, then we have to start now,” Abrams told The Huffington Post. “Too often, staffers of color are moved into field positions, which are important, but they don’t get the full experience of what it means to be involved in a campaign, and they’re not often groomed to run campaigns.”Alejandra Pablos, 30, arrived in Atlanta thinking that the opportunity would be valuable for networking, but left with the added benefit of making “lifelong connections” with the other young people who attended. Pablos, who currently works for Habitat for Humanity in Tucson, Arizona, previously did get-out-the-vote work with Mi Familia Vota, a Latino civic engagement organization.One of the program’s trainers was Jessica Byrd, a political consultant and veteran of EMILY’s List who is working on a project to encourage more people of color to run for office. Byrd and Pablos had met at the progressive Netroots Nation conference earlier this year, where Pablos participated in the Black Lives Matter protest that interrupted Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. Pablos applied to the program after seeing one of Byrd’s tweets about it.“There’s a huge need to get more people of color into campaigns. We are getting some jobs, but it may not be high-paying jobs,” Pablos said. “And you’re almost always working for a white person. We want to make sure that we see people like ourselves working on campaigns, that our mentors look like us.”Another participant, 28-year-old Danny Glover, echoed the sentiment that people of color often serve as the token members of their minority on a campaign staff and are placed into field positions interfacing with voters, rather than given the opportunity to work in other roles.“For first time, I’m in a room with 40-plus individuals who are all brilliant, all talented, who all look like me, who all share some of the same cultural values, who often have found ourselves the lone representative of all that is African-American or Latino on a campaign,” he said.Abrams has been leading the charge to get national Democrats to see Georgia as a state worthy of their attention and investment. Eighty percent of the people who moved to Georgia between 2000 and 2010 were members of a racial minority, making it a state where more victories for Democrats could be in reach. In 2013, Abrams founded a nonpartisan voter registration group, called The New Georgia Project, to reach tens of thousands of unregistered, mostly minority residents. “We want to make certain that when those campaigns look at Georgia, they understand that we are ready, they understand that we are a state that is quickly becoming a blue state,” she said. “We are an exciting opportunity, up and down the ballot, and we are a fairly inexpensive state to play in.”Turning a state -- not to mention a region -- into more hospitable territory for Democratic campaigns is a long-term project. So Abrams sees the B.L.U.E. Institute as a means to cultivate a pipeline of people of color with progressive values who can be a part of that effort. “If we’ve done this well, this will be the beginning of a long-term institute,” she said. “If we can develop it and build the reputation, it can have a stand-alone capacity and become the go-to place for young people of color who want to be trained and known as the cream of the crop, and the place where campaigns look to find staffers.”The success of the program was immediately apparent to Rebecca DeHart, the executive director of the Georgia Democratic Party. She pointed out that many hires in politics are made on the basis of referrals, making it tough for people to get their foot in the door. And there's a catch-22. “You have to do campaign work to develop the skill set to be hired to do the campaign work,” she said. At the job fair, various organizations -- such as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, EMILY’s List, Planned Parenthood and state parties -- accepted newly workshopped resumes and made offers to participants. DeHart said she was “blown away” and felt inspired to go back to her office and fundraise so she could “snag a bunch of them up” next year."

They claimed that the scanning illegally deprived them of revenue.But Google argued that the effort would actually boost book sales by making it easier for readers to find works, while introducing them to books they might not otherwise have seen.A Google spokesman and a lawyer for the authors both did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Google had said it could face billions of dollars in potential damages if the authors prevailed.Circuit Judge Denny Chin, who oversaw the case at the lower court level, dismissed the litigation in 2013, prompting the authors' appeal.Chin found Google's scanning of tens of millions of books and posting ""snippets"" online constituted ""fair use"" under U.S. copyright law.A unanimous three-judge appeals panel said the case ""tests the boundaries of fair use,"" but found Google's practices were ultimately allowed under the law.""Google’s division of the page into tiny snippets is designed to show the searcher just enough context surrounding the searched term to help her evaluate whether the book falls within the scope of her interest (without revealing so much as to threaten the author’s copyright interests),"" Circuit Judge Pierre Leval wrote for the court.The 2nd Circuit had previously rejected a similar lawsuit from the Authors Guild in June 2014 against a consortium of universities and research libraries that built a searchable online database of millions of scanned works.Google Books began after the company agreed with several major research libraries to digitize current and out-of-print books from their collections.The individual plaintiffs who filed the proposed class action against Google included former New York Yankees pitcher Jim Bouton, the author of the acclaimed memoir, ""Ball Four.""The case is Authors Guild v.

Pundits say Hillary Clinton won the first Democratic presidential debate. Online polls and focus groups say Bernie Sanders did. They're all wrong. Elizabeth Warren won the night.The Massachusetts senator's influence was obvious during almost every discussion of economic policy. All the candidates on stage Tuesday night were eager to tout how tough they'd be on Wall Street.Clinton, in perhaps her weakest moment of the debate, even tried to claim that her financial reform plan is stronger than Sanders', although she resists calls to break up big banks. Martin O'Malley went after Clinton for not supporting a reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act's separation between traditional banking and risky securities trading. A stumbling Lincoln Chafee acknowledged that his 1999 vote to repeal Glass-Steagall was a mistake. Listen to HuffPost's debate analysis in this week's ""So, That Happened"" podcast, embedded above. The fun starts at the top of the episode and returns at the 32:40 mark.Clinton, O'Malley and Sanders all said they opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- a major trade pact that tore a very public rift in the Democratic Party this summer, with Warren its most vocal opponent. The importance of curbing income inequality was a constant theme for all of the candidates, and Sanders opened the night by calling the nation's campaign finance system ""corrupt.""All of these are signature Elizabeth Warren issues. She isn't running for president, but she seems to be shaping her party's agenda.This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Adriana Usero and Peter James Callahan, with assistance from Christine Conetta.To listen to this podcast later, download our show on iTunes.

26,POLITICS,This Is The Most Eye-Popping Stat In Bernie Sanders' Latest Fundraising Report,Mollie Reilly and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-maxed-out-donors_us_56203715e4b06462a13b8414,Only .039 percent of Sanders' donors have given the maximum amount allowed.,2015-10-16,99.961 percent of Sanders' donors could give to his campaign again.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5620373a1400002b003c864b.jpeg?cache=k19K39nzK9&ops=crop_23_514_2977_1486%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As Bernie Sanders gears up for a Democratic primary more protracted than anyone initially expected, he has a unique advantage over the rest of the field. Almost every single person who has given to his campaign can give again. Since Sanders announced his White House run back in April, he has raised nearly $41.5 million, his campaign said on Thursday. But the most amazing stat is this: only .039 percent of the donors are prohibited from giving again.According to data provided by the campaign, just 270 of Sanders' 680,959 campaign donors gave the maximum $2,700 they're allowed to give during the primary. (The campaign initially said they had 650,000 donors, but they gave a more precise figure to The Huffington Post).And that actually overstates the number by one. The campaign has already returned the $2,700 donation it received from Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli, who infamously hiked the price of a drug often used to help AIDS patients. But because the return came late in this fundraising quarter, it couldn't be reflected in the campaign filing. The amazing number of small donors means that Sanders' fundraising will more than likely maintain its pace. The senator raised more than $27 million in the third quarter. According to the campaign, the average donation was $30.His campaign hit 1 million individual donations in September, becoming the first 2016 campaign to reach that milestone.Meanwhile, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton raised $28 million in the third quarter, and 93 percent of her donations were $100 or less. Her campaign raised approximately $5.2 million from donations of $200 or less, and $16 million from max-out donors. This story has been updated to include more details about Clinton's donations.Also on HuffPost:"

If any of this rings true, allow me to take you on a journey through time, back before butterflies became the adorable emblems of feminine fashionability they are today -- or at least, were in 1997. Let's travel back to the 17th century when butterflies were certainly not trendy. In fact, many presumed the whimsical insects to be demonic.

During her lifetime, she'd become the first to observe living insects instead of preserved specimens, to debunk the theory that bugs arose spontaneously from the mud, and to chronicle the entire metamorphosis process of a butterfly. She also created a trove of drawings, painstakingly accurate and stunning depictions of nature's most minuscule creatures, themselves as complex as a humongous beast or bountiful landscape. Merian was born in 1647 in Frankfurt -- then a free city of the Holy Roman Empire. Her father was a publisher, providing her access to many books about natural history growing up. After he passed away when she was 3 years old, her mother wed a painter of still lifes. At 13 years old, she made her first painting -- a rendering of an insect she'd captured amongst plants. Merian married her stepfather's apprentice and the two had two daughters. Instead of following custom and working alongside her husband, Merian provided drawing lessons to young, unmarried women, providing her access into the verdant gardens of the upper class. Merian and her husband later divorced.In 1679, Merian published her first book at 28 years old, a two-volume exploration of insect metamorphosis. In the foreward, Merian wrote: ""I spent my time investigating insects. At the beginning, I started with silk worms in my home town of Frankfurt. I realized that other caterpillars produced beautiful butterflies or moths, and that silkworms did the same. This led me to collect all the caterpillars I could find in order to see how they changed. I withdrew from human society and engaged exclusively in these investigations.""The book was augmented by Merian's unique scientific illustrations, which collapsed multiple images of butterflies at their various stages of life into a sort of ecological collage, combined with the flora and fauna that comprised their habitats. Until then, few had shown interest in the lowly creatures on the food chain. The commonly held belief at the time was that bugs were born through a ""spontaneous generation of rotting mud.""Merian continued her work despite the fact that, as a woman, the odds were stacked against her. At the time, universities were exclusively male and, strangely, women were forbidden from painting with oils. She instead opted for gouache and watercolor. In the three years following her first book, she produced four more. In 1691, Merian moved with her daughters to Amsterdam, studying the preserved insect collections of a wealthy doctor. Yet the lifeless subject matter left something to be desired. ""In these collections I had found innumerable other insects,"" she wrote in Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium, ""but finally if here their origin and their reproduction is unknown, it begs the question as to how they transform, starting from caterpillars and chrysalises and so on. All this has, at the same time, led me to undertake a long dreamed of journey to Suriname.""Suriname is a small country on the northeastern coast of South America, known in part for its tropical rainforests. Merian wanted to forge a scientific expedition to the equatorial habitat, though, at the time, government funding for academic pursuits was typically only provided to men. For eight years, Merian studied and built her case and finally, in 1699, embarked on a cargo ship with her 22-year-old daughter to Suriname on a grant from Amsterdam. A journey as dangerous as this, without a male companion, was virtually unheard of. Although she was supposed to spend five years illustrating new insects, she returned home after two, after contracting malaria abroad. Her 1705 book Insects of Suriname documented the fruits of her journey, describing the insects she discovered, as well as their uses and habits. The book also contained 60 engravings illustrating the different stages of insect development in what was one of the first illustrated accounts of Suriname's natural history.Despite her immense contributions to the field, she's rarely cited for her work in mainstream scholarship. Because of her lack of education and, yes, the fact that she was a woman, Merian fell into relative obscurity. When she died in 1717, she was described by the city of Amsterdam’s register of deaths as a woman ""without means.""Recently, Merian has started to receive some of the recognition she so gravely deserves. (What I mean by that, mostly, is that in 2013 she got her own Google doodle.) But her name remains unknown in many art and science circles.Still, without Merian's skill and courage, we might never have known that bugs aren't demonic creatures that shoot out of the ground. Or that butterflies begin as caterpillars and become chrysalis and then the real-deal, winged butterfly.And then, of course, there's the frightening possibility that that adorable butterfly costume of yours never would have existed. Merian's work was recently on view at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in the group exhibition Super Natural.

Depends who you ask. The global fast food chain rolled out its all-day breakfast option -- something that customers have been requesting for years -- across the U.S. earlier this month. While customers seem happy, some franchise owners are reporting difficulties with the costs and logistics associated with the extra menu items.According to Business Insider: The new menu is slowing down service, reducing average ticket costs, and causing chaos in the kitchens, franchisees told Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski in a new survey. It is unclear whether lower-priced items also means items that don't generate substantial profit.Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that many McDonald's franchisees were struggling, as the company required more investments in equipment even as revenues have been falling for McDonald's restaurants across the country. The estimated investment required to serve all-day breakfast could be anywhere from just $5,000 for some new equipment to $650,000 for a full remodel, depending on the restaurant.More menu options also means higher labor costs. ""Owners also said the launch has forced them to hire more people, which has increased costs,"" wrote The New York Post, quoting the same Nomura survey. The survey included 29 franchise owners, who together own 226 McDonald's restaurants. McDonald's said in an emailed statement that it is ""hearing from customers and the overwhelming majority of our 3,100 franchisees that All Day Breakfast is a hit!"" "

Though the clip is only about 40 seconds long, it provides plenty of fodder for discussions about culture, identity and faith.The story begins with a scene that Patel remembers vividly from childhood. Every morning, his dad performed puja (or worship) at a home altar. He would bathe a collection of murtis (statues that Hindus believe contain a divine essence of a deity) and expect his son to pray with him. ""As a kid, I accepted these practices and references, but didn't understand them, and was often frustrated by them. All I really wanted to do was watch cartoons,"" Patel wrote in a 2010 blog for The Huffington Post.The fictional Sanjay is at first annoyed by his dad's devotional prayers. But soon, his imagination takes off and he encounters a fantastic trio of Hindu gods -- the blue god Vishnu, the warrior goddess Durga and the half-monkey Hanuman. The gods accompany Sanjay on a grand adventure and the little boy begins to get a glimpse of the cosmic beauty and brilliance of his dad's faith.In his real life, it wasn't until he was much older that Patel began to rediscover Hinduism and embrace his Indian heritage. Growing up, the South Asians he saw on TV and in pop culture were often stereotypes and caricatures.""If I could, I would go back to the 1980s and give my younger self this short,"" Patel told The Los Angeles Times in April. ""I want to normalize and bring a young brown boy's story to the pop culture zeitgeist. To have a broad audience like Pixar's see this... it is a big deal. I'm so excited about that.""Sanjay's Super Team will be shown in theaters right before screenings of Pixar’s The Good Dinosaur, which premieres on November 25.

The Times roundup featured 11 white guys, and no women or people of color.Times Public Editor Margaret Sullivan addressed the lack of diversity in a post on Thursday, obtaining comment from the paper’s chief politics editor, Carolyn Ryan:Yes it’s not acceptable and I will make sure, personally, that it doesn’t happen again. This is a new feature that we undertook, on deadline, after the close of the debate. The writer, Alan Rappeport, who is superb, compiled it on deadline without knowing the ethnicities and backgrounds of everyone he included. He was eager to see that he collected enough quotes so that all of the candidates were mentioned, and that he found conservative and liberal and moderate voices. We are going to do it again for subsequent debates and Alan will gather diverse voices. And, as one suggestion, I would like to invite any bloggers, political analysts, and thinkers who do post debate-analysis and are interested in being included in the roundup to email Alan at alan.rappeport@nytimes.com on the next debate day — Oct. 28. Alan does the live chat during the debate and then turns to the roundup when it is over. He will be looking for a range of thinkers.It’s difficult to believe Rappeport was unaware of the ethnicities of the people he included in the roundup; they’re all prominent political commentators -- Ron Fournier of National Journal, Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker, Erick Erickson of RedState, etc.Rappeport obviously went with the marquee voices at a handful of major publications without paying any attention to assembling a diverse array of opinions, and -- much like the 2016 election's major donors, on which the Times did a recent exposé -- they all turned out to be white dudes. This, of course, reflects the lack of diversity in media, where surprisingly few publications have elevated women or people of color to the pundit perch. But Ryan's request that minorities write in to say they exist is a bit ridiculous, and speaks to how narrow the professional network of the Times' politics staff must be -- and to the publication's own lack of diversity. That's not to say it's atypical: When someone calls foul on the media's lack of inclusivity, the response is often to complain that minorities are hard to find.But they're not. Twitter, where Rappeport went to pan for reactions, is full of smart female journalists and commentators of color. Slate's Jamelle Bouie, NPR's Gene Demby, HuffPost's own Amanda Terkel and Fusion's Alicia Menendez or Jorge Ramos are but a few examples. It'd be far easier for Rappeport to spend a few minutes looking for more diverse opinions on Twitter than having the country's politically minded minorities reach out to the Times. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this piece misidentified the outlet that Rebecca Traister works for. She is now at New York magazine rather than The New Republic."
