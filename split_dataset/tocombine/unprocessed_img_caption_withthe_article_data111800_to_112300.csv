Don't worry, though: Ten minutes in, and we already had a headline. Here are the snubs and surprises of the 2014 Emmy Awards.• Ty Burrell for Outstanding Supporting Actor: Tony Hale and Andre Braugher were favored to win here, and ""Modern Family"" was favored to be totally shut out following a large bout of Pritchett exhaustion. Instead, Burrell nabbed the night's first award and put us all back to sleep.• ""Sherlock: His Last Vow"" for Outstanding Writing for a TV Movie/Miniseries: Considering Larry Kramer wrote ""The Normal Heart"" and ""Fargo"" is one of the year's standout gems, ""Sherlock"" was seen as a third-tier wannabe.• Jodie Foster didn't win: This one is more of a disappointment than a surprise, but many labeled Foster the frontrunner for directing the standout ""Orange is the New Black"" episode, ""Lesbian Request Denied."" Instead, Gail Mancuso won for what was arguably the best ""Modern Family"" episode of the season, and you know it's a bummer when we're down on a series' best moment winning an award. • ""The Normal Heart"" only won one award: Despite mixed reviews, the HBO movie had prestige written all over it (Larry Kramer, Ryan Murphy, an all-star cast, important themes). Mark Ruffalo, Julia Roberts, Matt Bomer, Jim Parsons, Alfred Molina and Joe Mantello -- not to mention Kramer's script and Murphy's direction -- lost to ""Fargo,"" ""American Horror Story: Coven"" and ""Sherlock: His Last Vow"" for everything except Outstanding Television Movie.• Kathy Bates topped Julia Roberts and Allison Tolman: This one really came out of nowhere. • Matthew McConaughey lost: It's hard to call this category a snub because Bryan Cranston is still deserving for ""Breaking Bad,"" but this was McConaughey's only chance to win for ""True Detective.""• ""Modern Family"" beat ""Orange is the New Black,"" ""Veep,"" ""Louie"" and ""Silicon Valley"": With five wins each, ""Frasier"" and ""Modern Family"" are now the most-awarded comedies in Emmy history. Someone pinch us, we must be endlessly bored."
1,IMPACT,Rage in Ferguson Offers Important Lesson,"Lecia Brooks, ContributorDirector, Civil Rights Memorial Center, Southern Poverty Law C...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rage-in-ferguson-offers-important-lesson_b_5701586.html,It's time to listen to the hopes and fears of all Americans.

And we must do it before the rage our nation has witnessed permanently supplants hope.,2014-08-26,"ST. LOUIS, MO - AUGUST 25: Lesley McSpadden, mother of Michael Brown, heads into Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church for the funeral of her son on Monday, August 25, 2014, in St. Louis, MO. Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African American male, was fatally gunned down by a White police officer, Darren Wilson, on August 9 in Ferguson, MO. (Photo by Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1ca6824000051005561af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The seemingly nonstop coverage of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, by cable news networks provided little beyond a disturbing loop of images -- officers with guns trained on civilians, smoking tear gas canisters flying through the night air and the surreal sight of armored vehicles rolling through an American city.Almost two weeks after Michael Brown died in the street after being shot by a police officer a half-dozen times, this nation hasn't taken the steps necessary to understand the root causes of the rage in Ferguson.And, as a nation, we must understand it. The rage in Ferguson goes beyond the death of Michael Brown. It's about what African Americans in Ferguson and elsewhere experience every day.For too many, it is a cycle of poverty, discrimination and hopelessness. It is life in neighborhoods where encounters with the local police leave residents feeling that the police aren't there to protect and serve -- but are rather an occupying force.There are plenty of reasons behind this pervasive sense of hopelessness.For many young people of color, it starts in school. That's where harsh zero-tolerance policies disproportionately push black children out of class and into the juvenile justice system. Many of these children will not finish high school but rather ""graduate"" into the adult criminal justice system -- one that has undergone a massive, and unprecedented, expansion over the past four decades. This growth, while initially a reaction to rising crime rates, has been largely the product of a long and destructive campaign by certain political interests to stoke white anxiety and fear in the wake of the civil rights movement -- fear of young black men like Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin. Our country now has seven times the number of prisoners it had in 1972 -- leading the world, by far, in both the total prison population and the per-capita incarceration rate.The grim fact is that African-American men born since the late 1960s are more likely to have served time in prison than to have completed college with a four-year degree. Those under 35 who failed to finish high school are now more likely to be behind bars than in jobs.Part of this is explained by the fact that police in many cities routinely target young black men for drug arrests. Although black and white people use drugs at roughly the same rates, arrest rates are three to five times higher for African Americans. The children of incarcerated parents suffer the consequences as well. From 1991 to 2007, the number of children of any race with an incarcerated father rose 77 percent, the National Academy of Sciences has reported. The number of children with a mother incarcerated climbed 131 percent during the same time.Once released from prison, people face joblessness, family breakdown, poverty and other seemingly insurmountable hurdles. Even if a black household hasn't struggled with a member being incarcerated, there are significant obstacles. As Thomas B. Edsall recently noted in the New York Times, the median income for black households in 2012 was just 58.4 percent of white household income -- virtually the same level as in 1967. In other words, the economic gains since the civil rights movement have been erased for many black households.But the protestors in Ferguson don't need to read statistics to recognize the problems facing their community. They see them every day. It took the sight of Michael Brown's lifeless body in the street for the rest of the nation to notice.Now, we must listen and understand. We must listen to and understand the protestors. We must listen to and understand people trapped in cycles of poverty and hopelessness -- people subjected to police harassment that's beyond the comprehension of those living in more privileged communities. The statistics speak loud and clear, but the voices behind these numbers have been ignored for far too long. It's time to listen to the hopes and fears of all Americans. It's time to recognize the injustices that we must eliminate to ensure all Americans can pursue their dreams. And we must do it before the rage our nation has witnessed permanently supplants hope."

But there's no doubt that Mara's red carpet look on Monday was anything but ordinary. Wearing a white, flowing gown by J. Mendel with an intricately-laced bodice with black embroidery, the star accessorized with chunky white stilettos, black nails and fierce eye makeup. Mara is known for taking fashion risks, most recently with a pale pink and yellow Dior dress at the 2014 Creative Emmy Awards. Although Mara's character was (spoiler alert!) killed off of the Netflix series this past season, we're looking forward to many more projects and interesting outfit choices from the actress.

3,BLACK VOICES,Can Taylor Swift Teach Us Anything About Ferguson?,"Andy Hoglund, ContributorPublic relations executive, Rasky Baerlein Strategic Communica...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/can-taylor-swift-teach-us-about-ferguson_b_5697938.html,"Escalating racial tensions, and the puzzled response from white America, reminds us that many in suburbia still have no clue about American's complicated history with race. Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off"" may be bubblegum fun, but it does not deserve a ghetto pass (regardless of her playful ""I'm such a dork!"" tone).",2014-08-26,"LAS VEGAS, NV - MAY 19: Singer Taylor Swift performs onstage during the 2013 Billboard Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 19, 2013 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badfe9a240000310054cf49.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Internet's left nut trembled earlier this week as Taylor Swift unveiled the video for her already-smash single ""Shake It Off."" Immediately, countless Americans digested the video's glorious imagery, inhaling its infectious pop sensibility. To be sure, the world still belongs to Taylor: ""Shake It Off"" has already amassed over 20 million views on YouTube. The 24-year-old singer's song surged to number one on iTunes in a matter of hours after its release, causing Taylor to tweet -- aptly -- WHAT EVEN, HOW EVEN in response.Just as immediate as the song's success, however, a vocal chorus of criticism emerged. Some discount it for being too impersonal; for others it's too far a departure from Taylor's country roots. Perhaps no single criticism received more attention than from Earl Sweatshirt, himself previously a kind of a pop provocateur, given his alliance with the rap group Odd Future. However, in this instance, Earl was dead serious on Twitter:@earlxsweat · Aug 18 haven't watched the taylor swift video and I don't need to watch it to tell you that it's inherently offensive and ultimately harmfulNow, admittedly, I am a fan of the singer's (as I attempted to articulate in this 2012 love letter to ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together""). To me, accusations of the song as too ""perfect"" or cookie cutter miss the point, as the song's lyrics lightheartedly refute critics' perception of Swift as being melodramatic/whiny about her staggering romantic life. It's a clear evolution for the singer, but distinctly Taylor.Nevertheless, Earl's incisive tweets struck a chord. Sure, he's copped to not even watching the video (or so he says). Like Taylor, Earl is a young performer continuing to develop as an artist; although his discography is mixed, he remains one of those singular voices capable of tapping into the zeitgeist in a meaningful way. Last week, he captured a real truth.Ferguson, Missouri, continues to dominate the news, and the think pieces have snowballed into one large, indomitable force of hand-wringing and pandering racial politics. Seemingly, everyone has an opinion, yet no one has any answers. One piece worth reviewing -- especially in lieu of Earl Sweatshirt's tweets -- is Globe columnist Derrick Jackson's piece, ""White America's racial blinders."" In it, he describes white America's ""stunningly Pollyannaish view of inequity,"" and contextualizes Michael Brown's killing within a larger prism of indifference toward both poverty and violence toward black Americans. It is a riveting column that demands we reexamine our own racial perceptions, particularly within our increasingly subjective cultural lens.As Earl hints at, today's world affords us many luxuries, with one of the Internet's many benefits being the idea that cultural walls are coming down -- that we finally can experience things, and understand one another with enhanced clarity. Perhaps, to an extent, that is true. After all, as President Obama continues to underscore in his remarks, the United States has taken great strides in confronting the racial divide over the past few decades. Music videos starring pop starlets coopting black culture imply that artists' comfort level with things like twerking. This ghettofication of popular music banks on the country being categorically and assuredly post-racial. But are we ready to concede that Taylor Swift is a cultural ambassador? Have we really gone from MLK and Muhammad Ali to... Miley Cyrus? Ferguson's burning, and Earl's tweets, suggest no. Ultimately, there is still a huge economic gap in this country which is, often, defined along racial lines. Social media -- or the advent of the digital age -- may hint that we've reached cultural equilibrium... but I think that's misleading. Differences still exist, and Swift's goofy post-racial iconography remains a fantasy. Escalating racial tensions, and the puzzled response from white America, reminds us that many in suburbia still have no clue about American's complicated history with race. Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off"" may be bubblegum fun, but it does not deserve a ghetto pass (regardless of her playful ""I'm such a dork!"" tone). It's totally unearned. She can sing teardrops on her guitar, but she isn't entitled to do whatever she wants. That's what Earl Sweatshirt is tweeting about. He's right."

Her neutral lipstick accessorized her most famous asset -- her gorgeous smile -- but her gorgeous gams (in mile-high stilettos) totally stole the show.

5,WOMEN,Extraordinary Women in Business: What Inspires Them to Keep Succeeding?,"Stacia Pierce, ContributorLife coach, career expert and CEO, Ultimate Lifestyle Enterprises",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/extraordinary-women-in-business_b_5697878.html,Today I am sharing what I believe are success clues gleamed by extraordinary women who have reached the pinnacle of success in their fields. Many of these women have key habits and practices in common that played a big part in their career.,2014-08-26,"Kimora Lee Simmons arrives at Essence magazine's Black Women in Hollywood luncheon in Beverly Hills, Calif., Thursday, Feb. 24, 2011. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fc452200005700dc9d78.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We all love a good success story. We learn about someone who built a business from the ground up, where they came from and how they got to where they are today. While a lot can be learned from that process, the question remains: What inspires successful people to keep succeeding? I have always taught my clients that successful people leave clues. If you study them, you will find a common theme: Success can be found in one's daily habits. If you can change your habits, you can change your life. Today I am sharing what I believe are success clues gleamed by extraordinary women who have reached the pinnacle of success in their fields. Many of these women have key habits and practices in common that played a big part in their career. When these habits are practiced, inspiration flows easily. And with inspiration comes continued success. Success Clue: Visualization Kimora Lee Simmons, President and Creative Director of JustFabVisualization is a true success secret that many either aren't aware of, or don't take as seriously as they should. It is about taking time each and every day to sit quietly and imagine: imagine all of your dreams and goals, imagine yourself reaching them, imagine how it feels to accomplish them, imagine what your dream life looks like, imagine your best possible outcome. Visualization is about seeing it in your head. When you do this, your subconscious mind will go to work on attracting it into your life.This is exactly what happened with Kimora Lee Simmons. In her book Fabulosity, she writes that with the first checking account she opened she wrote herself a check for $1 million. She says that she wrote it as a promise to herself of the success she would have in her future. Although she was earning good money as a model at the time, she wasn't yet at millionaire status. So she wrote the check and kept it in a treasure box. Kimora went on to create fashion label Baby Phat and it become a household name and multi-million dollar lifestyle brand. Kimora is now the President and Creative Director of JustFab, an online fashion subscription service that offers a personalized shopping experience for its members. Kimora has said that she still has that $1 million check and if she wanted to cash it today, she could. Because she visualized the outcome she desired, she was able to achieve that exact thing.Success Clue: Planning Natalie Massanet, founder and Executive Chairman of Net-a-PorterPlanning is a critical component to success as an entrepreneur. Planning and preparation are never lost time. It is important to plan out your week and day while also planning for the month and entire year. Things will always go so much more smoothly when you have planned them out. Slow down, get quiet for a few minutes and think through the process. What is your next move? What step should you take next to move you closer to your goal? What big things do you want to accomplish, and what plans are needed to make them happen?In a Glamour magazine article, Natalie Massanet said, ""Success begins at that magical moment when you declare to yourself, your friends, and the universe that you believe you can do something different."" Natalie started Net-a-Porter, an e-commerce site for designer fashion, long before anyone else had even thought of such an idea. This year, Time magazine named Natalie as one of the 100 Most Influential People. She is now executive chairman of her company after selling it for $350 million.This innovative entrepreneur tells her entire story through her Instagram account, @nataporter_mystorysofar. One of the posts tells of how she had the opportunity to travel to Tokyo, Japan, after graduating from college. She only had a hotel room for three nights and a small amount of spending money from her father. However, she was determined to stay and had already told her friends that she would be living there for a year! Through a strong belief in herself, she was able to make the trip a success and stay for exactly one year, despite not having a job or place to live when she first arrived. However, what she did before leaving for Japan was plan carefully. She researched potential teaching jobs and made contacts in Tokyo before her trip. Because of her planning, it was easy to get work, find housing and begin to make a living very quickly after arriving in the city that she was supposed to be in for three days. Success Clue: Self-study Sara Blakely, founder of SpanxDoing your own research as an entrepreneur is crucial. We live in the ""information age,"" and it is readily available through so many channels. You have to know your industry and your market. To do that you need to carefully study it. It's also important to recognize what you don't know and be willing to learn and grow in any area necessary to succeed, even if that means teaching yourself. For example, as a business owner, the bookstore should be one of your favorite places to spend time.Sara Blakely is a self-made billionaire, that's right, a billionaire, thanks to her now-infamous shapewear line, Spanx. While the prototype was in development, Sara began working on the patent for her game-changing product. At the time, because her product was just getting ready to launch, she wasn't willing to spend up to $5,000 in legal fees that a patent lawyer would cost. In order to apply for the patent for Spanx, Sara actually wrote her own patent after purchasing a textbook from Barnes & Noble. Her resourcefulness and willingness to learn about patent law saved her thousands of dollars while gaining her a patent and trademark at a fraction of the cost. Her company went on to achieve $4 million in sales in its first year alone. She is now the world's youngest self-made female billionaire and Forbes has named her among its top 100 ""Power Women Who Lead the World.""Success Clue: Storyboarding Kelly Wearstler, interior designer, fashion designer and bloggerStoryboarding is widely used in the film and fashion industries as a way to visually map out anything from a movie scene to a new designer collection. In business, storyboarding can also be used as a tool to create a visual roadmap for where you want to go. It is as easy as cutting out words and images from magazines and pasting them on to a board. Keep the board in a place where you will see it every day. Focus on it during your time of visualization. Storyboarding is a practice that can accelerate your goals. Kelly Wearstler has risen to the top of her industry as an interior designer, and is also a successful fashion designer, author and blogger. She has collaborated with global brands such as Bergdorf Goodman and Paperless Post, and appeared as a judge on Bravo TV's series Top Design. Kelly's blog, MyVibeMyLife, houses mood imagery and inspiration garnered from sources around the globe. It is like a stunning digital storyboard showcasing everything that Kelly draws inspiration from. She posts photos of everything that inspires her in the design and creative process. Her blog alone has gained a worldwide following and is a great example of how the process of storyboarding can come to life.Success Clue: Networking  Ivanka Trump, Executive Vice President of Development & Acquisitions for The Trump OrganizationIt is important to always be nice to people, as you truly never know whom you're going to be sitting next to. Networking can be done anywhere. As a business owner you have to step out of your comfort zone and talk to people, every day, everywhere you go. Carry business cards and set a goal amount that you will distribute daily. You just never know what connection could lead to a major breakthrough for you and your business. With an impressive resume that includes model, business executive, author and fashion designer for her Ivanka Trump Collection brand, Ivanka Trump learned early on the value of networking. In her book The Trump Card, Ivanka explains how she learned from her mother the art of sending hand-written notes. Practicing this put her face-to-face in a private one-on-one meeting with the world's wealthiest man. She shares how she sent a note to Carlos Slim, who is known as the richest man in Mexico and was ranked by Forbes as the richest person in the world from 2010 to 2013. Ivanka had read of his success in rescuing The New York Times from financial trouble. She was impressed and sent him a note stating she had been following his brilliant career. A week later, the business mogul contacted Ivanka and invited her to a meeting where she was able to spend two hours discussing business philosophies, real estate trends and the future of media. Ivanka said, ""I believe very strongly in the power of networking."" Success Clue: Authenticity Rebecca Minkoff, fashion designer and Creative Director of Rebecca Minkoff LLCAs an entrepreneur, you are your brand. And as people learn of your brand, they will want to get to know the face and name behind it. They will want to get to know you. Showing your real and true self to your customer goes a long way toward earning their trust, which in turn earns their business and builds a loyal following. Social media is one of the best ways to get your brand out there and let people see your authentic self. BusinessWire has listed Rebecca Minkoff's company among the top 50 fastest-growing women-led companies. The brand's expansion can largely be attributed to the use of social media. Rebecca says she uses sites like Twitter and Facebook to listen to her customers and connect with them. She takes their feedback seriously. According to a report in Women's Wear Daily, Rebecca used Instagram to post a photo of her own shoes each day. This prompted a 100 percent increase in footwear sales in 2012. In an Entrepreneur magazine article, Rebecca said, ""I'm never going to be a designer who will sit in an ivory tower. My die-hards know that they can email me and I'll be the one responding.""Success Clue: Atmosphere Beyonce Knowles-Carter, musical artist and entertainerYour environment plays such a big part in your success. Among other things, it affects your mood, productivity, creativity and thinking. A messy or cluttered environment will drain you. On the contrary, a beautiful, clean environment will energize you. Additionally, a change of scenery every so often is just as important. Expose yourself to new places. Exposure breeds desire, and with it motivation to forge ahead. Beyonce, a world-famous musical superstar, understands the importance of getting in the right atmosphere. In a Self magazine interview, Beyonce said, ""I love going to dinners, seeing plays and visiting museums. I know it's time to jump back into my work when everything I do starts inspiring lyrics and melodies."" She is able to stay inspired by changing her environment and exposing herself to new things. Success Clue: Tuning in to Intuition Oprah Winfrey, media and television hostTuning into intuition is sometimes overlooked because we have a tendency to focus on all the practical things we can do. However, having a spiritual focus is important too. Oprah Winfrey is a great example of this. Take time regularly to focus on your inner voice: What is your intuition telling you?Oprah has perhaps one of the most inspiring success stories of all. From growing up poor and suffering abuse as a child, to turning her life around by focusing on her education, to moving up through the ranks in the media industry, to getting her own talk show. Oprah set big, yet clear, goals about what she wanted to achieve in life from a young age. In 1987, she was quoted saying, ""I always knew I'd be a millionaire by age thirty-two."" Oprah is known for following her intuition. Going with her gut instinct has been a major force behind her success. She practices quiet meditation and listens to her inner voice. She has said in interviews that she takes time daily to get quiet: ""Take five minutes to center yourself in the morning...Set your intention every day...If you don't have five minutes, you don't deserve to have the life of your dreams.""Success Clue: Mentorship  Tracy Reese, fashion designerAs they say, ""no man is an island."" We all succeed through the help of others. It is often those who recognize the need for coaching and mentorship who achieve their goals more quickly and reach higher levels of success. When you are willing to follow the path carved out by those who have gone before you, it makes it that much easier to get there. Tracy Reese is a fashion visionary whose designs are famously worn by First Lady Michelle Obama. She grew up in a middle-class household in Detroit and would sew clothes for her dolls as a child. She had the opportunity to attend New York's Parsons School of Design through a scholarship and finished in an accelerated program. From there she became an apprentice to French designer Martine Sitbon. Through this relationship, Tracy was encouraged to develop her talents and start sketching her own designs. This was very uncommon in the industry, but because Tracy had found a great mentor, she was pushed to move forward toward her dream of designing for her own line.Tracy went on to work for Perry Ellis, and teamed up with designer Gordon Henderson, who also became a mentor to her. By this point in her career, she had tried to start her own line but had to close the business because she couldn't meet production costs. Henderson mentored her about running a successful start-up line. Tracy re-launched a contemporary sportswear line but continued struggling to meet costs. Finally she was connected to an accountant who was a India native with ties to textile manufacturers. She launched her Plenty line and sales grew into the millions. Today she is one of the top African American women designers running her own label. Because she recognized that she couldn't do it alone and followed the wisdom of her mentors, Tracy was able to reach major success.These are some of the success clues that extraordinary women have followed. When you catch the clues and implement it into your own life and daily routine, you will notice your mindset begin to change, and you will start to form success habits that cause you to manifest your desires. Be inspired by the examples of success by stocking up on books and audio programs that guide you towards your goals. My book Success Attraction Notes and Quotes, is a compilation of my own success clues that many have asked of me. It's set up as a 30-day program to help you take daily action as you pursue your own extraordinary achievement! Tell me in the comments below, what successful clues have you picked up and implemented in your business and life?"

8,TRAVEL,7 Secrets of Seattle,"Kerri Allen, ContributorLifestyle Journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/7-secrets-of-seattle_b_5685843.html,"Seattle is renowned as the home of Kurt Cobain, the venti Frappuccino and depression-inducing drizzle (see: Cobain).

Here are a couple of other Seattle secrets you may have never known.",2014-08-26,2014-08-17-Starbucks_Coffee_Roasted_Cover_Above.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-17-Starbucks_Coffee_Roasted_Cover_Above-thumb.JPG,"Seattle is renowned as the home of Kurt Cobain, the venti Frappuccino and depression-inducing drizzle (see: Cobain). But it's also home to the chillest cops in the nation, Eddie Bauer's iconic down jacket and a weird rivalry with Tacoma. Here are a couple of other Seattle secrets you may have never known: 1. The entire thing burned down in 1889  Seattle didn't kick-off as an official American city until 1851. The first white settlers attempted to call their landing site ""New York."" After hearing that was taken, they opted for ""Seattle."" The drastic pivot in nomenclature honored a Duwamish Indian leader named Sealth who had helped them move in.Talk about a housewarming. Just 40 years into city life, a woodworker's shop at Front and Madison caught fire and for 18 hours the flames swept southward across 100 acres of Seattle's business district and waterfront. Donations in excess of $120,000 helped the fledgling frontier city rebuild from the ashes. 2. You Can Find Authentic Mexican Tacos in a Dingy Mall   Photo (c)2014 Kerri Allen. All rights reserved.The Pacific Northwest is not known for its Latin culture, so it's astonishing to find authentic Mexico City-style tacos in Seattle. More astonishing is where you'll find them. On the ground level of the Broadway Alley Mall is a smoke shop, a body jewelry store and a sushi bar. But look up. A small foam-core sign dangling from the ceiling reads, ""Arriba, arriba, ándale, ándale,"" à la Speedy Gonzalez. It points to Tacos Chukis, a hidden restaurant on the second floor. In a small open kitchen a few guys sling wonderfully fresh, savory tacos, tortas and quesadillas. Wash 'em down with a bottle of gem-colored sugar known as Jarritos or the fresher rice milk horchata or hibiscus juice jamaica. Hurry, hurry.  3. The Starbucks Coffee Tastes Better You know how everyone says that Guinness tastes better in Ireland and bagels are better in New York because of some something-or-other in the water? I didn't realize a similar myth applies to Starbucks coffee in Seattle. At the franchise on East Olive Street in Capitol Hill, the Colombia Nariño blend has a richer flavor and smoother taste than the bitter blends I'm used to in New York. Also surprising and somewhat enchanting were the glass-enclosed rooms available for rent for meetings or parties. (Who knew some Starbucks even serve wine and beer?)   Photo (c)2014 Starbucks Corporation. All rights reserved.4. Cops Are Totally Chill About Marijuana Laws, Man Yes, pot is legal in Washington State, but no, you can't smoke it anywhere. As with alcohol, you may legally purchase and consume it inside of your own home. That said, the Seattle Police Department isn't quite enforcing that law. (Remember when cops doled out Doritos at last year's Hempfest?) A first offence will get you a warning; a second offense will cost you a whopping $27. A June 2014 story in Seattle Weekly quoted the city's police Sgt. Sean Whitcomb: ""The spirit of the law is voluntary compliance. If there's an opportunity for leniency, that's preferred."" Groovy.5. The Roast Beef Sandwich at Homegrown Will Blow Your Mind  It's hard not to roll my eyes at the ""sustainable sandwich shop"" with its guilt-inducing waste-bin labeling: Compost. Paper. Landfill. OK. I get it. Just give me a sandwich.Worth all of the shaming, however, is Homegrown, a eco-focused eatery inside of Melrose Market. A gauge-wearing, shaggy-faced hippie will slice up a singular roast beef sandwich with raw-milk swiss, pickled red onion, rosemary horseradish aioli and arugula to write home about. Bonus secret! Stay in the market after recycling your dishes and composting your biodegradable spork to check out Butter Home, a small shop full of farm-chic house wares and jewelry. (I nabbed a pair of ""x-stud"" earrings by Baleen). 6. The Space Needle is a Tourist Trap. Go Anyway. It took me a long time to understand what the Space Needle actually is, but like the Eiffel Tower in Paris or the Unisphere in Queens, N.Y. it's little more than a show-off structure with an observation tower. When America was in its Space Age phase, we were making things like the Space Needle as a projection of what a 21st century skyline would look like. (Eh, they were a bit off.)It's expensive and there's not a ton to do but walk around and look at the Seattle skyline, but it's worth it. Like a trip to the top of the Sears Tower or Empire State Building, it's a nice check off of the ol' bucket list and provides panoramic scenes to post online.  Photo (c)2014 Kerri Allen. All rights reserved.7. Watson Kennedy is a Preview of Heaven  Who is Watson Kennedy? Such a commanding, stately name. Is he a senator? A business mogul? No, it's the name of a store owned a man named Ted Kennedy Watson. Ted is the glorious curator and purveyor of beautiful and mostly useless objet. The Pike St. shop is a Seattle must-see for anyone who thrills at a bowl of antique silver bells or a bottle of Belberry fresh lime vinegar. (I unabashedly do.) Each section of this retail wonderland is arranged by color and style. Wander around the clustered vignettes while strains of Dinah Washington's greatest hits fill the lavender-scented air. That's one Seattle secret worth sharing.  Photo (c)2014 Kerri Allen. All rights reserved.This is not a sponsored post nor does it contain any affiliate links.

He wrote about his continuing commitment to a ""spirit of flexibility,"" flexibility that is completely lacking in Race to the Top mandates.",2014-08-25,"UNITED STATES - April 17 : Education Secretary Arne Duncan during the Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee 'The FY2014 Budget Request for the Education Department.' (Photo By Douglas Graham/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5babe45d2100002501c663eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Thursday, August 21, 2014, United States Secretary of Education Arne Duncan used his ""Homeroom"" blog to announce victory in his war on schools and teachers. After six years of decrying the inadequacy of education in the United States, Duncan ""celebrated that ""America's students have posted some unprecedented achievements in the last year."" In addition, after battling against teacher tenure and seniority rights, Duncan decided, ""we should celebrate America's teachers, principals, and students and their families.""After reiterating support for high-stakes testing at the center of Bush era ""No Child Left Behind"" requirements and the Obama administration's ""Race to the Top,"" Duncan conceded that ""in too many places, testing itself has become a distraction from the work it is meant to support"" and ""testing issues today are sucking the oxygen out of the room in a lot of schools."" I found three of Duncan's statements particularly ironic. He wrote about his continuing commitment to a ""spirit of flexibility,"" flexibility that is completely lacking in Race to the Top mandates. And instead of ending the onerous requirements that are creating the ""distraction"" and are ""sucking the oxygen,"" he postponed them for a year, granting states the ""opportunity to request a delay in when test results matter for teacher evaluation."" Curiously, one of Duncan's major partners in pushing Race to the Top, Common Core, and high-stakes testing, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is calling for a two year moratorium on using tests to evaluate teachers and students while we learn whether the testing policy actually makes sense.Duncan also acknowledged ""Too much testing can rob school buildings of joy, and cause unnecessary stress."" However, I did not think the problem was that buildings are unhappy and what did he think would happen to teachers and students being evaluated by high-stakes tests -- they would become relaxed?Finally Duncan expressed concern that ""adults are gaming tests, rather than using them to help students."" Isn't that what politicians and business do in the United States? Why should teachers and parents be any different? Perhaps Duncan should pay more attention to speeches by his boss President Barak Obama? In July 2014 President Obama called for a new ""economic patriotism"" and denounced ""corporate deserters"" who game the tax code by renouncing their United States ""citizenship to shield profits."" Since the 1980s over 40 U.S. corporations have switched their addresses to low-tax nations without really moving and according to Bloomberg News at least eight more companies are in the process of gaming the tax system.Duncan's blog is reminiscent of the famous George W. Bush May 1, 2003 ""Mission Accomplished"" speech on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln where the President celebrated the end of major combat operations by the United States in Iraq, a declaration that now appears to have been at least twelve years too early. The vast majority of casualties in the Iraq war occurred after the Bush speech and unfortunately the dismantling of education in the United States and the high-stakes testing war on schools and teachers will continue long after the Duncan blog.The U.S. Department of Education website where Duncan post's his blogs welcomes comments. My comment was that Duncan should resign. Either they were flooded with comments or they did not like mine, because as of this writing it does not appear."
12,FIFTY,Employment for the Ages,"Michael Hodin, ContributorCEO, Global Coalition on Aging",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/employment-for-the-ages_b_5699132.html,Britain is currently at the cusp of what the Financial Times has called the biggest reform to its pension system since it began a century ago.,2014-08-25,"George Osborne, U.K. chancellor of the exchequer, sits and listens during the Commonwealth Games Business Conference in Glasgow, U.K., on Tuesday, July 22, 2014. Scotland holds a referendum on Sept. 18, with the main political parties in London united in their opposition to the nationalists led by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb66c4e250000940039a2fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The latest U.S. figures on unemployment reveal a stunning gap between the official rate at about 6% and the more accurate if unofficial rate closer to double at about 12%. The two generally accepted explanations tend to be a profound and disturbing structural shift characterized boldly and accurately by the AEI Scholar, Nick Eberstadt that ""simply put, work in America has collapsed."" On the one side, there is the youth unemployment phenomenon, which seems to be about more than the Great Recession. But then there is also the equally disturbing fact that we persist in assuming a 20th century work/retirement model where the over 55 demographic is not really considered part of the workforce. Even if many of us do! As America's population ages, the parallel shift in allocation of resources, capital and talent are barely in sight. Moreover, from the retirement age to how we save (or not) for retirement seem still to be stuck in a 20th century demographic frame. A brief examination of three different locations -- UK, Germany and then right here in America's NYC -- reflect the stunning disconnect.   Britain's biggest pension reform in a century Britain is currently at the cusp of what the Financial Times has called the biggest reform to its pension system since it began a century ago. George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, has ended a rule that effectively forces pensioners to buy annuities in retirement. It may sound like a wonky sort of rule that only financiers understand, but the FT is right to claim the unprecedented significance. But Osborne's ruling probably won't go far enough. Like most of the developed world, Britain's feeling a nasty pinch as the 65+ population segment grows and the services they demand (medical, financial, social) increase in cost. Osborne's reform is right in that it's designed to spur market innovation for new financial products that fit 21st century health-spans and life-spans, but more needs to be done. Innovation in the financial sector is key to creating a sustainable economic model for an aging population. The British should push further in this direction. How can new instruments be created to encourage longer workforce participation? How can tax structures or investment vehicles incentive more saving and longer working lives? What products and services can be created to spur savings models that account for lives that stretch regularly into the 90s and 100s? As Sarah Harper, Director of the Oxford Institute on Ageing, has noted, one in three British girls born today will live to see 100. It'll take more than annuity reform to keep them financially sound for a century of life. Germany's turn for the worse In the wake of the Euro-austerity headache that lasted for years, the Germans earned the reputation as heartless spendthrifts. Whether Angela Merkel earned this reputation or whether it was irrational finger-pointing is beside the point. But recent developments in Germany regarding the lowering of the retirement age for certain demographic segments is puzzling - and fully incongruous with their prevailing reputation. Over the past few months, Germany - the fastest aging European nation - has lowered the retirement age from 65 to 63 for qualifying Germans. From an economic point of view, the move makes no sense. It's exactly the opposite of what Germany needs to do to maintain its economic strength as its population ages. German businesses have been wiser. The automaker BMW has built programs to keep older workers productive, and they've succeeded fabulously. Merkel should pay attention. Again, market innovation will be the key to 21st century success. The U.S. and Old New York The New York City Department of Aging has recently gotten an 8% increase in its budget under the new mayor. This is one of the largest percentage increases of any city agency, and the boost has been justified by the ballooning percentage of silver New Yorkers. By 2030, the ""elderly"" population will rise by 35%. Mayor de Blasio is right to recognize that investment is needed to get the right policies and programs in place for the aging Boomers, but New York's framework is still all wrong. The budget boost will be used to provide services of care, and it is framed almost entirely around models of aging that accept dependence and disability as the norm. To be sure, there are plenty of New Yorkers who need this kind of help, but the only way to prepare for the ballooning in aging is to create programs that incentivize work, entrepreneurship, independence, etc. New York will only be able to care for those who really need it if it stops caring for those who don't. A new 21st century understanding of aging must frame the mission of the Department of Aging, and it should ask itself: How can we build a ""silver economy"" that drives economic growth rather than simply manage care? Even more, for all of us across global economies, to stop thinking about aging as an aging issue, but as a core driver of 21st century economic growth and social value."
13,BUSINESS,How Upcoming FICO Credit Score Changes Might Rock the Economy,"Neal Frankle, ContributorFinancial planner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-coming-fico-credit-sc_b_5699406.html,"The aftermath of this change could be felt in the banking industry, the real estate market and it could even force interest rates higher. And that's just for starters.",2014-08-25,Workers are not reaping the gains of their extra productivity.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c45c91f00002d00212809.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Will FICO Score Changes Smack The Economy, Real Estate and The Stock Market?Starting this fall millions of people who up until now had lousy credit scores could see their FICO ranking dramatically improve almost overnight. As a result, they may have access to credit that was otherwise unavailable to them. Is their FICO score rising because they are all going to get together and make good on their past collective bad debts? No. This is happening because the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau negotiated with Fair Isaac (the company that generates FICO numbers) to change how they award points.This is an important development for everyone regardless of what your credit score is. The aftermath of this change could be felt in the banking industry, the real estate market and it could even force interest rates higher. And that's just for starters.What Is Happening?There are three dramatic changes that will inflate FICO scores:1. If someone had a bad debt they later paid off through collections, that bad debt won't affect FICO scores anymore.2. Any debt relating to medical problems will have less impact on scores. In fact, if the only bad debt someone has relates to a medical problem, those people might see an increase of 25 points or more in their FICO numbers.3. Fair Isaac will evaluate people with little credit history using a new algorithm that will give them a higher grade.How Are FICO Scores Used?FICO scores are widely used by banks, financial institutions, credit card issuers, auto and other lenders. According to Fair Isaac, 90 percent of all loans made in the United States rely on the borrowers' FICO score to determine if the loan will be made and if so what the appropriate interest rate will be. Many employers also consider FICO scores before hiring employees.Fair Isaac's FICO scores are ubiquitous. The company has been providing credit scores since 1989 and has developed a very accurate creditworthiness gauge. This may not be nice to say but if FICO says you aren't a good risk you probably shouldn't take the loan even if someone is willing to give you the money.Up until now, FICO has been the industry standard. But now the government is directing the firm to change their methodology.Why Are These Changes Being Made?The government feels that many low income individuals and minorities are shut out of the real estate market and denied credit unfairly because of past blemishes on their credit history. They hope this change will allow more of those people to buy homes and obtain more credit.Who Does This Help?You might think that this change will help people with low credit scores. I'm not so sure. FICO scores are supposed to reflect the risk that financial institutions take when they extend credit. This change inflates scores but it doesn't change the risk to the lender. Sure there will be some people who will be able to afford these loans but many will not if history is any judge.The Potential PitfallsAs I explained above, the market has voted and named FICO the most reliable and useful credit evaluation tool there is. If that goes out the window and lenders are forced to make loans to people they otherwise would not loan to, defaults could rise. That means many of the people this is meant to help actually get hurt. It also might damage the real estate market and the overall economy if things get out of hand.The Bottom LineIt's difficult to say how this change in FICO score ratings will play out. Banks could tighten their lending standards or sue the government and tie this up in court. But this is an important news item to watch and consider as you make investment and real estate decisions going forward.Are you concerned about this change in FICO scoring? Why or why not?"
14,SPORTS,5 Reasons Jameis Winston Could Become The Second-Ever Repeat Heisman Champion,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jameis-winston_n_5697952.html,,2014-08-25,"NEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 14: Jameis Winston, quarterback of the Florida State Seminoles, hoist the trophy during a press conference after the 2013 Heisman Trophy Presentation at the Marriott Marquis on December 14, 2013 in New York City. (Photo by Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb76b3924000030009887e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The annual Heisman Trophy fodder is as much a part of college football as the weekly rankings and games themselves. And, as we recently explored, there are five elite candidates to knock Florida State University's reigning Heisman champ Jameis Winston off his perch. But Winston is chasing history, hoping to become the second-ever two-time winner since the award's inception in 1935. (Ohio State's Archie Griffin did so almost 40 years ago.) And by now you know that Winston is not your average sophomore, with his 44 combined touchdowns plus a national championship. With that in mind, here are five reasons the Alabama native could repeat as Heisman Trophy winner.Scratching The SurfaceHis remarkable on-field command can mask the fact that Winston is still just 20 years old, but another year in Jimbo Fisher's system is a scary thought. Winston completed a stellar 67 percent of his passes as a redshirt freshman, but did so with choppy footwork and, at times, a long, wind-up delivery. These elements of his game should improve as he prepares for the next level.A Little Help From His FriendsDon't forget that Fisher has signed a top-10 class every year since he got the job in 2010. The Seminoles are returning 13 starters in 2014, including John Mackey award finalist (given to the nation's best tight end) Nick O'Leary. As a junior last season, O'Leary nabbed 33 passes for 557 yards and seven touchdowns, and perhaps more importantly, already has the most career touchdowns for a tight end at Florida State, with 11. The loss of 1,000-yard receiver Kelvin Benjamin and running back Devonta Freeman to the NFL Draft surely hurts, but between O'Leary's versatility and the emergence of multifaceted weapons Karlos Williams and Rashad Greene, Winston will have plenty of weapons.Cupcake CityThe ACC is not a very good league right now, and the fact that FSU gets Notre Dame at home is a huge plus. Both the Clemson and Florida games are in Tallahassee as well, which means that another undefeated regular season is very much on the table. Winston should be able to produce the gaudy numbers and the wins that come along with being a Heisman winner, a la 2014.Pressure PlayerWinston, per ESPN The Magazine, ranked first overall in completion percentage under duress, nearly doubling the average rating for quarterbacks. It appears no stage is too big for him, and the national title game against Auburn is a prime example. The game-winning drive he orchestrated looked more like the work of a seasoned pro than a redshirt freshman. ConfidenceCall him brash or arrogant, it really doesn't matter. ""I've got this perception about me that Jameis is cocky, overconfident,"" he told ESPN The Magazine. ""If you hold yourself to a certain standard, people are going to talk. But that's you being yourself."" Did you catch the third-person reference? The funny thing is that before he was a household name, the nation's No. 1 overall quarterback recruit in 2012 possessed the same belief in himself. In that regard, Winston isn't entirely dissimilar to former Heisman winner Johnny Manziel. Both are great, and they will tell you they are great.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7edea240000500098abef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) An American doctor treated for Ebola, Kent Brantly, was discharged from Atlanta’s Emory University Hospital Thursday (Aug. 21). Another American aid worker, Nancy Writebol, was discharged Tuesday (Aug. 19).“God saved my life,” said Brantly, looking gaunt, at a press conference Thursday, at which the room applauded his appearance. He thanked his medical team and the millions of people around the world praying for his recovery. “Please do not stop praying for the people of West Africa.”Bruce Ribner, medical director of the hospital’s infectious disease unit, said Brantly will go to an undisclosed location with his wife and children after the press conference.Brantly and Writebol, a volunteer with SIM USA, were flown to Emory from West Africa in early August and were treated in the hospital’s specialized unit.Ribner said the hospital performed extensive blood and urine tests on both patients and consulted with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before deciding the two missionaries were ready to be released. Neither pose any risk to the public, he said. Five doctors and 21 nurses cared for Brantly and Writebol during their stay.In his statement, Brantly said his family arrived in Liberia last November and he saw his first Ebola patient in June. “We took every precaution to protect ourselves from this dreaded disease,” Brantly said.On July 23, just a few days after sending his family home, however, Brantly said he woke up feeling sick, and soon learned that he was infected.Writebol chose not to make a statement. However, Brantly related that, as she left her isolation unit, she said, “To God be the glory.”Ribner said he hopes what he and his colleagues learned about treating Ebola can help save other patients in Africa.While in Liberia, Brantly received a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor.Both Brantly and Writebol received doses of an experimental drug, called Zmapp, which includes man-made antibodies against Ebola. Although Zmapp has shown promise in animals, it has not yet been tested in humans. Experts have said it’s not possible to conclude that Zmapp cured their disease, although getting good supportive care at Emory, one of the world’s best hospitals, likely improved their chances of survival.“If the question is, ‘Did Zmapp do this?’ The answer is that we just don’t know,” says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. “People who are in much less sophisticated medical care conditions in West Africa are recovering 50 percent of the time.”Without a carefully designed trial — involving a comparison group that doesn’t receive the drug — doctors can’t make conclusions about how a treatment works. About half of Ebola patients in the current outbreak are surviving without the experimental drug. But a Spanish priest who received Zmapp died, Fauci says.Three Liberian health workers also received Zmapp. The drug’s manufacturer, Mapp Biopharmaceutical of San Diego, has said there is no more of the drug left.According to CNN, two blood tests done over a two-day period had to come back negative for Ebola before Brantly could be discharged. David Writebol, Nancy’s husband, was released from quarantine earlier this week. Doctors had observed him for three weeks, monitoring him for signs of fever. Ebola can have an incubation period of up to 21 days.People generally aren’t considered contagious unless they have symptoms of Ebola, such as fever.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent at least 50 staff to West Africa to help contain the epidemic.“We must re-commit to doing all we can to increase their chances of survival and to stop the spread of Ebola,” said CDC director Thomas Frieden in a statement. “This outbreak is unprecedented, and it’s likely to get worse before it gets better. We must respond in unprecedented way to stop the outbreak as soon as possible.”In concluding his statement, Brantly said he is “glad for any attention my sickness has attracted to the plight of West Africa in the midst of this epidemic. Please continue to pray for Liberia and the people of West Africa, and encourage those in positions of leadership and influence to do everything possible to bring this Ebola outbreak to an end.Samaritan’s Purse, the Christian humanitarian organization for which Brantly works, released this statement from its president, Franklin Graham, Thursday (Aug. 21):Today I join all of our Samaritan’s Purse team around the world in giving thanks to God as we celebrate Dr. Kent Brantly’s recovery from Ebola and release from the hospital. Over the past few weeks, I have marveled at Dr. Brantly’s courageous spirit as he has fought this horrible virus with the help of the highly competent and caring staff at Emory University Hospital. His faithfulness to God and compassion for the people of Africa have been an example to us all.I know that Dr. Brantly and his wonderful family would ask that you please remember and pray for those in Africa battling, treating and suffering from Ebola. Those who have given up the comforts of home to serve the suffering and the less fortunate are in many ways just beginning this battle.We have more than 350 staff in Liberia, and others will soon be joining them, so please pray for those who have served with Dr. Brantly — along with the other doctors, aid workers and organizations that are at this very moment desperately trying to stop Ebola from taking any more lives."

These days, the actress steps out in some serious designer duds, and did not disappoint at the 2014 Emmy Awards. She looked lovely in a black Marchesa skirt, but we have to admit we're even more obsessed with those gorgeous waves. Either way, we're still keeping our fingers crossed for McCarthy to land a hosting gig at one of these shows already. What do you think of the look?PHOTOS:See the rest of the Emmys red carpet:"
