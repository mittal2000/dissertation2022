Shy and introverted off the field, Alonso is making a significant statement on it. Four weeks into the season, the second-round draft pick out of Oregon has been among the NFL's most dominant rookies. (AP Photo/Bill Wippert, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7155a250000360039d0e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Len Pasquarelli, National Football PostNo linebacker has ever led the NFL in interceptions for a season, and none probably ever will, but Buffalo rookie middle linebacker Kiko Alonso certainly has a pretty good chance to top his position in pickoffs in 2013.A second-round choice in April, the 46th prospect taken overall and the fifth linebacker selected in this draft, the former University of Oregon star already has four interceptions, twice as many as any other ‘backer in the league, in his first five starts. In fact, no other NFL rookie linebacker yet has a single interception. The four interceptions tie Alonso with a pair of cornerbacks, New England’s Aqib Talib and Alterraun Verner of Tennessee, for the NFL lead.At this point, Alonso, who was named the league’s defensive rookie of the month for September, has accounted for 13.3 percent of the 30 total linebacker interceptions league-wide. At a time when some of the players chosen ahead of Alonso six months ago are having solid but not spectacular seasons, the Buffalo rookie has thrived.“He’s just got great straightline speed,” Bills’ strongside linebacker Manny Lawson said of the rookie. “He explodes to the ball.”There have been other rookie linebackers, however, who timed quicker than Alonso entering the NFL, and several possessed similar burst in their physical skills-sets. He didn’t run at the combine, but clocked a 4.72-second time at his pro day, which was bettered by 10 linebacker prospects at the combine.So what has made the Bills’ rookie, who has registered four passes defensed in addition to the interceptions and also has a forced fumble, so immediately effective in coverage? Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco, who tossed five “picks” to Buffalo defenders a couple weeks ago, including a pair to Alonso, cited the first-year star’s “length” as a factor and said he is difficult to throw over. Granted at 6-feet-3, Alonso is taller than a lot of the 4-3 middle linebackers in the league, but there are also a few in his height range. His arm length at the combine workouts in February was 32 1/8 inches, and there were 29 of the 35 linebackers at the Indianapolis sessions who measured longer reaches.It should be noted that Alonso also has 44 tackles, among the top 10 in the NFL, and the most for any rookie defender. It is his coverage skill, though, that clearly has caught the eye of coaches around the league. Not only can Alonso get out into the shorter “flat” and “swing” zones, but he has been very adept at getting depth in the middle of the field and sitting in passing lanes.To Bills’ defensive coordinator Mike Pettine, it is Alonso’s football instincts and the fact he’s been forced to “play fast,” which have helped set him apart. “His (football) awareness is great,” Pettine said. “He’s got great feel for what’s going on.” Another element that Philadelphia assistant secondary coach Todd Lyght, who was part of the Oregon staff during Alonso’s two seasons as a starter, noted was the fact that the ‘backer practiced every day against an up-tempo offense that threw a lot of looks at the defenders. “He’s seen a lot already . . . and he’s lined up against about everything that you can imagine,” Lyght said.In his two seasons as an Oregon starter, Alonso demonstrated solid coverage ability, with six interceptions, including four in 2012. But even those impressive numbers didn’t unanimously sell league scouts on his abilities to drop and cover. Yet just a month into his professional career, Alonso is only the fourth linebacker in history to post four September interceptions. He is only the second linebacker in franchise history to have at least four interceptions in a season. In the past 10 seasons, there have been only 10 linebackers with more than four thefts in a year.There was some uncertainty about where Alonso would project when league scouts evaluated him in the spring. Scouts were split about whether Alonso would be best utilized on the outside or in the middle. But the Bills’ staff pretty much projected him quickly as a “Mike” candidate. Said one team official: “He’s everything you want in (a middle linebacker), really. A lot of guys at the position are two-down players who come off the field on third down. If you get a player who can play there and stay there (on third down), it’s a bonus.”Notable is that all but one of the linebackers in league history with 30 interceptions or more were middle linebackers for most of their careers. In recent seasons, guys such as London Fletcher and Brian Cushing led the NFL in interceptions by ‘backers from middle or inside spots. It’s awful early in his career to compare Alonso to some of those defenders, but he’s definitely making a splash right now.AROUND THE LEAGUE*The Atlanta tag-team of general manager Thomas Dimitroff and coach Mike Smith has garnered rave reviews, and deservedly so, during its stint of five-plus seasons together. When the pair arrived, after all, the Falcons were still reeling from the Michael Vick and Bobby Petrino disasters, and were essentially irrelevant even in their own town, and the two piloted the Falcons to playoff berths in four of their first five seasons. But with a 1-4 start, it’s probably fair to nit-pick a bit, even considering the rash of injuries that has beset the team.Earlier this year, the “Sunday Blitz” noted the failure of the team’s brass to draft and develop a viable pass-rush threat, and to have to rely instead on trade and free agency to supply rushmen. So far this season, the offensive line should merit the same kind of scrutiny. There have been some nettlesome constants with the Falcons – the injuries, “red zone” and third-down conversion failures, not finishing drives or winning close games – but the problems on the offensive line might trump them all. And, frankly, are likely responsible for some of the shortcomings. Dimitroff and Smith made a conscious decision to release right tackle Tyson Clabo and to not try to talk center Todd McClure out of retirement, the way they did tight end Tony Gonzalez. McClure suggested this week that he would have come back for a 15th season, but that he was nudged toward retirement, as the team opted to go with younger players on the line.But the younger players haven’t worked out. Former second-rounder Peter Konz, who moved over from right guard to replace McClure, has struggled against some of the league’s stronger tackles. Right guard Garrett Reynolds, who lost the starting job each of the past two seasons, likewise has been bullied at times. And second-year tackle Lamar Holmes, a third-round pick in 2012 whom the Falcons appear to have over-drafted, clearly isn’t ready yet for prime time. Holmes, who played only seven snaps as a rookie, began the season at right tackle, then switched to the left side when Sam Baker was injured. To shore up the tackle position, the team was forced to sign journeyman Jeremy Trueblood. The result of the mess: Matt Ryan, the club’s $100 million quarterback has been hit way too often (despite being sacked only eight times), a reality that must make owner Arthur Blank blanch.In six drafts, Dimitroff and Blank have chosen seven offensive line prospects, and only Baker has played passably well. And some locals would argue that the six-year, $40.85 million extension to which the club signed Baker in the offseason was misplaced largesse. Smith and Dimitroff have done a tremendous job with the Falcons, to be sure, but they’ve made some mistakes as well. And right now, those draft misjudgments are biting the team. Smith last week demined it “preposterous” when asked if the team’s slow start might prompt the Falcons to deal Gonzalez to a Super Bowl contender. We’d employ the same term to any suggestions a continued slide could put Smith and/or Dimitroff in trouble. But it’s certainly fair to cite the “misses” they’ve had on the offensive line.*There might not be the kind of feeding frenzy for an Oregon game this season as existed at Louisville on Thursday night, when roughly two dozen NFL scouts descended on Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium to eyeball firsthand standout Louisville quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. But before the scouts anoint Bridgewater as the top quarterback prospect in the 2014 draft, and perhaps the No. 1 player overall, a lot of talent evaluators want the same kind of chance to scrutinize Oregon’s Marcus Mariota. Bridgewater was “very, very solid,” according to one of the area scouts who attended Thursday night’s victory over Rutgers. But according to the scout, who was reached by NFP at the airport before he boarded a mid-morning flight to go see a Saturday game, the Cardinals’ star “didn’t close the deal, not that I expected him to.” Playing without his top receiver, the injured Davante Parker, Bridgewater threw for 310 yards, his accuracy and velocity were reportedly good, and he demonstrated good pocket presence. But Mariota has created some buzz of late, as has UCLA’s Brett Hundley, and it’s “way, way too early,” the scout said, to declare that a player “is the No. 1 anything right now.”*Most of the culpability for the New York Giants’ dismal 0-6 start is being laid at the feet of the offense. Or, more accurately, at the right arm of Eli Manning, who’s thrown a horrendous 15 interceptions, already as many as he tossed in all of 2012 and only one fewer than he threw in 2011. The criticism of the unit and of Manning has been earned, for sure. But the New York defense isn’t blameless, particularly a pass rush that has produced only five sacks. In coach Tom Coughlin’s previous nine seasons with the franchise, the Giants never had fewer than 11 sacks after a half-dozen games, and averaged 17.2 sacks in the first six contests. But the consistent pressure that has marked Coughlin’s tenure with the club hasn’t been there, and a lot of people are noting that end Jason Pierre-Paul, who has just one sack, simply isn’t the same player he was only two years ago. In 2011, JPP notched 16.5 sacks. But he fell off to only 6.5 in 2012, and it certainly looks like injuries (back and knee) have caught up to him. In his last 22 outings, Pierre-Paul has only 7.5 sacks, just one in his last 13 games. Two years ago, JPP registered five multiple-sack games. He’s posted only one in the 22 games since. One tackle who played against Pierre-Paul this year suggested to NFP that the former first-rounder is hurting. “He must be,” the tackle said. “The explosiveness isn’t there. With those speed guys, if they’re not (physically) right, they have problems. Even the counter moves that he was starting to develop have fallen off.”*The defense for New York’s “other” franchise has been solid, especially against the rush, and that’s in large part attributable to a front three that has emerged as one of the NFL’s premier line units. The Jets’ front includes a pair of former first-rounders, Muhammad Wilkerson (2011) and Sheldon Richardson (2013), and they have keyed a resurgence. Wilkerson felt he should have gone to the Pro Bowl a year ago, and he is playing at that level again in 2013. All but two of the members of the Jets’ front seven have three or fewer years of experience, and that bodes well for the defense.“We feel like we can play with anyone,” linebacker David Harris told NFP after the club’s victory at Atlanta last week. It’s ironic that coach Rex Ryan has been known in some quarters for the pressure his defenses have exerted on quarterbacks. But the reality is that the bodacious Ryan’s defenses have never been great rush units, but historically good versus the run. That’s the case again this year, but New York has actually been good all the way around, as typified by its No. 2 overall ranking. In Ryan’s first three seasons with the franchise, despite twice reaching the conference title game, the Jets were always 28th or worse statistically. Last season, they rose to No. 8, and they’ve really made a jump in 2013.*Oakland probably won’t win a lot of games, and the Raiders’ streak of non-playoff years likely will extend to 11 seasons, but very quietly one of the bigger surprises of the early portion of this campaign has been the continued progress of third-year veteran quarterback Terrelle Pryor. The former supplemental draft choice has started to demonstrate more touch on his passes, better patience in the pocket, and what one Oakland assistant characterized as “a good sense for game situations.” The maturing of Pryor probably didn’t convince the Raiders to jettison veteran Matt Flynn – the Oakland coaches had already decided he was a mistake – but it might have kept them from going hard after free agent Josh Freeman last week. Oakland offensive coordinator Greg Olson, who coached Freeman in his first three seasons in the league, pushed some for the Raiders to add the former Tampa Bay starter. But the Raiders, brass prefers that Pryor understand he’s the starter, not have to look over his shoulder, and continue his growth pattern. Pryor has the second-most running attempts (37) and rushing yards (229) of any quarterback in the league, but the Raiders’ staff doesn’t feel he’s been too quick to abandon the pocket. His 97.6 passer rating is the eighth best among quarterbacks with at least three starts, and his 8.1-yards per attempt average is very good as well.“Everyone knew all along he was a great athlete . . . but I always felt, ever since I saw him in his workouts before the (2011) supplemental draft, that he would surprise people with how well he threw the ball,” longtime NFL personnel chief Ken Herock, who still has some ties to the Raiders, told NFP. “There’s something to build on there.” Herock credits former Cincinnati quarterback Ken Anderson, who hasn’t yet reached the “quarterback guru” status of some, but who worked extensively with Pryor in 2011, for providing the youngster a solid base.*On the subject of quarterback development from the class of 2011 – or, in some cases, lack thereof – the first round from that year certainly isn’t looking too good. Three years into their careers, Cam Newton (No. 1 overall), Jake Locker (No. 8), Blaine Gabbert (No. 10) and Christian Ponder (No. 12) haven’t exactly lit things up, have they? There are some who have seen Carolina’s Newton this season and feel that he has regressed a bit in terms of decision-making and awareness in the pocket. In fairness, Locker has been hurt some for Tennessee, But Gabbert is barely clinging to his job – he won’t play this week because of a hamstring injury and Chad Henne, who will get the start, has taken nearly as many snaps -- and it won’t be surprising if the Jaguars choose a potential replacement in the ’14 draft. Remember, the current Jacksonville leadership group inherited Gabbert from its predecessors, and isn’t as tied to him. Ponder is said to be healthy again, but Matt Cassel is expected to start Sunday for a second game in a row, and the Vikings will shell out a $3 million salary to provide Freeman an audition of sorts over the balance of the season. As noted in last week’s “Sunday Blitz,” the tackle position is gaining some ground on quarterback in the “boom or bust” category. But the 2011 draft, at least in the first round, reminds that quarterback remains the ultimate hit-or-miss position.*No matter who is throwing the ball in Jacksonville next year, they could have a big-time wide receiver catching it. Second-year veteran Justin Blackmon returned last week from his four-week suspension for violation of the NFL’s substance abuse policy and had a strong game, with five catches for 136 yards. The Jaguars aligned the former Oklahoma State star in at least three different spots, including in the slot, and he demonstrated the strength to “out-physical” defensive backs in all of them. “He’s definitely a handful,” St. Louis cornerback Janoris Jenkins said afterwards. Team officials feel the forced hiatus from the game matured Blackmon as well. “He doesn’t like to sit,” one assistant told NFP, “and, while it was a hard lesson, maybe it’s (a lesson that) will stick.” Although his rookie campaign was regarded by many as disappointing, Blackmon did catch 64 passes for 865 yards and five touchdowns in 2012, well above the average for the last 20 years for first-round wide receivers. In the final four games, he had 25 receptions for 308 yards and two scores.*Think first-year Kansas City coach Andy Reid didn’t know what he was doing when he essentially hand-picked Alex Smith to be his quarterback in the reclamation project with the Chiefs? Reid knows something, of course, about quarterback play in the NFL, and about the priorities and mentality of the position. And while the former San Francisco starter, and onetime top overall draft pick, probably doesn’t have the raw physical talent of some of Reid’s starters at Philadelphia, neither does he bring some of the same baggage as did Donovan McNabb or Michael Vick. Smith ranks only about the middle of the league pack in passer rating (83.7) and his completion mark (58.4 percent) is fairly mundane in a league where a minimum 60 percent has become the new normal, but the guy is a winner, teammates and coaches agree. And he’s basically “got no ego,” one Kansas City defensive veteran told NFP. Smith is 24-5-1 in his last 30 starts and has clearly made a difference for the Chiefs on the field and in the locker room as well.SHORT YARDAGE*Offensive left tackle Eugene Monroe didn’t play for Baltimore last week after being acquired from the Jaguars in a trade. But the former first-rounder, who most observers feel will upgrade the Ravens at the line’s most critical spot, worked with the first unit all week and almost certainly will make his first start on Sunday against Green Bay. The consensus in the league is that general manager Ozzie Newsome made a wise deal in netting Monroe for fourth- and fifth-round picks, especially since the Ravens figure to earn several compensatory choices in ’14. One key will be whether Baltimore can retain Monroe, who is eligible for free agency next spring. . . . The Ravens, by the way, are starting to stress the run game more again, as tailback Ray Rice returns to health. One team scout acknowledged that the Ravens had “maybe become a little too (enamored)” of the pass, and had gone away some from their usual mix. . . . Despite his contention that it was a “difficult” decision last week to stick with struggling quarterback Matt Schaub for Sunday’s game against St. Louis, folks in Houston contend that coach Gary Kubiak did not agonize as much as he insisted he did. For all his “pick six” foibles, Schaub still gives the Texans the best chance to reverse their slide. . . . Giants’ second-year wide receiver Rueben Randle already has more receptions and yards, and just as many touchdowns, as he did in 16 games in 2012. But the former LSU star hasn’t been as sharp in his route-running and route conversions as he was as a rookie, and that’s hurt the New York offense. . . . As noted above in regards to Bridgewater, league scouts aren’t going to start drawing conclusions about 2014 draft prospects in October, but to suggest that South Carolina defensive end Jadeveon Clowney hasn’t commanded some negative attention with his injury and attitude problems would be a mistake. Scouts definitely have taken notice of Clowney’s performances on and off the field in the first month-plus of the season. . . . Smith no doubt has been the Chiefs’ most valuable offensive player, but it’s notable that tailback Jamaal Charles is the only player in the NFL to lead his team in rushing attempts and yards, and receptions and receiving yards. . . . Representatives for the deposed Flynn, who’s earned a ton of money the past two years for a guy who has started just one game and been tossed aside by two franchises, are calling around the league to try to generate interest. They’ve gotten a couple nibbles, but nothing solid yet. . . . It will be interesting to see if the injury-ravaged Falcons get walking wounded tailback Steven Jackson back on the field after their bye this week. Jackson, who has missed the past 3.5 games because of a hamstring/thigh injury, missed only two games with the Rams the past four seasons. But there are some in St. Louis who privately contend Jackson was a slower healer than advertised, and that he often felt his production was impacted by playing hurt. Some of those same critics note that Jackson has insisted he will not return to the Atlanta lineup until 100 percent.BY THE NUMBERS*In completing 18 of 23 passes for 221 yards, with two touchdowns and no interceptions, in last week’s 27-17 victory over San Diego, Terrelle Pryor registered a 135.7 quarterback rating. It represented the highest single-game rating for an Oakland starter since Rich Gannon posted a 138.9 mark in a Sept. 29, 2002 game against Tennessee. The streak in between those two contests: A staggering 177 games. During the streak, Oakland starters compiled ratings of 100 or more just 34 times, with Gannon and Carson Palmer notching seven each among the 11 quarterbacks who accomplished the feat. But, remarkably, Raiders’ starters actually had more games (38) with quarterback ratings under 50 during the streak. "

""Every major institution is being corrupted.""""A very vicious thing that's just growing like a hydra-headed monster."" ""The very future of our nation is at risk.""And finally: ""It's not only foreign terrorists that we need to fear today. The most dangerous radicals who threaten our way of life are those who live among us. They already hold positions of esteem in government, the courts, our schools and colleges, and even the world of business; and you can be certain they will destroy us if we do not take steps to defeat their radical agenda now.""It all sounds very scary, like Sen. Joe McCarthy's rantings about a Communist conspiracy to take over the country. But since the collapse of the Soviet Union, even the most paranoid among us have calmed down a bit about the threat of Communists undermining our democratic institutions and seizing control of the government. So that can't be it. Perhaps a few of the hardest of the hardcore anti-Communist crazies have shifted their focus to Sharia law, convinced that it has already taken over Dearborn, Mich., and is about to invade their local probate court. But Sharia law is not what these people are talking about either. What they are talking about is the dreaded ""homosexual agenda"" -- that is, a vast homosexual conspiracy that they believe is seizing control of the country. In fact, the last two quotations are taken, respectively, from The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today by Alan Sears and Craig Osten and The Agenda: The Homosexual Plan to Change America by Rev. Louis P. Sheldon. Some of these homosexual-conspiracy theorists actually believe that there is a strategy guide or playbook that homosexual activists have been using for years to enable them to subvert the entire culture. In fact, Sears and Osten base much of their book on this idea. That supposed playbook is called After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the '90s. It was written by Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen. Sears and Osten talk about Kirk and Madsen as if they were Marx and Engels. Hunter Madsen is much more modest in his assessment of the book. In 2006 he wrote:[W]hile the book was widely read (and, in most cases, excoriated) by gay activists when it was first published, in 1989, and while a great many of its techniques have obviously been employed by activists since then, I see no evidence that the book itself serves as any kind of reference for the movement today.But here's the really funny thing: Sears and Osten are outraged at what they perceive to be the incredibly Machiavellian activist strategies advocated by Kirk and Madsen, strategies that include such subversive recommendations as ""make gays look good"" and ""solicit funds."" But what they and the entire religious right find most disturbing, what they find truly shocking, is what they say is the ultimate goal of Kirk and Madsen, a goal that they say defines the so-called ""homosexual agenda."" That goal is for homosexuals -- indeed for the entire LGBTQ community -- to be accepted as regular people just like everybody else. And you know what? They're right! That is the goal! That is the agenda. How horrible!Here's the point: Sexual orientation and gender identity are essential elements of human identity. If you vilify and demonize people because of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity, then you are engaged in bigotry. If you believe that being gay, lesbian, bisexual and/or transgender is unnatural and perverted, if you believe that LGBTQ people have no right to marry, indeed if you believe that LGBTQ people have no right to have sex because sex with another human being of one's own gender is immoral, then you are engaged in bigotry. It doesn't help if you base your bigoted judgments on a religious belief. It actually makes it worse. It means that you are making the absolutely preposterous claim that the creator of the universe backs you up in your demonization of an entire group of people based on who they are. You have your own playbook called the Bible, which you believe was authored by the creator of the universe, and that that book says that homosexuality is contrary to nature, that engaging in homosexual sex is morally wrong, and that everyone who engages in homosexual sex is going to hell. You agree.As I've said before, even if the Bible is authored by God, and even if God condemns people based on their sexual orientation and/or gender identity, that doesn't make it right. That just makes God a bigot. That just makes God a bad god. Shame on him.In the final analysis, it's really simple: The homosexual agenda, indeed the LGBTQ agenda, is the human agenda: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If you oppose that, then you are a bigot, even if you believe that the creator of the universe agrees with you."

I went in expecting a smart little drag show, but I walked away breathless and in awe of one of the most talented writer/performers of our time.I shouldn't have been surprised. The Obie-winning Drake has floored me time after time with the precision of his craft both as an actor and as a writer. But Tawny, as directed by the awesome Robert LaFosse, takes things to a whole new level. It's not just Drake's impeccable comic timing or his unmatched talent as a storyteller. It's the way in which he seamlessly weaves a series of gorgeously written stream-of-consciousness monologues through the unlikely vehicle of a maturing blonde bombshell that sets this show in a class of its own. And I'm not alone in my praise. Michael Musto of the Village Voice notes in his review: Drake has more than just show biz mockery in mind. As Tawny talks of visitations from AFOs (Angels Flying Overhead), Jesus, and the chicken from Hee Haw, it's clear that she's opened herself to the universe and connected with all its spirits and inspirations, both past and future. What results is a subtle, surprising theater piece with music, miles away from the resolutely earthbound drag shows you'll usually encounter.I caught up with Drake as he prepped for the show's Oct. 19 opening.Scott Alexander Hess: I adored the show last year. What should I expect this time? New material or the same brilliance?David Drake: Since I haven't performed Tawny Heatherton since the last gig, in a whole nine months, it's been like giving birth all over again. And she's changed, as have I this year, mostly because I've been working so much on other projects, and they've helped me grow tremendously. Last spring I had the great privilege of acting in the world premiere of Ryan Landry's inspired adaptation of Fritz Lang's M at the Huntington Theatre in Boston, where I played Fritz. Then I had this amazing experience of performing along with a cast of 11 phenomenal actors in the 20th-anniversary Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS benefit of my new ensemble adaptation of The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me, which really brought me back to my performing roots in a core way. So this new outing with Tawny, Tell Me True has deepened my needs to give this creation of Tawny that so unexpectedly came into my life two yeas ago to an audience. She's still brimming with hope and sunshine, but the shadows have lengthened too. Plus there's a batch of new jokes, a more sophisticated staging and arrangement for my opening number (thanks to my brilliant collaborators, director Robert La Fosse and onstage accompanist Lance Cruce) and, of course, a new dress! Hess: Tawny is the niece of 1970s icon Joey Heatherton. What first attracted you to Joey? Drake: As a kid growing up, watching her sing and dance on TV variety shows, and in those iconic Serta Mattress commercials, Joey was a gunshot blast of magic into my showbiz-craving imagination. Plus, as a little gay boy, I was attracted to her androgyny. Her obvious sultry qualities aside, Joey always had that boyish blond bob of hair (which was always shuffling around her eyes) and a kind of wily, childlike quality in her body and its movements. And since I started doing musical theater as a little kid, Joey's fierce singing and dancing were inspiring. Of course, when Tawny was born, it was because I'd flipped a platinum wig on backwards, and because the hair was hanging in my face as I looked in the mirror, I immediately thought of Joey. Tawny is a way of paying homage to the great Joey Heatherton that says, ""Joey, you are loved. You are missed. Your impression on our culture lives on. And, for your 'purported' niece, Tawny, we would like you to come home. We miss you!""Hess: What would Tawny say to Miley Cyrus right now? Drake: ""Listen to what makes your heart pound: Those are your instincts. Hear them. Follow them. Give us all you got, baby!""Hess: Your show is brilliant. Why did you take a nonlinear approach? And what fiction writers, if any, inspired you?Drake: Tawny's mind thinks in a nonlinear fashion. She's totally in the moment, with the audience right there, and because she comes from a showbiz family, the audience is one of her most familiar, trusted and intimate sources of friendship. As her creator, I knew from the the first monologue I wrote (detailing how she got estranged from Aunt Joey in the parking lot at the Mohegan Sun Casino one night, and how Tawny was drawn to a large mound of dirt out there) that Tawny was connected to loss and the natural elements. All monologues that followed were anchored in natural elements: air, water, earth, fire. Tawny may look like a showgirl, but she's really a hippie-girl goddess. ""Burning Girl""! As for the structure in the writing, I've loved the way Dale Peck, Scott Heim and John Weir organize time, character and memory in their novels. Plus, they always have such surprises of humor! That's inside my writing of Tawny as well, I think. Hess: Wow. Dale Peck was one of my grad school professors at The New School and helped guide me to publishing my debut novel Diary of a Sex Addict. Small world! I met Scott Heim while in grad school too. So you are heading to Buffalo with the show. Isn't Buffalo chilly for a beach girl like Tawny? Drake: The Nickel City certainly is chilly! But that's why the organizers of the ALTER/d art festival are bringing in Tawny: for the sunshine! The festival is all about art that acts as illustrations of transformations. As Tawny is a one-hit wonder who's never lost the wonder, she's a welcome informant of how to transform despair into hope. I've been booked to do Tawny there for over a year now and am really looking forward to it. Personally, I've only been in Buffalo once before -- in a airplane layover during a snowstorm they called a whiteout. Tawny's recollections of Buffalo are a bit sketchy. She thinks she might have been there in a blackout.Tawny, Tell Me True runs Oct. 19, 25 and 26 at 7:30 p.m. at the Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York City."

Before I could even get to the ubiquitous announcement of an upcoming burlesque show (you all should come visit Cleveland!), I paused and thought, ""Well, good! I do so like when the notable gays speak out against the anti-gay despots. Who was it? What'd he say?""The celebrity in question was David Bromstad. As a pop culture aficionado, I was a little miffed that I didn't know the name. A quick search revealed that he's some designer on HGTV, a genre of programming in which I no longer indulge, as I'm still recovering from the firing of Paige Davis on Trading Spaces. (Her brief return in 2008 did nothing to assuage the pain.) As the story goes, David will be hosting a charity event for the Salvation Army, a surprising move given the organization's notoriously anti-gay past. And by ""notoriously anti-gay"" I mean that it was barely a year ago that one of their press people publicly implied that the gays should be executed. Oh, and also, they only provide domestic partner benefits where required by law, allegedly fired a woman for coming out as bisexual, and reserve the right to make hiring decisions based on moral compatibility. But no matter! Our intrepid HGTV designer defended his position by putting out a statement noting his status as a celebrity (do actual celebrities call themselves celebrities?) and stating, ""I applaud the Salvation Army's symbolic handshake towards acceptance and would be foolish to not extend my hand in acceptance.""OK, David, let's do a minor reality check. Inviting a local ""celebrity"" to host a $110-per-ticket local event in which the celebrity's name gets top billing above the description of the event in an effort to sell tickets? Well, that's just sound fundraising. Unless the Salvation Army releases a statement linking the booking of Bromstad to a change in their policies, it isn't a handshake, it isn't an olive branch, and it certainly isn't anything near acceptance. But fine, whatever, go host the event. My greater problem is with this sentence in his statement: ""If we simply separate ourselves from those that we assume oppose us or our beliefs then we will never make strides in the right direction.""I urge my LGBT and ally brothers and sisters to use this line as a clarion call to do the complete opposite of what my designing pioneer of equality puts forth. First, we absolutely should and must separate ourselves from those who oppose us. We shouldn't be giving them our business or our time. Do not get gas at Exxon. Ever. Do not sit your family down at Cracker Barrel. Never purchase a toy from Hasbro. Avoid Kohl's and AutoZone and Men's Wearhouse and BJ's and True Value. Second, don't ""assume"" opposition. Actually find out. It's easy! All of the information above comes from the Corporate Equality Index published by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), where you can learn all about the practices of the top global companies. And if you don't see your shopping venue on the list, pick up the phone and actually ask the vendor some questions. Do they prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity? Do they offer benefits for same-sex partners? Is their health insurance trans-friendly? Do they boast efforts that engage with the external LGBT community? Once you have this info, make your purchasing decisions accordingly.And finally, it is not ""we"" the gays who need to ""make strides in the right direction"" toward these organizations. If we actually spend our money only on the organizations that support the LGBT community, then they, the bad ones, will make strides in the right directions toward us. They want our money. And they don't get it if we spend it elsewhere. This then makes them change. Plus, throwing our money at pro-LGBT companies encourages the companies with pro-gay practices to keep on the same track. These are not complex concepts. Let's please stop making it easier for these organizations and companies to continue their anti-gay practices. Instead, let's use our lavender color splash to inspire a complete purchasing makeover. (See what I did there, David Bromstad?)"

The company, with its network of more than 7,000 stores, is one of three dollar store chains (along with Dollar General and Dollar Tree) aggressively expanding across the country. These stores thrive on low-income shoppers -- but not no-income shoppers. Levine is bracing for shutdown pain, he said, as he doesn't expect his customers to recover any time soon. ""We expect that many of the headwinds faced by our customers will persist,"" he said. ""We have repositioned the company for the tough sales environment.""Low-income Americans have been caught up in Washington's funding impasse. Several states have scaled back or halted the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Woman, Infants and Children, which aids 9 million moms and babies across the country. Some states shuttered Head Start programs, affecting more than 7,000 children, until philanthropists stepped in with funding to cover the rest of the month. Arizona halted welfare checks for 3,200 families, until Gov. Jan Brewer (R) reversed the decision on Monday.Around 800,000 government employees have been furloughed during the shutdown, and that number doesn't include private-sector employees affected by the congressional standoff. While some workers have been called back -- including most of the nearly 400,000 Pentagon workers -- there's still no guarantee of back pay for some employees.But dollar store chains have also played a role in squeezing low-income consumers by forcing down wages, leading to some lengthy legal battles from employees who claimed mistreatment.The National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail trade group, sent a personalized letter to each member of the Senate and House of Representatives earlier this week, calling for an end to the shutdown and a measure to raise the debt ceiling.""There are warning signs that an extended shutdown will have serious repercussions for the U.S. economy,"" wrote Matthew Shay, the president and CEO of the NRF. He cautioned that the shutdown comes at the ""worst possible time"" for retailers -- in the run-up to the important holiday season. Holiday spending accounts for 20 percent of the industry's annual sales, according to the NRF.""Retailers already have more than 4 million cargo containers of merchandise on their way to store shelves for the holidays,"" wrote Shay. ""Even if Customs and other agencies can get that merchandise off the docks without a hitch, shutdown-fueled consumer worries over the economy could leave that merchandise sitting on shelves well past Christmas."""

With September jobs cuts up 19% from last year, it represented the fourth month in a row in which job cuts were higher than the same month last year. Despite the current trend, employers are on pace to cut roughly the same number of jobs that were cut last year.According to data compiled by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, 10 companies alone have announced close to 75,000 job cuts this year, combined. This represents nearly 20% of all the announced cuts in 2013.Click here to see which companies have cut the most jobsIn an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Challenger, Gray, & Christmas CEO John Challenger explained, “For every situation, there’s a different reason for a company to cut jobs.” In some cases, it is a matter of simple corporate restructuring. In other cases, companies facing difficult headwinds are forced to shed jobs. Based on data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the companies cutting the most jobs.The companies that are cutting the most jobs this year are, not surprisingly, in industries that are eliminating the most positions overall. The financial services sector is leading the way with 48,874 planned layoffs year to date. American Express, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo are all among the top 10 for announced job cuts.Retail was also in the top five industries, with J.C. Penney and Dish Network’s Blockbuster in the top 10. Aerospace and defense was also among the industries with the most planned layoffs. United Technologies and Boeing were among the companies eliminating the most jobs.Not all businesses have cut jobs due to poor demand for their products. Challenger also noted that companies announce job cuts when jobs are relocated to another part of the country, or even the world. Metlife moved a large number of jobs from the Northeast to a new base in North Carolina. Additionally, the company also scaled back its variable annuities business, while expanding its presence in emerging markets.Similarly, United Technologies has been restructuring its operations, both this year and last, in order to cut costs and integrate acquisitions, notably the $16 billion purchase of aircraft component maker Goodrich.Sometimes, technological change drives job cuts. “In these cases, the business model changes in response to new technology that affects the company or the industry, and a particular company adjusts,” Challenger explained. Cisco has had to contend with the emergence of cloud computing, as cheaper services have undercut the company’s traditionally profitable businesses. Similarly, the travel business of American Express has been impacted by the growth in travel websites.Some businesses have had to cut jobs as part of their efforts to stay afloat. ”A company just isn’t performing well via its competition, or maybe just revenue is down, and they’re just cutting back,” Challenger explained. J.C. Penney’s sales have declined precipitously in recent years, and it has struggled to keep enough cash on hand to run its business. As a result, the company has had to cut more than 15,000 jobs in 2013. Dish has had to slash jobs at Blockbuster as it continues to close unprofitable stores.Many of the companies announcing the most job cuts are also among the country’s largest employers. This means, in many cases, the layoffs represent only a small proportion of companies’ total workforces. IBM’s 9,4000 job cuts accounted for just over 2% of the company’s total headcount as of this year.Only a few of the companies cutting the most jobs have lost money. Only one of these companies, J.C. Penney, posted a net loss, while half increased their net income during their past full fiscal year. Also, shareholders in all but two of the 10 companies, J.C. Penney and IBM, have seen the value of their holdings rise so far in 2013.Challenger Gray & Christmas provided 24/7 Wall St. with all job cut announcements affecting at least 500 positions this year. 24/7 Wall St. combined all planned cuts by company to identify the companies that are cutting the most jobs this year. We only considered publicly traded, American companies, or divisions of publicly traded companies. Job cuts did not need to be entirely within the United States, however. Some cuts announced in 2013 may not be completed this year. Full-time employee totals were from Yahoo! Finance.These are the 10 companies cutting the most jobs, according to 24/7 Wall St."

The singer said he supports protestations made by musicians like Thom Yorke, who removed Atoms for Peace's music from the service and last week encouraged those in the industry to ""fight the Spotify thing.""Byrne's thesis is best summed up here: ""The inevitable result would seem to be that the internet will suck the creative content out of the whole world until nothing is left. ... For a band of four people that makes a 15% royalty from Spotify streams, it would take 236,549,020 streams for each person to earn a minimum wage of $15,080 (£9,435) a year. For perspective, Daft Punk's song of the summer, 'Get Lucky,' reached 104,760,000 Spotify streams by the end of August: the two Daft Punk guys stand to make somewhere around $13,000 each. Not bad, but remember this is just one song from a lengthy recording that took a lot of time and money to develop. That won't pay their bills if it's their principal source of income. And what happens to the bands who don't have massive international summer hits?""The Talking Heads singer and ""How Music Works"" author goes on to question the discoverability of new artists via Spotify -- something some acts champion -- as well as whether streaming services are simply profitable versions of illegal entities ""such as Napster and Pirate Bay.""""I don't have an answer,"" Byrne concludes. ""I wish I could propose something besides what we've heard before: 'Make money on live shows.' Or, 'Get corporate support and sell your music to advertisers.' What's at stake is not so much the survival of artists like me, but that of emerging artists and those who have only a few records under their belts.""Read Byrne's incisive essay over on The Guardian."

But the ""Wrecking Ball"" superstar insists that her actions have all been part of a grand scheme -- one that's been thoughtfully orchestrated on her own.In an interview with Hunger TV, Cyrus revealed that she's very much running her own ship and is not the industry puppet that some make her out to be.  ""With magazines, with movies, it’s always weird when things are targeted for young people yet they’re driven by people that are like 40 years too old. It can’t be like this 70-year-old Jewish man that doesn’t leave his desk all day, telling me what the clubs want to hear,"" Cyrus said. ""I’m going out, I know what they want to hear. I know when you’re in a club, what makes everyone go crazy and when the time is where everyone’s like, 'All right, I’m going go get a drink.' I know when people walk off the dance floor and I know what’s driving it, so I’ve got to be the one doing it because they’re just not in on what 20-year-olds are doing.""Chatting about the creation of her outlandish -- and wildly popular -- music video for ""We Can't Stop,"" Cyrus said that she was the person who had to push the idea forward, convincing the naysayers in her management to come on board.""At first on paper that video sounded insane. No one understood it, and I’m just like, 'Let me film it, and then if it doesn’t work out, you never have to trust me again. But if it works out, you have to let me drive this ship. You know I’m on to something. And then they call me and they’re like, 'Yo, you’re onto something!'""Read Hunger TV's full interview with Miley Cyrus here.Hunger TV's Holly Fraser, having conducted the interview with Cyrus, praised the young woman's business skills. ""Miley is incredibly savvy,"" Fraser wrote. ""It’s her that comes up with her public image and performances, as she knows it will shock people, so in turn will keep them talking, which will then equate to album sales,"" Fraser continued. ""A clever formula, and one that’s obviously working.""Fraser isn't the only person who has lauded Cyrus' business savviness this week. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Billy Ray Cyrus said his daughter is a ""very smart young lady.""“She wanted to shake things up a little bit, and mission accomplished,” he said of Cyrus' raunchy MTV Video Music Awards performance with Robin Thicke. “She [did] a great deal of preparation and financial investment. All those bears and things she was going out of pocket for to make that stage great. She said she wanted people to be talking.”"
