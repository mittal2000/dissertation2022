Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) proves you don't have to be in the Capitol to cause problems in the Senate. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d890471e0000950070f3cb.jpeg?cache=Z7XevAcOPe&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Even hundreds of miles away from Washington, GOP presidential candidate and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is still causing trouble for the Obama administration. Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) on Thursday tried for the second time to get a Senate vote on the Mexico ambassador nominee, Roberta Jacobson. And for the second time, Rubio helped block that vote, even though he is in Detroit preparing for a Republican debate. After Udall asked for ""unanimous consent"" to move forward, Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho) rose to object on behalf of himself and Rubio. ""What is holding up her nomination? It isn't her qualifications, that isn't the problem,"" Udall said on the Senate floor afterward. ""A big part of the problem is presidential politics, and the policy differences with the administration over her work with Cuba."" Rubio has accused Jacobson of failing to prioritize the issue of human rights on the island since the Obama administration re-established diplomatic relations with the Castro government for the first time in more than half a century last year. As the son of Cuban migrants and closely aligned with the exile community of South Florida, Rubio has strongly protested the loosening of travel and trade restrictions against the Communist government.It's not the first time Rubio has held up a vote on the nomination from afar. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) objected to a vote on Rubio's behalf in February, when the candidate was out of Washington campaigning.The failure to move forward with Jacobson's nomination is an example of the gridlock that has left spots open for months and even years due to the Senate's refusal to work with President Barack Obama -- on display even more now, as Republicans object to even meeting with a potential nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia's death. ""This line gets longer and longer of perfectly qualified nominees denied a vote, denied an opportunity to be heard,"" Udall said on the Senate floor. He said he would continue to try to get a vote on Jacobson's nomination. Mexico, with whom the United States shares a 2,000-mile border and more than $500 billion in annual trade, has been without an ambassador since July. This makes it much harder for the top levels of the U.S. government to communicate in real time with their counterparts in the Mexican government on a slew of urgent issues ranging from immigration, to fighting organized crime, to economic development.President Barack Obama nominated Jacobson last June, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to move forward with the process in November. The previous nominee, Maria Echaveste, withdrew her name from consideration in January 2015 after going months without even a hearing on her nomination.The nomination has caused fissures in both parties. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who endorsed Rubio for president, supports Jacobson, and told reporters he has ""encouraged him to let it go"" -- even participating in a press conference Thursday morning calling for a vote with Udall and Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). There are some divides within the Democratic caucus as well, although it is more unified in support. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who is of Cuban descent, voted against Jacobson at the Nov. 10 committee meeting, taking issue with her characterization of the level of threat posed by Venezuela and saying she had not done enough to confront authoritarianism in Latin America. ""To say that it was misleading would be polite,"" Menendez told reporters last week, referring to her testimony on Venezuela. He said it had nothing to do with her work on Cuba. Menendez said he would vote against her again, but did not put a hold on her nomination.Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said the senator maintains his opposition ""on the basis of her failure to be transparent during the confirmation process, inability to provide straightforward answers, and poor track record on a wide range of issues as the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs."" ""It is his belief that Ms. Jacobson is unprepared for this important role and lacks the trustworthiness we need in an ambassador to one of our most important partners,"" Burgos said.Jacobson continues to serve in the assistant secretary role, overseeing the implementation of U.S. policy across the Americas. Many policymakers who focus on Latin America, however, question Rubio’s hold-up of a highly regarded nominee who has spent three decades building a career in diplomacy focused almost entirely on Latin America, serving both Democratic and Republican administrations. Critics of the opposition to Jacobson’s nomination also note that few people in Mexico follow the partisan battles in the U.S. Congress closely enough to understand why the top spot at the embassy in Mexico City has been left unfilled. Instead, it comes across as simple neglect. “For most Mexicans, a lack of an ambassador is a sign of the U.S. government not caring about the relationship,” former Mexican ambassador to the U.S. Arturo Sarukhán told The Huffington Post. “It sends the message that the U.S. has no skin in the game.” That could be very damaging to U.S.-Mexico relations, including for business, U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce president and CEO Javier Palomarez said at the press conference with senators Thursday.""By delaying this vote, the Senate is sending a clear message to Mexico,"" he said. ""We're letting them know that we don't value our relationship. ... Nothing could be further than the truth."" "

Family and close friends of the centenarian have started a YouCaring fundraising page to help secure a living situation that's more accessible for the 106-year-old. McLaurin's friend and former neighbor Deborah Menkart explained to The Huffington Post that the centenarian, who is retired, currently has to walk up a difficult flight of stairs to get to her apartment.""While she's very nimble and spry now, the thought is to ensure she has a secure living situation for the years ahead,"" Menkart said. ""She's recognizing that ... she might not always be able to get up to her apartment and that would be a problem."" The crowdfunding campaign, which was started earlier this week, had already generated more than $12,000 of the $50,000 goal as of Thursday afternoon. The funds from the campaign would hopefully allow McLaurin to move to an apartment near her church -- preferably one that's on the first floor of a building or in a building with an elevator. The money would also help the 106-year-old, who lives primarily off of food stamps and a delivery of groceries a week, purchase a cell phone as well as cover other basic expenses. ""She's determined that she wants to live independently and close to her church,"" Menkart said. ""So we need to make sure that there are the funds to secure that for her.""Menkart mentioned that she, along with many others, wanted to give back to the 106-year-old because McLaurin has done so much for her community. While the centenarian is retired, she still volunteers as a foster grandmother for about 40 hours a week in an early childhood classroom. ""She volunteers and she's always looking out for people. Given all that she's done for everyone else ... and that was why we wanted to make this possible for her,"" she said. To learn more about the fundraiser, visit the crowdfunding campaign's page here.

3,ENTERTAINMENT,The Little Girl From The Oscars Was In The Dark About Chris Rock's Lazy Asian Joke,Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oscars-chris-rock-asian-joke-kid_us_56d8a2c7e4b0ffe6f8e89a00,"""The angrier people are and more people talk about it, the better it will be moving forward.""",2016-03-03,"Children represent accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers on stage at the 88th Oscars on February 28, 2016 in Hollywood, California. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d8a9601e0000950070f3f4.jpeg?cache=PzkK1T9CwX&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the aftermath of the Academy Awards, a few things have been made clear: Tina Fey didn't love them, the Girl Scout cookie gambit was for real and Chris Rock wasn't as funny as everyone thought he was. The comedian drew fire for the multiple jokes made at the expense of the Asian-American community during Sunday's ceremony, particularly the bit where he brought out three children on stage as ""Oscars accountants."" It's funny, because they're Asian. Get it? He then followed the gag with this charming footnote: “If anybody’s upset about that joke, just tweet about it on your phone that was also made by these kids.”Making matters that much worse, it has recently come to light that the children and their parents were unaware of the content of the joke before the contracts were signed. In an interview with Public Radio International, Estie Kung, one of the kids involved, and her mother, Laura, reveal they were completely caught off guard when they heard the racist joke for the first time. In this case, it wasn't until the rehearsals, after Estie got her tux fitted and was already looking forward to the opportunity to be on the Oscars, that her parents heard the entirety of the joke for the first time. But they had already signed the contract and had to confront the very likely possibility that their daughter would be part of a racist joke that would cause an uproar. After talking to Estie, they ultimately decided to take the optimistic point of view, believing that an inappropriate Asian joke that might provoke a difficult public conversation may be preferable if the status-quo alternative was to have no Asian presence at all. So, they braced themselves.The Kungs were under the impression that the joke would be similar to Rock's previous poking fun at the annual accounting segment, when he brought two tall black men out to present in 2005. ""I did wonder, 'Why all Asians?'"" Laura Kung said. ""But I assumed there was a bigger picture, a more complex joke given all the emphasis placed on diversity at the Oscars this year.""After the ceremony, however, it became clear that the ""bigger picture"" was stereotyping the Asian community, while making light of the very real problem of child labor. ""This was not OK and should never have happened,"" Kung added. ""But the angrier people are and more people talk about it, the better it will be moving forward. Estie hopes to keep acting and we all hope for a time when she can be on that stage to honor her achievement.""We have no doubt that Estie will make it back to the Oscars, especially considering her hilarious guest spot on ""The Late Late Show with James Corden.""H/T Vulture"

Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) speaks during the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) 2016 at National Harbor in Oxon Hill, Maryland, outside Washington, March 3, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d89444150000ad000b12c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- Amid fiery speeches and emotional pleas about “the future of conservatism” at a major conservative conference Thursday, there was no mention of the man who might be conservatism’s biggest existential threat: Donald Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner.On the first day of the Conservative Political Action Conference speakers showed no inclination to address the matter, despite growing panic and opposition toward Trump’s firepower in the GOP presidential race.Even rising star Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), one of the party’s most vocal Trump critics, did not refer to the real estate mogul in his speech on conservatism. Over the past few weeks, Sasse has sounded the alarm about Trump’s candidacy, revealing that he will not vote for him and may leave the party if Trump becomes the nominee.On Thursday, Sasse instead delivered a more general statement about the Constitution and freedom of liberty, skewering President Barack Obama and other Democrats for being “post-constitutional” and lamenting the consequences of the Obama presidency for conservatives. “It’s been a bad seven years for the Republican party. It’s been a bad seven years for conservatism. It’s been a bad seven years for those of us who believe in the American idea,” he said.Sasse also told attendees to look beyond Washington to “make America great again.”“The meaning of America is not in Washington, D.C. The meaning of America is in all the little platoons that you come from,” he said.Other conservatives tried to provide prescriptions for the future. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum (R), who has twice sought the GOP presidential nomination, implored conservatives to embrace populist ideals as a means of building a more inclusive movement.“We’re not feeling the love because we haven’t been giving much,” he said.Similarly, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who kicked off the afternoon session and garnered a rousing standing ovation, spoke about his anti-poverty initiatives. Just hours earlier, he addressed Trump’s candidacy, laughing off the businessman’s threat that Ryan would “pay a big price” if the two did not get along. Ryan, however, issued his own threat toward Trump.“If I see episodes where conservatism is being disfigured, if I see ideas and comments that mislead the people as to who we are as Republicans, I’m going to speak out on those,” he said at a Capitol Hill press conference.It’s a strange balancing act for CPAC -- one of the biggest annual gatherings of conservatives -- particularly in presidential election years. Trump himself will appear at CPAC in a prime speaking spot on Saturday. The real estate mogul has donated money to the organization which hosts the conference, the American Conservative Union, and has spoken at CPAC several times before, often to boos from the crowd.But this time, it’s different, as Trump continues to barrel toward the GOP presidential nomination while the worried party establishment mulls a brokered convention and other measures to stop him.Some conservatives hoping to halt Trump’s progress are riled up about Saturday’s speech, posting a petition to force organizers to rescind the invitation, though all of the remaining GOP presidential candidates will speak here in the next two days.Any mention of presidential politics on Thursday mainly targeted the other side. National Rifle Association vice president Wayne LaPierre attacked “the Obamas and the Clintons” for never ""getting the basic truth.""LaPierre seemed to reference Trump’s appeal when he told attendees that “this election year proves the rage of the American people to be real and to be powerful.”“Candidates, strategists and pundits are learning this year that telling it like it is brings success. Straight talk brings rewards,” he said.But that turned out to be a segue into his usual defense of the Second Amendment and the NRA as “a guiding light for American gun owners,” with LaPierre criticizing Democrats for trying to limit gun rights and spreading “deceit.” He also aired old video clips of his own television appearances defending gun rights, which were met with raucous applause.It was another speech that seemed like business as usual, in a presidential election year that has been anything but usual.Editor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Farmer Labor Party’s caucus in Minnesota Tuesday. The Sanders campaign had targeted Minnesota as one of the Super Tuesday states he needed to win to keep his path to the nomination alive. His team poured resources into Minnesota, opening more field offices than Clinton and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars more on television and radio advertisements. He had predicted on Sunday that it would be one of the states where he’d be celebrating. On Saturday, Sanders was on his way to Rochester, Minnesota, when South Carolina’s primary result was called for Clinton: She beat him there by nearly 50 points, in large part because she dominated among African-American voters, who make up more than 60 percent of the primary voters in that state. Minnesota had long been considered more favorable terrain for Sanders because the Democratic electorate there is significantly more white. The senator has struggled to pick up support among racial minorities, but won New Hampshire and nearly tied Clinton in Iowa in early February because of his strength among white and liberal voters. Sanders had repeatedly visited Minnesota before Tuesday, appearing with Rep. Keith Ellison, the Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair who endorsed him last October. He held three events in the state Friday -- in Duluth, Saint Paul and Hibbing -- and returned on Monday for a rally in Minneapolis. Clinton, in contrast, did not visit the state in the days before the caucuses, but her daughter, Chelsea, appeared at multiple events on her behalf alongside Mark Dayton, the state’s governor, and Rep. Tim Walz. (Clinton was also endorsed by the rest of the state’s DFL establishment, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken and Lt. Gov. Tina Smith.)Sanders' campaign also won Colorado's caucus and Oklahoma and Vermont's primaries Tuesday, but suffered a narrow loss to Clinton in Massachusetts, where he had hoped to win. Clinton beat him by wide margins in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Clinton’s campaign had pointed out that the states where Sanders hoped to prevail sent fewer delegates to the party’s convention this summer than the southern states they believed she would win.Both candidates had emphasized their progressive credentials while appealing to Minnesota’s caucus-goers. Clinton wrote an op-ed published in the Minnesota Star-Tribune on her vision for boosting manufacturing jobs and enforcing trade rules and ran an ad in the state promising to crack down on corporate inversions, where companies buy other companies outside the U.S. to avoid paying domestic taxes. Sanders highlighted his opposition to fracking, the Keystone XL pipeline and trade agreements like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.Sanders’ political worldview is uniquely suited to Minnesota, which has a history of sending progressives like the late Sen. Paul Wellstone to Congress. Sanders gave a tribute to Wellstone on the Senate floor in 2007, the five-year anniversary of his death, noting that the former senator “understood the way you win elections is by rallying ordinary people at the grassroots level.” "

Bernie Sanders in one of Super Tuesday's most competitive matchups.Polls taken before the vote had shown the former secretary of state only narrowly ahead, and both campaigns staged last-minute rallies in the state on Monday.With its liberal, largely white electorate, Massachusetts was one of Sanders' best opportunities to pick up delegates on Super Tuesday.""Massachusetts should be among the best states for Sanders, apart from his home state of Vermont, where polls show him winning by a huge margin,"" pollsters Steve Koczela and Rich Parr wrote last week. ""In terms of demographics and ideology, Massachusetts resembles Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where Sanders has done best so far. So, if Massachusetts is an uphill battle for Bernie and his supporters, the other states voting next Tuesday are likely to be sheer cliffs.""While Clinton outspent Sanders overall on Super Tuesday advertising, the Vermont senator doubled down on Massachusetts, spending $1.35 million to her $547,000, according to Politico.But the state also has a history as a Clinton stronghold. It's where she attended college, and where, in 2008, she won the primary by more than 15 points over Barack Obama. She was backed overwhelmingly by the state's political establishment, winning the endorsement of all its congressional representatives except for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D), who has so far remained neutral.Of the 116 Democratic delegates up for grabs in Massachusetts, just 59 will be awarded in proportion to the candidates' primary performance across the state's nine congressional districts. The remainder include 20 at-large delegates and 12 party leaders and elected officials -- who will all be chosen in May -- and 25 so-called superdelegates."

Bernie Sanders won the Democratic caucus in Colorado on Tuesday, defeating Hillary Clinton and giving his flagging presidential campaign a much-needed boost.Democrats turned up at schools, community centers and public libraries across the state to vote in person. Voters who attend caucuses in the state tend to be more enthusiastic and more progressive than state Democrats overall -- two characteristics that have benefited Sanders in previous contests.The state has added approximately 30,000 registered Democrats in recent months, some of whom joined the party specifically so they could caucus for Sanders. Caucuses in Colorado are open only to registered party members.However, with more than 1 million independent voters across the state excluded from the Super Tuesday caucuses, the question of who will win Colorado in November is still very much up in the air. Both Clinton and Sanders hosted events in the state ahead of Tuesday's caucus. At Colorado State University on Sunday, Sanders addressed a crowd of more than 6,000 people, including many students. Young people have proved to be especially receptive to Sanders' message of economic equality and making education affordable. Clinton didn't have nearly as much riding on the Super Tuesday outcome in Colorado, but the former secretary of state in recent weeks has dispatched her most effective campaign surrogates, including former President Bill Clinton and actress America Ferrera, to the state.

14,POLITICS,Obama And Biden Endorse Centrist Dem For Marco Rubio's Florida Senate Seat,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-biden-patrick-murphy-florida_us_56d6ec2ce4b03260bf78a77d,"It's a snub for his controversial rival, Bernie Sanders supporter Alan Grayson.",2016-03-02,"Patrick Murphy at his Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, office in 2012.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d6f7fd150000ad000b1116.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have endorsed Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.) to be the Democratic candidate for the Senate in one of the party's most competitive battles this cycle, according to Murphy's campaign.The campaign sent a statement to The Huffington Post and other outlets on Wednesday morning that cited Obama's praise for Murphy's work on a range of issues and a statement from Biden calling him a champion for the middle class.""The President, the Vice President and I share the same values and commitment -- strengthening Social Security and Medicare for our seniors, protecting a woman's right to choose, and growing America’s middle class,"" Murphy said, per the statement. ""Over the past seven years, President Obama and Vice President Biden have been champions for Democrats and hardworking families across our country, and I am humbled and proud to receive their endorsement and campaign shoulder-to-shoulder with them for what we believe in.""The move snubs Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.), Murphy's more liberal rival for the Democratic nomination in Florida's Senate race. Coming the day after presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton largely dominated Super Tuesday primary contests against her rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), it also appeared to be a sign of the party's direction as the general election nears: coalescing behind candidates who are keen to talk about Obama's legacy rather than the revolution Sanders envisions and are more likely to appeal to voters beyond the Democratic base.Grayson endorsed Sanders two days ago, after initially disappointing some of his more progressive supporters by joining a pro-Clinton leadership council in Florida last November. The congressman said he made his choice to back Sanders based on a poll run on his campaign website in which the Vermont senator received more than 86 percent of the vote. After winning seven states on Super Tuesday and leading Sanders by about 14 points in a compilation of polls prepared by HuffPost Pollster on Wednesday, Clinton appears to be turning her focus to the general election.Murphy endorsed the Democratic front-runner even before she announced her candidacy, his campaign told HuffPost.At 32, Murphy has established strong ties with organized labor and worked on foreign policy as a member of the House intelligence committee. In August, he became one of the first lawmakers from Florida to endorse Obama's top foreign policy priority: a nuclear deal between six world powers and Iran. He entered Congress in 2012 after a high-profile victory over former Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.), a tea party darling.Grayson, meanwhile, has established himself as a firebrand multimillionaire willing to bash Republicans and take on the establishment in Washington -- including the Obama administration. He first leaped to prominence by targeting contractors he said exploited U.S. taxpayers for work in Iraq after the American-led invasion of that country in 2003. But now, he faces his own accusations of wrongdoing. The House Committee on Ethics is investigating whether Grayson has misused his congressional perch for the sake of his business, a hedge fund previously run out of the Cayman Islands. A New York Times investigation released last month used emails and marketing documents to show that the congressman promoted the work he did on behalf of his constituents -- particularly, his trips abroad -- to win investors for his fund.Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the Democrats' leader in the Senate, has called for Grayson to suspend his campaign against Murphy because he believes the congressman's alleged missteps show that he is unfit to be in Congress. (Murphy feels that way, too.)Meanwhile, Grayson has denounced Murphy for his ties to the mainstream Democratic party and his former membership in the Republican party. He called his opponent a ""lickspittle pillock"" who ""has enlisted the help of lame party hacks like Sen. Harry Reid (BFF-Lobbyists) in a vicious smear campaign.""Biden will campaign with Murphy later this month, the congressman's campaign stated.The Florida Democratic primary will be held on Aug. 30. Once the Republican and Democratic parties select their congressional nominees, those candidates will compete for the Senate seat that current Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is set to vacate in January 2017."

Xavier Beccera of California -- called out what they saw as duplicity behind the selection of the speaker's squad. ""You cannot put forward a task force on poverty and have people who are serving on that task force who have consistently voted against every opportunity to provide people with the services that they need to keep them out of poverty,"" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), one of Congress' most ardent advocates for the poor. ""It is incongruous. It is a sham.""Last week, Ryan announced members of the new GOP task force on poverty, an issue he’s been vocal about on the Hill since 2013. But Democrats were quick to denounce the group, particularly the members whom GOP leadership selected to serve on it.DeLauro said Democrats wouldn't allow ""partisan posturing"" to hold a shadow over those in need. She pointed to the voting records of task force members -- Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas), Budget Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.), Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline (R-Minn.), Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) -- and said they had a history of voting to cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Head Start.Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said everyone under the Capitol dome should already be ashamed of the nation's struggle with poverty, but he characterized the speaker's task force as a new low, warning that no Democrat will be ""silent in the face of Republican attempts to bring to a halt the war on poverty.""McGovern insisted that Ryan's task force was actually advocating a war on the poor.""It is unconscionable that they would do that,"" McGovern said referring to the votes that would have slashed funding to impoverished Americans. ""But those are the people that are making up this task force to supposedly try to deal with poverty in this country. That's why we say it's a sham. That's why we're skeptical.""It doesn't help the GOP cause that most of the people on its poverty task force are rich white guys. Two are millionaires: Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) is worth $7.2 million and Rep. Michael Conaway (R-Texas) is worth $5 million, according to Roll Call's rankings of the richest members of Congress. Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) is worth $590,000, and Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) is worth $100,000. The final member, Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.), sadly, is $410,000 in debt.In total, their average worth is $2.5 million.With 46 million Americans currently living below the federal poverty line, Democrats here have called for more bipartisan action and support. The hope, Hoyer said recently, is to strengthen anti-poverty programs already enacted and denounce “the failed austerity policies of past Republican Congresses.”Becerra said some members of the Democratic Caucus have been working against poverty for a long time, whereas congressional Republicans have been ""all talk no action"" and ""asleep at the wheel"" not just on poverty, but on many of America's issues.Rep. Alma Adams (D-N.C.) challenged House Republicans to work with Democrats on promises about raising the minimum wage, strengthening education and housing programs and ensuring the impoverished get quality food. Pelosi, like her Democratic colleagues, welcomed help from the other side of the aisle but voiced her skepticism. ""We need to confront poverty in America with fresh eyes and new thinking,"" she said Wednesday. ""If Republicans want to join Democrats in a meaningful bipartisan conversation on poverty, we welcome them. But Republicans’ tired, trickle-down agenda is no solution for struggling Americans.""As they stood in the early March chill, Hoyer noted that Democrats have had their own poverty task force since 2013, and facetiously welcomed Ryan to the fray. ""We are here in the cold, but we are here to talk about those people who are being left out in the cold who are victims to our negligence and inaction,"" Hoyer said. ""Speaker Ryan has spoken at much greater length than many Republicans about the importance of combating poverty. I appreciate his words. Those in poverty would appreciate his actions.""Jen Bendery contributed reporting."

Rob Portman (R-Ohio) testifies during a January Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on attacking America’s epidemic of heroin and prescription drug abuse. Republicans voted Wednesday against emergency funding to combat the widespread issue.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked $600 million in emergency funding intended to improve the monitoring of prescription drugs and help law enforcement combat heroin abuse.In a 48-47 procedural vote, Republicans prevented the amendment from being attached to a larger bill aimed at fighting the heroin and opioid epidemic sweeping the U.S. The legislation, called the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, would establish an interagency task force to create best practices for prescribing opioids, and shift federal officials toward prevention-driven drug policy and away from punishment.The emergency funding provision would have allocated $230 million to law enforcement initiatives, including treatment alternatives to incarceration. Another $10 million would have gone to state and local law enforcement units that oversee communities with high levels of drug use.Drug reform groups were not pleased with the hundreds of millions of dollars in the measure that would have gone toward enforcement. ""CARA is clearly a step in the right direction, while the Democratic alternative looks like something out of the 1980s,"" said Bill Piper, a top official with the reformist group Drug Policy Alliance, which is typically more sympathetic to Democratic approaches.The amendment, authored by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), also set aside $300 million for state programs focused on prevention, treatment and recovery, and for improving treatment for pregnant and postpartum women dealing with heroin or opioid addiction. The remaining funds would have helped the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in its drug monitoring programs, and increased medication-assisted treatment in high-risk communities.While the underlying bill is bipartisan and the product of three years of work between senators in both parties, Shaheen’s measure was seen as the one “controversial” amendment.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) called it “duplicative.”Republicans argued that millions of dollars were already appropriated to tackle heroin and opioid addiction in the omnibus spending bill passed in December. But Democrats wanted emergency funds to help communities grappling with the problem.Republican Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio), Mark Kirk (Ill.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Susan Collins (Maine) and Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) voted with Democrats in favor of the measure.“The omnibus provided a modest boost to key federal programs, but it did not begin to address the magnitude of the opioid crisis,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said in a statement. “What the omnibus didn’t provide was a way to direct funding to first responders and treatment providers quickly. My amendment fast-tracks urgently needed resources specifically to those on the front lines battling this pandemic.”"

20,POLITICS,Donald Trump: The GOP's Crazy Uncle Turned Existential Threat,Sam Stein and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-super-tuesday_us_56d66fa0e4b0871f60ed3825,"A Republican operative didn't mince words: ""If anyone tells you they're not worried about the long-term viability of the party, they're lying.""",2016-03-02,"This guy is likely going to be the GOP nominee, and that is causing serious problems within the Republican Party.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During fall 2011, Mitt Romney decided to take time off the campaign trail to pay a visit to midtown Manhattan. Carefully evading the press, he ducked into a classy high-rise on Fifth Avenue and ascended to the floor where one Donald J. Trump waited. Trump was, at the time, a vocal critic of various presidential candidates and the primary peddler of the birther conspiracies swirling around President Barack Obama. Romney wasn't the only Republican in the field who felt the need to cozy up to the businessman. Still, the visit was odd, even uncomfortable. If anyone didn't need to kiss up to Trump, surely it was the patrician Republican with the high-minded sensibilities.But Romney and his aides had made a calculation: They didn't need Trump's support so much as they needed to avoid his animus.""What Mitt Romney was seeking was to have Donald Trump not crap all over our campaign for the entire year,"" Katie Packer, Romney's deputy campaign manager, said back in December. ""He was either on your team and to some degree would be supportive… [or] he would be at your throat all the time. And so the calculation was made that it is better to have him on the team and whatever baggage that brings with us.""Fast forward four years and Trump's baggage remains a big problem. On Super Tuesday he won at least seven states, only reaffirming the likelihood that he will end up the Republican presidential nominee. And now the very people who decided it would be best to try and curry favor with him are left frantically trying to bring him down.Minutes before results started coming in on Tuesday, The New York Times reported that an anti-Trump super PAC run by Packer was getting an infusion of donations, some of it coming from major contributors to Romney's presidential campaign. It would be unfair to suggest that Romney’s voyage to Trump Tower that fall directly led to Trump’s success in the 2016 race. But it is abundantly clear that many in the Republican Party regret not having taken a stand against Trump far sooner.The question facing these operatives, pundits and lawmakers now is not just how to wage a war against Trump before the July convention -- to keep him from collecting the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the nomination outright -- but whether the party can actually survive his candidacy at all. ""If anyone tells you they're not worried about the long-term viability and electability of the party when you look at Trump, they're lying,"" said Rory Cooper, a Republican operative who is vehemently opposed to Trump. ""Some voters have shown a willingness to overlook the more extreme positions that Trump takes or condones to support his underlying strength and security rhetoric.""Conversations with multiple key Republicans over the past week revealed a stark sense of discomfort and fear. Months of Trump making outrageous, outlandish and decidedly racist remarks had not put a dent in his support. And the usual electoral trends -- in which the subversive, crazy elements are gradually suppressed with money, endorsements, organizational power and so on -- were not taking shape.Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican up for re-election in Georgia, told reporters in the Capitol on Tuesday that he would not endorse anyone this primary season like he had in the past. Why not? ""I'm on the ballot. I've got a primary,"" he said. Asked how he felt about his chances, he said, ""I feel good. Which is why I'm going in here, because if I don't say something stupid in answer to a question, then I might win."" He then ducked into a private lunch with other Republican senators. Some Republicans, meanwhile, expressed cautious optimism that when the final nominee was chosen, the party's differing factions could be brought peacefully back together. ""If Trump becomes the nominee, he becomes the titular head of the GOP. He has to, at that point, recognize he can't win a race without the entire party,"" said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee. And if Trump were to somehow lose the nomination, Steele said, the nominee ""will have to figure out how to work with Trump. If their attitude is let's dismiss him outright, they do it at their peril. He is going to play an important role as much as these folks don't want it and don't like it."" Donald Trump himself promised as much. ""I'm a unifier,"" he offered in his victory press conference Tuesday night.But there was also notable chatter that perhaps the GOP would be better off in the long run if it simply decided to write off the extreme elements of the Trump base, rather than try and cater to their demands -- to do, essentially, what Romney did not.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who lost his own bid in the GOP primary, said that Trump's base is made up of xenophobes. ""I think 70 percent of his support comes from people who want to deport 'em all and wanna ban all Muslims,” he said. “That xenophobia's old, there's really nothing new going on. There have been other times in American history where people were scapegoating groups, particularly when times were tough.” Several operatives compared the situation to what the party faced in the Mississippi Senate primary in 2014, when operatives swooped in to undermine the Tea Party favorite, Chris McDaniel, and send Sen. Thad Cochran back for a sixth term. ""That was about as nasty as you can get in politics,"" Brad Dayspring, then the communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told The Huffington Post in November of that year. ""I was accused of murder. Directly accused of murder.""But the party doesn't have the capacity or moxie to do what it did in Mississippi on a national level. It certainly doesn't have the time. And so Republicans are left wondering just how to make their way out of this mess, not just in this cycle but for the elections to come. ""I think that the party can certainly recover from this, but the immediate task is trying to make sure we nominate somebody who shares our principles and does the job in the White House that we can trust,"" said Henry Barbour, a top Republican operative who supports Marco Rubio and is vocally opposed to Trump.""We are deciding who is going to be our nominee to be the leader of the free world,” he said. “There is a lot at stake. Donald Trump is not fit to serve in the same office as George Washington and Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.""Barbour paused for a second. ""It is a scary proposition.""Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
