She also has an injury to the ligament on the inside of the same knee, and a meniscus injury.""She will most likely have to have an operation on the knee, but we cannot say anything more about it yet.""American Jacqueline Hernandez, who went out sixth, was the second faller, hitting the slope with a thud as she tried to land backwards and appearing to lose consciousness as she smashed her head into the snow.Again there was a delay as she received medical treatment but she had also recovered consciousness before she was taken away on the stretcher.The U.S. team later said Hernandez had been treated in the medical tent where they ascertained she had suffered a concussion. She was withdrawn from the competition.Italy's Michela Moioli later ruptured a cruciate ligament in her knee after a fall in the final and will return home to undergo surgery, the Italian Olympic Committee said on their website.FEDERATIONS HAPPYThe International Olympic Committee said the courses had been approved by the federations, who are responsible for their respective fields of play.""I know they are very happy with it,"" IOC spokesman Mark Adams told reporters.He said he had just been informed of the two incidents in the snowboarding competition but said there was ""no huge cause for concern,"" and they were unrelated to the Komissarova accident.""The accident was in an individual practice. She (Komissarova) was actually in training by herself when the accident happened. So it is not actually the format or the course that is necessarily the problem.""They (courses) did not appear to have any difference from Vancouver (2010 Olympics). The athletes are happy with the course,"" he said.Despite the two heavy falls on Sunday morning, American boarder Faye Gulini echoed Adams's view that there was nothing wrong with the course.""This is a great course, but it is intimidating,"" she said after finishing fourth in the final.""We don't usually have courses that have jumps this big and it's so much fun. But some girls don't have this capability of hitting these huge jumps.""This course is safe. It has big features which are intimidating looking, but it's built right. So if you give this course all the speed you can it's gonna work. If you do everything right you will be on your feet.""For a lot of people, it was a mental thing.""

(Photo by Jeff Gross/Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb747b1240000500056fb51.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Joel Corry, National Football PostA player must not react emotionally if his team asks him to take a pay cut. Before deciding whether to entertain a pay cut, a player must evaluate whether he believes he can sign a new deal that is comparable to his current contract on the open market. If this type of analysis isn’t done, a poor decision can be made. There are also instances where a player is willing to accept a pay cut because he knows that both his salary and salary cap number are too much, but the team releases him instead of providing that option. Five players who could be asked to take a pay cut this off-season in order to remain with their current clubs are highlighted below.Champ Bailey (CB)-Denver BroncosBailey isn’t ready to call it quits. He wants to play a 16th NFL season. The 35-year-old is entering the last year of a four-year, $43 million contract (worth a maximum of $46.75 million through base salary escalators) after a season in which he was limited to five regular season games because of a left foot sprain that occurred in a pre-season game against the Seattle Seahawks. In addition, 2013 marked the first time in Bailey’s storied career that the cornerback failed to record an interception. Bailey is slated to make $10 million next season and have a $10 million salary cap number. $1 million of Bailey’s salary is a roster bonus payable on the fifth day of the 2014 league year (March 15). His cap number (and total salary) will increase to $10.5 million with satisfactory participation in Denver’s off-season workout program.Bailey’s 2014 salary doesn’t reflect the market for older defensive backs. Ronde Barber’s last two contracts with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, both one-year deals in 2011 and 2012 when he was 36 and 37-years-old, were worth $3 million (with an additional $1 million for making the Pro Bowl). Charles Woodson signed a one-year, $1.8 million deal (plus an additional $2.5 million in incentives) with the Oakland Raiders in 2013 as a 36-year-old. Woodson earned $1.5 million of his incentive package to bring his total compensation to $3.3 million. The Broncos will gain $10 million of cap space if they part ways with Bailey.DeMarcus Ware (DE)-Dallas CowboysWare’s $16,003,750 cap number is a result of restructuring his six-year, $78 million deal in three consecutive off-seasons. His figure needs to be addressed because Dallas currently has an NFL-high $152.2 million in 2014 cap obligations. Ware has indicated that he’s willing to restructure his contract once again, but a pay cut is a different story. The seven-time Pro Bowler was limited to a career-low six sacks in 2013 while dealing with quadriceps, elbow and back injuries. Reducing the 31-year-old’s $12.75 million salary by $4 million seems reasonable considering 32-year-old Robert Mathis, who led the NFL with 19.5 sacks in 2013, is playing under a $9 million per year contract. Ware could be given the opportunity to earn the money back with not likely to be earned (NLTBE) sack incentives beginning with seven sacks. $7,432,250 of cap room would be gained by parting ways with Ware if the pass rusher is unwilling to accept a pay cut.Frank Gore (RB)-San Francisco 49ersGore turns 31-years-old in May and is scheduled to make $6.45 million next season, which is the final year of his current contract. Running backs in their thirties usually don’t command such a high salary, especially on teams with good depth at the position. Darren Sproles and Steven Jackson, both of whom are 30-years-old, are the next highest paid older running backs behind Gore with $3.5 million and $3 million 2014 salaries, respectively. Marcus Lattimore, who “redshirted “ during his 2013 rookie campaign because of a serious knee injury suffered in college, could be the future of San Francisco’s rushing attack.Gore finished ninth in the NFL in rushing with 1,128 yards in 2013, but only averaged 3.4 yards per carry in San Francisco’s three playoff games. It is unusual for running backs to sustain or improve their production in their thirties especially if they have had a heavy workload previously. Gore is second among active players with 2,187 career rushing attempts and tied for 29th all-time. Although Gore is still performing at a high level, just eleven running backs have ever hit the 1,000-yard rushing mark at 31-years-old. Only five running backs, including potential cap casualty Chris Johnson, are scheduled to make more than Gore next season.Troy Polamalu (S)-Pittsburgh SteelersPolamalu is no longer in the discussion regarding the NFL’s best safety. The 2010 Defensive Player of the Year was named to his eighth Pro Bowl in 2013, but the honor may have been based more on his reputation than his play. Polamalu, who turns 33 in April, has the NFL’s highest 2014 cap number for safeties at $10,887,500 in the final year of a three-year, $29.6 million contract extension. The Steelers would pick up $8.25 million of cap room by releasing their popular safety. Pittsburgh team president Art Rooney II would like for Polamalu to retire with the club. A pay cut could be folded into an extension that lowers Polamalu’s cap number and ensures that he never plays with another NFL team. The three-year deal Ed Reed signed with the Houston Texans averaging $5 million per year could be an important data point for the extension years.Vince Wilfork (DT)-New England PatriotsThe 32-year-old is in a precarious position because he is entering the final year of his five-year, $40 million contract that features an $8 million 2014 salary and $11.6 million cap number. The five-time All-Pro has the fourth-highest cap number among NFL defensive tackles and the second-highest cap number on the New England roster behind quarterback Tom Brady ($14.8 million). The Patriots have slightly under $3.9 million of cap room based on a projected $126.3 million 2014 salary cap.Others: James Casey (TE)-Philadelphia Eagles: $3.985 million cap number/$3.985 million salary; Antonio Cromartie (CB)-New York Jets: $14.98 million cap number/$9.5 million salary; D’Qwell Jackson (ILB)-Cleveland Browns: $9,483,333 cap number/$8,083,333 salary, Davin Joseph (OG)-Tampa Bay Buccaneers: $6 million cap number/$6 million salary; Zach Miller (TE)-Seattle Seahawks: $7 million cap number/$6 million salaryFollow me on Twitter: @corryjoelJoel Corry is a former sports agent who helped found Premier Sports & Entertainment, a sports management firm that represents professional athletes and coaches.

The presidential hopeful’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, has made millions on lucrative book deals and more than $100 million on the speaking circuit. Secretary Clinton has recently begun to earn that kind of money as well.Secretary Clinton received an estimated $14 million advance on her new book last year, and she has earned hundreds of thousands of dollars for each speaking engagement, figures that rival her husband’s. In all, the couple’s net worth is estimated by 24/7 Wall St. to be $55 million, making it one of the wealthiest presidential estates in history.Want to see the net worth of every American president? Click here to read 24/7 Wall St.'s report on all 43 presidents.Like last year, the only currently living president who is counted among the wealthiest of all time is President Clinton.President Barack Obama is not one of the richest presidents. The president receives a salary of $400,000 a year as president, which, while generous, isn’t even close to today’s top executives salaries. The President’s annual income has actually dropped steadily since he entered office. In 2009, the President’s adjusted gross income was $5.5 million. That figure fell to less than $1 million in 2012. This is primarily due to a drop-off in revenue from his prior book deals. 24/7 Wall St. estimates the President’s net worth to be $7.5 million.The net worth of the presidents varies widely. George Washington’s estate was worth more than half a billion in today’s dollars. On the other hand, several presidents went bankrupt.The fortunes of America’s presidents are often tied to the economy of their time. As the focus of the economy has changed, so has the way the presidents made their money.It is not surprising then to find that the first few presidents — from Washington’s election to about 75 years later — were large landowners. They generally made money from land, crops, and commodity speculation. Of course, this left them highly vulnerable to poor crop yields, and they could lose most or all of their properties because of a few bad years.By 1850, the financial history of the presidency entered a new era. Beginning with Millard Fillmore, most presidents were lawyers who spent years in public service. They rarely amassed large fortunes and their incomes often came almost entirely from their salaries.These American presidents were distinctly middle class and often retired without the means to support themselves in anyway resembling the presidential lifestyle. Buchanan, Lincoln, Johnson, Grant, Hayes, and Garfield had modest net worths when they died.At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, there was another significant change to the economy. Large, professionally organized corporations in the oil, mining, financial, and railroad sectors allowed individuals to amass large fortunes.The Kennedys were wealthy because of the financial empire built by Joseph Kennedy. Herbert Hoover made millions of dollars as the owner of mining companies. Indeed, since the early 20th century, the fortunes of many presidents, including Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and both of the Bushes were driven by inherited wealth.The net worth figures for the 10 wealthiest presidents are in 2010 dollars. Because several of the presidents, particularly in the early 19th century, made and lost huge fortunes in a matter of a few years, the net worth of each president is for the peak time. The exception to the 2010 rule are the presidents who are still living and have more recent earnings. In the case of each president, we have taken into account hard assets such as land, estimated lifetime savings based on work history, inheritance, and homes. Wages considered were earned for services as varied as collector of customs at the Port of New York to royalties on books, as well as ownership of companies and yields from family estates.This is 24/7 Wall St.’s list of the richest U.S. presidents."

Having said that, you might be thinking that I, like the parent company aggressively pushing the social network, should stop trying to make Google+ happen. After all, how many social media accounts does one really need?When I first told a friend on Myspace about Facebook, she rolled her eyes. Maybe in the same way you might have shrugged off Twitter when you first learned of its existence. Both have been called fads. So has the entire Internet, for that matter.So why join Google+ in addition to (or even in lieu of) Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and their ilk? It started for me as curiosity after I had used Google Buzz. It wasn't that I was ""done"" with Facebook, but I wanted to see what Google could bring to my social networking experience, which I thought was still lacking.On Google+, I've found a blank canvas to create, share and interact with people all over the world. It's a chance to be openly expressive on a platform where there are no preconceived notions of people who think they ""know"" me. You might have a lot of strong political opinions or a love of food porn pictures that you want to share with the world, but hold back on Facebook in fear of what your friends might think.You can enjoy this blank canvas and find a place to share what you're truly passionate about, too. Here are 12 reasons you should give Google+ a second chance, if you haven't already:1. Easily Control Who Can See Your StuffLet's say, for example, you want to share a post with only 10 people, but not the entire world. It's as simple as typing your friends' names into Google+'s share box. And if someone's not on Google+? If you include their email address, they'll get an email that lets them read your post. (Though the email will, understandably, ask them to join the network.) On Facebook, you must go through the tedious process of creating a specific group of people to privately share anything, and you can't share outside the social network. And what about disabling comments or reshares? Can't do it on Facebook, but you can on Google+. 2. Google+ Is A Photographer's ParadiseGoogle+ is full of amazing photographers, but you don't have to include yourself in that category to appreciate what the social network offers. Google+ can automatically back up your Android or iPhone pictures privately as you take them (no other social network does that), and offers you tools to improve the tone, color and saturation of your so-so camera phone pics. There's also something called ""Auto Awesome,"" a set of photo-editing tools that can automatically merge a burst of five or more pics into a GIF, erase people in the background of photos or add animated snow and twinkle to shots, among other tricks.3. Unlimited Space To Rant It's unclear exactly what the character limit is on Google+ -- some say it's 100,000 -- but it's absolutely clear you get a LOT more space than other social networks offer. Facebook only lets you rant for about 60,000 characters, and, of course, Twitter give you only a paltry 140. Neither allow any of the flourishes like bolding or italics that Google encourages. If you're looking for some free self-expression and have plenty to say, Google+ is the place for you. Have at it, Interwebs!4. You Can Find Your Interest SoulmatesGoogle+ lets you join or create a ""Community"" on any topic you are passionate about -- immediately connecting with people who also love zombies, or whatever you might be into. The communities can be used as places to have passionate discussions, or just for meeting like-minded friends. You can also create a private community and save posts to read later. Do you like travel, sci-fi, or animals? You can find fellow enthusiasts on Google+.Right now, Facebook is where your family and friends are. Google+ is where you can discuss your interests and passions with people who like the same things you like.5. Celebrities Ignore You On Twitter, But They Won't On Google+Celebrities didn’t take to social media in big, genuine ways until Ashton Kutcher blew up on Twitter. Now, instead of just reading their tweets, you can regularly find all kinds of VIPs on Google+ who will give you the time of day, including astronaut Chris Hadfield, actress Jeri Ryan, tech geek Robert Scoble and Captain Kirk himself, William Shatner. Even luminaries like President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama might actually give you face time on the social network that Reddit or Twitter can't emulate.Jeri Ryan hanging out in 20126. Did I Mention How Awesome The People On Google+ Are?The best part of the entire Google+ experience is meeting other regular people. People have dated, fallen in and out of love, gotten married, made lifelong friendships, formed business relationships, gotten new jobs and found places to crash when traveling abroad -- all from hanging out on this network. Anything can happen: One day I was made into a zombie by Canadian artist Byron Rempel. The next day I hung out with Dell founder Michael Dell. Spend enough time on Google+, and you'll (virtually) run into characters like bodypainter Paul Roustan, toy collector Michael Mozart, news anchor Sarah Hill, radio personality Jane Ellen and chef Larry Fournillier. Australian artist Ashlan Nathens displays a love note he made in honor of Google+ community7. You Can Start Your Own Hangout On Air Show And Reach The World Through A Live Video BroadcastA Hangout On Air is a live HD video event that you can schedule in advance, easily invite people to watch on Google+, and use in a number of awesome ways. People have used them to host their own videocast to talk about Game of Thrones, chat with photographers, hold an ""Open Mic,"" and even interview Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Liam Hemsworth.Every week, you can join a FOX-11 Los Angeles Celebrity Interview Hangout to interact LIVE with a mix of cool celebs, meet up in the Virtual Star Party to see views via telescope that are out of this world, join the Collectors Hangout to discover the largest cool collections of anything from Legos to World War II memorabilia, weigh in on how your sports team is doing in the Sportschat.TV, or find out what tech device to purchase in an episode of Google+ Weekly.On Google+, there was a Virtual Landing Party for the Curiosity Rover from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Paul Roustan showed us how he bodypaints a nude model (NSFW), the community got to interact with Vic Gundotra, the head of Google+, the National Finals Rodeo Fanfest in Las Vegas  was brought to life in hangouts, and there was even an online music concert festival rocking Google+! A Virtual Star Party on Google+8. Star Wars Tuesday Forget Twitter and its Follow Friday. May the +1 be with you.9. Google+ Hangouts Happen In Real Life, TooA ""hangout in real life,"" or HIRL, happens when a bunch of Google+ enthusiasts actually meet in person. I've organized three HIRL weekends so far in New York. When you meet people you've hung out with on Google+, it can feel like you’ve known them forever. This following HIRL moment is from a concert of Google+ musicians, in which Canadian singer Ryan Van Sickle invited me up on stage for my New York singing debut.10. Google+ To Learn About Google GlassUnsurprisingly, those who've shelled out hundreds of dollars for the privilege of testing a Google product have taken to Google+ in a big way. There are a ton of excellent Google Glass-related photos, videos and other information on the social network for those thinking about buying the face computer when it finally goes on sale at the end of the year. If you want to watch people using Google Glass, circle Glass Explorers Brett Lipton, Daniel Fontaine, Bobbie Today, Derek Ross, Robert Warren, Jeris JC Miller, Laurie Des Autels, Mike Elgan, Shaker Cherukuri, Katy Kasmai and Peter McDermott to get a taste.11. GIFs!With the exception of Tumblr and more recently Pinterest, Google+ is the only major social network to let you share and view GIFs. Posted GIFs animate on both desktops and mobile devices, and you can even choose a GIF as your profile pic or cover photo.12.
