But if you look at Renaissance artworks that depict Jesus, you will not find any evidence of a Jew inside the Christianized Jesus -- even though the Gospels in the New Testament tell us that Jesus was Jewish to the core.Getting that point across to the public is a daunting task, as I learned in interviews I conducted for my book Jesus Uncensored: Restoring the Authentic Jew. It's true that many of the people I talked to acknowledged that Jesus was Jewish. But when I questioned them further it turned out that ""of course he was Jewish"" really meant ""he used to be Jewish."" Recently I've discovered that some people firmly state that Jesus was Jewish but at the same time deny it. For example, Bill O'Reilly, in his book Killing Jesus, depicts a thoroughly Jewish Jesus who remained dedicated to Judaism throughout his life. Even at the end of his physical life, as he faced crucifixion, Jesus' followers recognized him as Rabbi Jesus. And O'Reilly agrees with scholars who have noted that Jesus' conflict was not with Jews or Judaism but with the leadership that he charged with excessive pride for their emphasis on superficial displays of piety rather than focusing on the spiritual teachings of the Torah. O'Reilly writes: ""Everything they do [the Temple leaders] is for men to see, he [Jesus] tells the crowd they make their phylacteries [tefillin] wide and the tassels on their garments long. They love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues...He [Jesus] denounces them for focusing on such trivial details of religious life as whether to tithe their allotment of herbs and spices, in the process completely missing the true heart of God's law."" That's why I was surprised when O'Reilly attacked me on his TV show (The O'Reilly Factor) for stating that Jesus was a dedicated Jew who didn't propose or start a new religion. First O'Reilly said, ""Of course I affirmed that because it's true."" Then O'Reilly switched gears and accused me of being ""off the rails"" for my critique of Renaissance art for denying Jesus' Jewish identity and presenting him as Christian. I had cited as an example a fifteenth-century painting by Jan Swart van Groningen in which Jesus is holding a crucifix --an image like many other Renaissance paintings in which baby Jesus is pictured holding, or is in the presence of, a crucifix and other Medieval and Renaissance Christian images. I had pointed out that these images are alien to Jesus' origin and heritage, and I reiterated that Jesus did not launch Christianity. ""That is false,"" snapped O'Reilly. ""He [Jesus] clearly instructed his disciples to teach a new theology."" Too bad that O'Reilly didn't have the opportunity to tell that to the disciples of Jesus who, after the crucifixion, continued to identify with Judaism and to worship and preach in the Temple in Jerusalem. For three decades the disciples, led by Peter and Jesus' brother James, argued with Paul in defense of orthodox Jewish doctrines; the disciples considered their theology Jewish revisionism not a new religion. Christ in a Landscape by Jan Swart Van Groningen -- Musée des Beaux-Arts de MontréalBill O'Reilly is not alone in his belief that Jesus was Christian and that he started a new religion. Many other pundits and lay people believe that as well. A massive body of artworks denying Jesus' Jewish identity has supported the contradiction of the Jewish Jesus of the Gospels and the Christian Jesus of Renaissance art. More puzzling and disturbing, though, is the failure of the art world to acknowledge and expose the falsification of Jesus' identity in artworks. The extensive commentaries on Renaissance art in museum exhibits and art books give detailed descriptions and analyses of the fine points and technical features of the works but ignore one of the most glaring features: the falsification of biblical history in denying Jesus' Jewish identity. For example, Dennis Geronimus, associate professor and chairman of art history at New York University, in his lavishly illustrated scholarly biography of Renaissance artist Piero di Cosimo, writes at length about Piero's artistic brilliance. Geronimus also informs us that ""X-radiography, infrared reflectography, and raking light photographs, together with pigment analysis reports,"" have been applied to Piero di Cosimo's paintings to uncover stages in his creative process.But like other commentators on Renaissance depictions of Jesus, Professor Geronimus makes no mention of the obvious historical falsifications in many of Piero di Cosimo's religious paintings (which do not require x-rays to uncover), such as Holy Family With Saint Joseph, Young Saint John the Baptist and Angels.  Holy Family with the Young Saint John the Baptist and Angels by Piero di Cosimo--wikigallery.orgThe Holy Family and John the Baptist are presented in this painting (and others) as Christian, emphasized by the crucifix, which actually was a hated symbol in the first century and certainly not a devotional object. In fact, according to the Gospels, John the Baptist, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph were dedicated to Judaism; Christianity did not even exist as an idea during their lifetimes. In February 2015 the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC will launch an exhibit of the works of Renaissance artist Piero di Cosimo (1462-1522), curated by Gretchen Hirschauer in association with Dennis Geronimus. Many of the works that will be included in the exhibit are still housed in the churches for which they were produced. The National Gallery exhibit will, no doubt, be enthusiastically received by the art world and art lovers, since the last limited exhibition of Piero di Cosimo's art was in 1938 at the Schaeffer Galleries in New York City. In an interview with the New York Times about the forthcoming exhibit, curator Gretchen Hirschauer said: ""He's an artist whose time has come.""

2,ENTERTAINMENT,Are DJs Taking Over Music Festivals?,Jessica Goodman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/duke-dumont-interview_n_5675327.html,,2014-08-14,"LOS ANGELES, CA - NOVEMBER 03: Electronic music artist Duke Dumont performs during Day 2 of the HARD Day Of The Dead electronic music festival at Los Angeles Historical Park on November 3, 2013 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Michael Tullberg/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4711d2200004301dc1c82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A few hours after his first appearance at Lollapalooza, Duke Dumont retreated in his dressing room. Surrounded by bottles of water, some fruit, a few bags of chips and the cool breeze from a nearby air conditioner, the British DJ/ producer was just happy to sit down. He'd only been in America for a few hours and had already played a monster mid-day set at the festival's EDM tent. Soon, he'd leave Chicago's Grant Park to warm up for his next show, a Lolla afterparty with Flume and Anna Lunoe.""Being here is certainly getting a lot easier than when I first DJ'd in the U.S. about seven years ago,"" Dumont said. ""That was just tough."" Though he was already known as a ""producer's producer"" in the British electronic scene, Dumont started playing small dive bars in New York's Alphabet City, where his crowds were more into hip-hop than his house sound. (""It was a very virgin audience,"" he recalled.) But with just a few weeks until his single, ""Won't Look Back,"" comes out in the UK, he's on a mission to makes American fans fall in love. ""House music isn't really overly popular in the U.S. at the moment. I think of myself as kind of flying our little flags.""After two No. 1 hits on the UK Singles Charts and a long and steady career producing hits and remixes for the likes of Lily Allen, Haim and Santigold, Duke Dumont's name is no longer met with a question mark here in the States. He's house music's answer to mainstream crossover hits.""Need U (100%)"" made 2013 Dumont's year. The collaboration with MNEK and A*M*E went straight to No. 1 in Britain and was nominated for a Grammy. ""It was the first No. 1 house track in, I don't know, about 15 years,"" Dumont said. ""There was a history of house tracks getting to No. 1 in the UK in the ‘90s, which paved the way for me."" But he claims it wouldn't have gone to the top with big audiences had it not been for Disclosure's previous success. ""'White Noise' was in the top 10, and what Disclosure did was very different than what was going on before on a mainstream level. They changed the mainstream consciousness a little bit.""The success of another single, ""I Got U,"" released earlier this year, launched Dumont onto the front stage of American electronic dance music. With beach vibes and stunning female vocals, it hit No. 1 on the U.S. dance charts with ease. After making the rounds at Coachella, Osheaga and Lolla, Dumont has cemented his role as a performer, not just a behind-the-scenes wiz, and he knows the power electronic music can have at a massive festival where the main goal is simple: have fun.""Our job is to entertain,"" he said. ""I think there's is a little bit of a divide between the rock bands and the DJs. A DJ will turn up and the songs will be loud, mastered, compressed. A lot of rock bands will play live, so sonically they might not be as powerful as a DJ set. Festivals are quite tough for rock bands to compete with DJs now, just because the music is a lot more energetic.""His success is on par with electronic music's growing influence, in which acts like Coldplay and Ariana Grande enlist Avicii and Zedd for hits. ""There was a chain reaction going on in the UK and I kind of get a sense right now that it’s happening a little bit in the U.S.,"" he said. ""I’ll be here a lot more in the next few months.""""Won't Look Back"" comes out in the U.K. on Aug. 24 via Blasé Boys Club, and will be released in the U.S. via Astralwerks at a later date."
3,COLLEGE,Recapping the Women's College Advantage,"Diane Propsner, ContributorWomen’s College Alumna, Advocate, and Blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/womens-college-advantage_b_5669531.html,"As a women's college alumna, my contention is that women's colleges are today's best kept secret in higher education. It's the main reason I started blogging and with so many advantages, it would be remiss of me not to continue to do so.",2014-08-13,2014-08-11-HuffPost_AmandaStup_ArtfullyCaptured.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-11-HuffPost_AmandaStup_ArtfullyCaptured-thumb.jpg," Photo Credit: Amanda Stup -- Artfully CapturedAugust marks my one-year anniversary as a Huffington Post blogger. To celebrate this milestone, I decided to write a year-in-review post. I'll begin by saying how much fun it's been blogging about women's colleges. This incredible opportunity has allowed me to take a closer look at these institutions and connect with students and alumnae. The experience has been truly inspirational, and one I greatly appreciate.As a women's college alumna, my contention is that women's colleges are today's best kept secret in higher education. It's the main reason I started blogging and with so many advantages, it would be remiss of me not to continue to do so. Especially now, with more college-bound high school girls and their parents looking for a college education that is affordable and provides a quality education. In addition, single-sex colleges give our youth, girls and boys, the opportunity to decide which learning environment is best for them. Having educational choice is important. Regardless of your higher education preference, single-sex colleges add to our diverse education system; and it's this diversity that makes our education system noteworthy. When you review the research conducted about women's colleges, it's clear: Women's colleges excel at educating young women, and graduates of women's colleges achieve higher rates of success than their female counterparts from coed institutions. Couple this with affordability, and you have a winning solution. The often overlooked nuance of this winning solution, and one worth highlighting, is that colleges for women offer more than excellent academics and affordability; these single-sex colleges provide a learning environment conducive to young women. Here young women are supported and encouraged to think, to explore, and to dream big. It's an environment where no one will ever tell a student that she can't do something simply because she's female.Imagine being in an environment where anything is possible; where options and opportunities abound; it's like being handed the keys to the kingdom. And only the student decides what she wants to do with such an opportunity. For high school girls who have big dreams, it's an option I encourage them to investigate further. I started my HuffPost blog journey by blogging about several high school girls who did just that: they investigated; and in the end concluded that attending a women's college was right for them. I included the stories of Jenni Miller (Stephens College), Briana McCall (Sweet Briar College), Allison Chi-Tsen Wu (Smith College), and Jocelyn Mosman (Mount Holyoke College) in my blog post that explained why first-year students attend women's colleges. Following up with the same students to see how their first semester went; I wrote, ""First Semester College Reflections.""For my second blog post, I penned, ""Why First-Year STEM Girls Attend Women's Colleges."" Here you learned about Christine Hamilton and her interest in engineering and why she selected Smith College, Sue Turjman on her journey to becoming a physician at Mount St. Mary's College, De'Jahnna Crockett from Stephens College and her career goal of becoming an oncology pediatric physician. I also introduced you to two Douglass Residential College students Courtney Stevens, another student interested in engineering, and Jamie Wooding on her quest to becoming a veterinarian. In addition, you learned about Bayley Lawrence, '14, and Delor Sander, '13, students at St. Catherine University and their summer internship in Iceland, studying the effect of temperature on nitrogen fixation rates in geothermally active streams. As a STEM woman myself, the connection between STEM careers and women's colleges is of particular interest to me. So I know you'll understand my delight when I read about influential STEM leaders who are also talking up this powerful connection in ""All-Girls Schools Cited as Key to Women Winning in Tech."" And it's great seeing others sharing the secret as well. For example, these women's college alumnae: Pamela Melroy, pioneering astrophysicist and NASA astronaut from Wellesley College, class of 1983, and Gillian Maffeo, director of marketing at Wayback Burgers from Cedar Crest College, class of 2008 talk about their alma maters and the influence the schools had on their careers. As the year progressed, I suggested that women's colleges are magnets for students who are looking for options and opportunities, and I blogged about going from STEM Girls to ""FUN Gals"" in a lab that studies disease-causing fungi, traveling the United States to create a documentary film, designing clothes based on marine biology, getting more girls interested in STEM, playing lacrosse like a shark, creating amazing pieces of art, taking part in summer internships, including STEM internships while receiving a top-notch education. I also shared how women's colleges are committed to educating first-generation students when I introduced you to Jennifer Eadie.And the fun continues after graduation for these women. I blogged about recent graduates landing exciting jobs and shared career stories from other alumnae including a marine biology advocate, an up-and-coming software engineer, a fashioner designer who won Project Runway with her amazing designs, and a music producer who created a movement for getting more women in her profession. No doubt about it, women's college alumnae go on to do amazing things. College affordability was addressed in ""How to Afford a Quality College Education for Your Daughter"" and another blog post brought to light a generous scholarship created by a group of women college alumnae.In December, I shared with you college-made videos celebrating the holidays in my blog post ""From Their Hearts to Your Home: Videos of Women's Colleges Holiday Wishes."" And in early spring, it was hard for me to resist not sharing ""Happy""- inspired videos (thanks Pharrell Williams for the inspiration). Women's colleges are always looking to stay current and relevant; one way is by creating new programs. Take for example a new illustration program that provides women an opportunity to compete in the male-dominated gaming industry. This is yet another example of how colleges for women are dedicated to educating women and to close the gender gap.For commencement, I got a bit carried away and wrote four graduation-related blog posts, ""Crazy Cool Commencement Caps and the Women Who Designed Them,"" ""Graduating College Women Talk About The Douglass Difference,"" ""First-Generation Student Graduates with Honors and Shares Her College Experience,"" and ""Memorable 2014 Graduation Images from Women's Colleges.""Looking forward, I want to continue to blog about the advantages of women's colleges for high school girls. I'll also expand my reach, specifically exploring (and blogging about) how colleges for women are committed to educating non-traditional women (women over the age of 25), as well as women around the world.To learn more about women's colleges, visit my blog: Advantages of a Women's College. Here's you'll find additional information as well as a complete listing of all women's colleges in the United States.Before signing off, I would like to thank the Huffington Post for this amazing opportunity. I greatly appreciate this platform for sharing the biggest secret in higher education today, women's colleges!"

6,CRIME,The Dirt Wars: An Intimate Look at Convict Culture in American Prisons,"Christopher Zoukis, ContributorAuthor, Federal Prison Handbook: The Definitive Guide to Survi...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-dirt-wars-an-intimate_1_b_5672848.html,"American prisons foster a culture of violence, hatred, bigotry and dominance. They take the criminally inclined, and not so inclined, and turn them into hardened convicts who, after a period of years, become dangerous men.",2014-08-13,2014-08-12-prisonguardatdadecorrectionalfacilityflorida.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-12-prisonguardatdadecorrectionalfacilityflorida-thumb.jpg,"American prisons foster a culture of violence, hatred, bigotry and dominance. They take the criminally inclined, and not so inclined, and turn them into hardened convicts who, after a period of years, become dangerous men. These dangerous, hardened convicts are then turned loose onto our city streets to do what they will; mostly commit crimes and return to prison. This is the sad state of American corrections, the land where I currently live. In an effort to show the type of culture prevalent in American prisons, I present my own personal experience with fighting over dirt on a recreation yard at a prison where I once served time. While I now see that the whole situation was stupid and idiotic, at the time, I was ready to go to blows about who kept on stealing the dirt that I used when working out (via the use of dirt weighted bags). This is my story, which illustrates the problem with the current convict culture. Several years ago I was at a prison where we dug into the ground on the recreation yard with plastic cups to create dirt piles that we would use when working out. The dirt would go into homemade weight bags (often made in sandbag fashion by sewing the bottom of a severed prison-issued pant leg), which we would then lift like regular dumbbells. The problem was that someone was stealing the dirt from my pile -- dirt that I felt that I had a proprietary claim to since I had created the pile in the first place. I was angry, and ready to fight. ""You don't understand. They keep on sneaking around and stealing my dirt when I'm not on the yard. I use the dirt. I dug the hole. And I'll be damned if I allow someone else to steal it,"" I growled at my cellmate.At this, I realized that I was having an argument about stabbing someone over dirt in a prison recreation yard. Dirt that was there before I was born, and dirt that will be there long after I die. Dirt! We were talking about stabbing someone over who had the right to a certain pile of dirt. At the time I felt that I had a certain element of convict morality on my side. They probably felt the same way. After all, in prison, it's understood that what you can take becomes rightfully yours. And if you can't protect something, then you have no right to it. That's just the way it is in prison, at least as far as the convict culture goes. In hindsight, I see that this was an idiotic thing to be angry about; certainly not worth someone being stabbed or dying over, but it felt right at the moment. At that moment I was ready to put it all on the line to ensure that I, and my dirt, for that matter, was given the requisite amount of ""respect."" And I'm one of the more rational ones.This is the disease that permeates American corrections. Prison administrators worry that by selling sugary soft drinks that inmates will make prison wine (called ""hooch"") -- which they will do regardless of whether or not there are sugary sodas -- while the inmates fight over dirt, who sits where in the chow hall (a matter that people die over every year) and who sits where in the TV Room (another matter that inmates die over). I suppose that the prison administrators would rather that the convicts kill one another than learn their rights and ensure that the rules are adhered.  The field of corrections in America has gone awry. Instead of focusing on rehabilitating prisoners and finding ways to make them employable upon their release from custody, prison administrators look for ways to subjugate those in their charge. They search for ways to repress individuality, and rule by coercive force, which only breeds a harder, angrier, more violent prison population. They then foster the thoughts and engage in the activities that you'd expect of a convict, like fighting over who has the right to dirt in a prison recreation yard. Prison officials would rather spend their dollars on stun batons, concussion grenades and yet another solitary confinement cell, than on college courses, drug treatment programs and anger management therapy groups. Until we -- as united and informed people -- refuse to accept the status quo, problems like the dirt wars will continue. But who really cares about the dirt wars? What we should care about is the travesty of sky-high recidivism rates (most prisoners return within three years of release), which is preventable through education and rehabilitation, but which aren't made available to those in desperate need of them. As a friend explained to me years ago (I'm loosely paraphrasing):For every security camera installed, that's a year's worth of books that are not in the education department. For every bullet shot into a prison recreation yard to stop a fight, that's a pen and a pad of paper. And for every additional prison guard hired to deal with the increasing violence that has resulted from abrasive and cruel policies designed to stifle and repress, that's one less psychologist to lead a drug abuse class. They would rather beat us, chain us and lock us in the hole than treat us and fix us.It raises very good questions. Why not treat wrongdoers so that they no longer break the law? Why insist on beating and abusing inmates mentally and physically and then preparing for their eventual return rather than fixing them in the first place? It seems backwards, but then again, that's the way it is, and, perhaps, the way that it has always been, and so will continue to be."

A famous actor and comedian takes his own life in dramatic fashion. His body of work includes characters who deliver powerful speeches about depression, torment, the afterlife, and even suicide. News media rush to release gory details about his death scene. Fans who felt an emotional connection to his work share their feelings publicly -- in the millions. Some hail him as a tortured genius and compare him to other ""great artists"" who took their own lives. Many offer hope that he has ""found peace"" or is perhaps ""hanging out"" with other deceased celebrities, having a good laugh. It's so hard not to react and get these feelings off our chests, but maybe we should stop a moment to reflect before we do. It is shockingly easy to unintentionally glorify suicide. Williams was a great talent, no doubt, but are we inadvertently communicating to others that they, as well, could find more love, comfort, and appreciation if they copied his act?I was very fortunate to learn about how to discuss acts of suicide in public as part of my work with the It Gets Better Project for our touring production, it gets better. The It Gets Better Project was started by Dan Savage and an amazing team of other visionaries as a way to help combat youth suicide -- particularly in the LGBT community. My eye-opening training, conducted by the Trevor Project, was my first introduction to the risks of mishandling suicide stories in public media. It is well-documented that media coverage of a suicide can actually contribute to additional acts of suicide -- an effect known as ""suicide contagion."" Now that social media have made us all effectively part of the media, this seems like a good time to review a few salient guidelines for reporting on suicide. These were published as part of a collaborative report by 10 globally respected groups, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of Mental Health, the Office of the Surgeon General, and the World Health Organization. 1. Dramatizing the impact of suicide through descriptions and pictures of grieving relatives, teachers or classmates or community expressions of grief may encourage potential victims to see suicide as a way of getting attention or as a form of retaliation against others.The report also cites a 1984 study by I. M. Wasserman that found that celebrity deaths by suicide are more likely than non-celebrity deaths to produce imitation.The guidelines listed here have been violated thousands of times in the last 24 hours. We can do better. With great wifi comes great responsibility.To be clear, though, I am not an expert on this research or effect. I only know enough to suggest that we be more mindful. I invite comments and additional reporting to help keep the conversation going, and I apologize in advance if I have mishandled this information in any way. Please know that my intent is simply to generate reflective thinking as part of our cycle of reporting, posting and commenting on this tragic story and future stories.Suicide.org offers an additional media suggestion worth considering if and when you choose to comment on the Williams story:Always provide suicide prevention information with suicide stories.In that vein, please see below:Need help?

8,POLITICS,How Obama Suddenly Became Pro-Worker,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-executive-actions-labor_n_5673000.html,,2014-08-13,"US President Barack Obama gives the thumbs up as he walks out of the White House in Washington on October 7, 2012 before departing for a campaign swing in California. AFP PHOTO/Nicholas KAMM (Photo credit should read NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d2a8240000310098f508.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In May 2013, low-wage workers in federal buildings in Washington began walking off the job in a series of one-day strikes. Employed by concessionaires and janitorial contractors at places like the Smithsonian and the Ronald Reagan Building, the workers said their rock-bottom wages weren't enough to survive on. Like the Walmart and fast-food workers also going on strike, they asked for better working conditions and a greater share of the spoils.Calling themselves Good Jobs Nation, and backed by the Change to Win union federation, the workers crystallized their grievances into a clear policy demand: A higher minimum wage for workers employed under federal contracts. They enlisted members of Congress -- most notably Reps. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), co-chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus -- to pressure President Barack Obama on the issue. And Demos, a progressive think tank, put together a series of reports making the case for presidential executive action. In January, the workers' demand ended up on the largest of possible stages: The president's State of the Union address. Kicking off what he deemed a ""year of action,"" Obama announced that by executive order he would set a minimum wage of $10.10 per hour for workers under federal contracts, a move he urged Congress to follow with a raise to the federal minimum wage. The announcement was a clear response to a coordinated campaign by a group of progressive allies, including minimum wage workers, and it augured similar executive actions to follow.""This outside agitation has really helped push the president to do the right thing,"" Paco Fabian, a spokesman for Change to Win, which includes the Service Employees International Union, said recently. ""And he certainly deserves credit. For the first time in a long time we have a president taking executive action to help workers.""The contractor minimum wage was just one in a slew of liberal workplace reforms Obama has undertaken unilaterally in recent months. He directed the Labor Department to make more workers eligible for overtime pay. He expanded minimum wage protections to cover previously excluded home care workers. He signed an executive order barring discrimination against LGBT workers by federal contractors. And just two weeks ago, he signed another executive order that will force contractors to self-report labor law violations and will bar many of them from receiving federal dollars. One of the order's specific aims is to discourage wage theft.Most of these proposals are relatively limited, applying only to workers whose pay is funded by taxpayers, rather than all U.S. workers. And in their nature as executive rules and actions, they can be easily undone by a future president with the stroke of a pen. But for the progressives who've agitated for these policies -- in many cases going back years -- the reforms are meaningful and can help set higher standards for private employers.""If you put these policies together, they have the potential to reach millions of working people,"" said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who was previously the chief economist for Vice President Joe Biden.During Obama's first term, Bernstein directed the White House's Middle Class Task Force, which was created soon after the president took office, in part at the behest of labor unions. The task force was meant to develop just the sort of reforms that Obama has recently put into action. But by Bernstein's own admission, the task force led to few tangible policy changes early in Obama's recession-hobbled tenure. ""You only have so much bandwidth when you're an administration,"" Bernstein said. ""We were dealing with a pretty cataclysmic recession, and health care reform absorbs lots of time and energy and personnel. I think that once the economic recovery is more solidly underway you can turn a little bit more to job quality over just quantity."" According to David Madland, director of the worker project at the Center for American Progress, or CAP, the executive actions are an obvious response to both congressional gridlock and the national discussion surrounding income inequality. Like Bernstein, Madland said he'd much rather see such reforms made into law through comprehensive legislation. But he said even the contractor rules are ""still potentially getting at one in five workers in the workforce."" ""You clearly have an increasingly intransigent Congress thats blocking any sort of action, so the president, if he wants to reduce inequality and boost wages, he's got no choice but to do things on his own and through executive powers,"" Madland said. ""You also have, at the same time, a growing realization that these efforts are part of how you rebuild the economy.""CAP, highly influential in Democratic politics, had been urging the administration to enact the recent executive order on contractor compliance.Trade groups and many Republicans have denounced Obama's actions on contracting, saying compliance will raise costs on employers and fuel more lawsuits. Some of the reforms have long and complicated histories that don't bode well for their longevity. For instance, the president's compliance order had a previous iteration with the Clinton White House, which, at the urging of liberal groups, had tried to tie federal contracts to firms' adherence to labor and environmental standards. Clinton implemented the reforms in the final days of his presidency, only to see the administration of George W. Bush quickly revoke them.Similarly, Obama's proposal to expand labor law to qualify more workers for overtime pay would merely override a move by the Bush administration that limited eligibility. The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank that's advocated for new overtime guidelines for years, has called the updated rule ""an important first step"" to addressing stagnant wages. Yet a subsequent administration would have the ability to reverse the rule once again.But a future president probably wouldn't do so with much public support, said Bill Samuel, director of government affairs for the AFL-CIO labor federation. At a time when low-wage worker strikes are making national news, Americans may be more likely to embrace reforms seen as beneficial to workers on the bottom of the economic ladder, like a higher minimum wage or expanded overtime pay.""I think this lines up very well with where the public is these days,"" Samuel said. ""They're facing economic challenges and time pressures, and these [actions] are meant to address those. I don't think Republicans will get any traction if they want to roll these back. These ideas are going to take hold.""With a few months left in this so-called year of action, progressive worker advocates say there are other steps Obama should take. CAP's Madland, for instance, would like to see executive action requiring greater disclosure of 401(k) fees. And Change to Win's Fabian said his group would like to see the executive branch implement ""labor peace"" agreements, which have become common on the city and state level and make it easier for workers to unionize. ""These are certainly steps in the right direction,"" Fabian said of the executive orders already on the books, ""but there's a lot more he could do.""Enjoy reading this article?

9,WORLDPOST,Why It's Hard to Believe Israel's Claim That It Did Its Best to Minimize Civilian Deaths,"Idan Barir, ContributorFormer Crew Commander, Israeli Artillery Corps",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/israel-gaza-civilian-deaths_b_5673023.html,"I write this with great sorrow for civilians hurt on both sides. Sorrow for our soldiers who have fallen in this operation, and sorrow for the future of my country and the entire region. I know that as I write, soldiers like me have fired shells into Gaza. They had no way of knowing who or what they would hit. Faced with so many innocent casualties, it is time for us to state very clearly: this use of artillery fire is a deadly game of Russian roulette. The statistics, on which such firepower relies, mean that in densely populated areas such as Gaza, civilians will inevitably be hit as well. The IDF knows this, and as long as it continues to use such weaponry, it will be hard to believe when it claims to be minimizing civilian deaths. As a former soldier and an Israeli citizen, I feel compelled to ask today: have we not crossed a line?",2014-08-13,"Israeli soldiers of the 155mm artillery cannons unit fire towards the Gaza Strip from their position near Israel's border with the coastal Palestinian enclave, on July 21, 2014. World efforts to broker a ceasefire in war-torn Gaza gathered pace as Israel pressed a blistering 14-day assault on the enclave, pushing the Palestinian death toll to 558. AFP PHOTO/MENAHEM KAHANA (Photo credit should read MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13ba9240000330024ed42.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Among the difficult reports streaming in from Gaza over the past few weeks, two especially painful events have captured my attention.The first was the shelling of a UN school building in Jabaliya, where a number of families that had escaped or been forced to flee their homes had taken refuge. At least 15 civilians were killed, and dozens more wounded. Israel argued they were targeting an area from which fire had been directed at Israeli forces.The second was the bombing of a bustling market in the Shuja'iya neighborhood. At a time of precious few opportunities for civilians to safely buy food and other vital supplies, 16 people were killed and around 200 were wounded. Shops, stalls and merchandise were burned or destroyed.Harsh criticism of Israel followed each incident but -- as in the past -- Israel defended its actions, arguing that it was targeting militants and doing its best to avoid civilian casualties.I served as a crew commander in the Israeli artillery corps at the beginning of the Second Intifada, and I feel compelled to counter this claim from Israel. The images, evidence and army reports from recent operations in Gaza -- of more than 1,900 deaths (a number which will likely increase by the time you read this) and a large amount of the population left without shelter -- show that Israel has deployed massive artillery firepower. Such firepower is impossible to target precisely.Artillery fire is a statistical means of warfare. It is the complete opposite of sniper fire. While the power of sharpshooting lies in its accuracy, the power of artillery comes from the quantity of shells fired and the massive impact of each one.In using artillery against Gaza, Israel therefore cannot sincerely argue that it is doing everything in its power to spare the innocent.The truth is artillery shells cannot be aimed precisely and are not meant to hit specific targets. A standard 40 kilogram shell is nothing but a large fragmentation grenade. When it explodes, it is meant to kill anyone within a 50-meter radius and to wound anyone within a further 100 meters. Furthermore, the humidity in the air, the heat of the barrel, and the direction of the wind can all cause unguided shells to land 30 or even 100 meters from where they were aimed. That is a huge margin of error in somewhere as densely packed as Gaza.The imprecision of this weaponry is so great that Israeli forces are compelled to aim at least 250 meters away from friendly troops to ensure their safety -- even if those troops are sheltered. In military terms, this distance is called the ""safe range of fire."" In 2006, when shelling was first used against the Gaza Strip, the ""safe range of fire"" for Palestinian civilians was reduced from 300 to just 100 meters. Shortly afterwards, a stray shell landed inside the home of the Ghabeen family in Beit Lahiya, killing a young girl, Hadeel, and wounding other members of her family. In response to this and similar tragedies, human rights organizations appealed to the Israeli High Court of Justice to cease this lethal practice, and in June 2007 the Attorney-General announced that no more artillery fire was to be used in the Gaza Strip. But just a few years later, during Operation Cast Lead, extensive artillery fire was again aimed at the heart of the Gaza Strip. And up until the recent ceasefire, throughout Operation Protective Edge, Israel has fired thousands of artillery shells into Gaza -- causing intolerable harm to civilians and widespread destruction, the extent of which will only be fully exposed when the fighting ceases.It's true that in at least some cases, the army has informed civilians of its plans to attack a certain area and advised them to leave. But this in no way excuses the excessive damage and huge toll on civilian lives.I write this with great sorrow for civilians hurt on both sides. Sorrow for our soldiers who have fallen in this operation, and sorrow for the future of my country and the entire region. I know that as I write, soldiers like me have fired shells into Gaza.They had no way of knowing who or what they would hit.Faced with so many innocent casualties, it is time for us to state very clearly: this use of artillery fire is a deadly game of Russian roulette.

12,COLLEGE,Hundreds Call On Dartmouth To Make A BIG Change,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dartmouth-greek-system_n_5673263.html,,2014-08-13,"Dartmouth College Phi Delta Alpha fraternity members, sophomore Tommy Albright, front, and junior Patricio Delgado, relax on the balcony of their fraternity house in Hanover, N.H. Thursday, May 24, 2007. The battle for the soul of Dartmouth is being waged in elections for the Ivy League school's board of trustees, which steers its policies and hires top administrators. (AP Photo/Cheryl Senter)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae50651f0000df0022e4b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hundreds of Dartmouth College students and alumni are proposing that the Ivy League school implement dramatic changes to, or even eliminate, the Greek system on campus. As part of its ongoing effort to address concerns about the social climate on campus, Dartmouth has enlisted a committee of faculty, students and staff essentially to crowdsource reform, soliciting input online and in person from various stakeholders to find out what they would like to see changed.The college received more feedback focused on the Greek system than on any other subject, including hundreds of suggestions that Dartmouth abolish fraternities and sororities. More than four times as many people suggested the Greek system was a problem than those who said it was not. In addition to the roughly 260 who said it should be abolished, dozens of others called on the college to increase regulation or to require all houses to go coed.The college received feedback online from more than 1,600 members of the Dartmouth community, close to 1,300 of whom were alumni. Dartmouth has also conducted 53 meetings with alumni, and another 35 with students, to discuss ways in which the Ivy League school should reform its social scene.Additional analysis from those in-person conversations is not available, Dartmouth media relations director Diana Lawrence said. The college, she said, is posting some of the early email feedback ""in the interest of transparency,"" and more information will be shared ""when and if that is possible.""""I'm not at all surprised this is the response the committee got,"" said Dartmouth Philosophy Chair Susan Brison, who's been at the college for 28 years. ""I'm surprised and pleased that they're making it very public.""Brison said the current effort reflects well on Dartmouth President Phil Hanlon, an Alpha Delta alum who took office last year and has kept all options on the table. However, Brison added, implementing changes could be a different story.Approximately two-thirds of current Dartmouth students belong to a Greek house on campus, making the system the dominant force among the college's social scene.When Hanlon made his April 2014 speech outlining the current effort, he said Dartmouth's social scene was often ""at odds with the practices of inclusion that students are right to expect.""The school is trying to avoid repeating the missteps of the previous reform effort of 1999, when then-President James Wright launched the Student Life Initiative, which sought to force all Greeks to go co­educational, with a promise to end hazing and ban kegs.Students overwhelmingly objected, with 83 percent of students polled by the student newspaper saying they preferred to retain the single-­sex system. Students marched on campus in protest and compared Wright to Benedict Arnold and Judas.Alumni of Greek organizations met with trustees and administrators and successfully lobbied to stop some of the major reforms, like forcing houses to go coed.""I remember [Wright] saying to me at one point, 'None of the unaffiliated came out -- they're not organized,'"" said longtime Dartmouth English professor Ivy Schweitzer. ""They don't get marched out in their hats and their sweatshirts by their organization.""Wright isn't the only Dartmouth president to suggest Greeks should go away: David McLaughlin made the argument in 1997 after leaving office. ""I really came to the conclusion that probably the fraternities needed to be eliminated and that the whole system should be redesigned ... We should have gotten rid of the fraternities -- that's a reluctant conclusion,"" McLaughlin said in an interview with Jane Carroll, who's now Assistant Dean of the Faculty. McLaughlin said that getting rid of fraternities would've required money while alienating a number of stakeholders, so the trustees moved on to other agenda items, focusing instead on improving behavior among the fraternity members. McLaughlin said he believed they only slowed the ""deterioration of the system.""Alumni have opposed interference with Greeks in the past.In 2010, according to alumni council documents, Greek organizations, working with the college and alumni, pressured the Hanover Police Department against conducting sting operations to bust fraternities for alcohol violations. However, it's not to say the college hasn't punished Greek houses when it deemed necessary.Zeta Psi was ""permanently"" booted off campus in 2001 for distributing newsletters that included ""patented date­rape techniques"" and detailed sexual activities between brothers and female students. In 2009 the fraternity was officially reinstated after lobbying by alumni, Alumni Council documents indicate. Just last year, Theta Delta Chi was suspended and given additional probation as part of sanctions for incidents related to alcohol and parties, and Beta Alpha Omega was suspended during a hazing investigation.From 2010 to 2013, college documents show that 33 student organizations -- 87 percent of them Greek -- were found responsible for community standards violations. A majority of the cases involved alcohol, and typically led to college or social probation. Ten houses were found responsible in four or more separate hearings, but none were suspended during that period.The only specific change the administration has discussed so far is the creation of more residential communities for new students, not unlike Harvard College's residential houses, that could serve as an alternative to the Greek system for some students.""It's important to keep in mind that the committee is not polling or holding a vote on recommendations, nor can it speculate on what will be considered feasible,"" Lawrence said. ""Their final suggestions will be generated in light of expert opinion, best practices, and the committee's collective judgment. Their charge is to recommend ideas that have genuine promise for implementation and impact.""The committee is scheduled to present its findings and recommendations to Hanlon by October.Lou Spelios, president of the Dartmouth Alumni Council, said his group does not have a position with respect to ""general or specific changes"" to the Greek system."
