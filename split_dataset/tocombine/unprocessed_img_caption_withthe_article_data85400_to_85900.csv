Below you will find the first acceptance of this olive branch by Whitney Threadcraft-Walker.Whitney Threadcraft-Walker is a doctoral student in the Department of the Administration of Justice at Texas Southern University. Her research focuses on the interaction between gender, race and crime, as well as prisoner reentry.A curious affair happened a few weeks ago when assorted media outlets looped footage of 15 year old Dejeeria Becton being slammed to the ground by Officer David Eric Casebolt in McKinney, Texas. The emergence of yet another controversial recording of an encounter between a police officer and an unarmed citizen hardly gave the nation pause, nor did the subsequent backlash that followed. Instead, more interestingly, the national conversation on police brutality did something it had never done before, centered itself around the gender specific violence experienced by Black women and girls at the hands of law enforcement officers. Despite the efforts of such movements as #SayHerName and #BlackWomensLivesMatter, members of the general public are more likely to know the names of Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, and Walter Scott than Rekia Boyd, Mya Hall, or Kathryn Johnston, who similarly died after encounters with police. While most agree that these conversations are a step in the right direction toward a pathway of increased parity in policing, it can be argued that the notable absence of Black women and girls from this sociopolitical dialogue of victimhood is simply another link in a successive chain of apathy toward those at the very nexus of institutionalized gender and race- based violence. Historically speaking, violence toward Black women and girls is just as conventional in the U.S. as barbeque on the Fourth of July. Some might even argue that violence against Black women is more common than the Fourth of July as the holiday occurs only once a year. For context, consider the hellish experience of those women and girls forced across the Atlantic to this country for their unpaid labor nearly three centuries ago. Faced with near daily promises of rape and other varied forms of assault, enslaved Black women were powerless to resist the violence of slave masters, or fellow slaves for that matter, as colonial laws did not grant legal recourse to chattel. Black women and girls had no claims to their own bodies as private or autonomous beings as they were repurposed for public consumption to be used and abused at the whim of those not only with authority and power, but by those possessing the means, opportunity or mere inclination. In this regard, the violence endured by Black women and girls became so common place because it was purposive, in a sense that it was meant to subdue and orient Black women and girls into a subjugated place in society. Accordingly, threats of rape and other similar violence in order to dominate, intimidate and threaten persisted from the Post Reconstruction Era well into the Jim Crow South. A time that produced such social change agents as Recy Taylor, Claudette Colvin and Endesha Mae Holland who stalwartly imparted their experiences with sexual violence to better detail an often neglected, and far less publicized, accounting of the seeds of social injustices that germinated the Civil Rights Movement. With the horrors of slavery and the Jim Crow Era serving as the bedrock of sexual violence against Black women, few are familiar with the nameless African slave women who endured medical violence while serving as guinea pigs for Dr. J Marion Sims, often referred to as the father of modern gynecology. Widely regarded by many as an intrepid pioneer, while others question the ethics of operating on a captive population incapable of consenting to treatment; Dr. Sims perfected the technique for treating vesico-vaginal fistulas by performing surgeries on enslaved Black women. Often these surgeries occurred outside in a corner of his yard that he had relegated for his slave subjects, without anesthesia as these women were thought to feel less pain than their white counterparts. Similarly, this same logic has had modern manifestations in contemporary medicine as studies indicate that implicit racial bias influenced both Black and white physicians alike, as they routinely provided inadequate pain management and recommended more invasive procedures to Black women. Plainly stated, this failure to recognize the pain and suffering of Black women by those tasked with the very obligation of healing and care speaks to a larger social context where the inability to register the very humanity of Black women has been normalized. This apparent apathy for Black women and their suffering is not limited to the annals of history or medicine, in fact it can be easily observed in numerous aspects of social life. Take for instance the reluctance of mainstream media to cover the hundreds of Black women and girls who go missing every year. Just this month the remains of two Black teen girls were found on the same stretch of interstate in New Orleans within weeks of each other, a story that has yet to garner national, or regional, attention. Further, even in stories where Black women comprise the majority of those who have suffered, the conversation still tends to center on males. The shootings that took place at Emmanuel AME church in Charleston on June 17th provides one such example. While no one can lament the remembrance of the victims of this tragedy, the breadth of media attention has focused near exclusively on the Reverend Honorable Clementa C. Pinckney. President Obama has already been confirmed to not only attend his funeral, but deliver the slain public servant's eulogy. Although, six of the nine victims who died that day were Black women, there has been negligible media coverage describing the lives or achievements of these women. Some might point to Reverend Pinckney's position as a state senator as the rationale for his increased coverage, however those individuals need only consider the fact that outside of a thoughtful write up on the online community Buzzfeed, little else has been presented to attest to these women's lives, careers or accomplishments. Few, if any, mainstream media outlets have discussed the fact that Sharonda A. Colemon-Singleton was a noted speech language pathologist at an area high school in Charleston, or that Cynthia Hurd obtained a masters degree in library science and went on to use that degree working for the Charleston County Public Library systems for over 30 years. These women were far more than could be conveyed in a 10 word byline or a 15 second sound bite, as such it is imperative to acknowledge their humanity beyond a footnote on a terrible page of American history. Undoubtedly, in the wake of the shootings the general public arguably knows more about self-confessed shooter Dylan Roof than any of the women he killed. This story and others like it reinforces both the low level of concern for Black women as victims, while simultaneously discounts their victimization as commonplace. Further still, the failure to register the varied forms of violence visited upon Black women extends beyond the realms of medicine, history, media and the state, into the most sacred of private domains, the home. Consider the stark reality that data compiled using the FBI's Supplemental Homicide Report found, indicating that Black women are more than twice as likely as white women to be killed by men. Despite the fact that the majority (52 %) of these women were killed by significant others, there has been a veritable lacuna of national initiatives or policies that address this form of violence aimed at Black women. In sum, the issue is clear: When Black women are victims of violence, the response (given there is one) from the general public is lukewarm at best. Moreover, the impassivity that Black women are met with when they are victims of violence is not a new phenomenon. On the contrary, there is long and complex history of Black women and violence in this country that has occupied the periphery of both public and private conversations of victimhood. The victimization (and apathy toward said victimization) of Black women is so thoroughly ingrained in the collective consciousness of this country that it can indeed be considered mundane, the status quo, or normal. In terms of crime, the type of gut wrenching violence that took the lives of nine innocent citizens in Charleston occurs relatively infrequently. The glossing over of Black women as victims of violent crime, however, is sadly, more common than not."

5,RELIGION,Ecstasy And Despair On This Historic Day,"Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, ContributorFormer Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, T...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ecstasy-and-despair-on-this-historic-day_b_7671784.html,"I am rejoicing today, and ecstatic that in the years to come, the love that I share with my husband and the love that millions of other LGBT Americans experience will be honored and that LGBT people will have gained dignity and justice at last.",2015-06-26,2015-06-26-1435334250-9128644-ScreenShot20150626at11.57.13AM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-26-1435334250-9128644-ScreenShot20150626at11.57.13AM-thumb.png,"My husband Brad and I were married in our small church two and a half years ago in a ceremony that included just the priest and two witnesses who were volunteers from the church. Yet, despite its small size, the wedding was a monumental experience, made much more so that it was held within those church walls where we worshiped, and where our love was considered sacred and our vows were understood to be binding before one another and God. Yet, we were painfully aware that outside the walls, our vows could be legally evaporated merely by crossing a state boundary. In a very real sense, it was within our church where we felt most fully human and beloved by our community and by God. To many in the outside world, our love was a fiction that they could erase with a wave of an official hand. So, on this day, I am thankful to God for the Supreme Court's decision and to the American people, who are so rapidly recognizing that our love is no longer debatable. It hard for people who have not had the right to marry whom they love to understand what it means to have your government change its mind, after so long, to finally think of you as 'human enough' to enjoy the full benefits of citizenship.For Brad and me, and now for our son, the decision by the Supreme Court to legalize gay marriage across the country is like a gate being opened and entrance granted into the hereto guarded sanctum of being considered fully human. And so I am rejoicing today, and ecstatic that in the years to come, the love that I share with Brad and the love that millions of other LGBT Americans experience will be honored and that LGBT people will have gained dignity and justice at last. And yet, today, my heart is also despairing. On this great day of celebration, there is also a funeral and great mourning of the loss of the life of Rev. Clementa Pinckney and eight other African-Americans who were shot in Charleston. For those nine African-Americans, the church was also their sanctuary. And Mother Emanuel AME was a church where, throughout its history, African-Americans were afforded full human dignity when the outside world wanted to enslave them. That sacred sanctuary was brutally violated just days ago by a twisted, sick shooter and today, we mourn the loss of ""The Beautiful Nine."" In a legal sense, African-Americans gained the long fought and centuries overdue recognition of their humanity in the Supreme Court and in the Congress a few decades ago. Despite this, the last year of police brutality in Ferguson, New York, Cleveland, Baltimore and now Charleston shows us the limits of these rulings. And the Supreme Court itself gutted some of those same civil rights in a recent ruling. African-Americans still live within a deeply racist America that now has invaded the sanctuary of the church. Despite this, anyone who watched the church service at Emanuel AME last Sunday knows that the Church may have been broken into, but it is anything but broken. That sanctuary has a strength and will not be diminished by sin and hate, but will ultimately grow stronger.  Senior Pastor, Rev. Clementa Pinckney, hugs a church member after the Watch Night service at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina January 1, 2013.The church that performed my wedding to Brad and Emanuel AME church are two very different places, but both are important reminders of the role church must still play in the world. No matter what the Supreme Court ruled today, it will still be dangerous for Brad and I to even hold hands in most of America, must less embrace or kiss. For African-Americans, just walking down the street or driving can be a cause for racially-motivated harassment or violence. In a world that continues to diminish and discriminate, the church, if it is to mean anything at all, must be a sanctuary for all people to be fully themselves and feel the dignity and pride in who God made them -- whatever race, gender, sexuality, culture, religion or size. On this day of celebration and mourning, let the church lead the calls for continued justice, compassion and love for all of humanity. Remembering American martyrs like Rev. Clementa Pinckney and the Beautiful Nine as well as those Americans who have died as the result of anti-queer violence, let us all work together towards that great day when we can wipe away all the tears of oppression and discrimination and join hands as one people, free at last.Also on HuffPost:"
6,POLITICS,What's Missing From the Marriage Decision,"Adam Winkler, ContributorProfessor of Law, UCLA",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whats-missing-from-the-ma_b_7672048.html,"While those of us who support marriage equality are right to rejoice, there remains one thing missing from Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion: he refused (once again) to say that all laws that discriminate against LGBT people are subject to heightened judicial scrutiny.",2015-06-26,"WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 8: The nine members of the Supreme Court pose for a new group photograph to reflect their newest member, Elena Kagan, October, 08, 2010 in Washington, DC.

And while those of us who support marriage equality are right to rejoice, there remains one thing missing from Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion: he refused (once again) to say that all laws that discriminate against LGBT people are subject to heightened judicial scrutiny.For decades, the Supreme Court has held that some aspects of personal identity are not usually a valid basis for treating people differently, including race, sex, and national origin. To protect against those forms of discrimination, the Court insists that laws that use these factors must meet heightened judicial scrutiny to survive. This means that courts reverse the usual presumption in constitutional cases that laws are constitutional. Under heightened scrutiny, laws are presumed unconstitutional and the government is required to show strong reasons to justify the disparate treatment. Prisons can separate prisoners on the basis of race to stop a race riot, but they can't do so for convenience or cost savings.One of the issues raised in the marriage case was whether laws that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation should be subject to heightened scrutiny. Although the Supreme Court has invalidated some laws that discriminate against LGBT people, including the Defense of Marriage Act, the Court has consistently refused to identify what standard of review -- heightened or not -- such laws must be subject to. In the marriage cases, the Court, per Justice Kennedy, failed to do so again.While Kennedy's refusal is easy to overlook in the celebration over marriage, it can have a profound, adverse impact on LGBT people. Lower courts can read Kennedy's opinion in future cases, such as challenges to laws against gay adoption, and say that it doesn't require heightened scrutiny. So long as the government has any plausible reason to justify the distinct treatment of an LGBT individual, the court can uphold the law.Kennedy's seeming unwillingness to require heightened scrutiny -- he's done it now in 4 major gay rights cases -- could make it harder for LGBT people to fight discrimination in the marketplace, such as refusals of service by wedding cake bakers or florists. The Court in Hobby Lobby said that businesses have religious rights and can, on that basis, refuse to follow generally applicable laws. Yet the Court also said that religious freedom wouldn't justify racial discrimination because the government has a compelling reason to prevent such treatment. If the Court had in the marriage cases held that heightened scrutiny applied, it would have sped the way to recognizing a compelling governmental interest in combatting LGBT discrimination.The significance of any Supreme Court case is largely in how it influences the next case to come along. Justice Kennedy had a chance to make it much harder to justify anti-LGBT discrimination in future cases. That he didn't gives the silver cloud of the marriage equality decision a slightly dark lining."

After months of hearing from conservatives and fundamentalists about how they were going to secede, leave the country, or burn themselves in effigy over same-sex marriage, the day has arrived. The Supreme Court has rendered their decision in a 5-4 ruling that same-sex marriage is to be law of the land.As a result of this ruling, same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marry, and states cannot take that right away from them. The decision requires all 50 states to recognize all legally performed marriages from all jurisdictions, and to extend marriage to same-sex couples. In short, the court's decision requires all states to treat marriages of same-sex couples exactly as they treat marriages of different-sex couples.On April 28, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in cases from each of the four states that make up the Sixth Circuit: Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. It had challenged plaintiffs and defendants to answer two questions:Question 1: Must states allow same-sex couples to marry under the United States Constitution?Question 2: Must states recognize the legal marriages entered by same-sex couples in other jurisdictions?The Court this morning answered yes to both.That means there a number of things that we can all look forward to. Here are just a few.Breitbart's hate bag, John Nolte, will not see the rainbow flag taken down, burned, or banned like the Confederate battle flag. Here's what he wrote in his vitriolic bigoted blog post:Under the banner of what is dishonestly called a gay pride or gay ""rights"" flag, hate, fascism, and intolerance has festered for years, specifically against Christians and conservatives. Under the auspices of a ""rights and equality"" symbol, Leftists have been on a rampage to take way the rights of others through bullying, lies, and online terrorism.The list of misdeeds and victims resulting from an increasingly emboldened Big Gay Hate Machine continues to grow.In case it wasn't obvious, that was about the gay-pride flag, which he'll be seeing a lot more of in the coming days.Joseph Farah, founder of WorldNetDaily, the one-stop shop for right-wing lunacy, sent out an all-points bulletin to governors last week suggesting that they secede from the union if SCOTUS rules against state bans of same-sex marriage. We can look forward to him and his followers leaving the country. I suggested Somalia as a perfect bastion of libertarianism and homophobia.Earlier this month, Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, in an unfortunate choice of words, suggested that homosexuality was being ""crammed down [the] throats"" of Christians, noting that Tiffany's & Co is ""advertising wedding rings for gay couples."" Graham called for a boycott of the jeweler and Wells Fargo, which apparently both use same-sex couples in their ads. Ironically, he posted his outrage on Facebook, whose CEO and founder marched alongside his employees in 2013 in San Francisco's pride parade. He and his flock are going to run out of places to shop and bank pretty quickly.Another particularly nutty preacher, Rick Scarborough, an ex-Southern Baptist Bible thumper who runs Vision America and the Judeo-Christian Council for Constitutional Restoration claimed he had congressmen interested in signing a pledge to oppose any court ruling making same-sex marriage legal:We're saying, before that, we will never obey that tyrannical law. It's counter to natural law, and God's higher law... We will simply refuse to comply with recognizing same-sex ""marriage"" as legitimate. The Supreme Court does not have the inherent right [to make that change]. We're going to continue doing what we've always done ... they better have a lot of prisons and jails.Then he said:Now the high court is threatening to unleash the spirit of hell on the nation, if they deny what nature clearly teaches on this subject of gender and marriage.And, here's the good one:We are not going to bow, we are not going to bend, and if necessary, we will burn.That's right: He's prepared to burn to death to fight gay marriage. Here's the clip:Tom DeLay was stoking homophobic fears and warning of a massive revolt if the Supreme Court rules to strike down gay marriage bans. ""If this Supreme Court rules against marriage, all hell is going to break loose,"" DeLay said on The Steve Malzberg Show.DeLay went on to say that he had pledges signed by politicians, including -- who else? -- Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who have vowed to defy a ruling by SCOTUS. Of course, neither of them holds any political office, but why should that matter? They're the dynamic anti-gay duo.During the interview, while DeLay is ranting about ""all hell breaking loose"" if gays marry, he pulls out an idea we'll be hearing a lot about and attempts to explain that anyone who ""understands the Constitution"" knows that the legislative and executive branches do not need to enforce a Supreme Court ruling, ""and not only that, if the states would just invoke the 10th Amendment and assert their sovereignty, they could defy a ruling by the Supreme Court."" And that's relevant to anyone who doesn't care to look deeper than ""Gays can't marry because it's gross"" or ""Being gay is a choice.""And here's one that's going to be loads of fun, and one we can look forward to: Glenn Beck and religious-right activist Jim Garlow have 10,000 passionate pastors prepared to give up their lives if necessary in the fight against the coming persecution of Christians:The number in the Black Robe Regiment is about 70,000 now. The number that I think will walk through a wall of fire, you know, and possible death, is anywhere between 17,000 and 10,000. That is an extraordinary number of people that are willing to lay it all down on the table and willing to go to jail or go to death because they serve God and not man.Time and time again the Republicans are being shown by SCOTUS and by the people of this country that they are consistently wrong in their views.

9,QUEER VOICES,"Please Just Stop, Clarence Thomas",Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clarence-thomas-dissent_n_7672064.html,,2015-06-26,"Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas pauses while speaking about his time as a student at College of the Holy Cross after receiving an honorary degree from the college, Thursday, Jan. 26, 2012, in Worcester, Mass. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafde213c000066000ba8c4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Today is a beautiful day. It's a day of progress and celebration for those who have fought for and supported marriage equality in the United States. The Supreme Court ruling signifies a brief, shining moment of solidarity and joy. I don't want to ruin this moment. But we need to talk about Clarence Thomas. More specifically, we need to talk about Clarence Thomas's dissent. It's unsurprising that the notoriously conservative Justice Thomas voted against marriage equality -- his track record when it comes to this issue has been consistently closed-minded. But the arguments made in his same-sex marriage dissent have reached new, terrifying heights of absurdity (and this is a man who once argued that the NBA is proof that racial imbalances aren't always a bad thing). That absurdity needs to be acknowledged. In one horrifyingly obtuse paragraph, Justice Thomas demonstrates his simplistic concept of oppression. He writes:""The corollary of that principle is that human dignity cannot be taken away by the government. Slaves did not lose their dignity (any more than they lost their humanity) because the government allowed them to be enslaved. Those held in internment camps did not lose their dignity because the government confined them. And those denied governmental benefits certainly do not lose their dignity because the government denies them those benefits. The government cannot bestow dignity, and it cannot take it away.""Human dignity cannot be taken away by the government? Really? Slaves, who were lawfully stripped of their culture and religion, taught that they were inferior to whites and not even fully human, forced into lives of servitude, abuse, rape, mental and emotional anguish, were not robbed of their basic human dignity? Really? Clarence Thomas is married to a white woman -- something that would have been illegal today if it weren't for the Supreme Court's historic Loving v. Virginia ruling which deemed discrimination against interracial marriage as unconstitutional. It's dangerous to equate too heavily the black civil rights struggles with those of the LGBT community, but the irony here is still profound. Does Thomas see his marriage as a mere government benefit? If the law of the land stated that he and his wife couldn't be married, simply because he is black, would his dignity truly remain intact? Would he have no sense of injustice?At the end of the day, Thomas's dignity argument is wholly irrelevant. The dignity of slaves doesn't absolve the United States of its sins. The dignity of Japanese Americans held in internment camps didn't make the discrimination any less real. This idea that maintaining one's dignity makes oppression, marginalization, and the denial of basic human rights okay is beyond ridiculous. If Clarence Thomas is against marriage equality, so be it: there's nothing he can do about it anyway. But the fact that a Supreme Court Justice could use this reasoning as justification for his decision? That's downright undignified. "

Like, really have a serious conversation about weddings and why they're one giant, annoying, unnecessary, selfish, Ponzi scheme. Yes... a Ponzi scheme. Now before you flip your shit and morph into Bridezilla v2.0, let me explain what's happening this weekend. I have to go to a wedding this weekend. Sucks to be me, I know. It's not even a friend of mine. It's my girlfriend's friend, which is like... the worst predicament to be in. But she gets it. She asked me last night if I could ""pretend to have fun."" She is not ""like other women."" ◊◊Sandwiched in between barbecues, fireworks, and annoying kids free on school vacation, the summer brings with it the annual and (what seems to be) endless run of weddings. All sorts of weddings, too. Black-tie barn weddings (such an oxymoron). Vineyard weddings. DESTINATION WEDDINGS!!! GET IT??!! DESTINY-destination wedding! OMGOMG WE'RE SO IN LOVEEE COME TRAVEL FIVE HOURS TO SEE US KISS!The established wedding, as we know it to be, is the ultimate ""gotcha"" event. Every time I go to one I'm always waiting for some van to pull up and a camera crew to jump out of that sliding pedophile door with cameras and a spotlight and just scream something like, ""YOU'RE ALL SUCKERS FOR FALLING FOR THIS!!"" This hasn't happened yet (sad emoji). ◊◊If you've had a wedding, or are planning one, more specifically since social media has been around, you're kind of an asshole. Not a huge one. But you still are one. Oh, no? Don't think so? Tell me how you're not. Please. Because what basically happens is that you send me a piece of expensive cardboard, what you call a ""Save-the-Date,"" telling me to put aside a  weekend three years into the future, in the middle of summer, which, if you didn't realize, was peak vacation season.  ""Do I want to go to Nantucket this weekend, or your wedding in Hoboken Nantucket? [Does the scale thing with my hands] Hoboken?""You're an ass. When most people just want to head to the beach after a shitty work week to drink some cheap beer out of a tumbler or  have sex in Cannes (SFW), you can't. Or I can't this weekend. Booking a hotel room (OH BUT I'M GETTING A RATE SO IT'S ALL GOOD!!) sucks. They never have early check-in on a Saturday for some reason. And then I have to hope that I don't gain three pounds by 2017 because my only good summer suit is a slim fit. But, okay, I might have to buy a new suit for a couple of hundred bucks, not the end of the world. Oh, but I'll look forward to the bottom shelf open bar that's really only open for twenty minutes during appetizers, so that will cost me thirty bucks with a date and tips. And if it's a destination wedding, i.e., the most egregious of the weddings, it's even more money with travel costs. If you're a woman... I feel for you. I really do. Weddings are tough for women. That purple and yellow bridesmaid dress that not only do you have to buy, but unless you have some semi-formal to go to, will never wear again. Your hair and make-up is, what, $300? Hair that I'm just going to be pulling come midnight (lovingly, of course). Oh.. and the:Engagement shower. Bridal shower. Wedding shower. Bachelorette shower.(Seriously... Can you girls think of another shower?)Oh... the gift! I OWE YOU A GIFT! OF COURSE! How could I forget to give you money for being in love!?? What an asshole I am. Let's call this what it really is. You're asking me for money for being in love. Why can't you just do this shit in your backyard, upload it to Vine so there's a record of it (weddings should last ten seconds anyway), and I'll send you some money. Do you guys have PayPal? What about Venmo? Is your email still JessicaAndBradTieTheKnot@gmail? I know that's what you had on your interactive wedding invitation. ◊◊Still don't think this whole thing is a scam? Fine. You don't have to believe me. Just watch the video below. No, really. Watch it. Then come back to me so we can finish.Are you back? Good. Hahahahahahahhahahaa...I love that the very symbolism of your""love"" is based on complete horse shit that's a century old and from a diamond company worth $6.1 billion that has NOTHING TO DO WITH SELLING YOU DIAMONDS AT ALL. By the way, the guy who made that video is an American hero. ◊◊This weekend, instead of going up to some New England lake house with an organic-craft-one-off-limited-edition-rose hip-beer in one hand, and a cemita in the other, I'm traveling six hours to attend a four hour event. All at my expense. Will I pretend to have fun?Of course.________Image credit: Stock Photo"

Sie sitzen auf dem Boden. Aufgenommen 1997.

Brittany Daniel who played Jessica Wakefield on the series based on author Francine Pascal's books, said the potential for a reboot is not totally out of the question (basically because no one has said ""no,"" yet). “We have a conversation with Francine Pascal in the next couple of weeks so, yeah, we're definitely interested in doing a reboot of that,” the 39-year-old actress told Us Weekly at the premiere of ""Joe Dirt 2"" on Wednesday.The ""we"" Daniel is referring to is, of course, herself and twin sister Cynthia Daniel, who played Elizabeth Wakefield during the show's run from 1994 to 1997. While the show, which detailed the lives of a group of teens in the fictitious Sweet Valley, California, aired on Fox and later UPN, Disney-ABC Domestic Television reportedly now owns the rights to the series. The Huffington Post reached out to the network to see if there has ever even been chatter about putting the program back on the airwaves. Request for comment was not immediately returned. Though ""Full House"" is finding new life on Netflix, it seems doubtful ""Sweet Valley High"" would get the green light for a new generation. The original series was pretty terrible and wasn't exactly a huge career starter for anyone involved -- it did have a great theme song, though. And if there's a lesson from Sweet Valley Confidential, Pascal's spinoff novel which was released in 2011 and picks up 10 years after readers last left the Wakefield twins, it's that it's sometimes best to leave the past in the past.

12,HEALTHY LIVING,"How I Quit Smoking, Stopped Vaping and Learned to Eliminate Stress... One Breath at a Time","Talia Eisenberg, ContributorCo-Founder, Re:Mind and Henley Premium Vapor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-i-quit-smoking-stoppe_b_7641758.html,,2015-06-25,2015-06-23-1435028370-2663260-11067485_867158335852_5260201183199350888_n2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-23-1435028370-2663260-11067485_867158335852_5260201183199350888_n2-thumb.jpg," When I quit smoking with a rudimentary electronic cigarette in 2010, I was so passionate about this viable alternative to combustible tobacco that at the age of 25 I started a vaping company to help others. Slowly I realized that smoking, which became vaping, had caused me to focus on my breath. Inhale, exhale, repeat. This awareness of the breath connected me to something that impacted me far more than the nicotine. And through this epiphany I discovered meditation and how it can help millions of people. Life is f*cking stressful. We're taking care of our own life stuff, and we try to help our friends, families and partners... and keep our careers on track, manage finances, and get ever healthier both physically or mentally and spiritually -- its a lot. All these and more are competing for our attention.And it's causing us to lose our minds. Chronic stress is linked to insomnia, headaches, back pain, depression, and a lot worse. Different people deal in different ways. Some strategies are healthy, some not so healthy, others are obviously harmful. And the last type brings a whole new set of problems for everyone. Reducing the symptoms and sources of chronic stress is serious harm reduction, something I know a bit about.I spent my early 20s in New York City. I went out heavily, partied, had fun, and like many young people took up cigarettes. I found that smoking helped quiet my racing mind, mask my insecurities, and reduce my stress. But after a couple years, and plenty of good times, I found my lifestyle no longer satisfying or even that fun. I needed to make a change.So I left New York and went to Colorado to get sober. Nature knows what we need and the beauty of the outdoors did wonders. I began hiking, practicing yoga, and focusing on what was beginning to matter most in my life. I was able to give up alcohol and every other drug, all except for one: cigarettes. It's a gnarly addiction, and it was my last to kick. Around this time, I was introduced to one of the first e-cigarettes on the market. I took it up in place of smoking. Vaping helped me quit, and I felt so much healthier even as I relied on it to relieve stress. I was determined to get more e-cigarettes for anyone else who wanted to really quit smoking.I decided to launch a business to bring this safer nicotine option to the world. I wanted to defeat Big Tobacco by creating an exciting brand and making harm reduction relevant and way more stylish than smoking. A lot of people thought Henley's ""Fuck Big Tobacco"" campaign was cool and a smart way to draw attention to an industry focused purely on profit at the cost of millions of lives. Customers shared their stories about vaping to overcome addiction to cigarettes. Over four years, Henley grew into a multimillion dollar business and continues to help a lot of people.But despite the clear benefits of vaping vs. smoking cigarettes -- and my personal beliefs and investment -- over the past year I have entirely stopped vaping and using e-cigarettes. I found a new way to clear my head, relieve stress, and even find inner peace, all without the aid of substances: mindfulness practice and meditation. Only later did I find that I was also getting much better rest, lowering my blood pressure, increasing my mental capacity, deeply relaxing and increasing parts of my brain that are vital to creativity, human connection, and being well. My meditation practice -- sitting still and focusing on my breath for 45 minutes a day -- has reduced my stress, strengthened my ability to focus, and reprogramed certain negative thought patterns. I jumped into meditation with the same enthusiasm that I jumped into partying and then into vaping with. It has made me a much happier person.I committed to learning as much as I can about this powerful ancient technology and all the people who have been applying it in their lives. In the last year alone my journey has introduced me to Theravada masters in Myanmar, monks studying ancient text in Pali, and enlightening people in the U.S. on week-long silent Vipassana retreats.I'm studying the science behind meditation. Many studies show that it can help decrease stress, depression, anxiety, pain, and insomnia, and increases quality of life. A recent report by Dr. Sara Lazar, a Harvard neuroscientist, shows that ""long-term meditators have an increased amount of gray matter in the insula and sensory regions, the auditory and sensory cortex,"" which means that meditation actually changes the brain and improves key functions that typically decline as we get older. ""Suddenly, meditation became performance enhancement, as well as part of the journey of discovery,"" says Arianna Huffington, and more and more high-powered people are learning to meditate, from Oprah to Kobe Bryant and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. I read that Steve Jobs, the legendary co-founder of Apple, practiced meditation. He said, ""If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes things worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there's room to hear more subtle things -- that's when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more.""This made me wonder. What would meditation programs and tools look like if they had been made popular and accessible by the genius that brought the world the iPhone?While meditation is becoming stylish and trendy, it remains largely inaccessible for many people. Nearly half the adults in the U.S. report that their stress levels are going up, and 70 percent say they do not know what to do about it. To me that is unacceptable.It is time to bring meditation to the masses. I want places to practice mindfulness to become as accessible as strip malls and for happiness to become as familiar as Happy Meals. Meditation should not just be for Steve Jobs but also for everyday people with regular jobs. People need to know that they can skip that jolt from Starbucks and instead recharge their minds and bodies through the simple act of focusing on breathing in and out. In my life's journey I have tried many strategies to cope with stress and to feel better. I am so grateful to have found meditation, a tool that is not only healthy but a source of inner peace and personal growth. I am committed to helping other people discover and practice the power of sitting still.Talia Eisenberg is co-founder of Henley Premium Vapor and The Henley Vaporium in New York City.

13,LATINO VOICES,This Program Is Empowering Young Latinas To Follow Their Dreams,Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/love-mentoring-latinas_n_7640066.html,,2015-06-25,<em>All photos by Christy Havranek/Huffington Post</em>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e987c052500008d216b7f28.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"A silver necklace that reads “Love” lies flat across Claudia Espinosa’s chest. It's a constant reminder of what matters to her most -- the mentoring program she founded to empower young New York City girls called Latinas On The Verge of Excellence, or L.O.V.E. “Today is about choosing the major that you love,” Espinosa, 36, announces. She’s addressing the six mentors and seven mentees attending L.O.V.E.'s weekly session at The Young Women’s Leadership School of East Harlem. It’s a Friday afternoon near the end of the school year. But the high school students who had been rowdily anticipating the weekend just moments earlier become completely focused when Espinosa speaks. Everyone begins discussing the difference between a major and a concentration when a mentee abruptly asks what happens if she’s not sure what she wants to study in college. “When you go to school, you’re never wasting your money or time,” Espinosa responds, reassuring the student that many people are undecided when they enroll. “Everything you learn will help you!” Espinosa created L.O.V.E. three years ago to mentor young Latinas. Since then, she’s implemented the program in three New York City schools, working closely with the Young Women's Leadership Network in low-income, majority minority communities in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. This fall, Espinosa expects to expand the program to a total of seven schools, including its first in the Bronx.“L.O.V.E. is like a machine, making sure that young girls can fulfill their potential -- and by potential, I mean their biggest dreams,” Espinosa told The Huffington Post. Though the program has grown in a short period of time, Espinosa’s journey really began 15 years ago, when she moved alone from Cali, Colombia, to the U.S. to follow her lifelong dream of becoming an FBI agent. She studied English for two years and became a personal trainer -- a job that still keeps her afloat financially and helped fund her bachelor's and master's degrees in forensic psychology from John Jay College of Criminal Justice. But by the time graduation came around, Espinosa realized the FBI was not for her.While she contemplated her future, Espinosa worked as a counselor at Life Is Precious, a suicide prevention program for Latinas. The experience would, in her words, “change everything.” “[I was] working one-on-one with the girls, 13, 14, 15, up to 17 years old,” Espinosa said. “Girls came in referred from the hospitals saying, ‘Yeah, I don’t want to live anymore.'”Hispanic girls in high school are more likely than their non-Hispanic peers to have attempted suicide. According to a 2012 report by the Centers For Disease Control And Prevention, 13.5 percent of young Hispanic female students said they attempted suicide, compared to 8.8 percent of black, non-Hispanic girls and 7.9 percent white, non-Hispanic girls. Working as a suicide counselor took an emotional toll on Espinosa. “The girls would vent with me, but I would take that and have dreams or nightmares with it every night,"" she said. ""So I quit the job. But then I said, ‘I have to do something.'”Espinosa went back to school, enrolling in a master's program in public administration at New York University, where she worked with faculty to develop the pilot program and curriculum for L.O.V.E.The program was originally designed to pair 10 to 25 students per high school with female college mentors from NYU, Columbia University and the City University of New York. Ideally, college mentors share interests with their mentees and communicate regularly to help guide them from ninth grade to graduation. During after-school L.O.V.E. meet-ups, they listen to guest speakers or discuss study tips, college applications, domestic violence and other topics. While the program was initially intended to target Latinas, L.O.V.E. is open to young girls of all backgrounds. In fact, most of the East Harlem mentees are black, including Lauren Drumgold. The 18-year-old will enter Bates College as a biology major this fall and was recently honored alongside two other seniors at a special L.O.V.E. graduation ceremony. Drumgold, who hopes to become a veterinarian, said she first started getting excited about attending college and studying abroad during a L.O.V.E. mentoring session.“The first year I did it, there was a lady who came and she was a life coach. We had to envision ourselves a few years from now in college,” Drumgold said. “In my school, we talk about college, but you don’t always see yourself there. And at that moment, I was able to see myself on a college campus or across the world studying what I love.”The L.O.V.E. program can be equally eye-opening for the young women who volunteer their time. Amanda De La Torre, 26, is one of the program’s newest mentors and recently earned a master's in higher education and student affairs at NYU.“You can talk about it and write about what people are struggling with and barriers to higher education,"" said De La Torre, who is Mexican-American and mentors a 15-year-old of Ghanaian descent. ""But you don’t see that unless you’re actually in the classroom and involved with them.”“[Barriers can be] little things, like 'What does a major mean?' Not even knowing the terminology is one -- especially for students whose parents immigrated here and are first-generation college students,"" De La Torre added. ""So we talk about female empowerment, fitness, things that maybe you’re not exposed to in your house but you can gain that knowledge here.”Describing the struggles that young girls and Latinas specifically face, Espinosa says that many young women encounter cultural pressure that prevents them from reaching their goals. “I think that there are a lot of expectations for women, and by expectations I mean roles that you should fulfill,” Espinosa said. “You should, yes, finish school, but perhaps later on you should get married, and then you should have a couple of kids, and then you should take care of your family.""""I mean, if you think about the Latino community, that’s what I grew up seeing,"" she added. ""That [outlook] is what I think is still pretty prevalent here.” With L.O.V.E., however, she hopes that will change. “You’re kind of the pillar of the family as a woman,” she said. “So that’s really engrained. ... And as an individual, you have your own goals and dreams and passions. That, to me, is what the important part is.” Espinosa hopes to eventually open high schools that are entirely dedicated to supporting young girls and helping them achieve their dreams. “I think what I see is myself,” Espinosa said. “I moved here by myself and I’ve been doing it alone. So that’s why when someone tells me, ‘No, it’s too hard, I can’t,’ I don’t agree with it. Because even if you are in the hardest situation, you can change that and go for whatever it is that you want to do. That’s the message that I want to convey.”Need help?

15,LATINO VOICES,This Program Is Empowering Young Latinas To Follow Their Dreams,Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/love-mentoring-latinas_n_7640066.html,,2015-06-25,<em>Espinosa (right) speaks with a mentee at The Young Women’s Leadership School of East Harlem.</em>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e987c092500005c06eafbaf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"A silver necklace that reads “Love” lies flat across Claudia Espinosa’s chest. It's a constant reminder of what matters to her most -- the mentoring program she founded to empower young New York City girls called Latinas On The Verge of Excellence, or L.O.V.E. “Today is about choosing the major that you love,” Espinosa, 36, announces. She’s addressing the six mentors and seven mentees attending L.O.V.E.'s weekly session at The Young Women’s Leadership School of East Harlem. It’s a Friday afternoon near the end of the school year. But the high school students who had been rowdily anticipating the weekend just moments earlier become completely focused when Espinosa speaks. Everyone begins discussing the difference between a major and a concentration when a mentee abruptly asks what happens if she’s not sure what she wants to study in college. “When you go to school, you’re never wasting your money or time,” Espinosa responds, reassuring the student that many people are undecided when they enroll. “Everything you learn will help you!” Espinosa created L.O.V.E. three years ago to mentor young Latinas. Since then, she’s implemented the program in three New York City schools, working closely with the Young Women's Leadership Network in low-income, majority minority communities in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. This fall, Espinosa expects to expand the program to a total of seven schools, including its first in the Bronx.“L.O.V.E. is like a machine, making sure that young girls can fulfill their potential -- and by potential, I mean their biggest dreams,” Espinosa told The Huffington Post. Though the program has grown in a short period of time, Espinosa’s journey really began 15 years ago, when she moved alone from Cali, Colombia, to the U.S. to follow her lifelong dream of becoming an FBI agent. She studied English for two years and became a personal trainer -- a job that still keeps her afloat financially and helped fund her bachelor's and master's degrees in forensic psychology from John Jay College of Criminal Justice. But by the time graduation came around, Espinosa realized the FBI was not for her.While she contemplated her future, Espinosa worked as a counselor at Life Is Precious, a suicide prevention program for Latinas. The experience would, in her words, “change everything.” “[I was] working one-on-one with the girls, 13, 14, 15, up to 17 years old,” Espinosa said. “Girls came in referred from the hospitals saying, ‘Yeah, I don’t want to live anymore.'”Hispanic girls in high school are more likely than their non-Hispanic peers to have attempted suicide. According to a 2012 report by the Centers For Disease Control And Prevention, 13.5 percent of young Hispanic female students said they attempted suicide, compared to 8.8 percent of black, non-Hispanic girls and 7.9 percent white, non-Hispanic girls. Working as a suicide counselor took an emotional toll on Espinosa. “The girls would vent with me, but I would take that and have dreams or nightmares with it every night,"" she said. ""So I quit the job. But then I said, ‘I have to do something.'”Espinosa went back to school, enrolling in a master's program in public administration at New York University, where she worked with faculty to develop the pilot program and curriculum for L.O.V.E.The program was originally designed to pair 10 to 25 students per high school with female college mentors from NYU, Columbia University and the City University of New York. Ideally, college mentors share interests with their mentees and communicate regularly to help guide them from ninth grade to graduation. During after-school L.O.V.E. meet-ups, they listen to guest speakers or discuss study tips, college applications, domestic violence and other topics. While the program was initially intended to target Latinas, L.O.V.E. is open to young girls of all backgrounds. In fact, most of the East Harlem mentees are black, including Lauren Drumgold. The 18-year-old will enter Bates College as a biology major this fall and was recently honored alongside two other seniors at a special L.O.V.E. graduation ceremony. Drumgold, who hopes to become a veterinarian, said she first started getting excited about attending college and studying abroad during a L.O.V.E. mentoring session.“The first year I did it, there was a lady who came and she was a life coach. We had to envision ourselves a few years from now in college,” Drumgold said. “In my school, we talk about college, but you don’t always see yourself there. And at that moment, I was able to see myself on a college campus or across the world studying what I love.”The L.O.V.E. program can be equally eye-opening for the young women who volunteer their time. Amanda De La Torre, 26, is one of the program’s newest mentors and recently earned a master's in higher education and student affairs at NYU.“You can talk about it and write about what people are struggling with and barriers to higher education,"" said De La Torre, who is Mexican-American and mentors a 15-year-old of Ghanaian descent. ""But you don’t see that unless you’re actually in the classroom and involved with them.”“[Barriers can be] little things, like 'What does a major mean?' Not even knowing the terminology is one -- especially for students whose parents immigrated here and are first-generation college students,"" De La Torre added.

Nothing. Knock, knock. Silence. Knock, knock. Nada. Finally we hear footsteps on a staircase. The door to this Astoria, Queens NYC home opens ever-so-slowly. ""Hola, Que tal,"" purrs a voice before we even get to see a face. Finally the visage comes into view. The sight takes us back. Henry Arango, three years shy of turning 90, floats toward us a la Norma Desmond.. He's wearing a floor length silk-chiffonish robe in varying shades of flamingo-pink. An arm as long and as graceful as a swan's neck makes an undulating gesture before pointing to his hair. Arango is wearing a two-foot high brunette wig encrusted with pearls every bit as striking as Audrey Hephburn's coiffure as she makes her entrance to the ball in ""My Fair Lady."" And emanating from all that hair (like the rays of a Cuban sun) dozens of outrageously long pink and lavender ostrich feathers. Shock and awe. ""How do you like it?"" he asks coquettishly. ""I got them from the Tropicana Nightclub in Havana before I left Cuba."" We erupt in gales of laughter.  Henry Arango is a witness to 60-years of gay history. He performed as an impersonator in Havana as a young man. Arango watched the blazing fires and gay voices raised in outrage at the Stonewall riots. He marched in the first gay rights parade. He witnessed gays going from lurking in the shadows of dirty movie houses to speaking out and marching in Washington, D.C. for their rights. And as a proud female impersonator at the renown East Village drag venue, Club 82, Arango sashayed and danced exotically for luminaries from Elizabeth Taylor to Errol Flynn. He's lived through the AIDS crisis, seen the progress made toward gay marriage, and beamed like a proud poppa as more and more gays (including celebrities) have had the courage to come out. But when he arrived from Cuba to New York in 1956 (at 18 or 28, according to which ""papers"" one chooses to believe) it was a different story.""Gay life was very underground,"" Arango remembered. ""We were considered third world persons,"" he said. ""You could order drinks (at bars) but there was no dancing. Police raided bars frequently. In the sixties, he remembers there were one or two bars on the Upper West Side and a couple in the Village. ""Mostly they were run by the Mafia,"" he says. Gays flocked to 42nd Street movie theaters for furtive sexual encounters in back rows, he recalled. Sometimes, they would meet in public ""tearooms' (restrooms). By the time the Stonewall and Julius bars opened in the Village, raids were commonplace. Arango said cops believed transvestites or drag queens(who hung out at Stonewall) were engaging in prostitution. The Stonewall also catered to""hustlers""(male prostitutes), young gay men and homeless youth. But drag queens were a favorite target for harassment by police. ""You could not walk around in a dress or wear makeup out in public, "" said Arango. ""But if you were out (dressed like a woman) as long as you wore men's undergarments under the dress, they couldn't arrest you for prostitution.""Amid such an oppressive climate, Arango flourished as ""Adrian,"" an exotic interpretive dancer and sultry femme fatale at Club 82. ""We were impersonators,"" he says grandly. ""The term 'drag queen' was considered trash."" One of Adrian's famed routines featured a ""Dance of The Seven Veils"" where Arango portrayed Salome, the Biblical temptress who asked for the head of St. John The Baptist. Arango borrowed a head from the prop man at the old Metropolitan Opera House. One night he says: ""I was waiting for my cue to go onto the stage when someone grabbed my head and ran off. I thought it was one of the waiters but it was Errol Flynn."" Flynn, ever the swashbuckler, was a big fan of the revue (featuring lesbians dressed as men, men dressed as women, acrobats and strippers).Arango had fled Cuba years earlier after dancing at seedy Havana clubs (El Niche) and upscale ones (Montmartre). He high-tailed out of Montmartre one night when he was performing as Madame Du Barry in a powdered wig. He says men with machine guns burst into the ritzy penthouse club and fired rounds into the audience -- packed with officials of then President Fulgencio Batista's government. Arango says two people were shot and killed. ""I knew I had to get out of there,"" he says with a laugh. By then he claims he had secured an audition at Club 82 in New York. Adios Havana. Hola Nueva York. Fast forward 13 years.On the morning of June 28, 1969, Arango was taking off his makeup after finishing the last of three shows( 11:30, 1:30 and 2:30) when he says someone ran into the dressing room screaming: ""There's a big riot at the Stonewall."" Arango said that he and five female impersonators in the revue sprinted from Club 82 to the Stonewall Bar. ""We couldn't believe it,"" Arango said. ""One of the drag queens was running through the streets screaming 'we got raided.'"" Arango and his friends watched the melee unaware it was the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. ""The queens were fighting the cops. The cops were fighting back,"" he said. ""I saw police cars being put on fire. The drag queens were calling names, throwing rocks,"" Arango said ""And some of them were also throwing their falsies at the police. It was just crazy."" Arango said the guys dressed as gals had forgotten they were drag queens. ""They were now freedom fighters."" According to published reports, it wasn't just drag queens joining in the uprising but hundreds of angry gays and residents from the neighborhood. ""I was applying for my U.S. citizenship so I didn't want to riot,"" Arango said. But he and his pals cheered from the sidelines. The riots erupted into angry demonstrations the next evening. There were even more several nights later.""Things began to change after that,"" Arango remembered. Within months, activist organizations sprouted. They included not only drag queens but prominent gay doctors, lawyers, teachers and professionals as well as gays and lesbians from every walk of life. And on June 28, 1970 the first Gay Pride march kicked off in New York (and Los Angeles and San Francisco). Arango was there. ""We were told by the organizers not to wear any dresses,"" he said. ""I remember as we walked we saw protesters on the side and they were holding a big banner that said ""Fags Are Not Welcome."" Today, Gay Pride marches are held all around the country in late June (the 45th annual New York Gay Pride march will take place on Sunday). The March not only commemorates events at Stonewall but recognition of gay marriage progress, the fight against AIDS (and those who lost their lives to the virus) and the battle against gay bullying and hate crimes. Arango has been marching or attending every one.""I'm glad to have lived long enough to see all the changes,"" he says gesturing with his hands. ""Sometimes I've been angry because we (gays, lesbians, transgenders) are human beings. We're entitled to the same rights as everyone.""Arango has been a member of the Theatrical Wardrobe Union Local 764 for five decades. As a ""dresser,"" he's attended to Anthony Quinn and Laurence Olivier (in ""Beckett""), Mandy Patinkin in ""Evita,"" and Ruby Keeler in ""No No Nanette."" He's also dressed Richard Chamberlain and Michael Redgrave, the cast of ""Cactus Flower"" and ""Funny Girl"" ( ""Barbra Streisand was quiet and very nice""), ""Phantom of the Opera,"" ""Les Miserables,"" and "" Woman of the Year"". Arango's also been a dresser for numerous other Broadway productions, operas (at the Metropolitan Opera and former New York City Opera) and ballets (the ""Nutcracker"" at New York City Ballet). He's never retired.Arango's lost several friends to the AIDS crisis (""A whole group of guys who I knew who came over from Cuba are gone""). But with the sadness he's also felt joy. Arango has applauded strides in gay acceptance, gay marriage (Arango's single) and the coming out of gays including Ellen Degeneres, Anderson Cooper and Ricky Martin as well as prominent athletes. He's especially proud of Caitlyn Jenner ""I'm 100 percent behind her, "" he says emphatically. ""You own your own body.""As for the future , he says he hopes to see gays integrated into every aspect of American life. ""People realize we are here to stay."" he says proudly. I ask him what's his biggest wish for gays in the 21st century. Without missing a beat he proclaims: ""I want to see a gay president. I've seen everything else. Why not?"""

Type in the search word ""best"" plus the spa service and your town. Yelp, Insider, Bing, City Search or some other social media review site should pop up with information on a variety of therapists and spa professionals.",2015-06-25,2015-06-23-1435053663-3892833-zuriprocession_2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-23-1435053663-3892833-zuriprocession_2-thumb.jpg,"My niece graduated from Howard University last year. She seems to be doing well financially. I recently received an e-mail from her informing me that she was thinking of having one or two spa treatments. She wanted to know which ones she should try and as an African-American which were safest for her skin. As a former esthetician and a very protective aunt, I was inclined to tell her that none of them were safe unless I performed them! I realized though that I was being a bit ""extra,"" so I calmed down and provided recommendations on who, what and where she should go.If you are among the other twenty-somethings around the globe also venturing into the world of spa goers, here are five things that you should know:1. Do your research, use that technology!Put Google to work. Type in the search word ""best"" plus the spa service and your town. Yelp, Insider, Bing, City Search or some other social media review site should pop up with information on a variety of therapists and spa professionals. You can drill down further from that point to gauge the perspective of the people providing the critique. Folks who give everyone a poor rating may be worth passing over.2. You don't always get what you pay for!  I've received good massage and wonderful customer service from low cost massage franchises. I've had very luxurious treatments and great service at Five-Star facilities. Unfortunately, price is not always commensurate with a great customer service experience. As a newbie you might want to begin your journey at one of the smaller companies or franchises which offer premium treatments at a deeply discounted price. Again check social media for the best therapist at that location.3. Choose waxers wisely -- avoid injuryOverseas many therapists have dual licenses which allows them to work in multiple disciplines. But this is not the case in the U.S.. Waxing services should never be done in a nail salon unless a cosmetology or aesthetic license is held by the technician performing the service.If you decide to get a waxing service at a spa, whether here or abroad, ask for their most popular or senior wax specialist. Here's why; like playing the piano, waxing proficiency takes time. Even the schools that teach waxing do not provide sufficient practice time for a therapist to build a level of expertise. The learning curve is developed from hands on experience, not theory.Once you are in the waxers room, look for her to test the wax temperature on herself before placing it on your body. That will be a good sign. If she doesn't and the wax feels too hot, speak up. If she ignores you, get up, let the front desk know what occurred and leave.4. Intake forms are importantAt many spas you will be given an ""intake"" form prior to a massage or facial service. This form will ask you to provide your contact information, medical issues and primary reason that you have come to the spa. Your therapist should review this information with you to ensure that she (1) doesn't cause you physical harm (2)understands your needs fully to provide you with the best service. If she does not discuss your form with you, that is a major fail. Inform the spa manager. If you are told that the form was purely for government compliance, post your experience on social media. By the way, even if a form is not used the therapist should conduct an interview with you before starting your treatment.5. Good facialists are hard to findBefore trusting your face to anyone, first schedule a consultation with the esthetician. This will allow you to see if;1. She listens to you.2. She knows what she's talking about.3. You feel gut comfortable with her.Select a facialist who prefers to err on the side of caution. Facials should never cause pain and the skin can only be pushed to a certain point before trauma occurs. Avoid estheticians who recommend extractions or aggressive upgrades the first time around. A facial treatment should leave you glowing, refreshed and looking beautiful. If you are of African, Asian, Latin or Middle Eastern descent, look for someone who has experience working with ethnic skin. Darker skin types in particular are often more sensitive and prone to irritation. Unfortunately most skin care schools are still not adjusting their curriculum to address this growing market.With the international community of spa goers growing rapidly, information on the past experiences of others is easy to find. Social media can be used to share your own spa experiences, good and bad. That's what the sites are there for.If you encounter a serious service problem try to resolve it with the spa manager first or allow the organization to correct the situation. One on one customer feedback should make a good company better.Ultimately though, remember that your opinion has power and could be heard around the world."
18,GREEN,Obama Sides With Republican Climate Change Deniers on Trade Deal,"Jacob Devaney, ContributorFounder and Director, Culture Collective",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-sides-with-climated_b_7650144.html,"If the president truly wants us to #actonclimate, then we should be calling him and our representatives every day and telling them to vote NO on TPP. If TPP is so ""progressive"", then why is it being kept secret?",2015-06-25,2015-06-24-1435119595-4081973-ScreenShot20150623at4.49.29PM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-24-1435119595-4081973-ScreenShot20150623at4.49.29PM-thumb.png,"When I see the White House promote #actonclimate while President Obama is pushing the Trans Pacific Partnership that will reduce regulations on the worlds largest polluters, I get an awful feeling in my stomach. When Elizabeth Warren exposed the dangers of TPP's investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) on working families, the environment, and public health, the president said, ""I take that personally."" Obama still hasn't answered to these important issues yet Congress just voted to give him authority to negotiate the deal without oversight from the American people, environmental groups, health professionals, labor experts, or Congress. Instead he will be negotiating the TPP behind closed doors with many of the very corporations and banks that are responsible for our environmental and economic problems (for a list of 605 corporate insiders and advisors for TPP, visit here). There is good reason that thousands of informed environmental groups, labor organizations and health professionals oppose the TPP.When I see this president buddying up with climate change-deniers like Boehner and McConnell to push this TPA and this trade deal through despite the fact that over 2,000 organizations comprised of environmental groups, public health professionals, retirees, corporate accountability, labor, and small businesses organizations oppose it. I would have to agree that this has gotten ""personal"". With over $200 million donated by corporate interests to buy ""yes"" votes for TPA, it HAS become personal to those of us who actually care about this country, it's people, and it's natural resources. It has become personal to those of us who expect our elected officials to represent the well-being of their constituents instead of wealthy private (corporate) interests. Climate change, social justice, economic equality are all entwined in our increasingly global society.The TPP and other trade deals in the works are not about ""free trade"" that allow local businesses to sell abroad. They are about freeing multi-national corporations from government regulations that are necessary to protect the economy, the people and the environment. These un-democratic, secret trade deals are about preserving privatized monopolies and preventing competition from the public sector. They also move litigation offshore into private arbitrary tribunals. So if we pass local, state or national ballot initiatives to protect our water, air, or our workers, then our government (tax-payers) can be sued by courts outside of our jurisdiction for interfering with projected corporate profits.Elizabeth Warren summed it up shortly after the Senate votes were tallied on Tuesday in a Boston Globe article:And here lies the double standard at the heart of our trade deals: Once they sign on, countries know that if they strengthen worker, health, or environmental standards, they invite corporate ISDS claims that can bleed taxpayers dry... While American negotiators ignore this problem, the rest of the world is waking up and fighting back. After Phillip Morris targeted it for billions in ISDS compensation, Australia began raising significant objections to ISDS. Negotiations with Europe over a massive new trade deal have stalled in part because of objections to ISDS, including from Germany and France. India is considering abandoning ISDS. So is South Africa, after being hit with an ISDS action challenging -- incredibly -- its postapartheid policies promoting minority ownership in its mining sector. Brazil has flatly refused to include ISDS in any of its trade agreements.The presidents #actonclimate initiative is hollow when he is actively pushing to strip governments (and the people) of their ability to regulate climate-offenders by handing litigation over to corporate tribunals. The water we drink, the air we breathe, pesticides in our food, are environmental factors that directly impact our health. Environment, economy, and social justice are all entwined and must be represented in any trade deal. Jean Ross, RN, co-president of National Nurses United, stated: Wall Street and the Chamber of Commerce hardly need more handouts. Nurses will continue to oppose the TPP and other disgraceful trade agreements, and send our own message to our elected representatives that they will have to answer to all Americans whether they stand with Wall Street, big corporations, or the American people.Here's a list of those who stand with corporations regarding the TPA. If they are in your state, you can leave them a message by requesting them at 202-224-3121. They are still yet to vote for TPP.Source: Senate.gov Public Citizen, a trade watch organization, has done a whole lot to blow the lid off of this secret trade deal and educate Americans about what our elected officials are trying to do behind our backs. It is clearly a case of foxes watching the hen-house with a wolf-in-sheeps-clothing president parroting the hollow sentiment of caring about American workers and climate change. Robert Weissman, President of Public Citizen, stated:When the inexcusable and anti-democratic veil of secrecy surrounding the TPP is finally lifted, and the American people see what is actually in the agreement, they are going to force their representatives in Washington to vote that deal down. Members who fail to do so can expect their constituents to hold them accountable.I hope he's right! Will you join thousands of us as we call, tweet and make a loud rumble over this treachery? A recent article in the Atlantic questions if the TPP's ISDS provisions are unconstitutional. More importantly Alan B. Morrison, one of America's leading Constitutional lawyers, stated in a letter mailed to all members of the U.S. House of Representatives, ""The Investor-State Dispute Settlement Provisions in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement Violate Article III of the United States Constitution"". He further added:Given the importance of the ISDS provisions to the TPP, the Administration owes it to Congress and the American people to explain how the Constitution allows the United States to agree to submit the validity of its federal, state, and local laws to three private arbitrators, with no possibility of review by any U.S. court.Politics are generally heartless and without conscience. Our Founding Fathers gave us a representative democracy that only works when citizens participate in it. If you are genuinely concerned about the environment, climate change, or social justice it is your job to hold our leaders accountable. It is the people who bring conscience and heart to our democracy. TPA has passed, now Congress only has an up or down vote on TPP, we still have time to stop the TPP. If the president truly wants us to #actonclimate, then we should be calling him and our representatives every day and telling them to vote NO on TPP. If TPP is so ""progressive"", then why is it being kept secret?"
19,HEALTHY LIVING,Calorie Counting Revisited: Why Trying to Cut Food Calories Could Make Us Fat and Sick,"Sean C.

Epicure's CEO invited me to speak at the company's national conference in Montreal this July to discuss, ""How calorie-focused thinking may mislead an harm public health."" The talk will be based on points I have made with a co-author in: (1) an academic paper, (2) a related letter to the editor, and (3) an op-ed for the general public. As I think about the forthcoming work with Epicure and my forthcoming talk to the company's membership, the case against calorie-focused thinking is worth revisiting. Perhaps most important to emphasize will be that trying to cut food calories -- intended to promote healthy weights and better health -- could actually have the opposite effect; it could make us fat and sick.To explain, first consider that trying to consciously control calorie consumption, by regularly eating fewer calories than we burn, is entirely implausible. Even the best-educated and best-equipped individuals among us will find it near-impossible to determine their actual calorie intakes (not just ingested, but actually absorbed) -- or their actual calorie expenditures (not just in physical activity, but through countless unnoticeable internal metabolic reactions) -- with the necessary accuracy and precision to meaningfully guide behavioral decisions. Moreover, calorie intakes and calorie expenditures are linked. In other words, they are matched, paired, or coupled, physiologically -- unconsciously. If we burn a quantity of calories through exercise, we will be hungrier and eat more to compensate. If we try to consume fewer calories than our bodies need, we will be fatigued (and hungry) and disinclined to activity as an offset. ""Calories in"" will match ""calories out,"" unless some internal uncoupling occurs. Considering calories as undifferentiated units of energy does not get past this problem. Yet undifferentiated units of energy is exactly the logic of the all-too-common teaching that ""a calorie is a calorie."" The idea is that ""a rose is a rose"" and type does not matter. But type does matter (in food and in roses). A calorie worth of walnuts, for instance, is no more like a calorie worth of white cake than a wild prairie rose is like a Himalayan musk rose. Prairie roses and musk roses are different. And walnuts and white cake are different (specifically with regard to their effects on satiety, food consumption, weight maintenance, body composition, and metabolic health).Whereas foods like walnuts are filling, helping to keep overall calorie intake for the day lower, processed products like white (refined) cake drive hunger and compel consumers to eat more (including more later in the day after eating the cake is long forgotten). In particular, appetites for additional refined carbohydrates (i.e., starches and sugars) increase following consumption of initial refined carbohydrates. Products like white cake promote obesity and related diseases like diabetes. In contrast, foods like walnuts promote healthier metabolism and overall better health.Nonetheless, healthy foods like walnuts are much higher in calories gram for gram than refined products like white cake. And this is the problem with calorie-focused thinking and calorie labeling more specifically: an inherent bias against fat-laden foods (regardless of how healthy those food are) since fat is the component of food with the greatest density of calories. Fat bias leads to messages to decrease the intake of higher-calorie fattier foods, even though some higher-calorie fattier foods (and higher-calorie fattier diets) may produce and sustain as much or more weight loss than calorie-restricted or lower-fat diets, as well as promote better health and longer life. For healthier weights and better health, consumers should choose real foods, irrespective of their natural fat content. Unfortunately, policies directed at labeling calories, and campaigns directed at cutting calories, do not steer choice in this direction. Instead, these measures incentivize consumers to demand, and industry to design, products with lower amounts of fat/calories (usually with refined carbohydrates as replacements). Thus, we wind up driving food production and consumption away from healthful high-fat foods (like nuts) and towards processed refined products (like ""low-fat"" cakes), promoting -- as opposed to preventing -- increases in obesity and related diseases.Focusing on calories (or fat) or any other food component that is not whole food misses the whole point. The calories in any given food are not what matters. What matters is how many calories people consume overall throughout the day, and the health implications of the various foods consumed. Certainly, calories count. But consumers should not be counting calories. They should be eating foods that make better control of their calorie intake more possible -- unconsciously. They should be eating less of highly-processed items (like white cake... and white bread and sugary drinks and snack chips) and eating more whole foods (like walnuts... and fruits and vegetables and whole grains). Calorie-focused thinking may have already exacerbated the epidemics of obesity and related diseases. This type of thinking has NOT put us on a path towards slimmer waists or better health. We should not be trying to cut calories from available foods, we should be improving the quality of the foods available that provide our calories. Above all, we should be promoting foods (i.e., real whole foods) that do not prompt us to overeat, fatten, and sicken.Healthy eating is about overall food quality, not food calories. That will be my message for Epicure. That's my message for the world."
