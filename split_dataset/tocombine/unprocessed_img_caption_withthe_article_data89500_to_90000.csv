Case in point: Near the railroad tracks on Atlanta's Westside, artist Karen Schwartz paints in her studio. Through the open window, the sound of birds wafts into the space along with shafts of sunlight. When I meet Schwartz for an interview in April, she is preparing for a one-woman show in Brooklyn, New York, and her nearly-finished work surrounds us. Expressionist yet contemporary, the figurative paintings are dark and deliberate, with a sense of humor and a fluidity marked by bats, bunnies and other animal references that flutter, bounce and stomp through her canvases. Schwartz says it required a lot of deep digging to do the ""physical and visceral"" work of self-discovery that these emotive paintings transmit.A native New Yorker who headed South to earn a doctorate in psychology, Schwartz, a practicing psychotherapist, began to fully realize her artistic talent when she attended the Fine Arts Atelier at the King Plow Arts Center. Here she met fellow New York transplant, Michael David, a prominent painter who became her teacher and mentor. David teaches in Atlanta and is also the curator for Life on Mars Gallery in Bushwick, a neighborhood in Brooklyn that's exploding with art spaces of every size and kind.Schwartz's show, titled ""Down the Rabbit Hole,"" opened at Life on Mars April 24 and runs through May 31. Although it's not specifically dedicated to the memory of her mother, who passed away while Schwartz worked on the series of paintings, the collection displays an element of feminism disguised as motherhood - that of her mother and her own. Schwartz admits it was difficult to fly the ATL-LGA route several times per month to be with her mother during her last year. Yet, the cacophony of Manhattan faded each time she stepped into her Atlanta studio. ""There's something freeing about getting out of the center of the action. I think painters have always done this,"" Schwartz says.""It's stimulating to capture something with your mind and then to be alone with it somewhere else.""The heartache was not erased by the miles nor the Southern train whistle on the nearby tracks, however. The result of the months of back-and-forth travel influenced a show that is full of vibrant hues, edgy lines and vigorous motion punctuated by resolute stillness and sadness. The red lipstick that dances across the mouth of ""Pink Lady,"" a portrait in Schwartz's show, says it all: in life and in art, it's easy to paint on a smile to mask the layers of emotions underneath. What's more difficult is to convey the nuances as brilliantly as Schwartz has done in her work.It's fitting that the exhibition is up during Mother's Day; last year Life On Mars hung a group show called Motherlove, which also featured Schwartz's work, along with paintings by Joan Snyder and quilt artists Mary Lee Bendolph and Loretta P. Bennett. This year, the theme of celebrating women artists continues: the gallery continues its nod to ""The Women of Ab-Ex"" with a May 20 symposium featuring art scholar Eleanor Heartney; Norman Kleeblatt, chief curator of The Jewish Museum; art historian/author Irving Sandler; and critic Phyllis Tuchman.)For more information, visit Lifeonmarsgallery.com.

The Conservative Party surged to a seemingly commanding lead in Britain's parliamentary General Election, with Prime Minister David Cameron remaining in 10 Downing Street.(AP Photo/Tim Ireland)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f7422100005002c96f4b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Watching the UK election from Glasgow and not due back in the U.S. until next week, several thoughts seem worth sending home ahead of us.1. Please remember that this result was entirely unexpected by everyone......including the Conservative political leadership who ended up with a small but working majority. Every major political party here expected that the weekend after the election would be dominated, not by the appointment of Cabinet ministers as is now happening, but by negotiations between political parties, no one of which had a working majority. Rooms were booked in London to hold those negotiations. Negotiating teams were tentatively picked -- teams that included politicians who unexpectedly went down to political defeat on Thursday night. We expected a long night of policy compromise: but no, instead the Tories won, and they were as surprised as the rest of us.2. Why the surprise? Primarily because for months the leading public opinion monitors had forecast a tied election, with Conservative and Labour each only a few support points apart, and with the Liberal Democrats likely again to hold the balance. People south of the Scottish border knew that the SNP might take a few Labour seats in Scotland, but the assumption was that any Scottish losses would be offset by Labour victories in a string of seats that their Conservative opponents won in 2010 only by a tiny margin. The Labour Party might be in crisis now -- but so too is the public opinion industry. When the BBC election coverage opened at 9.55 pm on election night, they shook the entire political class by reporting that their exit poll (data gathered from people after they had voted) indicated that the Conservatives would win the night. Telephone opinion surveys and carefully selected focus groups are clearly no substitute for asking the people who actually vote. The people spoke on Thursday night here, and surprised even themselves!3. So does the result matter? It matters for the UK, but does it matter for the U.S.? The answer has to be ""yes"". It absolutely does: but perhaps not in the short term exactly as the first commentators are suggesting. The support for the SNP in Scotland does not mean that Scottish independence is now inevitable. Scotland is still overwhelmingly a center-left nation, but not necessarily a separatist nationalist one. Two linked but different things happened in Scotland last Thursday. Some Labour Party supporters switched to the SNP because the Nationalists outflanked the Scottish Labour Party on its left. It was the SNP's opposition to the Tory's austerity program that won such votes for them. But the SNP swept Scotland too because new SNP voters came out in droves. South of the border, in England and Wales, the proportion of people voting settled in and around 66 percent. The proportion in Scotland was so much higher. The new voters had been mobilized by the earlier Scottish referendum campaign, and remained involved by the slowness of implementation, and indeed backsliding on, promises made by London politicians to tip the result of the referendum in their way in September.Which means what? It means that Scottish independence remains, for the moment, on the back-burner of politics in the UK, both north and south of the border. The United Kingdom is, for the moment, secure. But how long it remains secure depends on how London's political class handles the rise not just of Scottish nationalism but of its English equivalent. Scottish nationalism is opposed to Conservative austerity. English nationalism represented now by a new political force -- the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) -- is not so opposed. Its concern is with membership of the European Union, and with the freedom of migration across European national boundaries inexorably associated with the European project. UKIP wants the UK to leave the European Union. So do many backbench Tory MPs. In their overwhelming opposition to immigration, they are the UK's equivalent of the Tea Party. There is no appetite for EU withdrawal in Scotland. They are not Tea-Party minded. The English drink a lot of tea. Drinking tea is one of the pleasures of being here. But with deep austerity cuts to come in an emergency budget in June, and with a referendum on EU membership due by 2017, whether the Union is still in place by the time the UK as a whole votes again in 2020 remains an open question. How it is eventually resolved may partly turn on how a deeply shaken Labour Party responds to the contradictory electoral imperatives it now faces: needing to move left to win back votes in Scotland but back to the center to offset the drift of English Labour voters to UKIP. American observers of UK politics would therefore do well to see the U.S. parallels here. The dilemma facing the UK Labour Party is basically the one faced by Democratic presidential candidates as they seek victory in 2016. The dilemma facing the UK Conservative Party is how to hold the UK together while cashing in on anti-European popular sentiment. If either major UK political party fails to find a way through its particular political conundrum, the United States stands poised to lose its most reliable European ally -- the post-imperial United Kingdom.This post originally appeared on www.davidcoates.net."

Though UPS provided its other workers this option when injured or disabled -- or even when they lost their driver's license because of a DUI -- the company said that pregnancy was different. Instead, Young was put on leave without pay and lost her UPS health insurance -- just when she needed it most. So she sued, saying UPS had violated the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. After losing in the courts below, which bought the UPS argument that its policy was ""pregnancy neutral,"" Young appealed to the Supreme Court. Recently, the Supreme Court declined to gut the PDA in the manner sought by employers and advocates for women and families breathed a huge sigh of relief -- but the fact of the matter is that the Court's decision left a lot of uncertainty about the rights of pregnant women and a lot of room for employers to push their luck in denying accommodations to these workers.Today on Mother's Day, we need to confront the truth that the United States doesn't do that well by mothers and consequently by children. It isn't simply that the PDA isn't as strong as it should be; mothers face many obstacles in the American workplace from pregnancy to childbirth and beyond, lacking strong protections against discrimination, access to paid family leave, and affordable, quality child care. One of the biggest challenges for families in America, up and down the income scale, is how to care for children once they are born. Women's participation in the workforce has grown significantly over time, especially that of women with children: almost 77 percent of women with children between six and seventeen are working; 64.2 percent of women whose children are under six are in the workforce, with unmarried mothers having a higher participation rate than married women overall. And while we have taken some small steps to combat discrimination, we haven't done much to address what to do with their children during the workday.In 1993, the U.S. adopted legislation providing unpaid leave for new parents. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) was a big step forward, providing some workers with the right to take twelve weeks of leave for the birth or adoption of a child or other family health care needs. But the FMLA's benefits were limited to a small number of employees. First, the employer needs to provide the leave only if it has at least fifty employees, and, second, the employee must have worked at least 1,250 hours in the previous year. Because of these two limitations, more than 40 percent of private sector workers fail to qualify for FMLA leave. Many ineligible workers work for smaller employers, but others, especially young parents, do not qualify because they have not worked long enough for one employer. As few as 20 percent of new mothers qualify for the benefit. Of young African American workers who are between eighteen and twenty-five with a child under two at home, only 48 percent have enough hours to qualify. Overall, the workers with least access to FMLA leave are those most in need -- younger, low-wage women of color. And since the FMLA provides only unpaid leave, even those mothers who qualify often opt out because they can't afford to lose wages. According to a survey by the Department of Labor in 2012, 46 percent of workers who needed leave were not able to take it because they could not sustain the loss of wages.And after child birth, things get more difficult for working mothers. Our system of child care -- or lack thereof -- fails all families with its high costs, limited availability, and often low quality. But while the failings of the system may affect most parents, they most seriously harm those families that are least able to absorb the extra financial and scheduling burden. Financial hardships from the recent economic downturn have forced many families to use informal arrangements rather than paid child care. Because they simply cannot afford private child care, families with two parents trade off parenting, finding jobs that take them out of the home at different times; others have family members, including their older children, who take over some care responsibilities; others just leave their kids alone and hope nothing goes wrong; and some decide it is better to slide further into poverty than to leave their children without adequate supervision.Those parents who cannot rely on family care may opt for day care centers -- at high cost and of questionable quality. Getting into a child care program is the first challenge. Many families struggle to find a slot for their children, facing a market where demand and supply are clearly not in sync. But shortage of slots isn't the only challenge for poor families to overcome before finding a place for their children. States also set income limits, require copayments, and exclude parents who are in the process of searching for employment but do not yet have a job, or even those who do not work enough hours. Our current hodgepodge of child care subsidies and low-income supports is structured so that incremental increases in earnings can actually drop a family over the ""cliff"" and cost them eligibility.Further complicating access to child care is that low-wage workers tend to work in the types of jobs that make good parenting especially hard: they work night shifts or weekends, they have no ability to leave work for emergencies, let alone school events or parent-teacher meetings, and they don't get any benefits from their employers, like sick leave or paid vacation. The number of women and children affected is huge. For example, among restaurant workers, whose hours are very unpredictable, 2 million of the 5 million workers have children, and half of those are single mothers with kids under eighteen. Home care workers, who are nearly all women, face a similar struggle to care for their own children when they have to care for patients in the evening or on weekends. Perversely, the increase in part-time workers has made it harder for low-income parents to find care for their children, with so many of those workers working a second job or subject to on-call scheduling with erratic hours.Even when a child can get a placement in a child care program or prekindergarten, few facilities provide adequate care. They rarely have enough adults to care for the number of children in the center or have staff with sufficient training -- sometimes the ""teachers"" lack even a high school degree. During World War II, policy makers provided child care facilities for the children of women working in war industries; our military continues this tradition by offering personnel affordable quality child care. In the rapidly changing demographics of the United States, we will either have children in larger numbers left to ""self-care,"" with all the negative consequences, or we can admit that women are working in very high percentages and that they have children -- and more and more of those women are the sole caregiver and not earning enough for private child care. The unfortunate truth about motherhood in America is that it is one of the causes of lingering inequality between men's and women's wages. But public policy can make a real difference. Let's give Mother's Day more than lip service. It is time we strengthened protections against pregnancy discrimination, enacted paid family leave, and ensure all children have access to quality, affordable child care. Our future depends on it.Fredrickson is author of Under The Bus: How Working Women Are Being Run Over."

To give you an idea, the index used to measure how unequal the distribution of income is -- the ""Gini Coefficient"" -- was invented a century ago. So, why the sudden interest? Why worry now about something that has been the fodder of academics, politicians, and the media for so long?",2015-05-10,"France's influential economist Thomas Piketty, author of the bestseller 'Capital in the 21st Century' addresses a keynote speech during a symposium Les Entretiens du Tresor at the Economy Ministry in Paris on January 23, 2015. AFP PHOTO / ERIC PIERMONT (Photo credit should read ERIC PIERMONT/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f7291f00000002257e81.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The publication in 2014 of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century brought inequality to the center of the public policy debate. Looking at lots of historical data, he finds that the return on capital is always higher than economic growth. That means that those who own capital will do better than the rest. The rich will not just get richer, but they will also get richer than everyone else. In capitalism, if governments do nothing, wealth is bound to concentrate among the few.This argument has attracted many followers. Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate, has just published The Great Divide, a kind of application of Piketty to the United States. (Disclaimer: when Stiglitz presented his book last April in Washington, I chaired the event.) But there are also many would-be debunkers -- one of them has shown that wealth does not concentrate as much if you take housing out of the data. For most economists, all this is puzzling -- the study of inequality has been going on forever. To give you an idea, the index used to measure how unequal the distribution of income is -- the ""Gini Coefficient"" -- was invented a century ago. So, why the sudden interest? Why worry now about something that has been the fodder of academics, politicians and the media for so long? Here are four likely reasons: First, we still don't know how much inequality we should live with. While most people detest extreme inequality, most people also detest extreme equality. No one likes to hear that the world's richest one percent will soon be wealthier than the rest of us put together -- yes, it is that bad. But no one really wants to see governments forcing us to own or earn the same whatever our efforts or talents are. How equal should societies be? Economics provides only part of the answer. Research shows that countries where inequality is rampant tend to grow more slowly in the long-run, and to recover more slowly after a recession. And we suspect that there is a direct link between large income differences and political instability, civil conflict, populism, and criminality -- none of which is costless. But economists cannot settle what is, in essence, a matter of social choice. At least in democracies, voters can choose how much inequality they are willing to tolerate by picking a leader that represents their views. The problem, as Stiglitz will rightly tell you, is that inequality can ruin democracy itself: the rich elite just captures the politicians. Ergo: Social policy rarely reflects social preferences.Second, we may be worrying about the wrong problem. The current debate is about inequality of outcomes among adults, that is, how much wealth, income, land, or education each of them should get. In that, there is no agreement. But there is agreement about inequality of opportunity among children -- there should be none. A child's success in life should not depend on her birthplace, gender, race, family's worth, or any other personal circumstance over which she has no control or responsibility. This is held true across the political spectrum -- for the left as a matter of social justice, and for the right as a matter of individual merit. Unfortunately, it was not until 2008 that the first ""Human Opportunity Index"" was constructed and published, applied to Latin-America -- a region where inequality is rife. Few countries currently use it to guide social policy and public expenditures -- Colombia has been a leader in this. That will change over time.Third, we are focusing on radical rather than practical solutions. Piketty suggests a global tax on capital -- wherever your wealth sits, it would be taxed at the same rate. Good idea in theory. But, if taxes are difficult to agree on inside a single country, how likely is an agreement among the 196 countries of the world? Stiglitz and others propose free public services for all -- things like healthcare, college education, and transport. Taken literally, this would only make inequality worse because it would take money away from programs that could benefit the poor -- imagine spending scarce public dollars on paying for rich kids to get a university degree. In fact, the opposite may be better -- governments should focus more of their spending on those in need and away from the well-off. Take fuel subsidies. In the average developing country, two-thirds of gasoline subsidies go to the rich -- they have the cars -- and only three percent go to the poor -- they rely on public transport, where it exists. Something similar happens with electricity and natural gas -- who owns the larger houses? This is a fiscal aberration that can be corrected. The technology to identify and transfer money to the poor -- and only to the poor -- exists and is cheap. What is lacking is political will.Finally, we may be perpetuating inequality with our own behaviors. There is growing evidence that, in increasing numbers, people marry people like themselves. This ""sorting"" is based mostly on education -- think of Ivy-leaguers marrying only other Ivy-leaguers, and high-school drop-outs marrying only high-school drop-outs. The educated choose the educated, and so do their kids. Contacts, jobs and assets then get trapped into classes. Serious scholars have found that, if marriages had occurred at random across educational levels, the distribution of household income in the U.S. today would not be much different from what it was in the 1960s, that is, before the ""Great Divide"" opened up. For now, most of the research comes from developed countries, but the findings probably resonate if you live in Africa, South Asia, or Latin-America. Can governments change our social attitudes? Not easy. Perhaps our newly-found obsession with inequality is a reflection of a collective sense of guilt."

Yes, that is an actual thing Snoop Dogg actually said about a TV show with dragons and frozen zombies.But then again, author George R.R. Martin has said his books are heavily influenced by history, and the Red Wedding and even The Mountain vs. The Viper fight were historically based. So Snoop isn't that far off.""Game of Thrones"" airs on Sundays at 9:00 p.m. ET on HBO."

However, when it came to celebrating the Victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany in May 1945, the Presidents of Russia and the United States came together. Russia set Victory day as May 9th. Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin jointly marked the 50th Victory Day on May 9, 1995, despite America's reservation about Yeltsin's war in Chechnya. Ten years later (2005), George W. Bush was in Moscow next to Vladimir Putin, despite Russia's criticism of America's invasion of Iraq. However, this year, Barack Obama will NOT be attending the Victory Day celebration, even though this year's 70th anniversary is probably the last big celebration for many of the surviving WWII veterans. Obama is not the only world leader who declined to attend in protest of Russia's policies in Ukraine. Of the 68 leaders invited to Moscow, more than half declined the invitation. Of course, Russia's president will not be alone: many European leaders will attend including Czech, Cyprus, Hungary, Slovakia and Greece among others outside the EU such as the heads of China, Brazil and India. The Secretary General of the U.N. will be there. But that hardly makes up for the fact that no single leader of the three nations who fought the Nazis shoulder to shoulder with Russia - the United States, Britain, and France - will join its former ally. Even German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be missing the celebration but be there the next day May 10 to honor Russia since Germany has always been sensitive about its deep gratitude to the Russian people for their pivotal role in defeating Hitler. Obama and other western leaders are still concerned over the seizure of the Crimea in March 2014 and Moscow's subsequent meddling in Eastern Ukraine. Merkel is coming the next day to celebrate the WWII Victory for that reason. Yet Mr. Putin was thrown out of the G-8, and Russia became a subject of unprecedented economic sanctions. In most Western capitals, it has become politically untenable to make any conciliatory gestures towards Mr. Putin. The standoff between Russia and the West now has dragged into its second year, and it has turned into a geopolitical game of chicken with increasingly dangerous geopolitical consequences.

Far from it. On May 9, Russia's new weapons will roll through Red Square, including its new T-14 tank (pictured on the right during the Victory Parade rehearsal). Sukhoi's new stealth fighter jets will fly overhead. The parade will no doubt produce a wave of patriotic enthusiasm and should lift the approval ratings for Putin's policies both domestically and abroad. The USA and other western nations are not the only world powers today. The Kremlin has not been shy about using the images and language that evoke memories of the Great Patriotic War. In fact, for Mr. Putin to get more support, he is taking a tough stance against Ukraine, saying that Russia is fighting against efforts to revive Nazi ideology in Europe.The West dismisses Russia's description of the Ukrainian crisis as ""propaganda."" The fact is that propaganda is only one side of an issue. There are other sides known as data, facts and public policies. Besides, Russia is hardly alone in its effort to deploy historic memories for its present political aim, occasionally rewriting history in the process. Politicians in Ukraine, Poland or the Baltics have been doing the same thing. Ukraine recently passed a controversial ""decommunisation"" law, and gave public recognition to WWII militias implicated in Nazi atrocities against Polish people (Volyn tragedy). In Poland, the foreign minister recently amused historians by claiming that the Auschwitz was liberated by Ukrainians (Auschwitz controversy) Poland is even staging its own Victory Day parade in the town of Gdansk, where the first shots of the WWII were fired. Then in Lithuania, the government recently distributed a brochure to its citizens with instructions on how to conduct oneself in case of a Russian invasion that states: ""Stay rational and don't panic. Shooting outside your windows does not mean the end of the world."" It is hardly surprising that politicians in Moscow, Kiev and other capitals have resorted to heated rhetoric involving war-time language, such as ""fascism"". Today fascism and its modern equivalent (that is the dominance and control of economies and governments by a few extremely wealthy people and companies) is growing in France, USA, UK and even Germany as well as other nations. The memories of the fascist impact and then WWII remain vivid and powerful across Europe, and recalling those notions whips up powerful emotions that blunt people's ability for rational analysis. As Noam Chomsky noted , the whole point of good propaganda is to stop people thinking about the issues (Noam Chomsky Media Control: The Spectacular Achievements of Propaganda, 2002). In short, propaganda exists strongly in the western nations in what they call, ""news"". Hence when the mass media reports ""news"", it is often based on their point of view --- in short propaganda. The other side and angles are rarely reviewed. Today in the USA, there is more and more of this ""false news"" is reported, but in reality, it is only propaganda.Both Kiev and Moscow need a good dose of ""propaganda"" to help their citizens forget the extent to which their respective government's policies failed. In short, they need to report the ""breaking news"" as the western nations do. The Ukraine, instead of reforming its economy, fighting corruption or developing a green economy that would reduce its reliance on Russian gas, has been spending blood and treasure on its civil war in Eastern Ukraine. Russia has hardly been a winner either: its currency devalued by half, interest rates reached 20%, and the direct costs of the Crimea have publicized by Prime Minister Medvedev's own admission, at 25 billion Euros. Most Western countries also suffered damage from the closing of the Russian market. The sanctions that the West implemented against Russia a year ago generated plenty of economic pain, but failed to prevent escalation of the crisis.Both Russia and Ukraine have scored partial news or propaganda victories: Mr. Putin's approval ratings exceed 80% domestically, while Mr. Poroshenko continues to enjoy laudatory coverage from the Western press. A recent Economist article condemned the Kremlin for cynically exploiting the memory of the second world war while praising Ukraine's decision to adapt a new wartime remembrance symbol, which turned out to be... the British crimson poppy.MATTER OF ETHICAL PRINCIPLEThose European and American politicians who continue to support sanctions against Russia say that this is not about the economy, but about principles. Russia violated international norms of conduct, and unless the West teaches Russia a harsh lesson, the entire post-WWII global order is in danger. The principled Western powers state that they cannot accept that. In fact, some politicians in Brussels recently announced that Russia will face further sanctions unless the Crimea is restored to Ukraine. The Ukrainian president recently asserted that Russia and Ukraine will only be at peace when Ukraine recovers Crimea. When asked how long it could take, Mr. Poroshenko pointed to the conflict between North and South Korea as a ""model."" The fact is that all of this conflict is over basic philosophical and economic perspectives that separate the western nations today.This is a vast exaggeration of the European borders issue and the significance of the Crimea. It would be good to remember the during the post-Cold War period, European borders were changed quite a few times. The entire state of Yugoslavia had been carved up, Czechoslovakia was split into two independent countries, while Eastern and Western Germany merged into one country. The process was not entirely peaceful or voluntary: in 1999, NATO planes bombed the Yugoslavian capital. And Ukraine and Russia themselves emerged as independent states by carving themselves out of the Soviet Union. responsible politician would condone Russia's seizure of the Crimea. Yet Russia has already been punished enough. Perhaps a wise way to resolve the standoff would be by allowing Russia to keep the Crimea on the condition that it hold an internationally monitored referendum on whether the Crimeans want to stay with Russia or come back to Ukraine. It would also be useful to keep in mind that the Crimea, in the end, is not that significant. It accounts for only 5% of Ukrainian territory, and, unlike Eastern Ukraine, the Crimea houses no critical industries. It makes no rational sense for Ukraine to hold on to the Crimea at all costs, which is what Mr. Poroshenko seems to be firmly set on. In fact, the net economic and political effect of the transfer of the Crimea to Russia was mildly positive: the peninsula had been a drag on the Ukrainian budget, and its population had always historically supported pro-Russian candidates. So, it is not the loss of the Crimea that damaged Ukraine, but everything else that occurred after that.   Finally, it is worthwhile to recall when and how this all started. On February 27, 1954, the New York Times ran a small article reporting on the transfer of the Crimea to Ukraine, noting in the subsequent analysis that the symbolic nature of the transfer resulted in ""little practical changes."" Perhaps the West should go back to that characterization of the Crimea as an internal Russian-Ukrainian matter. Let's consider the change of Crimea's ownership as a psychologically important, but as a practically insignificant event. In fact, it can even be viewed as a positive sign that Ukraine is finally freeing itself from the vestiges of its Soviet past, of which Crimea was one. By overcoming the obsession with one patch of land, perhaps the leaders of the West, Ukraine, and Russia can address what appears to be a real threat to global order: the loss of common ground among the former Allies that was so obvious during the May 9 Victory day parade. The bottom line is the economies of all these nations. And that is what we will address next: ""connecting the dots."""

So, it is not the loss of the Crimea that damaged Ukraine, but everything else that occurred after that.   Finally, it is worthwhile to recall when and how this all started. On February 27, 1954, the New York Times ran a small article reporting on the transfer of the Crimea to Ukraine, noting in the subsequent analysis that the symbolic nature of the transfer resulted in ""little practical changes."" Perhaps the West should go back to that characterization of the Crimea as an internal Russian-Ukrainian matter. Let's consider the change of Crimea's ownership as a psychologically important, but as a practically insignificant event. In fact, it can even be viewed as a positive sign that Ukraine is finally freeing itself from the vestiges of its Soviet past, of which Crimea was one. By overcoming the obsession with one patch of land, perhaps the leaders of the West, Ukraine, and Russia can address what appears to be a real threat to global order: the loss of common ground among the former Allies that was so obvious during the May 9 Victory day parade. The bottom line is the economies of all these nations. And that is what we will address next: ""connecting the dots."""

Emergence, a cross-disciplinary theory which deals with the way that higher-order complexity can arise out of chaos, presented a powerful new model for aesthetics. For Pearce, a figurative artist and one of the founders of The Representational Art Conference, emergence opened a dynamic alternative to what he feels have been the reductive and culturally erosive tendencies of Postmodernism in art: Complexity and emergence offer an explanation for the positive experience of the art object, and fills the gap critiqued by Adorno as the great failing of aesthetic writing -- that there is no metanarrative in a world in which idealism has been crushed.Art in the Age of Emergence Hardcover: 195 pages Published by Cambridge Scholars Publishing (January 1, 2015)Serious discussions about emergence have been appearing in other fields since the postwar era, especially in physics, chemistry and biology. For example, in biology, emergence has been used to explain properties of life forms that go beyond explanation and transcend their component parts. In the words of one postwar biologist: ""Life itself is an emergent property."" More recently, In the field of theology, Philip Clayton has taken an interdisciplinary approach to emergence, and posited that emergence suggests a new approach to the problem of consciousness, which is neither reducible to brain states nor proof of a mental substance or soul. In his book, Mind and Emergence: From Quantum to Consciousness, he advocates emergentist panentheism and a Christian constructive theology consistent with the new sciences of emergence.Michael Pearce's book is first major effort to use emergence as a model for aesthetic theory. Like Clayton, Pearce takes an interdisciplinary approach, weaving together quotes and observations by archaeologists, art historians, evolutionary biologists, philosophers, physicists, semioticians, and theologians. Partly a personal meditation, but also an exploration of scientific and philosophical ideas, Art in the Age of Emergence is intended to challenge the current orthodoxies of contemporary aesthetics.In the book's first chapter, for example, Pearce argues for a new ""authenticity"" in works of art, which he feels is an antidote to the capitalist excesses of the contemporary art market. Pearce writes:The desire for authenticity is antithetical to the money dominated postmodern art world, in which those who purchase art are manipulated by cynical artists and dealers who exploit socialist pretensions but luxuriate in the benefits of a rampant, unregulated free market capitalism.Pearce's idealism will strike many readers as being gloriously out of touch: something which he would likely take as a compliment. As well-stocked as his book may be with elegant theories and interdisciplinary overlaps, Pearce is nearly alone among serious art writers in his taste and orientation. One of the book's insistences--that representational art is a favored manifestation of emergence--seemed worth questioning. I asked Pearce: ""Why do you feel that Emergence works so well in relation to representational art? Wouldn't it work for abstraction too?""Yes, it does. Emergent aesthetics support both abstraction and representation. But abstraction is only a part of the whole, not a theme that is superior to representation. To think that abstraction is superior to it is an idea that comes straight out of Kant, who thought that we could somehow detach ourselves from emotional responses to art and view it with ""disinterested interest"", with an analytical approach that distanced the work from the viewer. Art in the Age of Emergence is a dense book that is ultimately quite optimistic, and a genuine conversation-starter. In its postscript, Pearce states that ""We are moving beyond the negative impact upon human consciousness caused by the first half of the twentieth century... We all know what an emergent experiences feels like: it is a moment of harmony, of wonder, of completion, felt both as a deep affirmative feeling of unity and as a physiological experience that takes place in the brain."" For Pearce's ideas to be validated his friends and admirers are going to have to make works of art that live up to his very high expectations. For the time being, Pearce is perhaps the only serious art writer in America who offers toasts to Bouguereau and looks to theology for ideas about aesthetics. He is already at work on another book which will deal with emergence and kitsch. For now, his ideas and enthusiasms mark Pearce as decidedly contrarian. Or course, in the art world taste can shift very suddenly and unpredictably. If things move in the direction Pearce feels they will, he will likely see it as a manifestation of emergence, something he noticed before everyone else caught on."

The birth of the electronic era has changed how music is heard and experienced. From orchestra to band to DJ, the technological age has made it possible for one person to create powerful music that once required a team. Now, though an unlikely pairing, even video games are joining the music world.The AG Drive iOS game opened in 73 countries and is currently the number 1 racing game in the US, number 6 action game and number 28 game in the US overall. This compilation soundtrack of AG Drive includes a full buffet of EDM flavors. With electronica, house, acid house, trance, alternative dance, 8 bit and video game scores, the AG Drive Soundtrack is truly an innovative approach to electronic music.Another shining facet that makes this soundtrack unique is that the entire album is comprised of Finnish artists. Every musician on this record has a strong background in the Finnish EDM demoscene and uses wholly original revenue models. Ari Pulkkinen who produced the tracks ""Drive,"" ""Electric Mayhem,"" and ""Ride Me Love Me,"" is known for composing the theme song for the popular game Angry Birds. Fun fact! He has also composed music for award-winning games such as Resogun, Trine series, Dead Nation and Super Stardust HD. Now Ari has started his own AriTunes Records, a premium game music label with goals to create hit music through games. Ari Pulkkinen says music is ""the biggest emotional aspect of any game."" A perfect conduit for the high-octane and pulsating genre of EDM. The AG Drive Soundtrack is being released on the up and coming AriTunes Records.The other artists featured on the album include Burt Kane, Jonne Valtonen, Domestic Machine Movement, Little Bitchard, Tommy Baynen, City Cat, and Tommi Salomaa. All of the Finnish producers on this soundtrack either have a background in video game music production, electronic music production, DJing, or all of the above. Some, like Jonne Valtonen, are even classically trained musicians. Valtonen has written orchestral pieces, electronic music, game scores, and even theater music. A well rounded musician indeed.Combining the video game and music industry is a unique way to reach new listeners. Since the inception of video games, their iconic soundtracks have become ingrained in the memory of popular culture. Games like Super Mario Bros, Zelda and Tetris have scores that became legendary and have even been covered by bands and remixed by producers. Even the Grand Theft Auto franchise is utilizing modern music, featuring underground artists such as Flying Lotus. Creating a record label that boasts music through video games is the natural next step.The AG Drive Soundtrack is paving the way for a new style of music. Just like EDM changed how music is heard, so now does the world of video games. Permeating the minds of gamers who are not only listening to the music but living the music is an ingenious way to be heard. Together, these Finnish musicians are joining their minds as pieces of a puzzle to a bigger picture. The exciting and pulsating soundtrack of AG Drive is sure to garner much deserved attention.Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/aritunes/sets/ag-drive-soundtrack Website: www.aritunesrecords.com Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aripulkkinen.aritunes Twitter: https://twitter.com/aripulkkinen"

Jesse Jackson addresses the crowd during the second ""Million Mom March"" at the Capitol in Washington Sunday, May 9, 2004. Several thousand people gathered at the Capitol to urge renewal of a federal ban on assault weapons. (AP Photo/Adele Starr)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6917ca230000cb15de0a62.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Exactly 15 years ago, I helped organize a 60-member St. Louis delegation sponsored by my synagogue, Congregation Temple Israel, attending the historic Million Mom March in Washington D.C. on Mothers Day, 2000. We were all ages -- from grade schoolers to retirees.Many of us had spent hours the year before watching on television the aftermath of the Columbine High School mass shooting in May 1999. Again we watched in horror months later as preschoolers were led holding hands across the parking lot of the Granada Hills Jewish Community Day Care Center after another unimaginable shooting.Every major Jewish organization and numerous synagogues across the country said ""enough"". Enough with senseless gun violence which was out of control in cities in every state. Losing 10 children a day in 2000 to gun violence was unacceptable.The march, inspired by a New York mother, Donna Dees-Thomases, galvanized gun violence survivors, parents, physicians, law enforcement, clergy, celebrities and elected officials including President Bill Clinton, aiming for 10,000. However that Mothers Day, over 750,000 people from almost every state (including several countries) showed up at the Capitol, accompanied by those rallying in 70 other cities on the same day. Over 1 million people on May 14, 2000 demanded Congress do something about gun violence and at least, extend the expiring national assault weapons ban.Caravans of busses arrived from New Orleans, Detroit and Chicago and the subway exits were mobbed. Inner city parents, emergency room physicians and Robert F. Kennedy's daughters were among those who spoke of loss. Hundreds of thousands of us were told to go back home to our states and determinedly work to pass policies to save lives. A week before the Million Mom March, our daughter Sophie, then a first grader, wrote to Rosie O'Donnell and went on her show to talk about guns in schools. It was surreal to see our 7 year old on national television speak out more bravely than most of us. She highlighted the fear that she and other kids live with concerning gun violence.And today? Even more surreal, in the past 15 years the rate of gun violence has continued to explode, particularly in my own metropolitan area. Eight children continue to be shot every day in the United States. Twenty innocent first graders and six educators were gunned down in their elementary school yet Congress turned a blind eye and did absolutely nothing. Over 100 school and university shootings have happened since that Sandy Hook tragedy on December 2012 and continue each month drawing little publicity. In Missouri, gun deaths have outpaced automobile deaths three years in a row. St. Louis and Kansas City rank among the top 10 cities in the U. S. in gun murders. We recoiled as an anti-semitic madman opened fire last spring at the Kansas City Jewish Community Center killing four. More recently in St. Louis, two young sisters were shot and killed in a vacant lot by an unknown assailant but I guarantee most didn't hear about it. And that was just one of the shootings that occurred that particular day in my state.Voters last August amended the Missouri constitution giving felons more gun rights, hamstringing prosecutors and allowing criminals back on the street. Our legislature debates each session how to increase firearm access, including this year expanding our ""Castle Doctrine/shoot to kill"" law while bills expanding background checks and removing guns from domestic abusers are completely ignored.Most people remain numb to the daily media reports of gun deaths because either a) it takes higher numbers of fatalities to affect us or b) we've succumbed to the gun lobby influence or c) we believe it doesn't affect our neighborhoods... yet. There is absolutely no appetite by the GOP majority party leadership in my state capital to prevent more violence. They blame lack of jobs, extreme poverty, inadequate schools while pushing ""gun rights"" talking points and the NRA's agenda to increase gun profit. They answer to those who insist President Obama will take away their guns although that has yet to happen.As a mother, I felt optimistic 15 years ago that we could stop the horror of burying our children before their time. Yet today it's easy to despair that nothing will change as few in my legislature even bother to stand up to debate for those who are slaughtered by guns. I cannot accept this. I cannot stand by and let survivors do the tireless work in order to prevent the rest of us from unimaginable pain. That is why I work with like-minded legislators in every state through the American State Legislators for Gun Violence Prevention organization, along with mayors, police chiefs and prosecutors in my own state who believe as I do. I refuse to be silent as more mothers and fathers join that awful ""club of grief"". We are responsible. We cannot allow the gun lobby to continue to flood our streets with unlimited firearms and ammunition. We can no longer stay home on election day and relinquish our voices producing obominable voter turnout. We cannot accept complacency when the actual power to save lives rests with ourselves. I am encouraged and am working with the new Washington University of St. Louis Institute of Public Health's gun violence prevention initiative, which was inspired by a mother, Risa Zwerling, wife of Chancellor Mark Wrighton. And I am newly motivated as I met more last week in the ""mother's grief club"" as I attended the annual national Brady Campaign's event last week in Los Angeles, this year honoring Donna Dees-Thomases and the 15th anniversary of the Million Mom March. These survivor activist mothers do not know how to quit. I beg you to help me demand that our elected officials not be bought or silenced by the gun lobby. We cannot sacrifice any more.I am positive on this Mother's Day that we can collectively finally make saving lives a real priority. It is long overdue."

Yes, I think about my mother, who is 93. She is quite elderly and in need of protection in all her frailty in a nursing home, just 3 minutes from my home. I recollect our long relationship and understand its limitations. My role now is to make her safe and comfortable, and to forgive her.As a pediatrician, I have met thousands of mothers. Abroad, working with my foundation, Worldwide Orphans, I have met countless poor mothers, and always hoped that their sweetness would be rewarded with the kindness and support they needed to be able to love their children and not be forced to give them up.As an adoption doctor working with families adopting in the U.S., I am especially reminded this weekend of how lonely and desperate birth mothers end up being at the moment their babies are born. I work hard to help parents befriend their birth mother as they make their way through this very painful adoption plan. I dare to request that the adoptive parents search for her goodness and thoughts, to transfer this to the child they adopt. The judgments made of birth mothers are cruel and callous for sure. Many birth mothers are using drugs, drinking and self-medicating with medications, and adoptive parents are anxious about the future of their child so they bypass the relationship with the birth mother. But how can we bypass such a precious, formative relationship?I am a mother of two teenage sons, and I wonder about my own worth on this day. I am often not so eager to celebrate it. It seems false in so many ways. I don't ask my children for cards or flowers... on any occasion actually. I just want to be with them, because it is another day closer to when they will be gone and on their own. Only a few short years left of me insisting on them showering and brushing their teeth. I will take anything I can get just to be near their smelly bodies and to listen to their wildly illogical opinions. I will be quiet when I would like to scream because one or both is not doing what I think they should.I pray that I can be just distant enough yet close enough for them to feel my undying devotion until my last breath on this planet earth. How lucky are we who live and intimately associate with our kids, while so many mothers have lost their children -- or never had them at all -- for whatever crazy reasons in an irrational, chaotic, and unjust world?Dr. Jane Aronson is CEO & President, Worldwide Orphans Foundation."

There would be no need for one more attack to the rim, however. The hard part was over. Williams' last play with the ball did not result in points on the board, but rather just a smile and a fist pump. The Santa Cruz Warriors were champions, but Williams' journey is far from over.""No matter what level it's on, to win a championship, especially to do it with good guys and teammates that you kind of grew with, is special,"" said Williams.Williams averaged 27 points 4 rebounds and 6.5 assists in the Warriors' two championship games, good enough to take home Finals MVP.It wasn't too long ago, however, many wondered if Williams would ever play professional basketball again.Coming out of Memphis, Williams was dubbed the ""Next Penny Hardaway."" A transcendent talent, the 6'5 combo guard committed to play at Duke as one of the best prep hoopsters in the country. Hardships soon closed in on him and his stay in Durham was short lived. His mom was diagnosed with cancer and Williams transferred to the University of Memphis to be close to her.While at Memphis, Williams' mom would get better and his game began to thrive. The Portland Trailblazers drafted him in the first round, but the elation was fleeting.Before Williams could play his first game he dislocated his right patella sidelining him for the entire season. A few months later he had surgery on his left knee.He was able to come back the next season, only to injure his shoulder, ending his year prematurely.Three surgeries in two years are usually enough to make someone question a career change. Williams didn't have that chance; the next year during team workouts he tore his Achilles. Another season. Another missed opportunity.For Williams, though, it never was an issue.""You got to stay positive about everything. It's tough sitting down watching other people play; it had to do a lot with patience.""You try and sit back and be positive about it by watching and studying the game, watching a lot of film, just different things I can pick up. I just tried to make it a positive.""There's a popular bible verse that many use when adversity hits from 1 Corinthians 10:13, ""But God is faithful, and He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can handle.""For many this verse is thrust upon them as a sign of hope, that this too will pass. For Williams, he was tested far beyond the measures of what the mind can fathom. While rehabilitating his Achilles, an injury that ends careers and derails others, his mom died due to complications from cancer.""That was the toughest blow for me. That's a situation where it's hard to come out of. You lose that one person, forget basketball, forget that, I lost my mother. That's something, initially, I was hurt bad.""Through the darkness of not playing the game he loved and losing the most important person in his life, Williams was still able to reach for the light we all grasp when things hit rock bottom.""I had to take a step back, stop thinking about basketball, and get my mind together. One of the first things my mom loved [was] basketball and it kept me saying 'I can play, and I know she's watching.'""I play through her.""Williams has spent the last two seasons injury free. While last season was spent with the Philadelphia 76ers, this year he has been playing professional basketball's version of limbo. He has spent some time with the Utah Jazz, New Orleans Pelicans and Charlotte Hornets, totaling 50 days in the NBA.Even though he was unable to find a long-term contract, the positive perspective he gained from his mother's death has been his driving force while excelling in the NBA's Developmental League.""I was able to play a lot of point guard, that's something I couldn't work on in the NBA. That's one of those things that takes a lot of time. I never got a chance to do that so that was big for me to get a lot time there and I know I've become a better player in the D-League.""Now that the season is over, Williams has had time to reflect. Mother's Day is just a week away, releasing a flood of emotions, both good and bad.""Those times are tough, for the most part. Now I learn to appreciate it more than being mad.""I know my mom is watching over me. I have the memory of when I got drafted of her and me crying together. That's one of those things you never forget. That's the dream of every basketball player to have that happen. To share that with my mom, that was big for me.""The only thing left on Williams' list is to get back to the NBA on a permanent basis. He knows from a lifetime of experiences, however, that some things are out of your control.""The older you get the more you understand, you can't really stress about what you can't control. All I can do is focus on myself, work hard and put myself in position and be ready.""Readiness can only get you so far. Being ready can't prepare you for significant injuries or the death of a loved one. Williams' greatest attribute might not be the ability to be ready, but rather the capacity to overcome overwhelming obstacles that many of us can't imagine let alone defeat.For Williams, the act of being ready might be as simple as a smile and fist pump.----By Wai Sallas, Sports Editor, Good Men Project SportsOriginally published in The Good Men Project.Photo Credit: Rick Bowmer/AP"

This is the 16th post in the Young and Entrepreneurial Series. To read previous features and to stay up to date with future features, like our Facebook page here. ---I was researching about student startup incubators when I came across Posmetrics Founder and CEO Merrill Lutsky while browsing through the list of student partners at Rough Draft Ventures, an investment fund that invests in student startups in the Boston area. I quickly read Merrill's profile and was impressed by how he started Posmetrics, a Y Combinator-backed startup that built iPad-based customer feedback solutions for retailers, restaurants and hospitality. After going through Y Combinator's Winter 2013 startup class and raising $510k in seed funding, Posmetrics would get acquired by Revinate in the summer of 2013. Merrill is currently finishing his Senior Year in Harvard University and will be working in Square, where he has been working as a Product Consultant for almost two years now while finishing his degree in Applied Math.How did Merrill's entrepreneurship all begin?   Growing up in Northfield Minnesota, Merrill never really thought about becoming an entrepreneur. The whole idea of starting a company was completely foreign to him. His first exposure to the startup world and entrepreneurship scene would be the ""Social Network"" movie. Before he knew it, Merrill would be at the center of it all, getting a taste of what it's like to run a startup as a student. Everything started with an open ended final project for the Introduction to Computer Science course Merrill took his first semester at Harvard. His team decided to build a rating system for the dining halls at Harvard. He explained, ""We wanted to tell what was good and what was bad. As you exited, you could give a quick rating that we could pull and collate. There was an API that could pull the menus that we wrote. We just wrote this thing to display the main dishes and sliding scales for you to tell us how much you liked it.""Merrill and his team would eventually realize that this could be generalized to users and different types of businesses like restaurants and retail stores. Merrill explained, ""We kind of realized that we could probably solve this information problem of collecting data and feedback. If you think about it form the end user perspective, we could make it a lot easier by collecting a lot more data in real time while people are still in the experience.""HackHarvard Program  Merrill and his team would join the HackHarvard program, a one-week program that took student projects and taught students how to start a company based on the idea they had. It was through this program that Merrill learned how to take his CS class project and turn it into something scalable. ""We got to visit a bunch of different Venture Capital Offices and Boston Area Starts and met founders there. It was a really cool introduction to the Boston Startup Community.""Through this experience, Merrill and his team were forced to validate their idea by talking to potential customers and getting their feedback. This kind of validation helped Merrill and his team start thinking about their project as a startup business. The spring semester would come and Merrill's team would apply and go on to win the i3 Innovation Challenge. They would ride this momentum and attract an alumni investor who became their first investor and gave them initial capital to turn Posmetrics to something they could work on during the summer. Merrill added, ""The summer after we started was the time we shifted from a project to a full fledged company. We were building a lot of cool stuff but it didn't become apparent to us how hard it was to turn this into a full fledged business and get somebody to pay for our product. It was hell a lot harder. It was a good reality check for us. We had to starting thinking about it as a business.""Applying to Y Combinator  After working full time on it during the summer, Posmetrics was able to expand their reach quite a bit. This was when Merrill and his team decided to apply to Y Combinator (YC). Merrill shared, ""Applying to YC was very much a matter of reaching out to advisors and talking to people who had been through it before. A lot of people helped us on what YC was looking for and how to tailor the application and figure out all the components that go into a solid YC application.""Merrill and his team saw Y Combinator as a good support structure and network that would allow them to drop out of school for a while because running Posmetrics with a full course load was getting harder and harder for them. With the right amount of traction, reaching out, research and a dedicated team, Posmetrics was able to make it to Y Combinator. Merrill shared, ""As soon as we got there, we realized that there's no secret sauce. Obviously the advisers and partners are extremely knowledgeable but at the end of the day, it was the three of us waking up at 6am to call customers and staying up until 3am to fix the bugs in the site and doing it all over again. There's sort of like this romantic notion of starting a company. But it wasn't the case. A lot of it was hard work.""Merrill added, ""YC was just a good way to focus on growing really fast and developing the product the way we should've been. It really is just the focus and intensity and having the weekly dinners and what not. It just creates an urgency that I never really felt in any other context. It was the greatest advantage of YC.""Getting Acquired  After Y Combinator, Posmetrics would get approached by this company called Revinate that served a lot more hotels worldwide. Merrill shared, ""It was a natural fit for us to grow our reach and achieve the vision we had not initially setup. One of the things we learned was that it was going to be a 5-10 year process for us to get to a scale where the data we would be collecting would be interesting to analyze.""It started out as a partnership but eventually turned into an acquisition. Merrill and his team would end up working with the company for a few months to make sure the product worked seamlessly. Then Merrill would decide to move on and join Square before deciding to go back to school. He shared, ""One thing was I think I realize was that I didn't really know what I wanted to do next. So I thought about the place where I could be in the best position to set myself up for something in the future--I went back to the Harvard community. I wanted to be around everyone who I had started college with--the people who I had discussions with and who had started the path with us.""Merrill would go back to Harvard and get the opportunity once again get exposed to as many fields of knowledge and ideas as possible.

They had this belief that with enough persistence and intelligence, they could do anything.

By sharing the stories of these individuals, I hope to inspire youth from all over the world to follow their passions, to take the road less travelled and to disrupt the status quo. This is the 16th post in the Young and Entrepreneurial Series. To read previous features and to stay up to date with future features, like our Facebook page here. ---I was researching about student startup incubators when I came across Posmetrics Founder and CEO Merrill Lutsky while browsing through the list of student partners at Rough Draft Ventures, an investment fund that invests in student startups in the Boston area. I quickly read Merrill's profile and was impressed by how he started Posmetrics, a Y Combinator-backed startup that built iPad-based customer feedback solutions for retailers, restaurants and hospitality. After going through Y Combinator's Winter 2013 startup class and raising $510k in seed funding, Posmetrics would get acquired by Revinate in the summer of 2013. Merrill is currently finishing his Senior Year in Harvard University and will be working in Square, where he has been working as a Product Consultant for almost two years now while finishing his degree in Applied Math.How did Merrill's entrepreneurship all begin?   Growing up in Northfield Minnesota, Merrill never really thought about becoming an entrepreneur. The whole idea of starting a company was completely foreign to him. His first exposure to the startup world and entrepreneurship scene would be the ""Social Network"" movie. Before he knew it, Merrill would be at the center of it all, getting a taste of what it's like to run a startup as a student. Everything started with an open ended final project for the Introduction to Computer Science course Merrill took his first semester at Harvard. His team decided to build a rating system for the dining halls at Harvard. He explained, ""We wanted to tell what was good and what was bad. As you exited, you could give a quick rating that we could pull and collate. There was an API that could pull the menus that we wrote. We just wrote this thing to display the main dishes and sliding scales for you to tell us how much you liked it.""Merrill and his team would eventually realize that this could be generalized to users and different types of businesses like restaurants and retail stores. Merrill explained, ""We kind of realized that we could probably solve this information problem of collecting data and feedback. If you think about it form the end user perspective, we could make it a lot easier by collecting a lot more data in real time while people are still in the experience.""HackHarvard Program  Merrill and his team would join the HackHarvard program, a one-week program that took student projects and taught students how to start a company based on the idea they had. It was through this program that Merrill learned how to take his CS class project and turn it into something scalable. ""We got to visit a bunch of different Venture Capital Offices and Boston Area Starts and met founders there. It was a really cool introduction to the Boston Startup Community.""Through this experience, Merrill and his team were forced to validate their idea by talking to potential customers and getting their feedback. This kind of validation helped Merrill and his team start thinking about their project as a startup business. The spring semester would come and Merrill's team would apply and go on to win the i3 Innovation Challenge. They would ride this momentum and attract an alumni investor who became their first investor and gave them initial capital to turn Posmetrics to something they could work on during the summer. Merrill added, ""The summer after we started was the time we shifted from a project to a full fledged company. We were building a lot of cool stuff but it didn't become apparent to us how hard it was to turn this into a full fledged business and get somebody to pay for our product. It was hell a lot harder. It was a good reality check for us. We had to starting thinking about it as a business.""Applying to Y Combinator  After working full time on it during the summer, Posmetrics was able to expand their reach quite a bit. This was when Merrill and his team decided to apply to Y Combinator (YC). Merrill shared, ""Applying to YC was very much a matter of reaching out to advisors and talking to people who had been through it before. A lot of people helped us on what YC was looking for and how to tailor the application and figure out all the components that go into a solid YC application.""Merrill and his team saw Y Combinator as a good support structure and network that would allow them to drop out of school for a while because running Posmetrics with a full course load was getting harder and harder for them. With the right amount of traction, reaching out, research and a dedicated team, Posmetrics was able to make it to Y Combinator. Merrill shared, ""As soon as we got there, we realized that there's no secret sauce. Obviously the advisers and partners are extremely knowledgeable but at the end of the day, it was the three of us waking up at 6am to call customers and staying up until 3am to fix the bugs in the site and doing it all over again. There's sort of like this romantic notion of starting a company. But it wasn't the case. A lot of it was hard work.""Merrill added, ""YC was just a good way to focus on growing really fast and developing the product the way we should've been. It really is just the focus and intensity and having the weekly dinners and what not. It just creates an urgency that I never really felt in any other context. It was the greatest advantage of YC.""Getting Acquired  After Y Combinator, Posmetrics would get approached by this company called Revinate that served a lot more hotels worldwide. Merrill shared, ""It was a natural fit for us to grow our reach and achieve the vision we had not initially setup. One of the things we learned was that it was going to be a 5-10 year process for us to get to a scale where the data we would be collecting would be interesting to analyze.""It started out as a partnership but eventually turned into an acquisition. Merrill and his team would end up working with the company for a few months to make sure the product worked seamlessly. Then Merrill would decide to move on and join Square before deciding to go back to school. He shared, ""One thing was I think I realize was that I didn't really know what I wanted to do next. So I thought about the place where I could be in the best position to set myself up for something in the future--I went back to the Harvard community.

The Pentagon's response follows:Dear Senator Cruz:Thank you for your inquiry into whether the Jade Helm 15 military exercise is the first wave of a federal takeover of Texas, the Trojan Horse, as it were, of the end of sovereignty in the Lone Star State. Our response, contrary to the long tradition of official correspondence and military bureaucracy, is concise: no. But that's just what you would expect us to say, isn't it?Perhaps, then, you would prefer not an official proclamation but a reasoned answer. As a master debater in college (Princeton, right?), you surely appreciate the reliability of logic, your public statements over the past few years notwithstanding. If you are disinclined to take the United States Armed Forces at their word when we promise no ill intentions towards Texas, then perhaps your considerable and vaunted intellectual powers, which once posited the regrowth of hymens as a guard against unauthorized incursions in domestic affairs, could be swayed by incontrovertible fact.I know you think highly of our capabilities. Why else would you advocate for a short war with Iran? If we are indeed that powerful, we could probably launch an attack from any of the 15 U.S. military bases already within Texas' borders. While Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher may have found it necessary, even attractive, to invade countries that can easily be overrun, the present DoD considers such lopsided contests at best unsporting. As someone who was not born within the borders of this country, it might interest you to know that Texas is already part of the United States. In fact, Texas has twice joined the Union. The first time your adopted state joined the USA in 1845 it set in motion events that led to the Mexican-American War. Later, when Union troops conquered the Southern rebellion, Texas rejoined the Union. It is not, therefore, farfetched to think that Texas' relationship to the rest of the United States could involve war, but please also keep in mind that when we refer to the United States of America, Texas is being implicitly included. We thought about calling it the United States of America and Texas, but we were afraid people might think Texas was a retrograde backwater of reactionary lunatics who think Moses was a Founding Father and laugh at you. This is way better.Please also consider there are a great many things about Texas and Texan culture that could be threatened by another unnecessary armed conflict between Texas and the United States. We like Texas barbecue. That Green Beret who carried the flag out for the Texas Longhorn football team? That was pretty cool. The wildflowers along the highways are no joke. The late Texan Chris Kyle, the ""American sniper,"" is a hero to many. Texas gave the world Lyndon Johnson, a staggering gift for which America was perhaps not entirely prepared. Without the Lone Star State, the Western swing band Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys would have appeared under the performing name Robert Wills and His Playboys, which is ghastly, or not have existed at all, a possibility that DoD has officially classified as ""too awful to contemplate"". And we really dig the self-awareness, the love of self that, while occasionally metastasizing into paranoid delusions such as those that motivated your original query, also make Texas a culture with an indelible sense of place. But, we reiterate, that place is in the United States. On previous visits, we noticed that many of your residents enjoy Social Security and Medicare (you're welcome), volunteer for the armed services, treasure federal parks, wildlife preserves, and wilderness areas, and earn and spend currency backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. With a quick Internet search, I also learned that nearly a third of Texas' total revenue is from Federal funding. In fact, millions of your schoolchildren pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America almost every day. And unlike yourself, they apparently mean it.There is a fundamental misapprehension that we feel is at the root of your query about our intentions was revealed in a recent comment you made to the press.We are assured it is a military training exercise. I have no reason to doubt those assurances, but I understand the reason for concern and uncertainty, because when the federal government has not demonstrated itself to be trustworthy in this administration, the natural consequence is that many citizens don't trust what it is saying.If, Senator Cruz, you believe that the United States military is a political tool of its civilian leadership, you have reached a conclusion unsupported by fact, history and good sense. The troops swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States. To besmirch their loyalty to the country, even in the service of making hackneyed political points in the Republican primary, does not make you a patriot, but a partisan. Even a Princeton and Harvard Law man should know the difference.Also, it makes you the rudest Canadian we've ever run across.Sincerely Yours,Secretary Ashton CarterNote: This is not actually a letter from the Secretary of Defense and is, in fact, the work of those under whose bylines it ran. Secretary Carter is much funnier. "

A Reuters reporter saw residents returning after dark, scurrying to their homes through streets stained with blood. At least eight houses were damaged beyond repair, flames still licking the roof of one.""It's total destruction. Thank God we're safe,"" said Haki Ukshini, his home reduced to a brick shell shorn of roof and windows.Police said the gunmen had been plotting to attack civilian and state targets this month, just as a political crisis rocking the government threatens to climax in an opposition rally called for May 17.Explosions and automatic gunfire rattled Kumanovo through Saturday and into Sunday, recalling the clashes of 2001.Then, NATO brokered a peace deal and some of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas entered government. But tensions remain, fueled by poverty, isolation and the glacial pace of integration with the West.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called for calm and a ""transparent investigation to establish what happened.""Conservative Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, whose nine-year hold on power has been threatened by allegations of illegal wire-tapping and abuse of power leveled by opposition leader Zoran Zaev, suggested some of those killed or arrested in Kumanovo had fought ""in the Middle East.""  FRUSTRATIONS""This is not a Macedonian-Albanian conflict, but a conflict between people who mean no good to the state and people who uphold the state,"" he said in a live televised address after police declared the operation over.Dozens of people were arrested, some of them taken to court handcuffed and in white jump-suits.An estimated 30 percent of Macedonia's 2 million people are ethnic Albanians. In Kumanovo, they poured scorn on the official version of events.""This is pure manipulation,"" said 40-year-old Elham Murad, an unemployed Albanian man who had fled his home in the besieged suburb. He said he had seen nothing unusual in the days leading up to the police operation, except for a drone aircraft flying above the town the day before.""This is a stunt by Gruevski to cover up Zaev's revelations,"" he said. Asked if he would attend the May 17 protest, Murad replied: ""I'll go, dead or alive.""Ambassadors of the United States, European Union, OSCE and NATO issued a joint statement saying they hoped the drama would prompt leaders ""to pull together and engage in dialog on all issues facing the country, including the protracted political crisis.""Macedonia's bid to join NATO and the EU, seen in the Balkans as a promise of jobs, prosperity and freedom of movement, is blocked by a long-running dispute with Greece over the country's name.An Interior Ministry spokesman, Ivo Kotevski, said 37 police officers had been wounded in the clashes, and did not rule out that the death toll might rise. Two were buried in the western region of Tetovo, their coffins draped in the Macedonian flag and escorted by uniformed colleagues.

According to McGurk, 22,000 foreign fighters have traveled to Iraq and Syria to fight alongside the Islamic State. About 3,700 of these fighters are from Western nations, he said. “This is a multifaceted, international, federal, state and local challenge,” he explained. McGurk is the deputy head of a coalition of 62 nations committed to defeating the Islamic State. While the coalition is primarily focused on reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria, there is also an effort to disrupt the group’s finance networks and counter its social media messaging campaign in order to limit the group’s ability to attract recruits. Most of the territorial gains have been in Iraq, McGurk conceded. However, last week marked the beginning of the Pentagon-led effort to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State there. The U.S. is currently vetting about 3,400 volunteers and hopes to have 5,000 troops trained within a year, McGurk said. While the U.S. will provide opposition fighters with air support against the Islamic State, there is no plan to provide trainees protection from attacks by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. U.N.-led talks, aimed at reaching a political agreement to end the four-year-old civil war in Syria, restarted last week. McGurk said he hoped that the increased capabilities of the opposition fighters would force Assad to make concessions in this round of talks. Entering the ninth month of the U.S.-led bombing campaign against the Islamic State, Congress has yet to pass a war authorization. The Obama administration has claimed the 2001 authorization, passed in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, provides sufficient legal authority for the war. Last week, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told The Huffington Post that Congress’ failure to act “[has] demonstrated that we’re indifferent or lack a backbone.” "

If the law is on your side, pound the law. If neither is on your side, pound the other lawyer."" The facts are definitely not on the President's side. For two decades the trade deals negotiated by the last three presidents have lowered U.S. wages, lost jobs and generated a chronic trade deficit that requires our country to borrow more money every year in order to pay for imports. The president's main argument that exports have risen, without mentioning that imports have risen much faster, is now transparently deceitful to anyone who can add and subtract.Neither is the law in his corner. As did his predecessors, Bill Clinton and George Bush, he assures Americans that this deal will be different because, you see, it will protect workers. But the secret draft, which had to be revealed to Americans by Wikileaks, shows that once again a trade agreement will be used to enhance the power of multinational corporate investors over people who have to work for a living. As AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka pointed out recently, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which is charged with negotiating and enforcing the deal, does not even believe that murder and other brutal acts committed against labor union activists violate the ""worker-protection"" clauses to trade agreements.So, like a lawyer trained to defend the indefensible, Obama is desperately pounding the opposition. They are ""just wrong,"" he says, without showing us why. He accuses them of ""making stuff up"" -- that is, that they are liars. He whines that they are ""whupping on me."" He charges, nonsensically, that they ""want to pull up the drawbridge and isolate themselves."" But it is Barack Obama who is isolating himself -- from the facts, from the law and from people who have loyally supported him against the vicious personal attacks from the reactionary Right. Showing a streak of in-your-face contempt for them, he gave Friday's speech at the corporate headquarters of Nike -- a notorious outsourcer of American jobs. Democrats ask why he is doing this. Why has he chosen to invest so much of his dwindling political capital to push a project that even its promoters acknowledge can deliver at best only marginal benefits?We cannot read the President's mind. But this unholy alliance with Republicans and their outsourcing corporate clients smells like a desperate effort to add something, anything, to his rather thin two-term legacy. One thing is certain: If his shameful pounding of dissenters to the TPP is successful, the result will be to further pulverize the living standards of American workers."

Strawberry MuffinsLoaded with sweet strawberries, these tender muffins with crisp, golden tops are perfect for a special breakfast or brunch.

Double Chocolate BiscottiBiscotti are twice-baked cookies made intentionally dry and crunch for dunking into coffee or tea, and these are made with a double dose of chocolate. When you dunk them, they soften -- becoming rich, chocolaty and decadent. GET THE RECIPE 6.

My own children have been fairly hit or miss in recognizing the day: from breakfasts in bed that, while not always edible, were priceless in their adorable orchestration, to thoughtful cards and gestures, to forgetting the day all together. As I get older, the misses mean much less, the hits so much more. But it hasn't been in my role as mother that I've felt the lump in my throat and the knot in my gut; it's in my role as a daughter. Until one month ago, I never knew why.My mother has been dead for three years now. She died of Huntington's Disease on New Year's Eve 2011. At the time I was relieved to see her suffering end, but this Mother's Day, I find myself grappling with much more complex feelings, and a sense of relief in knowing that I won't have to celebrate this day with her. Perhaps that last line just shocked you? I can see how it might. But then, you probably have a mother you love. I've shocked you again.One month ago, I learned the truth about my mother. I'm a 52-year-old woman and I feel like I'm just waking up. It hasn't been easy; in fact the past few weeks have been truly brutal at times -- but they have also been freeing. I have long acknowledged that much of my childhood was painful and challenging. My mother was a broken woman long before Huntington's claimed her. I feel enormous compassion for the abuse she suffered as a child, and the hardships she faced throughout her life -- even the ones she brought upon herself. Life is much harder when you start out with as many scars as she had. As her daughter and as another woman, I have always felt a great sadness for her. I did my best to forgive many things and before she died, I know she felt that. I loved her, in my own broken way.However, she was not a good mother, and from that brokenness she inflicted many of the same hardships on me (I won't speak for my siblings). I generally write honestly, without filters: I must filter this. The truth I learned serves no one else reading this, but my journey has lessons that are worth sharing. I blocked the truth out, something that has been almost as dizzying as the truths I'm now digesting. As children, we do that sometimes when reality simply hurts too much. However, hearing the truth for the first time I felt both horror ... and then a peace descend on me, knowing that all those years, that knot in my gut was there for a reason.  Mom loved being a GrammyMom struggled in her role as mother, and while I'm still grieving the loss of stories I clung to to make things less painful, I also feel a deep sense of relief in knowing that I wasn't crazy all those times I felt lost and confused. The struggle wasn't about me; I just believe that, because I was too young to know any better. My husband has gently pointed out that she did change later in life; she was a good grandmother; she did her best. I know he's right. I've always understood that fact, but it feels bitter in my mouth right now. I reserve the right to feel what I feel right now, and work on forgiveness.I was loved deeply by others, and that is the memory I've recovered. It was there all along, but I was afraid to believe in it, because my mother's stories never pointed me in that direction. I believed whatever story fit, to avoid feeling abandoned. While others cringe that a child who has been horribly assaulted would still want to be with the offending parent, I've always understood that desperate need to fix it and hope things get better. I clung too. *For the record: I was not assaulted by my parents, but the role of trauma in my childhood served the same end.After my father died in car accident, when I was ten and a half, I had very little contact with his family: my grandmother, great-grandmother, two aunts (his sisters) and countless great aunts, cousins, etc. -- all of whom had been an integral part of my early childhood, prior to my mother taking me and my siblings back east, without my father's permission or knowledge. Our world was suddenly filled with new aunts and uncles, new relatives, who we hadn't known before, having grown up far away. They loved us; there were happy times with there as well. Over the years I tried to bury the hurt I felt in losing my other family. I believed my father had let us go; I believed he didn't really want us, and over time I came to believe that those aunts and uncles, grandparents and cousins, all found other children to love. I imagined they had moved on, and we were not worth the effort. I was not worth the effort.   (My Aunt, my great-grandmother, my grandmother... they loved me) My father loved us, and he lost us.The reality was very different, and after high school, my paternal aunts and great grandmother reached out to me, and sent me an airline ticket to visit them. By then, my father and grandmother were dead, and I'd grown up with another family who I loved. I saw my dad's family as strangers who I wanted to know, but who I felt guarded with and unsure of. It was a wonderful summer, and we all made more effort over the years to reconnect -- but in the back of my mind, my mother's stories kept me from fully embracing their love; I remained wary and careful, protective of my mother, who had long told me reasons to feel that way. I remained a scared kid, afraid to anger or push her away, by embracing this other family. I stayed in touch with them, but there was always the invisible wall I'd built, that kept me from being closer to them.  When we moved to Washington State, 15 years ago, I began to forge a stronger relationship with my father's sister, my aunt Cokie -- who lives only two hours from us. By then my mother was ill with Huntington's and we were all careful in what we said about the past, building new ties and bonds. I thrived in my aunt's affection; my children adored her, often telling me that she was like another grandmother -- one who took them hunting for beach treasures, made cookies with them, and beamed every time they were with her. I have loved her for all the same reasons, but my child's heart held just a bit of that old wariness and fear that I'd betray my mother, or alienate my aunt. Having grown up with fear and anxiety -- always afraid I'd alienate my mother; I assumed that's how it worked with everyone.My aunt, however, has taught me that love doesn't hurt. Over and over she has shown me that no matter what I do, whether she agrees with me or doesn't, one thing is constant: she loves me. In learning a painful truth, a month ago, I also learned that that her love and the love of all those relatives who lost us, was always there. They held it in a safe place, just been waiting for me to let my guard down and fully accept it. When the wall came down, I felt free to finally acknowledge my mother's love was something that held me back. It came with conditions and toxic edges. I exhaled deeply when I realized that somewhere inside, I'd always known there was another love ... and that I was deserving of it. My aunt Cokie has become the matriarch of our family. She will blush when she reads that. I make her laugh with bold assertions and my unfiltered way of saying things. I love her laughter; I bask in its glow. She is a doting grandmother to her five grandchildren; she adores them. She is close with both of her children, my cousins. We all have our issues with our parents, nothing is perfect -- but from a distance, I always knew that my cousins were very lucky. My aunt has also embraced me and my kids, my sister and her daughter, and my brother's children. She and her sister, my aunt Pat, have been a vital connection to my father. My aunt has let us know that we are loved, with no strings and no judgment. She is the kind of mother I wish I was and wish I had, but I'm grateful she's my aunt. I aspire to be that kind of aunt to my nieces and nephews.In my darkest time, five years ago, when I believed I couldn't cope anymore, she was the one who pulled me up, and told me: ""You are from strong stock."" Those words have made all the difference. They are my daily mantra. They are the words I want my own children to know. Not everyone grows up with the kind of mother that Hallmark celebrates. I have spent a lifetime struggling to pick out the right card -- knowing it doesn't really exist. There are countless people who have struggled with these same feelings, many having had much harder lives than me. But if we are open, there are other mothers among us. They come in the form of friends, in the form of grandmothers, sisters ... and aunts. A month ago, my aunts Cokie and Pat, circled the wagons and finally freed my scarred and wary heart. They let me know that I am and always have been loved. They reminded me that for all the loss and pain they are still here, and we are from strong stock. To Aunt Pat and Aunt Cokie, who I love very much, Happy Mother's Day!If you enjoyed this post, please hit the thumbs up icon at the top, or hit like.
