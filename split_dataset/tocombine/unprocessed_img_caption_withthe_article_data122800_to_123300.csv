But that's been banished, along with George Washington's cherry tree.",2014-04-21,"WILLIAMSBURG, VA - APRIL 18: Tourists board the Susan Constant for a taste of colonial era seamanship at Jamestown Settlement during a visit for our travel story on April, 18, 2013 in Williamsburg, VA. (Photo by Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dfd22240000510053cd97.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you think Colonial Williamsburg is the Republican Disneyland, you haven't been there in a while. The nation's largest living history center near Newport News, Va., once had that reputation in the way it depicted the American Revolution: white men waving flags and guns. But that's been banished, along with George Washington's cherry tree. Now, visitors can hear from slaves debating whether to take up the offer to fight for the British and gain their freedom. They can quiz Patrick Henry on why he thought the Constitution was a bad idea, or listen to the complaints of Native Americans.But if you've read any of the bestselling books on the period, like Joseph Ellis' Founding Brothers or Jon Meacham's Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power, you know that once the Founders are taken off the pedestal and dusted off, their story becomes even more compelling. The noble vision implemented by imperfect people makes their achievements all the more astounding.One comes away from a visit to Williamsburg even more appreciative of the freedoms we take for granted. Patriotism is not something the Tea Party should have a monopoly on. But would you want to take your family there on a vacation? For those of us who don't remember much from school about American history and whose kids find the Revolution irrelevant to their problems, the answer is that this is the best way to bring that period alive.Colonial Williamsburg is the restored 301 acres of what was Virginia's capital during the turbulent period from 1699 to 1780 (when it was moved to Richmond). It is close to Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement, and Yorktown, where the Americans finally defeated the British. All three can be seen in four days and the big surprise is that they're all exciting places to learn for the whole family.As experienced travelers know, half the success of a trip comes from good preparation. Read The Official Guide to America's Historic Triangle and go through The American Revolution for Kids by Janis Herbert together. Also, watch the early episodes of the outstanding documentary America: The Story of Us (adults should also watch Terrence Malick's The New World for a vivid retelling of the Jamestown story). At www.colonialwilliamsburg.org you can look at the schedule of special events for the time you want to visit.We asked about the best bed-and-breakfast in the area and everyone referred us to Cedars of Williamsburg, the oldest in the area, famous for its hospitality and located in a quiet area a short walk from the historic district.Take the shuttle once you arrive to the Visitors Center and start with the overview film. Also, browse the terrific bookstore, where you can read the dust jackets of books about American history to get an idea of what you may have been missing (better than trying to search online).The Center is where your kids -- and perhaps you -- can start playing RevQuest, a clever three-hour game that takes participants across the historic district as spies for the Revolution (in case you haven't heard, AMC's hot new TV series Turn is about George Washington's spy ring).There are lots of opportunities to travel back in time along the Duke of Gloucester Street, where dozens of buildings are open to learn how the mentally ill were treated, how food was prepared without modern conveniences, or how the courts tried to deliver justice.The street bursts with activity from 2:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. each day, as actors put on mini-plays in the street and on stages, interacting with visitors as they recruit for the revolutionary army, debate the news, or discuss their hardships, making the challenges resonate for today. ]In the evening, there is everything from candlelight tours of haunted houses to lessons in colonial dancing.Colonial Williamsburg's motto is ""that the future may learn from the past."" The Founders, warts and all, were willing to sacrifice everything for principles remain inspiring. The central message: citizens need to be informed and active and we can't afford to take our freedoms for granted.Jamestown and YorktownLess than a half hour away from Williamsburg at opposite ends of Colonial Parkway are Jamestown and Yorktown. Inexplicably, the free shuttle between the three sites was recently canceled, so you'll need a car and the closest and cheapest is B&W Rental 800-899-2271 (on weekends it closes at noon, while most places to visit are open until 5, so plan accordingly). We drove one afternoon to the two Jamestowns and you need at least two hours at each. First, we went through the outstanding museum at Jamestown Settlement, where a nonprofit that has recreated the fort that was built after the community was founded in 1607. This allows visitors who really see and understand it (including the role of Pocahontas in saving the life of its leader, Captain John Smith, and providing food to the settlers when they were starving). The original site of the fort is run by the U.S. Park Service, Historic Jamestowne. See the introductory film, the archaeological dig, and the amazing museum (which documents the cannibalism that some turned to).There are also two Yorktowns. You can drive around the Colonial National Historic Park Battlefield's key points before the Visitors Center opens at 9 a.m. Plan to spend an hour inside -- the film gives a good overview of what happened when American and French troops cornered British forces and determined world history. After following the history from Jamestown and Williamsburg, one has to be astounded by the Revolutionaries' belief they could defeat the greatest empire in history.The movie at the Yorktown Victory Center (same web site as Jamestown Settlement) takes a dramatized approached to what life was like for the ordinary American soldier. You will need a couple of hours to go through the excellent museum, which looks at the archaeology done on British ships that were sunk before the battle, while outside there is a Continental Army encampment and period farm.The takeaway is that the roots of today's multicultural and entrepreneurial American culture go back to the beginning, when only those willing to take enormous risks and work with others who were very different sailed for the New World. ""America's Historic Triangle"" is the best package deal for seven days at all five places: $88.50 for adults, $38.75 ages 6-15 (available on the web sites and there are other attractions in the area to fill out a vacation)."

The Apache Relay's newest is among them. More than a long-awaited sequel, it represents a much-needed shift in our obsession with folk music: infusing the soul that's been leaking into pop, bathing it in the tape-y warmth of everything indie, and still managing to connect in a way that feels absolutely unpretentious.It's an impressive feat for a band with just one prior album. The Apache Relay released American Nomad in 2011: 11 tracks that pitched melodic folk-rock by the bale in a style that hit the year square on the nose. They got some acknowledgement for this. The band landed tour dates with Mumford and Sons in 2012; ""Power Hungry Animals"" was featured on the soundtrack of 2013 coming-of-angst film The Way Way Back. But since then they have been largely quiet, working diligently behind the scenes.""[We] probably scrapped a couple albums worth of stuff,"" says guitarist Mike Harris from across the narrow booth. I met the now-five members of the band in a coffee shop late one afternoon in Denver, lined up on laptops at a waist-height bar. We packed into a booth, a few members swirling the last orange dregs of Kombucha in short glasses, sitting in the gold light with listlessness reserved of people waiting for something. For this release, they have certainly been waiting.Keyboardist Kellen Wenrich explains. ""It's been locked up for about a year. We started the recording process in October of 2012."" ""We recorded all the way to May 2013,"" cuts in singer Michael Ford Jr., before Kellen finishes, ""So... it's been a process.""What could make the album take so long? A combination of things. There was the exacting process of working with Producer Kevin Augunas -- a man who ""knows what he's looking for,"" and I get the impression won't settle for anything else. Even after the seven months of fine-tuning and tracking, when the mixing was complete and a record done, the band wasn't satisfied. Instead of releasing it, they tore it apart and had the tracks remixed and remastered. ""It all came with the spirit of intentionality in making this record. We wanted to dot all of our I's and cross our T's before we finished it. We made sure everything felt right before we got it done."" -- Bret MooreWe leave the coffee shop to make the short drive to that night's venue, piling into a tall Mercedes Sprinter with dirty windows; two seats facing backwards in the middle, smudges on the dash, The Apache Relay camo and cowboy-riding-a-raccoon koozies stuffed into the side of the door.I sit at the bar and watch band members shrug off layers, late-winter air creeping in the door and along the carpet. They unload with absent-minded care. There's an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie playing from the wall that separates the bar and stage. ""This movie used to scare the shit out of me when I was a kid,"" cracks Ford Jr., picking up a neat well whisky and heading back to set up.Through the window behind the bar, the duality of The Apache Relay is easy to see. On one hand they are all homespun joy and welcoming; genteel graciousness; southern comfort. I recognize the loose, homecoming feel of American Nomad in every face. But now they move like clockwork, climbing up and down like a circus, clicking into place with practiced ease. That duality is what makes this record sing, from the first track to the last. The sound is controlled and focused, giving the sense that each song could be nothing other than what it is. But at the same time, The Apache Relay constantly strains against the sonic box that they built for themselves. And this feeling -- of fullness barely kept in check -- is what makes the thing so perfect.The opening song, the soul-infused single ""Katie, Queen of Tennessee"" (arguably the tune most under wraps) sounds almost like another band from the one that made American Nomad: electric guitar picking hides with hollywood strings, wall-of-sound sweetness is backed in mellow three-part harmony. But by the second track, ""Ruby,"" the sound starts to open and shake up dust. ""Terrible Feeling"" brings a delightful twinge of pain, opening with the lines, ""Bloody Mary's in the morning / Dead canaries tried to warn me"", and a chorus that ends in ""Standing here on the bridge / Looking over the edge."" It's also the first track where Michael Ford Jr.'s voice really shines for what it is -- the powerhouse that moves the band along, roving melodies lifting songs that might otherwise feel staid. One of the best cuts of the bunch is ""Good as Gold,"" a Spaghetti Western earworm that gives glimpses of the band's last record, bringing all problems of modern to life to bear in tremolo and lonely tambourine. (He watched her pack her bags / She would soon be on her way / Following some rich kid to L.A.)The true pinnacle of The Apache Relay, however, is the beautifully bitter close, ""Happiest Day of Your Life"" -- a lonely, stripped-down ballad that never feels empty in spite of containing only a single voice and guitar. It brings the album to a tragic, echoing end, flexing a new level of lyrical muscle to make the heartbreak real (I stood in the park / Like a photograph until way after dark / In a rented suit holding my homeless heart / In the freezing summer). When it's over, you're left heartsick for the happy beginning -- a feeling that will have listeners starting the album over as soon as they finish it.Back in Denver, the opening act is just finishing their set. The room clears and bodies clot around the bar. Loosely, The Apache Relay come to the stage, members flitting in and out before the light goes plum, bodies flowing into the room at the first tri-part harmony. That afternoon, Michael Ford, Jr. told me where he hoped the band would go in the future. It would be nice just to have a natural progression, to start playing a little bit bigger rooms... honestly just from an acoustical standpoint. A lot of times when you get into venues that are a little bit bigger the acoustics change.Tonight they're playing in a tall, long room where the drums are swallowed by a ceiling with ragged holes. The wall behind the bar is bare plywood. Basically, the space is all wrong. There's too much good to hear -- too much practice, and the stage is their element. For every marvelous turn they make, the band's brilliance is lost in the bed-sheeted walls of a dive bar squatting in a mile-high residential urban neighborhood. This is not where they belong.As soon as their set is finished, the waiting begins again. The band members start doing what they do every night: greet fans, dutifully fold rumpled t-shirts, chat with friends from out of town. But they do it with a joy and freshness, even after six weeks on the road, that says to everyone that this is their element. ""I'd be lying to say this wasn't what I want to do. And I'm thrilled to do this. To play original music in a band like this. I'm so psyched on that, so I try to be a good steward of that and take it seriously."" -- Bret MooreI left feeling like a witness to the start of something not yet realized. A record not yet released, a band ready but waiting to step into lights befitting their skill. For this album, The Apache Relay has worked five years. What happens next will be the stretching, logical conclusion of that work -- quite possibly a landmark for the band and listeners alike. The world is very close to receiving something I'm not sure it knows it wants yet. But it will. The Apache Relay's time has come.The Apache Relay is out April 22nd"

Accessories include teenage human versions of the ponies, plush toys, clothing and books.""With My Little Pony, Hasbro is having tremendous success because they are developing not just physical toys but also content that helps little girls understand storylines and character development,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink said.Mattel has been successful with its American Girl toy range, which comprise chubby-faced dolls portraying 8-11 year-old girls of different ethnicities. They are sold with storybooks from the viewpoint of the dolls.Sales of Hasbro's toys for girls was also helped by strong demand for a bow-and-arrow-based offshoot of its Nerf line of gun toys - the Nerf Rebelle - that cashed in on the popularity of the 'Hunger Games' movie series.The girls' toy business grew to $138.7 million in the first quarter ended March 30 and accounted for 20.4 percent of total revenue, up from 17.3 percent a year earlier.Revenue from boys' toys, the company's largest business category, inched up to $247.8 million. Revenue from both preschool toys and games, which include Monopoly and Pictionary, fell 4 percent.""We're seeing our market share in girls, particularly in dolls, grow in the U.S. and around the world and we're also seeing that growth in outdoor activities where Nerf Rebelle has scored ...,"" Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner said on a post-earnings conference call.Many of Hasbro's action figures are based on partnerships with studio films, which vary in popularity each year.Demand has been weak industrywide for action figures and preschool toys, two important categories for Hasbro, as children shift their focus to mobile devices, analysts have said.However, Wissink said she expects shipments of action figures to accelerate in the second quarter with the release of the new Spider-Man movie in May and the next installment of the Transformers franchise in late June.Hasbro owns the Transformers brand and holds the toy licenses for Marvel Comics' characters, which have had a phenomenal box office run over the last few years, most recently with the success of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". REVENUE MISSESHasbro's first-quarter revenue rose 2 percent to $679.5 million, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $690.17 million.International revenue rose 5 percent to $305.5 million, offsetting a 1 percent decline in sales in North America.Net income was $32.1 million, or 24 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $6.7 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 14 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 10 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Hasbro shares, which have risen 18.9 percent in the 12 months to Thursday's close, were up 0.7 percent at $55.00 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Mattel shares were up 1 percent at $37.85 on Monday.At Thursday's closing price, Hasbro's stock was trading at 16.67 times forward earnings. Mattel's shares were trading at a multiple of 13.75.

They enjoyed them as toddlers and adolescents, but by 12 they had left them behind in favor of Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga.  Now they are 17. As the father of teenage girls, I have spent many hours driving them places while they listen to their favorite songs and singers on the car radio. Most of this music (like Bruno Mars, Imagine Dragons, Jay-Z, Adele, and Pink) strikes me as simplistic or silly -- no doubt just like my parents felt about my favorite songs and singers in the 1960s. Even so, I have discovered that I actually like a few of my daughters' favorite singers, like Mumford & Sons, Ed Sheeran, Civil Wars, and the remarkable (though still little-known) Hudson Taylor. But when I try to sing along, or just move around to the beat, the girls give me that look that means: ""Daddy, don't try to be cool. You're too old."" So I figured that I'd never bond with my daughters over music.   Amelia with her favorite album and her new record player (photo by Terry Meng) But something happened a few months ago that may have turned the tables -- literally. I was cleaning out the shelves in our living room cabinet. That is where my wife and I store our record collection, comprised mostly of 33 rpm vinyl albums from the 60s and 70s. We brought them with us when we moved to Los Angeles over 20 years ago. We hadn't listened to even one of them in all that time, but it was hard to part with them, since, like old letters and high school sports trophies, they connect us to our past.   When we drove from Boston to LA, we depended on tape cassettes, which had replaced vinyl albums, to keep us entertained. Within a few years, though, we'd moved on to the CD stage of history. And just recently, we've become familiar with the strange new world of I-tunes, which allow music-lovers to create their own highly individualized albums instead of buying the pre-packaged versions.   I rarely thought about our collection of more than 200 LPs, but when I did, I assumed that they had become warped and unplayable, and would eventually be thrown in the trash to be recycled into some polluting plastic product. But a few months ago, our daughter Amelia started to look at our LPs and then started asking questions about them, including ""will these still work?""  I told her that the vinyl records had probably warped. And even if they were in mint condition, I pointed out, we didn't own a ""record player"" -- a phrase I hadn't used in years and which, to Amelia, probably sounded like ""typewriter."" But she was curious enough to pick out some albums that caught her fancy and bring them to the house of a friend whose parents did own one of those old-fashioned music-playing machines.   She was hooked, and asked us if we could get her a record player. We did, and for the past few months she's been spending lots of time in her room -- by herself and with her friends -- listening to Simon & Garfunkel, the Beatles, Joni Mitchell, Peter, Paul & Mary, Bob Dylan, and even Procol Harum, whose ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" album cover is one of the most psychedelic ever produced. (I remember the covers of most of my albums as well as I remember the music).   At some point I may ask her to listen to some of my more obscure (but much-loved) albums -- like the McGarrigle Sisters, Nina Simone, Fairport Convention, Laura Nyro, Tim Hardin, Odetta, the Roches, and Richie Havens. But right now I'm enjoying listening to my old favorites and enjoying even more watching Amelia enjoy them.  It is strange to realize that most of these albums are 45 or 50 years old, purchased when I was in high school and college. To Amelia, these are ancient artifacts of an earlier civilization. But they constitute great music and I'm happy to see her appreciating them and asking questions about the artists and their songs, including my own memories. So I've told her about seeing a young Bob Dylan at a Greenwich Village coffee house before he'd released his first album, going to a Peter, Paul and Mary concert in Asbury Park when I was in high school, attending a Simon & Garfunkel concert even before the soundtrack to ""The Graduate"" made them super-famous, and spending nights in my college dorm room with friends trying to figure out what ""I Am A Rock"" meant. She's already heard my stories about every Pete Seeger concert I ever went to, including the Newport Folk Festival.  In today's high-tech world, it is comforting to hear Amelia say that she likes hearing the scratchy quality of the songs on vinyl records, which she considers a marker of authenticity. And Amelia isn't the only teenager who has rediscovered vinyl LPs. She's part of a trend.  Just like video stores, record stores have fallen on hard times. Big chains like Tower and Virgin have gone out of business. But some independent stores have recently gotten a big boost selling both used LPs and re-issued albums. (To appear trendy, even stores like Urban Outfitters sell vinyl records).  Rusty Gordon, co-owner of Canterbury Records in Pasadena (which was started by his father in 1956 and is now one of Amelia's favorite hang-outs) told me that there's always been a demand for vinyl LPs among jazz and rock aficionados, but he noticed a big jump in vinyl sales about five years ago and an ""extra surge"" in the past six months. Five years ago, vinyl records accounted for about 5 percent of his store's sales. Today, new and used vinyl LPs constitute more than 15 percent of Canterbury's sales and the momentum is ""still building,"" Gordon says.  The 6 million vinyl albums sold in the United States last year account for only about 1.4 percent of all album sales, but the number is growing steadily. According to Nielson SoundScan, vinyl album sales increased by 44 percent in 2010, 39 percent in 2011, 19 percent in 2012 and another 32 percent in 2013. Meanwhile, CD sales declined 14.5 percent last year.   Teenagers, Gordon said, make up a big portion of the new consumer market for vinyl records. They mostly buy re-issued classic rock and folk-rock albums (the Beatles, the Doors, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Simon & Garfunkel) and newly-minted albums by indy rock favorites like The Black Keys, Arctic Monkeys, and Mumford & Sons. One of the most popular vinyl re-issues among teenager consumers is the Beatles' ""Abbey Road"" album. (Amelia, however, has the original album, thanks to her dad).  What explains vinyl's new-found popularity among today's teenagers? ""They think it sounds better,"" Gordon told me. ""Plus, it's about as far as you can get from MP3s. They like the artwork on the covers, too.""  Amelia's bonding with my old vinyl albums may be a passing fancy or the beginning of a life-long love affair with this music. And, of course, she hasn't abandoned her contemporary favorites, whom she still listens to on the radio and I-tunes, and whose concerts and other gigs she still attends with her teenage friends. But I do get a special chill up my spine when I hear ""The Sound of Silence"" and ""Blowin' in the Wind"" coming from her room.

(Photo by Walter McBride/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb26ec2210000e700c77c12.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After a challenging 2013, Melissa Errico is a star on the rebound. The stage and screen veteran has a lot to bounce back from, as her run in last year's acclaimed Off-Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim’s “Passion” was cut short due to complications from bronchitis. Meanwhile, the doctor-mandated vocal rest that followed prevented her from joining co-stars Judy Kuhn and Ryan Silverman on that production’s cast album. “It wasn’t just a bump in the road; it was a crushing, heartbreaking bump,” Errico (“Amour,” “Les Misérables”) now says of the experience. “The medical problem itself was small, but the impact of leaving the show was greater. I didn't have a foot on land.” A year later, the 44-year-old singer-actress is back in fighting form, and she's viewing her latest show, “At the Corner of 54th & Crazy,” as an opportunity to “embrace her flops as well as her successes,” with “Passion,” of course, being among them. Errico sings ""Meadowlark"" at Joe's PubThe new act, which opens April 22 at New York’s 54 Below, marks Errico’s return to the venerable Manhattan hotspot since her acclaimed 2012 run (which, incidentally, took place in the wake of Hurricane Sandy). She says that she and her “unstoppable” musical director, Richard Jay-Alexander, have been rehearsing about 40 songs by Sondheim, Frank Wildhorn and Burt Bacharach, among others, in the weeks leading up to the show's debut. Each evening’s performance will be a unique combination of that material. “No Broadway career is complete without disasters, and I’ve certainly had mine,” she quips with a laugh. “I’m very grateful to be singing again -- just grateful. I don’t feel a moment’s hesitation.” As many of Errico’s anecdotes reflect, “At the Corner of 54th & Crazy” is also a peek into the mindset of a working performer juggling the pressures of show business and a young family. Errico sings ""Loving You"" from Sondheim's ""Passion""“People are always saying to me, ‘My God! You juggle everything so beautifully.’ But actually, I don’t,” she says. Still, she credits husband Patrick McEnroe as well as daughters Victoria, 7, and Diana and Juliette, both 5, with “empowering” her as she prepares for the show. “Not only do I have an obligation to myself to re-group, but I have an obligation to them,” she says. “It’s really important to have a different rhythm outside of the ebbs and lows of the profession. In my case, it’s a family tribe. We’re a soul tribe, and there’s so much affection and passion.” And it seems as if at least one of Errico’s daughters could be following Mom’s path to the stage one day. “Juliette started playing the guitar the other day, and she wrote her first song, about how she didn’t know what to wear to school that day, and specifically, how she didn’t know what to wear to parties,” Errico says, adding that like any blossoming songwriter, the youngster knows how to strike a nerve. “She spoke the complete universal truth.” Melissa Errico's ""At The Corner of 54th and Crazy"" plays New York's 54 Below on April 22, 24-26.

James Cartwright cheer on riders during an event to welcome the Wounded Warrior Project's soldier ride to the White House in Washington, Wednesday, May 4, 2011. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c5402200005700dd76ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Cross-posted with TomDispatch.comHow the mighty have fallen. Once known as “Obama’s favorite general,” James Cartwright will soon don a prison uniform and, thanks to a plea deal, spend 13 months behind bars. Involved in setting up the earliest military cyberforce inside U.S. Strategic Command, which he led from 2004 to 2007, Cartwright also played a role in launching the first cyberwar in history -- the release of the Stuxnet virus against Iran’s nuclear program. A Justice Department investigation found that, in 2012, he leaked information on the development of that virus to David Sanger of the New York Times. The result: a front-page piece revealing its existence, and so the American cyber-campaign against Iran, to the American public. It was considered a serious breach of national security. On Thursday, the retired four-star general stood in front of a U.S. district judge who told him that his “criminal act” was ""a very serious one"" and had been “committed by a national security expert who lost his moral compass."" It was a remarkable ending for a man who nearly reached the heights of Pentagon power, was almost appointed chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and had the president’s ear.In fact, Gen. James Cartwright has not gone to jail and the above paragraph remains -- as yet -- a grim Washington fairy tale. There is indeed a Justice Department investigation open against the president’s “favorite general” (as Washington scribe to the stars Bob Woodward once labeled him) for the possible leaking of information on that virus to the New York Times, but that's all. He remains quite active in private life, holding the Harold Brown Chair in Defense Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, as a consultant to ABC News, and on the board of Raytheon, among other things. He has suffered but a single penalty so far: he was stripped of his security clearance.A different leaker actually agreed to that plea deal for the 13-month jail term. Nearly three weeks ago, ex-State Department intelligence analyst Stephen E. Kim pled guilty to “an unauthorized disclosure of national defense information.” He stood before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who offered those stern words of admonition, and took responsibility for passing classified information on the North Korean nuclear program to Fox News reporter James Rosen in 2009. Still, someday Cartwright might prove to be unique in the annals of Obama era jurisprudence -- the only Washington figure of any significance in these years to be given a jail sentence for a crime of state. Whatever happens to him, his ongoing case highlights a singular fact: that there is but one crime for which anyone in America’s national security state can be held accountable in a court of law, and that’s leaking information that might put those in it in a bad light or simply let the American public know something more about what its government is really doing.If this weren't Washington 2014, but rather George Orwell’s novel 1984, then the sign emblazoned on the front of the Ministry of Truth -- “War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength” -- would have to be amended to add a fourth slogan: Knowledge is Crime.  Seven Free Passes for the National Security StateWith Cartwright as a possible exception, the members of the national security state, unlike the rest of us, exist in what might be called “post-legal” America. They know that, no matter how heinous the crime, they will not be brought to justice for it. The list of potentially serious criminal acts for which no one has had to take responsibility in a court of law is long, and never tabulated in one place. Consider this, then, an initial run-down on seven of the most obvious crimes and misdemeanors of this era for which no one has been held accountable.*Kidnapping: After 9/11, the CIA got into kidnapping in a big way. At least 136 “terror suspects” and possibly many more (including completely innocent people) were kidnapped off the streets of global cities, as well as from the backlands of the planet, often with the help of local police or intelligence agencies. Fifty-four other countries were enlisted in the enterprise. The prisoners were delivered either into the Bush administration’s secret global system of prisons, also known as “black sites,” to be detained and mistreated, or they were “rendered” directly into the hands of torturing regimes from Egypt to Uzbekistan. No American involved has been brought to court for such illegal acts (nor did the American government ever offer an apology, no less restitution to anyone it kidnapped, even those who turned out not to be “terror suspects”). One set of CIA agents was, however, indicted in Italy for a kidnapping and rendition to Egypt. Among them was the Agency’s Milan station chief Robert Seldon Lady. He had achieved brief notoriety for overseeing a la dolce vita version of rendition and later fled the country for the United States. Last year, he was briefly taken into custody in Panama, only to be spirited out of that country and back to safety by the U.S. government.*Torture (and other abuses): Similarly, it will be no news to anyone that, in their infamous ""torture memos,"" officials of the Bush Justice Department freed CIA interrogators to “take the gloves off” and use what were euphemistically called “enhanced interrogation techniques” against offshore prisoners in the Global War on Terror. These “techniques” included “waterboarding,” once known as “the water torture,” and long accepted even in this country as a form of torture. On coming to office, President Obama rejected these practices, but refused to prosecute those who practiced them. Not a single CIA agent or private contractor involved was ever charged, no less brought to trial, nor was anyone in the Bush Justice Department or the rest of an administration which green-lighted these practices and whose top officials reportedly saw them demonstrated in the White House.To be accurate, a single member of the national security state has gone to prison thanks to the CIA’s torture program. That was John Kiriakou, a former CIA agent who tortured no one, but offended the Obama administrations by turning whistleblower and going public about Agency torture. He is now serving a 30-month prison sentence “for disclosing a covert operative’s name to a reporter.” In other words, the only crime that could be prosecuted in connection with the Agency's torture campaign was one that threatened to let the American public know more about it.Now, however, thanks to leaks from the embattled Senate Intelligence Committee’s 6,300-page report on the CIA’s interrogation and torture program, we know that the Agency ""used interrogation methods that weren’t approved by the Justice Department or CIA headquarters."" In other words, its agents went beyond even those techniques approved in the torture memos, which in turn means that they acted illegally even by the standards of the Bush administration. This should be an obvious signal for the beginning of prosecutions, but -- not surprisingly -- it looks like the only prosecution on the horizon might be of whoever leaked parts of the unreleased Senate report to McClatchy News.*The destruction of evidence of a crime: To purposely destroy evidence in order to impede a future investigation of possible criminal acts is itself, of course, a crime. We know that such a thing did indeed happen. Jose Rodriguez, Jr., the head of CIA clandestine operations, destroyed 92 videotapes of the repeated waterboardings of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who planned the 9/11 attacks, and alleged al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah, “tapes that he had been explicitly told to preserve as part of an official investigation.” The Justice Department investigated his act, but never charged him. He has since defended himself in a book, Hard Measures, saying that he was, in essence, “tired of waiting for Washington's bureaucracy to make a decision that protected American lives.” He is still free and writing op-eds for the Washington Post defending the interrogation program whose tapes he destroyed.*The planning of an extralegal prison system: As is now well known, a global network of extralegal prisons, or “black sites,"" at which acts of torture and abuse of every sort could be committed was set up at the wishes of the highest officials of the Bush administration. This system was created specifically to avoid putting terror suspects into the U.S. legal system. In that sense, it was by definition extralegal, if not illegal. It represented, that is, a concerted effort to avoid any of the constraints or oversight that U.S. law or the U.S. courts might have imposed on the treatment of detainees. This was a well-planned crime committed not under the rubric of war against any specific power, but of a global war without end against al-Qaeda and like-minded groups.*The killing of detainees in that extralegal system: The deaths of detainees in CIA custody in offshore (or borrowed) prisons as a result of harsh treatment ordered by their Agency handlers was not considered a crime. In two cases -- in the “Salt Pit” in Afghanistan and at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq -- such deaths were investigated by the Justice Department, but no one was ever charged. In the case of Gul Rahman, the prisoner in the Salt Pit, according to the Washington Post, “a CIA officer allegedly ordered Afghan guards in November 2002 to strip Rahman and chain him to the concrete floor of his cell. Temperatures plunged overnight, and Rahman froze to death. Hypothermia was listed as the cause of death and Rahman was buried in an unmarked grave.” (In a rare case brought before a military court, a low-level Army interrogator was convicted of “killing an Iraqi general by stuffing him face-first into a sleeping bag,” and sentenced to “forfeit $6,000 of his salary over the next four months, receive a formal reprimand, and spend 60 days restricted to his home, office, and church.”)*Assassination: Once upon a time, off-the-books assassination was generally a rare act of state and always one that presidents could deny responsibility for. Now, it is part of everyday life in the White House and at the CIA. The president’s role as assassin-in-chief, as the man who quite literally makes the final decision on whom to kill, has been all-but-publicly promoted as a political plus. The drone assassination campaigns in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, though “covert” and run by a civilian agency (with much secret help from the U.S. Air Force) are openly reported on in the media and discussed as a seeming point of pride by those involved. In 2009, for instance, then-CIA Director Leon Panetta didn’t hesitate to enthusiastically praise the drone attacks in Pakistan as “the only game in town.” And best of all, they are “legal.” We know this because the White House had the Justice Department prepare a 50-page document on their legality that it has refused to release to the public. In these campaigns in the backlands of distant places where there are seldom reporters, we nonetheless know that thousands of people have died, including significant numbers of children. Being run by a civilian agency, they cannot in any normal sense be “acts of war.” In another world, they would certainly be considered illegal and possibly war crimes, as Christof Heyns, the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, has suggested. Top officials have taken responsibility for these acts, including the drone killings in Yemen of four American citizens condemned to death by a White House that has enthusiastically taken on the role of judge, jury, and executioner. No one involved, however, will ever see a day in court.*Perjury before Congress: Lying to Congress in public testimony is, of course, perjury. Among others, we know that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper committed it in a strikingly bald-faced way on March 12, 2013. When asked by Senator Ron Wyden whether the NSA had gathered “any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans” -- a question submitted to him a day in advance -- Clapper answered, “No, sir. Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect, but not wittingly.” This was a lie, pure and simple, as the Snowden revelations on the NSA’s gathering of phone metadata on all Americans (including, assumedly, our congressional representatives) would later make clear. Clapper subsequently apologized, saying that he spoke in what he called “the least untruthful” way possible, which, were crime on anyone’s mind, would essentially have been a confession. Congress did nothing. Just in case you wondered, Clapper remains the director of national intelligence with the “support” of the president.Mind you, the above seven categories don’t even take into account the sort of warrantless surveillance of Americans that should have put someone in a court of law, or the ways in which various warrior corporations overbilled or cheated the government in its war zones, or the ways private contractors “ran wild” in those same zones. Even relatively low-level crimes by minor figures in the national security state have normally not been criminalized. Take, for example, the private surveillance of and cyberstalking of “love interests,” or “LOVEINT,” by NSA employees using government surveillance systems. The NSA claims that at least one employee was “disciplined” for this, but no one was taken to court. A rare exception: a number of low level military figures in the Abu Ghraib scandal were tried for their abusive actions, convicted, and sent to jail, though no one higher than a colonel was held accountable in court for those infamously systematic and organized acts of torture and abuse.Too Big to Fail, National Security-StyleAll in all, as with the banks after the meltdown of 2007-2008, even the most obvious of national security state crimes seem to fall into a ""too big to fail”-like category. Call it ""too big to jail."" The only crime that repeatedly makes it out of the investigative phase and into court -- as with Stephen Kim, Chelsea Manning, and John Kiriakou -- is revealing information the national security state holds dear. On that, the Obama administration has been fierce and prosecutorial.Despite the claims of national security breaches in such cases, most of the leakers and whistleblowers of our moment have had little to offer in the way of information that might benefit Washington’s official enemies. What Kim told Fox News about the North Korean nuclear program was hardly likely to have been news to the North Koreans, just as the Iranians are believed to have already known what General Cartwright may have leaked to the Times about the origins of the Stuxnet virus.Of course, leaking is a habit that’s often considered quite useful by those in power. It’s little short of a sport in Washington, done whenever officials feel it to be to their advantage or the advantage of an administration, even if what's at stake are “secret” programs like the CIA’s drone campaign in Pakistan. What’s still up in the air -- and to be tested -- is whether leaking information in the government’s supposed interest could, in fact, be a crime. And that’s where General Cartwright comes in. If there is, in fact, but a single crime that can be committed within the national security state for which our leaders now believe jail time is appropriate, how wide is the category and is knowledge always a crime when it ends up in the wrong brains?If there were one man of power and prominence who might join Kim, Kiriakou, Manning, and Edward Snowden (should the U.S. government ever get its hands on him), it might be Cartwright. It’s a long shot, but here’s what he doesn’t have going for him. He was an insider who was evidently an outsider. He was considered ""a lone wolf"" who went to the president privately, behind the backs of, and to the evident dismay of, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense. He seems to have had few supporters in the Pentagon and to have alienated key Republican senators. He could, in short, prove the single sacrificial lamb in the national security state.In Washington today, knowledge is the only crime. That’s a political reality of the twenty-first century.

While many of my peers disagree strenuously with me, for every benefit of touring I can list a countervailing cost. It is clear that when an ensemble tours the artists draw closer together, benefit from having new audiences view the work and new critics assess the quality, and come back home refreshed and excited. I also know that bringing donors to enjoy the artists they support in another setting and watching audiences cheer for them can make them more engaged and more generous. I have seen Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in Japan, American Ballet Theatre in London, the Royal Ballet in Beijing and the National Symphony Orchestra in Oman. In every case the artists, the management and the donors were enlivened by the experience.My ambivalence stems from the cost of touring -- in dollars and in hours. Too many arts organizations spend more on touring than they receive in fees. They either must accept the loss or search for sponsorship. And in many cases, this effort requires a huge amount of scarce time and cannibalizes donations that might have gone to other purposes. Arts leaders justify the tour by citing the benefits mentioned above and typically add: touring is good for the image of the organization. That may be true but is it the best way to create image? How many of our family members really know or care about the tours we take? If we took the time and money devoted to organizing a tour and spent it on local activities, would we do more for our image? If we mounted an astonishing new production, created a major outreach project and lowered our ticket prices, would we do more to create long-term support for our institution?For large, well-funded institutions that have the luxury of expanding donor bases that permit them to tour and to create excitement at home, it is undeniable that touring abroad is a benefit.But for smaller organizations -- those that do not have large, engaged families of donors and audience members, those without staffs large enough to add the burden of a tour without sacrificing another project, those that must make extremely difficult choices between a debut tour to Prague and a new production at home -- touring must be evaluated with a truly skeptical eye.And yet, having worked in South Africa during the mid-1990s I can attest to the impact of the cultural boycott on the art and artists of that country. The development of contemporary dance there, for example, was stunted without exchange between dancers and choreographers from other countries. Once Apartheid ended and artists were allowed to travel to South Africa once again, the cultural sector blossomed. Perhaps the most important reason for international exchange is not the impact on any one arts institution but on the society as a whole. Perhaps this is cost that must be borne by an institution to ensure a healthy international arts ecology."

Of course, if successful this may force the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society to change the name of its award to Team of the Year.Full disclosure, I donated, but don't expect any recognition. Nor will I enjoy any of the perks offered. I just liked the idea of social media community working together to achieve something that perhaps an individual alone could not. While donating can be a very selfish act that makes us feel better, social good benefits us all. Collective action like this does more than just fund a cause; it helps the community members involved form a stronger bond.What do you think of this approach to social good?"

Some denominations are trying to wear an accommodating mask under the guise of phrases like ""hate the sin but love the sinner,"" but upon closer examination, we see that these words have a less-than-Christlike tone. How can love be a sin? The ""sin"" here is love, a love that people have no choice about. My hope and prayer is for the church to fully embrace all LGBTQI people. This will have a dramatic impact for many, but most especially for our youth, who do not need to be shamed, ""healed"" or merely tolerated but fully embraced and loved just as they are, beautifully created in God's image. How should the church show Christ's love to all? What does that love look like for my gay brothers and sisters in Christ? How do we create a safe and inclusive faith community where all God's children can come together to worship? Today's church needs to address these questions. I think all Christians can come together on the truth that God is love and God's whole Word speaks to His love for us and the love we should have for our neighbors. I know much about the outpouring of love: I was surrounded by a large outpouring of love from many after the death of my son, Tyler Clementi, most especially from the faith community that Tyler had called home for over 12 years. They showered our family with great love and support after Tyler's death, and I am so very grateful for that. After Tyler's death, in the silence of my shattered world, as I looked deeply into God's Word and listened, God continually and clearly spoke of His unconditional love for all and how we should exhibit God's love to others with kindness and compassion, always seeking unity, giving life, being respectful and welcoming with hospitality and inclusion, always allowing everyone to be at peace with who they are and how God has created them, perfectly and wonderfully made in God's image. Why have we lost this message? The church must start to embrace these truths and stop preaching hate. Sadly, as I look back -- almost as if through Tyler's eyes -- I see things so very differently now. Looking through the eyes of a far-less-mature believer, a child with many uncertainties, and a vulnerable youth with much less confidence in how his sexual orientation fit into God's plan or God's kingdom, I now see the harm and pain that is caused by the misinterpretation of scripture that homosexuality is a sin. Regrettably, Tyler received a clear message from our faith community, whether it was in youth group, Sunday school, the infrequent short sentences that were spoken on rare occasions in the sermon, or maybe even the silence -- the shameful, silent disapproval and judgment of how God created him to be different. But Tyler got the message loud and clear, and clearly that is not a message of love for a young person sitting in the pews next to you. I know Tyler received this message because when Tyler came out to me, he told me he could not be gay and a Christian. Sadly, I too had received this message -- almost without even hearing those few sentences occasionally preached. I too struggled.I knew without question that Tyler was a Christian, a follower of Jesus Christ. God had showed me that long ago, so I was stunned, my heart broken, when he said, ""That works for you, Mom, but not for me."" Sadly, the only words I had to share with Tyler that night were, ""I love you, and so does God."" I said those words out of love, but it has been pointed out to me that Tyler probably perceived those words as rejecting, since Tyler was not seeing God as accepting of his sexual orientation. Faith communities must stop being the bully, exerting their power and influence over their members with such harmful doctrines. The church must stop teaching that homosexuality is a sin. Causing people to feel broken and separated from God because of how God has created them has devastating effects on our youth, as well as on their parents, siblings, grandparents and friends. Faith communities must stop interfering with legislation that would allow all people to share in equal rights, benefits and protections. By not recognizing the love of our gay brothers and sisters in Christ, we tell them that their love is not valid or valued. This causes our gay youth to also think that their love and possibly even they themselves are ""less than"" and not equal to their straight peers. This is wrong. This message of disapproval is so very harmful. Please do not let another child hear this untruth!The answer is simple: We must reexamine those six scriptural passages with open hearts and minds and understand that what Paul was saying to first-century Christians does not translate to what we understand today in 2014 about loving, committed same-sex relationships. We must stop judging; we must stop imposing shame. The church, the Body of Christ, needs to acknowledge that homosexuality is not a sin. The church should apologize, put up a rainbow flag on their church sign and welcome all to God's family. That is how to love our gay Christian brothers and sisters: Love them like God does."

""A country which guaranteed the integrity and inviolability of our territory has committed aggression.""God cannot be on the side of evil, so the enemy of the Ukrainian people is condemned to defeat,"" he said. ""Lord, help us resurrect Ukraine.""It was a strikingly outspoken intervention at a time when many Ukrainians said they were praying for peace with their former Soviet neighbour on a day when Christians celebrate Jesus rising from the dead after his crucifixion.The acting president, Oleksander Turchinov, confined his Easter message to expressions of hope for better days: ""We are living in a fateful time,"" he said, ""when the Ukrainian people have decisively affirmed their striving for freedom and justice.""The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, which still has the loyalty of many congregations across Ukraine despite political strains between the two countries, called for peace.""Our special prayer today is for the peoples of Russia and Ukraine, so that peace should reign in the hearts and minds of our brothers and sisters by blood and by faith, so that the ties that we have lost, and much-needed cooperation, should be restored,"" Patriarch Kirill said in his Easter message.

He believed separatists in the east were a minority.""At the end of the day,"" he said, ""Ukraine will stay united."" (Additional reporting by Christian Lowe in Moscow; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

She will be on hand for the performances on Monday.In March, the Republican-controlled state House voted to slash the school's budget appropriation by $52,000, the amount the college spent on its summer reading program. The program included Bechdel's book, a bestseller that was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award, for incoming freshmen.Republican Representative Garry Smith told Reuters he proposed the cut after a parent complained about the book's ""graphic pictures of two females having sex"" and because the college did not offer another choice for summer reading.The school, whose founders in 1770 included three signers of the Declaration of Independence and three framers of the U.S. Constitution, has said participating in the summer reading program was optional.The Republican-led Senate is now considering the cut, which critics have called an assault on academic freedom.""I don't have a problem with their academic freedom but they're asking someone else to pay for it,"" said Smith, who accused the college of promoting a social agenda. ""We want to send a message to the colleges and universities that their academic freedom comes with responsibility.""The College of Charleston has been buzzing with talk about gay rights ever since a faculty member, in response to the proposed spending cut, reached out to the creators of the recent Off Broadway musical.The nine-member cast, which includes the Tony Award winner Michael Cerveris, offered to perform for free as educational outreach, ""Fun Home"" producer Barbara Whitman said.The college has raised about $20,000 that will be used in addition to the ticket sale proceeds to cover food, lodging and travel expenses for the cast, said Todd McNerney, chairman of the college's department of theater and dance.Also helping to fund the effort is a community foundation grant from the family of Harlan Greene, head of Special Collections at the college's library, who said the shows ""will spark debate on an issue that has been bringing, frankly, all kinds of negative and hate-filled reaction.""Greene said the state's political stance on gay rights is similar to its resistance to racial integration in the 1950s and 1960s.""A lot of southern demagogues at that time said we're not going to knuckle down, we're not going to obey the law of the land,"" he said.

19,GREEN,Keystone XL Delay Could Give Boost To Obama's Political Base,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/keystone-xl-delay_n_5182009.html,,2014-04-20,"FILE - In this Thursday, March 22, 2012 file photo, President Barack Obama speaks at the TransCanada Pipe Yard in Cushing, Okla. The president says that the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project from Canada to Texas should only be approved if it doesn't worsen carbon pollution. Obama says allowing the oil pipeline to be built requires a finding that doing so is in the nation's interest. He says that means determining that the pipeline does not contribute and ""significantly exacerbate"" emissions. (AP Photo/LM Otero, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15538240000510096bd83.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jeff Mason and Steve HollandWASHINGTON, April 20 (Reuters) - The latest delay to a final decision on the Keystone XL oil pipeline will reinforce a White House strategy to energize President Barack Obama's liberal-leaning base before fall elections in which Democrats risk losing control of the U.S. Senate.Environmentalists, worried about the project's effect on climate change, have put enormous pressure on the president to reject the pipeline from Canada's oil sands, staging demonstrations outside the White House and protests in states where he travels.A decision to approve it now could have prompted that vocal group, which was instrumental in electing Obama in 2008 and 2012, to sit out the Nov. 4 congressional elections.The State Department's announcement on Friday that it would give government agencies more time to study the project was seen by strategists from both parties as a move to prevent that and boost Obama in the eyes of his supporters. Support for the president, or lack of it, is generally reflected in mid-term voter turnout.Approval of the pipeline would also have risked dampening the enthusiasm of wealthy donors such as billionaire investor Tom Steyer, who is spending tens of millions of dollars to boost environmentally-friendly candidates.""This is rotten eggs for TransCanada and good news on Good Friday for those who oppose Keystone as not being in our nation's best interest,"" Steyer said in a statement.Obama cannot run for re-election again, but the outcome of the congressional elections, particularly control of the Senate, will determine how much of his agenda can be enacted during his final two years in office.Mobilizing the parts of his base that showed up to vote in 2012, including environmentally-conscious young people, gays and lesbians, Hispanics, and women, is key to helping Democrats in a year when the White House is not up for grabs.But the delay of TransCanada Corp's proposed project to bring oil from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast does carry risks for Obama's party. Republicans, who argue the pipeline would boost job creation, have used the administration's delays to attack Democrats in conservative-leaning states. BOOSTING CORE SUPPORTERSIn November, all of the seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate will be up for election. Republicans already control the House and need a net gain of six seats to take control of the Senate.In recent weeks, Obama has warned of the risks to the party if disillusioned Democrats do not vote in November, and the White House has taken other actions to rev up core Obama supporters. Those include regulations designed to ensure women working for federal contractors are paid equally for work that is similar to that done by men.In addition, Obama has sought to stress his healthcare program's success in signing people up for insurance as a win for Democrats. The party was stung by a shaky rollout last fall.""The biggest problem in any mid-term, especially in a six-year mid-term, is having some level of enthusiasm in the president,"" said Norm Ornstein, a political expert at the American Enterprise Institute.""If you have a lot of people who are angry at you or disillusioned and sit on their hands, you're going to have a disaster in November.""Defeating Keystone XL remains a top priority for Obama's base, and delays on the decision have become a common occurrence. In 2011 the administration said it would study a new route for the pipeline, pushing the process past the 2012 presidential election. The following year further delays were announced. VULNERABLE DEMOCRATSThe State Department said the postponement would allow time for the Nebraska Supreme Court to settle a dispute over the proposed path for the pipeline.A department spokeswoman said politics did not play a role in the decision.Environmentalists welcomed the latest delay. ""Mostly we think this helps us,"" said Michael Brune, executive director of the environmental organization Sierra Club. ""The only thing better than a pipeline that shouldn't be built is to delay it for up to another year or more.""Republicans, meanwhile, indicated the decision would provide fresh fodder for their criticism of Obama over the pipeline. Republicans are looking for new lines of attack on the president after his healthcare law, known as Obamacare, recovered from last year's acute teething problems.Many Democrats are vulnerable to attack, and some worried that the delay on the pipeline decision could undermine moderates such as Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu and Arkansas Senator Mark Pryor whose re-election bids will help determine whether Republicans gain control of the Senate.After the State Department's announcement, Landrieu promised constituents in her energy-producing state that she would wield her power as chair of the Senate Energy Committee to get the Keystone project approved.Landrieu was one of 11 Democratic senators who urged Obama in a letter a week ago to make a decision on the project by May 31. But even if she and her colleagues joined Republicans to pass a bill compelling Obama to approve Keystone XL, they would have a difficult time reaching the necessary two-thirds majority in the 100-person Senate to override a presidential veto.""We don't think it's particularly likely,"" said Christine Tezak, Managing Director at ClearView Energy Partners, LLC about the possibility of Congress forcing the issue.That in itself left an opening for Republicans to exploit.""The biggest impact from our perspective is this takes away the argument from red-state Democratic senators that they have influence in Washington to push things through like Keystone,"" said Tim Miller, executive director of America Rising, a Republican super PAC.
