""Our goal is for everyone to enjoy the race.""Walsh said the city has prepared extensive security measures for preventing as well as responding to emergencies.Over 100 cameras have been installed at more than 50 observation points along the Boston portion of the course.The two ethnic Chechen brothers suspected of planting the bombs at the finish line were identified using footage taken from security camera.One of the brothers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died after a gun battle with police several days after the attack while the other, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is awaiting trial.Officials also emphasized that increased security will be found not just at the finish line, but along the entire course. Though all major marathons are a challenge to secure, given the 26.2 mile spread, the Boston Marathon's route through eight municipalities makes it all the harder for security officials to coordinate protocols.Preparations are also under way to help those affected by the bombings last year cope with feelings that might be triggered by the anniversary, officials said.""The first anniversary of a disaster is always difficult,"" said Barbara Ferrer, director of the Boston public health commission.

(Photo by George Marks/Retrofile/Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baebf1f3c000066000b8e77.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The phrase ""the second shift"" entered the popular lexicon a quarter century ago, when sociologist Arlie Hochschild and Anne Machung published a popular book by that name. Based on in-depth interviews and in-home observations of working couples, the book revealed that, despite entering the labor market and pursuing careers in record numbers, women were still taking care of most of the routine household and childcare responsibilities. The authors documented the toll that balancing career and unpaid domestic labor was taking on families, and women in particular -- in stress, marital tension, exhaustion and guilt.Many others have studied this ""double burden"" in the years since, and surprisingly little has changed. Wives still report doing about twice as much housework and childcare as their husbands, and this imbalance often poses a barrier to women's professional advancement. One difference is that today's couples, even if they unconsciously embrace traditional gender stereotypes and live less-than-egalitarian lives, may publicly proclaim more egalitarian values.How are these conflicted couples' kids affected by all of this? Are their own professional and family aspirations shaped by what they see at home, or by what they hear publicly, or by hidden stereotypes -- or by all three? University of British Columbia psychological scientist Alyssa Croft and her colleagues decided to explore this important question, and to disentangle these competing influences on kids' views of gender and work -- and their hopes for the future.To do so, the scientists recruited more than 300 children and at least one of their parents. Fathers of sons and daughters and mothers of sons and daughters were all represented in the sample, so the scientists could explore the various parent-child dynamics. They first asked parents and children who did what at home -- dishes, cleaning, cooking, childcare, laundry -- and how many hours each partner worked for pay outside the home. They also asked the adults to choose the stereotype -- working person or stay-at-home parent -- they identified with. In addition to asking them directly, the scientists used a test of automatic, implicit attitudes toward gender and work.Then the assessed the kids. They asked them which stereotype they most aspired to be like when they grew up. They also asked them specifically what adult occupation they had in mind for the future.The scientists analyzed all the information from parents and children, with some interesting insights. For example, mothers' explicit views about gender roles at home -- this was a reliable indicator of their kids' attitudes toward this issue. But for daughters in particular, what mattered in shaping their gender attitudes were what the parents really believed and how they acted. Specifically, girls were more likely to envision themselves in careers when their fathers were more egalitarian in their beliefs about domestic labor -- and also when their mothers actually did less household work and were more career-oriented.Talk is cheap, and when it comes to gender roles, not that influential. Over and above parents' explicitly stated beliefs, fathers' actual dishwashing and diaper changing played a key role in shaping daughters' aspirations for the future. That is, when dad believed in equality at home, and didn't unconsciously link women and housework, and actually did his share of the drudgery -- if all this was true, their daughters aspired to less stereotypical careers. These findings suggest that, even when parents explicitly endorse gender equality at home, their hidden stereotypical beliefs and an actual non-egalitarian division of labor at home -- these send the more powerful message to young girls that they should limit their aspirations.The findings about fathers, reported in a forthcoming issue of the journal Psychological Science, are particularly interesting and surprising. Despite being male and despite the mothers often being the primary caregiver and controlling domestic matters, fathers powerfully influence their daughters' professional aspirations. Why is unclear. They could be modeling future mates, signaling to their daughters that the can and should expect a man's contribution at home. Or fathers that really pitch in may have more opportunities to influence their daughters, acting in effect as gatekeepers to roles that are not stereotypical.Perhaps the most compelling explanation is the most obvious: Fathers' influence on the daughters may result from the beliefs and actions of the mothers in these families. After all, dads who do the laundry and make school lunches may very well marry women who are successful at work and who themselves defy the stereotypes."

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb154b22500003200381e4c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The 300-acre landslide in Oso, Washington, which killed at least 30 people and destroyed the local community on March 22, 2014, reveals a consequence of a relatively unregulated and unseen industry: logging. Logging was not the sole cause of the disaster -- March was the wettest on record, a condition possibly exacerbated by climate change, and the geology of the area features soft soils -- but logging apparently played a major role. The media often do not investigate the reasons behind an event such as the landslide, attributing to ""Mother Nature"" or ""Acts of God"" disasters that were actually manmade. For example, Time magazine called the Oso landslide a ""natural disaster"" without mentioning the likely influences of logging and climate change. The plateau above the hillside that gave way has been logged for almost a century, and the hillside has a history of landslides dating back more than 60 years. For more than 25 years, as the slope became more unstable, scientists challenged the timber cutting and warned of possible calamity. Yet the state continued to allow logging on the plateau. A ""clear-cut"" is an area of land in which all the trees have been cut down. One suspected trigger of the Oso landslide is a clear-cut, undertaken 9 years ago, that apparently encroached into a restricted area and is only now being investigated. The landslide, which occurred near the banks of the Stillaguamish River, was not only predictable; it was also predicted. New York Times reporter Timothy Egan recounts touring the headwaters of the Stillaguamish 25 years ago with Pat Stevenson, a biologist with the local Stillaguamish tribe: ""Stevenson pointed uphill, to bare, saturated earth that was melting, like candle wax, into the main mudslide. Not long ago, this had been a thick forest of old growth timber. But after it was excessively logged, every standing tree removed, there was nothing to hold the land in place during heavy rains. A federal survey determined that nearly 50 percent of the entire basin above Deer Creek had been logged over a 30-year period. It didn't take a degree in forestry to see how one event led to the other."" Forest root systems hold the soil in place, and old-growth forests absorb about ten times as much water as clear-cut land. Logging usually occurs far from the public eye. Most people remain unaware of the devastation wrought by typical modern logging practices, which rely on large machines and few workers to clear-cut the land. Near public roadways, uncut ""beauty strips"" of forest give passing motorists the illusion of unspoiled landscapes. Satellite images, however, often provide a very different, bird's-eye view of shorn forests. Logging plans are not widely publicized. In my home state of Massachusetts, logging plans are filed with the town's conservation commission, which is often a group of volunteers. Even in the small town in which I live, and where I am relatively plugged-in to the goings-on, I was taken by surprise by the sound of logging machines near my house several years ago. When people complain about rapacious logging, the toilet paper argument is invariably used to shut them up. The fact that we all use toilet paper is supposed to provide a carte blanche for loggers to do whatever they want to the forest. Yes, we all use wood, but many of the trees that are cut are wasted, often used to fuel biomass power plants, which have disastrous environmental impacts, or to create single-use pallets, junk mail and excess packaging. Much wood and paper ends up in a landfill or incinerator instead of being recycled or reused. Logging proponents trivialize the damage from logging, arguing that although the land initially looks ravaged, the trees will grow back. They neglect to mention that this process takes decades and that invasive species may be what grow back. Forester Gordon Robinson writes, ""If logging looks bad, it is bad. If a forest appears to be mismanaged, it is mismanaged."" A system of belief that defies science and justifies irresponsible logging has become entrenched in our government agencies and universities (particularly, in university forestry departments largely funded by the logging industry). One popular excuse for logging is to claim that the trees are diseased and need to be cut down for the good of the forest. Another popular excuse is that trees should be cut down to help wildlife. Loggers escape the burden of proving such claims. Government agencies often green-light logging without adequate environmental impact analysis or protection of vital resources. Rather, the burden of proof that logging may be damaging unfairly falls on unpaid citizens.In 2006 and 2007, a group of citizens in Massachusetts applied modern science -- bringing in experts as needed -- to refute one unsupported excuse after another attempting to justify logging in Robinson State Park. The would-be loggers floated out 22 reasons to log the land, and the citizens shot down each one. The state ultimately denied the timber company a permit; not one reason to log could be found that had any legs. Today, Robinson State Park is safe from logging and proves that intense public pressure can overcome even entrenched pro-logging bureaucracies.Logging is treated as a presumptive right, even on public land. For example, in Washington, if a permit application to log is not reviewed by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) within 30 days, it is automatically approved. And not only is enforcement of logging regulations lax, but the regulations themselves are inadequate. Forestry seems to operate in the fantasy world of the 1950s, before the advent of modern environmental regulations. Paul Kennard, a geomorphologist with the National Park Service, explains that the DNR is pressured by timber companies, in a ""no tree left behind"" environment: ""It's a don't-rock-the-boat culture ... a very cronyistic, forester-friendly, we're-gonna-help-these-folks culture."" Forests provide much more than wood. They hold our earth together, mitigate climate change, filter the air and water, cool the earth, provide flood storage, offer habitat and food for countless species and create a refuge for the human soul. Irresponsible logging erases these benefits, rolls out the welcome mat for invasive species and Lyme disease carriers and releases carbon dioxide, worsening climate change.It's time to halt irresponsible logging practices and bring the timber industry to accountability. Citizens can speak up to loggers and legislators. Wood harvesting can be done intelligently to supply what we need without damaging our lands, undermining our other resources and endangering our citizens. Is our society unable to make change until catastrophic, headline-making fatalities occur? With the Oso landslide, this prerequisite has been tragically satisfied.

But the 27-year-old pop knockout touched down in familiar ground in Indio, Calif. this weekend to return to the stage at Coachella. Having recently been tapped to do the music for the hit film ""Divergent,"" Goulding clearly knows her audience. Teens flood the fields at Coachella and she couldn't be in better company. The Huffington Post spoke with the energetic artist leading up to Coachella to talk about her bestie Lorde, how little she's planning to wear at the festival and what band she's most excited to see. You and Lorde are  very tight and are both performing at Coachella this year. Have you guys ever talked about collaborating on a song together?  I’m sure we have talked about it jokingly. But of course, anyone who’s a good person and a good musician is perfect to make music with. There are a lot of people who are very talented, but then there are people who are very talented and very humble -- and those are the people you end up making good stuff with. She’s a good one. She’s a good egg. And she deserves everything she’s worked for. Are you planning on seeing her show at Coachella?  I actually just found out that we will be at Lollapalooza together and we literally had no idea. A couple years ago, I got to watch Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre at Coachella and it was awesome. It was the best. They always bring something really special back. It’s the place for reunions and special performances. Obviously I’d love to see Ella [Lorde] perform, hopefully I’ll be there for that.You have toured all over the world -- what does it feel like to perform at a festival versus doing your own tour or show? Festivals are so much more fun -- there’s just something about them. People are excited to be outside. They’re also just a bit more excitable. Where sometimes with shows, when it’s just your own show and people have bought a ticket and have been anticipating it, they watch me do a show and sometimes people are really crazy and dance a lot, and other times people are kind of standing there. But it’s nice that things aren’t predictable. You don’t know what a crowd will be like. It’s very different every city.What was your experience like working on “Divergent”? A producer told us their template was Simon & Garfunkel in ""The Graduate.” That’s a pretty high bar. Really? God, wow. It was awesome. It was like nothing I’ve really done before. I had real free reign over what I could do with my voice. I love any situation where I’m able to really kind of go crazy with my voice because a lot of the time, I make pop songs. I love to make pop music. And even though I don’t really listen to pop music, it’s still my favorite thing to do [laughs]. This was cool because I got to do some crazy shit with my voice.Did they tell you they needed a certain number of songs, or songs that evoked a certain emotion? I watched the film and I saw where they needed music and what the key points were. Many parts of it are really touching. I wanted to make sure I did it justice. My experience of being young watching film was that the soundtrack was everything. The “Amelie” soundtrack is one for me. I have the soundtrack for “Man On Fire” with Hans Zimmer, you know the film with Denzel Washington? And I’ve never even seen it.I’ve seen you in concert and you have great style. Coachella is known for inspiring some really incredible outfits. How do you decide what you’re going to wear and is there pressure to look ‘cool’? For me the most important thing is to perform well. So I always want to wear something I’m very comfortable in and obviously it gets very hot so I’ll wear, well, not much -- depending on how hot it is! I am thinking of a few things I might wear, I have a few summery things. I just came from England and I have a suitcase full of sweaters and jeans. Touring is a lot of shifting things around and sorting things out. I’m constantly having to rearrange.You have been traveling at ton. Do you adjust well to being on the road or are you looking forward to having some time at home? I like being on tour when you have someone helping you out, and I have a very dear friend with me helping me out. When you have that person, it’s perfect. We do yoga and running and workouts together. You can get yourself into a stable routine of eating well. Whereas at home, I do that too, but on tour you can be even a bit more regimented about it. To be honest, I am really ready to stop touring for a bit. I’m just tired. I feel like I’ve got so much to catch up on. I wasn’t there when so many of my friends are getting married, having babies. I know it seems crazy, but there’s just so much that I’m missing out on. I do have a really incredible job and I get to be on tour with my favorite people, but at the same time, I’m staring to think that I want to spend a substantial amount of time at home. Is there one thing you do to help yourself get through these long grueling stretches? Do you meditate? Do you try to sleep more? I suppose one thing I do on tour is sleep more. Not to the point where I’m constantly sleeping, but I definitely try to force myself to rest a bit more. Just so that my voice is really rested and I’m in a good mood. I go to bed at 1 or 2 in the morning when I’m on tour just because the show finishes late and then we all shower and stuff and get on the bus and by the time the bus leaves, it’s about 2 a.m. And because the bus is so noisy and constantly stopping, it means that you’re always getting up throughout the night. You don’t really have a full night sleep. You end up having to compensate by staying in bed until mid-day. Which sounds nuts. As soon as I’m up and awake, I go out running or I go workout. Who are you most excited to see at Coachella? I definitely would love to see Outkast. I know my band and my friends will want to.
