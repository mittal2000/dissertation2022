The 28-year-old soldier is at a medical clinic in the U.S. base at Bagram, Afghanistan, said Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale, a spokesman for the Department of Defense. Bergdahl will eventually travel to Germany before heading back to the States.At the White House on Saturday evening, Bergdahl’s parents, Bob and Jani, joined President Obama, who praised the troops and government officials who rescued their son.“We will continue to stay strong for Bowe while he recovers,” Jani Bergdahl said after Obama turned the podium over to her.Bob Bergdahl said he is not sure whether his son can still speak English, and he made some of his remarks in what appeared to be the Pashto language. “I’m your father, Bowe,” he said at one point.Bob Bergdahl quit his job as a driver for UPS two or three years before retirement so he could spend all his time trying to win the release of his son, Proctor said.Although raised in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, Bowe Bergdahl spent time during his late teens in a Buddhist monastery in the Pacific Northwest.“He was going through an exploratory phase in life. He’d grown up in a conservative Christian home and he was trying to figure out if this was his faith or his parents’ faith,” said Proctor.Bergdahl’s decision to join the military wasn’t a surprise to people who knew him.It came partly out of a desire “to better understand a different part of the world and to try to see for himself what was going on,” Proctor said. “That would be a very Bowe thing to do.”(Elizabeth Weise writes for USA Today.

The 19-year-old told a friend he wanted to record history.Before he left his home late on June 3, 1989, he asked his mother""Do you think the troops would open fire?"" She said she did not. Around three hours later, he was shot dead by soldiers.As his 77-year-old mother, Zhang Xianling, prepares to mark the 25th anniversary of her son's death, she is under around-the-clock surveillance by eight police and security officers.Zhang said the level of scrutiny this year was unprecedented. As early as April, police officers barred foreign journalists, including Reuters reporters, from visiting her home.""I find it ridiculous, I'm an old lady,"" Zhang told Reuters by telephone. ""What can I say (to reporters)? I don't know any state secrets. All I can talk about is the matter concerning my son. What is there to be afraid of?""The Chinese Communist Party's harshest crackdown on political dissent in recent years would suggest plenty.As Wednesday's big anniversary of the bloody repression of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square approached, authorities deployed hundreds of police, many armed with rifles, to patrol the area.Rights group Amnesty International said at least 66 people have been detained in connection with the anniversary, and major Chinese internet sites censor references to the day on which hundreds, possibly thousands of unarmed civilians were killed.For Zhang, whenever she wants to travel anywhere she is driven in a police car. Two police officers walk with her when she goes to the market.In previous years, Zhang said she was usually guarded by three to five police officers who would appear outside her home a month before the anniversary. XI TAKES HARD LINEThe extraordinary measures are explained by the fact that she is one of the co-founders of a group of families called the Tiananmen Mothers, who have long demanded justice for the victims of the massacre.Ding Zilin, the other co-founder who was traveling in the eastern city of Wuxi, near Shanghai, was not allowed to return to Beijing, said Zhang and other rights activists.""There is much empathy for them given they lost children in 1989,"" said William Nee, Amnesty International's China researcher. ""They are seen as credible and their continued fight for justice, especially given their age, has drawn much sympathy.""The authorities are acutely aware of this and that is why we believe they are placed under such heavy surveillance this year.""Asked about the restrictions on the Tiananmen Mothers, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the legal rights of Chinese citizens are guaranteed, but every Chinese citizen must ""consciously respect the country's rules and laws"".Since Xi Jinping became president in March last year, his administration has taken a hard line on dissent, detaining and jailing activists, clamping down on Internet critics and tightening curbs on journalists in what rights groups call the worst suppression of free expression for several years.Censors have scrubbed out references on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, to 'May 35th', a substitute for the date of the Tiananmen crackdown.Tencent Holdings Ltd's microblog censors the characters for 'willow silk', which sound similar to the words 'six four', a Chinese way to say June 4.Qihoo 360 Technology Co censors 'VIIIIXVIIV', the Roman numerals for '8 9 6 4' or June 4, 1989.""The government is concerned about what they call stability maintenance,"" said Andrew Nathan, a professor of political science who specializes in Chinese politics at Columbia University in New York.Nathan said Chinese leaders are concerned about the so-called ""Arab Spring"" uprisings and revolutions in Ukraine, and want to prevent such open acts of rebellion against the state from taking hold in China.""So their idea of preventing it is not to take the lid off and let people hash things out, but instead try to prevent anybody from raising any of these troubling issues,"" he said. ""WE'VE LEFT THE BATTLEFIELD""After initially tolerating the student-led demonstrations in the spring of 1989, the Communist Party sent in troops to crush a rare display of public defiance.The government has never released a death toll from the violence, but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundred to several thousand.Stunned by the government's harsh response to the Tiananmen movement that officials have termed ""counter-revolutionary"", and tired of decades of turmoil under Communist rule, many Chinese people now balk at the idea of mass revolution.Instead, they chase new opportunities offered by the country's booming economic growth. And while the authorities have moved swiftly to squash criticism of the one-party system, people are enjoying the kind of individual freedoms never accorded them before.They can report on corrupt officials, sue the government for pollution and miscarriages of justice, and stage protests for labor and environmental rights.The Chinese government has also loosened the one-child policy, allowing many urban couples to have two children.It has been effective, too, in scrubbing out memories of the 1989 protests. Many young people, indoctrinated by years of ""patriotic education"", have no inkling of the movement.Beijing has forced many of the student leaders into exile in the United States, Hong Kong and Taiwan, where they are effectively neutralized, being barred from the mainland.""Once we leave China, we've left the battlefield,"" said Wu'er Kaixi, a leading figure in the pro-democracy movement who now lives in Taiwan. ""We are no longer the main actors on the stage.""Wang Dan, who was one of the most visible leaders in the movement and is also in exile in Taiwan, said he was able to hold a ""democracy salon"" - an open forum for intellectuals to discuss political problems - at Peking University 25 years ago.""Everyone knows that anyone who dares to do anything like that these days will be detained. This is a clear regression from where we were back then.""

4,BUSINESS,American Youth Are Bombarded By E-Cigarette Ads,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ecigarette-ads-youth-smoking_n_5431603.html,,2014-06-02,"This September 25, 2013 photo illustration taken in Washington, DC, shows a woman smoking an 'Blu' e-cigarette (electronical cigarette). The National Association of Attorneys General on September 24, issued a letter urging the US Food and Drug Administration to clamp down on the fast-growing e-cigarette market, saying manufacturers are enticing teenagers to smoke with cartoon characters, television ads and bubble-gum flavors. AFP PHOTO / Jim WATSON (Photo credit should read JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30dfe1f00002e0123be66.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Andrew M. SeamanNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The amount of television advertising for electronic cigarettes that American adolescents saw jumped by more than 250 percent over the past few years, according to a new study.Researchers said the extra exposure to e-cigarette marketing, if not curtailed by regulation and countered by public health messages, could lead more youth to start using the devices.“It appears that youth are being exposed to a sustained level of marketing about the benefits of e-cigarettes,” said Jennifer Duke, the study’s lead author from the nonprofit research organization RTI International in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. “In television, that can be influential.”E-cigarettes were first introduced in China in 2004. The battery-powered devices let users inhale nicotine-infused vapors, which don't contain the harmful tar and carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke.Concerns about use of the devices by teens and young adults include the possibility that nicotine could harm developing brains, that the safety of the inhaled vapors has not been established and that nicotine use could lead to smoking traditional cigarettes.“I think - as a potential gateway to future use - this could potentially cause public health harm,” Duke said.Unlike traditional cigarettes and other tobacco products, e-cigarette advertisements are not subject to federal regulations.The proportion of young people who report ever having used e-cigarettes is already growing. The number more than doubled from about 3 percent in 2011 to about 7 percent in 2012, Duke and her colleagues write in the journal Pediatrics.“We thought it was important to look at trends in advertising,” she said.By analyzing data from the Nielsen ratings company, the researchers looked for patterns in e-cigarette marketing from January 2011 to September 2013.To estimate young people’s exposure to e-cigarette advertising, they used Nielsen's system of target rating points, or TRPs, which measure the portion of a specific population within a TV commercial’s total audience that saw an ad.For example, a commercial with a 50 ""youth TRP"" may have been viewed five times by 10 percent of the youth audience or once by 50 percent of that audience in a given period.From 2011 through the first half of 2012, e-cigarette ads had fewer than 100 TRPs among kids between the ages of 12 and 17 years old. That rose and peaked at 347 TRPs from April to June 2013 before declining to 275 TRPs by September.During the same period in five specific target markets, including Columbus, Ohio and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, youth TRPs for e-cigarette ads were over 1,000.The national numbers could mean that 50 percent of all kids in that age group saw 21 e-cigarette ads from October 2012 to September 2013, the researchers write. Or, it could mean 80 percent of adolescents saw 13 ads during that time.The increase over the entire study period represents a 256 percent rise in TRPs for e-cigarette ads between 2011 and 2013.The researchers found that more than three quarters of the ad exposure occurred on cable networks, including Country Music Television, Comedy Central, TV Land and VH1.For young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 years, the TRP numbers were even greater than for adolescents, and represent a 321 percent increase in exposure from 2011 through 2013.The increased exposure among teens and young adults was largely driven by an ad campaign from one brand of e-cigarettes known as blu eCigs, which is owned by the cigarette manufacturer Lorillard Inc.“We have proactively set limitations on when and where blu eCigs can be marketed in an effort to minimize any potential exposure to minors, a part of our criteria is to screen all marketing opportunities to ensure that our TV ads only run with media targeting an adult audience of 85 percent or greater,” blu eCigs told Reuters Health in a statement.In a perspective piece published in the same journal, Drs. Emily Duffy and Brian Jenssen from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia called for more oversight of the e-cigarette industry.“There’s really nothing controlling the quality or the safety of these products,” Duffy, a pediatrician, told Reuters Health. “I think it just makes sense that in any situation when there is a product being marketed that has a potentially addictive or harmful substance, it really makes sense for an organization like the (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) to regulate these items.”A 75-day comment period for e-cigarette regulations that FDA proposed in April is currently in effect. In May, a group of urban health officials urged FDA to regulate e-cigarettes more like traditional tobacco products, including restrictions on ads (see Reuters article of May 1, 2014, here: http://reut.rs/1hoccAN).“For parents, it’s important to try to maintain a dialogue with their children on the risks of any substances – particularly with e-cigarettes, because there is so much that’s unknown about them,” Duffy said.Duke thinks some regulation of e-cigarette ads is needed or the situation will likely remain unchanged.“I think if current trends continue, e-cigarette use among youth and young adults will continue to rise,” she said."

The online behemoth also stopped pre-orders of books from the French publisher as negotiations stall over e-book pricing. Amazon's move, perceived by many as a corporate behemoth flexing its muscles, has prompted boycotts by the book industry advocates. In a twist of literary irony, many of those boycotters may instead do business with one of the world's biggest and most reviled companies.Walmart, meanwhile, slashed 40 percent off up to 400 Hachette titles and advertised faster shipping of the publisher's books.“We’re committed to making it easy for our customers to have access to a broad assortment of the products they want, at the low prices they want – including copies of their favorite books that they might not be able to get elsewhere,"" Walmart said in a statement forwarded to The Huffington Post by a spokeswoman.In May, Amazon  suspended preorders of Hachette books, including surefire blockbusters like the new J.K. Rowling novel “The Silkworm,” written under the nom-de-plume Robert Galbraith, and Patterson’s “Invisible.” Above: Walmart's discounted copy of the new J.K. Rowling book, with a preorder shipping date of June 19. Below: Amazon's offer to email customers when the book becomes available. Hachette did not immediately respond to requests from HuffPost for comment. Amazon spokeswoman Sarah Gelman referred HuffPost to an 549-word statement it put out last week that said the company has a responsibility to haggle Hachette for the lowest possible price, adding: “We are not optimistic that this will be resolved soon.”For Walmart, the standoff provides a rare opportunity to get a leg up on its digital rival.The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer poured money into its @WalmartLabs division last year, buying up a handful of startups as it beefed up its offices in Silicon Valley and poached 150 new hires from companies like Yahoo and eBay.“Don’t think for a second that Jeff Bezos is not a capitalist,” Neil M. Ashe, chief executive of Walmart Global E-Commerce, told The New York Times of the founder and chief executive of Amazon. “They’re just playing a game, which is, ‘We’re just going to wait out the world.’""Still, Walmart has a long way to go.Speaking at a major tech conference last week, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon admitted, admitted, “we’re not as aggressive on some things as we should be.”“Clearly Amazon is teaching the world what’s possible,” McMillion told the audience. Another possible lesson: Hachette offerings are still available in your local bookstores."

Ukraine's critical presidential election got underway Sunday under the wary scrutiny of a world eager for stability in a country rocked by a deadly uprising in the east.(AP Photo/Sergei Chuzavkov)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cb7e260000360083b758.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Sunday May 25, the ""Chocolate King"" handily won the Ukrainian presidential elections in the first round. Billionaire Petro O. Poroshenko is so named because he made his fortune in the confectionary business. The defeated runner-up, former prime minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko is sometimes referred to as ""the Gas Princess,"" since she struck it rich in the energy sector. It seems that Ukraine has not yet achieved the nominal separation of oligarchy and state that we have in the United States, and being extremely rich is almost a constitutional requirement to run for president - like being at least 35 years old and a natural-born citizen is here.The U.S. government, which has invested billions of dollars over the past 20 years to bring Ukraine into its political/military alliance in the region, seems pleased with the result. It has become standard operating procedure to get an elected government as soon as possible after a coup such as the one that toppled the prior elected (also super-rich) President Viktor Yanukovych in February with help from Western governments. Yanukovych, who tried to balance his government between the competing interests of the U.S./EU and Russia, never really had a chance. If he had agreed to the IMF conditions, his government would probably have become at least as unpopular as it did when he turned to Russia for a desperately-needed $15 billion dollar loan.Which brings us to today: the new government of the Chocolate King is committed to those same conditions, now spelled out in an IMF agreement released at the end of April. I would not want to be in his shoes. After two years of almost no economic growth, the IMF is now projecting a steep recession for this year, with the economy shrinking by 5 percent. This is largely because of budget tightening that the government has committed to, amounting to about 3 percent of GDP over the next two years. (For comparison, think of the U.S. government cutting $500 billion, roughly the equivalent of the Pentagon's annual base allocation, from its budget over two years.) The economy is supposed to recover next year, but we have heard that before -- think of Greece, or Spain, or eurozone austerity generally over the past four years.Poroshenko took a hard line against Russia during his electoral campaign, which was not surprising since millions of Russian-speaking voters in eastern Ukraine would not be voting anyway -- some because they didn't consider the election legitimate and many because armed militants closed the polling places. But he has since become friendlier, emphasizing his good personal relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. This is probably a smart move, and not only because Russia can help him negotiate an end to the civil conflict. (Recent events indicate that Russia may have less influence on separatists in eastern Ukraine than the U.S. and EU have on their allies in the west.)As it turns out, Putin does not appear interested in annexing more pieces of a divided Ukraine, contrary to the assertions of some in the U.S. His main goal seems more likely to be preventing Ukraine from becoming another base for the NATO military alliance, on its border, which in Russia is understandably seen as a threat. (NATO added 12 countries from Eastern Europe between 1999-2009.) And this could be better achieved through negotiations. As for Poroshenko, depending on how badly things go with the IMF/EU program, he may end up needing help from Russia after all. At the very least he wouldn't want to leave himself completely at the mercy of the IMF-Washington-EU decision-makers. They have a plan to restructure Ukraine's economy, and it could turn out to be a mass-unemployment nightmare.____________ This article was distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service on May 28, 2014 and published on May 29th by The Chicago Tribune and other newspapers."

That's the question former State Department whistleblower Peter Van Buren recently asked at his We Meant Well blog -- and it couldn't be a smarter one. After all, the Isla Vista killer, Elliot Rodger, made both his own sense of disturbance and his urge for ""retribution"" against women quite public before he went on his terror spree. Shouldn't the agency, whose unofficial motto (""collect it all"") seems to be meant quite literally, have noticed his messages to the world?Given the ridiculous mass of human communications the NSA collects, both domestically and globally, perhaps not. But one reason its employees might not have been paying attention was that Rodgers wasn't an Islamic jihadist-in-the-making or an al-Qaeda wannabe. He didn't fall among the few fringe figures since 9/11 who have committed domestic acts of Islamic terror, including Army psychiatrist Nidal Hasan, who slaughtered 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, the Tsarnaev brothers who briefly terrorized Boston, or Faisal Shahzad who managed to get a car bomb into New York's Times Square. Of course, it's worth remembering that the agency American taxpayers support to the tune of almost $11 billion a year and that has made surveillance in the name of ""safety"" part of the American way of life somehow missed them, too! Still, for the NSA one thing is clear enough: the Elliot Rodgers of this world may blow Americans away in numbers that put the casualty counts for what we call ""domestic terrorism"" to shame, but they aren't considered ""terrorists"" and the war they are engaged in -- against women -- doesn't qualify for any ""war on terror.""The numbers tell a grim story when it comes to this sort of terror in American life. Among other things, if you're adding up casualties in this unnamed war, 1,500 women are murdered annually by their husbands or boyfriends. That adds up to a 9/11-sized disaster every two years. On the other side of things, in the wake of the killings in Isla Vista, California, and without the NSA stepping in to botch things up, the response to such terror has been extraordinary. In ""Our Words Are Our Weapons,"" Rebecca Solnit, whose new Dispatch Book, Men Explain Things to Me, focuses on just what violence against women means in our society, offers her usual highly original look at ways in which women (and some men) are reconceiving our world and the horrors in it.

Here's How.,Kevin Short,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/soda-tax-calories_n_5432605.html,,2014-06-02,"UNITED STATES - MARCH 16: Former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin drinks a 'Big Gulp' soda to mock the soda law in New York during the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference at the Gaylord National Resort & Conference Center at National Harbor, Md., on Saturday, March 16, 2013.(Photo By Douglas Graham/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30e01250000cf00389e4b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Soda taxes can work, according to a new study. We've just been proposing the wrong type.A new study published in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics finds that taxing soda by volume or outright banning large sugary drinks isn't the smartest way to improve public health. Instead, it's all about taxing soda per calorie. That means that in an ideal, soda-taxing world, according to the researchers, a 12-oz. Coca Cola (150 calories) would be charged a 6 cent tax, while a larger, 20-oz. bottle of Vitamin Water (120 calories) would be taxed only 4.8 cents. The study found that when there's a per-calorie tax, people are more inclined to opt for the cheaper, healthier drinks. “It provides a better incentive to the consumer to switch to lower-calorie drinks, which would be taxed at a lower rate than higher-calorie drinks,” Dr. Chen Zhen, the study's author, told the New York Times. “One of the concerns about taxing ounces of sugar-sweetened beverages is that consumers are paying the same tax whether they buy 12 ounces of a drink with 150 calories or 12 ounces of a drink with 50 calories.""The study shows that a .04 cent tax per calorie on non-alcoholic beverages would cause Americans to consume 9.3 percent fewer calories from drinks. Over the course of one year, that would amount to 5,800 fewer calories.While many states and cities have proposed taxing sugary drinks, the U.S. has not been so receptive to the idea on the whole. In fact most Americans oppose any form of a soda tax.Mexico recently passed an historic 10 percent tax on sugary drinks, prompting some American legislatures to consider the idea once again. But researchers are well aware of how politically volatile a sugar tax can be.""We are trying to stay away from the politics,"" Zhen told the Times."

The administration should challenge Maduro to restore normal diplomatic relations. The US and Venezuela have not exchanged ambassadors since 2010.,2014-06-02,"Demonstrators take part in an anti-government rally in Caracas on May 14, 2014. About 80 demonstrators were arrested during a protest as they request the immediate release of youth detained in recent days.

Talks between the government and opposition are paralyzed. Mediators from South American countries and the Vatican have withdrawn. Hundreds of protesters remain jailed in a standoff that has claimed 42 lives.  For average Venezuelans, the conflict has compounded the hardships of daily life. Inflation has reportedly reached 60 percent. There are shortages of basic goods, and rationing of electricity and water. Besides abuses by security forces over the last months, residents of Caracas and other cities are forced to navigate some of the most crime-ridden streets in the world.  For the United States, the crisis presents another set of obstacles. It is one of several foreign policy dilemmas that call on the United States to exercise leadership in circumstances that come with high stakes but no quick fixes. Venezuela is a test of how Washington, after a decade dominated by Iraq and Afghanistan, manages distinct challenges in places as varied as Ukraine and Syria, Nigeria and the South China Sea.  A peaceful, stable and democratic Venezuela is important to the United States. With the world's largest oil reserves, Venezuela is the fourth largest source of US oil imports. Oil and ideology have given Venezuela's government outsized diplomatic clout, from Cuba to China. The late President Hugo Chavez used charisma, fiat and the national treasury to launch a populist revolution that sought to contest US influence across Latin America.  The revolution has left Venezuela bitterly polarized and economically flattened. Chavez's successor, President Nicolas Maduro, can rally support from beneficiaries of state programs, mostly the poor, and the military. But polls show a majority fed up with economic scarcity, crime and limits on political freedom. That frustration has inspired opposition party members and students to bravely risk their lives by taking to the streets.  In April, Maduro agreed to enter into a dialogue with the opposition, mediated by Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and the representative of the Vatican. The opposition came to the table asking for the release of political prisoners, disarming government militias, ending press censorship and an impartial investigation of human rights abuses. The government's failure to address these points seriously caused the suspension of talks after a few weeks.  The Obama administration has remained attentively on the sidelines, endorsing talks but wary of giving Maduro ammunition to blame the protests on a US plot to overthrow him. This has been a reasonable course up to now. But as Secretary of State Kerry said last week in Mexico, the administration is growing impatient. It's time to consider new options.  The bipartisan bill moving through Congress, passed by the House on May 28, that would impose sanctions on Venezuelan officials is not the most promising alternative -- chiefly because it's unlikely to be effective. The measure, which would freeze and ban US visas for officials implicated in human rights abuses, could damage the opposition. South American countries that are mediating the talks have come out against it.  Instead, the White House and Congress should move beyond a choice between neglect and intervention. The starting point would be a commitment to apply sustained energy and focus on Venezuela. The United States should work closely with Brazil, Colombia and other regional players on a unified policy that insists on dialogue and measures results. As Chavez tried to divide the region, the United States should be a force for unity.  The crisis is also a chance to think boldly about other actors with big stakes in Venezuela. Cuba is kept afloat by Venezuelan oil; in return Havana sends security advisers and doctors. Maduro has pledged that oil exports to China will surpass those to the US. China and Cuba both desire a stable partner. Along with our regional allies, we should deliver the strong message that only democracy in Caracas can deliver long-term stability.  There is one direct approach to Caracas immediately available. The administration should challenge Maduro to restore normal diplomatic relations. The US and Venezuela have not exchanged ambassadors since 2010. If Caracas refuses, the administration could appoint a special envoy to focus on Venezuela, raising the profile of US engagement.  The goal of US policy in Venezuela is not regime change. The earliest Maduro can face a referendum on his rule is 2016. But, in Venezuela and elsewhere, the United States can and should stand up forcefully for dialogue and reconciliation leading to freer democratic participation -- and develop the most effective tools for each international challenge.  In the new world disorder, the principles behind US policy remain the same. It's the old formulas that don't work anymore.__________ Mack McLarty was White House chief of staff and Special Envoy for the Americas under President Bill Clinton.

Businessman David Perdue, who is competing in a Republican runoff in the hope of succeeding retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), has sat on the board of the Wisconsin-based Alliant Energy Corp. since 2001. As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports, during his tenure on the utility company's board, Perdue served on the board’s environmental and safety committee while the company’s leaders voiced support for efforts to implement a cap-and-trade system to limit carbon emissions. A number of utility and energy companies didn't immediately oppose cap and trade when Obama first proposed it back in 2009, perhaps because they foresaw that state-based cap-and-trade systems would entail fewer limitations than the Environmental Protection Agency's new rules, which call for a 30 percent cut in carbon emissions from existing power plants by 2030.The new EPA rules allow states to meet the new emissions standards by directing power plants to cut emissions, increasing the amount of energy drawn from renewable sources or implementing cap-and-trade markets. A Perdue spokesman told the paper that he had no role in the company's cap-and-trade position and as a board member had limited say in the utility's day-to-day operations. The Senate candidate's role at Alliant also came under scrutiny in the context of the $3.4 million in federal stimulus funds the company received. On his campaign website, Perdue says that ""our own government limits our options by being overtly hostile towards domestic energy producers."" Perdue and Rep. Jack Kingston (Ga.) will face off July 22 for the Republican nomination to take on the Democratic nominee, nonprofit executive Michelle Nunn.Perdue's connection to the utility company may not ultimately prove to be a vulnerability, however. A Kingston spokesman told The Huffington Post on Monday that though it is ""something conservatives would be interested in,"" he didn't know if the campaign has ""plans to highlight that over other items."""

The long awaited museum will open to the public on May 21 following a six-day dedication period for 9/11 families, survivors, first responders, workers, and local city residents. For the dedication period the doors to the museum will be open for 24-hours a day from May 15 through May 20. On Thursday President Barack Obama and the first lady will attend the dedication ceremony for the opening of the museum. While the construction of the museum has often been fraught with politics and controversy, the exhibitions and displays seek to pay tribute to the 2,983 victims of the 9/11 attacks and the 1993 bombing while also educating the public on the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e7bf240000500098aa73.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For months preceding the National September 11 Memorial Museum's grand opening in May, a seven-minute film to be installed at the museum, titled ""The Rise of al Qaeda,""  had provoked strong condemnation from Muslim advocates for its references to Islam.Such concerns were mostly dismissed by museum officials, who said they were ""satisfied"" with the film's ""objective"" message. But less than two weeks into the museum's opening, the New York Times reports tourists are echoing clergy members' concerns over language in the film -- one that critics say misrepresents terrorism and Islam as one. 22-year-old Adrian Cabreros, who was visiting from San Francisco, told the Times the film ""kind of gives Islam a bad vibe."" “I think they should have talked about Islam more, just so people understand that there is a difference between Islam and people who do terrorist attacks but who also happen to be Islamic,” Cabreros told the Times while visiting from San Francisco. “They just sort of said that the people from Al Qaeda wanted to have a more Islamic state, but it was hard to distinguish, to separate Islam itself.""Ben Schwecke, a 67-year-old veteran, missed the section of the museum devoted to al Qaeda but said the museum as a whole “did not really make clear that this is a fringe organization that really has corrupted much of the Quran."" The ostensible purpose of ""The Rise of al Qaeda,"" which is narrated by NBC's Brian Williams, is to explore the history of al Qaeda leading up to the attacks on September 11th. But after previewing the film, groups including the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on officials to drop it, alleging the film's narrative is ultimately harmful to the conversation surrounding Islam. ""Generations of visitors to this facility will be influenced by the contents of the displays and the presentations,"" CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said in April. ""It's going to be very important how Islam and the American Muslim community are portrayed.""Since it opened, negative press surrounding the museum has been largely directed at questionable offerings sold at the gift shop -- criticism that eventually prompted officials to cease selling commemorative cheese plates in the shape of the United States. It remains to be seen if the museum will be moved to make a similar adjustment in the wake of mounting criticism of ""The Rise of al Qaeda"" from visitors. After all, it's tourists who shell out the $24 admission fee to keep the museum afloat. "

But on Monday, a new mailer touting his tough stance on immigration cited a report that at least one of Cantor's staffers on Capitol Hill has disputed.The mailer plays up Cantor's role in blocking the passage of the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill, which his campaign refers to as the ""Obama-Reid plan to give illegal aliens amnesty."" As evidence, it cites an Associated Press article last month about immigration activists ""increasingly focusing their ire at one person: Eric Cantor, the House majority leader."" An activist in the same story dubbed Cantor the ""No. 1 guy standing between the American people and immigration reform"" -- something his campaign seems to wear as a badge of honor.But Rory Cooper, a spokesman for Cantor's congressional office, previously had taken issue with the same report and implied over Twitter that it was planted by Democratic staffers to make his boss look bad:This isn't the first effort by Cantor's campaign to throw some red meat to the GOP base in the lead-up to his primary, where he faces economics professor Dave Brat. Last week, Cantor's campaign sent a mailer that also struck a harsh tone on immigration.Back in Washington, Cantor's office has pushed back on the notion that he is against immigration reform. As examples, aides have cited his continued support for policies that would grant legal status to undocumented immigrants who enlist in the military, as well as legislation that would grant citizenship to kids brought to the country illegally.Although Cantor is likely to win his primary, the need for his campaign to strike a more conservative tone underscores the ongoing tussle between establishment Republicans and tea party candidates. Brat has positioned himself to the right of Cantor on several issues, including immigration.Update: June 3 -- Cooper confirmed in an email to The Huffington Post that Cantor's office disagreed with aspects of the AP story, but he declined to comment on its use in the campaign mailers.""Our issue with the article was two-fold -- [firstly,] their reporting techniques which included originally listing political strategists as advocates which they updated,"" Cooper said.

In five out of the last six months, in fact, Obama's numbers have gotten better. He is now roughly where he was right before the impact of the Obamacare website rollout hit his approval rating. This is still not fantastic territory for any president's approval rating to be in, but it does represent a steady increase as Obama has won back people he lost in the Obamacare website disaster. However, this trend may now be flattening out, meaning June's numbers may not be as positive. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's start with a look at last month's chart:[Click on graph to see larger-scale version.]May 2014May started with some very positive economic news, as the unemployment rate fell sharply, from 6.7 to 6.3 percent. Primary season got under way in May, but the news was mostly on the Republican side and didn't affect Obama's numbers much. Republicans seemed to realize last month that their election campaign strategy (which consisted solely of ""Obamacare stinks!"") was no longer going to be enough, and they tried to shift attention to old scandals instead, announcing the eighth investigation (to date) over Benghazi. Republicans also seem to have pivoted somewhat towards directing their wrath at Hillary Clinton rather than the president, as an early preview of what the 2016 contest will be like.Obama suffered a serious political setback in May, as he was forced to essentially fire one of his cabinet members -- something no president ever enjoys doing. But whatever you think of Eric Shinseki's culpability in the Veterans Administration scandal, politically he had to go. The V.A. hospital story loomed all month long, until a scathing interim report came out which hastened Shinseki's exit. While Republicans were attempting to focus on Benghazi, Obama provided them with a new scandal instead. This, so far, hasn't hurt Obama much in the polls, but it may do so next month as the details of how bad the situation is trickle out.Obama, toward the end of the month, exhibited a burst of activity which is still continuing. He announced the end of America's longest war, giving a timetable for troop withdrawals from Afghanistan (which is a wildly popular idea with the general public, it's worth noting). He gave a foreign policy speech to a graduating military academy. Last week, the White House leaked some of the particulars of the new E.P.A. pollution rules Obama unveiled formally today, which amounts to a major policy shift on greenhouse gas emissions -- possibly the most significant since Richard Nixon created the E.P.A., in fact. And on the last days of the month, Obama announced the prisoner-of-war swap which gained the release of the only American soldier held by the Taliban. These last two will affect Obama's poll numbers in June, perhaps, but came so late in May that the polling really didn't have time to react. So it's anyone's guess how the public will ultimately see them.Obama's average monthly job approval rating rose 0.6 percent in May, hitting 44.0 percent. Job disapproval fell to 51.7 percent in May, a drop of 0.4 percent. In five of the last six months, Obama has managed to improve his job approval rating. One thing worth noting in this time period is that Obama's ""undecided"" numbers have been about one percent lower than normal. During his first term, the undecided stat spent most months in the 5-to-6 percent range, while for most of his second term he's been more in the 4-to-5.5 percent range. In May, his undecided number was at 4.3 percent, and it hasn't been as high as 5.0 percent since October. Some good news for Obama in his ""underwater"" number (disapproval minus approval), as he is down from a high of a 12.5 percent gap last November to only a 7.7 percent difference in May. That shows marked improvement (a full percent last month alone), and this number is now within the range of Obama's first term. But, a note of caution, this only means that Obama's polling now is slightly better than the worst polling he saw during his entire first term.Overall TrendsObama's job approval monthly average is now back to where it was before October of last year, when the Obamacare website appeared. His disapproval average still lags about a point from where he was back then, though, so he hasn't completely climbed out of this hole yet. Here's a magnified view of Obama's past year, to better show this movement:[Click on graph to see larger-scale version.]In September of 2013, Obama's average monthly job approval was 43.9 percent. It now stands at 44.0 percent, up from a low of 41.4 percent in November. However, his disapproval average stood at 50.8 percent in September, and now stands at 51.7 percent -- almost a full point higher (this is where the movement has been from the undecideds, to put it another way). So he hasn't fully recovered all the damage the Obamacare website rollout did, although his approval rate has indeed recovered fully.Obama's numbers each improved roughly half a percent in May, continuing the trend which began after Obama announced the website was working (at the beginning of December). His approval rate has improved 2.6 percent over the last six months, while his disapproval improved 2.2 percent. However, this trend may be slowing or even coming to an end.Within May, Obama stayed remarkably steady, as both his daily job approval and disapproval averages (from RealClearPolitics.com's daily ""poll of polls"") only fluctuated 1.2 percentage points each. This is historically very low, as these numbers usually bounce around quite a bit more. He started the month at a low of 43.4 percent daily approval, rose within a week or so to a high of 44.6 percent, and then stayed within that range for the rest of the month. His disapproval averages showed a slower improvement, from 52.1 percent early in the month to 50.9 percent towards the end.But the last week of May showed a downturn, which may be significant and may not. Obama finished the month at 43.6 percent daily approval and 52.0 percent daily disapproval -- both numbers worse than what he charted overall for May. One recent poll (Reuters) only gave Obama 38 percent approval, which is currently bringing his average down. But it may be just an outlier poll -- all the others show Obama in much better position, roughly in the 43-44 percent range. If it is just one bad poll, then Obama's numbers will recover in June, but if it is the indication of a new downward trend, then Obama's positive trend may come to an end this month.This could take the form of a leveling out of Obama's numbers, roughly where they were before the Obamacare rollout. Or it could even signal a new downturn, as the V.A. scandal unfolds and Republicans rake over Benghazi once again. The unemployment numbers come out at the end of the week, which could help Obama's public approval, if the news is positive. But the safe money, at this point, is that Obama's approval levels out in June and ends the slow improvement he's shown for the last six months, at least for now.[Obama Poll Watch Data:]Sources And MethodologyObamaPollWatch.com is an admittedly amateur effort, but we do try to stay professional when it comes to revealing our sources and methodology.
