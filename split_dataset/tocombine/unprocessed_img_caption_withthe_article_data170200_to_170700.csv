Place baby potatoes (skin on) in pot and cover with cold water, add a quarter pound of the butter and a large pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then turn down to medium-low and poach the potatoes until tender. Do not overcook. Once cooked, strain from the liquid and while still warm, use a kitchen rag and gently rub potatoes to remove skin, leaving potato intact. Set aside.Peel Yukon gold potatoes, then cut three of them into eight pieces each and place them in a pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until tender. While potatoes are cooking, place half and half in a sauce pot along with a half pound of butter and bring to a simmer, then remove from heat. Once the potatoes are cooked, strain them from the water and pass them through a food mill. Fold in the butter/half and half mixture to make a smooth puree. Adjust seasoning with salt. Puree should be velvety smooth with no lumps. Keep warm.Take remaining potatoes and slice them paper-thin on a mandoline. Overlap slices on a baking sheet and brush with two tablespoons melted butter. Place in oven and bake until slightly caramelized and crispy. Let cool. Break into four two-by-two potato ""shards."" Set aside.Place one tablespoon of butter into a sauté pan and gently sauté mushrooms with a pinch of salt until the butter begins to brown. Add the white wine and turn up the heat up to reduce and glaze the mushrooms. Transfer to a paper towel and adjust seasoning if necessary. Add zest and juice of one lemon to the crème fraiche, and adjust seasoning with salt if necessary.To assemble the tartlet: Place a small dollop of crème fraiche in the center of the plate. Place potato ""shard"" on the crème fraiche. Re-warm new potatoes and slowly add ingredients on the potato ""shard,"" layering new potatoes and mushrooms, potato puree, crème fraiche, and watercress. Garnish with remaining watercress and thin slices of the winter truffle.MAIN COURSE:  Hand-Cut Pappardelle, Fall Squash, Lacinato Kale, Hazelnuts, Brown Butter (serves 4)  Pasta dough:  16 egg yolks 2 cups flourUsing a large mixing bowl, add flour and make a well in the center. Place yolks in the well, and, using your fingers, moving in a clockwise circle, slowly drag the flour into the yolk a little at a time. Once the dough begins to come together (it will look messy but don't fret), turn all ingredients out onto a lightly floured work surface. Using both hands now, press all the flour into dough. Using the heel of your palm, gently knead the dough until it becomes elastic and shiny. Form it into a ball, press it into a flat disk, and cut it in half. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 375° FSauce:  2 butternut squash 2 bunches, Lacinato kale 1 pound hazelnuts, toasted 1 pound whole unsalted butter ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil ¼ cup canola oil 1 garlic clove  ¼ cup grated Grana Padano (or Parmesan)Split the butternut squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Place in a roasting pan along with a half pound of butter, cover bottom of roasting pan with water and cover everything with foil. Place in the oven and roast until soft, about one hour. Using a spoon, remove the flesh from the skin and place in a blender. Puree on high speed until completely smooth. Pass through a strainer and set aside.Blanch Kale in a large pot of boiling, salted water until tender. Strain and place in an ice bath to preserve color. Place kale in a blender with garlic, Grana Padano, one pound of the hazelnuts and both oils. Puree on high until completely smooth. Adjust seasoning with salt.Roll pasta out on pasta crank, starting at zero, finishing on six. Fold the pasta sheet over itself and cut into ¾-inch strips. Warm ¼ cup of the butternut puree in a sauté pan large enough to hold the pasta as well. Blanch the pappardelle in a large pot of salted, boiling water for three minutes. Transfer to sauté pan. Over medium heat, add two tablespoons of butter to glaze the pasta. Just before removing pasta from the pan, add ¼ cup of the kale pesto and gently toss to coat. Place a small dollop of butternut puree in four medium bowls. Twirl pappardelle and rest on top of the puree. Sprinkle remaining toasted hazelnuts on top to garnish and finish with additional Grana Padano.DESSERT:  Chocolate Pot de Crème (serves 6 to 8)   2 cups whole milk 1 tablespoon cocoa powder 5 ounces dark chocolate (preferably 70 percent) 4 egg yolks 1 whole egg ⅓ cup sugar Pinch saltBring milk and cocoa powder to a boil. Dissolve chocolate into hot milk, blend with an immersion, being careful not to incorporate too much air. In a separate bowl, combine remaining ingredients, temper in to hot milk/chocolate mixture. Strain through a fine mesh sieve. Distribute into individual oven-safe ramekins or bowls. Bake in a covered water bath in a preheated 300° F oven for 30 minutes or until set.Peanut butter crumble (this yields a lot, but can also be used to form cookies):  ¾ cups butter, room temperature ½ cup peanut butter ½ cup brown sugar ¼ cup teaspoon vanilla extract 2¼ cup all-purpose flour ¼ teaspoon saltIn a mixer using the paddle attachment, cream together first four ingredients until fluffy. Add remaining ingredients and mix only until combined (mixture should be crumbly). Crumble mixture onto sheet pan and bake at 300° F for 15 minutes.Peanut butter cream (yields 1 half-pint siphon):  ½ cup peanut butter ½ cup water 2 teaspoons sugar 1 cup heavy creamWhisk together all ingredients until smooth.

3,FOOD & DRINK,10 Food Budgeting Tips I Wish I Followed Religiously,"Laura Kumin, Contributor

These tips are for the rest of us.,2012-12-03,"FILE- In this Wednesday, May 9, 2012, file photo, David Lee shops at a Costco Wholesale store, in Portland, Ore. U.S. wholesale companies added modestly to their stockpiles in May. But sales at the wholesale level dropped by the largest amount in three years, a troubling sign for future growth. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c92d126000032007f8835.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I had young kids and a full-time job, our dinner rotation varied only slightly from week to week. Being on autopilot was not exciting, but it took a lot less time and thought than planning new meals. It had another advantage; it kept our food budget relatively stable. Those days are long gone; now my food choices and budget can be all over the map. There are weeks when we eat yogurt or eggs for dinner two or three nights and that sure keeps our food budget down, and other times when I save almost by accident because I've got a hankering for simple soups or stews made from beans, vegetables, and a bit of meat. On the other hand, if I'm not careful, I can spend a bundle making dinners with exotic -- and expensive -- ingredients.Those who carefully plan every meal and shop as if it were a chess game hardly need my advice. These tips are for the rest of us.My Top 10 Food Budgeting Tips 10. Don't lose track of the small items - They add up. Meals that require many ingredients you don't have on hand may be expensive, even if no single item is costly. On the flip side, saving a little on many items adds up too even though you might not notice if you just look only each item separately.9. Shop the sales - Paying retail when you don't have to is what I call a ""secular sin."" If you are flexible enough in meal planning to take advantage of the sales, you'll save a bundle and still eat well. For example, fennel is normally a bit pricey, so you may not cook with it regularly. But when it's on sale, this shaved fennel salad is a quick and delicious dinner treat. 8. Don't buy something (especially large quantities) just because the item is on sale - Do you have boxes or cans of food that sit unused in your pantry because you bought them on sale and now you cannot remember why you thought that was such a good idea? Enough said. 7. Buy in bulk, but only when it makes sense - Often purchasing in larger quantities saves money, but not always. If the bulk item is less expensive and you can use or store it, then the purchase makes sense. I buy sun-dried tomatoes in bulk. They are much less expensive when sold that way, they store well in the pantry, and I make a simple pasta sauce/appetizer with them that freezes well. But sometimes bulk items aren't much cheaper by the ounce or pound than smaller quantities. Moreover, I try not to go overboard on fresh foods that spoil before I can finish them or grains that I use only infrequently. 6. Don't overbuy  - Those of us who tend to be overly ambitious shoppers have to learn to restrain our urge to buy quantities we are not likely to use. Wasting food is not just bad on a personal level; it's a shame at a time when so many in the world go hungry. 5. Consider price per portion, not price per pound - Small portions of a relatively expensive cut of meat or type of fish can be just as budget conscious as larger portions of a cheaper cut or type. For example, flank steak is more expensive than chuck per pound, but thin slices of flank steak nicely arrayed on a plate with roasted vegetables may be no more expensive than a stew made with chuck steak. 4. Plan reasonable portion sizes for meals. By now it's a cliché that French women are thinner than their British and American counterparts (and others too, I'm sure) because they tend to exercise better portion control. This post is about budget, not clothing size, but the same portion control philosophy is a money-saver too. Conserve your budget dollars as well as your waistline with modest portions of food.3. Plan meals and list ingredients before shopping. On weeks when I plan all our dinners, make a list of required ingredients and stick to it when I shop, adjusting only for sales I didn't know about before I went shopping, I give myself a medal. 2. Save receipts for a month and look at patterns. The first step in understanding how to save money is to look at your actual spending. If you find mistakes and patterns, learn from them instead of remaining blissfully unaware that you spend much more than you intend.  1. Eat before you grocery shop (i.e. don't go food shopping when you are hungry.) My mother's rule and a good one at that. If I hear my stomach growl as I enter the store, all is not lost -- provided that I buy a piece of fruit to eat before moving onto the aisles of prepared food and other tempting items that weren't on my shopping list."

On a cutting board.",2012-12-03,"BERLIN, GERMANY - DECEMBER 21: Traditional, home-made Christmas cookies lie on plates in a household on December 21, 2010 in Berlin, Germany. Christmas cookies are an intrinsic part of Central European Christmas tradition and are usually baked at home according to recipes passed down through generations. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8f952400005000533eb6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I'm a designer, and I travel a lot, which means I am constantly inspired. On recent trips to Ireland and Argentina, I was reminded of an entertaining idea that is brilliant in its simplicity. Call it hors d'oeuvres, aperitivos or appetizers; it's so easy you don't even have to cook. It's all about delicious ingredients and a great presentation.On a cutting board.  There's a version for everyone. In Argentina, at an estancia outside of Buenos Aires (read about it on my blog), I was served meat and cheese with homemade breadsticks artfully arranged on top. At Avoca Café in Dublin, the platter was a vegetarian one, with several spreads and grilled bread.Not to be outdone, I've come up with a holiday sweets version, using store-bought cookies, candies, nuts and berries. Serve before or after (in the case of the sweets) a formal (or informal) dinner, or on its own for a cocktail party. It all goes on a cutting board, or two or three, befitting the size of your crowd. This is meant to be a no-stress concept, but I have one style rule: each ingredient should be grouped in its own row or section. It just looks better that way, trust my designer's eye.Here's a list of potential ingredients. Use any or all, depending upon what you like, what's in season or what's available in your local market. Prepare items in sizes that are easy to pick up with a toothpick or by hand.Savories BoardMeat: sliced, cured varieties such as salami, sopressata, prosciutto, prosciutto cotto (cooked ham), bresaola, mortadella, saucisson or pepperoni. If you feel like you have to cook something, consider grilling up sausages or skewers of chicken or steak.Cheese: sliced, cubed or bite-size wedges of brie, gouda, havarti, provolone, gorgonzola, pecorino, cheddar or fresh mozzarella.Vegetables: grilled zucchini, eggplant, roasted red yellow peppers, blanched asparagus, marinated artichoke hearts, peppadew peppers, grape or cherry tomatoes, cucumbers or pickles. The board I had in Dublin had salad greens in the center, which looked pretty but wouldn't be practical for this purpose.Additionally: olives (I usually put in small bowls on the board), figs (halved lengthwise), spreads such as hummus, tabouli, tapenade, tzatziki (in small bowls with spoons.) Add a small glass or tiny cup of toothpicks for self-service.Bread: breadsticks, crusty rolls, baguette (sliced diagonally), grilled rustic bread or assorted crackers.Sweets BoardBoth my mother and grandmother have traditionally baked at least a dozen different variations of Christmas cookies and candies. If you are like them and have home-baked goods, arrange them on a board and serve. As I didn't inherit the baking gene, I shopped.I've kept the color scheme to red, white and chocolate for the holidays. My cutting board is placed on a vintage French tea towel that I found in Paris, but you can find new versions of them at places like Ikea and Williams-Sonoma. You'll also need small cups or bowls if you don't already own them, Anthropologie has little latte bowls that are perfect. Now for the sweets. This is what I came up with in my local grocery store:In small bowls, with a spoon for serving: spiced almonds, toffee-coated peanuts, chocolate-covered almonds. In mini-cupcake baking cups: three different types of fudge (chocolate espresso, vanilla walnut and fruit and nut)Baked Goods: Locally baked shortbread, biscotti, and biscotti ""bites"", and Williams-Sonoma peppermint bark chocolate wafer cookiesAdditionally: I found these dark chocolate cups at the grocery store, filled them with blueberries, raspberries and blackberries, and put a small bowl of whipped cream, with a spoon, alongside the board, for a topping.Candy canes in a small glass (or you could use a bud vase) add height and a festive touch to the board. These are Starburst strawberry-flavored. (I liked that they were monochromatic, but you can use regular red and white ones if you want.)Be creative in arranging your board, and prepare to impress your guests with the presentation!To see where I get my inspiration, check out my blog."

Is there anything the Olsen sisters can't do??But the powerful design duo have now outdone themselves. The Row has teamed with Damien Hirst for a backpack collection, announced by e-retailer Just One Eye. The collab is a ""fascinating study in contrasts"" whereby The Row's Nile crocodile leather bag is covered in gold polka dots, rainbow polka dots and prescription pills. The various embellishments are signature Hirst, referencing the artist's famous Spot paintings and his pill-covered piece, ""The Void.""With just 12 bags created, a portion of the sale of each bag will benefit UNICEF.

8,DIVORCE,The Sleeper Effect,"Terry Gaspard, Contributor

These same girls may grow into womanhood and become particularly vulnerable to fears and anxieties about the future -- just as they are forming their own romantic relationships.,2012-12-03,Alone beautiful woman sitting on window and looking on night city,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8e0d26000033007f8645.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the last three decades, I've been studying divorce -- both from a personal and professional perspective. But in reality, I wasn't truly prepared to help my daughter, Tracy, heal from the pain caused by my own divorce. I was blindsided by a powerful psychological phenomenon that impacts many daughters of divorce known as the ""sleeper effect."" Finally out of desperation, I went back to the books that had been collecting dust on my shelves so that I could examine my own patterns of behavior in intimate relationships and help Tracy make healthier choices in romantic partners.What exactly is the ""sleeper effect?"" Judith Wallerstein, a pioneer in the area of divorce research, studied dozens of young women who appeared to be suffering from a delayed reaction to their parents' breakup. As children, they had done their best to be ""good girls"" and played the hand of cards that divorce dealt them. Wallerstein noted that while boys tend to have a more immediate adverse reaction to their parents' breakup, girls usually identify with their mothers and appear to be coping fairly well.Studies show that girls are socialized by their mothers to be more obedient and responsible than boys. Dr. Linda Nielsen, found that girls tend to spend more time with their mothers (and less time with dad) than boys after their parents' divorce. It makes sense that girls are more likely to worry about their mother's adjustment and may conceal their emotions -- appearing to others as if everything is okay.The breakup of a family may signify the loss of childhood for girls. These same girls may grow into womanhood and become particularly vulnerable to fears and anxieties about the future -- just as they are forming their own romantic relationships. When they fall in love, it reawakens long-hidden fears they tried to bury in childhood. Most daughters of divorce have trouble with trust and intimacy and fear that no matter what they do, they will be left. Consequently, they tend to pick partners who are all wrong for them and/or lack confidence in their ability to make love last.The results of Wallerstein's twenty-five year landmark study were coming into focus when I realized that my own daughter, Tracy, was struggling in romantic relationships as a young woman. While her dad and I tried to have a ""good divorce,"" we certainly didn't model healthy communication or marital endurance. While Tracy's transition in womanhood was marked by many successes including graduating from college, she began to doubt herself and was apprehensive about love and commitment as she was attempting to create adult relationships of her own.Meanwhile, while shopping for used books at my local library, I picked up a copy of Mary Pipher's book, Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls and I felt as if I was struck by a lightning bolt. I realized that psychologists and therapists alike had been ignoring adolescent girls all along and that they really do slowly bury their authentic selves as they enter adolescence. According to Pipher, ""Girls become female impersonators who fit their whole selves into small crowded spaces. Vibrant, confident girls become shy, doubting young woman. Girls stop thinking, ""Who am I? What do I want?"" and start thinking ""What must I do to please others?"" Then it hit me, while in the midst of my own crisis as a mother -- many girls seem to breeze through their parents' breakup during childhood. Often they submissively accept their parents' divorce. This is due to our tendency, as females, to repress unpleasant feelings. I believe most parents and therapists underestimate the powerful effects of a disrupted family on the social and emotional development of girls. We minimize the pressure and expectations they feel as they try to distance themselves from their parents -- especially their moms -- at a time when their sense of trust, love and security is fractured. Just as a girl is grappling with her complicated relationship with her mother -- filled with love, longing, and both closeness and distance, she has the added stress of dealing with her parents' divorce. Meanwhile, she is questioning where she stands with the first love in her life -- her father -- who may be distant, absent, or preoccupied with his new life since most parents remarry within six years after a divorce.Like all challenges in life, greater awareness and willingness to work on an issue can spark change. Armed with insight into the root of their relationship struggles, most daughters of divorce can and do improve. Tracy and I developed a website that is designed to facilitate healing and to help daughters raised in divided homes restore their faith in love.What can a daughter of divorce do to cope with the ""sleeper effect?""- Accept that your parents' divorce impacted your view of relationships but doesn't have to define your choices in romantic partners.- Gain awareness about your parents' divorce. This might mean interviewing your parents, family members, or trusted friends. Keeping a journal or talking to friends can help you come to terms with your past and present situation.- Write down three crucial ways that your parents' divorce has impacted (or is still impacting) your life. Seeking the help of a therapist and/or reading articles and blogs may be helpful.- Set three personal goals to address these issues if the effects were (or are) negative. Visualize yourself in an open and honest romantic relationship. Put together a vision board or write down what you want your relationship to look like. Make it a point to reflect on this image several times each day.- Develop self-trust and extend trust to partners who demonstrate through their words and deeds that they are trustworthy. Trust is the basis of all healthy intimate relationships.- Attempt to forgive others and move on from the past. Try to see your parents' breakup from their perspective. Forgiveness doesn't mean condoning hurtful behavior -- it simply has less power over you.Follow Terry Gaspard on Twitter and Facebook."

The retailer provides small business loans at its Sam's Club stores, but doesn't offer mortgages.A spokesman for PayPal Inc, a subsidiary of online auction site eBay Inc, said it offers credit lines for customer purchases, but hasn't announced any plans to move into the mortgage business. BASIC BANKING BACK IN STYLEIt's not unheard of, though, for retailers to enter the mortgage business. In late 2011, warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp began offering home loans online through select lenders. The company doesn't disclose loan volume, but the service has gone well, said Jay Smith, Costco's director of financial services.""We have tried to make it a service where members see significant value on rates and fees,"" Smith said.While the Carlisle & Gallagher survey found that 80 percent of U.S. consumers would consider a mortgage from a non-bank, there was a bright spot for traditional banks. Seventy percent of respondents said they would prefer to have their mortgage with one of their main banks, although only 39 percent currently do so.Two-thirds of respondents said the high cost of getting a loan was the most painful aspect of the mortgage application process, followed by slow execution (56 percent) and poor communication with the lender (32 percent).""Banks have a captive audience, and have folks who are willing and wanting to do business with them,"" Hautop said. ""It means it's time to go back to the basics for our banks.""In the past year, banks, including Wells Fargo & Co and JPMorgan Chase & Co, have benefited from surging consumer demand to refinance their mortgages at low interest rates. But in the coming year, refinancings are forecast to decline, so banks will need to focus more on serving customers taking out loans to purchase homes, Hautop said. "

(AP Photo/Alan Diaz)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c920c2500003300361e56.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The National Basketball Association (NBA) has always been a league relatively free of performance-enhancing scandals. While there have been a few players who have failed drug testing, these players were not big names, and the issue came and went without much notice.   That streak ended abruptly Thursday night with three of the biggest names in the game -- Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili (as well as Danny Green) -- being busted for performance-enhancing endeavors. To add fuel to this fire, not only were all four players from the same organization, the San Antonio Spurs, but their head coach freely admits to leading them down this dark path himself. ""It's the best thing for our team,"" Head Coach Gregg Popovich stated. Incredibly, he went on to admit that the team has done it before. As one would imagine, Commissioner David Stern quickly promised ""substantial"" sanctions, and he delivered in the form of a $250,000 fine. So what steroid injection, doping agent, or banned substance is at the center of this major story?The answer is sleep.That's right. As unbelievable as this may sound, the Spurs simply decided to rest their players, and they were punished severely for it. Why would a team decide to do such a thing? Let's take a look at the facts. All teams play an 82-game schedule, and for older players, particularly during the second half of the season, that gets to be an exhausting grind. The Spurs were at the end of a brutal six-game road trip (winning the first five) and currently own the third-best record in the entire league. Why not send your key players home, let them get over their jetlag a little sooner, and get more rest before their next game? What advantage do you gain by subjecting these guys to a physical away game against the defending NBA champion Miami Heat?To succeed at a high level in any athletic endeavor, you must be able to not only perform at a high level, but also recover at a high level as well. Recovery from intense athletic activity is a multifactorial process. One key to recovery is growth hormone. We all make growth hormone and it helps strengthen our bones, repair muscle tissue, and promote a healthy immune system. Obviously, the use of illegal growth hormone is found within sports as athletes use these types of substances to gain an advantage. What is interesting is that most adult men only secrete natural growth hormone when they are in deep sleep.[1]The Spurs are an older team. Tim, Tony, and Manu are 36, 30, and 35 respectively (compare that to the ages of the main three of the Oklahoma City Thunder that beat them in four straight games last year in the Western Conference Finals: Kevin Durant -- 24, Russell Westbrook -- 24, and James Harden -- 23). So what does age matter? Consider the fact that as we mature, we tend exhibit less deep sleep as we snooze at night.[2] So by transitive property, if growth hormone helps an athlete recover, and growth hormone is secreted in deep sleep, then deep sleep helps an athlete recover. Furthermore, if deep sleep is harder to come by in an older athlete, then it stands to reason that taking extra care of an older athlete's sleep might help them recover more effectively and be a better athlete -- performance enhancement at its best!How can we promote deep sleep and better growth hormone secretion? Doing this requires understanding the factors that disrupt deep sleep. Shift work and schedule disruption are huge factors that disturb sleep, which should come as no surprise to anyone. Working unusual hours or traveling across time zones (jetlag) can reduce or disrupt deep sleep, thus affecting growth hormone levels.[3] Imagine how much better 6'11"" Tim Duncan sleeps in his own bed, rather than crammed into some hotel bed or trying to catch some essential rest on a charter plane.   I understand that the fans of the Spurs vs. Heat game may have been disappointed not the see the San Antonio stars on the court, but this is not new to sports. Players in the National Football League and Major League Baseball are routinely rested in a strategic fashion. (Don't believe me? Tune into the December 30 game between the Atlanta Falcons and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. I wouldn't be surprised if the Falcons allowed their more athletic fans to suit up.) Since when do we get guarantees with anything sport-related? On top of that, the game ended up being extremely competitive.In a world where winning is everything and coaches get fired quickly for not delivering trophies, I could not agree more with Popovich's move (especially since he had to host the Memphis Grizzlies, possibly the best team in the league, two days later). As someone who studies the effects of sleep on elite athletes, I am shocked that more teams do not strategically rest their key players in the midst of these long and compact seasons (this was the Spurs' fourth game in five nights). Commissioner Stern, in my opinion, is wrong for meddling with the right a team has to get the most out of their investments. Earlier this year the Washington Nationals made a similarly bold move to rest their ace pitcher Stephen Strasburg permanently at the end of the season. Instead of a quarter of a million dollar fine, the Nationals manager received something a little different for his decision.He received the 2012 National League Manager of the Year.For more by Dr. Christopher Winter, click here.For more healthy living health news, click here.For more on sleep, click here.References:[1] Van Cauter E, Kerkhofs M, Caufriez A, Van Onderbergen A, Thorner MO, Copinschi G.
