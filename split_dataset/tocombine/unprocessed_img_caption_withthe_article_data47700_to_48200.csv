It's one thing to experience those iconic black-out nights in college, but it's another to dance the night away under the glow of a full moon on a secluded island on the islands of Cambodia. Oh, the world is full of such exotic splendors and immersing yourself in culture will (in cliche travel-writing form) change your perspective blah blah and change your life blah blah and you'll be addicted blah. It would be wrong to leave out though, that part of immersing yourself in a different culture is experiencing how the locals let loose and live it up. Whether it's a New Year's celebration that is actually a giant water gun fight or a gathering to watch a wooden giant go up in wild flames in the Nevada desert; letting your inner beast out to play while traveling can be good for the soul and you'll leave with outrageous stories to tell the kids one day...or maybe it's a good idea to bury some of those stories deep, deep down within your loins where no one can uncover them. Move over Full Moon Party and Coachella. From fashion to vegetable flinging and music festivals to national holidays, take a sneak peek at how the world parties hard and perhaps you animals may find yourself at one for your next international escapade. Songkran FestivalTwo words: water gun. That is, you'll need one for this water fight held throughout all of Thailand from April 13-15. On a serious note, this is the Thai New Year celebration, where water is poured on the hands of elders as a symbol of respect and cleansing. It has over time though, become a wet n' wild party, with locals and tourists lining streets with buckets of ice water and super soakers. No one is immune to the cleansing, so leave your electronics and whiny ""Don't you dare wet me, I just caked on makeup"" attitude at the hotel. Where can you soak up the fun? Bangkok, Phuket and Chiang Mai boast some of the biggest parties.Mercedes-Benz Fashion WeekFor all of the fashionistas out there, dip your fingers into some of the poshest parties, runway shows and events during a fabulous week that celebrates style and culture worldwide. Don your trendiest threads and scamper on over to Berlin, Istanbul or Sydney to be engulfed by the boldest looks and freshest clothing lines to hit the industry. Even if fashion isn't your thing, it's a thrilling way to get a taste of the creative ingenuity that goes into the festivities and bump elbows with the beautiful people, with parties organized by the top dogs in the promotional business.King's Day (Formerly Queen's Day)Amsterdam is the city to be on April 27, when the Dutch honor King Willem-Alexander with a national celebration. The party is held nation-wide, but Amsterdam is the popular spot, where a street party of epic proportions takes place. There's plenty of live music all over the city and various art events to explore. The infamous canals are jam packed with boats and those boats are jam packed with peeps. Don't forget to wear orange- the national color of the Netherlands.La TomatinaIf you've ever dreamed of splattering people in the face with fruits without getting punched in the face in return or getting grounded by the parents, then this is the party for you. Travel to Buñol in eastern Spain, where 175 tonnes of ripe n' ready tomatoes are supplied for the world's largest food fight. For this festival, a gun fires and the tomato tossing begins. The sun shines, streets run red with vitamin C and the celebrations are non stop until the pistol fires once more to signal a close to the friendly gathering of tomato flinging. Burning Man Festival Burning Man, where strange and beautiful souls- the best kind of souls- gather in the heart of Nevada's Black Rock Desert to create a special community of around 30,000 people. Taking place in August or September, attendees must contribute something to the festival in accordance with the year's theme. Don't you dare try to use cash or card resources- the name of the game is to barter. Let your inhibitions explode out in the barren dust and sand and take in the magnificent artistic creations that seem to come to life when the moon and stars rule the heavens. The grand finale of the fest is a massive wooden figure that towers over the landscape, set ablaze for all to watch and reflect. Boryeong Mud FestivalIf it's not a water or tomato fight you're after, maybe you're one of those that just need to get down and dirty, like plastered from head to toe in mud dirty. In the small town of Boryeong in South Korea, there's a festival lasting around two weeks long to quench that mucky thirst. What began in 1999 as a way to promote the cosmetic benefits of the beach town's mineral packed glop, soon turned into one of the most popular annual parties, drawing international visitors in hordes. It's simple: show up, mud, get drunk, mud and mud it up some more until you and everyone around you is covered in, you guessed it, mud."

2,FIFTY,5 Reasons Why North American Retirees Are Flocking To Mexico,"Suzan Haskins and Dan Prescher, ContributorInternationalLiving.com Editors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/retire-in-mexico_b_11594580.html,"Current estimates put the number of U.S. and Canadian citizens living in various places in Mexico at well over one million.

Not all are retired, but hundreds of thousands of them are.  Beach in Cancun, Mexico This easily makes Mexico the world's most popular overseas retirement destination for U.S. and Canadian citizens.Remember, this is the country that one U.S. presidential candidate thinks is so bad that it should be walled off from the rest of North America.What makes so many North Americans disagree? What makes Mexico the world's biggest draw for U.S. and Canadian citizens looking outside their own countries for a quality retirement?We can think of five reasons off the top of our heads.The Weather -- The only place you'll find snow in Mexico is on the tops of mountains. Otherwise, the weather in the entire country is temperate to hot. Mexico's Pacific, Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf Coast beaches are justifiably famous for their warmth and beauty, and in Mexico's interior highlands, you'll find dozens of communities where North America retirees enjoy warm days and cool nights all year around. No snow to shovel, ever.  Outdoor Cafe in Merida, Mexico  Proximity to U.S. and Canada -- Mexico is the nearest neighbor to the U.S. and one country away from Canada. This makes getting back home for any reason quick, simple, and affordable. There are hundreds of direct flights from major airports in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta, Merida, Cancun, and other Mexican hubs to major U.S. cities every day. (And more are coming. The U.S. and Mexico just signed a treaty to allow even more direct flights between even more cities in the two countries.) And much of Mexico is close enough that many U.S. and Canadian retirees drive to their Mexican winter quarters or second homes.Great Medical Care -- In Mexico's major metropolitan areas, medical facilities are world class, and medical care costs significantly less than in the U.S. And entrepreneurs in Mexico are fully aware of the draw that good medical care has for U.S. and Canadian retirees... New facilities are being built and older facilities upgraded throughout Mexico to cater to foreign retirees. Lower Cost of Living -- It can cost much less to live in Mexico than it does in the U.S. or Canada. Weather has a lot to do with this... If you live somewhere with mild, year-around weather, utility costs naturally go down. But other costs are lower as well, including health insurance and medical care, rents, and the cost of real estate. (Annual property taxes in Mexico are rarely more than $200.) There are certainly some areas of Mexico very popular with U.S. and Canadian tourists and retirees where prices are on par with those up north, but it doesn't take much looking once on the ground to find extremely reasonable rents and real estate prices outside the tourist and ""gringo"" zones. (By the way, the Mexican peso has been trading at close to 18 pesos to the U.S. dollar for some time now, making this the most affordable time in recent memory to be spending dollars in Mexico.)  Colorful Sidestreet in Tequisquiapan, Mexico Wonderful Cultures -- Mexico has its own brand identity, and even people who have never been anywhere in the country think they know what Mexico is like. But it's a big country, and the difference between the culture in Merida and the culture in Puerto Vallarta is as vast as the difference between Virginia Beach and Portland or Montreal and Vancouver. The music, the food, the clothing, the attitudes ... there is so much cultural variety that thinking of Mexico as nothing but mariachis and tacos is like thinking of the U.S. as nothing but hip hop and burgers or of Canada as nothing but Celine Dion and poutine. Mexicans are proud of their national heritage, but they are just as likely as other North Americans to think of themselves in terms of their city, region, or state as anything else.So it's no surprise to us that North American retirees have made Mexico their #1 destination. We've lived in three different communities in Mexico and have visited nearly every Mexican state, so the charms of Mexico are obvious to us.And let us hasten to add that we have rarely felt unsafe or in danger anywhere we've lived or traveled in Mexico.A number of factors have combined to cause terrible violence in some parts of the country, mostly due to conflicts over control of various aspects of the illegal drug trade. Having the largest and most profitable market on the planet for illegal drugs just across its northern border has not helped Mexico overcome its problems with drug-related crime.But we are not involved in the production, sale, and distribution of drugs, and neither are the vast majority of expats living and working in Mexico. Statistically, many areas of Mexico are safer than areas of comparable populations in the U.S. and Canada. Those are the areas we've lived in, and those are the areas most U.S. and Canadian retirees live in. Safely.So we guess there are actually six reasons that Mexico is the top destination for U.S. and Canadian citizens looking for a more affordable, high-quality retirement than they can get back home. And remember, Mexico is part of North America ... No wall will stop us from doing business with, retiring to, or enjoying the cultural richness and opportunities of our southern partner.

The 19th Amendment, which grants that right, was certified as law on Aug. 26, 1920.“Today, as we celebrate the anniversary of this hard-won achievement and pay tribute to the trailblazers and suffragists who moved us closer to a more just and prosperous future, we resolve to protect this constitutional right and pledge to continue fighting for equality for women and girls,” the president wrote.While Women’s Equality Day began as a celebration of women gaining an equal voice in the voting booth, the annual holiday has come to stand for women’s fight for equality on a range of issues. Obama recapped his administration’s contributions to that fight, from signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and pushing for lower health care premiums for women through the Affordable Care Act, to hosting forums for women in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields and putting on the first United State of Women Summit earlier this year. He called for action on issues that greatly affect women, such as domestic violence, campus sexual assault, abortion access and discrimination and violence against the transgender community.“On Women’s Equality Day, as we recognize the accomplishments that so many women fought so hard to achieve, we rededicate ourselves to tackling the challenges that remain and expanding opportunity for women and girls everywhere,” Obama wrote.Read the full proclamation here.

Americans’ preferences on immigration policy are divided. And there’s no consensus on how gender is affecting Hillary Clinton’s chances. This is HuffPollster for Friday, August 26, 2016.CLINTON’S CAMPAIGN ADVANTAGES ARE APPARENT TO VOTERS - Jon Reid: “Hillary Clinton has run a better presidential campaign than GOP rival Donald Trump, according to a majority of voters in a new Morning Consult poll. The national survey, conducted after the Trump campaign’s third major leadership change this year, shows that 51 percent of voters say Clinton’s campaign is performing better overall….Broken down by political party, a majority of Republicans (54 percent) and Democrats (79 percent) say their party’s respective nominee has run a better campaign. But the difference between the two parties is significant. A small majority of Republican voters say the Trump campaign is doing well, while most Democrats are happy with their nominee’s campaign. Only 8 percent of Democrats say Trump’s campaign is doing better than Clinton’s.” [Morning Consult]Trump could be leaving votes on the table by not campaigning well - John Sides: “Trump is being vastly outspent in advertising and is limited essentially to whatever field organization the Republican National Committee can provide — which will be exceeded by Hillary Clinton’s, much as Romney’s was exceeded by Obama’s. How much will this cost him on Election Day? Probably the best estimate comes from a recently published piece by political scientists Ryan Enos and Anthony Fowler. They show that the effect of the 2012 presidential campaign on voter turnout was quite large, about 7-8 points overall.” [WashPost]MANY AMERICANS SUPPORT BORDER CONTROL AND A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP - Pew Research: “The public is divided over many aspects of U.S. immigration policy. However, when asked about the priorities for policy toward illegal immigration, more Americans say better border security and a path to citizenship should be given equal priority than favor either approach individually. The new national survey, conducted August 9-16 among 2,010 adults, also finds that a large majority (76%) says that undocumented immigrants are as hard-working and honest as U.S. citizens, while 67% say they are no more likely than citizens to commit serious crimes…. Overall, 29% of the public prioritizes ‘creating a way for immigrants already here illegally to become citizens if they meet certain requirements,’ while (24%) say the focus should be on ‘better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws.’ However, when given the option, a 45% plurality does say that both should be given equal priority.” [Pew]Trump supporters generally favor tougher enforcement - Carroll Doherty: “Nearly half (48%) of Trump supporters say the priority for policy to deal with illegal immigration should be stronger law enforcement and better border security. Just 10% say the priority should be creating a way for undocumented immigrants to become citizens if they meet certain requirements. But about four-in-ten (41%) say both of these approaches should be given equal priority. When Trump voters who give equal priority to both are asked to choose just one, a majority overall comes down on the side of stronger law enforcement and better border security: 78% say this should be the priority, compared with just 19% who prioritize a path to citizenship for those in the U.S. illegally. Among Clinton supporters, opinions are nearly reversed: 80% say a path to citizenship should be the priority, while 19% prioritize tougher law enforcement and better border security.” [Pew]AMERICANS ARE SPLIT ON HOW GENDER AFFECTS CLINTON’S CHANCES - Catherine Lucey and Emily Swanson: “According to a new poll from the Associated-Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, most Americans see [Hillary] Clinton’s gender playing a role in the campaign, with 37 percent saying her gender will help her chances of being elected president, 29 percent arguing it will hurt her, and 33 percent thinking it won’t make a difference….Overall, 75 percent of Americans say they think men and women make equally good political leaders, while 17 percent think men make better leaders and 7 percent say women do. Still, about a quarter of Americans, including nearly half of Republicans and more than half of Americans who have a favorable view of Donald Trump, think a female president would not be tough enough to handle a military crisis or a terrorist attack. Men and women are about equally likely to say a woman is tough enough to handle those scenarios facing a president….Despite gains made by women in elected office, just over half of Americans say gender discrimination remains a problem for women in politics, while about 3 in 10 feel the opportunities are about the same. About 2 in 10 think women have more opportunities.” [AP] POLLING MODE AFFECTS CLINTON’S NUMBERS, NOT TRUMP’S - HuffPollster: “In telephone polls conducted by live interviewers, Clinton averages an 11-point lead over Trump in the HuffPost Pollster average. She’s approaching 50 percent, whereas Trump is struggling below 40 percent. These polls are averaging only 5.5 percent undecided and 4.4 percent for other candidates. Polls conducted either online or using automated voice technology over the telephone, without a real person on the other end of the line, tell a different story. In these polls, Clinton averages just under 44 percent support, a 5-point drop from the live telephone polls, while Trump loses less than 1 percentage point, still sitting at about 38 percent. That 5 percent who supported Clinton in live telephone polls, but not in these other polls, seems to have gone to the ‘undecided’ column. In online and automated phone polls, undecideds increase by 5 percent, growing to over 10 percent of voters….Since it’s Clinton’s support that increases when undecideds are pushed in live telephone surveys, the polls indicate that undecided voters tend to lean more in Clinton’s direction.” [HuffPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Speaking with TMZ on Thursday, Isaacs, who’s made it her mission to diversify the awards ceremony after years of #OscarsSoWhite, urged everyone to not let the director’s past cloud the significance of Parker’s film in the current climate of the entertainment industry. “I know just by the conversation that has gone on at Sundance that it’s clearly a movie that filmgoers should go and see,” Isaacs told the gossip site, before admitting she hasn’t even seen the movie. Parker and his college roommate Jean Celestin, the film’s co-writer, were accused in 1999 of rape by a female classmate. Parker was cleared of the charges, claiming that he and the victim had previously engaged in consensual sex, but Celestin was sentenced to six months in prison. Celestin was later granted a mistrial when the victim refused to testify again. She committed suicide in 2012.When pressed about the rape allegations, Isaacs drew a strong distinction between the art and the artist, which some find difficult to separate considering Parker and Celestin’s collaboration and how the film addresses issues of rape and sexual abuse. “That’s one issue, that’s his personal issue,” she added. “And then there’s the issue of the movie. The important thing is for people to see it and enjoy the film, be impressed by the film. And I think that is what is very important. People need to see this movie.”Despite Isaacs’ recommendation, many are far less cavalier about supporting the film, after details of the rape, including new transcripts of disturbing phone calls between Parker and the victim, received increased media attention. Cultural critic and author Roxane Gay penned a particularly powerful response in an editorial for the New York Times earlier this month about the limits of empathy and why she refuses to support the film. “’The Birth of a Nation’ is being billed as an important movie — something we must see, a story that demands to be heard. I have not yet seen the movie, and now I won’t,” she wrote. “Just as I cannot compartmentalize the various markers of my identity, I cannot value a movie, no matter how good or ‘important’ it might be, over the dignity of a woman whose story should be seen as just as important, a woman who is no longer alive to speak for herself, or benefit from any measure of justice. No amount of empathy could make that possible.”"

But the justices were evenly split in the case, leaving the original injunction in place. “I’m filing this lawsuit for myself and the thousands of others like me who have been wronged by this judge’s decision,” said Batalla Vidal in a statement accompanying the lawsuit’s announcement.A spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which was named as a defendant in the case, declined to comment on the case because it’s deemed pending litigation.Batalla Vidal’s legal effort aims to narrow the scope of the original order that left millions of undocumented immigrants like him in the lurch. When U.S. District Judge Andrew ruled in the Texas case, the federal government had no choice but to stop Obama’s immigration proposal dead in its tracks ― even in the 24 states that did not join Texas’ lawsuit over the policies, including New York, which favors deferred action.The National Immigration Law Center, Make the Road New York and the immigrant rights’ clinic at Yale Law School are supporting Batalla Vidal in the litigation.It is unclear to what extent, if at all, this lawsuit might be affected by a separate move the Obama administration made last month asking the Supreme Court to revisit the deadlocked immigration case.Stephen Legomsky, a law professor at Washington University specializing in immigration law, said in an email that the student’s chances are “hard to predict,” but that otherwise “the case law is clear” that court orders like the one Hanen issued shouldn’t be so broad that they go beyond what the plaintiff ― in this case Texas ― is suing about.“A court decision that finds the nationwide injunction improper could support future challenges to the other terms of the same injunction ― especially the part that enjoins all of [Obama’s executive actions],” said Legomsky, also former chief counsel at USCIS. “So there is a great deal at stake.”"

Some 23 percent would not pick either candidate and answered “refused,” “other” or “wouldn’t vote.”Clinton, a former secretary of state, has led real estate developer Trump in the poll since Democrats and Republicans ended their national conventions and formally nominated their presidential candidates in July. Her level of support has varied between 41 and 45 percent during that period, and her lead over Trump in the tracking poll peaked this month at 12 percentage points on Tuesday.During the past week, Clinton has been dogged by accusations by Trump, which she has denied, that donations to her family’s charitable foundation influenced her actions while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Questions have also surfaced again about her use of a private email server and address rather than a government one during her period at the State Department.Meanwhile, Trump and Clinton also sparred over who would be a better advocate for African Americans and other minorities, and Trump hinted he could soften his hard-line stance on immigration. [nL1N1B714Z]In a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that includes candidates from small, alternative parties, Clinton leads the field by a smaller margin. Some 39 percent of likely voters supported Clinton in the four-way poll, compared with 36 percent for Trump, 7 percent for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 3 percent for Green Party nominee Jill Stein.Both polls were conducted online in English in all 50 states. They included 1,154 likely voters and have a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.The results may differ from the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which includes a separate weekly tracking poll that measures support for the major party candidates in every state and Washington D.C.The States of the Nation, released on Wednesday, estimated that if the election were held now Clinton would have a 95 percent chance of winning by a margin of about 108 votes in the Electoral College, the body that decides the election through a count of the candidates’ wins in each state.(Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Frances Kerry)Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The Chicago native, who went to Florida A&M University and currently has a daughter at Howard University, told The Huffington Post that he’s helping HBCU students thanks, in part, to how he felt inspired during his days as an undergrad. “My experience was special because I was meeting young, black inspiring students who were from all over the country,” said Common. “You were surrounded by people who were focused on education and in the same token, our professors and people that were dedicated to seeing us thrive… they were really, really supportive. It all was to our benefit. I wouldn’t have had that experience going to a non-HBCU.”Even though they are educational pillars in black America, many of these schools are suffering from unequal government funding, declining enrollment and poor leadership. Some, like Cheney University and Morris Brown College, are on the verge of closing. Others have shut down operations completely. “This is part of our history, part of our tradition,” he said. “It’s black institutions in America that reinforce who we are and support who we are and nurture who we are. So it’s important that we respect and honor and preserve and enhance those institutions. It’s a way for us to acknowledge our blackness in America ― it’s beautiful.”As a part of this initiative, which lasts until November 30, Allstate will donate $10 for each person who receives a quote from a participating agent and mentions it’s “Quotes for Education” initiative. People can also sign up for quotes online. “I think the young black generation... are the ones who are going to change things in the biggest way,” he said of why he’s giving back. “It’s like giving them the opportunity to be fully prepared and giving them all the resources and giving them the chance to see things and dream and get education and get like opportunities and those things so they can bring all who they are to change [society] for the better for the black community and communities across the world. That’s the most important thing we can do right now. Support them.” "
12,POLITICS,Most GOP Voters Didn't Really Want Trump's Mass Deportation Plan Anyway,Elise Foley and Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-republican-voters-deportation_us_57c05f51e4b04193420ed954,"Even among Republicans, there's significant support for a pathway to citizenship.",2016-08-26,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump said last year that he would create a ""deportation force"" for undocumented immigrants. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c067381800002100bcd57f.jpeg?cache=Cq7sPOFaAu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump wouldn’t really be abandoning Republican voters by shifting away from mass deportation ― he would be joining them. The candidate began backing away this week from his past calls to round up and deport all of the undocumented population, instead indicating openness to some of them remaining in the U.S. It’s unclear whether that was an acknowledgement of reality ― deporting 11 million people was never a realistic goal ― or a step toward embracing legal status for undocumented immigrants, although he again ruled that out on Thursday.But the fact that he was willing to backpedal at all shows his campaign might be aware of another reality: that most voters aren’t as hardline on deportations as he was. Trump’s proposal to deport millions of people faced widespread opposition from Americans, 50 percent of whom said in June that the idea, along with his rhetoric against Mexican immigrants, bothered them “a lot.” Just one-third weren’t at all concerned.Trump’s backers are more prone than the rest of the nation to anti-immigration sentiment, but even they have never been an entirely solid bloc. According to a March poll, about three-quarters of all voters, including 47 percent of Trump’s primary supporters believed that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country legally. While the 42 percent of Trump’s supporters who supported a national law enforcement effort to deport all undocumented immigrants was far higher than the 19 percent of all voters who favored that proposal, it still represented less than half of the businessman’s core supporters.Currently, a 51 percent majority of Trump’s general election backers consider creating a pathway to citizenship at least as much as a priority as amping up border security and law enforcement, although if pressed to pick one approach, they overwhelmingly lean toward protecting the borders.It’s too soon to tell how Trump’s latest statements on immigration will affect his standing in the race. But the public’s views of the issues are, by some measures, as malleable and as contradictory as Trump’s have proved to be.  A summer Gallup survey found three-quarters of Republicans support allowing undocumented immigrants the chance to become U.S. citizens “if they meet certain requirements over a period of time” ― although the same survey also found 50 percent in support of deporting all such immigrants back to their home country.Trump has made contradicting statements on the matter, both publicly and privately. Latino supporters who met with him over the weekend told reporters that he indicated openness to legal status for undocumented immigrants, or even a solution that would involve them visiting the embassy or consulate of their country first rather than traveling back to their country. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) encouraged the GOP nominee to move away from that policy, according to Trump backer and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. It’s not clear that he is actually open to legal status for undocumented immigrants in the style immigration reform supporters want ― he and his campaign have said his positions haven’t changed.Instead, he and campaign aides say he would focus his efforts on building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, deporting criminals and enforcing laws to block undocumented people from employment ― more standard fare on immigration than the initial promise to deport all undocumented immigrants.“There’s no legalization. There’s no amnesty,” Trump told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday. “And if somebody wants to go the legalization route, what they’ll do is they’ll go, leave the country, hopefully come back in. And then we can talk.”But he tested the waters with his supporters earlier this week. He tried out a few hypotheticals with a crowd on Wednesday and found support for all of them, including one that painted a sympathetic picture of an undocumented immigrant. “You have somebody that has been in the country for 20 years. He has done a great job, has a job, everything else, OK?” Trump said. “Do we take him and the family — her or him or whatever — and send them out?” Some people in the crowd shouted, “No!”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Javier escaped the assaults of his family only to endure the reality of the streets. In this week’s Huffington Post Queer Voices RaiseAChild “Let Love Define Family®” series installment, RaiseAChild contributing writer Eric Criswell reports how these teens were robbed of the chance for a stable home life, until they found their way to the Los Angeles Youth Network (LAYN). For many of us, home is a safe place, a refuge from the trials of life. But for many youth, home can be a place of emotional torment, physical pain or outright neglect. Many kids are kicked out of their homes or leave to avoid the continued abuse, only to find they must figure out a way to survive the heartless world of being homeless.“In Los Angeles County there are an estimated 10,000 homeless youth under the age of 18. A third of those will attempt suicide, and over 4,000 identify as gay, lesbian, or transgendered,” stated Raynetta Smith, Development and Communications Manager at Los Angeles Youth Network. “There is an inherent need for organizations like LAYN.”Making a turn off of Hollywood Boulevard onto a residential street immediately took me back to the place where I grew up. Trees line the sidewalk. Houses from the 1920s sit on wide lots of green grass. The sound of lawn mowers hum in the background. It could be almost any street in any town in America, but it is in the heart of Hollywood surrounded by an iconic sign and tourists from every imaginable place. Three of these houses are run by LAYN, an organization that provides extensive programs and services for homeless youth.Having spent my past 15 years working with various organizations in multiple cities assisting youth living on the streets, I found LAYN to be one of the most impressive due to their wide range of support. LAYN does whatever it takes for the benefit of the kids they are helping, even risking the loss of large government grants in order to extend support to individuals that still need it.“These kids are in the system for a reason,” Mark Supper, who is LAYN’s president and CEO, explained. “Most of them come to us having some sort of abuse, whether physical, mental, sexual or neglect and abandonment. It’s our job to get them to trust again and find hope.”If there is one common thread through the staff, counselors, social workers and the kids at LAYN, it is hope. It is spoken as if it is the ultimate outcome, not shelter, not food, but hope as the power to save the world.“I struggle with what is happening out there,” Neena Owusu-Ansah, MSW Case Manager said. “There are so many families that are broken. I think the most difficult thing is to see a young person without their basic needs… it’s just unacceptable. We believe in showing them that they have everything that they need here, and that it can get better.”According to Neena, who has been with the organization for four years, “The numbers keep going up. Last year was the most youth we have had and more of them are trans youth. The education and awareness about being transgender has gone up, but acceptance hasn’t.”There are two particular youth that have had an impact on Neena. She conveys the story of a child in a rural town in New Hampshire who tried to be a cheerleader, but just couldn’t fit in. He was struggling with the knowledge deep inside that he was really a boy. The rejection started in the home with the immediate family and spread into the community with neighbors in the small town voicing their disapproval. Soon the ridicule followed him to school where the other kids were relentless in their teasing and shaming, with no help to be found by teachers or any adults who were busy making up their own lies and stories to spread around town. The only person that defended this boy was his father, who saw the pain in his child’s eyes. These two were no match for the hatred that welled up within this community, so father and son headed off on their own and landed in southern California.With no job and no money, the son and his father became homeless on the streets of Los Angeles. Scared for his life and knowing that survival on the streets was only going to get worse, the youth reached out to LAYN for help. After counseling, permanency planning and support from doctors, the boy asked to change his name. He would now be known as Jordan.When I met Jordan, he was polite and had the personality and temperament of a young man in his mid-twenties, which made it a little shocking when I found out he was only seventeen. In jeans and a red polo, he was a typical teen trying to figure it all out. Having recently received his high school diploma, he was planning for his future to become an airline pilot.Jordan talked about all the things he had learned at LAYN, from doing laundry to learning how to cook. Baking desserts for the whole house became one of his favorite things to do. Beyond basic life skills, he left here much more self-confident than when he arrived and credits finding LAYN with literally saving his life. “The stress of living on the streets was too much, and if I hadn’t found my way here, I know I would’ve turned to drugs, or any way to survive, or even suicide.”Javier is tall and slender, with the hair of a skater that he keeps under his knit cap. He told me the story of when he was young without anyone to take care of him. His parents were often absent, and when they were around, they would spend their time running him down with negative comments.The older he got, the more he began to realize that he was gay.“At first it wasn’t a problem,” Javier explained. “My family said they accepted me and my dad even told me that I had a gay uncle, although I never met him. But the acceptance didn’t last long, and there was a lot of verbal and physical abuse because of who I am. I really didn’t know how to deal with it.”At the age of sixteen, Javier dealt with it by running away. He lived with friends on their couch for a month, until the landlord found out and he was forced to leave. From there he went to another friend’s place for a few weeks, then he ran out of places to go. Isolated from his family, homeless and with no resources, this quiet and sensitive kid began to feel as though he was slipping into a really dark place. With no hope, he attempted to end his life.When he confided in someone about his failed attempt, they gave him the phone number to LAYN. Javier made the call, got the address and walked up to the front door admitting he needed help.“From the moment I walked in,” said Javier, “it felt very positive. It felt like a home. They talked to me with respect and treated me with dignity. I was so scared at first, and was dealing with anger issues. I kept to myself as much as I could. It took a while to realize that they were talking to me because they wanted to, not because they had to. I had become so accustomed to the negative atmosphere of my family, that it was an adjustment being treated like a real person. But, even in the very beginning, I knew it was helping.”At the time of Javier’s arrival, LAYN was limited to 21 days per child due to governmental regulations tied to funding. When those days were up, it was still clear that Javier needed more assistance and resources. So the administration made the bold decision to sever their funding source in order to provide 90 days of care for Javier, and others like him, who needed it.“We made the critical decision to let go of government funding to continue helping Javier and the many youth who have come in after him,” said Supper. “The youth come to us in need of housing and food, but beyond that they need support. They need to find the hope to continue. Like others, Javier was a unique case that needed help beyond the twenty-one days, and we assured him that through the help of our supporters, LAYN would be there for him beyond the governments allotted time.”According to Alicia Riasati, MSW Case Worker at LAYN, although they are not specifically a LGBT organization, they do pride themselves of being an accepting and safe space.“Part of our intake process is that we respect everyone no matter their race, [sexual] orientation, or gender identity,” states Riasati. “For transgender clients, we will place them [where] they feel most comfortable and we are very sensitive to pronouns. We ask each child what they want and everyone will refer to them that way.”It is about the individual person and what they need most. LAYN has a wide array of programs and services to facilitate the ultimate goal of independent successful living for their clients. These programs range from shelter, individual/family counseling, art therapy, drug/alcohol abuse education, life skills tutoring, job development assistance, internships, community outreach, to working with the Los Angeles Unified School District in forming the first high school serving youth experiencing homelessness.As I walked through the houses of LAYN, it easily felt more like a home than a shelter. The feeling that they cultivated at the organization was one of the biggest benefits for Javier. He acknowledges that even with all the support at LAYN there was still a feeling of isolation.“Even though my family was pretty horrible, and they still are, it still hurts,” Javier admits. “They are your family, the ones you grow up with and are supposed to love and protect you. Birthdays and Christmas were painful, and there would be times when I was on the train coming to Hollywood from South Central and it was hard because it was so far away from everyone I knew.”Jordan pointed out, “When I got here, I wasn’t comfortable talking to people at all. But here, they respected me and my gender right away and put me with a male roommate. I began to feel like a regular person for the first time.”The primary order of business was to get Jordan enrolled in classes to continue his education. Neena intervened personally with the teachers to let them know Jordan’s situation and progress and help regulate expectations for everyone. There was therapy work on his gender identity and how he viewed the world, then spent time learning basic life skills. Through determination and hard work, Jordan graduated and was ready to tackle his future.It was decided that Job Corps was the best path forward, however, they had never addressed the issue of trans youth in their program. Jordan was determined to never feel “less than” again and petitioned to be housed in the male dorm and became the first trans youth locally in Job Corps to be placed in the dorm of his choosing and later became president of his floor.“I didn’t feel like it was just a victory for me,” Jordan adds. “There has already been another trans youth arrive at Job Corps. They gave him an option on which dorm to live in, so I know it is already getting better for people who come after me.”“Every child is not looking for the same thing,” Riasati admits. “They have been in situations where people don’t believe in them or have been told repeatedly that they are worthless and never going to make it. What we do is listen to them, give positive reinforcement, and build their self esteem. That is the most important thing they need to make it through the system and continue on with their lives.”“We have the greatest respect for Los Angeles Youth Network,” said Rich Valenza, Founder and CEO of RaiseAChild. “While our work is different, our organizations share a very common goal of doing our best to improve the lives of children and youth.”You can help prevent homelessness for LGBTQ youth by supporting the work of LAYN and RaiseAChild.

Jerry Brown (D) said opponents of the new emissions targets were “vanquished.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c064df180000dd10bcd570.jpeg?cache=rfMUJ3ilMg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California doubled down on its green economy Wednesday as the legislature passed a pair of bills that set ambitious new targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The new goals are being hailed by environmentalists for providing the certainty needed to ramp up clean-tech investment. Governor Jerry Brown announced in a press conference that opponents of the new targets were “vanquished.” Indeed, there had hardly been a squeak from the oil industry or anyone else.Maybe that’s because the cap-and-trade exchange that allows heavy polluters to mitigate their damage by purchasing emission credits, and which is one of the state’s most embattled emission-reduction programs, got kicked down the road. All summer the new emissions goals were embroiled in intense negotiations centered on cap-and-trade — talks that included the legislature, the governor and representatives of Big Oil and other heavy industries. Industry wants certainty about buying into the exchange, which has suffered from low participation in its auctions and is the subject of a lawsuit by the state Chamber of Commerce, and many programs seemed to be on the table.Capital & Main reported in July on the tumultuous and confusing signals coming from the governor’s office, which seemed to indicate that Brown was not only desperate to pass Senate Bill 32, but that he was also trying to strike a grand bargain with the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) and other trade groups to save the cap-and-trade program. This led many to speculate in background conversations that the state might have to sacrifice one of its nation-leading emission-reduction programs. SB 32 is a linchpin of state climate strategy, as it codifies the governor’s former executive order to ratchet up greenhouse gas reduction goals from 1990 levels by 2020 to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.The negotiations were colored by bruising battles in 2015, when moderate Democrats helped block SB 32 and stripped a provision to reduce gasoline use out of another key bill, SB 350, that increased the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard to require 50 percent clean-energy usage by 2030.And then SB 32 sailed through. Have we entered a new era of climate change cooperation? Is somebody keeping their powder dry for bigger battles still to come over state cap-and-trade or other programs? Were foes truly “vanquished?”Part of the answer is that SB 32 was tied to another measure, Assembly Bill 197, which was designed to quell the fears of the moderate Democrats. Each bill required passage of the other.AB 197 was authored by former SB 32-doubting freshman Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia (D-Coachella). Garcia, like many legislators and public interest groups, was concerned that high-profile emission-reduction programs did little to address the effects of climate change in the hardest-hit communities, such as neighborhoods next to refineries or ports or farming regions, where air quality is often the worst. Cap-and-trade, for instance, allows big polluters to pollute as long as they pay for credits or offsets purchased in other parts of the state or country. AB 197 requires that the California Air Resources Board, which directs implementation of emission-reduction programs, should target direct reductions at both stationary and mobile sources in those communities. Such direct reductions are bitterly opposed by oil interests and heavy industry.The bill also restricts CARB board members to six-year terms, which can be repeated, creates a joint legislative oversight committee made up of three Senators and three Assemblymembers to make recommendations about CARB programs to the legislature, and places two legislators in nonvoting, ex-officio positions on the air board to increase legislative understanding and input into the board’s work. Evidently this was enough to smooth the waters.“I can’t say anything’s ever smooth with regard to climate policy!” laughs Bonnie Holmes-Gen, senior director for Air Quality and Climate Change at the American Lung Association. “A lot of legislators want to understand more of what’s happening at the Air Resources Board, and they feel a little more comfortable with Eddie Garcia, that there is provision for more oversight, for engagement, for input from legislative voices. That does provide a lot of reassurance.”When SB 32 was introduced in 2015, many newer legislators were fuzzy on how it actually worked and now understand it better. The bill has also taken a few serious hits: A provision requiring emission reductions to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050 was stripped out of the bill by amendments.“If you look at all of it – the education that’s happened between last year and this, scaling back the bill, and then the companion legislation [AB 197] – I think that all helped,” said Mike Mielke, Senior Vice President for Environment and Energy, at the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a public policy group representing tech industries.With the addition of the two legislative non-voting board members, the state legislature will now have control of four seats on CARB, which expands to 16 seats from being only 12 seats a year ago. A 2015 bill by then-Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins (D-San Diego) added two legislature-appointed seats to represent environmental justice concerns, which were filled in February by former state Senator Dean Florez from the Central Valley and Diane Takvorian of Environmental Health Coalition, which is based in the San Diego/Tijuana area.Will this big board or any of the other changes hamper the ability of CARB to carry out its mandate?“I don’t think it hurts it,” says Bill Magavern, policy director at Coalition for Clean Air. “It’s a substantial expansion, so there may be some growing pains there. But CARB and the legislature have to continue to try to understand each other better. Because I hear a lot of criticisms from legislators that are just uninformed…. CARB needs to do a better job of explaining its programs and its processes to the legislature.”All of this, however, still leaves questions as to what will happen to cap-and-trade and what kind of talks Gov. Brown really had with the oil industry. In July his office acknowledged being in direct talks with the WSPA to find a way forward past 2020, when both the emission-reduction targets of AB 32 and the state’s cap-and-trade program were set to expire. He was openly seeking a way to create a bill with two-thirds supermajority support that would head off the need to reauthorize the cap-and-trade program, in particular. In fact, the governor submitted draft language for SB 32 to address this issue, although it was not incorporated into the bill.As one close observer speaking on background characterized the talks, the governor and Big Oil went in trying to reach an agreement on cap-and-trade – which proved impossible to get – and they came out instead with “just cap.” The governor’s office helped shape AB 197 and, with Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount) throwing his back into this climate package, setting a new cap became doable. So they skipped cap-and-trade for now.The WSPA, which did not respond to interview requests, issued a statement Tuesday by President Catherine Reheis-Boyd, after SB 32’s passage, claiming the legislature had really ducked the issue:“AB 197 also does not address fundamental cap-and-trade issues that SB 32 conveniently dodges. In fact, it goes in the opposite direction by promoting a command-and-control system that is contrary to a market-based mechanism like cap-and-trade and would further undermine the market. Despite today’s symbolic victory for some, we will continue to do the real work required to make the appropriate fixes to cap-and-trade that can send the market real certainty.”Cap-and-trade has been under attack because of recent anemic auctions of its pollution credits – the latest poor auction results, held last week, were announced on Tuesday, as SB 32 passed. Uncertainty about the program has caused electric utilities and other industries who participate in those auctions to hold back on purchases. Several public interest representatives speaking on condition of anonymity expressed fear that heavy industry might embrace cap-and-trade in exchange for softening or even eliminating programs like the state’s Low-Carbon Fuel Standards, which mandate use of such alternative fuels as ethanol, and of lower-carbon fuels like natural gas rather than petroleum. But that didn’t happen.Cap-and-trade has also been a lightning rod for other reasons: Funds it has generated, which are being used to develop high-speed rail between Los Angeles and San Francisco among other projects, have been the subject of a four-year-old lawsuit brought by the California Chamber of Commerce, which calls the purchases a tax.“This sort of uncertainty is never good for business,” said Alex Jackson, legal director of the California Climate Project at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “That’s what’s really at stake [with the passage of SB 32]: California’s climate policies writ large do not rest on one piece of legislation or one target, but this sort of legislation lifts all boats, and it sends a clear economy-wide signal that California remains committed to its path to clean energy.”Mike Mielke of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group notes there are two reasons why SB 32 is essential. “A, because it’s the right thing to do, and B, because [clean tech] is a larger and larger part of the state’s economy and it’s a larger and larger part of the Silicon Valley economy.”California’s green economy has been credited with creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the state, including high-qualityskilled positions that have brought labor union support to climate targets like those set out in SB 32.Mielke chastised the media for often portraying “business” as standing opposed to environmentalism. “Some businesses, like heavy manufacturing and the oil industry, don’t care for this, but a lot of other businesses, like the ones that make up the majority of our membership, do. Silicon Valley is a valley of scientists and engineers. They see this as a problem to be solved, and a challenge to be addressed, and a way, honestly, to make money and create jobs.”Governor Brown is signaling very clearly that he intends to fight for every emission-reduction tool available, although California will have to wait for the next round of auctions to see whether the strong signal of new carbon-reduction targets drives participants into the carbon markets.“Now is really not the time for us to back off, when the world is watching, and when we have seen that these programs are working, both for the impact they’re having on our air quality and therefore our health, as well as the positive impact on our economy,” said Sandra Fluke, California State Director of Voices for Progress. “We do have to remember that, aside from revenues produced by the cap-and-trade auctions, which are important … the point of cap and trade is to lower greenhouse gas emissions. And that is working very successfully.”"

During a recent visit to Keech Hospice Care in Luton, England, the Duke of Cambridge gave some advice to 14-year-old Ben Hines, who lost his mother, Alexandra, to cancer last year. William spoke to the teen about grief, drawing from his own experience with the death of his mother, Princess Diana. “Time makes it easier. I know how you feel, I still miss my mother every day and it’s 20 years after she died,” William told Ben and his family, according to the Press Association. “The important thing is to talk about it as a family, it’s OK to feel sad, it’s OK for you to miss her.”The prince’s wife, Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton, was also present for the visit to Keech Hospice Care. The pair toured the facility to learn more about it, particularly the bereavement support and art therapy services, the organization’s website noted. They also helped the facility celebrate its 25th anniversary. Hines, who has autism, explained to William during the visit that he’s missed his mother since she died last June and has had difficulty dealing with loss, The London Times reported. In addition to urging the teen and his family to communicate, William also acknowledged that sometimes it’s difficult to air out emotions. “As four boys, you have to talk a lot better ― we’re not good sharers. It’s a classic example of lots of talking needed,” he said, later asking the group to be open with their feelings ― something Ben’s brother Thomas said he’d promise to do. The family was moved by the royal couple’s kindness during the interaction. “Himself and Kate were incredibly caring and interested in what we had to say,” Gary Hines, Ben’s father, told BBC Radio 5 Live. He added, “They put us at ease straight away and were genuinely interested and that made the difference.” "

17,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Is Winning The Ad War -- And Americans Have Noticed,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-trump-campaign-ads_us_57c0a61ce4b02673445018c3,"Americans say they're seeing more ads from Clinton, but more news about Donald Trump.",2016-08-26,"Americans say that even though they see more ads from Clinton, they're talking more about Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c0a9f21700000011c75c6f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton’s massive lead over Donald Trump on ad spending hasn’t gone unnoticed by the American public.Forty-seven percent of Americans polled in a new HuffPost/YouGov survey say that they’ve seen more ads from Clinton during the last month than they have from Trump. Just 7 percent say they’ve seen more Trump ads. Another 24 percent say they’ve seen an equal number for each candidate, while 15 percent haven’t seen any commercials and 7 percent are unsure. People’s self-reported recollections aren’t exactly perfect, and some will mistakenly report having seen ads that they couldn’t possibly have watched. In one study, 17 percent of people told pollsters that they remembered seeing a commercial that had never actually been played for them.But lending credence to the results is the lack of partisan split you’d expect to see if people on either side were trying to prop up their own party with their responses. Fifty percent of Republicans, and a nearly identical 53 percent of Democrats, say they’ve seen more ads from Clinton.And, more importantly, the public’s impression that Clinton is outgunning Trump on the airwaves matches up with the numbers. Clinton’s campaign has outspent Trump’s campaign by a 17-to-1 margin, NBC News reported earlier this week, and even with outside groups supporting both candidates factored in, the Democrats retain a 6-to-1 advantage. “We haven’t seen a modern presidential campaign that is so lopsided in terms of advertising,” wrote Erika Franklin Fowler, the co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. Recent history offers little precedent for exactly how much that imbalance is likely to affect Trump, whose campaign voters increasingly perceive as being poorly run.“The evidence suggests that campaign ads have small effects that decay rapidly — very rapidly — but just enough of the impact accumulates to make running more advertising than your opponent seem a necessity,” political scientist Lynn Vavreck wrote in June. “It sets off an arms race of ads as candidates try to neutralize or displace their opponents. But will the 2016 general election be different? Mr. Trump has used unconventional campaign tactics and has relied on free media to get his messages out. All of this may render advertising less relevant.”Although Trump is losing on ad spending, he’s still getting plenty of airtime and ink. By a 27-point margin, 40 percent to 13 percent, Americans say they’ve seen more news stories about Trump than Clinton in the past month, with 38 percent reporting hearing equally about both. “I have a little TV in my office. If I put it on right now, I have a 75 percent chance of seeing him,” Jordan Cohen, the chief marketing officer for the digital marketing firm Fluent, told The Wall Street Journal.Perhaps as a result, Trump also comes up more in Americans’ conversations: Twenty-nine percent say they spend more time talking about him, while 13 percent spend more time talking about Clinton. A 53 percent majority spend equal time talking about both candidates, or try to eschew mentioning either candidate.The poll finds less clear of a disparity in other forms of messaging. While Trump has an 8-point edge over Clinton on the number of posts Americans have seen from him on Twitter and Facebook during the last month, 52 percent of respondents say they’ve seen equal postings from both candidates or none at all. Roughly equal percentages of Americans also reported being contacted by each campaign. Ten percent said they’d heard from Clinton’s campaign, 11 percent said they’d heard from Trump’s, 4 percent said they’d heard from both, and 69 percent said they hadn’t heard from either.

And in November, women will use their hard-fought right to likely keep one of the most sexist presidential candidates in modern history out of the Oval Office. Women have skewed Democratic for decades, but this year the numbers could be even more dramatic. Women voters are overwhelmingly supportive of Hillary Clinton; while their male counterparts still lean towards her opponent.Donald Trump is faring terribly in the polls with women: Sixty percent of female likely voters said they’d go for Clinton in a head-to-head matchup against the reality TV star, according to a Quinnipiac poll out Thursday. Meanwhile, 48 percent of men said they’d vote for Trump, versus 42 percent for Clinton. An Economist/YouGov poll has Clinton polling 10 points ahead of Trump among women when you throw third-party candidates into the mix. Men, meanwhile, were 4 points more likely to choose Trump than Clinton. And an NBC/SurveyMonkey poll found Clinton was up 21 points with female voters, but male voters preferred Trump by 6 percent.There’s been a lot of talk of how Trump’s popularity with white men is shaping the election, but less focus on women: not “soccer moms” or “security moms” or some other reductive description for female voters, who for some reason are treated as a special interest group in U.S. politics. They are not. Women makeup 52 percent of the voting-age population in the U.S. And women vote at higher rates than men. In 2014, 43 percent of women voted, compared with 41 percent of men, according to Census data. And many women may have extra incentive to turn out this year and vote for the country’s first woman president and against Trump, whose history of offensive remarks about women has dogged him throughout his campaign.Even though women are still woefully underrepresented in the Senate, the House and governor’s offices around the country, the power of the 19th Amendment ensures that we do have a voice in U.S. politics.Fittingly, one of Trump’s most vocal business supporters ― billionaire Peter Thiel ― has said before that women earning the vote was bad for Democracy. While that’s of course not true, we can say with certainty that the 19th Amendment hasn’t been good for Trump himself. This is a man who seems determined to treat women as less than full human beings. He has called women pigs; said pumping breast milk and women going to the bathroom are “disgusting”; expressed the idea that husbands shouldn’t let their wives work outside the home; and made it clear that the primary way he considers women is based on looks.He holds rallies where his opponent is called a “bitch” and worse ― and lately has portrayed Clinton as a hysterical, unstable woman. His campaign CEO has a dodgy history with a domestic violence charge. While Trump’s daughter Ivanka has attempted to portray her father as an advocate for women’s rights, and there is evidence that he promoted and encouraged the women who worked for him at his real-estate company, his policy platform offers little on women’s issues: nothing on paid leave, some vague talk about equal pay if it’s “deserved,” and a child care tax credit that would clearly benefit those in the upper-income brackets.Come November, women will have the final say on whether that disconnect is going to work.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

And an NBC/SurveyMonkey poll found Clinton was up 21 points with female voters, but male voters preferred Trump by 6 percent.There’s been a lot of talk of how Trump’s popularity with white men is shaping the election, but less focus on women: not “soccer moms” or “security moms” or some other reductive description for female voters, who for some reason are treated as a special interest group in U.S. politics. They are not. Women makeup 52 percent of the voting-age population in the U.S. And women vote at higher rates than men. In 2014, 43 percent of women voted, compared with 41 percent of men, according to Census data. And many women may have extra incentive to turn out this year and vote for the country’s first woman president and against Trump, whose history of offensive remarks about women has dogged him throughout his campaign.Even though women are still woefully underrepresented in the Senate, the House and governor’s offices around the country, the power of the 19th Amendment ensures that we do have a voice in U.S. politics.Fittingly, one of Trump’s most vocal business supporters ― billionaire Peter Thiel ― has said before that women earning the vote was bad for Democracy. While that’s of course not true, we can say with certainty that the 19th Amendment hasn’t been good for Trump himself. This is a man who seems determined to treat women as less than full human beings. He has called women pigs; said pumping breast milk and women going to the bathroom are “disgusting”; expressed the idea that husbands shouldn’t let their wives work outside the home; and made it clear that the primary way he considers women is based on looks.He holds rallies where his opponent is called a “bitch” and worse ― and lately has portrayed Clinton as a hysterical, unstable woman. His campaign CEO has a dodgy history with a domestic violence charge. While Trump’s daughter Ivanka has attempted to portray her father as an advocate for women’s rights, and there is evidence that he promoted and encouraged the women who worked for him at his real-estate company, his policy platform offers little on women’s issues: nothing on paid leave, some vague talk about equal pay if it’s “deserved,” and a child care tax credit that would clearly benefit those in the upper-income brackets.Come November, women will have the final say on whether that disconnect is going to work.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

22,POLITICS,"Yes, Citizens United And Other Court Rulings Led To A Rise In Dark Money",Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dark-money-supreme-court_us_57c09b32e4b0267344500abb,"No, it wasn't like this before the court started deregulating campaign finance.",2016-08-26,"Political strategist Karl Rove co-founded the dark money group Crossroads GPS, the most prolific advertiser among independent groups in the 21st century.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c09b9e1600003503bfebb4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In case there was still any argument left on the matter, a new report from the Wesleyan Media Project and the Center for Responsive Politics shows how much spending by groups that don’t disclose their donors soared in response to Supreme Court decisions that deregulated campaign finance.Although there has been a lot of ink spilled (or keyboards mashed) showing how undisclosed or “dark” money surged following the court’s recent campaign finance decisions, this new report goes one step further by examining the actual number of advertisements these groups ran from 2000 through 2016. This unprecedented look at dark money shows definitively that there can be no other reason for the dark money surge than deregulatory court rulings.In the 2000 election, dark money nonprofits aired more than 34,000 advertisements, according to the report. This number dropped by half to slightly above 15,000 for both the 2004 and 2006 elections before skyrocketing to over 158,000 in 2008. By the next presidential election in 2012, dark money groups ran over 383,000 ads. You can see these surges in the chart below.What the report shows that is new is that the surge in dark money spending was not an illusion created by new disclosure rules enacted in 2002. That year, Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, more popularly known as McCain-Feingold after its bipartisan Senate co-sponsors, John McCain and Russ Feingold. It included requirements that independent groups, like nonprofits or 527s or even political party committees, disclose their election spending within certain windows before an election. This disclosure requirement even included spending that simply named candidates immediately before an election.Previous examinations of the surge in dark money looked at this disclosed spending. The new report’s look at actual advertisement airings adds a new wrinkle to this by providing a measure that goes back before the McCain-Feingold disclosure requirements were put in place.Or as Robert Maguire, political nonprofit investigator for the Center for Responsive Politics, says, “This shows more conclusively than any study done in the past that there really is a change in quantity that goes along with court decisions and the lack of oversight of these groups that has allowed nonprofit groups to be a much more tantalizing vehicle for people who want to hide their political spending.”The two surges, first in 2008 and second after 2010, came in response to two Supreme Court decisions and one rule-making by the Federal Election Commission that significantly loosened campaign finance rules. In the 2007 Wisconsin Right to Life case, the court ruled that certain nonprofit corporations could spend corporate money on electioneering so long as it stopped short of calling for the election or defeat of a candidate. This is what we’d call “issue ads.” The FEC followed up this ruling by gutting a new regulation imposed by the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law requiring all independent groups spending money on elections to disclose their donors.Then in 2010, the court ruled in the Citizens United v. FEC case that corporations and unions could legally spend unlimited sums of money on elections so long as it remained independent from candidate campaigns and political parties. Although the court’s ruling included a strong endorsement for donor disclosure, the ruling essentially lifted a major obstacle to dark money in elections by allowing nonprofits to use corporate donations to fund express electoral expenses.Why does this even matter? Well, those connected to dark money groups have repeatedly defended the practice by stating that they were simply trying to level the playing field. In particular, Karl Rove, who helped launch the dark money nonprofit Crossroads GPS, which came under fire from Democrats, argued in the Wall Street Journal that “liberal groups have operated for decades in the same way GPS does without Democrats complaining.”Although it is certainly true that both Democratic and Republican nonprofits did operate similarly by spending money on elections without disclosing their donors before Crossroads GPS formed, they did so at a wildly lower volume than Crossroads GPS and other groups did after the Supreme Court loosened the rules. That increased volume has been largely driven by groups that popped up after court rulings ― like Crossroads GPS.In fact, Crossroads GPS, founded in 2010, has aired more ads than any other independent group from 2000-2016. The conservative nonprofit aired more than 207,000 ads, according to the report. That is 50,000 more ads than the second most prolific ad buyer, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Once defended by Rove as a grassroots conservative nonprofit, Crossroads GPS has practically disappeared as a political force since it nearly lost its nonprofit status ― the very thing protecting it from disclosing its donors. The group’s tiny staff, however, has moved on to another nonprofit called One Nation. The new group has only run ads in the 2016 election, but it is already in the top 30 among all independent spenders.“The idea that Crossroads or any of these groups are active in the same way that a handful of groups were active in the past is absurd,” Maguire says.And now there’s a study to prove it."

And that has nothing to do with their religion.While France’s burkini ban conflates top-to-toe swimwear with religious fundamentalism, in India, as in other parts of the non-western world, coverage is simply essential for comfort. In fact, it’s not rare to see women enjoying water park rides fully-dressed, floating among the crowd in a public swimming pool wearing saris or salwar kameezes.For instance, here’s some photos of Indian women at water parks across the country.And here are some of the swimwear options on sale at India’s top e-commerce websites:For Indian women, being covered gives them the freedom to go out and enjoy the water, without worrying about the way that their bodies look.And that’s exactly what the creator of the burkini, Aheda Zanetti, was going for with her invention. Indeed, she claims that more than 40% of burkinis are sold to non-Muslim women, suggesting that there’s a big market for modest swimwear that cuts across religious lines.“The Jewish community embraces it. I’ve seen Mormons wearing it. A Buddhist nun purchased it for all of her friends. I’ve seen women who have issues with skin cancer or body image, moms, women who are not comfortable exposing their skin — they’re all wearing it,” Zanetti told Politico.Add Indian women to that list.This article originally appeared on Quartz India."

Sarkozy declared his plans to seek the nomination of the Republican Party in Tout pour la France (Everything for France), his book that came out Wednesday. The platform he outlines in the book indicates a shift toward right-wing identity politics, including a tougher stance on Islam and stricter immigration policy. His remarks come at a time when France is submerged in a debate over the burkini, a full-body swimsuit that mayors in more than a dozen seaside towns have decided to ban this month. France’s top administrative court, the Conseil d’Etat, overturned the burkini ban in Villeneuve-Loubet on Friday, stating that it “had seriously infringed, in a manner that was clearly illegal, fundamental liberties such as the freedom to come and go, religious freedom and individual freedom,” but the decision is unlikely to put an end to the debate. Sarkozy’s platform, and his most recent suggestions regarding Islamic dress, cater to voters on the right who are calling for more security and policing of political Islam in the aftermath of almost two years of terrorist attacks. In an interview with Le Figaro Magazine this week, Sarkozy described wearing burkinis as “a militant, provocative, and political act.”“To do nothing would make people think that France is weak, it would facilitate a further decline of the Republic,” he said. “If we do not put an end to this, the risk is that in 10 years, Muslim girls who don’t wear a headscarf or a burkini will be stigmatized and put under daily peer pressure,” he said, lumping the Islamic headscarf together with the disputed swimsuit.This week, French police confronted women dressed in outfits resembling the burkini on the beach, leading to public outcry. Four police officers asked a woman reclining on a beach in Nice to remove some of her clothing, and gave her a ticket for not wearing “an outfit respecting good morals and secularism.” During an with interview on TF1, the former president said that “the best way to ease tensions is to proscribe any outward signs of religion” in the public space. In Everything for France, he outlines a law that would ban religious symbols not only in state schools, which haven’t allowed headscarfs since 2004, but also in universities and administrative buildings. Sarkozy has continued to harden his rhetoric against Islam and conspicuous religiosity in France over the past decade. It’s been quite the turnaround for someone who once championed “positive secularism.” During Pope Benedict XVI’s first visit to France in 2008, the then-president said it was “legitimate for democracy and respectful of secularism to have a dialogue with religions.”A year later, Sarkozy maintained that while “the Muslim religion must be respected as much as other religions,” full veils were “not welcome” in France. “In our country, we can’t accept women prisoners behind a screen, cut off from all social life, deprived of all identity. That’s not our idea of freedom,” he said in 2009.In the same year, however, he indicated that he had no major problem with the headscarf. “In France, any girl who wants to wear the headscarf can do so. It’s their freedom,” he said.Throughout his presidency, he pushed for broader restrictions on Islamic dress. In 2011, Sarkozy banned the niqab and the burqa in all public spaces, as part of a law prohibiting people from covering their face in public. Back then, he was accused of instating the ban to win votes from the extreme right. A version of this piece originally appeared on HuffPost France.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bf0604170000aa0fc75693.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AMATRICE, Italy ― A garage has been turned into a morgue. Outside the entrance to this underground space, a line of people has formed. Many of them are wrapped in quilts, calmly awaiting painful answers regarding their missing loved ones. “I’m looking for my brother. I don’t know if they’ve brought him here, or if maybe he’s still alive, though who knows where he is,” says Claudia. The 44 year-old escaped the quake unharmed but is still dirtied with rubble and dust. Another person speaks up: “I want to talk to the police. Where are the other dead bodies? I’m looking for my father.”People here are facing an enormous sense of desperation after a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck early Wednesday, causing untold damage. It’s a swarm of ceaseless unhappiness. The tremors continue throughout the night, one rumble after the next. Inside the garage-turned-morgue, the smell has grown overpowering, and at 2 a.m. the decision is made to evacuate the premises. One by one the coffins are loaded into ambulances and taken to another collection center. Only then does a lone man decide to leave the pallet where he’s curled up and taken refuge to cry alone. “They just took my wife away,” he laments. The bodies that are carried out of the garage cross paths with other bodies that have just been pulled from the rubble of a three-story building by firefighters. “There are seven more here,” shouts a young man with the Red Cross. The mountain of rubble, where more than 30 men are searching tirelessly, is lit with powerful spotlights. Someone signals for the group’s attention. Others bring a stretcher and white bags. This is the very moment a body is pulled from the bricks: “It’s a boy,” says Luca, a volunteer who is probably the same age as the victim. The parents stand nearby in tears, heartbroken but composed, then line up behind the stretcher.This same scene is repeated over and over again, including outside Hotel Roma. Once world-famous for its spaghetti all’amatriciana, the hotel has turned into a cemetery for an unknown number of dead, buried in rubble in the heart of the “red zone,” the most dangerous and hardest-hit section of this town in central Italy’s Rieti province.Some sleep in cars parked along country roads, far from any buildings. One woman can’t sleep, and at half past three in the morning ― the same time the first major quake hit ― she can be seen wandering around, murmuring to herself: “The children... the children... I can’t think about it.” Italian Civil Protection agency vehicles are busy bringing what seems like an entire town’s population into a tent city erected to protect the newly homeless from their first cold night outside, marking the beginning of a prolonged ordeal for many of the town’s citizens. In the neighboring town of Accumoli, psychologists are getting to know children still in shock. There are diapers for the youngest ones, and milk for breakfast. But nobody can get any sleep.

31,POLITICS,Progressive Activists Take A Seat For The People At Federal Reserve Retreat,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-reserve-fed-up-jackson-hole_us_57bf7095e4b02673444f65b5,"This time, top officials gathered to listen to the reformers' ideas.",2016-08-26,"Fed Up activists, seen here in February 2016, have converged on the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole retreat this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bf71951800002100bcd38b.jpeg?cache=s7o6hn9E1M&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two years ago this week, the nonprofit Center for Popular Democracy and allied groups launched the Fed Up campaign, aimed at making the Federal Reserve more accountable to workers and communities of color. They converged then on the Jackson Lake Lodge in Wyoming, where Fed officials decamp every year to discuss policy and hobnob with the economic elite.How much political headway has the campaign made since then? This year, Fed Up activists were essentially put on the schedule for senior Federal Reserve officials, with a major meeting at the Jackson Hole summit.The group met Thursday, the first day of the summit, with eight of the 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks and two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.Fed Up activists have met individually with the governors and regional bank presidents before; they spoke with some Fed officials less formally at the past two Jackson Hole gatherings. This is the first time, however, that their delegation of some 120 rank-and-file activists had met with so many of the central bank’s decision-makers in one place.“It is kind of like a mini-FOMC,” said Fed Up campaign manager Jordan Haedtler prior to the event, likening it to a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s policymaking body.The progressive campaign is calling for the central bank to wait for the economic recovery to reach more broadly across America before raising its benchmark interest rate again, a move that slows the pace of economic growth to head off price inflation.It has also criticized the Fed for the lack of racial, gender and professional background diversity among its senior officials, arguing that only a central bank that looks like America can craft policy in the best interests of all citizens.The Fed officials at the meeting were Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which hosts the annual symposium; New York Fed president William Dudley; Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan; Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari; Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester; Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren; San Francisco Fed president John Williams; Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker, and Fed governors Stanley Fischer and Lael Brainard.“They were really impressed with how well prepared we were,” said Haedtler after the meeting. “They were heartened by the discussion.”“We’ll see how things go in September,” he added, referring to the next opportunity for an interest rate hike.Bill Medley, a spokesman for the Kansas City Fed, also gave positive feedback about the meeting.“It was a productive dialogue, as it always is, and we look forward to continuing the conversation,” Medley said.Fed Up has had a banner year so far. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton embraced the broad contours of its platform in May after weeks of private discussion with group representatives. “Secretary Clinton believes that the Fed needs to be more representative of America as a whole as well as that commonsense reforms — like getting bankers off the boards of regional Federal Reserve banks — are long overdue,” a Clinton spokesman said at the time.But Clinton stopped short of signing on to a bolder reform proposal that Fed Up rolled out in April, which would turn the central bank system into an entirely public institution. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors is already a federal agency, whose top officials are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. But the 12 regional banks it supervises are owned by the private financial institutions they serve. (Fed Up released a more detailed version of its idea on Monday.)The private nature of these banks is a major reason why they are run overwhelmingly by white men with backgrounds in finance, Fed Up argues. There has never been a black or Latino president of one of the regional banks, the group notes in its reform proposal, and one-third of the current bank heads are alumni of Wall Street power player Goldman Sachs.Fed Up’s moment at this year’s Jackson Hole symposium was not without its hiccups.Earlier this month, Fed Up were informed that the Jackson Lake Lodge had canceled over a dozen of its room reservations. The hotel said a “computer glitch” had led to the overbooking of 18 rooms. But the fact that 13 of those rooms were booked by Fed Up raised concerns that they were being targeted.Although the activists found lodging at a nearby resort, Fed Up filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice, and members of Congress sympathetic to their cause sent Fed Chair Janet Yellen a letter asking for an explanation.In an apparent gesture of detente, George, the Kansas City Fed president, offered Fed Up the big meeting, and the campaign withdrew its objections to the lodging snafu.Fed Up agreed also to limit its presence in the lodge’s halls during a scheduled cocktail hour. In the past, activists have clustered inside the hotel to confront Fed officials in person. The group held a press conference-cum-rally outside the lodge before Thursday’s meeting. It also plans to run teach-in seminars and to canvass the city’s low-income neighborhoods to spread the word about Fed reform.But Haedtler, Fed Up’s campaign manager, wanted to focus on Thursday’s meeting. It is evidence, he said, that his fledgling movement’s priorities have made it into the mainstream.“We have clearly reshaped the discourse,” Haedtler said."

Their killer, disgruntled former WDBJ employee Vester Lee Flanagan, was filming when he gunned the pair down, and posted videos of the horrifying incident to social media before shooting himself dead during a police pursuit.Andy Parker then dedicated himself to anti-gun activism and lashed out at the NRA, saying at the time, “They messed with the wrong family.” He feared for his life as he took podium after podium, railing against lawmakers who voted against stricter gun laws.But over the past year, not enough has changed, so Andy Parker isn’t going to change.On Friday, he penned an op-ed in the New York Daily News, twisting his sword in the gut of “treasonous Republican leadership” that hasn’t moved toward reform despite a shocking amount of gun violence in America since Alison’s death.He writes:In the lead-up to this day, I’ve been asked what’s changed in the last year. The NRA still controls too many politicians. There is no new meaningful common-sense gun legislation passed at a federal level, and terrorists on watch lists can still buy weapons even if they can’t board a flight.READ MORE: Father of slain reporter remembers his daughter’s strengthHe pointed a finger directly at House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), a “coward” politician known for undermining a 9/11 first responder health care bill and refusing to hold hearings on gun control in his district after Parker and Ward’s slaying.Andy Parker continued:My only question for him was, “Bob, how do you sleep at night?”Today, Parker says he won’t falter in his fight for gun control. He won’t let us forget about Alison, and he won’t stop fighting “to be free of gun violence.”“Momentum is on our side and it’s only a matter of time until we prevail,” he said. “The needle has moved, and I’m not going to lose this fight. I’m Alison’s dad.”"

The country music group, which consists of singers Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard, joined forces with the boy band for the song “God, Your Mama, and Me.” The single is featured on FGL’s third studio album, “Dig Your Roots,” debuting Friday.The Huffington Post spoke to Kelley and Hubbard by phone as the duo promoted their first foray into the whiskey business, Old Camp Whiskey. The guys told us they’ve been fans of BSB for years ― the group provided Kelley’s first concert experience in 6th grade and their music was the first Hubbard owned on CD. Over the years, FGL told press about their love for the ‘90s band, and their words eventually reached the right people.“We got some good energies and good vibrations out and, next thing you know, Nick Carter was hanging out on our bus at the CMA Fest this summer,” Kelley said. “We played him the song and things just happened so quick. But you gotta jump on things like that when they happen and it was just a bucket list collaboration for us.” Earlier this year, BSB’s Nick Carter and Brian Littrell caused a stir when the two posted photos on Instagram announcing their Florida Georgia Line collaboration. Though the bands didn’t record in the studio together, Kelley says the final product is everything they thought it would be. “I mean, their voices sound amazing with ours,” Kelly said. “It just sounds amazing, it sounds exactly like we thought it would. Just having them on the record was a dream. Something that we were saying when the song was actually done ― me and Tyler had it done ― and we said it sounds kind of like a modern day Backstreet Boys song.” He’s not wrong.

The legendary entertainer’s social justice organization Sankofa.org will host the “Many Rivers To Cross Festival” in Atlanta, Georgia, on Oct. 1. The two-day music and arts event will serve as a platform for artists, community organizers and activists to collaborate on the advancement of voting rights, mass incarceration and police relations ― to name a few.Jesse Williams, John Legend, Common, Chris Rock and Carlos Santana are among the list of names set to participate. Belafonte said during a press call Thursday that the event, which has been billed as the “largest music and arts festival dedicated to racial and social justice,” will give artists the platform to connect their material with topics surrounding relevant issues, such as America’s judicial system. “Most of the artists will be dealing with material that’s relevant to the issue of justice and incarceration,” Belafonte said. “One of the things that we asked was that they create material to [discuss] the miscarriage of justice as the case may be.”The civil rights pioneer added that Sankofa has partnered with BET to film the the event which will be announced at a later date.In terms of laying the ground work for “Many Rivers To Cross,” Belafonte says he initially met with Prince, who he called “a force,” during its planning phase.“I was supposed to meet Prince on the week he died,” he said of the late musical icon. “We were going to have our fourth meeting in New York when we got word that he had unfortunately passed away.”Belafonte says the music icon’s tribute song, “Baltimore” ― which was recorded following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray ― will serve as a centerpiece for the event.In addition to the list of empowering symposiums and performances, fans will have the opportunity to meet community organizations and thought-leaders at the “Social Justice Village.” There will also be an activation area which will provide attendees with additional info on advancing today’s human rights issues.For Public Enemy member Chuck D, who is performing at the festival, the importance and urgency of artists and cultural leaders to come together and accept their responsibility for change is long overdue. “Historically, artists have come from the communities that face these same issues,” he said during the call. “But for the past 30 years artists have listened to and followed the program of their lawyers, agents, managers who have kind of dangled money in their career to get them away from the accountability and responsibility.“So this is necessary. Artists linking up with real situations, real people doing real things to redefine our society is necessary.” For more info on the “Many Rivers To Cross” festival click here."

You just need somebody to let a little out.”Parker has since learned to deal with feelings of anxiety by discussing them with friends and family in the moment, she said.And she’s totally right to do so: Talking about mental health not only helps treat mental health issues, but also helps to reduce stigma. Research shows negative stereotypes often prevent people from seeking support ― and the more people like Parker open up, the more those stereotypes are smashed. Parker is just one of many celebrities who have been generating awareness around mental health in the media recently. Last year, she discussed the importance of creating more compassion around mental health ― especially when it comes to veterans and PTSD ― in Glamour magazine.Ultimately, Parker told the Coveteur, taking care of your mental wellbeing in the moment is all about understanding methods that put you at ease. For her, it’s indulging in a good book. For others, that may be going for a walk or trying a little meditation.But most importantly? It’s important to tackle any psychological issues head-on, she says.“My mental wellness is reliant on me figuring out how to cope,” she told the publication. “I’m also on the other hand not afraid of feeling anxious, I just want to know that I can handle my nerves or my anxiousness, or disappointment or sadness about myself or friends and family members.”Sounds pretty healthy to us.Read more from Parker’s interview over at The Coveteur."

I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you cocksucker,” LePage said. “I want to talk to you. I want you to prove that I’m a racist. I’ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. You, I need you to, just freakin’, I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you.”Listen to the full voicemail below:In January, LePage said men with names like “D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty” were dealing drugs in Maine and impregnating white women. Earlier this week, he said the binder he kept proved he isn’t racist because it supported his statements about the racial makeup of the traffickers.LePage released a statement Friday, saying he was angry and apologizing for his language.“When someone calls me a racist, I take it very seriously. I didn’t know Drew Gattine from a hole in the wall until yesterday. It made me enormously angry when a TV reporter asked me for my reaction about Gattine calling me a racist. It is the absolute worst, most vile thing you can call a person,” he said. “So I called Gattine and used the worst word I could think of. I apologize for that to the people of Maine, but I make no apology for trying to end the drug epidemic that is ravaging our state.”The governor also said that he never intended to harm Gattine.“When I said I was going after Gattine, I meant I would do everything I could to see that he and his agenda is defeated politically. I am a history buff, and I referenced how political opponents used to call each other out in the 1820s — including Andrew Jackson, the father of the Democratic Party. Obviously, it is illegal today; it was simply a metaphor and I meant no physical harm to Gattine,” he said. Gattine did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the incident, but he told the Press Herald that LePage’s voicemail was “inappropriate and uncalled for.”“What I said to the television reporter today is that the kind of racially charged comments the governor made are not at all helpful in solving what the real problem is,” Gattine told the Press Herald. “And that is, we have a crisis in the state of Maine of people overdosing on heroin and prescription drugs and we are not doing enough with respect to treatment and prevention.”After leaving the voicemail, LePage publicly attacked Gattine and invited a television crew and Press Herald reporter for an interview in which he said he wished he could duel Gattine.“When a snot-nosed little guy from Westbrook calls me a racist, now I’d like him to come up here because, tell you right now, I wish it were 1825,” he said, according to the Press Herald. “And we would have a duel, that’s how angry I am, and I would not put my gun in the air, I guarantee you, I would not be (Alexander) Hamilton. I would point it right between his eyes, because he is a snot-nosed little runt and he has not done a damn thing since he’s been in this Legislature to help move the state forward.”LePage and Gattine have clashed on a number of issues, according to the Press Herald, including the governor’s effort to get rid of food stamps in his state.LePage’s voicemail prompted Westbrook’s mayor, council president and school committee chair to write an open letter to the people of Maine condemning their governor. “Once more Governor LePage has humiliated himself and the Office of the Governor. He continues to again embarrass the citizens of this wonderful State,” they wrote. “LePage’s voicemail to Representative Gattine is so outrageous it is beyond our ability to know how to respond. Furthermore, his threat to want to ‘shoot him between the eyes’ would be reprehensible coming from anybody, but from the individual holding the position of Governor of our State is insanity.”Democratic leaders in the state legislature said the comments showed LePage was not fit to hold office.Gattine wasn’t the only target of LePage this week. On Wednesday, he called Khizr Khan, the father of a killed American soldier, a “con artist” for criticizing GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.This post has been updated with a statement LePage released Friday and a letter from officials in Westbrook to the people of Maine."

Is that how this felt when you were performing and recording this concert?Todd Rundgren: Yeah, but not necessarily in those terms. In recent years, I’ve been experimenting with different musical forms and different ways to present myself. As a result, there are things that don’t get played. I’ll put it that way. One of the paradoxes of having a career in which you continue to create as opposed to resting on your laurels all the time is that fan favorites from decades ago don’t get played as often, or if they do get played, I sometimes readapt them to a style that I might be dabbling in. It reached a certain point where I felt like I had toyed with my audience for long enough and would just give them the more familiar stuff in a way that was more familiar, as opposed to just rearranging things. On any particular night, we have a list of fifty songs and I’ll pick about half of them to perform. Even though the release is a document of a particular evening, it isn’t necessarily representative of any other particular evening, it’s just the songs we decided to play that particular night. On that tour and on the recent tours that I’ve done with this show, the set list is different every night, both because we as players will get bored with it if we keep playing the same thing every night, and also I have fans who sometimes show up to more than one show, and that gives them an opportunity to hear more material than would fit into a single show.MR: How are you satisfying yourself creatively these days and how are you bringing your fans along with the live experience?TR: The dichotomy goes back to more or less the beginning of my career. I put together a band and the band lasted about eighteen months and put two records together over the course of it. After that experience, I still wanted to be involved in the music business but I didn’t like the politics of being in a musical group. I wasn’t comfortable fronting an act of my own at that point. I was a guitar player in a band. The first thing I did after the band broke up was get into engineering and production, before I recorded a solo album. That became a very successful avocation for me, to the point where when I was making my own records, I made them for me. I paid no attention to how the audience would respond. My first record was very eclectic and all over the map, the next one was a little bit more coherent. By the time I got to the third one, I had gotten my songwriting chops to a point where I had like three hit records off of Something/Anything?. At that point, the expectation was that I was going to slave in that mine for the rest of my career and milk the success of that. Well, because unlike most artists, I did not depend on my records and the success thereof for my livelihood. I was making plenty of money producing other people’s records right after Something/Anything? I decided I wanted to do something different, and I put out an album called A Wizard, A True Star and at that point, probably lost half of my entire audience. There were no hit singles off of it but that more or less defined the pattern that I would follow for the rest of my career, which is, “Whatever I did on that record you just heard, whether you liked it or not, the next one is likely not to be anything like it.” The audience that I developed over the years has grown to expect the unexpected. That’s part of the appeal. It’s something that has kind of gone out of music as the years have gone by, mostly because record labels like to have consistent and understandable product to move to the audience. Everyone sort of forgets the times when The Beatles were going through endless mutations and adopting new musical forms and discarding them. That to me was what was most exciting about the band; “What are they going to do next? What is this next record going to hold?” The people who have stuck with me probably have somewhat the same attitude. They would be perhaps a little disappointed if I suddenly settled down and stated making the same kind of record over and over again, and worst of all, appeared to be pandering to them in the process.MR: Fellow Huffington Post contributor, Sal Nunziato, has a question for you: “It’s been twenty years since you’ve used a band on a record, is there any chance of seeing that happen again?TR: As a matter of fact, the principal reason why I haven’t been using a band is more geographic than anything. When I moved out to Kauai, it just made it difficult to call a session with the players I’m used to playing with, being at least a five-hour flight from the West Coast. It made me go back to the way I initially made records, which was doing most all of it myself. For some reason labels keep coming to me and asking me to do more records, so I’ve been recently contracted to do another record by the end of the year. This time, I’ve decided that it’s going to be a much more collaborative effort, although that doesn’t necessarily mean I’m putting a band together and going in to the studio in that old-fashioned, typical ensemble kind of way. These are going to be contributors from all over the world, so a lot of this will be done the way that a lot of music is made nowadays. We send the elements to each other and we make our contributions and then send them back. So yes, this will be a collaborative record and there will be many other players on it but it won’t necessarily be a band.MR: When performing live, are there any songs you can’t wait to get to?TR: Well, I guess you could say that some songs still have a certain resonance for me. The hardest ones are the ones from the very early parts of my career. I have a terrifically hard time getting into “Hello, It’s Me,” being the very first song I ever wrote and likely one of the ones that I play as much as any other song. It’s certainly a song that people enjoy hearing because they can also sing along to it. There are those chorus parts and it’s simple and to many, it represents an era when music was different. I’ve come to realize that the purpose of this kind of presentation, going back and reviving older material, has more to do with transporting people in the audience back to another time in their lives. They often remember the first time they heard a song or some significant event that occurred to them in which the song was part of the context. In that sense, it isn’t so much them in the present enjoying how we do the song so much as them in some sort of reverie, regressing to an earlier time. While that is certainly a valid expectation―that when you go to a show you would have that sort of experience―but once again, I caution the audience not to come with those sort of expectations, because that moment may not occur. If I didn’t feel like I was creating new moments that later you might have reveries about, I would probably give it up altogether. I’m not the kind of artist who could be contented to simply repeat the past. There’s too much music happening around me for me to feel like I’m not involved in it somehow.MR: Todd, what advice do you have for new artists?TR: The miracle of technology has eliminated a lot of the barriers that used to exist when I first started out. You had to go to a studio that usually the record label you were auditioning for owned. They would give you a half an hour or an hour to perform essentially live as many songs as you could get down on tape. That was usually the singular vehicle. There were other ways, I suppose. There were A&R men who would go out and see an act live and say, “Sign ‘em up,” but often, you had to go around and actually make audition tapes, different ones for every label. You couldn’t take the tapes with you after you had made them, you had to replay the songs for RCA and for Columbia and for Atlantic. I don’t know how many of those sessions we did before we eventually got signed, but it had little to do with our ability to actually perform in front of an audience, but our ability to make record. Things have changed, that whole sort of gatekeeper status that the record label had, because they owned all the equipment. That’s all disappeared. Kids nowadays have their own studios in their laptops. Crap, you can have it in your iPad or your phone at this point. There are no creative barriers any longer. You don’t have to try and get into anybody else’s expensive studio and do as much as you can in a limited amount of time. You have all the resources you need and all the time in the world to work on it. Then there are the other aspects, once you had a final product, the function of the label was to promote it, get people to play it on the radio, and take out ads in magazines so that people would know there was such a thing as your record. Now you’ve got YouTube. You don’t need anything else to promote yourself. I know of artists who essentially have no label. In some cases, they don’t even sell music. They just promote themselves over YouTube and make all their money at the gigs―fees at the gigs and selling merchandise. This is actually very curious, because it’s pre-label. It’s almost back to the time before recording existed. There is not that necessity, nor even the desire to have some corporate entity suddenly controlling everything you do. I don’t have to give kids advice nowadays if they’ve got the inspiration to make music. There is no impediment to them getting the resources to make it, and there’s no impediment to them getting it into the public eye, and there are all these social media networks where you can actually build your own promotion team, people who will go out and hype you to other people for free. How do you make the money? You’ve got to go out and play live. I think regardless of whatever music you make, you’ve got to go out and play live, make T-shirts and stuff. That’s how you make a living. You don’t actually make a living selling music in that old-fashioned sense. I think that’s incredibly liberating. For artists who grew up in the era of the big labels, they still think of music as being a “thing,” something that’s etched into a piece of plastic and wrapped in cardboard, but music isn’t anything except when it’s being played, when it vibrates the air and enters your eardrum. We’ve returned back to the basics, I think. We just have this space-age way of getting the word out and promoting it.MR: Sal Nunziato has another question for you: “Is the project with The Roots still happening?TR: Yes, it is ongoing. It’s just that they get busy and I get busy. It was never a project that had some sort of aegis behind it, we just started doing it because we had a mutual admiration and we’re all from Philadelphia. They started sending me some tracks, I started writing songs for them and singing them. That process will continue but it doesn’t necessarily have any deadline. We hope to complete it by sometime next year, but right now, it’s become somewhat of a lesser priority because we have this record under contract that we have to finish.Transcribed by Galen HawthorneKRIEF’S “DEO GRATIAS” EXCLUSIVEMontreal-based Krief, aka Patrick Krief―former lead guitarist and vocalist with The Dears―shares a lyric video to his new single “Deo Gratias” directed by Christopher Mills (Modest Mouse, Interpol). The song is taken off of his forthcoming double album Automanic, which will be released September 30 on Culvert Music.According to the lyric video’s director, Christopher Mills...“The snare drum rim shot buried in Patrick’s lush production of ‘Deo Gratias’ felt like an old clock to me. I the instrumentation made me think of gears and bells, and Patrick’s soft, haunting voice made me think of a ghost inside a clock, waiting and longing. I also liked the idea that the video could have twitches to it―a bit like some kind of time lapse, or film-gate type of thing, so I projected Patrick’s image, and the lyrics into the curved glass of the clock, and used the abstract blur to create the ‘twitches’ that come at unexpected moments, and to build the final composite of these very simple ideas, loosely assembled to back this lush song.”ALEXIS & THE SAMURAI’S “DOGS” EXCLUSIVEAccording to Alexis & the Samurai’s Sam Craft... “’Dogs’ is the tale of two Great Danes that Alexis and I used to have in our old house in Mid-City, New Orleans. Well, they weren’t our pups; they were our roommates’. One dog was a sassy black princess who didn’t take any crap from anybody and the other was a big, dumb drool machine who tried to eat the floor a lot. One day, when I was home alone, the princess got out. Great Danes are huge animals and have the land speed of a gazelle, so I was terrified that I was gonna discover a pile of dog guts on the street and that their owners were gonna turn me into a pile of human guts on the street. I panicked and asked this wise, old Irish dude next door if he had seen the dog. He said no, but added, in a thick brogue, ‘Use the dumb dog to lead ye to the smart ‘un.’ Sure enough, I put him on a leash and that awkward-yet-loyal goofball led me right to his sister who was up to no good about two blocks away. I thought this tale of ‘doggus ex machina’ would make for a good song. In our duo, Alexis often leads our music into interesting new territory and I get to follow my nose and pull the arrangements along to catch up.” A Conversation with Don McLeanMike Ragogna: It’s been many years, you’ve had many hits, you’ve had a career that many would be envious of, and yet here we are talking once again about American Pie. Don, does it ever get old?Don McLean: It’s a little like Groundhog Day. When I was younger, I fought it for a while. I had a couple other hits and it didn’t change anything, so I began to realize this is it, it’s always going to be this way. No matter what I do, I’ll never really top the power of that song for people, and the importance of it for people. As an old guy now―I’m going to be seventy-one in a few months―believe me, I’m really glad to have it. There are a lot of people who have a lot of hit records who can’t get arrested and here I am with this song and I can work and do whatever I want.MR: And the album will be re-released on vinyl. Is it fun to see the delivery system change back to vinyl these days?DM: There’s one thought that I have on that. Let’s say you go and buy a Beach Boys album that was put out in 1964, an album like The Beach Boys Today!. You get this album and you bring it home and you play it. That is the last word that Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys had on that recording. That is it. If you buy a CD of that record, somebody else has fooled with that. They’ve changed the EQ slightly or they’ve maybe remixed something or fooled with it. If you listen to something like “Salt Lake City” on the CD and then you listen to it on the vinyl, you will hear a big difference because people will screw around with these, putting them on CD. They think they’re improving them, but they never do. The original people made them the way they were supposed to be. So that’s one difference, but whether or not they pressed the new vinyl to the old tapes is the question. My sense is that they’ve probably enhanced the tapes somewhat before they make these new pressings.MR: You’re absolutely right about that. But also, many times, cutting masters were used to accommodate flaws in the mixes, things they decided to play with without going back and doing more mixes. And they had to accommodate for the problems of the medium, the needle moving to the center of the eventual vinyl, where the recordings lost bass progressively. When labels moved to CD reissues, they initially used cutting masters but eventually went back to the original masters. I think that’s where all of this got confusing years later when pulling tapes and remastering for new product. DM: And if you remaster a song, you can change that song a lot. Mastering is something where you take the master tapes and pull out frequencies and enhance or change the basic feel of the bass or the mid-range or the high end. You’re not remixing, but you’re basically pulling out frequencies and making them more prominent. If you remaster even the original tapes from the way they were mastered originally, you can change the way they sound a lot.MR: When you look at American Pie, the LP has many highlights, and is considered a classic singer-songwriter album. What was it about your creative process that made the album so iconic?DM: I think Ed Freeman got a very good sound. I don’t even know how to describe it, he worked very hard on it. And I was at the top of my game. I was also up against a wall because my record company had folded. I was in the middle of making the American Pie record when Mediarts went under. They put out my first album, Tapestry. I didn’t know where I was going to go or what was going to happen to me. I was just working frantically on this album, and then all of a sudden, this white knight in the form of United Artists Records rode in and said, “We have bought Mediarts and we’re going to continue this project and we’re also going to give you a big advance.” That was amazing. I lived off of that for like two years. I was able to finish it, thank God, without having to pay for it myself or whatever. One of the things you have to remember is that millions of people bought that record, or still buy it, so really, every song on there―“Babylon,” “Crossroads,” “Winterwood,” “Sister Fatima,” “Vincent,” “American Pie”―they’re all famous to people. They know those songs. The same goes for a lot of the “best-ofs” I’ve put out that have songs from other albums. There’s a way of getting around that big “American Pie” roadblock and getting a lot of other songs into people’s minds as the years go by, if you’re able to survive long enough. One thing I wanted to say is this song is really worth about four or five number one records. It’s got so many parts to it and so many bits and pieces that get quoted that it’s really this big behemoth of a song. It’s not like having just one hit, it’s like having a bunch.MR: It’s not only quoted all the time but it must be nice to have contributed colloquial terms to the culture such as “the day the music died” through that song.DM: Yeah. There was another song on there, “Everybody Loves Me, Baby,” which was not produced as well as it could’ve been and I always thought that could’ve also been a hit song. A lot of people used phrases from that back in the seventies. It’s just a remarkable thing and I’m really thankful that I was able to do it and be part of something that is going to be remembered. Frankly, it brought so much fame to me so fast that it was really all I could handle.MR: Do you feel that having spent some creatively formative years with Pete Seeger added to how you approached music?DM: I have a number of influences and I’ll tell you who they are. Josh White, Pete Seeger, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and to some degree, Buddy Holly. Those five people influenced what I did, and from there, I made a style that was an amalgam of pop, folk and rock ‘n’ roll. If you listen to my version of “Crying,” I’m singing with Elvis Presley’s original group, The Jordanaires. Bob Moore, Pete Drake on the steel guitar, Ray Edenton on the acoustic guitar... He used to do all the Everly Brothers records. There’s a thing that’s connected to me and goes all the way back. As far as Pete Seger goes, getting to know him and be around him for six or seven years, it was different from all those other people because I got to see how he operated and I got to see how he did things. And I got to learn that mistakes are okay, because he made them all the time. I was a little bit of a perfectionist. I still am. I think I was more concerned about making mistakes before I knew Seeger. That was an important thing. Programming was another thing he was very good at―juxtaposing one song to another. Also, idiomatic mastery. He didn’t have a set list that he followed every night, he made it up as he went along, and that’s what I do. I’ll sing the five or six songs that people want to hear most of the time and then I’ll have songs from the album that they know. Then I’ll have songs that I just feel like singing that night, and then esoteric songs that they may have heard once and are worth hearing again. But I will never do the same show twice. I have never done the same line-up of songs twice ever in fifty years, and that comes from him.MR: Beautiful. Do you think it’s also because another of the skills you’ve learned from him is how to read the audience?DM: Exactly. I know one singer songwriter who is very famous, I’m a fan of his and I won’t name him, but he admitted that he does two different shows―one is seventy five-minutes and one is ninety minutes and they’re always exactly the same. Some people operate that way, but I don’t. I like to read the audience and see where I can take them. A lot of times, I’ll add songs and work them out with the band during sound check, we might do it for three days in a row and on the fourth day I’ll use the song. I’ll read whether or not the band really gets the song, and then I’ll lay it on the audience at some point and that makes it new.MR: So there’s constant reinvention and adding to your track list.DM: All the time.MR: You’ve had a wonderful lifetime of performance and recording, with hopefully much more to come. What are the biggest growths you’ve experienced in both of those areas?DM: With this package, there’s going to be another package of the original CD with songs that were recorded during the making of the album. And there’s going to be a DVD of Don McLean at Royal Albert Hall in 1973, and a CD of the songs from that performance. That thing that I was doing back then when I became famous was really the folk Pete Seeger thing that I think evolved into doing a two-guitar thing with a great guitar player, John Platania, which we ended up doing for about fifteen years. Then I went from there to doing a trio and then having five guys on stage and being able to sing any song I want to sing and have it be any way that I want it. So that’s been the evolution I think as I’ve gone along.MR: Are there things you’ve discovered about yourself as the writer of “American Pie” all these years later when you’re looking at it, maybe discovering the psychology of what went on during the writing of that song?DM: No, I knew exactly what I was writing about. I knew exactly what I was doing and I knew that it would be timeless because I know America. I hate to say that, it sounds very egotistical, but I just knew what I was doing. People say, “Don’t you want to update it?” No, it’s exactly what it should be and it’ll always be the same. It’s the same little prophetic story. It’s funny but one of the things if you want to connect my answer to that question would be to say, “Well, people lip-sync on stage every night, they make records with machines and not with people, the songs have become very rudimentary.” I would say, and that’s giving it a lot more credit than it deserves...not very musical, very repetitive. So music, in a sense, the way I knew it, has died. Songwriting the way we knew it is not alive as an art form anymore. That’s the part that surprises me. I never thought that would happen.MR: Well, in “American Pie,” you wrote, “Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry.” You also grew up in a period when people were encouraged to be literate, when there wasn’t a lot of distraction except limited forms of entertainment.DM: One of the things that I have noticed and that I tell people sometimes in interviews is that when I grew up, it was very quiet. The TV wasn’t on; the radio may have been on once in a while. If the phone rang, there was no answering machine. It was important and if it rang late at night, it was really important. Not a lot of cars, not a lot of people. Under Kennedy, the population was a hundred and sixty million. Now it’s three hundred and fifty millions. In the cities and the suburbs, they’re jammed-in with cars, but in those days, it was very quiet. You were able to think. As a child, I remember being able to sit in my room or wherever I was and fantasize things and think. I think that I developed a level of concentration, as everybody else did, that was reflected in the quality of the schoolwork the kids did and the quality of the educations that people got because concentration was demanded. Now it’s very fragmented. It’s very difficult to concentrate; people are very bored. They’re very jumpy if they’re not being titillated all the time with bits and pieces of useless information. That’s what I love about “Satisfaction.” That song really talks about where we are now. Everyone’s looking for satisfaction and a lot of it is sexual. That’s an amazing song in terms of what the lyrics say from back in 1962 and it’s exactly appropriate from the way things are now, I think.MR: Was “Vincent” written to that point?DM: I don’t really know how I did that song. I looked at the painting “Starry Night.” I read several books about Van Gogh and, of course, like everyone, I always knew his paintings. But the idea hit me to do the song. I took the imagery, I wanted to get in the song itself a swirling flow like the wind, almost. I think Ed Freeman’s beautiful string arrangement that comes in at the end of the song gives you that feeling like the wind coming through the window and rustling the curtains. This is the thing about the kind of music I want to make; it is the expression of that which is inexpressible. When you smell a flower, or when you notice a person’s scent, or their demeanor, there are so many things going on, subtle messages that are being sent to you all the time. Music is supposed to do that. It should do that, I think, especially if you’re a singer-songwriter, because you’re personally performing the song. I frankly want to say that I’ve always thought of myself as a singer first and a songwriter second. If you hear “Since I Don’t Have You” or “Castles In The Air” or “The Mountains Of Mourne” or “Crying,” I’m a singer first and I happen to be lucky to have the ability to write some songs once in a while, but I’m not this ridiculously prolific songwriter who writes all the time. Steve Allen wrote five thousand songs. I write very personal songs and make very personal, eclectic recordings that fortunately, a few have become famous and made me famous, but I didn’t start out wanting to do that. I wanted to write the most beautiful, interesting things I could do and see them through. Each song is different, there’s no repetition in the styles of the songs. If you look at the hundred and fifty songs I’ve recorded, they’re all different. I don’t repeat myself. I like to create wonderful babies in different styles. “Dreidl” is different from “Vincent.” I do this all the time. I like to change everything. MR: I’m assuming you consider yourself still learning?DM: Well, I’m trying. I’m always realizing that everything that happens to me is grist to the mill. There are thought and realizations and understanding that come along. I think that success and money can make you complacent. I do have a new album called Botanical Gardens coming out, which is a whole other thing. The songs on that are very different from songs I’ve written in the past. I’m still creating and doing this.MR: What advice do you have for new artists?DM: It’s a very practical bit of advice: Find yourself a very good transactional lawyer who can tell you exactly what it is you’re signing when you sign a record contract or a contract with a manager or any kind of contract. I think a lot of young artists get so excited by the women and the applause and the fun of travel and fame. Behind the scenes, there are professional music people who know how to steal everything you have and they can do it very effectively with a contract. That’s the advice I’d give. If you make it in this business, you have to have a very good lawyer who can tell you what it is that you’re signing and what’s good about it and what’s bad about it, and then you can make an informed decision about whether or not you want to do that. I say this because you can’t change this. The covenants in a contract are like the covenants that are run with real estate, and they’re run for decades and you can’t change it once it’s locked in, so it is important to know what you’re signing. I think that would tend to avoid a lot of heartache if you’re going to make it. Of course, if you’re not going to make it, you’re not going to make it. There was a friend of mine named Nick Reynolds and he sang in The Kingston Trio. We were talking once and I said, “I paid some dues but not a lot of dues,” and he said, “Well, we paid some dues but not a lot of dues,” and then he thought for a moment and said, “Well, if you pay too many dues, you probably don’t have a lot of talent.”MR: [laughs] You were friends with Jim Croce, right?DM: I really was. We were friends in college. I went to Villanova, I was a freshman and he was a junior and he was sort of the big man on campus―and that was a big campus, like five thousand students. He found me somehow because he always found everybody who could play banjo and guitar, and the word got around that I was a good guitar player and a singer and a banjo picker. He found me and started to hang around with me and I was a nobody. We got to be pretty good friends. He even got me a little radio show on the campus radio station, just something to do. I didn’t particularly like school all that much. Then later on, I became famous pretty quickly in 1969 and he was still wondering what he was going to do with his life. He thought he was going to be a psychologist. I think he had a master’s in psychology, very smart, but he had a dream. Next thing I know, there he was, the Jim Croce who everybody knows, who was not the guy who I knew in college. It was totally like a new character he created, with the cigar and the whole bit. But he was in his element, he discovered himself. He was an interesting guy, he was very smart, he was very well-educated, he was very funny. He could’ve been a standup comedian without even being a musician, and he knew how to cut hit records, so he would’ve been big.MR: It must have been very flattering to find out that Lori Lieberman through Gimbel and Fox wrote “Killing Me Softly With His Song” about you. What was it like hearing that song for the first time?DM: It was very beautiful. I’ve met her and she’s very beautiful and a lovely person. She tells this story of exactly how that song came to be. You know, I’ve had so many wonderful things happen to me. If I were a guy who had five Grammys and more hits, I’d almost rather have my career than anybody else’s. I’ve had all this connection to music, songs written about me, and my songs recorded by many, many really major artists. It’s funny because when Obama was inaugurated the first time, my whole family and I were watching television and there was this concert and out comes [Pete] Seeger with [Bruce] Springsteen and they sing “This Land Is Your Land.” Then out comes Garth Brooks who sings “American Pie.” I thought to myself, “My God, look what’s happened to me.” It’s amazing. I was a kid who had dreams and like Marilyn Monroe said, “They all had dreams, but I dreamed the hardest.”MR: You mentioned the new album. What else are you doing in the future?DM: I’m building a new life for myself. I’m recording and traveling and planning all kinds of things. We’re re-releasing various videos, the latest one is the “Starry Starry Night” video with Nancy Griffith recorded with a big orchestra for PBS in 1999 or 2000, and then there’s this show, the Manchester concert. That’s another one that’s been found and put out. The next thing we’re going to do are these live Cork concerts in Ireland, stadium shows that I did in the early 1980s. Then there’s also the American Troubadour documentary movie and CD, which gets shown around the world quite a bit, so there’s a video thing going on. I’m going to get the new album out next year and there are a bunch of other tracks that I recorded in Nashville for another album that I’ll put somewhere. I’m not quite sure how I’m going to use that but I’ll keep rolling along. There’s even a little documentary movie about the making of Botanical Gardens, which we’ve got to work on a little bit and probably put on YouTube. It’s just a lot of things going on.MR: Oh yeah, forgot to ask. What advice would you give to Don McLean when he was starting out?DM: I think what I would’ve done differently would be to know and enjoy other artists more. I think in my life, I was a bit too singular, a bit too detached. I’m sorry that that’s the way it is. I don’t know why that was but I was always sort of a lonesome character and I think that was probably something I shouldn’t have done.MR: But that’s not Don McLean in 2016, right?DM: No. I’m a lot more open.Transcribed by Galen HawthorneRED TAIL RING’S GIBSON TOWN” EXCLUSIVEAccording to Red Tail Ring’s Michael Beauchamp“Laurel and I went to a citywide vigil following the Kalamazoo shooting this past February. The vigil crowd overflowed into Bronson Park after filling up every square inch of the downtown church. The shootings had been brutal on the community―eight people shot, six of them killed, in a single night. That night, Laurel and I were so moved by the solidarity of the community, and so pissed off by the pointlessness of the killings, we walked straight home and wrote the lyrics in a few hours after basing the melody on Muddy Waters’ ‘Catfish Blues,’ and recorded it a week later.”A Conversation with Sean CalleryMike Ragogna: Sean you’ve been nominated for an Emmy virtually every year that the series 24 existed. What was it like being part of such a powerhouse?It is crazy to think I wrote the music for the first episode 15 years ago. No one had any idea at the time if 24 would be a success, and given that I was a very untested and unknown composer, I was frankly just trying to keep everyone happy and stay employed. I was very lucky that executive producer Joel Surnow believed in me and fought for me to be the composer of the series.It wasn’t until season 2 that I had a sense that the show was becoming more popular. I think it was the first series to release its first season on DVD in between seasons 1 and 2 and as a result our fan base grew. It was first time I ever heard the term “binge watching.” When social media started arriving into our culture around 2003-2004, it introduced newer avenues of communication and interaction between fans like never before.MR: Did the show’s music demands teach you any new skills and how did the music evolve over the years?SC: There was a lot of music to compose per episode, and as the minute count rose each season, I think my hair got a little grayer. The first skill I had to learn―and continue to learn―is managing the emotions of panic and so on. That might sound like a joke, but it’s not. There are times when you have huge deadlines and you know things have to get done, but on some days you have no creative ‘gas in the tank’, so to speak, and you can become anxious. Any kind of creativity requires being in the present moment and remaining engaged, and panic is the opposite of that. So for me the journey is about managing those moments as best you can so you can return to the work at hand, and (dare I suggest it) enjoy the ride.MR: You created the main theme music for Marvel’s Jessica Jones. Do you find there’s a difference in the creative process when writing for a series like that and let’s say Bones, which tends to be more lighthearted despite the crimes?SC: For me, the creative process is more of an ongoing path, connecting your own artistic instincts to the needs of the show you’re writing for, and trusting these instincts more and more each time. I try to strengthen this connection as I get older. You utilize the skills you’ve learned along the way―while learning new ones as well―in order to make your most authentic contribution possible. This is true whether it’s for Bones, Jessica Jones, Homeland and another other project.The tools that you utilize in composing for each show, however, will often be different. This is the craft part of the process. With Bones, for example, I did not have a lot of experience writing more lighthearted fare―“24” certainly didn’t have much and I was very interested in exploring that kind of writing. It required a different kind of musical style and skill set using different instruments. Oddly enough, the visual effects on Bones are much more graphic and disturbing than those on “24.” Every Bones episode features some kind of decomposing―and often disgusting looking―corpse, but the humorous tone of the show makes these visuals accessible and less disturbing than, let’s say, Jack Bauer pulling a severed head out of a duffel bag.MR: What’s your musical training and how much of it do you find yourself utilizing for most of your work?SC: I was trained as a classical pianist as a kid. I walked to my piano lessons up the street at the home of Mrs. Hornby, who was probably pushing 90 when I walked through her door at the age of six. She had a little stuffed Beethoven doll on the piano that kind of gave me the creeps, but she was a great teacher. Later on I attended college at the New England Conservatory in Boston. All students were required to study history and theory, which was great because I had more than a few holes in my training and education growing up in Rhode Island. I had not ever heard the music of Stravinsky until I was 17 years old.At night, I played solo piano in restaurants and bars, and also for weddings with a jazz group. These jobs were a lot of fun, and that style of playing came in handy when I began composing for Jessica Jones, which incorporated the use of jazz infused sonorities and styles. I was briefly a music director for Olivia Newton-John, and did a brief stint as a musician at Disney World. I designed Cardassian spaceship warp sounds and alien phaser shots for a couple of the Star Trek television shows. Later on I worked for a computer music synthesis company which pioneered the use of the first digital recorders and samplers. Each gig, musical or not, allowed me to learn a skill set of some sort that I was able to put to use in scoring.MR: Can you give some examples of how you creatively approach each of the series you score?SC: The simplest way to describe it is that I pay close attention to what I’m feeling when reading a script or seeing a picture cut for the very first time; noticing the emotions and the energies that come in play, because in those first moments whatever comes up is completely genuine and pure, regardless of whether it makes any intellectual sense. I pay attention to those moments because that’s most likely the place from where I’ll start composing. It’s connecting to an untouched truth of sorts—from the heart, before the analytical/problem solving part of your mind gets involved. It’s hard to describe these things and make sense, but I hope it comes across.Jessica Jones was unique because I was only allowed to look at still images from the pilot episode―not moving picture-at first. I was put in a dark room and shown slides of Jessica Jones [Krysten Ritter], Kilgrave [David Tennant], her apartment, the street she lived on, Luke’s Bar, her neighbor’s place, the grungy hallway, the gritty streets, Trish’s apartment, everything. I couldn’t take the images offsite with me; I could only take down notes. From there, I came back to the studio and started finding the melodies that would eventually become the musical theme of the series. Seeing the still images―verses moving images―was somehow more informative to me. Perhaps the imagination comes more into play with still images.MR: Since you’ve worked on so many series and nominated for many Emmys, what keeps scoring satisfying for you at this point? Do you ever consider how far you’ve come as a composer/arranger and what does that do for you?SC: My personal belief it that there is a primal satisfaction that comes from learning something new, and this almost always involves the willingness to break your comfort zones over and over again as you try out new things. This is what keeps me engaged―when I am not being lazy and procrastinating! In recent years, also, I have been teaching at a workshop at NYU with new composers, and I have enjoyed that very much because you meet new people and interact more with others and make new friends and colleagues along the way. You hear amazing work, new ideas, and you are inspired by it all. My Mom was a science high school teacher back in Rhode Island and so perhaps some of her energy is with me a bit―except I do not wear a lab coat.MR: Do you have a favorite show to work on and why?SC: The safest answer is to say that I love them all, which happens to be true, and I would hate to highlight one series at the expense of another. Having said that, when I’m having a challenging day I absolutely love watching Johnny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes on Elementary. His performance just brings a smile to my face. I am amazed at all the technical things actors have to go through in order to create a natural performance, and Mr. Miller’s take on such an iconic character is extraordinary. I really hope he gets an Emmy nod one day for his work on this series. And for Lucy Liu too! They are fantastic together.MR: Are you able to escape the reruns of scenes you’ve been working on once you leave the office? What’s your technique for doing that?SC: I love ‘80s arcade games. There is a place in downtown Los Angeles called Eighty-Two, which features the classic games from that era, along with pinball machines. Nothing shakes loose a burdensome work issue better than a few games of Robotron 2084.MR: What advice do you have for new artists?SC: Speaking from my own experiences, I find that expressing one’s truth involves connecting with and opening the heart. Doing this takes much practice, and it requires a willingness to be vulnerable, which can bring fear and discomfort. Fears arise about everything, from thoughts about how we will make a living, to relationships, to wondering if you have any talent at all. Everyone—even the most successful among us—feels this way from time to time.A kind of fearlessness is needed to navigate forward. This is not to say that the goal is to expunge fear or to conquer it somehow. The notion is that you can become more acquainted and connected with your fear when it arises and not fall apart. We can become more comfortable with the messiness and embarrassment of it all. It’s a tender spot that you touch over and over, and each time one does this, an inner confidence and trust is created, and from that, a genuineness and authenticity emerges in one’s art. It is most certainly not an easy path; I practice every day to bring about that kind of compassion with oneself.MR: Any advice for the younger Sean Callery?SC: Be humble and focused, keep cultivating your talent for when you’ll need it on a moment’s notice, and learn learn, learn. Composers are always looking for smart and talented assistants and it’s not as easy finding the right people as one might think. Mentor / assistant relationships are good stepping stones for learning and refining your craft (I worked for Mark Snow years ago and it was an invaluable experience).Reach out gently to the people you’d like to work with. Reach out via email. Not all will respond but some do; I do eventually. Follow up every 4-6 weeks, not every day. Have patience in the process of reaching out and establishing relationships. Identify what is it about you that is unique and valuable to the person you want to work with. You are a great orchestrator perhaps? You are a whiz at Protools or some other studio skill? You are an incredible guitarist or singer maybe? These things are all valuable to know.MR: What’s in the future for you?SC: I am currently composing for a new series on ABC called Designated Survivor starring Kiefer Sutherland. It is the story about an untested lower level cabinet secretary who ascends to the Presidency after a catastrophic event. I think it’s a wonderful show and I hope people will enjoy it.JOHN BROWN’S BODY’S “WHO PAID THEM OFF” EXCLUSIVEAccording to John Brown’s Body...“’Who Paid Them Off’ is simply a song about the futility of our political system. Most of us are good law-abiding citizens who are constantly amazed at the incompetence and disingenuousness of our elected officials. The song is just a fantasy about calling people out on their bulls**t.”A Conversation with Jeff RussoMike Ragogna: Jeff, your rock group Tonic was Grammy-nominated and sold millions of recordings. You also scored many hit television series including Fargo, Power, and The Returned, and you continue to supply the music for American Gothic, The Night Of and Legion. How can you create music for so many simultaneous programs? Do you have help?Jeff Russo: I do have a great team. 2 assistants, an orchestrator, a score coordinator, engineer/mixer, music editor, and someone who makes sure we all eat. It takes a village! The thing about working on multiple things is that it sounds like way more than it actually is at any one given moment. There are definitely overlaps, and that’s when it can get tricky, but it can also help the creative process. When I get stuck on something, I can shift over to a completely different project with a different tone, and feel and musicality, and it can shake loose new ideas. The main thing, though, is time management. It seems I have to consistently write about 6-7 minutes a day on average to keep up in the very busy times. I can be a big procrastinator so that doesn’t help. Oh, and Facebook doesn’t help either! MR: When did you begin scoring and how did you make those contacts, etc.?JR: In 2006, my band was taking a break and I was trying to figure out what to do. My dear friend, Wendy Melvoin, asked me if I wanted to hang out at [Wendy & Lisa’s] studio to see what they were doing. I already had an interest in scoring for narrative and media since I had played guitar on a movie score some years before that. I ended up never leaving their studio. They had me assisting and editing and straightening up. Then I was helping set up sessions, and before I knew it, they asked if I wanted to write a cue. At that moment I was hooked. It wasn’t too long after that when I started to try to get my own gigs. About 2 years later I met Noah Hawley when he was looking for a composer for a show he had written called “The Unusuals.” MR: How do you approach each show thematically, for instance, American Gothic versus Legion? Do producers utilize you for your style or versatility?JR: I always like to start with reading the script/s and begin sketching ideas for various themes. The earlier you start the better. Once those themes are set, applying them to the underscore is easier. The two shows you mention couldn’t be more different, but the starting places are similar. I like to find the emotional center of a story and work from there. Once you figure out what the heart of a story is, working from that comes a bit faster. MR: Which shows have you scored that you feel the music impacts the most? Which shows have affected you the most personally once you’ve seen how the music is sewn to the scenes?JR: Fargo, for me, has the most impact. We tend to let the music do its thing, which allows music to have a life in the show. It feels almost like another character of the show, but less of a narrator. I think both Fargo and The Night Of have had the most impact on me when I sat back and watched the music in the show and how it became part of the fabric.MR: Is there anything in your musical education that hinted at your one day scoring projects? JR: Not really. I’m mostly untrained and self taught. I remember listening to classical music with my dad as a kid, but I quickly moved on to playing drums and guitar in a rock band. The only thing I can think of is that I studied acting a bit when I was in high school with the most fascinating teacher named Tony Abeson. I think that has filtered down to what I do now with writing music for narrative. He taught about being honest in storytelling and connecting that to experience. Perhaps that helps me understand how help with telling the story. MR: Do you watch other television series and fantasize what it would be like with your music? JR: Not really. I try to just let the show be what it is. I’m thrilled at how good TV music has become.  MR: Do you have a favorite scene from a series or particular scene from any show that you’ve worked on?JR: There is a scene in Fargo, year 2, that I really enjoyed working. In Episode 8, Peggy is watching an old Ronald Reagan movie on a small B&W TV, and then we sort of go into the movie. I had to create the score for the movie. That was really fun. It had to sound like a an old ‘40s war picture. MR: You’re Grammy and Emmy-nominated. What does that do to your self-perception? Does anything change after each nomination?JR: It’s so great to be recognized by your peers. It really is an honor, and for a second you sit there and go, “Wow this is awesome.” But then the self loathing comes back and I wonder how I’m going to write that next cue, and maybe I’m not the right guy for this or that and so forth. MR: How do you balance your rock career with Tonic and the demands of scoring a TV series?JR: Recently there hasn’t been a lot of time to do both. We just celebrated the 20th anniversary of the release of our first album and we did a few shows, but I have had to sit out of some this year as well. It’s a tough balance, but I try to make it happen. Weekend gigs are mostly doable, but I can’t really be away from LA for weeks at a time. Although I have written a few cues on planes and in hotel rooms. MR: What advice do you have for new artists?JR: Write, write, write. Develop a voice. Be honest. Now I wouldn’t call that career advice, but it’s true. You want to sound like you. Also, patience. Don’t try to rush. I know things must happen fast when working, but getting there takes time. MR: What about advice to yourself when you were beginning you musical career?JR: The advice my bandmates and I always tried to follow was to never look sideways. It’s hard to stay true to that, but its always best to stay focused on what’s in front of you, not coming up from behind or right next to you. MR: What are you working on now? Having seen the new shows you’ve had to work on, any predictions about any of them?JR: I’m starting work on Legion, for FX. It’s always hard to predict anything about a show because you never know what people are going to think, but this show is so fantastic. I hope that people see it the same way I do. A Conversation with Us The DuoMike Ragogna: Hey Us The Duo, why not “We The Duo”? Ahem.Michael Alvarado: [laughs] Well, Us The Duo started as “Us,” straight up. We found that people were having a hard time Googling “Us” because of the United States. We were like a thousand fifty on the Google search engine, so we literally added “The Duo” as a way to search better, and it works. MR: You guys met on the set of a video, will you share that oh-so romantic story with all of us?MA: Definitely. I’m from North Carolina, Carissa’s from L.A. I had a college room mate who wanted to be an actor and live the dream, so he road tripped to L.A. and I went along to help him, just for the vacation. I saw on Twitter that a music video needed extras, so I showed up at this house and Carissa was there as an extra as well. It was definitely love at first sight for sure. For me, at least. It took her a little bit longer. We exchanged Twitter handles, since that’s kind of the new way of swapping numbers, and we kept in touch. When things started to get more serious, we moved to Facebook, and then when things got really serious, we moved to FaceTime. That is the social media steps of love, in case you’re wondering. MR: [laughs] Carissa. Do you concur!Carissa Alvarado: I do concur! I was playing hard-to-get in the beginning. I actually had a boyfriend at the time so I totally friend-zoned Michael. He really had to work to win me over, but it worked.MR: First of all, how did you get your initial Republic Records deal? It has something to do with a Vine video, right?MA: Exactly. After the love story happened, I moved to California and asked her to marry me, and she said yes. We got married and then Us The Duo formed. Right when we formed, we started making these little six-second covers in our living room. We had zero expectations, no intention of becoming internet famous or anything like that, but we did it, that happened, and we got like a million followers in thirty days. Then we got asked to go on Good Morning America and sing live, which we were very confused about. “Are you sure you want us, very normal people who just sit on the couch and watch Food Network all day to come on your show?” They were like, “Yes, please come!” So we did. We were nervous as heck. I think it was the most nervous thing we’ve ever done. After that, all these label inquiries came in through email. It was just a matter of picking, finding who was the best fit, and also figuring out how to transition our life from being very ordinary to being very fast-paced and on the forefront of people’s lives.MR: Your recording “No Matter Where You Are” was featured in Book Of Life. How did that come together?MA: We wrote the song as our wedding vows. We put the video of us singing it at our wedding online and it kind of went viral. You guys covered it―Huffington Post put it up; Business Insider and AOL put it on their home pages. All these things created this buzz and I think that’s what got it onto Fox’s radar. Somebody at the label did help make that connection a little stronger and get us a meeting inside, but really, Fox called us. Again, it was one of those situations where we’re sitting at home and we get a phone call from Fox that’s like, “Hey, we want to use your song in our movie, can you come to our office in the next hour?” “Yes, let me get dressed ASAP!” It was a very big surprise for us, that’s for sure.MR: Carissa, how did this snowballing success affect your relationship and the music’s creativity?CA: It all happened so fast, it was a little tougher, I have to admit. We had a rough patch in our relationship just because it got hard to balance out our career and our relationship at the same time. We’ve learned a lot and we’re at a good place now where we’re making sure that we do have time for date night. We make time for our relationship and we do remember that is the priority over everything else. Our career is very important and special to us, but we realize in those difficult times, personally and in our relationship, that we always need to remember that our relationship is the top priority no matter what.MR: And, of course, there’s the Oprah incident.MA: [laughs] Yeah, it was the craziest thing. We were playing that song live onstage, and Oprah’s kind of mysterious, she never really announces where she’s going to be or what’s going to happen, it’s just like, “Maybe she’ll show up! Be ready in case,” and that’s what happened. We were playing the song and she just walks onstage right between us and gives us this big bear hug and then we talk about the song a little bit to the crowd and it was one of those “pinch me” moments.MR: You kind of share an audience with Pentatonix. To me, that makes total sense because of the positive nature of your music and the positive nature of your personalities. The Pentatonix tour kind of broke Us The Duo even bigger, wasn’t it?CA: I would say so. They’ve got such wonderful fans that really do latch on to people they like, and like you said, since we’re so similar to them and we started in the same social media space as well. I think people see that and gravitate towards us. We’ve gotten a lot of their fans that are new fans of us coming to see our tour saying, “We saw you on the Pentatonix tour and we loved you so we wanted to support you.” It’s such a blessing that that all worked out and it’s even better that we’ve gotten even closer to the band because they’re such sweet people, they’ve got great hearts and they’re just so friggin’ talented. We are so inspired, watching them every night on their tour.MR: Did you learn anything about stagecraft or performance from them?CA: Oh, absolutely. Other than them being geniuses vocally, it showed us that we needed to practice and practice and practice as much as we can to get our voices up to the best of their ability. I think their performance and how they talk on stage really inspired us and we’re trying to put that into our performance more, talking to the audience and making them feel like they’re welcome, we’re just chilling in our living room and they’re all friends of ours. We’ve incorporated that into our performances as well.MR: I’m imagining you benefited from initially having a major label though now you’re releasing the new album, Just Love, differently. It’s very hard to say goodbye to a major label, and this was your decision, not theirs. How has that affected your career since the parting?MA: Imagine two people who have always dreamed of being musicians since they were little kids. For them, a record deal is like the cream of the crop. That’s it, you’ve made it. We always had our eyes on that, and until we got that we thought we weren’t successful, so that’s exactly what we did, and we signed the deal. At the time, they were the number one label in the US, so it seemed to make sense. We went through the motions and the formulas and we realized it wasn’t everything we thought it was. It’s not just our label in particular, I think it’s labels in general. Basically, we had the harsh reality that a label is a bank. You sign with them in order to get their investment on you, and they use their team of people to decide what’s best for your career and there comes a point where you just have to say, “Okay, whatever you say,” because they’re paying for it. Over time, as entrepreneurs like Criss and I are, who came through the social media space and have ten million followers that we garnished ourselves, it’s hard to be forced to listen to opinions above you over and over and over. What happened was we got creatively dry. We were on a label with Drake and Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift, so it’s like, “We’re not going to get priority or the same funding or the same say,” so we kind of just had to surrender ourselves to whatever the machine told us to do, so we hit that wall. “Okay, we have ten million followers who believe in us, but we’re not able to do exactly what we want to do, so why don’t we just try going out on our own?” That is a very scary decision, especially for Carissa and I and our manager because we didn’t necessarily realize how much the label does in the background, like the logistical things, setting up your merch store and shipping around the world, distribution and royalty points and all of these things now fall on us, but it was a risk we were willing to take in order to put out the music we wanted and own those rights. That’s kind of where it came from. We left in December of last year; it was a very smooth parting, there’s no bad blood or anything. The next week, we flew to Nashville, booked a studio and a couple players that we knew, and we all just sat in a room. We stared each other in the face and tracked these songs that Criss and I wrote and pressed record. It was the most creative sparking inspirational thing that we’d ever experienced and we needed that for our souls as musicians. We were just starving for it. This album, Just Love, was a creative burst of whatever needed to come out or else we would’ve exploded. The timing of it couldn’t have been better.CA: Yeah, mainly just the creative freedom at that point, putting out music that we wanted to put out from the heart and was very personal to us. I really think that the fans noticed the change and the shift in our music and what we were putting out when we did sign to the label. So I think when we started putting our own stuff out again, fans will really love and know and understand that that is us and who we are.MR: One of the coolest things you ever did was the “2015 Top Hits In 3.5 Minutes.” Which are your favorite segments from that medley?MA: That medley is one of the most painstaking things we’ve put together. This is our second one and each one has luckily gone viral, but we spend like two weeks picking the right songs, figuring out the right key―I think that medley is in five different keys―trying to showcase Criss’ voice, making sure I can beat box and play piano. I think my favorite segment is when everything drops, the beat box comes in for the first time, the piano’s hitting hard and Criss is wailing this high note, I think it’s right when we hit the One Direction section. We’ve been doing this live on the Pentatonix run as the last song and everybody goes crazy right after the ending because we do this jazz/blues walk down. It’s added a few standing ovations. We’re like, “Are you sure? We’re just two people on stage.” It’s a powerful thing when you look up and see ten thousand people standing in front of you for a pop medley. It’s really cool.MR: Do you still have some perks you got from Republic? For instance, do you have the same touring manager, or did that change when you left?MA: When we left, we didn’t have to use any of their in-house people. One of the downside of a label is they have an office with a section for each thing―marketing, publicity, whatever―and you’re stuck with that. It’s free, of course you’re going to take it. But when we left, we pretty much hired individual superstars on each platform. We scouted and had meetings and said, “Why would you make a great publicist for us?” “What about you as a booking agency? What’s going to make you fit with a social media band? How are you going to understand our audience and get us the best shows?” So we did that for maybe a month after we left. At this point, we’ve built almost a completely new team minus our original manager who is my college buddy who’s been there since the beginning. We kept him, but everybody else at this point is pretty much brand new.MR: And you acquired Jim Flammia who also handles Darlingside, so as soon as he pitched you to me, I said, “I’m in.”CA: Yay!MA: That was one of those things where he took a chance on us, because we know he normally doesn’t work in our genre, but we could tell by just a couple of conversations on the phone that he believed in us and understood what we were going for, so it was a good fit.MR: Once you enter a mix like that, if you don’t get superstardom, at the very least, you get fulfillment.MA: Totally.MR: So Us The Duo. What advice do you have for new artists?CA: We love answering this question. We would say a few things: Staying consistent, like what we do with our Vines. We found something that wasn’t being done, we found a niche, something special, and we stayed consistent with it. We did it every single day, no matter how much we didn’t want to film a vine, we filmed a vine. We switched out our shirts to make it look like we had a humungous closet; we kept doing that and in thirty days, we got a million followers. We were on to something, so we just knew that consistency was key and we kept that up. Another big thing is social media. That’s an obvious answer because it’s such a huge and important tool. We use it and we will never stop using it because that’s what we are, we’re “social media stars,” so we have to keep that going. That’s such an important tool that I think any artist should use and benefit from to get seen around the world. Now we have fans from different countries begging us to come play a show wherever they are. It’s just amazing, the power that social media has. Michael, do you have anything to add to that?MA: Hmm. I’d say don’t be afraid to be bold in what your specific talent is. At a lot of our VIP meet-and-greets when we do these shows, a young girl or a young guy carries in a guitar and asks us to sign it and says, “What advice do you have for me as I try to be a musician?” We always say that one thing: You have to figure out what you do best. Maybe other people do it but be confident that you’re the best at it and just own it. Criss and I were so scared of the social media label at first. We were like, “Oh man, people are calling us ‘Those singers from Facebook’ or ‘That couple from Snapchat.’ We want to be ‘That couple from the Billboard charts,’” but then we began to own it. You know what? They’re still stopping us and recognizing us, that is such a cool thing. Now we’re like, “Yeah, we’re that couple from Facebook, thanks for saying hey!” The last thing I think would be constantly practice. For Criss and I, that’s always setting up the iPhone, pressing “record,” staring at it, playing to it and then watching it back. There’s something so powerful and meticulous in watching your videos back.MR: There’s really good value in that, and I don’t know if everybody does that. I think some artists don’t like to look at themselves, but you guys were blessed with photogenia.MA: Aww.CA: [laughs]MR: But I want to ask you, Us The Michael, how much money would it take for you to cut off your man-bun? There has to be a number. Come on.CA: [laughs] No!MA: I think that answers the question. I would probably not even have it, but the wifey wants me to keep it around.CA: I love it!MA: Happy wife, happy life. I’m a man-bunner.MR: Have you ever talked about doing a joint venture with Pentatonix, maybe a record?MA: Ooh.CA: We haven’t really talked about it but we would absolutely be open to it.MA: We sing a song with them on their tour, all seven of us stand in a horseshoe and sing a full song, which is so nice of them to even bring us up on their set and even do that. But I don’t see why there’s no reason we shouldn’t hop in the studio with them. That’s a great idea.MR: Thank you. My spider senses are telling me they’ll respond positively.MA: I think so. You might be onto something. We’ll have to give you some credit if it happens.MR: Ha! Oh, you know how it starts? Get together with them to write a few songs.MA: There you go. I like that.MR: What’s the future of the duo?MA: The last two and a half years have been hodgepodge because we’ve been going where everybody wanted us to go. So now we left the label, we hopped on tour―a hundred and fifty days of touring this year, it’s been total madness, so we haven’t even had a chance to think about it yet. Everything restarts when we get back from PTX Fall tour, right around Thanksgiving. MR: ...don’t forget the songwriting and recording!MA: [laughs] We’re going to go on vacation for like a week and be a couple again, and then we’re going to start back where we came from, spending a few months just honing our social media accounts again. We’re going to make videos, cover videos, new arrangements, we’re going to write again and just kind of go back to the basis of it all. Then we’ll hit Europe on a tour as Us The Duo, we’re going to go to Asia, which they don’t know yet and I’m super excited about because Criss is Filipina, so every time we show up in the Philippines it’s like the queen has come home, it’s the craziest thing. That’s kind of the broad plan, bringing back the social media, doing more of a European and Asian tour and figuring it out from there.MR: Us The Carissa, what did he leave out?MA: [laughs]CA: See that’s good, you knew. Eventually, obviously, a family. I think that is starting to come across our minds as we’ve been married for four years now, going on five. That’s definitely in the future, I don’t know how soon or how far away. That’s what he left out of course.MR: Then you’d better get on that PTX collaboration really quickly.MA: That’s child support right there.MR: [laughs] I’m all out of questions. Miss Carissa, could you ask Us The Michael a question?CA: Oh this is fun! If you could vacation anywhere in the world right now, where would it be, Michael?MA: I would go to the British Virgin Islands and get a hut on the beach and do absolutely nothing but sit there with a guitar and a beer and you.MR: And your man-bun.CA: And your man-bun!MA: It might be a little sandy, but it’ll still be there.MR: And Michael, what would you ask Us The Carissa?MA: Oh! If you had to quit Us The Duo tonight...MR: [gasps!]MA: What would do tomorrow? Anything in the world goes, but Us The Duo doesn’t exist.CA: I would take on fashion and get into modeling and acting.MA: So you don’t even need me.CA: Yeah. [laughs]MR: See, I thought the word “convent” was going to come into the mix, but I guess not.CA: [laughs]MR: Almost forgot to ask, what is your favorite song on the new album and why?CA: I would say my favorite song would have to be “Safe,” just because it’s something we’ve never done before, recording-wise. We did it completely live in the studio, one take, and that is exactly how it sounds on the album. We didn’t tune anything, we didn’t add anything. It was just a very raw and real moment, and also the fact that it’s such a relatable song right now in this crazy world that we live in. Whenever we perform it onstage, I get pretty emotional. That one’s my favorite. I just think it’s such a beautiful, beautiful song.MA: For me, I’m going to go with “Stop (Just Love)” for three reasons: Number one, I get to use really jazzy chords in there, and I feel kind of rebellious as a pop artist because it’s all those things I would show to the label and they’d go, “I don’t know, it’s a little too jazzy for pop,” so I was just like, “Whatever, we don’t have any rules; jazz chords.” Number two, we changed the key completely between the chorus and the verse, which is something I’ve always wanted to do just as an arranger. Number three: It’s a good song at showcasing Carissa and I individually as well as together. She sings the first verse and kind of does the sassy, cool thing, and then I get to try something in the second verse and then we come together in the chorus and harmonize. I think it’s just a cool overall song that says, “Hey, we’re Us The Duo, we’re independent, we’re at it again, check it out.”Transcribed by Galen HawthorneA Conversation with Sarah SimmonsMike Ragogna: Sarah, you’ve been pretty busy after participating in The Voice. Before we talk about your new album, please would you catch us up on what you’ve been doing?Sarah Simmons: Within a week after The Voice, film producer Marty Bowen contacted me, and invested in my album. Marty sent me to Nashville, TN, where I recorded with Marshall Altman at House of Blues, Studio A. Then I moved to LA where I began recording music for TV and film. I have put together a band and have been touring for the last year. We are currently touring for my album, Freedom, which has currently landed us in New York for my CD release. We will be on tour until fall 2017.MR: The title of your new album is Freedom. Are you feeling free these days? From the artist’s perspective, how does that title apply to this group of songs?SS: Actually, yes, currently touring all around the country seeing the world, and meeting beautiful people. When I wrote this album I didn’t know how much of an effect the songs would have on me. Every time I sing the words I get a new perspective. The overall expression of what I want my music to stand for―I want people to listen and walk away free. I think it is so important to release yourself of people, places and things that are hindering you from your potential, happiness and well-being. This album is a depiction of my personal journey overcoming burdens holding me from personal freedom.MR: How did Freedom come together and please can you take us on a tour of the album’s material?SS: Each song reflects a time in my life. They are a consensus of my growth and personal experiences of different situations, and also just the realities of life. I have always loved every single genre of music, and I think you will hear that on my album. The music is a mixture of the music I grew up listening to mixed with my own adaptation and my own style.MR: What was the studio experience like and which songs became dearer to you or upgraded significantly as they were being recorded? SS: I will never forget my experience recording my first album. Marshall truly pushed me to great heights. It was emotionally challenging, but freeing at the same time. When I was behind the glass listening to the musicians recording my music, I realized my dreams were becoming a reality. “Staring At The Sun,” was the song that truly brought me to my knees. The song is a depiction of loss and how we deal with it. It was written in memory of my close friend, Sean Reeder. Going to the studio and recording it absolutely blew my mind. That was freeing. Even after two years of his passing it had felt like a day still hadn’t passed.MR: How did being in theater at an early age affect your taste in music and which artists influenced you as you grew up? SS: Being in theater at an early age gave me an understanding of the overall production of a genuine performance. I absolutely love musical theater and actually love the acting part just as much as the singing. It also gave me an appreciation for all styles of music. Between my Grandmother’s oldies influence, and my Dad’s love for rock ‘n’ roll, coupled with the musical theater music I grasped a diverse appreciation for all music and performance arts. The artists that truly inspired me are: Etta James, Billie Holiday, Rosemary Clooney, Led Zeppelin, Elvis Presley, Stevie Nix, Eddie Vedder, and Lisa Gerrard just to name a few.MR: Rumor has it you got a guitar at 15 and started writing songs. Any truth to that rumor and if so, can you remember what inspired see of those songs?SS: Rumor is true! I always wanted another instrument to accompany myself. Dad gave me my first guitar at 15 years old. My Dad had really inspired someone in recovery. This person was so moved by father’s ability to play; so much that he passed his guitar down to my Dad upon leaving rehab. This came to be my first guitar. With so much going on in my life at a young age, there was always inspiration to draw from.MR: What advice do you have for new artists?SS: If you are serious about it you can never give up. This business is for the people who never give up. It is for people who sacrifice their time and energy to do what you ultimately love. Sometimes the pay off is far in the horizon, but the risk is worth the reward. At times it may seem like you’re far away from success but your closer than you think. Remember it’s about the journey not the destination. MR: Can you remind us about your wild audition for The Voice?SS: It was an incredible experience. I had never expected to have all the judges turn around, that was beyond my comprehension. I couldn’t believe that four judges were facing me. What was funny is that I was actually really calm and not nervous at all. It could’ve been the chamomile tea that I drank before I went on stage or just the prayer I said before walking out. I will never forget that.MR: Sarah, I think you were robbed! What’s your theory on why you and Judith Hill were eliminated on The Voice when everyone went nuts about you both?SS: Thank you so much for the compliment. I truly believe it was absolutely perfect the time that I left. You don’t have to win the show to have a successful career. The show is honestly an experience, not your career. I believe that I probably wouldn’t have been able to release an album of my own personal music this soon had I gone further. I am so grateful for the experience with the show, the amazing friends that I made for a lifetime, and the stepping-stones that the show afforded me.MR: In a perfect world, what does Sarah Simmons’ future look like? And do you have any goals beyond music that you need to get to?SS: I can’t say for sure, but my ultimate goal is to move people with my music. It seems my future is a reflection of what I’m doing now. People have expressed to me that my music has helped them, and push them through barriers to make a change. This is my goal, to expand the quantity and number of people I can reach through song. A Conversation with Bob HolzMike Ragogna: Bob, the title of your new album, A Vision Forward, suggests this project is a commitment to change or progress. Was that the mission?Bob Holz: I looked around myself at what most people like musically and how they perceive popular music. I decided that the title would reflect a desire to create fresh and forward thinking musical ideas. The mission was to produce music that respects the tradition of jazz and at the same time attempts to break new ground.MR: The musicians that appear on A Vision Forward include Randy Brecker, Mike Stern, and Larry Coryell. How did you decide which guests to include and what was the recording process with which you captured their performances?BH: Since the compositions owe a lot to the fusion movement of the 1970’s, what better way to bring them to life than to have some of the key participants involved? The process was natural since I grew up around that musical period. I selected the players based on their ability to make a tune outstanding and used traditional recording techniques.MR: What did each guest bring to the project?BH: They brought their respective wealth of knowledge coupled with a willingness to try something new. For example, Mike Stern used his signature sound on the tune “Moving Eyes” to create a unique flow both rhythmically and harmonically.MR: How do you keep an objectivity when you produce your own recordings? BH: I try to identify the strong points, both compositionally and performance wise and then I allow the process to nurture both. That process includes the sound engineering aspect. I also know when to take a break and come back with a refreshed perspective. MR: How do you currently write songs? How collaborative are you with others when it comes to composing? How much improvisation goes into that part of the creative process?BH: I write at the piano. Once I have a draft chart, I meet with another piano player who helps me fine tune. When writing, I immediately have an idea in my mind as to how the melody should fit with the changes. As I craft and fine tune the composition begins to take shape. It’s more of crafting an initial idea verses improvisation. I leave plenty of room in the tunes for the players to improvise.MR: What influences from the past did you take into this step forward? Are there any artists, even beyond jazz, that will always influence your creative outlook?BH: My early exposure to jazz included listening to Sun Ra and Charles Mingus. I have also been profoundly influenced by many of the 1960’s rock and folk artists.MR: Which recordings on A Vision Forward do you feel represent some sort of breakthrough or leap in creativity for you?BH: To me, Steve Weingart’s synthesizer and electric piano part in “The Stand Up” exemplifies a creative leap forward in jazz improvisation.MR: Was there anything unusual that you applied to the recording process, maybe some new effects or new approach to recording your music?BH: For the mastering process we used a new state of the art platform which created unique cymbal textures and helped me to get a more individualized sound.MR: What is jazz to you these days, the current state of it and where you think it might be heading?BH: I think there is a wealth of great jazz coming out. I’m pleased to see many young players embracing jazz and fusing it with other musical styles. I have an optimistic view of the future of jazz and fusion.MR: Speaking of the future, are there any young artists out there who you admire, maybe enough to want to help with their careers?BH: I admire pianist Joey Alexander. The idea of producing recordings for up and coming artists is something I’ve been very interested in. I expect to follow that interest in the future.MR: What advice do you have for new artists?BH: I suggest one researches the great musical artists of the past. Listening to many different types of music can build a knowledge base. On stage, always listen. Keep your ears tuned to what’s going on at all times. If you listen and play musically with good feel, you’ll build a positive reputation in the business.MR: You know what include another vision forward for you? Dropping drums and switching to saxophone. Tempting, right?BH: As I mentioned, I’m very interested in producing projects for up and coming artists. As for branching out and playing other instruments, look for Bob Holz to record some vibes in the future.MR: As an established jazz artist, from your perspective, where is your place currently in the field and where is it heading?BH: I’m a creative artist first and I don’t want to stick to any formulas in my compositions. That being said, my place is to maintain a good work ethic regarding the composition and performance of my music. I want to create music that touches the listener on an emotional level. My hope is that my music will evolve and change for the better. A Conversation with Matt RossMike Ragogna: You have a new venture, One River School of Art + Design. What gave you the idea and how did it come together? Matt Ross: Let’s face it. Art education is broken in America and has been so for many years. One River dissected what was wrong with art education and developed a new approach that has made learning art fun and cool. And along the way we developed a plan to “transform art education in America”. Ragogna: What made you franchise One River School of Art + Design as opposed to outright owning and expanding?Ross: We are actually doing both. Our goal is to find the right operators across America and also identify select markets for company-owned units. It’s a big country and we want to bring our service everywhere. What better way to grow than partnering with franchisees in their home towns? We are looking for people who have a passion for the visual arts but also have the skill set to build and lead a great business.Ragogna: What kinds of courses does the school offer and what kind of faculty are you involving, and what are the teaching methods and classes?Ross: Over the last five years we have refined our proprietary methods called “Art Shuffle” and “Art Focus” into “a new direction in art education.” Our courses are designed for people of all ages and delivered in a state of the art facility that feels like you are in Soho.Ragogna: What should a student expect to have learned after “graduating” from One River School of Art + Design? Ross: How to appreciate making and consuming art. They should have the ability to determine what is well done, what is relevant and what is potentially important. They will also likely continue making art for the rest of their lives because we provide a fun experience first that fosters the enjoyment of making art. They will take this with them.Ragogna: Does One River offer any artistic subjects or approaches that are unique to the school or perhaps are better than our traditional school system?Ross: Another innovative aspect is the school’s focus on Contemporary Art. One River has patterned its lesson plans on the last 50 years of art making and is tapping into a growing interest in the work of living artists as subject matter for its curricula. This provides for a fresh approach and produces vibrant artistic outcomes that are in line with today’s art world. We also have pioneered some innovative courses in digital arts and using the latest technology in our classroom that is largely reserved for university level work.Ragogna: What is your own history with art and while we’re at it, music?Ross: I am not a visual artist but I create everyday. When I was young, I was in the performing arts and like a lot of kids I stopped when I didn’t find a local space to nurture that interest. I learned to play music and have written and recorded. I have also developed a couple of screenplays and dabble in photography and video. At the end of the day, my creative energy gets applied to business and branding and that has provided some great rewards for me.I also spent 20 years in radio working for and running some of the most important radio brands in the country, including Q104.3 and Hot 97 in New York.Ragogna: Matt, you were also an early employee of School of Rock. What was the origin of the School of Rock and what was your role?Ross: I was hired in 2005 and ran the company until mid 2010. We went through a dynamic growth period and I am proud of the work I did there and remain a partner in the business today. Paul Green was the Founder and created the concept and many people believe he was the inspiration for the Jack Black character. Just so we are clear, One River is not owned or endorsed by School of Rock.Ragogna: Both art and music always seem to be the first cuts made when there are budget concerns. Since it’s been proven that a child’s healthy development needs to include art and music in the very least for hemispheric balance in the brain, why don’t we acknowledge this? Is this in the same category as climate change denying?Ross: LOL…I love it. I just read an insanely powerful article in the New York Times about climate change. My guess is the denial is not that bad…climate change will destroy the Earth. Not having art and music will destroy the soul...but you can still be alive and spend your time watching sports on 75 sports channels.Ragogna: What advice do you have for visual artists?Ross: Make a lot of work. Have fun. Don’t try to be too serious. Get to know as many other artists as possible. Continue to educate yourself. And most of all, it is not a straight line to economic success but it may be your purpose in life so be sure to give it your all. We need artists to keep our world in balance."

This time they",2016-08-26,"Huma Abedin, aide to Hillary Clinton, was accused of having ties to extremism.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bfff311600002b00bfe96e.jpg?cache=8lNfmdBYTS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this week, news headlines began popping up regarding Hillary Clinton’s top campaign aide Huma Abedin. This time they weren’t about her marriage to former representative Anthony Weiner (D-NY) who resigned after a Twitter sexting scandal. The headlines were concerning whether Abedin had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and “worked at a radical Muslim journal for dozens of years.” While sources fact-checked these statements and determined their falsity, politicians who support Donald Trump have used this “extremist connection” rhetoric against Abedin. Sean Duffy (R-WI) during a CNN interview on Thursday insisted that Human Abedin had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Trump supporters have used these statements as a way to undermine Clinton’s campaign by slandering one of her top advisors. Similarly, when London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan was running for office, his opponent Zac Goldsmith accused Khan of having ties with extremists in Britain. While this did not cost Khan the election, it did tap into anti-Muslim feelings amongst voters and further exacerbated Islamophobic opinionsThis growing practice of politicians accusing Muslim political figures of having links to extremist groups begs the question: What are the consequences of falsely accusing our top Muslims in politics of having connections to extremist organizations?Rhetoric claiming a Muslim’s link to extremism exacerbates Islamophobia. Whether it’s in news headlines or coming directly from politicians, discussions of a Muslim political figures’ connection to extremists—true or not—has an impact on how the public views Muslims. And given the heightened tensions in the West regarding terrorist attacks from the Islamic State on their soil, the public is eager to believe another reason why they cannot trust Muslims, especially those that are involved in politics. With Muslims in politics facing defamation, there is a clear disincentive for more Muslims to seek opportunities in government. Muslims are severely underrepresented in political positions in the Western world. Currently, in Congress Muslims account for 0.4% of total members. And with Islamophobia already relatively high, it is an uphill battle for a Muslim to hold a prominent political position without controversy. These instances of alleging that a Muslim in politics has connections to extremists makes it more difficult for Muslims to be successful in government; therefore, discouraging more Muslim representation.In order to build trust and cooperation between the Muslim community and the government, we need to stop alienating Muslims by slandering politicians and government officials who represent them. Muslim communities need both allies and individuals of their faith to advocate for them in government. Yet, when these individuals are labeled as extremist sympathizers they lose their ability to represent and work for Muslims communities. Recently, more efforts have been made to positively showcase Muslims in government. In February, the White House featured stories of Muslim public servants highlighting that despite their experiences with discrimination they are dedicated to working for the American people. Although this is a step in the right direction, it does not counter the mudslinging against Muslims running for public office or those who work for politicians running for office.If the West expects to tackle Islamophobia it cannot do so without having Muslims in public office and top government roles. But the West also cannot expect to see Muslims in these roles if they regularly face smearing from opponents that claim they are linked to extremist groups. Sadiq Khan may have still won London’s mayoral election; however, there is little hope for the success of Muslims, such as Huma Abedin, in politics if we continue down this path of false accusations and ridiculous conspiracies.Follow Feyaad Allie on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/feyaadallie"

He’s a great guy who has done incredible work with charities,” McDowell said. “I’m confident that Pine Bros. fans will support our decision to give Ryan a second chance.”“Love your brothers,” text on the company website reads ― somewhat appropriately, given Lochte’s status as a consummate “bro.” “They’ll love you back.” This story has been updated with comments from Pine Bros and Lochte."
