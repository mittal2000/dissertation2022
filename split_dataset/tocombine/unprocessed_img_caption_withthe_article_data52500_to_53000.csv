Because of the visit, and, well, because it's election season, there has been a lot of attention on Trump with much talk about the presidential hopeful on the news. I would normally be excited about a local visit from a presidential candidate. I would talk to my children about it and use such a visit as an opportunity to teach my children about the presidential campaign, important elections, and the democratic process. But I found myself ""laying low"" about this visit. One morning my oldest son and I were in the kitchen making breakfast, tea and conversation. My oldest son is in college, and since this is his first national election in which he will be able to vote, he's been talking a lot of politics this election season. We were discussing Donald Trump and some of the offensive things he's said, specifically about women and minorities. I told my son about a friend who wanted some ""exact quotes"" that were evidence of Trump's sexist and racist language. So my son and I opened my laptop to find some of those quotes. Right was I was reading one that I find most offensive as a woman, the one where he referred to women as a ""piece of ass"" in an old Esquire interview, my husband and youngest son, who is only six years old, walked into the room. I didn't know they were there, but they were just in time to hear me reading Trump's quote. My husband told me to ""watch my language,"" that our youngest was in the room. This was an epiphanic moment for me. We were quoting a man who could be our future president, and I couldn't let my little boy hear what he had said. Of course, some could argue that was an older quote, and it was, but Trump's rhetoric related to women and minorities is often offensive and inappropriate, as he refers to women as bimbos or implies they are successful in their careers because of their sex appeal. Although I missed many of the Republican nominee debates on television, I was very much aware of Trump's rhetoric from reports on the news and social media. Despite being concerned by much of Trump's rhetoric throughout the debate process, when took to social media to defend the size of his private parts after one of the debates, I was concerned that the rhetoric was reaching a new low, and I was concerned about the message this was sending my children. These Tweets were shared all over the world. And those Tweets worry me. Trump seems fast and loose with his comments on Twitter, and these things, obviously, make the news. When he wrote that Hillary Clinton couldn't ""satisfy"" her husband, so how could she ""satisfy"" American, it was definitely another cringe-worthy moment for me. What kind of example does this set for our children?Whether we want to or not, we need to stop and think about how the President of the United States is a role model for our children. That person has reached the highest office and is seen as the pinnacle of success in our culture, and children look up to our presidents. I don't know how to even begin to talk about a president like Donald Trump with my six year old. My husband and I are trying to raise a son who respects women, who understands that all people are different, unique, special, and deserve respect. We're trying to teach our son that we can't group all minorities together and that to do so is a form of racism. We're also trying to raise him with kindness and love and with an understanding that words are powerful and can hurt. We try to teach our son that words can actually hurt most of all. We can say we're sorry when we say mean things, but the damage is done. We need to be thoughtful in how we speak to and about people. Donald Trump doesn't seem to believe in these lessons and seems to be careless with his language choices, or, perhaps, he is purposeful, but that concerns me even more. I'm concerned that he's setting a bad example for our children about how our democracy works and how the words we say reflect who we are as people. I wonder if Trump's supporters have stopped to think about this: Would you want your children to hear the things Trump says? Would you be okay if your children spoke to and about people in the same way?I don't think Trump is going to change unless his supporters demand it of him. He said during the Republican debates that he could ""shoot someone"" and would not lose his voters. I would love to prove him wrong. This kind of arrogance and recklessness with his language really does set a bad example for our children. I think we need to demand better behavior of a presidential candidate. Author's note: This piece ran originally this week in the Bangor Daily News on the same day Trump visited my home state. I was surprised at the backlash against the post from those who assumed this was a pro-Hillary Clinton piece. This is not.This piece is simply about a man, who could be our future president, using powerful language to send messages of anger, resentment, and discrimination in public ways, in ways that reach our children. I think it's no accident that my message was misconstrued. When someone doesn't like the truth, the easiest thing to do is to change the subject."
1,POLITICS,"Patriotic Progressives Embrace the Flag, Too","Peter Dreier and Dick Flacks, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/post_12483_b_10783372.html,July 4 is an occasion for Americans to express their patriotism.

Activists display the flag at a march for immigrant rights.  July 4 is an occasion for Americans to express their patriotism. But the ways we do so are as diverse as our nation. To some, patriotism means ""my country -- right or wrong."" To others, it means loyalty to a set of principles, and thus requires dissent and criticism when those in power violate those standards. One version of patriotism suggests ""Love it or leave it."" The other version means ""Love it and fix it."" Former President George W. Bush questioned the patriotism of anyone who challenged his war on terrorism. In his 2001 State of the Union address, for example, Bush claimed, ""You're either with us, or with the terrorists."" He introduced the Patriot Act to codify this view, giving the government new powers to suppress dissent. (The anti-war movement countered with bumper stickers illustrated with an American flag that proclaimed ""Peace is Patriotic."")In contrast, President Barack Obama has said: ""I have no doubt that, in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it."" He observed that, ""Loving your country shouldn't just mean watching fireworks on the Fourth of July. Loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it. If you do, your life will be richer, our country will be stronger."" He was echoing the words of Rev. Martin Luther King, who declared, in a speech during the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955, ""the great glory of American democracy is the right to protest for right.""After his followers began chanting ""build that wall"" at a rally last month in Tampa, Donald Trump interrupted his speech and gave a bear hug to an American flag behind him on the stage -- apparently as a way to demonstrate his patriotism.Displaying the flag -- on one's house, business, or car, even on coffee mugs, clothing, and tattoos -- is a traditional way for people to voice their love of country. Jodi Goglio, chief operating officer at Eder Flag Manufacturing Co. in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, reports that the firm is having a banner year. Sales are up 15% from a year ago, in part because this is a national election year and political events need flags.Ironically, about 6% of all American flags sold in the U.S. are made in China. Surely Trump, who wants to ""make America great again"" and ""bring jobs home"" would support legislation requiring that all American flags be manufactured in this country. But that would conflict with Trump's own business practices. The entire Donald J. Trump Collection of clothing -- including men's dress shirts, suits, ties and accessories -- is made in factories overseas, mostly in China, Bangladesh, and Central America, to take advantage of cheap labor. What kind of patriotism is that?Trump follows in the tradition of Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, America's largest corporation, who promoted the motto ""Buy American."" But today the retail giant, now owned by his heirs, imports most of its merchandise from Asia, much of it made under inhumane sweatshop conditionsProgressives understand that people can disagree with their government and still love their country and its ideals. The flag, as a symbol of the nation, is not owned by the administration in power, but by the people. We battle over what it means, but all Americans -- across the political spectrum -- have an equal right to claim the flag as their own.Indeed, throughout U.S. history, many American radicals and progressive reformers have proudly asserted their patriotism. To them, America stood for basic democratic values -- economic and social equality, mass participation in politics, free speech and civil liberties, elimination of the second-class citizenship of women and racial minorities, a welcome mat for the world's oppressed people. The reality of corporate power, right-wing xenophobia, and social injustice only fueled progressives' allegiance to these principles and the struggle to achieve them.Most Americans are unaware that much of our patriotic culture -- including many of the leading symbols and songs -- was created by people with decidedly progressive sympathies.For example, the Pledge of Allegiance was authored and promoted by Rev. Francis Bellamy, a leading Christian socialist. Bellamy penned the Pledge of Allegiance in 1892 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' discovery of America by promoting use of the flag in public schools.It was the Gilded Age, an era of major political and social conflict. Reformers were outraged by the widening gap between rich and poor, and the behavior of corporate robber barons who were exploiting workers, gouging consumers, and corrupting politics with their money. Workers were organizing unions. Farmers joined forces in the Populist movement to leash the power of banks, railroads, and utility companies. Progressive reformers fought for child labor laws, against slum housing, and in favor of women's suffrage. Radicals were gaining new converts.In foreign affairs, Americans were battling over the nation's role in the world. America was beginning to act like an imperial power, justifying its expansion with a combination of white supremacy, manifest destiny, and spreading democracy. At the time, nativist groups in the North and Midwest as well as the South were pushing for restrictions on immigrants -- Catholics, Jews, and Asians -- deemed to be polluting Protestant America. In the South, the outcome of the Civil War still inflamed regional passions. Many Southerners, including Civil War veterans, swore allegiance to the Confederate flag.Bellamy (cousin of best-selling radical writer Edward Bellamy) believed that unbridled capitalism, materialism, and individualism betrayed America's promise. He hoped the Pledge of Allegiance would promote a different moral vision to counter the rampant greed he thought was undermining the nation. Bellamy initially intended to use the phrase ""liberty, fraternity and equality,"" but concluded that the radical rhetoric of the French Revolution wouldn't sit well with many Americans. So he coined the phrase, ""one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all,"" intending it to express a more egalitarian vision of America, a secular patriotism to help unite a divided nation.Or consider the lines inscribed on the Statue of Liberty: ""Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" Emma Lazarus was a poet of considerable reputation in her day, who was a strong supporter of Henry George and his ""socialistic"" single-tax program, and a friend of William Morris, a leading British socialist. Her welcome to the ""wretched refuse"" of the earth, written in 1883, was an effort to project an inclusive and egalitarian definition of the American Dream.And there was Katharine Lee Bates, a professor of English at Wellesley College. Bates was an accomplished and published poet, whose book America the Beautiful and Other Poems includes a sequence of poems expressing outrage at U.S. imperialism in the Philippines. A member of progressive-reform circles in the Boston area, concerned about labor rights, urban slums and women's suffrage, an ardent feminist, for decades she lived with and loved her Wellesley colleague Katharine Coman, an economist and social activist.""America the Beautiful,"" written in 1893, not only speaks to the beauty of the American continent but also reflects her view that U.S. imperialism undermines the nation's core values of freedom and liberty. The poem's final words -- ""and crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea"" -- are an appeal for social justice rather than the pursuit of wealth.In the Depression years and during World War II, the fusion of populist, egalitarian and anti-racist values with patriotic expression reached full flower.Langston Hughes' poem, ""Let America Be America Again,"" written in 1936, contrasted the nation's promise with its mistreatment of his fellow African-Americans, the poor, Native Americans, workers, farmers and immigrants:O, let my land be a land where Liberty Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath But opportunity is real, and life is free Equality is in the air we breathe. In 1939, composer Earl Robinson teamed with lyricist John La Touche to write ""Ballad for Americans,"" which was performed on the CBS radio network by Paul Robeson, accompanied by chorus and orchestra. This 11-minute cantata provided a musical review of American history, depicted as a struggle between the ""nobody who's everybody"" and an elite that fails to understand the real, democratic essence of America.Robeson, at the time one of the best-known performers on the world stage, became, through this work, a voice of America. Broadcasts and recordings of ""Ballad for Americans"" (by Bing Crosby as well as Robeson) were immensely popular. In the summer of 1940, it was performed at the national conventions of both the Republican and Communist parties. The work soon became a staple in school choral performances, but it was literally ripped out of many public school songbooks after Robinson and Robeson were identified with the radical left and blacklisted during the McCarthy period. Since then, however, ""Ballad for Americans"" has been periodically revived, notably during the bicentennial celebration in 1976, when a number of pop and country singers performed it in concerts and on TV.Aaron Copland's ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" and ""A Lincoln Portrait,"" both written in 1942, are now patriotic musical standards, regularly performed at major civic events. Few Americans know that Copland was a member of a radical composers' group.Many Americans consider Woody Guthrie's song ""This Land Is Your Land,"" penned in 1940, to be our unofficial national anthem. Guthrie, a radical, was inspired to write the song as an answer to Irving Berlin's popular ""God Bless America,"" which he thought failed to recognize that it was the ""people"" to whom America belonged.The words to ""This Land Is Your Land"" reflect Guthrie's assumption that patriotism and support for the underdog were interconnected. In this song, Guthrie celebrated America's natural beauty and bounty, but criticized the country for its failure to share its riches. This is reflected in the song's last and least-known verse, which Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen included when they performed the song in January 2009 at a pre-inaugural concert in front of the Lincoln Memorial, with President-elect Obama in the audience:One bright sunny morning; In the shadow of the steeple; By the relief office; I saw my people. As they stood hungry; I stood there wondering; If this land was made for you and me. During the 1960s, American progressives continued to seek ways to fuse their love of country with their opposition to the government's policies. The March on Washington in 1963 gathered at the Lincoln Memorial, where Martin Luther King Jr. famously quoted the words to ""My Country 'Tis of Thee,"" repeating the phrase ""Let freedom ring"" 11 times.Phil Ochs, then part of a new generation of politically conscious singer-songwriters who emerged during the 1960s, wrote an anthem in the Guthrie vein, ""The Power and the Glory,"" that coupled love of country with a strong plea for justice and equality. The words to the chorus echo the sentiments of the anti-Vietnam War movement:Here is a land full of power and glory; Beauty that words cannot recall; Oh her power shall rest on the strength of her freedom; Her glory shall rest on us all. One of its stanzas updated Guthrie's combination of outrage and patriotism:Yet she's only as rich as the poorest of her poor; Only as free as the padlocked prison door; Only as strong as our love for this land; Only as tall as we stand. This song later became part of the repertoire of the U.S. Army band.And in 1968, in a famous anti-war speech, Norman Thomas, the aging leader of the Socialist Party, proclaimed, ""I come to cleanse the American flag, not burn it.""In recent decades, Bruce Springsteen has most closely followed in the Guthrie tradition. From ""Born in the USA,"" to his songs about Tom Joad (the militant protagonist in John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath), to his anthem about the 9/11 tragedy (""Empty Sky""), to his album Wrecking Ball (including its opening song, ""We Take Care of Our Own""), Springsteen has championed the downtrodden while challenging America to live up to its ideals.Steve (""Little Stevie"") Van Zandt is best known as the guitarist with Springsteen's E Street Band and for his role as Silvio Dante, Tony Soprano's sidekick on the TV show, ""The Sopranos."" But his most enduring legacy should be his love song about America, ""I Am a Patriot,"" including these lyrics:I am a patriot, and I love my country; Because my country is all I know. Wanna be with my family; People who understand me; I got no place else to go. And I ain't no communist, And I ain't no socialist, And I ain't no capitalist, And I ain't no imperialist, And I ain't no Democrat, Sure ain't no Republican either, I only know one party, And that is freedom. Since the American Revolution, each generation of progressives has expressed an American patriotism rooted in democratic values that challenged jingoism and ""my country -- right or wrong"" thinking. They rejected blind nationalism, militaristic drum beating, and sheep-like conformism. Throughout the United States' history, they have viewed their movements -- abolition of slavery, farmers' populism, women's suffrage, workers' rights, civil rights, environmentalism, gay rights, and others -- as profoundly patriotic. They believed that America's core claims -- fairness, equality, freedom, justice -- were their own.America now confronts a new version of the Gilded Age, brought upon by Wall Street greed and corporate malfeasance. In the midst of a recession, the gap between rich and poor is still widening. Although the economy has improved in recent years, Americans are feeling more economically insecure than at any time since the Depression. They are upset by the unbridled selfishness and political influence-peddling demonstrated by banks, oil companies, drug companies, insurance companies, and other large corporations. They are angry at the growing power of American-based global firms who show no loyalty to their country, outsource jobs to low-wage countries, avoid paying taxes, and pollute the environment. We are, once again, battling over immigration and who belongs in America. Some right-wing groups and talk-show pundits, calling themselves patriots, have even challenged the citizenship of our president. These trends have triggered a growing grassroots movement -- reflected by Occupy Wall Street, the Fight for 15, the Dreamers, Black Lives Matter, and others -- involving a diverse coalition of community groups, immigrant rights organizations, unions, consumer advocates, and human rights activists -- demanding stronger regulations to protect consumers, workers, and the environment from abusive corporations, living wages, fairer trade, an end to police abuse and mass incarceration, and higher taxes on the very rich to pay for better schools, safer roads, and student loans.This movement, which embodies the idea of ""liberty and justice for all,"" reflects America's tradition of progressive patriotism. It recognizes that conservatives have never had a monopoly on Old Glory.Happy July 4th.Peter Dreier teaches politics at Occidental College.

And I ain't no communist, And I ain't no socialist, And I ain't no capitalist, And I ain't no imperialist, And I ain't no Democrat, Sure ain't no Republican either, I only know one party, And that is freedom. Since the American Revolution, each generation of progressives has expressed an American patriotism rooted in democratic values that challenged jingoism and ""my country -- right or wrong"" thinking. They rejected blind nationalism, militaristic drum beating, and sheep-like conformism. Throughout the United States' history, they have viewed their movements -- abolition of slavery, farmers' populism, women's suffrage, workers' rights, civil rights, environmentalism, gay rights, and others -- as profoundly patriotic. They believed that America's core claims -- fairness, equality, freedom, justice -- were their own.America now confronts a new version of the Gilded Age, brought upon by Wall Street greed and corporate malfeasance. In the midst of a recession, the gap between rich and poor is still widening. Although the economy has improved in recent years, Americans are feeling more economically insecure than at any time since the Depression. They are upset by the unbridled selfishness and political influence-peddling demonstrated by banks, oil companies, drug companies, insurance companies, and other large corporations. They are angry at the growing power of American-based global firms who show no loyalty to their country, outsource jobs to low-wage countries, avoid paying taxes, and pollute the environment. We are, once again, battling over immigration and who belongs in America. Some right-wing groups and talk-show pundits, calling themselves patriots, have even challenged the citizenship of our president. These trends have triggered a growing grassroots movement -- reflected by Occupy Wall Street, the Fight for 15, the Dreamers, Black Lives Matter, and others -- involving a diverse coalition of community groups, immigrant rights organizations, unions, consumer advocates, and human rights activists -- demanding stronger regulations to protect consumers, workers, and the environment from abusive corporations, living wages, fairer trade, an end to police abuse and mass incarceration, and higher taxes on the very rich to pay for better schools, safer roads, and student loans.This movement, which embodies the idea of ""liberty and justice for all,"" reflects America's tradition of progressive patriotism. It recognizes that conservatives have never had a monopoly on Old Glory.Happy July 4th.Peter Dreier teaches politics at Occidental College.

Our world, especially with the rise of life online, is incredibly visual and connected. How does ballet fit into this? One of the best parts of our world being more connected is the ability to share stories. Everything we do in life is based on the stories we tell ourselves and the stories we tell each other, and ballet is part of that story.

Conceivable?Here are my ""cases"" -- my suggested viewings: The Sea Inside (Mar Adentro)  This 2004 dramatization depicts an actual years-long effort by a quadriplegic to get government approval (in Spain) for assisted suicide. It was acclaimed as the Best Foreign Language Film of the year by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In addition to the Oscar, it won the Golden Globe as Best Foreign Language Film. Diving into a familiar sea at a low tide rip-tide or undertow, Ramón Sampedro snapped his neck against the sea floor. At that youthful moment, he had been distracted by youthful thoughts. But he has had years and years (almost three decades) of incapacity to reflect and reconsider. He has never wavered. I want to die because life for me in this condition has no dignity. I understand that other quadriplegics might get offended by what I say about not having any dignity. I don't judge anyone. Who am I to judge those who want to live. That's why I ask that neither me, nor the person who helps me die, be judged.But there are judges to be convinced. Despite throngs of vocal supporters outside the courthouse (parading ""Decriminalize Euthanasia Now"" placards), and despite coolheaded advocacies to the bench, the judges are not moved.Ever clear-headed, Ramón wonders if people who are shocked by his wish to die, somehow imagine that what he suffers and desires might be contagious.   At their Galician farmhouse, he is well-attended by his nephew and lovingly-attended by his devoted sister-in-law. After decades of having his personal pleas ignored, his plight is championed by a right-to-die-with-dignity advocate and empathetic lawyers. After television interviews (based on actual TV appearances), he is visited by a stranger who is touched by his plight: The young woman first tries to talk him out of his death wish, and then...  The sea gave him a full life, and then took it away At the age of 19, Ramón went to sea, and through photos we see that he traveled the world and experienced the world quite fully. He explains, ""Sailors travel the world for free."" But with his freedom gone so completely, he asks anyone offering friendship to be his friend by respecting his wishes. And he ""pens"" his poetical pleas by using a drawing stick he designed, which allows him to compose and record his longings. Even with only restricted movements of mouth and chin, he forms letters on a scroll that he conceived and which his nephew and father constructed. These writings will become part of his legacy.   The debate -- ecclesiastical versus humanistic  A particularly energizing and entertaining scene has bed-ridden Ramón parrying a priest's arguments that are relayed up to him by the priest's young acolyte. The priest is also a quadriplegic. His wheelchair cannot be maneuvered up the narrow stairwell to Ramón's room. Up and down, up and down, the acolyte delivers the doctrine and returns with Ramón's calm rebuttals. Perspiring and short of breath, the acolyte's face suggests that he is not familiar with refutations to the priest's gospel.   Tilting at The Church and the judiciary On his way to a courtroom, we are treated to scenic Spain and Ramón seems transfixed by the turning blades of a turbine wind-farm. Director and screenwriter Alejandro Amenábar must surely have wanted us to think of another Spaniard -- Don Quixote -- whose imagination and delusions did him in. Ramón tilts at provincial windmills, jousting with the clergy and the courts.   But Ramón Sampedro is ""serene and perfectly lucid"" - his realities make him want to finish the job. He may be dreaming ""the impossible dream."" Amenábar fashioned scenes in which Ramón flies out his bedroom window to soar above Galician-like landscapes, all the way to the sea. These flights are set to Puccini's ""Nessun Dorma,"" which translates to ""none shall sleep."" The flights are moving in a number of ways. One is reminded of the Manhattan overflights of Alejandro Iñárritu's Birdman. The escape fantasies are much more than escapism. There are ""escape"" plans in both Me Before You and in Whose Life Is It Anyway? However, in neither story do we see or read of the very final passage to passing. By contrast, in The Sea Inside, with Javier Bardem delivering the words that were actually spoken by the long-suffering quadriplegic, we bear witness - figuratively, and quite literally - to the last straw. Whose Life Is It Anyway? ""You are now part of the optimism industry. Everyone who deals with me acts as though, for the first time in the history of medical science, a ruptured spinal column will heal itself - it's just a bit of a bore waiting for it to happen.""In Brian Clark's play, sculptor Ken Harrison is essentially left with only the use of his brain, following ""a roadway accident."" After six months in the ER and intensive care units, he asks the chief physician at the hospital where he is ""housed"" for a prognosis:KH: ""I'm not asking you for a guarantee on oath. I am simply asking for your professional opinion. Do you believe I will ever walk again?Dr. Emerson: ""No.""KH: ""Or recover the use of my arms?""Dr. Emerson: ""No.""KH: ""Thank you... for your honesty.""  The arguments for accepting ""acceptance"" As a quadriplegic, sculptor Ken Harrison is nevertheless told, ""It's surprising how we can come to accept things."" In a following scene, the chief physician persists:Dr. Emerson: ""You will find that as you gain acceptance of the situation you will be able to find a new way of living.""Harrison counters that he has accepted the fact that his existence is not a life he chooses to live - and thus he wants to end his existence. A social worker is assigned to acquaint Harrison with possibilities for a life using a special-designed reading machine and an adapted typewriter.   Declining to accept ""acceptance"" Harrison, the former sculptor, counters: ""How about an electronically-operated hammer and chisel? No? How about a cybernetic lump of clay?"" However wondrous the options, there's no device that would allow Harrison to think, imagine, and create through his hands.  ""I have absolutely no desire at all to be the object of scientific virtuosity... I do not want to go on living with so much effort for so little result.""   In 1978 on a London stage, in 1979 on a New York stage With Tom Conti playing Harrison, playwright Brian Clark forced theatre-goers to witness and weigh the moral mandates of the hospital (preserve life -- whatever that life is and may be) against the immobile utterly-dependent patient's wishes not to be preserved. Hospital heroics have brought Harrison back from death, but all those medical marvels cannot bring back the life he had so cherished. He does not want to continue to be relegated to ""a fate worse than death."" To his lawyer: 'With all respect, I know that our hospitals are wonderful. I know that many people have succeeded in making good lives with appalling handicaps. I'm happy for them, and I respect and admire them. But each person must make their own decision. And mine is to die quietly and with as much dignity as I can muster -- and I need your help.' Would a judge's judgment still be necessary today? The hospital makes its case for compulsory commitment under a provision of the Mental Health Law that deals with those who are clinically depressed and thus unable to make rational decisions. To the extent she can, Dr. Clare Scott tries to win over the hospital: ""But surely a wish to die is not necessarily a symptom of insanity? A man might want to die for perfectly sane reasons."" We read and hear of ""the trap"" -- ""the Catch-22."" ""If you're clever and sane enough to put up an invincible case for suicide, it demonstrates you ought not to die."" Harrison has sent away his girlfriend -- ""to release her from a lifetime of sacrifice"" and by way of holding on to some semblance of self-respect, some dignity.""Dignity,"" he argues, ""begins with choice."" He had worked many years to achieve art in sculpture; he does not wish to be ""a medical achievement.""   Physical incapacity - and the legal incapacity to choose""I can't do the things I want to do. I want it recognized that, for me, life is over.... as far as I'm concerned, I'm dead already.... I cannot accept that this condition constitutes life in any real sense at all.... Everything is geared just to keeping my brain active, with no real possibility of it ever being able to direct anything. As far as I can see, this is an act of deliberate cruelty."" Stage to screen The play was honored with the 1978 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play and with a Tony best play nomination in 1979. In the 1981 film adaptation, Brian Clark's screenplay and John Badham's direction gave Richard Dreyfuss opportunities to bring even more wit and considerable poignancy to the plight and the medical-moral point-counterpoint. In the film, we get to see how Harrison sketched, and how he molded clay. We get to see his studio and his creations - all of which convey balletic movement. What sustained him, what enlivened him and what he lived for, was his sculpting. What inspired him was a love he cannot reciprocate in full.  Devising a case for release, and freedom Harrison argues that the discharge he seeks is perfectly reasonable - and sane - given his particular circumstances. Rather than try to prove that Harrison is merely manifesting a quite understandable ""reactive depression,"" in contrast to ""clinical depression,"" his lawyer makes the novel argument that it is unlawful to detain Harrison's ""body"" and that ""the body"" should be released under the doctrine of habeas corpus.In the film, a Boston judge hears these arguments with the parties assembled in the hospital's small unprepossessing library. After consulting actual judicial decisions concerning ""real life"" people (actual bodies) that were hooked up to life-support machinery, the judge renders this analysis:  ""A deliberate decision to embark on a course of action that will lead inevitably to death is not ipso facto evidence of insanity. If it were, society would have to reward many men with a dishonorable burial rather than a posthumous medal for gallantry."" The ruling frees Harrison: his body cannot be lawfully detained.   Maneuvering ""life"" in a wheelchair  Louisa Clark, the life-enhancing presence in Jojo Moyes' Me Before You, tells us that ""There are things you don't notice until you accompany someone in a wheelchair. One is how rubbish most pavements are, pockmarked with badly patched holes, or just plain uneven. Walking slowly next to Will as he wheeled himself along, I saw how every uneven slab caused him to jolt painfully, or how often he had to steer carefully around some potential obstacle.... The other thing is how inconsiderate most drivers are. They park up against the sloped cutouts on the sidewalks, or so close together that there is no way for a wheelchair to actually cross the road...."" Were it not for Louisa's Internet investigations, I would not have known of the Online quad community and their chat-rooms, which provided her with so much courage, generosity, imagination, encouragement and support. Me Before You - A Life-Enhancing Presence, a Life-Enhancing PresentIn the men's room of the multiplex where I saw Me Before You, I noticed a wheelchair protruding from the wheelchair-accessible stall. The wheelchair couldn't make it all the way through the supposedly-wide-enough stall doorway. At the same multiplex, prior to the feature film, my view of humanity was coarsened by the insipid on-screen promos, violent video-game samplers, and previews of coming attractions that featured relentless brutality and inhumanity. The humor and decency of Me Before You provided antidotes.   Tragedy and necessity, the mothers of invention  With the help of his father and nephew, Ramón Sampedro, once a ship's mechanic and inventor-by-fate, designed (for farm-shed-fabrication) a mechanized wheelchair, a wheelchair-ramped car, an overhead cord-and-ring that allowed him to answer the phone by pulling on the cord with his teeth. His ""drafting table"" was a scroll he inscribed with the tooth-held stick-pencil he had conceived, as the rest of his body shriveled and atrophied.A personal Brexit With Traynor wealth and major-G Internet, Will Traynor was able to purchase a high-end adapted minivan equipped with a retractable ramp; voice-recognition software, bathing hoists and state-of-the-art hygiene aids, professional nursing care, the initially-awkward attentions of chatty upbeat Louisa Clark - and a dignified leave-taking not available in Great Britain. Will Traynor's plight - and desire for a self-determined exit - was not without real-life precedent. Parliamentary debate and inaction led an actual British family to their own Brexit. Without naming the family, Jojo Moyes wove that actual case into her story-telling. She has Nathan, Will Traynor's steady and ultra-competent nurse, provide Louisa with what may or may not serve as precedent - but which informs, and paves the way.  ""He's not going to get better.... I can't judge what he wants to do. That's his choice.... I want him to live. Only if he wants to live.""To the extent literature and film can do so, The Sea Inside, Whose Life Is It Anyway?, and Me Before You place us (the willing among us) in the wheelchairs and beds of quadriplegics. We learn about their predicaments - we can almost feel their discomfort; we can begin to imagine their disinclinations and despair.We learn that when so much freedom is gone - the freedom to choose becomes all the more precious. Shouldn't society allow for a final freedom - the liberty to be liberated from suffering, and undying uncertainty.

He explains, ""Sailors travel the world for free."" But with his freedom gone so completely, he asks anyone offering friendship to be his friend by respecting his wishes. And he ""pens"" his poetical pleas by using a drawing stick he designed, which allows him to compose and record his longings. Even with only restricted movements of mouth and chin, he forms letters on a scroll that he conceived and which his nephew and father constructed. These writings will become part of his legacy.   The debate -- ecclesiastical versus humanistic  A particularly energizing and entertaining scene has bed-ridden Ramón parrying a priest's arguments that are relayed up to him by the priest's young acolyte. The priest is also a quadriplegic. His wheelchair cannot be maneuvered up the narrow stairwell to Ramón's room. Up and down, up and down, the acolyte delivers the doctrine and returns with Ramón's calm rebuttals. Perspiring and short of breath, the acolyte's face suggests that he is not familiar with refutations to the priest's gospel.   Tilting at The Church and the judiciary On his way to a courtroom, we are treated to scenic Spain and Ramón seems transfixed by the turning blades of a turbine wind-farm. Director and screenwriter Alejandro Amenábar must surely have wanted us to think of another Spaniard -- Don Quixote -- whose imagination and delusions did him in. Ramón tilts at provincial windmills, jousting with the clergy and the courts.   But Ramón Sampedro is ""serene and perfectly lucid"" - his realities make him want to finish the job. He may be dreaming ""the impossible dream."" Amenábar fashioned scenes in which Ramón flies out his bedroom window to soar above Galician-like landscapes, all the way to the sea. These flights are set to Puccini's ""Nessun Dorma,"" which translates to ""none shall sleep."" The flights are moving in a number of ways. One is reminded of the Manhattan overflights of Alejandro Iñárritu's Birdman. The escape fantasies are much more than escapism. There are ""escape"" plans in both Me Before You and in Whose Life Is It Anyway? However, in neither story do we see or read of the very final passage to passing. By contrast, in The Sea Inside, with Javier Bardem delivering the words that were actually spoken by the long-suffering quadriplegic, we bear witness - figuratively, and quite literally - to the last straw. Whose Life Is It Anyway? ""You are now part of the optimism industry. Everyone who deals with me acts as though, for the first time in the history of medical science, a ruptured spinal column will heal itself - it's just a bit of a bore waiting for it to happen.""In Brian Clark's play, sculptor Ken Harrison is essentially left with only the use of his brain, following ""a roadway accident."" After six months in the ER and intensive care units, he asks the chief physician at the hospital where he is ""housed"" for a prognosis:KH: ""I'm not asking you for a guarantee on oath. I am simply asking for your professional opinion. Do you believe I will ever walk again?Dr. Emerson: ""No.""KH: ""Or recover the use of my arms?""Dr. Emerson: ""No.""KH: ""Thank you... for your honesty.""  The arguments for accepting ""acceptance"" As a quadriplegic, sculptor Ken Harrison is nevertheless told, ""It's surprising how we can come to accept things."" In a following scene, the chief physician persists:Dr. Emerson: ""You will find that as you gain acceptance of the situation you will be able to find a new way of living.""Harrison counters that he has accepted the fact that his existence is not a life he chooses to live - and thus he wants to end his existence. A social worker is assigned to acquaint Harrison with possibilities for a life using a special-designed reading machine and an adapted typewriter.   Declining to accept ""acceptance"" Harrison, the former sculptor, counters: ""How about an electronically-operated hammer and chisel? No? How about a cybernetic lump of clay?"" However wondrous the options, there's no device that would allow Harrison to think, imagine, and create through his hands.  ""I have absolutely no desire at all to be the object of scientific virtuosity... I do not want to go on living with so much effort for so little result.""   In 1978 on a London stage, in 1979 on a New York stage With Tom Conti playing Harrison, playwright Brian Clark forced theatre-goers to witness and weigh the moral mandates of the hospital (preserve life -- whatever that life is and may be) against the immobile utterly-dependent patient's wishes not to be preserved. Hospital heroics have brought Harrison back from death, but all those medical marvels cannot bring back the life he had so cherished. He does not want to continue to be relegated to ""a fate worse than death."" To his lawyer: 'With all respect, I know that our hospitals are wonderful. I know that many people have succeeded in making good lives with appalling handicaps. I'm happy for them, and I respect and admire them. But each person must make their own decision. And mine is to die quietly and with as much dignity as I can muster -- and I need your help.' Would a judge's judgment still be necessary today? The hospital makes its case for compulsory commitment under a provision of the Mental Health Law that deals with those who are clinically depressed and thus unable to make rational decisions. To the extent she can, Dr. Clare Scott tries to win over the hospital: ""But surely a wish to die is not necessarily a symptom of insanity? A man might want to die for perfectly sane reasons."" We read and hear of ""the trap"" -- ""the Catch-22."" ""If you're clever and sane enough to put up an invincible case for suicide, it demonstrates you ought not to die."" Harrison has sent away his girlfriend -- ""to release her from a lifetime of sacrifice"" and by way of holding on to some semblance of self-respect, some dignity.""Dignity,"" he argues, ""begins with choice."" He had worked many years to achieve art in sculpture; he does not wish to be ""a medical achievement.""   Physical incapacity - and the legal incapacity to choose""I can't do the things I want to do. I want it recognized that, for me, life is over.... as far as I'm concerned, I'm dead already.... I cannot accept that this condition constitutes life in any real sense at all.... Everything is geared just to keeping my brain active, with no real possibility of it ever being able to direct anything. As far as I can see, this is an act of deliberate cruelty."" Stage to screen The play was honored with the 1978 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play and with a Tony best play nomination in 1979. In the 1981 film adaptation, Brian Clark's screenplay and John Badham's direction gave Richard Dreyfuss opportunities to bring even more wit and considerable poignancy to the plight and the medical-moral point-counterpoint. In the film, we get to see how Harrison sketched, and how he molded clay. We get to see his studio and his creations - all of which convey balletic movement. What sustained him, what enlivened him and what he lived for, was his sculpting. What inspired him was a love he cannot reciprocate in full.  Devising a case for release, and freedom Harrison argues that the discharge he seeks is perfectly reasonable - and sane - given his particular circumstances. Rather than try to prove that Harrison is merely manifesting a quite understandable ""reactive depression,"" in contrast to ""clinical depression,"" his lawyer makes the novel argument that it is unlawful to detain Harrison's ""body"" and that ""the body"" should be released under the doctrine of habeas corpus.In the film, a Boston judge hears these arguments with the parties assembled in the hospital's small unprepossessing library. After consulting actual judicial decisions concerning ""real life"" people (actual bodies) that were hooked up to life-support machinery, the judge renders this analysis:  ""A deliberate decision to embark on a course of action that will lead inevitably to death is not ipso facto evidence of insanity. If it were, society would have to reward many men with a dishonorable burial rather than a posthumous medal for gallantry."" The ruling frees Harrison: his body cannot be lawfully detained.   Maneuvering ""life"" in a wheelchair  Louisa Clark, the life-enhancing presence in Jojo Moyes' Me Before You, tells us that ""There are things you don't notice until you accompany someone in a wheelchair. One is how rubbish most pavements are, pockmarked with badly patched holes, or just plain uneven. Walking slowly next to Will as he wheeled himself along, I saw how every uneven slab caused him to jolt painfully, or how often he had to steer carefully around some potential obstacle.... The other thing is how inconsiderate most drivers are. They park up against the sloped cutouts on the sidewalks, or so close together that there is no way for a wheelchair to actually cross the road....""

Me Before You - A Life-Enhancing Presence, a Life-Enhancing PresentIn the men's room of the multiplex where I saw Me Before You, I noticed a wheelchair protruding from the wheelchair-accessible stall. The wheelchair couldn't make it all the way through the supposedly-wide-enough stall doorway. At the same multiplex, prior to the feature film, my view of humanity was coarsened by the insipid on-screen promos, violent video-game samplers, and previews of coming attractions that featured relentless brutality and inhumanity. The humor and decency of Me Before You provided antidotes.   Tragedy and necessity, the mothers of invention  With the help of his father and nephew, Ramón Sampedro, once a ship's mechanic and inventor-by-fate, designed (for farm-shed-fabrication) a mechanized wheelchair, a wheelchair-ramped car, an overhead cord-and-ring that allowed him to answer the phone by pulling on the cord with his teeth.

Will Traynor's plight - and desire for a self-determined exit - was not without real-life precedent. Parliamentary debate and inaction led an actual British family to their own Brexit. Without naming the family, Jojo Moyes wove that actual case into her story-telling.

Efforts by Texas (and other states) to limit a pregnant woman's decision-making and her access to pre-natal options, have been thwarted -- for now.

It was acclaimed as the Best Foreign Language Film of the year by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In addition to the Oscar, it won the Golden Globe as Best Foreign Language Film. Diving into a familiar sea at a low tide rip-tide or undertow, Ramón Sampedro snapped his neck against the sea floor. At that youthful moment, he had been distracted by youthful thoughts. But he has had years and years (almost three decades) of incapacity to reflect and reconsider. He has never wavered. I want to die because life for me in this condition has no dignity. I understand that other quadriplegics might get offended by what I say about not having any dignity. I don't judge anyone. Who am I to judge those who want to live. That's why I ask that neither me, nor the person who helps me die, be judged.But there are judges to be convinced. Despite throngs of vocal supporters outside the courthouse (parading ""Decriminalize Euthanasia Now"" placards), and despite coolheaded advocacies to the bench, the judges are not moved.Ever clear-headed, Ramón wonders if people who are shocked by his wish to die, somehow imagine that what he suffers and desires might be contagious.   At their Galician farmhouse, he is well-attended by his nephew and lovingly-attended by his devoted sister-in-law. After decades of having his personal pleas ignored, his plight is championed by a right-to-die-with-dignity advocate and empathetic lawyers.

8,POLITICS,Republican Senator Has To Be Asked Three Times To Explain Why He Supports Donald Trump,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-tom-cotton_us_57791a59e4b0416464104958,"He says Trump can ""make the case for himself.""",2016-07-03,"Sen. Tom Cotton had a lot to say about Hillary Clinton, but not so much to offer on Donald Trump. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57791b4e1800002500fa3bae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) had a hard time coming up with a reason why he supports presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump when pressed by Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday morning.Cotton, a leading proponent of an aggressive neoconservative foreign policy, was asked by Todd whether he is closer in foreign policy terms to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton than Trump, who, while promoting a bombastic and confrontational foreign policy for the United States, has also called for the country to pull back from some international conflicts and commitments. Cotton had a hard time mustering up an answer.“Well, I can assure you that I'm not very close to Hillary Clinton,” Cotton said. “I think she's disqualified herself from commander in chief by her cavalier attitude towards our nation's secrecy laws. And she has been responsible for many of the worst decisions of the Obama administration.”Cotton ran down a list of Clinton policies he objected to, from the reset with Russia to the NATO bombing campaign in Libya that helped topple dictator Muammar Gaddafi. He did not, however, give a reason why he supported Trump.“What's the case for Trump?” Todd asked. “You just did a whole speech, by the way, earlier this weekend. You didn't even mention his name. You laid out a strong case against her. But you did not make a case for him. Make the case for him.”Cotton tried to respond once again with criticisms of Clinton, before Todd cut him off to demand he give a case for Trump as nominee.Cotton’s response was not enthusiastic: “Donald Trump can ultimately make the case for himself. But Donald Trump, like most Americans, like most Republicans, believe in protecting America's core national interests. He believes, as do I, as do most Americans, that we aren't yet doing enough to take the fight to the Islamic State. That the intervention in Libya was ill-considered and slapdash at the time.""""And we're living with the consequences of it now,"" Cotton continued. ""That we have to get tougher when it comes to our intelligence and law enforcement practices to stop Islamic terrorism. On those matters, our party is largely united. And I say that we have the vast majority of Americans with us.”Todd followed up by noting the freshman senator’s seeming disinterest. “You don't come across as an enthusiastic Trump supporter,"" Todd said. ""Is that fair?”To which Cotton deadpanned: “Maybe I don't just demonstrate enthusiasm much in life, Chuck, especially in such dangerous times as this.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

It was likely abandoned when it wouldn’t go off, The New York Daily News reported, citing a high-ranking police source.A bomb squad inspected the scene and found no evidence of terrorism. Authorities said they don't believe the device was meant to harm anyone. “It was not set up with any sophistication. If he was going to harm people, he wouldn’t have put it far off the path. They also would have put some nails or ball bearings in it,” a police official told The Daily News.The victim’s friends appeared just as shocked and confused as everyone else and denied carrying fireworks when questioned shortly after.“We don’t know what happened. There was a small explosion and then dust,” one of two friends told reporters at the scene.Golden's grandmother, speaking to The Post, said her grandson is an avid rock climber and music engineering student at the University of Miami. He had gone to NYC to visit friends for the Fourth of July weekend. “I get chills wondering if Connor knows yet whether his leg has been amputated,” his grandmother, Roberta Golden, said.The teen's grandfather, Terence Golden, appeared equally shook up when reached by an NBC reporter.""Hopefully it's going to work out for him. This is a life-changing thing for this poor young man,"" Terence Golden said.Initial reports said Golden was in critical but stable condition at Bellevue Hospital.Witnesses described hearing the loud blast from several blocks away.New York Times reporter Sarah Maslin Nir was outside the nearby funeral service for Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel when she heard the explosion. Nir tweeted that she ran to the scene, where she ""found a young man with his leg blown off."" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted a story about the incident, asking people to leave fireworks ""to the professionals.""Consumer fireworks are illegal in the city.

10,POLITICS,Donald Trump’s Trade Plan Will Hurt The Very People He Promises To Help,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-trade-policy_us_577809eee4b09b4c43c0b2b0,"His agenda is good for the haves, not the have-nots.",2016-07-03,A runner jogs along the frozen Allegheny River in downtown Pittsburgh..,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s big speech about trade on Tuesday was relatively free of brazen lies. But the underlying message of the address -- a promise that his presidency would work out well for working-class Americans -- was as misleading as anything he’s said on the campaign trail.The setting for the speech was Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where employment in the region’s historic steel industry has declined by 44 percent since 1990. As president, Trump vowed, he would stop and even reverse that decline by getting tough with China, Mexico and other trading partners -- slapping tariffs on their exports, punishing them with sanctions and rewriting the trade agreements that, according to Trump, have allowed these countries to steal American jobs.“The error of economic surrender will be over,” the presumptive Republican nominee proclaimed. “A new era of prosperity will finally begin.”But in making this case, Trump wasn’t simply talking about trade, or even manufacturing more generally. He was also talking about a divide in American politics between the masses and the privileged few -- and why he, not presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is the candidate on the side of the masses.The claim is totally at odds with what Trump is actually proposing to do as president.In talking about trade and its impact on areas like western Pennsylvania, Trump has identified a real and serious problem. Overall, most economists would agree, trade has been beneficial -- by reducing the prices of consumer goods, creating new markets for exports and allowing the economy to grow faster. And that’s to say nothing of the ways economic integration has reduced international conflict.But that doesn’t mean every individual or every group of people is better off, and recent research has confirmed what some trade skeptics and labor advocates have been saying all along: Trade can be absolutely punishing to communities that lose manufacturing jobs to competitors overseas. In those places, cheaper goods and other benefits of trade are small consolation for jobs that no longer exist.As Brookings economist Henry Aaron put it recently in an interview, “Opening up freer trade is good for the nation…as a whole and in the long run. … But it hurts some American companies, and that means some American workers, too.”The trouble is that undoing trade’s effects on areas like western Pennsylvania would be a heck of a lot more difficult than Trump makes it sound. Ripping up the old trade agreements and imposing massive new tariffs would likely set off a trade war that would have the precise opposite effect of liberalized trade: Prices would rise and growth would slow.These kinds of trade-offs in trade policy are by no means hypothetical. In fact, it’s possible to see a miniature version of them playing out right now. Earlier this year, the U.S. slapped tariffs as high as 266 percent on some forms of Chinese steel because of a U.S. government finding that the Chinese were “dumping” their products on the market -- in other words, selling steel at unreasonably low prices, well below cost, in order to prop up the Chinese steel industry.Steelmakers in the U.S. are thrilled but, as the Wall Street Journal reported in June, the tariffs are a “double-edged sword.” Companies that manufacture goods with imported steel say they will have to raise prices and one executive, from a firm that manufacturers school chalkboards, told the Journal that his company might have to shutter a factory because customers would be cutting back on orders.That’s not an argument against such targeted tariffs, which arguably represent the kind of retaliatory and remedial action necessary to keep a free trade regime functioning. There’s a balance to be struck, between easing restrictions on trade and reinforcing the standards that matter. Even among relatively like-minded economists, there’s a vigorous debate about where exactly that balance should be. But the very real costs to even this highly defensible tariff on Chinese steel dumping is a reminder that aggressive trade policies have very real downsides -- and that an all-out, indiscriminate assault on existing trade arrangements, like the one Trump seems to have in mind, could easily leave working-class Americans much worse off than they are today.That’s particularly true given the rest of Trump’s agenda. His statements about policy are infrequent, vague and sometimes contradictory, making it difficult to pinpoint exactly what he would do as president. But the one policy proposal he has outlined in detail -- his tax cut -- reveals quite a lot. He would lower taxes on both corporations and individuals, reducing government revenue by something like $10 trillion over the next 10 years, according to analysis by the Brookings- and Urban Institute-run Tax Policy Center.That’s a lot of money, even by the standards of Republican tax cuts. And while the wealthiest Americans would get windfalls from Trump’s plan, working-class Americans would get significantly less money, in both absolute and proportional terms.Of course, Trump claims his tax cut would make the economy grow even faster. But the quick addition of so much new debt, combined with the contractionary effect of Trump’s new tariffs, could lead to a sudden and serious recession, as a recent report from Moody’s Analytics suggested.And for working-class people, the real cost of the tax cut might come over the longer term, since the loss of so much revenue would almost certainly require massive spending cuts -- first to discretionary programs like education, infrastructure maintenance or biomedical research; and later to entitlements, including Medicare and Social Security, even though Trump has pledged to protect those programs.""It is hard to see how you finance that without decimating defense spending, Social Security, or Medicare,"" Jesse Rothstein, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of California, Berkeley, said. ""There’d need to be big cuts to a wide range of services and supports.""Throw in Trump’s vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act and musings that he might lower the federal minimum wage standard, and the likely end result of Trump’s economic agenda would be an economy providing even fewer well-paying jobs -- and a government in an even weaker position to help those struggling to find work.During the Pittsburgh speech, Trump repeatedly cited data from the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that champions working-class Americans and has been among the most critical of free trade agreements. But ever since Trump spoke, EPI’s researchers have also been among the most vocal in pointing out that Trump’s policies, on the whole, would hurt the very people he’s claiming to defend. (See, for example, the interview that EPI president Lawrence Mishel gave to the Washington Post’s Greg Sargent.)What working-class Americans really need, the folks at EPI say, is a much broader effort to raise their living standards. That effort might start with a more aggressive posture on trade. But it would also include stronger unions, spending on public works, more financial assistance with child care and other necessities -- as well as better support for people who lose their jobs. “Cutting taxes on the rich (another Trump goal) will only hurt working people,” Robert Scott, EPI’s chief economist and a supporter of more aggressive trade policies, told The Huffington Post in an email. “We need to fix the domestic economy -- rebuild U.S. infrastructure, which will take lots of public spending and tax revenues, and tax carbon and make the transition to a clean energy economy, which is also not cheap, and invest in rebuilding manufacturing, and invest in the social safety net.”And Trump, Scott says, “is not the guy to do any of these things.”Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-big-money-self-funding_us_57782c5de4b09b4c43c0b5b9,"Republicans don't seem to care about his big money flip-flop, but it's a problem for independents -- and donors.",2016-07-03,"A woman meets Trump at a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, Tuesday, June 28, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ST. CLAIRSVILLE, Ohio -- If a candidate solicits big money from special interests, that candidate is on the take.Or so argued presidential candidate Donald Trump -- the same Donald Trump who now, as the presumptive Republican nominee and despite that year-long stance, is nevertheless soliciting big money from those same special interests.Developer Llwyd Ecclestone and his wife, Diana, gave the Trump ""Victory"" fund $768,000. Real estate investor Thomas Barrack gave $299,600, while casino magnate Phillip Ruffin kicked in $284,600.Those donations were from May, when just 51 individuals giving a minimum of $19,600 contributed $3.1 million to Trump's fund for transfer to the Republican National Committee, according to Federal Election Commission filings.Trump has held additional big-ticket fundraisers since then, with more scheduled in the coming days and weeks. One set for the Wednesday before the nominating convention asks a minimum $25,000 per person, up to the legal maximum of $449,400.The good news for the self-described billionaire is that his hard-core supporters do not seem to care.A HuffPost/YouGov poll found that a full 64 percent of Republicans who had voted for Trump in the primaries reported they were ""not bothered at all"" by Trump reversing himself on accepting special interest money -- even though 75 percent of those same Republicans had moments earlier said they were more likely to support a self-funding candidate. Only 3 percent said the new position bothered them a lot, while 30 percent said it bothered them a little.(The Internet-based poll was conducted over two days last week and included 1,000 respondents nationally. It has a margin of error of 4.7 percentage points.)A recent rally Trump staged at the Ohio University Eastern Campus provided flesh-and-blood examples of that thinking.Ruth Holland, who initially supported Ted Cruz in the Republican primary but switched to Trump because the Texas senator was “too establishment,” had no problem with Trump’s 180-degree reversal. “Why would he spend his own money when someone’s giving it to him?” said the 71-year-old retiree from Wheeling, West Virginia.JoAnn Pizzino, 62, traveled down from Steubenville to see Trump. “I’m a Trump Democrat. This is the first ‘R’ I ever voted for in my life,” she said. Although at first she said it was “very important” that candidates not take large donations, she similarly had no concerns with Trump’s half-million-dollar solicitations. “That’s okay,” she said. “The bottom line is: Anything he does is okay.”“They've lost sight of their principles,” said Regina Thomson, a Colorado delegate to the nominating convention this month and a leader in the “dump Trump” movement. “They're angry, and he says he's going to burn the house down.""Where Trump could have a problem, though, is with the voters he is trying to attract to win the general election -- independents who are angry with the system that both he and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) call “rigged.”Among independents, only 43 percent reported they were not bothered by Trump's reversal regarding big donors, with 25 percent saying it bothered them a lot and another 20 percent reporting they were bothered a little.From the very start of his candidacy last June, Trump has accused his opponents of being pawns of their major benefactors. “I don’t need anybody’s money. I’m using my own money,” he said in his announcement speech at Trump Tower. “I’m not using lobbyists, I’m not using donors. I don’t care. I’m really rich.”At the first Republican primary debate, last August, he was even more explicit in his description of the role of money in politics. “I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give,” he said. “And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.”At the following month’s debate in California, Trump continued. “The donors, the special interests, the lobbyists have very strong power over these people,” he said, referring to his opponents onstage. “I am not accepting any money from anybody. Nobody has control of me other than the people of this country.”And this February, he had scorn for politicians who took “special interest” money: “They do exactly what those folks want them to do,” he said at a South Carolina debate. “I'm the only one in either party self-funding my campaign,” he said two weeks later in Houston. ""I'm going to do what's right.""Yet just as he closed in on the nomination, Trump began acknowledging that he fully intended to seek contributions for the general election. ""You are talking about a billion dollars or a billion and a half dollars,” he told Fox News the morning after he won the Indiana primary. “I'm not looking for myself, I'm looking out for the party, so the party can compete in Senate races and House races. I want to raise money for the party.""In reality, the money “for the party” is indistinguishable from money for himself. The Republican National Committee uses the money to drive turnout for the entire GOP ticket, which is led by Trump. And in debates and speeches over 10 months, Trump made no distinction between special interest money given for the primary and that used for the general election.The irony for Trump: All the bashing of the GOP donors who were giving to his primary rivals has made it harder to now persuade them to open their wallets for him. Fundraising has been anemic, with Trump reporting all of $3.1 million raised specifically for his campaign in the month of May, a figure that includes as much as $1.9 million from the sale of hats and T-shirt. (In contrast, all-but-certain Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton raised $28 million in May directly for her campaign and another $14 million for the Democratic National Committee and nearly three dozen state parties.)Trump made his work even more difficult this week by refusing to release proof that he forgave $50 million in loans to his campaign. The campaign claimed it was preparing and sending the FEC the letter on June 23, which would convert the loans into irrevocable contributions. The FEC did not report receiving any such letter, and this week Trump’s campaign said it would include it with its report of June contributions and expenses that is due July 20.That means potential donors will have no assurance beyond Trump’s word that he will not use as much as $2,700 received from each donor to pay himself back until the day GOP delegates are scheduled to officially make him their nominee.“That's why he's having such trouble raising money, because they don't see him as an honest broker,” said Thomson, the anti-Trump activist. “I've recently dubbed him King Con. He's perpetrating one of the biggest cons on the Republican Party ever.""Trump loyalists, though, shrug it all off. Brenda Johnson, 62, drove four hours to St. Clairsville from her home near Cincinnati to see Trump. She, like his other supporters, was not at all upset by Trump’s new position on big money.“I think people should donate to Donald Trump,” she said, adding that she would if she could find a job other than at McDonald’s or White Castle. “He needs help. He’s working for the American people.”Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

CAIR said the victim was Muslim and attended the Islamic Center.The Islamic Center's imam had requested extra security following the mass shooting last month by Omar Mateen at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, about 120 miles to the north, according to CAIR and mosque spokesman Wilfredo Ruiz.Ruiz said Mateen had infrequently attended the mosque.Mateen, who was killed by police after a three-hour siege inside the club, declared himself to be an ""Islamic soldier"" and pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State militant group, according to emergency call transcripts released by the FBI last month.Ruiz criticized the Sheriff's Office for not giving them additional security, saying: ""This should not have happened.""Sheriff Mascara said statements on the attack made by mosque officials and CAIR included ""untruthful rhetoric.""(Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Mary Milliken)"

I felt that I shouldn’t have to justify why I thought it was okay for him to",2016-07-03,Just before 4th grade - he still loves the princess aisle best of all. <br>And that's okay with us.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57795d13190000230021928f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The year was 2010, and my youngest son was 4. I felt that I shouldn’t have to justify why I thought it was okay for him to wear a princess costume whenever he felt like it. But, I found that I often did, if only to placate the masses. Perhaps, I thought, it could even enlighten someone. I thought if I could get just one person to see what is true, what is healthy, and what is good about harmless self-expression, I would be more at peace.Coincidentally, around the same time that my son was heavily into princess play and dress-up, there was all this controversy going around about little boys who like to dress up in princess costumes. For example, there was the mother (Sarah Manley, a mom blogger) who allowed her preschool son to dress up like Daphne from Scooby-Doo for Halloween and created all kinds of uproar surrounding her related blog post, “My Son is Gay.” But the first line, if people actually read it, continued the story to say, “…or he’s not. I don’t care. He is still my son. And he is 5. And I am his mother. And if you have a problem with anything mentioned above, I don’t want to know you.” I was fist-bumping her from my sofa as I read those words that rang so true to me. Before that, though, there was the mom who got tired of others picking on her son who dubbed himself a “Princess Boy” and she decided to write a children’s book about acceptance. We bought the book right away. My son, who’s now 10 years old, still reads it. To date, that book has sold millions upon millions of copies, and its author, (the Princess Boy’s mother) has become an internationally renowned speaker, speaking at schools worldwide, as well as corporations, government groups, universities, and parenting organizations. She is credited with providing thought-provoking perspectives and relevant tools for change, which is exactly what she sought out when she went public with their story. In my mind, that lady ― Cheryl Kilodavis ― began this very important conversation back in 2009, when I first heard her speak on the Today Show, and realized I was not alone. The timing was perfect. Never in my life was I so happy to find that there were other moms going through the same thing as me. I didn’t know the correct word for it back in 2009, but I knew my son was different. Since the time he began verbalizing his wants, and engaging in independent play, he was always fascinated with all things poofy, sparkly, and pink. It started out as a fascination with admiring, feeling, and then wearing his older sister’s ballet costumes – for the simple reason he thought they were “pretty.” He never showed the same level of interest in his older brother’s trucks or army men. We all just thought it was a phase.By age three, not only did he prefer playing princess dress-up to anything else, but further, re-enacting scenes from his favorite movies, such as The Wizard of Oz, or Alice in Wonderland. He always wanted to play the leading lady. We still thought it was a phase he would grow out of, but I knew with a background in psychology that it was best practice not to stifle his creativity. I also refused to tell him, “you can’t; that’s for girls,” because I have always disagreed with gender stereotypes. We let our daughter play with her older brother’s toys equally. Why wouldn’t we extend the same courtesy to our sons? In our house we didn’t have “boy toys” or “girl toys.” We just had toys, and everyone was welcome to play. There wasn’t anything my husband and I did wrong in our parenting to “cause” this. I mean, of course we made – and continue to make – mistakes. But what I’m alluding to is that we did not inject him at birth with a preference for the color pink. As much as we dislike gender stereotypes, we still did our due diligence in buying him toy trucks and plastic tool sets. Because that’s what society dictates we do. But he was never interested. We wondered why he didn’t play like most boys his age. “Why is he so gentle? Why won’t he ram the fire truck into the wall like his brother did? Why do his eyes glaze over with boredom at the sight of wooden train tracks and trains? Why is he building intricate bird houses and fancy glass slippers out of the Legos instead of spaceships and airplanes?” These were questions my husband and I wondered for a long time.After much reading, research, and mom blogging, I was steered towards another blog by Lori Duron (Raising my Rainbow), about a mom and dad in California raising a gender creative son, about the same age as my own son. It dawned on me then that the correct term for my son was something I have come to learn much about: “Gender Creative.” It’s not a mental disorder. It’s not dysphoria. There is no confusion or dissatisfaction involved. My son is (at this point) very happy with being a boy and having boy parts. He simply prefers all the things that are marketed to girls.As he went through 2nd-4th grade and social interactions became more difficult, we discussed it. Often. During those three years, he was exposed to various reading materials, documentaries about transgender or gender non-conforming kids, videos, and even a respected pediatric psychologist. By the beginning of 4th grade, he told us himself that he was gender creative, what I knew all along but never said out loud to him. He said, “I’m just gender creative. I don’t want to be a girl. I just like all girl stuff.” And it really is that simple... And it really is that complicated. Before he realized it, I remember the day it occurred to me, like a light bulb over my head. It happened one morning when I had all three kids in Target to spend their Christmas gift cards. My daughter, who was six at the time, went to the little girl aisle. She surveyed the newest fashion for Barbies, the pet horses, the miniature cooking gadgets. My oldest son, nearly eight at the time, went right for the little boy aisle. He studied the complex Lego structures, the alien slime, the Star Wars figurines. Naturally, I took my youngest son, then three, to the little boy aisle. As my older two feasted their eyes on fun and exciting new possibilities, my youngest sat down on the cold hard floor, played with the Velcro on his shoes, and seemed completely detached.I tried showing him everything – all the boy stuff at his level: Jumbo blocks. Matchbox cars. Beginner’s Lego sets. These items evoked not so much as a glance. On a whim, I asked, “Honey, which aisle would you like to look at?” Thrilled that he even had a choice, he stood straight up and led me by the hand to the girl’s aisle containing princess playthings. He made a beeline to an oval, pink, full-sized mirror that lit up, and with the push of a button declared, “You are the fairest one of all!” His response was immediate: “Yes. Mommy, this is it. Please can I have this? It’s the only thing I want!” His eyes were pleading and full of innocence. It was a done deal.At the time, in a moment’s realization, I thought, “My son is a princess boy. It all makes sense now. Okay, I can get on board with this. I’m just going to not make a big deal of it, and follow his lead.” It took a little bit longer to get my husband and my son’s older siblings on the same page, though. They had already been shaped by society’s mandates for gender stereotypes. But once they got on board with it, they got on full speed ahead.I find it hard to believe that there are parents who would stifle this innocent creativity in their children. But they do exist, in spades. They have an unfortunate thought process born out of naiveté . They mistakenly believe that by allowing their son to engage in “girly” play, he will effectively “turn gay,” or that he’s confused about his gender identity and on his way to anatomical reassignment surgery. Does wearing a pink tutu make a boy gay? No. What does? Having sexual interest in the same sex. Simply put. And I can assure people that my young son, no matter how wise, is still innocent enough that he’s not sexualizing things at this stage of his life. It’s coming soon, I know. But the bigger question to me is, why is this even a concern? Whether he grows up to be gay/bi/straight/trans/questioning/queer – or whatever – my love is unconditional.Sometimes people think my son will be bully bait if he gets to “act like a girl.” This ignorant mindset that boys can’t play with girls toys is nothing but sexism, and it doesn’t come from other kids – at least not at age three, or even five, or six. The problem doesn’t seem to happen until they go home and tell their parents what they played. I learned the hard way that in the world of a little boy’s parents, playing princess dress up (which they both enjoyed doing), was akin to having sexual assault happen on my watch. However, I was watching them the whole time, and at no point did either boy remove his pants or underwear, or touch one another. They wore the princess dresses over their boy clothing. And they had a lot of fun, for hours. They even ate lunch in those dresses, and didn’t take them off until the end of the day. No one was hurt in the process.My gender creative son is now ten, and over the years I’ve heard it all. Most people seem to have a concern over my son’s safety and emotional well-being; that he’ll get picked on in school. That’s all fine and good, but I can’t guarantee anyone that my son will always be safe physically and emotionally. Nobody can guarantee that for their child. As much as I want to hold him in my arms tightly, forever and ever, and never let go, I can’t guarantee that he won’t one day be riding in a car and get killed in an accident. I can’t guarantee that kids won’t pick on him for any number of reasons – whether it’s his new sparkly pink twinkle toe sneakers, or his choice in reading partners at school on a particular day. Unfortunately, I can’t guarantee any of it.I feel that not wanting your son to feel free to express himself honestly – by wearing a dress which makes him feel pretty – for fear of his being picked on in school is at best a defense mechanism to hide the adult’s discomfort. What it’s really about is the adult’s unresolved issues with gender stereotypes. It’s about the adult not being comfortable with a boy’s effeminate tendencies. It’s about the adult squirming in his chair when he sees his male child giggling like a girl. It’s about the adult feeling the hair rise on her neck when her son twirls around like a supermodel. And that very adult problem should not be the innocent child’s shame to bear.It’s about fear, and I’m tired of living in fear. Quite frankly, so is my son, and this is the very reason he’s open and out about exactly who he is, and the reason why I write about it (with his knowledge and permission). This doesn’t make us very popular, because we are letting ourselves be vulnerable enough to be authentic. I think that too many people in this world cannot embrace vulnerability. And to me, living authentically is way more important than fitting in, or living status quo. My family knows other kids will exclude and insult, and it will most likely get worse before it gets better. In light of that, as a parent, it is my duty to make my child feel so loved, so appreciated, so accepted for who he is, so that when he does encounter people who are intolerant of differences, he can hopefully have the inner confidence to combat the insults with something enlightening or educational. As parents, we should be equipping our children with the self-confidence it takes to be brave enough to express themselves, as long as nobody is getting hurt in the process. Guess what happens when you make your innocent little preschool boy feel shame for playing a natural and normal developmentally appropriate game of dress up? He learns disgrace and embarrassment (which, by the way, are not developmentally appropriate feelings for a preschooler.) Guess what happens when you deny your young son that pretty pink thing he wants to buy with his own birthday money? You have taught him confusion, when he was just a moment ago oblivious to the skewed gender roles of our society.At my son’s fifth birthday party, one of the gifts he received was a Dorothy costume, complete with ruby slippers. None of his friends thought this was odd at the time. My son had wanted this costume for a year. I saw the glimmer of excitement in his eye after he opened it. But, I watched closely as he became aware that a few adults in the room were chuckling, joking lightly about this gift. As I focused back on my son I saw wisdom beyond his years take over his little face as he gently laid the costume and tissue paper aside. (Later on, when it was just him and his friends playing, they all raided his costume box and traded princess gowns – boys and girls alike – and my son ran around the front yard, rockin’ that Dorothy costume and ruby heels, and he kept it on until bedtime.)Later that night, though, as my husband was putting him to bed, I cried alone in my bedroom because my child was wise enough to know that some adults are uncomfortable with his choices, even though he is okay with them. Do you know what it feels like to have to defend your child’s playthings? Do you know how it undermines me when you ask what my child wants for his birthday, and I answer “princess stuff,” and you refuse to let that be the answer? Do you know how much it hurts me to know, because you can’t see past the issues of fear and embarrassment, that you will never truly appreciate the amazingly creative, honest, feeling, thinking, loving, sparkling joy that is my son?Our job as parents is to help our children love and accept themselves, and take pride in themselves, so that when the insults and harsh blows of life do come, they will know to be strong at their inner core. Even when the teasing or drama wears them down on the outside, they’ll know that at least home and heart are safe havens. My hope is that instead of rolling over and playing dead, they will one day fight back. Fight back for what is right, what is true, what is vulnerable, and what is authentic. Teach them to take pride in their whole being – each harmless quirkiness included. That is our responsibility. Until we equip our children with pride, unconditional love, and freedom, and release our own issues of discomfort or embarrassment, our children will never reveal who they really are."

28,POLITICS,The Political Revolution Continues,"Warren Gunnels, ContributorSenior Policy Advisor for Bernie Sanders",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-political-revolution-_b_10798072.html,"If the American people could achieve independence against a tyrannical government more than two centuries ago, we can create a government that works, not just for the billionaire class, but for all of our people today.",2016-07-03,Supporters reacts as they listened a speech of Democratic Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders during the event 'Where We Go From Here' in New York on June 23 2016. / AFP / KENA BETANCUR (Photo credit should read KENA BETANCUR/AFP/Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb81c8c2200004301dd3df0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than 240 years ago, American colonists embarked on a seemingly impossible political revolution. Our forefathers had the courage and the foresight to declare independence from a tyrannical monarchy and aristocracy in England that was causing economic pain and suffering for the overwhelming majority of our people.They did not do this lightly. But they made it clear to the world that enough was enough and that they could not and would not take it anymore. They were going to stand up and fight back in pursuit of liberty, justice, and freedom.Nobody gave this revolution any chance at achieving victory. The conventional wisdom was that it was doomed from the start. Britain was a superpower with one of the strongest armies the world had ever seen. How could thirteen American colonies with little money possibly rise up and establish independence against the most powerful country in the world?What was missing from this analysis was the relentless will of the American people and the birth of our ideals: That all men (and we add women) are created equal. That all of us are entitled as human beings to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That whenever a government becomes destructive of those rights it is our right as citizens to change it.If the American people could achieve independence against a tyrannical government more than two centuries ago, we can create a government that works, not just for the billionaire class, but for all of our people today. It is within our grasp to take on the greed of Wall Street, pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, and big oil companies that are ripping-off the American people and threatening the very well-being of our planet. But only if all of us are prepared to stand together and fight back, not with bayonets, but at the ballot box and by demanding that our elected leaders follow through on the commitments they make during this campaign.I have had the honor and the privilege of serving as Senator Bernie Sanders' representative on the committee responsible for writing the first draft of the platform of the Democratic Party.This draft platform, which was recently released, is not a perfect document by any stretch of the imagination. It can and must be improved when the full platform committee meets in Orlando, Florida on July 8th. But this document is a reflection of many of the ideals and aspirations of the more than 12 million Americans who voted for a new political revolution in the year 2016. Here are just a few of the accomplishments that we have already made in this platform.It is now the policy of the Democratic Party that we will fight to:• Break up too big to fail financial institutions, enact a modern version of the Glass Steagall Act, and make sure that the banking system is part of the productive economy providing loans to small-and-medium sized business to create good-paying jobs.• Prohibit Wall Street from picking and choosing which credit agency will rate their products. As The Big Short reminds us, we cannot ensure the safety and soundness of our financial system without this needed reform.• Make the Federal Reserve a more democratic institution by banning executives at financial institutions from serving on the boards of regional Federal Reserve banks or handpicking their members. During the financial crisis, it was absurd that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, was a director on the New York Fed, while his bank received over $390 billion in virtually zero interest loans from our central bank.• Ban golden parachutes for taking government jobs and crack down on the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington.• Empower the Postal Service to offer basic banking services so that low-income Americans are no longer dependent on payday lenders who charge interest rates of over 300 percent and trap millions of Americans into a viscous cycle of debt.• End corporate loopholes that allow large, profitable corporations to stash their cash in the Caymans and other offshore tax havens to avoid paying $100 billion a year in U.S. income taxes and use the revenue gained not to lower corporate tax rates, but to create millions of good-paying jobs. • Make it easier for workers to join unions if a simple majority sign valid authorization cards and require binding arbitration to ensure a first contract. America is strong when unions are strong.• Expand Social Security and extend its solvency by making those who earn more than $250,000 pay their fair share. At a time when more than half of older workers have no retirement savings, the platform recognizes that our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job is to expand it.• Allow every American to gain access to health care through Medicare or a public option. This is not everything we wanted, not by a long shot. We will keep fighting for Medicare-for-all. But it is a step forward. Importantly, the platform also calls for an historic expansion in community health centers and the National Health Service Corps that could increase access to primary care, dental care, mental health care, and low-cost prescription drugs to as many as 25 million more Americans.• Give Medicare the ability to negotiate lower drug prices; ban pay for delay; allow Americans to get affordable drugs from Canada and other countries; and cap the amount Americans have to pay out-of-pocket every month on prescription drugs. The U.S. must no longer pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. • Fix a broken immigration system by providing a path to citizenship to 11 million aspiring Americans; build on DACA and DAPA to include the parents of DREAMers; end the inhumane and unjust raids and roundups of immigrant children and families; and ending the 3-year, 10-year, and permanent bars. We need an immigration policy that unites families and does not tear them apart.• Repair our broken criminal justice system by abolishing the death penalty; ending for-profit prisons and detention centers; banning the box; and ending racial profiling.• Strengthen the Postal Service by eliminating the disastrous pre-funding mandate that forces it to pay $5.5 billion a year for future retiree health benefits; reinstate strong overnight delivery standards; and protect 6-day mail and door-to-door delivery.• Substantially increase funding for the National Housing Trust Fund to construct and rehabilitate millions of affordable housing rental units. At a time when millions of Americans are paying 50-60 percent of their limited incomes on rent we need to make affordable housing a right of all Americans.• Make it easier to vote by establishing universal, automatic voter registration; make election day a holiday; and restore voting rights for those who've served their time.• Fix a corrupt campaign finance system by overturning Citizens United, eliminating super Pacs, and moving to public financing through a small donor matching program. Working together, we will get big money out of politics.• Make it clear that states should be allowed to decriminalize marijuana and provide certainty to legal marijuana businesses by granting them access to the same financial services as any other business.• Expand the post 9-11 veterans caregiver program to include all veterans who are in need and make sure that all veterans get the benefits that they have earned and deserve.• Close the military prison in Guantanamo Bay.• Establish a 100% clean energy system by mid-century.• Support a Justice Department investigation into fossil fuel companies like Exxon Mobil that have denied climate change.As important as these victories are, a lot more work remains to be done. Unfortunately, during the debate on the draft platform in St. Louis, we were not able to include a number of important provisions. Here are just a few.We fought to make it the policy of the Democratic Party that:• The Trans-Pacific Partnership should not receive a vote in Congress during the lame duck session and beyond. This disastrous unfettered free trade agreement would make it easier for corporations to ship jobs to low-wage countries, threaten the environment, increase the price of life-saving drugs, and reward some of the worst human rights violators in the world. It must be defeated.• We need a carbon tax. Scientists have told us that a carbon tax is the best way to make sure our planet remains habitable for our children and grandchildren and that if we do not act soon there will be more droughts, more famine, more acidification of the ocean, more rising sea levels, and more extreme weather disturbances. The Democratic Party needs to be the party of science. It is not good enough to be better than Donald Trump on the most important issue facing our planet.• We need a ban on fracking. Environmental regulators in New York have told us that no regulation, none, can make hydraulic fracturing safe. If we are serious about clean drinking water, clean air, and the future of our planet, we need a national ban on fracking.• The federal minimum wage needs to be increased to $15 an hour and indexed to inflation. While the Democratic Platform includes language calling on all workers to make at least $15 an hour, it is silent on how much the federal minimum wage should be raised. That needs to change.• Earned pension benefits must not be cut. If we do not act soon, the pension benefits of more than 1.5 million Americans in multi-employer pension plans could be cut by as much as 60 percent. When someone is promised a pension benefit we cannot allow that promise to be broken.We will be working as hard as we can to include these planks and more into the party platform in Orlando on July 8-9 when the 187-member Platform Committee meets.Now, I have heard people say what difference does all of this make? The platform, after all, is non-binding. No matter how progressive it is, there is the fear that the Democratic Party will just ignore it after the convention, bury it on a shelf to collect dust, and continue establishment politics and establishment economics as usual. Guess what? That is exactly what the establishment wants us to believe. They want us to lose hope. They want us to feel powerless. They want us to believe there is nothing we can do to prevent billionaire campaign contributors from getting virtually everything they want. But despair is not and can never be an option.Real change never happens from the top down. It always happens from the bottom up. The reality is that if we are to succeed we need a strong grassroots movement that demands that Congress and the president represent us, and not just the one percent. Just like the American Revolution was not won overnight, neither will the political revolution of 2016. It will take constant struggle against the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world.But the most exciting thing about Bernie's campaign is that it has inspired an entire generation of young Americans to take these issues on in 2016 and beyond, to get engaged in the political process, and to hold our elected leaders in government responsible for the actions they take.In other words, the political revolution of 2016 will continue. It cannot and will not fade into the night.On to Orlando."

Considering there is a language barrier, it's unusual that the number of singing teams is equal to the number of dancing teams. Participants in the singing category were all females.Participants amazed K-pop idol group IMFACT, who presented a congratulatory performance and judged for the regional round in Sikkim, with their excellent singing and accurate pronunciation. IMFACT revealed that they scratched their heads over selecting the winner between participants Adene and Priyanka until the end. Adene took the win by singing Lee Hi's 'Hold My Hand' while Priyanka won second place with Davichi's 'This Love' and Park Bom's 'You and I'.

It's the last to give up its monarchy and integrate into India in 1975. Located in the Himalayan mountains, the state is one of the best resorts in India with natural environment. Fans who came to the venue were mostly women in their 10s and 20s. However, many early teenager fans attended the event unlike last year, showing that the Korean Wave is expanding across India.A 11-year-old male student said, ""I came to know K-pop and Korean dramas through my older sister who came along together. Now I listen to K-pop almost every day.""The highlight of the event was IMFACT's congratulatory performance. The K-pop boy group sang two of their own songs before the contest, heating up the event. Upon fans' request, they sang two of BIGBANG's songs after the contest, filling the venue with excitement. As cheers of the fans continued, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to India Cho Hyun, KCCI director Kim Geum-pyeong and their wives joined the mood by standing up and clapping their hands with delight.IMFACT's vocal Lee Sang-eun said, ""This is the second time I'm visiting India, and this year is hotter than last year. I was inspired by the quality of the contest and fans' passion, and it will be a big help in preparing our second album.""The regional rounds of K-pop Contest India 2016 kicked off in NCR region on June 25, and are taking place in 7 regions including Kolkata, Bangalore, Patna, Mumbai, Chennai, and Sikkim. K-pop singer Dabit along with solo artist Hayana will be the judge for the regional rounds in Kolkata and Bangalore.

Considering there is a language barrier, it's unusual that the number of singing teams is equal to the number of dancing teams. Participants in the singing category were all females.Participants amazed K-pop idol group IMFACT, who presented a congratulatory performance and judged for the regional round in Sikkim, with their excellent singing and accurate pronunciation. IMFACT revealed that they scratched their heads over selecting the winner between participants Adene and Priyanka until the end. Adene took the win by singing Lee Hi's 'Hold My Hand' while Priyanka won second place with Davichi's 'This Love' and Park Bom's 'You and I'.

The winner of this year's northeast regional round was seven-member male team 'Dance Xenos'. Six-member female team 'Krush' won the second place. India Express reporter Anushree Majumdar, who is preparing a special report on the Korean Wave, said, ""I was very amazed by celebratory performances, contest participants, and fans' fever. The performance was in a very high quality. I also covered a NCR regional round held in KCCI in New Delhi on June 25, but this time it's so impressive that I can feel the fever.""Another reporter from a regional newspaper in Sikkim said, ""It's not easy to see a performance with such fever. It shows that the Korean Wave plays a big part of pop culture in Sikkim.""[K-pop idol group IMFACT holds a congratulatory performance during the northeast regional round of K-Pop Contest India 2016 in Sikkim on July 1./ Photographed by Ha Man-joo][K-pop idol group IMFACT judges the northeast regional round of K-Pop Contest India 2016 in Sikkim on July 1./ Photographed by Ha Man-joo] [K-pop idol group IMFACT makes hearts with their fingers after their congratulatory performance in the northeast regional round of K-Pop Contest India 2016 in Sikkim on July 1./ Photographed by Ha Man-joo] [K-pop fans shout 'I love K-pop.

It's the last to give up its monarchy and integrate into India in 1975. Located in the Himalayan mountains, the state is one of the best resorts in India with natural environment. Fans who came to the venue were mostly women in their 10s and 20s. However, many early teenager fans attended the event unlike last year, showing that the Korean Wave is expanding across India.A 11-year-old male student said, ""I came to know K-pop and Korean dramas through my older sister who came along together. Now I listen to K-pop almost every day.""The highlight of the event was IMFACT's congratulatory performance. The K-pop boy group sang two of their own songs before the contest, heating up the event. Upon fans' request, they sang two of BIGBANG's songs after the contest, filling the venue with excitement. As cheers of the fans continued, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to India Cho Hyun, KCCI director Kim Geum-pyeong and their wives joined the mood by standing up and clapping their hands with delight.IMFACT's vocal Lee Sang-eun said, ""This is the second time I'm visiting India, and this year is hotter than last year. I was inspired by the quality of the contest and fans' passion, and it will be a big help in preparing our second album.""The regional rounds of K-pop Contest India 2016 kicked off in NCR region on June 25, and are taking place in 7 regions including Kolkata, Bangalore, Patna, Mumbai, Chennai, and Sikkim. K-pop singer Dabit along with solo artist Hayana will be the judge for the regional rounds in Kolkata and Bangalore. The K-pop Contest India 2016 grand finale will be held in Chennai at Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao Concert Hall on July 30."

Here is a lecture entitled, ""What does diplomacy mean in our age?"" by Prof. Emanuel Pastreich, Senior Advisor of AsiaToday and director of The Asia Institute. This lecture was conducted for over fifty Korean diplomats engaged in the field of public diplomacy and cultural diplomacy at the Foreign Office building on June 27. [Editor's Note]When I met with Korea's Ambassador for public diplomacy Cho Hyun-dong last month we talked briefly about my current research and I met with a small group of diplomats interested in public diplomacy. Ambassador Cho made a rather unusual offer to me after our meeting. He suggested that I could come to the foreign ministry to deliver a talk on the topic.He left it up to me to write the paper, giving me the freedom to explore various themes. He also suggested that there might be an opportunity to develop it into a more complete report or monograph at a later date. I felt that this opportunity to talk with Korean diplomats about the field of diplomacy, rather than a specific topic in current affairs, was a tremendous honor, and a chance to share some of my ideas about the rapidly changing nature of diplomacy in our age. I am deeply concerned about how the nature of international relations is being so rapidly transformed by technological change that the field of diplomacy is simply not keeping up and we will be facing a serious crisis in the future when nations are rocked by forces within and without of which policy makers simply have no understanding. I spent many hours writing the talk and discussed its content with several friends in advance. The sky over Seoul was bright blue and the lecture hall on the 19th floor had a perfect view of Bukhan Mountain and the Blue House. The room was filled with over fifty Korean diplomats engaged in the field of public diplomacy and cultural diplomacy. I first discussed the impact of technology on international relations and how our assumptions about the nature of the nation state no longer applied. I then spent some time discussing the serious challenges posed by climate change and suggested that the response to climate change would increasingly dominate all aspects of diplomacy and security. What was perhaps most unusual about the talk was the amount of time that I spent talking about the Confucian tradition and the strengths of traditional Korean government. I felt strongly that Koreans are not aware of just how many precedents for good government exist in Korea's past and how much we can learn about good governance by studying past precedents from the sixteenth or seventeen centuries. I drew attention to Choi Chi-won, the great Korean diplomat of the Silla Dynasty who used culture as a mean to reinforce relations between the two countries, and was perhaps uniquely able to play a central role in policy in both countries. I closed the talk with a few remarks about the role of women in diplomacy. As I had anticipated, more than half of the diplomats in the audience were women. I told them that I had great hopes for an age in which women would play a central role in Korean diplomacy, but I also suggested that women had to create their own women's culture that moved beyond the highly commercialized femininity that is rampant in Korean society. I recommended that women needed to reinterpret the Confucian tradition to make it inclusive of women in order to assure that Korea did not lose the very best of the Confucian tradition of good governance. I hinted that only through the creative reinterpretation of Confucianism can we make it relevant to the present day, but at the same time, Korean Confucianism offered the potential of true innovation. Here is the full text of my talk: [Emanuel Pastreich, Senior Advisor of AsiaToday/ Source: AsiaToday] What does diplomacy mean in our age? ◇ The Essential Challenges  We live in an age of unprecedented change wherein the very institutions that we see around us are shifting and transforming and the very nature of international relations is evolving before our very eyes. So profound are the changes in the very nature of the economy, of society and of knowledge itself that ironically those changes are often invisible to us. We lived in a period of relative stability in Korea for the last 50 years, encountering difficulties, but being relatively certain of what needed to be done in response to each challenge. The push to develop new industries that follow the directives set in the 1960s, to work within the stable US-led framework which assumed a stable and dominant US presence, and the basic assumptions about export-driven growth, security determined by tanks and fighter planes, and shared value system within advanced nations gave great confidence to Koreans. But that age is over now and we will encounter increasing political chaos around the world, (including in places like Germany, the United States and Japan) and increasing conflicts of an unpredictable and ambiguous nature that will push us to the limits of our ability, and go beyond anything that we have encountered in our careers. In fact, the challenges are on a par to what Korea encountered at the end of the 19th century. Such a situation is brought about by several factors that are difficult to separate, but which can be identified. The first factor is the exponential rate of technological change. As IT technology becomes faster and cheaper, the processing of information is becoming easier and new technologies in all fields are emerging more quickly than humans can keep up with. Our culture, our society and our government (and corporate) institutions are being radically transformed by that change. As a result, we find that the names for things do not keep up with the nature of things. The names such as ""bank""""diplomat""""corporation"" stay the same, but the nature, the role and the purpose of those institutions are changing very dramatically. It is essential that we first assess honestly for ourselves how the world has change and come up--while we are only vaguely aware of those changes. And international relations specifically is being transformed by what Frances Cairncross has termed the ""death of distance.""New technologies are making distance an insignificant barrier to the communication and the transportation of goods, and with the advent of 3D printing, it may even be possible to transmit objects via the internet in the near future. Obviously certain decisions are made in this world by groups focused in specific places like Seoul or Washington D.C. but increasingly there is a complex network around the world that impacts that process and distance is often irrelevant to the decision-making process. The second challenge we face has to do with has to with ideological and institutional decay around the world. The assumed social contract that undergirds government and corporations, that assures that each member of society feels a responsibility as part of a community to work together with others for a common good, and to do his or her duty, have grown weak and the function of institutions has grown ambiguous. People feel that they can get away with indulging in corrupt behavior, or irresponsible short-sighted actions to a degree that they could not have done in a previous age. We keep doing what we are doing, but we start to have doubts about the purpose of our actions. Ethics and long-term planning has started to fall by the wayside and increasingly personal benefit becomes the primary purpose for networking in government and corporate institutions. Of course by the very nature of humans corrupt behavior exists in all ages, but this situation has grown much worse and those who are aware of the problem feel helpless to address it. Particularly in the case of government we find many who find (often against their own best judgment) working to represent specific interests, rather than the common good. The reasons for this shift are complex. In part the change is a result of what a good life we have lived. We have not had to fight and die for what we enjoy and therefore started to think it was something that we just get for free. We have ceased to have communities, and rather we have become just individuals who float around in society with little loyalty to each other. Also, the rapid evolution of technology has connected us together in complex ways that are at odds with the function of the institutions we work for and thus created many paradoxes. Finally, we face the tremendous challenge of climate change. Climate change is entering a decisive stage at which it will cease to be a slight inconvenience and become rather a life-and-death struggle for survival. We will have to reinvent our institutions, redirect our technology, and rethink our assumptions about the purpose of government and the nature of our economy in response to this overwhelming threat. The change will be profound, and the country which is best able to make this transition will be at an advantage. Korea has been lagging behind other countries in the adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change. But that must change now. Korea has the potential to move faster than other countries, but sadly we have lacked the decisiveness and bravery to do so. ◇ The Korean visionThere has been a tremendous cultural boom around the world known as the ""Korean Wave"" and youth everywhere are drawn to the vitality of Korean music and film. Koreans have patted themselves on the back for this achievement, boasting that Americans now like ""Gangnam Style."" But this form of influence through popular culture, if it lacks any ethical content, anything that inspires people to strive for something greater, will be quite limited in its impact. The real challenge going forward will whether Korea can develop and articulate its own vision for what the world should be and how the we can work together to address massive issues like climate change and adaptation to technological evolution. The increasing political chaos in the United States means that there will no longer be a clear guiding light to be found in Washington D.C. Koreans must first work together in small groups of dedicated individuals to come up with an agenda and then work with like-minded people around the world to implement that agenda. We must make the proposal, not just respond to someone else's proposal. This agenda obviously must be concerned with Korea's own interests, but from now on it must also put considerable emphasis on common goals for the entire Earth and promote an inspiring vision of what is possible even in the midst of considerable chaos. The Korean vision for the world, the ""Korean dream"" for our age, is a new concept for Korean diplomats. It represents a radical change in Korean diplomacy. More often than not Koreans have assumed that they should model themselves on institutions like Brookings or CSIS, take notes on how advanced nations do things. But I am sorry to tell you that those institutions are not working that well these days. Koreans will need to create their own institutions and their own vision. Where do we start and we try to create a new vision and approach to diplomacy? Ironically, although we are talking about a new diplomacy in response to unprecedented changes, the answer can be found not in the future, but in the past. We first need to transform institutions, and to regain confidence in what we do and our ability to make a better world. Korea's past offers an answer to this challenge.We may not think of issues like the transformation of the nation state by globalization as a topic for diplomats to contemplate, but it is the issue for our time and we need to start talking about it. The same is true for the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. Koreans should not be afraid to start addressing this ethical issue. We should embrace it as part of the global agenda and speak honestly. We will gain much respect for doing so. Korea has a tremendous tradition of public service by intellectuals through the civil service system. Korea has many precedents for good government, for bringing in talent and assuring institutional reform that are not imported from abroad but indigenous. Although we often learn about that civil service system in a negative in light because of its corrupt form in the late Chosun, in fact it was one of the most effective systems for governance. I would suggest that the best way to advance out of a current corrupt political culture in which politicians chase after money and symbols of authority, is to restore a strong civil service system. It does not solve all problems, but it can give the ship of state a real compass. Real change in diplomacy can start with just a small group. This group here is more than enough people to create a new culture of excellence. First we must return to our much maligned Confucian roots. The public servant is not just a stable job. The public servant is an intellectual who is morally committed to contribute to the public good. The task is not easy, but it is of the highest value and should receive the highest respect. We may be discouraged that we do not find great leaders around us and so we seek out leaders in rather imperfect politicians in our age. But in fact we can find great leaders to show us the way and regain the great tradition of diplomacy and good government in our own past who can inspire us to innovate and evolve, not in imitation of Western institutions, but rather in the creation of new interpretations of our own past achievements. This opportunity is critical when it comes to diplomacy. We have heroic figures like Choi Chi-won, who played a tremendous role in Silla's relations with China, and in the development of a culture of excellence within the Tang dynasty bureaucracy. We do not need to have Choi Chiwon with us now in order to learn from him. You need to be aware that you inherit a great tradition and you can be inspired by it, but also that you have a responsibility to uphold it. There many other examples of extremely innovative approaches to diplomacy that can be found in Goguryo, Goryo and Chosun in response to complex geopolitical shifts in the Song period, during the Mongol occupation, and the Ming-Qing translation. We can find inspiration in those efforts, and also we can find practical examples of diplomatic solutions in that past that will give us hint about where we should go. We should all become intellectuals, not to write articles and teach, but to come up with real solutions among ourselves. Korea has a tremendous tradition in which scholars were committed to learning as an ethical activity and at the same time, that public officials were intellectuals who not only read broadly, discussed the ethical implications of their actions and their policies, but also who were engaged directly in the formulation of policy. They did not farm out policy to consulting firms or to think tanks, but rather they had the self-confidence to undertake such activities themselves. We need a new generation of diplomats who become specialists in certain regions, even specific parts of countries like China or India. We need them to develop their own ideas and have the time to read books and discuss new concepts together as part of a process of learning for a lifetime. That is the great Korean tradition. We need, in that context, to stop outsourcing the discussion of policy and strategy to think tanks or consultants, and rather develop our competency internally. ◇ We need a strong government  Strong government does not mean a government that can do whatever it wants and oppress the people. Strong government means government that is firmly based in ethical principles and that can limit the abuse of power by corporations, by the rich, by multinational interest groups, establish a long-term plan for the nation and work together with multiple parties to realize that plan. A strong government can over-come the short-term vision of individuals and establish a common goal for the nation. Leaders like King Sejong have already established precedents for such government. We need to start taking those reforms as a blueprint for what we should do, rather than relying on the writings of international think tanks which are increasingly driven by the mere pursuit of profit. The government itself can create think tanks, expertise, and reliable information. If the commercial media does not do its job, government is entirely capable of creating more reliable and trustworthy media. The problem is not media, it is the commitment of you to ethical principles and your ability to be creative, and unrelenting, in developing solutions. But strong government is meaningless without the intellectual who is committed to society and expresses his or her will through government service. Remember what Confucius wrote: 君子不器This phrase has several different meanings. The first interpretation is that the intellectual should not be too much of a specialist, that his or her concern should be for ethical and cultural issues, and he or she should not just be a technical specialist working on immediate problems of a technical matter. But this phrase also has the meaning of ""the intellectual is not a tool."" That is to say that the intellectual, serving in government, must play by the rules and follow directives from above, but he or she is ultimately not a tool to be used by powerful interests, but rather the intellectual has his or her ethical stance and contributes through his or her support of good policy and or his or her resistance to unethical activities.Here is the critical question: how can we, through our smallest daily actions, create a new culture, a culture that transforms our society, and global society, in a manner that money or power can never do? This problem is exactly the one that the great Confucian scholars of Korea and China struggled with for centuries and they figured out how, through the power of culture, of habits, of commitment to art and literature that has true ethical content. Those scholar officials were able to create a culture and through that culture create real, long-term positive change. Powerful people could abuse power, seize control, but they would inevitably be brought back into the fold by these generations of scholar officials. That tradition in Korea has been sleeping for the last 80 years as we tend to embrace the myth of rapid industrialization, but that Confucian tradition is the best part of Korea and it is just waiting for us to bring it back to life. Once we can engage and revive the tradition of good governance in Korea, and reinterpret that tradition to apply to the current conditions through a creative process, we can inspire people to go beyond just following orders. That transformation of government can stretch around the world and we will find those with moderate ideas about politics, but a strong commitment to ethical principles in many countries who are ready to join with us in this effort to create a new form of diplomacy which is about intellectual engagement, about ethics and also about breaking out of the current cages we find ourselves in the sad diplomacy of superficial rituals. Let us go back to Mencius for an insight into what the role of the public servant, both scholar and government official holding up high ethical values, can be in countering the undue influence of wealth and power. Mencius writes that: ""you will not be corrupted by wealth or status You will not be moved away from your goal by poverty or the lowliness of your position You will not yield to threats of authority or force""富贵不能淫 贫贱不能移 威武不能屈I do not think Mencius meant that you never compromise in any case. Of course we must compromise, and sometimes compromise with wealth and power. The point is rather that we should set a standard that can inspire all of you to stand up for what is right, even in the face over overwhelming arguments for the failed or dangerous short-term approaches. ◇ The role of womenLet me conclude with a few words about the role of women in our society. I see that there are many women here and that increasingly women are playing an important role in diplomacy in Korea at every level. They are increasingly the language experts, the international relations experts. We welcome women to play this critical role in Korean diplomacy and we look forward to an age in which the minister of foreign affairs is a woman and women play critical roles in diplomacy, defense and intelligence. There are, however, some important conditions in order for the new role of women to be a success. On the one hand, we need to create an environment in which all offices of the foreign ministry and all embassies and consulates have free child care centers where women can leave their children when the work, and then watch their children via video from the office. We need a flexible system wherein women can work at home, or take off a year or two without it impacting their careers. In other words we need to recognize that in the long-term being a mother may well be the best training for being a diplomat and that the health of families is crucial.At the same time, women need to raise their expectations for themselves. The Confucian tradition, which is the basis of Korean bureaucratic culture, is biased against women. It is also what makes Korea great. We can and we must reinterpret that tradition so as to make it relevant to women. When women, girls, think about their models, their heroes, they should not think only about pop singers, actresses and models, but should consider the tradition of great government officials and scholars, from King Sejong to the scholar Dasan to be their heroes and their models. That Confucian tradition does not belong to men any more. It belongs to all Koreans, and especially to women.Women must be serious. They must devote themselves to their work and to learning about the fields that they will practice in depth. They must be extremely professional. They should not stop being women, or give up femininity, in order to be diplomats. But at the same time they must be firm, confident and capable of expressing themselves in a convincing manner in all circumstances. Sadly, Korea is now swept by a wave of feminine consumerism that threatens to make all women waste their time thinking about clothes, make up, and drinking café latte at fashionable cafes. It is essential that the women who play the key role in diplomacy create their own culture, one based on the best of the Korean tradition, informed by the Western tradition, and focused on the true challenges of our age. They must be brave and reject this dangerous consumer culture.I do not believe that the culture for women that I describe exists yet, but I think that you can create such a culture, and that the degree to which you do so will determine Korea's future success.◇ ConclusionI have spoken about a variety of topics, some of which may not seem directly related with each other, although I believe that they are. Perhaps I can make a suggestion as to what your response should be to these words. Obviously, if these words do not speak to you, you have no obligation to do anything. But if you think you detect some fragment of truth in what I have said, I hope that you will spend a bit of time thinking about these points. These are words that are aimed at changing a culture. They are not words for the sake of words, but words for the sake of action. We need to change our habits and culture, as much as changing any particular policy. We need to have a sense of crisis, for the challenges that Korea, and the world, face today, are extremely serious. We need to think about what we will do and we should not be afraid to talk with each other about what we need to do over lunch, and over coffee. It is no longer acceptable to think that difficult problems should be avoided so as not to spoil the mood. At the same time, we need to be positive in our approach, to feel that what we do is meaningful and that what we can make a contribution. It is the combination of both a sense of crisis with a sense of optimism that can lead to true institutional change. Korea has everything it needs to be the global leader and in many respects it is already the world's leader in diplomacy. The challenge is to combine Korean knowhow and Korean technology and resources with a moral clarity, an ethical commitment."

Such a situation is brought about by several factors that are difficult to separate, but which can be identified. The first factor is the exponential rate of technological change. As IT technology becomes faster and cheaper, the processing of information is becoming easier and new technologies in all fields are emerging more quickly than humans can keep up with. Our culture, our society and our government (and corporate) institutions are being radically transformed by that change. As a result, we find that the names for things do not keep up with the nature of things. The names such as ""bank""""diplomat""""corporation"" stay the same, but the nature, the role and the purpose of those institutions are changing very dramatically. It is essential that we first assess honestly for ourselves how the world has change and come up--while we are only vaguely aware of those changes. And international relations specifically is being transformed by what Frances Cairncross has termed the ""death of distance.""New technologies are making distance an insignificant barrier to the communication and the transportation of goods, and with the advent of 3D printing, it may even be possible to transmit objects via the internet in the near future. Obviously certain decisions are made in this world by groups focused in specific places like Seoul or Washington D.C. but increasingly there is a complex network around the world that impacts that process and distance is often irrelevant to the decision-making process. The second challenge we face has to do with has to with ideological and institutional decay around the world. The assumed social contract that undergirds government and corporations, that assures that each member of society feels a responsibility as part of a community to work together with others for a common good, and to do his or her duty, have grown weak and the function of institutions has grown ambiguous. People feel that they can get away with indulging in corrupt behavior, or irresponsible short-sighted actions to a degree that they could not have done in a previous age. We keep doing what we are doing, but we start to have doubts about the purpose of our actions. Ethics and long-term planning has started to fall by the wayside and increasingly personal benefit becomes the primary purpose for networking in government and corporate institutions. Of course by the very nature of humans corrupt behavior exists in all ages, but this situation has grown much worse and those who are aware of the problem feel helpless to address it. Particularly in the case of government we find many who find (often against their own best judgment) working to represent specific interests, rather than the common good. The reasons for this shift are complex. In part the change is a result of what a good life we have lived. We have not had to fight and die for what we enjoy and therefore started to think it was something that we just get for free. We have ceased to have communities, and rather we have become just individuals who float around in society with little loyalty to each other. Also, the rapid evolution of technology has connected us together in complex ways that are at odds with the function of the institutions we work for and thus created many paradoxes. Finally, we face the tremendous challenge of climate change. Climate change is entering a decisive stage at which it will cease to be a slight inconvenience and become rather a life-and-death struggle for survival. We will have to reinvent our institutions, redirect our technology, and rethink our assumptions about the purpose of government and the nature of our economy in response to this overwhelming threat. The change will be profound, and the country which is best able to make this transition will be at an advantage. Korea has been lagging behind other countries in the adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change. But that must change now. Korea has the potential to move faster than other countries, but sadly we have lacked the decisiveness and bravery to do so. ◇ The Korean visionThere has been a tremendous cultural boom around the world known as the ""Korean Wave"" and youth everywhere are drawn to the vitality of Korean music and film. Koreans have patted themselves on the back for this achievement, boasting that Americans now like ""Gangnam Style."" But this form of influence through popular culture, if it lacks any ethical content, anything that inspires people to strive for something greater, will be quite limited in its impact. The real challenge going forward will whether Korea can develop and articulate its own vision for what the world should be and how the we can work together to address massive issues like climate change and adaptation to technological evolution. The increasing political chaos in the United States means that there will no longer be a clear guiding light to be found in Washington D.C. Koreans must first work together in small groups of dedicated individuals to come up with an agenda and then work with like-minded people around the world to implement that agenda. We must make the proposal, not just respond to someone else's proposal. This agenda obviously must be concerned with Korea's own interests, but from now on it must also put considerable emphasis on common goals for the entire Earth and promote an inspiring vision of what is possible even in the midst of considerable chaos. The Korean vision for the world, the ""Korean dream"" for our age, is a new concept for Korean diplomats. It represents a radical change in Korean diplomacy. More often than not Koreans have assumed that they should model themselves on institutions like Brookings or CSIS, take notes on how advanced nations do things. But I am sorry to tell you that those institutions are not working that well these days. Koreans will need to create their own institutions and their own vision. Where do we start and we try to create a new vision and approach to diplomacy? Ironically, although we are talking about a new diplomacy in response to unprecedented changes, the answer can be found not in the future, but in the past. We first need to transform institutions, and to regain confidence in what we do and our ability to make a better world. Korea's past offers an answer to this challenge.We may not think of issues like the transformation of the nation state by globalization as a topic for diplomats to contemplate, but it is the issue for our time and we need to start talking about it. The same is true for the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. Koreans should not be afraid to start addressing this ethical issue. We should embrace it as part of the global agenda and speak honestly. We will gain much respect for doing so. Korea has a tremendous tradition of public service by intellectuals through the civil service system. Korea has many precedents for good government, for bringing in talent and assuring institutional reform that are not imported from abroad but indigenous. Although we often learn about that civil service system in a negative in light because of its corrupt form in the late Chosun, in fact it was one of the most effective systems for governance. I would suggest that the best way to advance out of a current corrupt political culture in which politicians chase after money and symbols of authority, is to restore a strong civil service system. It does not solve all problems, but it can give the ship of state a real compass. Real change in diplomacy can start with just a small group. This group here is more than enough people to create a new culture of excellence. First we must return to our much maligned Confucian roots. The public servant is not just a stable job. The public servant is an intellectual who is morally committed to contribute to the public good. The task is not easy, but it is of the highest value and should receive the highest respect. We may be discouraged that we do not find great leaders around us and so we seek out leaders in rather imperfect politicians in our age. But in fact we can find great leaders to show us the way and regain the great tradition of diplomacy and good government in our own past who can inspire us to innovate and evolve, not in imitation of Western institutions, but rather in the creation of new interpretations of our own past achievements. This opportunity is critical when it comes to diplomacy. We have heroic figures like Choi Chi-won, who played a tremendous role in Silla's relations with China, and in the development of a culture of excellence within the Tang dynasty bureaucracy. We do not need to have Choi Chiwon with us now in order to learn from him. You need to be aware that you inherit a great tradition and you can be inspired by it, but also that you have a responsibility to uphold it. There many other examples of extremely innovative approaches to diplomacy that can be found in Goguryo, Goryo and Chosun in response to complex geopolitical shifts in the Song period, during the Mongol occupation, and the Ming-Qing translation. We can find inspiration in those efforts, and also we can find practical examples of diplomatic solutions in that past that will give us hint about where we should go. We should all become intellectuals, not to write articles and teach, but to come up with real solutions among ourselves. Korea has a tremendous tradition in which scholars were committed to learning as an ethical activity and at the same time, that public officials were intellectuals who not only read broadly, discussed the ethical implications of their actions and their policies, but also who were engaged directly in the formulation of policy. They did not farm out policy to consulting firms or to think tanks, but rather they had the self-confidence to undertake such activities themselves. We need a new generation of diplomats who become specialists in certain regions, even specific parts of countries like China or India. We need them to develop their own ideas and have the time to read books and discuss new concepts together as part of a process of learning for a lifetime. That is the great Korean tradition. We need, in that context, to stop outsourcing the discussion of policy and strategy to think tanks or consultants, and rather develop our competency internally. ◇ We need a strong government  Strong government does not mean a government that can do whatever it wants and oppress the people. Strong government means government that is firmly based in ethical principles and that can limit the abuse of power by corporations, by the rich, by multinational interest groups, establish a long-term plan for the nation and work together with multiple parties to realize that plan. A strong government can over-come the short-term vision of individuals and establish a common goal for the nation. Leaders like King Sejong have already established precedents for such government. We need to start taking those reforms as a blueprint for what we should do, rather than relying on the writings of international think tanks which are increasingly driven by the mere pursuit of profit. The government itself can create think tanks, expertise, and reliable information. If the commercial media does not do its job, government is entirely capable of creating more reliable and trustworthy media. The problem is not media, it is the commitment of you to ethical principles and your ability to be creative, and unrelenting, in developing solutions. But strong government is meaningless without the intellectual who is committed to society and expresses his or her will through government service. Remember what Confucius wrote: 君子不器This phrase has several different meanings. The first interpretation is that the intellectual should not be too much of a specialist, that his or her concern should be for ethical and cultural issues, and he or she should not just be a technical specialist working on immediate problems of a technical matter. But this phrase also has the meaning of ""the intellectual is not a tool."" That is to say that the intellectual, serving in government, must play by the rules and follow directives from above, but he or she is ultimately not a tool to be used by powerful interests, but rather the intellectual has his or her ethical stance and contributes through his or her support of good policy and or his or her resistance to unethical activities.Here is the critical question: how can we, through our smallest daily actions, create a new culture, a culture that transforms our society, and global society, in a manner that money or power can never do? This problem is exactly the one that the great Confucian scholars of Korea and China struggled with for centuries and they figured out how, through the power of culture, of habits, of commitment to art and literature that has true ethical content. Those scholar officials were able to create a culture and through that culture create real, long-term positive change. Powerful people could abuse power, seize control, but they would inevitably be brought back into the fold by these generations of scholar officials. That tradition in Korea has been sleeping for the last 80 years as we tend to embrace the myth of rapid industrialization, but that Confucian tradition is the best part of Korea and it is just waiting for us to bring it back to life. Once we can engage and revive the tradition of good governance in Korea, and reinterpret that tradition to apply to the current conditions through a creative process, we can inspire people to go beyond just following orders. That transformation of government can stretch around the world and we will find those with moderate ideas about politics, but a strong commitment to ethical principles in many countries who are ready to join with us in this effort to create a new form of diplomacy which is about intellectual engagement, about ethics and also about breaking out of the current cages we find ourselves in the sad diplomacy of superficial rituals. Let us go back to Mencius for an insight into what the role of the public servant, both scholar and government official holding up high ethical values, can be in countering the undue influence of wealth and power. Mencius writes that: ""you will not be corrupted by wealth or status You will not be moved away from your goal by poverty or the lowliness of your position You will not yield to threats of authority or force""富贵不能淫 贫贱不能移 威武不能屈I do not think Mencius meant that you never compromise in any case. Of course we must compromise, and sometimes compromise with wealth and power. The point is rather that we should set a standard that can inspire all of you to stand up for what is right, even in the face over overwhelming arguments for the failed or dangerous short-term approaches. ◇ The role of womenLet me conclude with a few words about the role of women in our society. I see that there are many women here and that increasingly women are playing an important role in diplomacy in Korea at every level. They are increasingly the language experts, the international relations experts. We welcome women to play this critical role in Korean diplomacy and we look forward to an age in which the minister of foreign affairs is a woman and women play critical roles in diplomacy, defense and intelligence. There are, however, some important conditions in order for the new role of women to be a success. On the one hand, we need to create an environment in which all offices of the foreign ministry and all embassies and consulates have free child care centers where women can leave their children when the work, and then watch their children via video from the office. We need a flexible system wherein women can work at home, or take off a year or two without it impacting their careers. In other words we need to recognize that in the long-term being a mother may well be the best training for being a diplomat and that the health of families is crucial.At the same time, women need to raise their expectations for themselves. The Confucian tradition, which is the basis of Korean bureaucratic culture, is biased against women. It is also what makes Korea great. We can and we must reinterpret that tradition so as to make it relevant to women. When women, girls, think about their models, their heroes, they should not think only about pop singers, actresses and models, but should consider the tradition of great government officials and scholars, from King Sejong to the scholar Dasan to be their heroes and their models. That Confucian tradition does not belong to men any more. It belongs to all Koreans, and especially to women.Women must be serious. They must devote themselves to their work and to learning about the fields that they will practice in depth. They must be extremely professional. They should not stop being women, or give up femininity, in order to be diplomats. But at the same time they must be firm, confident and capable of expressing themselves in a convincing manner in all circumstances. Sadly, Korea is now swept by a wave of feminine consumerism that threatens to make all women waste their time thinking about clothes, make up, and drinking café latte at fashionable cafes. It is essential that the women who play the key role in diplomacy create their own culture, one based on the best of the Korean tradition, informed by the Western tradition, and focused on the true challenges of our age. They must be brave and reject this dangerous consumer culture.I do not believe that the culture for women that I describe exists yet, but I think that you can create such a culture, and that the degree to which you do so will determine Korea's future success.◇ ConclusionI have spoken about a variety of topics, some of which may not seem directly related with each other, although I believe that they are. Perhaps I can make a suggestion as to what your response should be to these words. Obviously, if these words do not speak to you, you have no obligation to do anything. But if you think you detect some fragment of truth in what I have said, I hope that you will spend a bit of time thinking about these points. These are words that are aimed at changing a culture. They are not words for the sake of words, but words for the sake of action. We need to change our habits and culture, as much as changing any particular policy. We need to have a sense of crisis, for the challenges that Korea, and the world, face today, are extremely serious. We need to think about what we will do and we should not be afraid to talk with each other about what we need to do over lunch, and over coffee. It is no longer acceptable to think that difficult problems should be avoided so as not to spoil the mood. At the same time, we need to be positive in our approach, to feel that what we do is meaningful and that what we can make a contribution. It is the combination of both a sense of crisis with a sense of optimism that can lead to true institutional change. Korea has everything it needs to be the global leader and in many respects it is already the world's leader in diplomacy. The challenge is to combine Korean knowhow and Korean technology and resources with a moral clarity, an ethical commitment."

She said there was no camera found, mounted on the dash or of any kind, in the wreckage.A lawyer for a truck driver involved in the accident with the Tesla told Reuters his investigators had spoken to a witness who said the DVD player was playing a ""Harry Potter"" video after the accident, but the lawyer was unable to verify that beyond the witness account.""As to the video, there was a witness who came to the scene immediately after the accident occurred, and we can't verify it at this point,"" said Paul Weekley of Tampa, the lawyer for the truck driver. ""But what we have been told is that he saw a Harry Potter video still playing when he got to the scene.”Lawyers for the family of the victim, 40-year-old Joshua Brown, released a statement Friday saying the family is cooperating with the investigations ""and hopes that information learned from this tragedy will trigger further innovation which enhances the safety of everyone on the roadways.""The statement describes the accident as having been ""caused by a semi tractor-trailer which crossed a divided highway and caused the fatal collision with Josh's Tesla.""The questions surrounding why the 2015 Model S Brown was driving did not stop for the truck, and whether Brown was watching the road at the time are critical for Tesla Motors Inc.

Here's how one of America's poorest school districts is trying to find a solution.",2016-07-02,Seventy percent of Franklin Elementary School’s kindergarten class qualifies for language services because they do not speak English fluently. More than 70 languages are represented across the district.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577735ec1800002500fa3a48.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- When Dadhi Dahal first came to the United States in early 2009, the Bhutanese population in Syracuse, New York was quite small — the first refugees from Bhutan, fleeing ethnic cleansing policies in their home country, arrived in 2008, after they had spent years in refugee camps in Nepal.Fast forward eight years. The Bhutanese population has grown into a flourishing, tightly knit group of about 3,000 people. They are part of a substantial refugee population from South Asia, Africa and the Middle East that has transformed the city and its schools. Students in the Syracuse City School District speak more than 70 different languages and four of the most common among them are Nepali, Karen, Somali, and Arabic.In 2010, to better serve this population, the Syracuse City school District created a new position — nationality workers — to serve as a bridge between new immigrant communities and the schools. Dahal is one of them, and a big part of his job is interpretation. He helps immigrant parents communicate with English-speaking teachers and district officials and ensures that parents have an opportunity to be heard.The district, one of the poorest in the country, works hard to maintain open channels of communication with parents — because it’s important to student success, and because it’s the law. A failure to communicate effectively with immigrant parents is a violation of their civil rights, considered discrimination based on national origin, which is prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Without language services, non-English-speaking parents are considered to be blocked from equal access to school information and resources.As refugees spread out across the U.S., settling in the Southeast, Midwest, and many rural areas that, before, were fairly insulated from large immigrant populations, schools are being forced to adapt to a new reality. Syracuse is one of the more proactive districts when it comes to providing language access. While it struggles, at times, to meet its obligations, districts in other cities and states have fared worse. Dozens have been investigated by the Office of Civil Rights or the Department of Justice in recent years following complaints that they did not provide interpreters or translated materials to parents who needed them. These schools are in Yuma, Arizona; New Orleans, Louisiana; Richmond, Virginia; Detroit, Michigan; Modesto, California; and Seattle, Washington, among others.“Providing an interpreter is a fundamental responsibility of a district when they have children or parents who do not speak English,” said Roger Rosenthal, executive director of the Migrant Legal Action Program in Washington, D.C.Rosenthal has been advocating on behalf of immigrant families for more than 30 years, and he has been glad to see the Obama administration turn up the pressure on districts that don’t meet their obligations to them.The legal rationale for language access requirements has existed for decades, but the Obama administration has been more aggressive than others in holding schools accountable. While the Civil Rights Act doesn’t specifically require schools to offer interpretation and translation services to parents — or any special supports for their non-English-speaking children – it bars discrimination based on national origin in any program or activity receiving federal dollars. The courts have consistently relied on this rationale to require schools to provide these services, and a “Dear Colleague” letter from the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Justice in 2015 went into explicit detail about what schools have to do to communicate with immigrant parents. The letter says that schools must have a process in place to identify parents who need language assistance and assign the resources to provide it. They must ensure interpreters and translators are trained in their roles and understand the ethics and confidentiality requirements involved. And their services must be offered for free by competent staff members or contracted individuals.Related: English one day, Español the next: Dual-language learning expands with a South Bronx school as a model At a recent daylong event for parents in Syracuse, two English-speaking teacher-facilitators introduced immigrant parents to the intricacies of U.S. schools, including the practice of holding parent-teacher conferences.“Teachers like this,” said Kristina Crehan, one of the facilitators. “They want to know more about the student and learn from you.”After Crehan said a sentence or two, a Karenni interpreter repeated what she said to a cluster of five parents from Myanmar and a Somali interpreter repeated the same to his group of eight. The Somali interpreter, Abdullahi Ibrahim, is another nationality worker, while Sah Poe Wah is a contract interpreter Syracuse found through Interfaith Works of Central New York.This year the district’s interpreters have been busier than ever, helping schools meet new parent meeting requirements handed down from the state. Schools are now required to hold annual meetings with parents of English language learners to discuss their children’s language progress and their academic achievement more generally. It is not enough to get these immigrant parents to school events; teachers need to have one-on-one meetings that are documented and tracked in each student’s file. Jacqueline LeRoy, who is responsible for coordinating the district’s language access services, said meeting the new requirement has been a challenge.“When you think about the numbers of students, and we have this huge language barrier, and there are these cultural differences,” LeRoy said. “Some parents aren’t familiar with a parent-teacher conference. … It’s a new type of thinking about the educational system.”Related: In a conservative corner of Arkansas, schools welcome immigrantsSometimes cultural differences keep parents from understanding that schools want to hear from them. But there are other times when parents who want to be their children’s advocates — or simply be well-informed about their children’s progress — are kept from doing so because of language barriers.Rita Pin Ahrens is the director of education policy at the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center in Washington, D.C. The organization has supported partner groups that have filed complaints with the Office of Civil Rights when schools and districts do not provide the language access services they should.During the 2014-15 fiscal year, the Office of Civil Rights received 82 complaints alleging discrimination against English language learners or their parents. And national experts believe compliance problems are far more widespread.“It’s very challenging for immigrants, and refugees especially, because a lot of them just don’t understand the process for how you would file complaints, or that you even have a right to file complaints,” Ahrens said. These parents do not understand their rights or the responsibilities of school districts. And even worse, school and district administrators often do not, themselves, understand their legal obligations to parents who don’t speak English. “There’s that lack of clarity all around,” Ahrens said.Last year’s “Dear Colleague” letter may help clear things up for many schools, but understanding is only the first step in building a functional infrastructure to adequately serve immigrant parents. In New York City, the country’s biggest school district, more than 90 languages are represented across more than 1,800 public schools. And immigrant parents who speak even the most common languages argue they can’t get the services they’re entitled to.Related: Say it in any language you want – Latinos need a voice in the U.S. education debateEdith Rodriguez is such a parent. She moved to the United States from Mexico about 10 years ago and now lives in Queens. She has a 10-year-old daughter named Leilany who has been receiving services for her special needs since she was an infant. Leilany’s special education classification by the New York City Department of Education is that she is intellectually disabled. She receives physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy, among other supports. Schools are required to create individualized education programs (IEPs) for all students with disabilities and hold annual meetings with parents to go over their child’s plans. Rodriguez is among the parents named in a 2012 complaint against the New York City Department of Education alleging systemic denial of language services to parents of children with special needs who do not speak English fluently.“In addition to explicit provisions regarding language access, every major law that impacts the education of children with disabilities foregrounds the primary role of the parent in developing and implementing his or her child’s education plan,” the complaint reads. “There is an inextricable link between the ability to participate and the ability to communicate; without language services, parent rights involving consent and due process are rendered meaningless.”On top of state and federal regulations, New York City has its own strong protections for language access. But interpreters provided at Rodriguez’s meetings allegedly violated basic language access requirements outlined in court cases and federal guidance.In a recent interview in Spanish, Rodriguez said bilingual school personnel have been pulled into meetings to interpret for her, but she said they did not know how to explain specialized terms relating to special education services. She also has had confidentiality concerns with teachers being asked to participate in highly personal conversations about her daughter.When it comes to the actual interpretation, Rodriguez said her interpreters have refused to repeat her questions in English to the whole group, and she says she has received summarized statements by other meeting participants instead of word-for-word interpretation.“I feel like I can’t get involved like I want to to help my daughter,” Rodriguez said. “It’s very difficult. Sometimes it wears me out because I feel powerless.”The 2012 complaint is still unresolved, and Rodriguez says she has begun to have the same problems advocating for her five-year-old son, who entered kindergarten this year and receives speech therapy. While Kleber Palma, director of the New York City Department of Education’s translation and interpretation unit, cannot comment on the pending investigation, he said the district is working to improve its language access infrastructure. Schools now have direct access to over-the-phone interpreters, allowing them, for the first time, to use the service outside of regular business hours. Principals were instructed to designate a language access coordinator to make sure their schools comply with city, state, and federal policies. And a language access complaint line launched to give parents an opportunity to file their grievances.The New York City Department of Education is also hiring nine full-time language access support coordinators whose only responsibilities will be to make sure language access issues are addressed at the school level, according to Palma. And in the fall, the Department of Education plans to kick off an awareness campaign to help parents understand their rights and learn how to access services.“The intent is that our infrastructure within the Department of Education is in place and that everybody is aware of what the responsibility is,” Palma said.Abja Midha is a project director with Advocates for Children of New York, one of two organizations that filed the complaint against the New York City Department of Education. Midha says there is still a disconnect between policy and practice. Few parents know about the language access complaint line, and even some who file complaints do not have their problems resolved. And, Midha says, staff at many schools still do not know the coordinators exist as a resource to help manage language assistance.“It really does deny the parent the ability to exercise their right to participate in their child’s education,” Midha said.Research shows students lose when parent engagement is low, and that’s bad for schools. What’s more, districts risk losing all federal funding for failing to comply with the Civil Rights Act. But this has never happened. Instead, districts under investigation have all agreed to update their practices to meet federal expectations.Rosenthal, of the Migrant Legal Action Program in D.C., says failing to provide interpretation services is as much a civil rights violation as discrimination based on race. But enforcement comes and goes with political will. After President Clinton left office, the George W. Bush administration took down a variety of language access resources from the Office of Civil Rights website. In the past seven years, Obama’s team has swung the pendulum back in the other direction. Now, with a contentious presidential campaign under way, it is an open question whether language access will be taken seriously at a time when the nation’s schools are serving a growing population of English language learners and their parents.But at Franklin Elementary School in Syracuse, educators don’t see a choice. Seventy percent of kindergartners qualify for language services because they don’t speak English fluently. In recent years a normal percentage for the school has been closer to 28, according to Principal Katrina Allen. “We’ve never had an incoming class with a population that large,” Allen said. And that number doesn’t include the children who speak English even though their parents don’t.She plans to hire more teachers who are certified to teach speakers of other languages, but she expects it to take at least a couple years to find enough with the proper qualifications. In the meantime, she’ll rely on the district’s supports – including nationality workers -- to reach their parents.This story was written by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news website focused on inequality and innovation in education.

38,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Heads To Atlantic City To Cash In On Donald Trump's Failures,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-atlantic-city_us_57772742e4b09b4c43c09623,She will highlight his string of bankruptcies to argue that he's unfit to be president.,2016-07-02,"In 1991, Donald Trump and his then-girlfiend Marla Maples attended the Holyfield-Foreman fight at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, N.J.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_208_2998_1870%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton will be going after Donald Trump as a shady and selfish businessman next week in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the site of his failed casino empire. On Wednesday, Clinton will ""make the case that Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to serve as president, based on the wake of destruction his business dealings caused in the seaside town and for businesses and families across the country,"" according to a campaign official.""The trip will highlight that Clinton is committed to building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, while Donald Trump has spent his life fighting for himself at the expense of everyone else,"" the official added.The campaign stop will also allow Clinton to go after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.), even indirectly, since he has emerged as one of the top vice presidential picks for Trump.Trump did well in Atlantic City. He has said the money he made there was ""incredible."" But others who dealt with him weren't so lucky. Indeed, as The New York Times has reported, ""He put up little of his own money, shifted personal debts to the casinos and collected millions of dollars in salary, bonuses and other payments.""When Trump filed for bankruptcy for four of his Atlantic City casinos, he left many small businesses and contractors struggling in his wake. One woman told The New York Times that it took her father three years to get the money Trump owed him for the work he did on the Taj Mahal casino. His business nearly went into bankruptcy, and he received only 30 cents on the dollar. ""Trump crawled his way to the top on the back of little guys, one of them being my father,"" said Beth Rosser, who took over her father's business. ""He had no regard for thousands of men and women who worked on those projects. He says he'll make America great again, but his past shows the complete opposite of that."" That message is exactly what Clinton will try to get across on Wednesday. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee will argue that what Trump did in Atlantic City followed a familiar pattern: He restructured his debts and padded his own pockets, while investors, contractors and other working people were left holding the bag. Trump has stopped talking about another one of his failed ventures -- Trump University, a for-profit college that former employees have described as a ""fraudulent scheme"" that ""preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money.""After U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel ordered the release of embarrassing internal documents related to the venture in May, Trump went after the Indiana-born judge as ""Mexican"" and said he was unable to be impartial because of his ethnicity. The racist attacks angered not only his usual critics, but many members of his own party. Trump initially refused to back down, but eventually said he would no longer be talking about the judge or the lawsuits around Trump University. "
