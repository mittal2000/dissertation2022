Chef, food and wine writer, photographer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wild-mushroom-confit-with_us_5b9db5b4e4b03a1dcc8bcf05,"So delicious, deep and aromatic, you might want to eat the whole batch in one go.",2013-12-12,2013-12-10-IMG_9569Wildmushroomconfitwithgarlicandfreshherbs.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-12-10-IMG_9569Wildmushroomconfitwithgarlicandfreshherbs-thumb.jpg,"Wild mushrooms, poached in olive oil until supremely tender -- so delicious, deep and aromatic, you might want to eat the whole batch in one go. Plus you can make this recipe with your favorite mushrooms! Choose a single variety or a mix of different mushrooms... but always pick medium-sized specimens, so that they're easier to eat in one bite. Whole mushrooms also make for a better presentation.For a gourmet spread, serve this confit alongside these braised artichokes and these marinated olives with fennel. But the poached mushrooms are also wonderful as a condiment or side. Indeed, a spoonful of the flavorful morsels can brighten any main course, salad or soup!Although the oil they're cooked in is not consumed with the mushrooms, you can use it for other recipes -- see Viviane's tip below. Bon appétit!Wild Mushroom Confit with Garlic and Fresh Herbsmakes 2 cups active time: 30 min1 lb (455 g) assorted wild mushrooms (shiitake, oyster, Chanterelles, morels, black trumpet...) -- medium in size 2 cups extra virgin olive oil 8 large garlic cloves -- peeled and halved 12 large sage leaves 4 rosemary sprigs 6 thyme sprigs 8 winter savory sprigs 2 fresh bay leaves 2 teaspoons whole black Tellicherry peppercorns 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 1/2 tablespoons aged sherry wine vinegarBrush the mushrooms clean and trim the stems, but keep the mushrooms whole. Set aside. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat (I recommend a 12"" skillet). Add 1/3 cup of the oil and the mushrooms, toss carefully, and sauté undisturbed for 2 minutes until the mushrooms begin to brown. Toss again and continue to sauté until the mushrooms are golden-brown, about 4 to 5 minutes, tossing only from time to time. Add the garlic pieces and sauté for 1 minute until the garlic is golden, but not brown. Reduce heat to medium, add the balance of the oil and the herbs and peppercorns, and gently heat until the oil reaches 170F (80C) (use a thermometer). Once the oil has reached the desired temperature, continue poaching the mushrooms for 6 to 7 minutes, maintaining the temperature at 170F (80C), until the herbs are crisp and have turned a shade darker. Transfer the mushrooms, herbs and oil into a large bowl. Stir in the salt and vinegar and allow to cool to room temperature. To serve, scoop out the mushrooms with a slotted spoon and place in a serving bowl.Cook's note: Once cooled, the mushrooms can be refrigerated in their cooking oil for up to 1 week (make sure they are covered with the oil). Bring to room temperature before serving. To serve as a side dish, gently heat the mushrooms in their oil, drain, remove the herbs and peppercorns, and serve warm.Viviane's TipOnce you've consumed all these amazingly delicious mushrooms, don't throw the oil away. Strain it through a fine sieve and use it to make vinaigrettes, to drizzle over roasted or grilled vegetables, to sauté vegetables or to make sauces. It'll bring beautiful aromas and flavors to anything you cook with it. Refrigerate the strained oil for up to 1 month.* * *Here's another superb confit: Garlic confit!"

The future is unclear for the promising heart device aimed at preventing strokes in people at high risk of them because of an irregular heartbeat. Early results from a key study suggested it is safer than previous testing found, but may not be better than a drug that is used now for preventing strokes, heart-related deaths and blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation over the long term. The new study was to be the top presentation Saturday, March 9, 2013 at an American College of Cardiology conference in San Francisco. But the group took the unprecedented step of pulling it from the program just before it was to go on because Boston Scientific released results early to investors. (AP Photo/Boston Scientific)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9db6a226000033007ffbde.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dec 11 (Reuters) - An advisory panel of medical experts voted on Wednesday to recommend that U.S. health regulators approve an experimental stroke-prevention device made by Boston Scientific CorpThe panel voted 13 to 1 that the benefits outweigh the risks of the Watchman device. The committee advised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve the Watchman for the prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with a dangerous cardiac rhythm known as atrial fibrillation.People with atrial fibrillation, the most common type of arrhythmia, are five times more likely to suffer a stroke than those without the condition. It affects nearly 3 million people in the United States, and that number is expected to increase.The FDA typically follows the recommendations of its expert advisory panels, but is not obligated to do so.In documents prepared before the committee meeting, FDA staff members highlighted the implant's failure to meet a key goal for effectiveness in a recent study. But they said other data must be weighed in deciding whether it should be approved.The device, implanted in the heart to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, was developed as an alternative to clot-preventing blood thinners.It is aimed at sparing heart patients a lifetime of taking anticoagulant drugs, such as warfarin, which carry a high risk of bleeding.An FDA advisory panel recommended approval of the first-of-its-kind device in 2009, but the agency ultimately decided another study was needed to evaluate its safety and effectiveness.Boston Scientific acquired the Watchman device when it bought Atritech in March 2011. It has been on the market in Europe since 2005."
2,WELLNESS,Dreams Can Reveal and Soothe Holiday Season Stress,"DreamsCloud, Contributor

At work and at home, we're surrounded by celebrations and a spirit of giving.At least, that's the ideal way to view this time of year. The reality is, the holidays can also be enormously stressful. There's an intense focus on giving and receiving presents, spending money, and meeting social obligations, which can produce uninvited anxiety. Whether consciously or not, the holidays are filled with situations in which we feel socially evaluated by others, and assessed by our ability to give others what they want -- materially and emotionally.It's often difficult to make conscious sense of the conflicting messages we receive during the holiday season. On the one hand, we're told that the spirit of the season is one of selflessness and compassion; on the other, we're told to spend money and make people happy through finding and giving them the perfect gifts.But at night, when our conscious body is sleeping, our minds are helping us work through these mixed messages by way of our dreams -- and identifying and understanding these dreams can be very important and therapeutic during this time of year.Many people are surprised, after they decorate the house and spend the day making holiday preparations, that their dreams are not always filled with pleasant images. The visions dancing through our heads are often not of sugarplums!There's an increase in dreams fueled by the stress we otherwise ignore during the day. Some of the most commonly reported stress dreams during the holidays revolve around missing a flight, being overtaken by a tidal wave, falling from great heights, or even something as simple as losing your smartphone.What's happening during these dreams can have a huge impact on our waking life: Our brains are interpreting the emotional memories of the day, helping us to process the most troublesome thoughts and revealing hidden anxieties.But instead of interpreting these signals literally, the brain uses all of the information available to it -- which is why the images in our dreams are often highly symbolic.For instance, a seemingly never-ending list of things to do may be visualized by the mind as an open sea. The stress of an upcoming deadline (such as Christmas Eve) may, likewise, be interpreted by a ""dream-time"" brain as a massive wave. Put the two together, and even people who live in the desert can find themselves ""out to sea"" in a dream.Likewise, dreams related to falling through space often represent a loss of control -- and even though it may seem as though the house is clean and the in-laws are snug in their beds, the holidays are shared experiences that are out of our individual control.Paying attention to our dreams can transform our lives. No better example of this can be found, perhaps, than in a holiday-themed story: Charles Dickens' 1843 novel A Christmas Carol. Angry, embittered Ebenezer Scrooge undergoes a complete transformation in a single night, the result of three dreams, which he experiences as visits from ghosts.Dreaming that he will die the next day unless he changes his selfish behavior, he is told, ""Remember, Scrooge, time is short, and suddenly, you are not here anymore."" His Christmas Day transformation is miraculous.Dickens himself was enormously appreciative of dreams. ""And how many dreams are common to us all,"" he wrote in an 1851 letter. ""We all fall off that Tower, we all skim above the ground at a great pace ... We all go to public places in our night dresses and horribly disconcerted lest the company should observe it."" *Dreams can, in fact, be the greatest gift we receive at the holidays -- and they're free, with no fancy ribbons and bows attached. Dreams come to us whether we're prepared for them or not -- in fact, in an average lifetime, every one of us will have approximately 100,000 dreams! **Being aware of them is of enormous importance, and there are several techniques to record these marvelous and wondrous journeys of self-discovery. You can keep an old-fashioned journal by the bed and try to remember your dreams upon waking.Alternatively, you can also keep track of your dreams wherever you happen to remember them, by using new technology like DreamsCloud, which is the world's largest website devoted exclusively to dreams and is available on seven different platforms. DreamsCloud also offers every user the opportunity to get free, professional feedback (or a ""reflection"") on dreams from trained experts in the field of dream study.Keeping track of your dreams is the first step to understanding how dreams directly relate to your waking life. Just like Dickens' unforgettable character, every night in dreams, we have the opportunity to reinvent ourselves -- and during the holidays, in particular, we have the chance to let go of our everyday stress and let our brains make sense of it all while we sleep.References:* Winters, Warrington.

3,WELLNESS,These 8 Inspiring People Will Change The Way You Think About Autism And Asperger's,Laura Schocker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/autism-celebrities-aspergers_us_5b9db64ee4b03a1dcc8bda95,"""My path may not be one that another person would choose, but I challenged myself to enter the Miss America competition because",2013-12-12,"Susan Boyle performs during her musical 'I Dreamed A Dream' at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle, England, Tuesday, March 27, 2012. (AP Photo/Scott Heppell)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9db64e26000033007ffbac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 2009, a shy, 47-year-old Scottish woman touched the world with her breathtaking rendition of Les Misérables' ""I Dreamed A Dream"" on Britain's Got Talent. After the performance, Susan Boyle catapulted into a singing sensation, selling more than 14 million records worldwide.But despite her meteoric rise over the past few years, Boyle has, more recently, been coming to terms with a more private matter. Last week, she revealed to The Observer that she was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome by a Scottish specialist about a year ago -- a revelation that she calls ""a relief.""""Asperger's doesn't define me. It's a condition that I have to live with and work through, but I feel more relaxed about myself,"" she said in the interview. ""People will have a greater understanding of who I am and why I do the things I do.""Asperger syndrome is one of a group of developmental brain disorders, which are collectively called autism spectrum disorder or ASD, according to the National Institutes of Health. Asperger's affects the ability to socialize and communicate with others, the Mayo Clinic reports, and is characterized by symptoms that may include one-sided conversations, unusual nonverbal communication, obsession with one or two specific subjects and difficulty ""reading"" others. Other ASDs include autistic disorder (or classic autism), pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder.While many people in the public eye are speculated to have an autism spectrum disorder (among them, Courtney Love, Mozart and Tim Burton), Boyle joins a group of famous faces who have spoken out publicly about their diagnoses. Read on for seven more inspiring people with an autism spectrum disorder.James Durbin  The American Idol alum (from season 10), who recently released his new single, ""Parachute,"" was first diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and Tourette syndrome at age 10. ""Right around the time when I was diagnosed, I got a hand-me-down guitar with a chord book and a cheap busted tuner,"" Durbin told Autism Speaks last month. ""I think music is like medicine and can be a benefit for anyone no matter what genre. There’s just so much you can learn. It’s all about focus and for me, not only on the Autism spectrum but also the Tourette's spectrum, focus was something I needed help with. Music is my focus.""Music also became a way for Durbin to cope with bullying growing up. ""Throughout this process, I figured out that no matter how bad of a day I had at school, I could come home and create my own world within the music,"" he wrote on CNN. ""I could make the music as happy or as sad as I wanted it to be. I used the pain from being bullied to transform me into who I was meant to be.""Daryl Hannah  Earlier this year, the actress opened up to People magazine about being diagnosed with autism as a child, and how it contributed to a fear of fame as an adult, HuffPost previously reported. That fear caused Hannah to retreat from life in the spotlight. ""I've never been comfortable being the center of attention,"" she told People. ""It's always freaked me out.""Dan Aykroyd  The actor and writer told the Daily Mail earlier this week that, like Durbin, he has been diagnosed with both Tourette syndrome and Asperger syndrome. And he says the latter actually helped to inspire the movie Ghostbusters. ""I also have Asperger’s but I can manage it. It wasn’t diagnosed until the early 80s when my wife persuaded me to see a doctor,"" he told the Daily Mail. ""One of my symptoms included my obsession with ghosts and law enforcement -- I carry around a police badge with me, for example. I became obsessed by Hans Holzer, the greatest ghost hunter ever. That’s when the idea of my film Ghostbusters was born.""Heather Kuzmich  When America's Next Top Model cycle nine began in 2007, the audience met 21-year-old Heather Kuzmich, who was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. ""It was a point in my life where I was thinking either Asperger’s was going to define me or I was going to be able to work around it,” Kuzmich told The New York Times of her decision to join the competition show. ""At first I was really worried people would laugh at me because I was so very awkward. I got the exact opposite.""The contestant finished in fifth place, and was voted as the viewer favorite eight weeks in a row. ""I was at the bottom of the totem pole,"" she told People about her time growing up. ""I wanted to be a role model for girls who aren't the most popular and are picked on.""Dan Harmon  The Community creator started learning more about Asperger syndrome while developing the character of Abed for the NBC show. ""So, in a very naive way -- and I’ve never told anybody this before -- I started researching the disorder,"" Harmon told Wired in 2011. ""I started looking up these symptoms, just to know what they are. And the more I looked them up, the more familiar they started to seem. Then I started taking these Internet tests.""Wired reports:Eventually, Harmon met with a doctor and came to understand that symptoms of the disorder lie on a spectrum, and that in fact there is a place on it for people with inappropriate emotional reactions and deep empathy. Harmon now sees that he may fit somewhere on that spectrum, though figuring out exactly where could take years.Alexis Wineman  Earlier this year, Miss Montana became the first Miss America contestant with autism to compete in the pageant. At age 11, Wineman was diagnosed with pervasive development disorder, CNN reported.""My path may not be one that another person would choose, but I challenged myself to enter the Miss America competition because it seemed like the peak to my own personal Everest,"" she wrote for CNN in January. ""It also seemed kind of ironic: a girl who was told she was different and considered an outcast by many, in the nation's biggest beauty pageant.""She reached the top 15 in the competition, and won the America's Choice Award, according to CNN, for garnering the most online viewer votes. ""So many people expect autistic people to all be the same -- that it’s a brain disorder so we can’t function in society,"" she told Time. ""I want people to realize there’s a whole spectrum of people who live with autism. There are high-functioning people and low-functioning people.""Temple Grandin  A professor of animal sciences at Colorado State University, the university calls her ""the most accomplished and well-known adult with autism in the world."" According to her website, Grandin didn't speak until she was three and a half years old, ""communicating her frustration instead by screaming, peeping and humming."" After receiving a diagnosis of autism, her parents were told she should be institutionalized. She wrote in her book, Emergence: Labeled Autistic:I have read enough to know that there are still many parents, and yes, professionals too, who believe that 'once autistic, always autistic.' This dictum has meant sad and sorry lives for many children diagnosed, as I was in early life, as autistic. To these people, it is incomprehensible that the characteristics of autism can be modified and controlled. However, I feel strongly that I am living proof that they can.In addition to her work in the animal sciences (among her other accomplishments, Grandin developed corrals to improve quality of life for cattle), she has become an outspoken advocate in the autism community. In 2010, TIME named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world, and HBO produced a biopic based on her life called Temple Grandin, starring Claire Danes as the title character."
