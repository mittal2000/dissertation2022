(AP Photo/Antonio Calanni)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e420200000f9010184af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ROME (RNS) Fresh from his Oscar win for best foreign film, Italian director Paolo Sorrentino’s next project is a TV series about a fictional American pope.Sorrentino, who won for his sumptuous, stream-of-consciousness feature, “La Grande Bellezza” (or “The Great Beauty”), will now direct an imaginary pope named Lenny Belardo. The actor chosen to play the Roman Catholic pontiff has not been announced.Sorrentino also previously directed “This Must Be the Place,” an English-language story about a goth musician played by Sean Penn who, after the death of his father, a Holocaust survivor, comes out of self-imposed exile to become a Nazi hunter.The new series will be no less controversial; given Sorrentino’s wildly inventive style, the series will likely skirt between the sacred and profane.The working title for the series is “The Young Pope,” and the 43-year-old director hopes to create fictional mysteries and scandals within the walls of the Vatican.The Italian production company Wildside, Rupert Murdoch’s Sky TV and U.S. producer John Lyons are co-producing the project.“The series is about dreams, fears, conflicts, battles, the search for meaning and the need for love of a pope, seen through Sorrentino’s unique vision capable of creating worlds that are at the same incredible and more real than reality itself,” said Wildside’s Lorenzo Mieli and Mario Gianani in a statement.The series will include eight 50-minute episodes with an international cast and will be shot at the Vatican, Italy, Africa and the U.S.The producers were unavailable for comment on Tuesday (April 8). But in an interview with the Italian daily Corriere della Sera, Mieli predicted that the imaginary pope would rival other complex characters, including Tony Soprano in “The Sopranos,” Walter White in “Breaking Bad” and Frank Underwood in “House of Cards.”“The pope invented by Sorrentino is someone you have to meet at least once in your life,” said Mieli.Mieli said the lead character would be played by “an international actor” but gave no further details.Hollywood director Ridley Scott recently filmed a TV series, “The Vatican,” in Rome, starring Bruno Ganz as the fictional present-day Pope Sixtus VI, while “The Borgias,” a historical fiction series created by Irish filmmaker Neil Jordan, sought to re-create the life of Pope Alexander VI at the turn of the 16th century."

(AP Photo/Chuck Burton)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e42b2600003001836ebd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) A new paper draws an intriguing conclusion to a question scholars have wrestled with for several decades: Why are Americans dropping out of church?One reason? They’re logging on to the Internet.Allen Downey, a professor of computer science at Massachusetts’ Olin College of Engineering, found that between 1990 and 2010 the share of Americans claiming no religious affiliation grew from 8 percent to 18 percent while the number of Americans connected to the Internet rose from almost nothing to 80 percent.Downey cautions — as do his critics — that correlation does not equal causation.“We can’t know for sure that Internet use causes religious disaffiliation,” Downey said. “It is always possible that disaffiliation causes Internet use, or that a third factor causes both.”But Downey, whose paper, “Religious affiliation, education and Internet use,” was published late last month at — where else? — an online site dedicated to scientific papers, is pretty sure he’s onto something.Examining data from the General Social Survey, an ongoing and multigenerational study of Americans, Downey draws a link between higher levels of education and income and lower levels of religious identification.His study shows that as Americans reported more Internet use, their religious identification dropped. Those who reported only a few hours of weekly Internet use were 2 percent less likely to claim a religious affiliation than those who use no Internet. And those who use the Internet more than seven hours weekly are even less likely to adhere to a religion — by an additional 3 percentage points. “That effect turns out to be stronger than a four-year college education, which reduces religious affiliation by about 2 percentage points,” he said.Other scholars say Downey’s finding may be too pat.Stephen O’Leary, an associate professor at the University of Southern California who studies religion on the Internet, thinks the situation is more complex and nuanced.“Let’s call it the influence of the religious marketplace,” O’Leary said. Since the 1960s, with the influx of non-Christian immigrants to the U.S. and the increased mobility of society, Americans’ exposure to a wide range of spiritual, religious and nonreligious ideas has burgeoned.“Internet use is part of that, but what it really does is magnify to a dramatic level the degree of choices one has,” O’Leary said.Other forces unrelated to the Internet are at work, too. O’Leary said younger Americans are less likely to trust religious authority in the wake of the Catholic Church child sex abuse scandals.“That has, more than almost any other thing, alienated a whole generation,” O’Leary said. “And it is not just Catholics. It goes to all religious authority by extension.”Still, O’Leary cautions that the decline in religious affiliation — due to the Internet or otherwise — does not mean an equal rise in atheism.“They haven’t given up their belief in the supernatural. They just don’t feel they need organizations or institutions to bring it to them,” he said. “And you don’t have to believe in any god to light a candle or hold hands and utter a mantra or chant.”Downey’s findings dovetail with those of the Pew Research Center’s 2012 look at the “nones,” the terminology for Americans with no religious affiliation. That study found that almost 20 percent of all Americans — and a third of those under 30 — are nones.By examining data from the CIRP Freshman Survey, conducted among first-year college students, Downey discovered that between 1985 and 2013 — approximately the same amount of time that the GSS measured Internet usage — the percentage of freshmen who identified as nonreligious tripled, from 8 percent to 25 percent. He predicts on his blog that number will reach almost 26 percent next year — more than the share of students who identify as Catholic.“I think this is an underreported story,” Downey said.Still, Downey is cautious about blaming the Internet, which he figures accounts for only about 20 percent of the overall decline in religious affiliation. An additional 25 percent, he says, can be attributed to fewer people being raised with a religious affiliation, and 5 percent might be due to increases in college education.“That leaves 50 percent of the decrease unexplained by the factors I was able to include in the study, which raises interesting questions for future research,” he said."

The former Creed frontman said the only one he lost faith in was himself.Beginning in the late 1990s, Stapp’s soulful voice and Creed’s guitar-powered rock brought the band to the top of the charts, selling 60 million albums and releasing 11 No. 1 hits including “Higher” and the Grammy-winning “With Arms Wide Open.”But on the road to stardom, Stapp lost control of his life.“It amplified all my problems,” he said of fame and fortune in a phone conversation. “It made every single problem in my life that much bigger, that much on the world stage, being under a microscope. Even your family and friends look at you different.”Stapp began drinking heavily and became addicted to prescription drugs. He had a serious car accident in 2002, suffering vertebrae damage and a concussion. In 2006 he fell from a hotel balcony in Miami, hitting a ledge 40 feet below. He fractured his skull and suffered numerous broken bones. In his 2012 autobiography, “Sinner’s Creed,” Stapp said he would have died if rapper T.I. had not found him lying in a pool of blood two hours later.Life hit rock bottom one night when he found himself on his hands and knees in his backyard at three in the morning, desperate for help.“I think that at some level I had to get broken to the point of complete surrender, where I could no longer depend on myself or anyone else and I only had one place to turn to, and I cried out to God for help,” Stapp said. “And right at that moment is when my life began to change.”Stapp went through rehab and turned his life around.These days, Stapp said, his only “meds” are running five miles a day and being surrounded by the love of his wife, three children, and God.The 40-year-old rocker said he has resolved the conflicts that lingered from being raised in a strict fundamentalist Christian family led by a spiritually “abusive” stepfather.He said his stepfather thought he was doing the right thing by imposing legalistic Christian standards. What he was missing, Stapp said, was the love St. Paul writes about in his letter to the Corinthians: “Love is patient, love is kind. … It is not easily angered.”Stapp speaks with enthusiasm about reclaiming his life and renewing his relationship with God. He is overjoyed to have escaped death and seeks to “pay my experience forward by helping others.”The primary way he shares his story is through his music, particularly his new solo album, “Proof of Life.”“In hindsight, I guess my art and my music is a form of therapy for me. It’s a way to deal with things going on in my life and in my mind,” he said.Jeff Howe, program director at YES-FM Christian radio, said the Toledo, Ohio, station is playing Stapp’s solo music and noted that his single, “Slow Suicide,” reached No. 1 on the national Christian rock charts.“One thing going for him is that he speaks from the heart and shares his personal experiences in his music. The current generation wants it to be real,” Howe said. “They can spot phonies. His experience connects with people.”Stapp called “Proof of Life” a “transformational record” that has helped him “turn that mess into a message.”“It’s a fitting title because I had one foot in the grave and I was living in an ‘on-the-way-to-death’ place,” he said. “I had been written off by friends, certain family members, my business, and there were even rumors that I had died. So for me, this album was literally ‘Proof of Life.’ It’s not the end; it’s the beginning.”"

""The church has to face it is everywhere in the world. There is so much denial. The church has to respond to make the church safe for children.""O'Malley, whose Boston archdiocese was at the center of a wave of sex scandals that rocked the church a decade ago, addressed the media after the panel's eight members held its first meeting in Rome.Pope Francis announced the creation of the new committee in March. It includes Irish abuse victim and campaigner Marie Collins and two psychiatrists. But the committee is expected to expand to represent every continent around the world.""We wish to express our heartfelt solidarity with all victims/survivors of sexual abuse as children and vulnerable adults,"" O'Malley read from a prepared statement.""We will propose initiatives to encourage local responsibility around the world and the mutual sharing of 'best practices' for the protection of all minors, including programs for training, education, formation and responses to abuse.""Collins, who was sexually abused by a priest at age 13, said she, too, had been ""shocked"" by the denial she had witnessed among some Catholic bishops about the extent of clerical sexual abuse.""...They truly believed it only happened in certain countries,"" she said.The committee met as the Vatican is about to face fresh scrutiny from a United Nations panel on torture in Geneva this week.In February, a U.N. committee on the rights of the child denounced the Vatican for adopting policies that allowed priests to sexually abuse thousands of children and called for known and suspected abusers to be immediately removed.Francis strongly rejected the report's findings, saying that no other organization had done more to fight pedophilia and the church had acted with ""transparency and responsibility.""The pope recently said he took personal responsibility for the ""evil"" of clerical sex abuse, sought forgiveness from victims and said the church must do more to protect children.Collins said that while she had ""difficulty"" with the pope's claims that the church had done more than any other institution to act on abuse, she said she believed the church was moving forward, but stressed that the effort was still in its ""early days.""Francis announced the creation of the commission last December and named its members in March after coming under initial criticism for having ignored the sex abuse issue. The commission's eight members -- four of whom are women -- met for the first time this week at the pope's Vatican hotel to discuss the scope of their work and future members.Briefing reporters Saturday, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the archbishop of Boston, said current church laws could hold bishops accountable if they fail to do their jobs to protect children. But he said those laws hadn't been sufficient to date and new protocols were needed.""Obviously our concern is to make sure that there are clear and effective protocols to deal with the situations where superiors of the church have not fulfilled their obligations to protect children,"" O'Malley said. That could include an effort toward creating an ""open process"" that ""would hold people accountable for their responsibility to protect children.""Victims groups have long cited the case of O'Malley's predecessor in Boston, Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned in disgrace as archbishop after the sex abuse scandal exploded publicly there in 2002. But Pope John Paul II then appointed Law to the plum assignment as archpriest of one of the Vatican's four major basilicas in Rome. Even today, another U.S. bishop remains in office despite having been convicted of misdemeanor failure to report suspected child abuse.Francis' new advisory board said in a concluding statement that church accountability is ""especially important"" to the members and that in their founding statutes they would emphasize the ""devastating consequences"" for victims when suspected abuse is not reported.Marie Collins, a committee member and Irish survivor of sexual abuse, said she came away from the inaugural meeting of the commission ""hopeful"" primarily because the issue of accountability was addressed straight on.""I know there are many survivors around the world who are hoping, and have great expectations of this commission,"" Collins said. ""And what I can say so far is you can't make concrete promises. But as a survivor myself, I am hopeful that we are going to achieve what is hoped for. It's very, very important.""O'Malley said another area that the commission would address is giving advice to national bishops' conferences to improve their own guidelines for handling abuse cases. Recently, the Italian bishops' conference released their guidelines and said they had no legal obligation to report suspected abuse to police.The commission met on the eve of a U.N. committee meeting in Geneva in which the Vatican is expected to come under a second round of criticism for its handling of abuse. A U.N. committee monitoring implementation of a key treaty on children's rights blasted the Holy See earlier this year, accusing it of systematically placing its own interests over those of victims by enabling priests to rape and molest tens of thousands of children through its own policies and code of silence.It recommended the Vatican immediately remove any priest suspected or known to have abused children, open its archives on abusers and the bishops who covered up for them, and turn the cases over to law enforcement.___Follow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield"

According to details of experts' findings published by the specialist British journal The Art Newspaper and the Spanish media, the work is a copy painted in Da Vinci's studio by one of his pupils. AFP PHOTO / JAVIER SORIANO (Photo credit should read JAVIER SORIANO/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb26fab210000e700c77c61.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Leonard da Vinci was the original Renaissance man, dabbling in not just art, but anatomy, geology, botany, cartography, mathematics, literature and much, much more. Not only do we give him credit for masterpieces like ""The Last Supper"" and ""The Vitruvian Man,"" history praises his work in musical instrument construction, hydraulics, cannon design and early flying machines. So it wouldn't hurt, we suppose, to credit the man with 3D imagery too.It's a claim German researchers Claus-Christian Carbon and Vera Hesslinger assert in their study of Leonardo's famous portrait, ""Mona Lisa."" The pair have been analyzing the well-known version of La Giaconda that hangs at Paris' Louvre, as well as an eerily similar copy known as the ""Prado Mona Lisa,"" housed at the Museo del Prado in Spain, and have concluded that the two artworks -- taken together -- may amount to the first stereoscopic image in the world. In other words, our first 3D artwork. The Portrait of Mona Lisa painted by Leonardo da Vinci (L) and a picture taken at Madrid's Prado Museum of a copy of Mona Lisa (R). (JEAN-PIERRE MULLER-JAVIER SORIAN/AFP/Getty Images)Carbon and Hesslinger base their theory on side-by-side comparisons of ""Mona Lisa"" and her Prado counterpart -- a painting introduced to the public back in 2012 as the possible work of Leonardo or one of his students. They claim that there is a slight perspective shift between the two works, meaning that the portraits were painted from separate vantage points. ""When I first perceived the two paintings side by side, it was very obvious for me that there is a very small but evident difference in perspectives,"" Carbon, of the University of Bamberg in Germany, wrote in an email to Live Science. ""This is particularly clear if you observe the chair on which La Gioconda sits: In the Prado version, you can still see the end of the end corner of the chair at the background of the painting, which you cannot see in the Louvre version, because the painter of the Prado version looked at the 'Mona Lisa' more from the left than the painter of the Louvre version.""Intrigued, Carbon and Hesslinger decided to calculate the positions the painter (or painters) would have taken to create each ""Mona Lisa"" version. They found that the horizontal difference between the two paintings was about 2.7 inches, which happens to be very close to the average distance between a person's eyes. Here's where the researchers take their leap into 3D hypotheses. Each of our eyes perceive objects at different perspectives, sending two separate, flat images to our brain to be translated into one three-dimensional representation. That is the image we ""see."" Similarly, Carbon and Hesslinger surmise that the two perspectives used in the Louvre and Prado ""Mona Lisas"" could amount to one 3D image. Place the visual information together, and you have a stereoscopic masterpiece. Mona Lisa: hand region in 3D (red-cyan anaglyph)They've used a red–cyan anaglyph to combine the two portraits -- namely, the area depicting La Giaconda's hands -- and the result is like gazing upon Leonardo's mysterious woman without 3D glasses. Essentially, there's depth. But it's impossible to know whether Carbon and Hesslinger's observations are coincidental, or if Leonardo intentionally created the first stereoscopic art. ""DaVinci did write about monocular and binocular vision, and studied aspects of optics including eye anatomy and light reflection, and he even experimented with colored light sources,"" Science News' Erika Engelhaupt writes. ""But it’s not clear whether he put all the pieces together to understand how to create a stereoscopic image. The paintings don’t quite make a perfect stereo pair.""You can read Carbon and Hesslinger's entire study here. Let us know your thoughts on Leonardo's 3D aspirations in the comments.

Just Google his name, and Chahal is shown grinning beside an equally ebullient President Obama.Yet, within days of the news of his crime becoming public, the media was calling for his head, the Disrupt conference dropped RadiumOne as a sponsor, and as the final coup de grace, Chahal's board removed him from his role as CEO.Case closed... except for Chahal, perhaps, who took to the Internet in his own feeble defense, claiming that the victim brought it on herself only to expunge his tweets and blog posts days later as the public furor only grew.Everyone has been asking questions: Why did it take the board so long to act? Why was Chahal able to plea down such serious allegations? When will we see the tape of the assault?At Hippo Reads, we explore questions that inspire debate through the lens of academia. In keeping with that, the questions we've been asking are a little bit different. What is relevant for us is not what happened behind closed doors on August 5, but what the repercussions of that event mean -- and more importantly, what they say about us.What type of private wrongdoing warrants the firing of a CEO? That the board fired Chahal is not surprising. Media furor was only growing, and partners and customers were dropping the company in spades, and the prospective IPO was suddenly in question. The nuance of the question, however, is not so much why Chahal was fired, but how we define the threshold for firings of this type. Asked differently, what was it about the domestic violence incident that triggered such a strong reaction? Had Chahal been guilty of another crime -- drunk driving, flouting drug laws, or immigration fraud -- it is likely the board would not have reacted in the same way.In April of this year, founder of Iron Data Jeffrey Smock, was arrested for the beating of a motorist during a traffic dispute. The assault was severe enough that bystanders were concerned the victim may not have survived. Smock's arrest made very small waves in the news, and nobody argued that Smock should face professional repercussions.After all, Chahal is, if not in good, then in ample company. Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich was forced to step down when his support of a 2008 anti-gay marriage campaign became news. Clippers owner Donald Sterling was banned for life by the NBA after racist comments he had came to light, and is coming under pressure to sell the team. While neither racism nor discrimination based on sexual orientation are criminal offenses, they are social issues that inspire moral repugnance against their offenders. They represent not only wrongdoing against an individual, but against a group. Is it morally right to hire or fire people based on crimes committed?It's debatable whether Chahal was fired for the assault itself or for the fact that he had entered a guilty plea. Indeed, the board knew about the situation and chose to sit on it for 10 months. They've cited the admirable presumption of innocence doctrine as the reason for the delay -- but one has to ask, how would they have acted if the story had broken earlier, and they'd spent 10 months dealing with sidelined business deals and partners dropping off.Here's what makes the issue thorny. Firing (or not hiring) on the basis of criminal history is the only form of discrimination still legal in the United States. Companies are allowed to run background checks and say they're not hiring criminals. Job applications can't ask you if you're pregnant, but they can -- and do -- regularly ask if you've ever been convicted of a crime. As Michelle Alexander poignantly argues in The New Jim Crow this is problematic because our legal system does not punish equally. We've long known that Americans of color in general, and Black men in particular, bear the brunt of draconian drug laws and unequal enforcement. The result is that the legal discrimination keeps swaths of the population out of work and out of housing. And it is this Catch-22 -- keeping a steady job is often a condition of parole, but finding one with a criminal record is almost impossible -- that contributes to recidivism and high crime rates among the post-prison population.I'm not suggesting Chahal is a victim of this dynamic or that his future is at risk. It would be silly to argue that he had anything except the best legal counsel, support, and advice. Although his career may have taken a hit, his lifestyle certainly won't. But the problem with high profile cases like these is that they can seem to justify similar treatment for others -- even though they may not be as privileged as Chahal. And while US law doesn't forbid terminations for reasons of criminal conduct, the office of Unemployment Benefits adds an interesting element. If you were fired, they say, you may still be eligible for unemployment. Committing a crime makes you ineligible if the crime was connected with your job -- such as destruction of company property, a DUI while on company business, or assaulting a coworker. In essence, it seems to imply that if your crime was not connected with your job, the Office of Unemployment doesn't care.So does a domestic violence conviction suggest that you'll be a bad CEO?This is an uncomfortable question, to say the least, but deserves to be asked because it's valuable to parse out the true reason behind the firing. Was it preventive or punitive? That is to say, is this a character flaw that will produce poor leadership? Or, is this a punitive measure -- a case of ostracizing a person whose morals the public finds repugnant, no matter whether or not this plays a (direct) role in Chahal's ability to lead? Researchers have shown that many CEOs and entrepreneurs have psychopathic tenancies (that's why my co-founder and I don't have CEO titles). Moreover, as most domestic abuse and crisis centers report, abusers rarely take their abuse outside the domestic sphere. ""Most abusive men get along very well with others, and are often considered charming and charismatic by everyone -- except their partner and children,"" one crisis center explains. And, here's another curious study -- it turns out CEOs who spend time publicly promoting their dedication to ethics and corporate responsibility are actually more likely to behave in ways that are socially irresponsible. Enron once had unprecedented levels of corporate philanthropy, and just a few years before the Deepwater Horizon spill, British Petroleum touted its safety record as the best in the industry. If this data seems to point to Chahal being a decent CEO in spite of his criminal history, the timeline of his termination also supports that. The information about his decision to plead guilty was not news to the board. If their concern was only the presumption of innocence, they could have fired him the day the guilty plea was entered. Why then, did they choose to wait until the public outrage grew and forced their hand?Was the decision to fire Chahal more about us than about him?Such a swift reaction to public pressure by the board is a sign of changing times. When I was fresh out of college in 2004, and an analyst at venture firm, I took it as a given I'd be the only woman at any event. I spent that first year fending off unwanted advances. My fellow (male) analysts were busy networking and learning from the experience of others. I was anxious to find a mentor outside my firm who could help navigate a venture career. One such opportunity seemed to present itself -- but after we'd spent a perfectly professional lunch discussing deal flow, he tried to kiss me. We've come a long way in 10 years. We've witnessed a more engaged dialogue about women's issues. Colleges are taking flak for their poor handling of sexual assault on their campuses. President Obama and Vice President Biden are recruiting notable men to star in PSAs about domestic violence and sexual assault.The world has changed, and Silicon Valley is changing with it. Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In has sparked a much-needed dialogue about making corporate leadership more available to women. Organizations like Girls Who Code have sprung up to create diversity in what once was a boys-only tech club. Seen in this context, Chahal's termination is a statement -- not just to Chahal himself, or the company's employees or partners or stakeholders. It is a statement in support of women who are becoming an important constituency in Silicon Valley -- who are building companies, running venture funds, and whose voices are joining together and being heard.--------with contribution by Andrew Jing and Kaitlin Solimine of Hippo ReadsVisit www.hipporeads.com"

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, Pool, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c7043c000018010df46c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Past - Failed Efforts Despite the heroic efforts of Secretary of State John Kerry and Special Envoy Martin Indyk to bring Israel and the Palestinians to agreement, the current peace process effort has failed. To understand what the future holds, it is worth looking at why the process failed and what courses of action are now available. As a starting point, it is abundantly clear that although we are often told that the United States can't ""want the peace more than the parties"" that was indeed what happened. While we cannot fully know what went on in the secret negotiations between Israeli negotiator, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat, one issue that was negotiated in the public view tells the story. At one point of time in the negotiation process, Prime Minister Netanyahu presented a new pre-condition -- that the Palestinians recognize Israel as the ""nation state of the Jewish people,"" which became phrased as recognition as ""a Jewish state."" While one could make the argument that such recognition would reflect the willingness of the Palestinians to put an end to the conflict and live with their neighbor, it was never before a stated pre-condition to negotiations and in light of the abundant and enormously sophisticated protections being negotiated for Israel's security, it is questionable to what extent Palestinian recognition was truly required in any event. By raising it as an essential pre-condition, Netanyahu showed that at best his desire for a deal was not compelling, and even, as the Palestinians argued, that he was actually looking for a reason not to have to move forward on a deal. On the other side, was the refusal of Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian National Authority, to satisfy Netanyahu's condition. After all, even Yasser Arafat had openly stated that peace would bring a ""Palestinian and a Jewish state"" living side by side. Abbas' arguments against agreeing to recognize Israel as a Jewish state did not convince even those strongly supporting a two state solution. At the least, if Abbas truly wanted a deal, he could have said he was prepared to recognize Israel as a Jewish state when all the other issues were resolved satisfactorily or indicated he would trade it off in the negotiating process. Obviously, for whatever reason, he didn't want a deal enough to do that.Other actions by each side further demonstrated that neither side was concerned with the negative reaction of the other. All during the negotiating period, Israel continued to expand settlements, reportedly finalizing 4868 home tenders and processing plans for another 8983 homes. And while a number of these were in areas that were expected to be part of Israel after the final borders were established, the sheer size of the expansion and the timing of announcing new building had to be a blow to Abbas' political standing and sent a message that the Palestinians read as showing that Israel was just using the negotiating period to expand settlements and had no real interest in a deal. Similarly, when Abbas signed a ""Reconciliation Agreement"" with Hamas, the sworn enemy of Israel dedicated to its destruction, the arguments that the ""technocrats"" would run the joint government until elections and even that the final governing body would agree to the three principles of the Quartet (EU, UN, U.S., Russia,) including recognition of Israel and renouncing violence, not surprisingly fell on deaf Israeli ears.Why were both parties so reluctant to make a deal? In both cases there were rejectionist forces acting against a deal and most importantly, both general publics -- Israeli and Palestinian -- were never engaged in supporting a deal. At best, they were apathetic.In Israel, powerful forces were aligned against a deal. These are primarily religious nationalists who make up a significant part of Israel's governing coalition. They include members of Netanyahu's Likud party and of the Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home) party, led by Naftali Bennett, who aspire to expand Israeli control over the West Bank and in some instance to annex it as part of Greater Israel. It is not clear, but those forces may also include the Russian Jewish party (Yisrael Beitenu) led by Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. In order for Netanyahu to enter into an agreement with Abbas, he would have to be willing to see his governing coalition collapse and to try to form a new coalition. While Isaac (""Bougie"") Herzog, head of the Labor Party, held out the prospect of joining such a new coalition, that was a difficult political choice for Netanyahu. Moreover, a deal might require moving as many as 100,000 settlers from their homes at a great political and financial cost. In that context, while the polls show that most Israelis support a two state solution in theory, Israelis are mainly focused on domestic issues and there is no urgent desire to change the status quo. Under those circumstances, it is hardly surprising that despite all of Kerry's cajoling, Netanyahu, brought up in a revisionist Zionist home, only lately come to accept a two-state solution, was not going to risk his comfortable position as Israel's longest lasting Prime Minister to make a deal.For his part, Abbas faced growing opposition to a deal from those Palestinians, especially younger people, who believe their best interests lie in a bi-national state with Israel. The Palestinian public, like the Israeli public, generally show support in polls for a two state solution. But here, too, there is no public pressure to press forward with a deal. Abbas, at age 79, seeing the Oslo Agreement that he was instrumental in creating result in 400,000 Israeli settlers and seeing a very difficult negotiation ahead with no assurance of success, understandably decided to leave the problem to his successor. The Future In the immediate aftermath of the failed effort, Secretary Kerry's message about future plans for the peace process contained two thoughts: ""We believe the best thing to do right now is pause, take a hard look at these things, and find out what is possible and what is not possible."" However, referring to what he called ""significant progress in certain areas"" Kerry stated: ""What has not been laid out publicly and what I will do at some appropriate moment of time is make clear to everybody the progress that was made.""There are those on the left who believe that what the Obama administration should do now is present to the parties and the international community its view of what the final status agreement should look like, covering each of the areas -- Recognition of a Jewish State, borders, security, the status of Jerusalem and the claim of a right of return. And perhaps that is what Kerry is suggesting. But it is hard to see what impact this will have unless the President is prepared to put some teeth in the recommendation, and given the political cost of that course, it is highly unlikely. So laying out the Obama vision will be much along the lines of the ""Clinton parameters"" presented by President Bill Clinton in 2000 or the exposition by ex-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert after his 2008 negotiation with Abbas -- a basis for future negotiations and discussion. The truth is that unless something comes along -- either in the form of great pain or great benefit -- that galvanizes the Israeli and Palestinian general publics to see this process as a central rather than tangential issue in their lives, nothing will happen to change the political dynamics. Of course, nobody wants to see the pain of violence from an intifada or the costs of a collapse of the Palestinian Authority. And it is unlikely that in the near future the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) will have a serious impact on Israel. (See my blog ""The BDS Threat To Israel: A Realistic Appraisal""). By the same token, it is difficult to conceive of significant benefits that could be available. All that seems to be left is a slow, educational process for the Israeli public on how continued control over the Palestinians can lead to pressure for a bi-national state that will erode the Jewish and democratic values of their nation and of the Palestinians on how such control will not eventuate in their being a part of Israel, but only in losing their hope of governing themselves in their own state.

Can you feel the excitement?In the absence of big initiative battles or high-profile, big money candidates slugging it out, we are left with, well, what we are left with. Primarily, that's the question of which little known Republican will emerge from the open primary into the November run-off with Governor Jerry Brown. Yes, there are a slew of other statewide races, with Democrats salivating to repeat 2010's sweep, and a little suspense about two in particular, the races for state controller and secretary of state. In both those races, public polls have shown Republicans to be in the lead, with Fresno Mayor Ashley Swearingen, who rose to prominence as a leader of the Arnold Schwarzenegger-created California Partnership for the San Joaquin Valley, leading for controller and former marketing executive Pete Peterson, director of Pepperdine University's Davenport Institute for Civic Engagement, leading for secretary of state. Each benefits from being the only name Republican in a field with two or more prominent Democrats. The only serious threat to Governor Jerry Brown's re-election is, as I warned last fall, his continuing stubborn refusal to plan to prevent deadly kaiju attacks. This kaiju attack scenario, resulting in the destruction of Brown's hometown of San Francisco, made available by Pacific Rim producers.Also at stake is an early test of a statewide independent candidacy. We'll see if independent Dan Schnur can stage a late surge in the secretary of state race to finish in the top two and make it into the November general election. Former communications director for Pete Wilson's governorship and John McCain's first presidential campaign, Schnur, director of the USC Unruh Institute for Politics changed from Republican to independent several years ago and served as former Governor Schwarzenegger's pick chairing the Fair Political Practices Commission. He's a very capable guy whom I've known for over 20 years who could do a great job as secretary of state. But is there a base of voters for an independent who is not vastly funded?But most interest in this most sedate of California elections is around the fight for the right to lose to Jerry Brown in the fall. Having smashed eBay billionaire Meg Whitman's biggest spending non-presidential campaign in the history of American politics to win his third term as governor before going on to end the state's chronic budget crisis, Brown's decision to go for a record-setting fourth term, which I predicted from the beginning, proved a tremendous disincentive for anyone else to run. Since I also expect U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer, with whom I worked on the state solar commission during Brown's first go-round as governor when the future senator was a Marin County supervisor, to run for yet another term in 2016, the next big decision point in California politics likely won't come until 2018.That is when Brown will be prevented from running for a fifth term as governor by California's term limits law, which did not apply to him until now because it was enacted after he served his first two terms in 1970s and '80s. That is also when Senator Dianne Feinstein will be up again for re-election. Like Boxer, who is now 73, Feinstein was first elected in 1992. But DiFi turns 81 next month. Now having a rough go of it as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, she would be 85 running in the 2018 general election. Not impossible, but I don't think likely.But the drama of 2018 -- perhaps not quite as dramatic if Brown, who I always thought was a more natural senator than governor, opts for a global debating society phase in his life adventure -- is still off in the distance. For now we are stuck with the ""battle"" for the GOP gubernatorial nod -- and arguably the soul of what is left of the California Republican Party -- between fringe right state Assemblyman Tim Donnelly and former U.S. assistant Treasury secretary Neel Kashkari, the new hope of Republican modernizers after Schwarzenegger's appointed lieutenant governor, veteran legislator Abel Maldonado -- the logical choice to mount a respectable opposition campaign against Brown -- saw his campaign implode.Since then, despite a lot of publicity for Kashkari, he has remained mired in the low single digits in public polls, with Donnelly running a clear if extremely distant second to Brown. Kashkari has even trailed the Republican mayor of Laguna Hills, whose name I always forget and who, in any event, has dropped out due to ill health, as well as a registered sex offender who, for some reason clear only to him, saw fit to run for governor of California. The Kashkari camp has said not to worry, that the coordinator of the Wall Street bailout would close the gap and surge ahead of Donnelly with paid advertising. But that costs money. A lot of money in a big and relatively indifferent state like California. And it seems that Kashkari's candidacy for governor, like much of the rest of the American economy, is yet another investment opportunity that the bailout recipients have decided to pass up.As I predicted, Kashkari's quick fundraising start just as quickly fizzled. He raised a million dollars in the first two weeks following his announcement of candidacy. Since then, he has struggled to raise as much again.In fact, by my estimation of campaign reports since the March 17th filing deadline, Kashkari is still short of the $2 million mark. He's raised about $1.8 million since he began. Given his past spending practices, my guess is he has a little over a million dollars cash on hand going into the final month of the campaign.That's not enough money to run any appreciable television advertising campaign, which is what an unknown candidate needs. Kashkari could do some radio, and/or a few targeted direct mail pieces. And he's already signed on to a number of slate mailers, on which his name will appear with a host of other candidates pushed for a slew of offices. Unless Kashkari raises a few million dollars in the next two weeks, he simply won't be able to communicate in any serious way through advertising. And even that would be an iffy proposition.And what is he communicating?His campaign announced his first campaign mailer, refusing to say where it was going or how much was being spent on it. It proclaims the candidate to be a ""conservative Republican."" But as a pro-gay marriage, pro-choice, pro-illegal immigrant rights person from a South Asian background who never served in the military but who did preside over one of the biggest government spending programs in American history, and voted for Barack Obama in 2008 to boot, he doesn't really look like a conservative Republican.Plus he has a twofold communications challenge. Kashkari has to build himself up at the same time that he takes down Donnelly.Is there an independent expenditure committee for that purpose about to pop? Frankly, the Republicans would be better off trying to run, well, me as their modernizer candidate. As a WASP who was in the military, did not front the Wall Street bailout, and has a much better idea of how to run against Jerry Brown, I'm a better choice.A facetious choice, of course, to make a point.Not that I would ever campaign against Brown, who is merely the first person I ever voted for. Unless he was secretly leading the effort to establish a global surveillance state with the aim of launching a constantly orbiting fleet of ultra-tech gunships to immediately wipe out potential opponents to a new world order of fascism.Wait, that's from the plot of a movie.Hey, it wouldn't be the first time Robert Redford played a fictionalized version of Jerry Brown. You have seen The Candidate, haven't you?Meanwhile, Brown, sitting on a $20 million-plus campaign warchest, isn't running ads or sending direct mail in the primary. And he's not doing campaign events, either, though he may be doing a few more state events than usual. Maybe.What else is he up to? Well, he is working to put his version of a state rainy day fund on the November ballot and deciding whether or not to also go this fall for a revised version of the big state water bond that Schwarzenegger wrestled through the legislature a few years ago. And he made this year's Time 100, that august if more than a little quirky annual assemblage of the (very) arguably most influential people in the world. The article accompanying his selection is by none other than former Governor Gray Davis, who served Brown for seven years as Brown's extremely able chief of staff during his first go-round as governor. Davis, in a brief piece entitled ""The Turnaround Artist,"" plays up Brown's frugality with the story of Brown refusing to replace the old and increasingly threadbare carpeting in the Governor's Office inherited from the Reagan Administration. It's a good and telling story, though other stories might come to mind. Davis does lose out in the cheek sweepstakes to fellow Time 100 chronicler Harvey Weinstein. Dubbing Redford ""The Godfather of Indie Film,"" Weinstein recounts his recurring problem with Robert Redford, i.e., the film legend's amazing pattern of never being able to pick up the check for their lunches and dinners. After discussing Redford's great acting abilities, Weinstein goes on to recount the end of their most recent lunch, with Redford delivering an even better performance of searching for his missing wallet. Clearly his fee for the new Captain America movie -- in which Redford, hero of classic '70s conspiracy thrillers, stars as one of the most admirable people in the world -- will solve that problem.The problem of California Republicans might have been solved if they had listened to Schwarzenegger at their very fateful fall 2007 state convention outside Palm Springs. There, Schwarzenegger -- who's just begun making a time travel-oriented new Terminator picture with brilliant former Doctor Who star Matt Smith in the cast -- urged his fellow delegates to move the ever rightward-sliding state party back toward the center. As Schwarzenegger had, just the previous November, won a second landslide election as governor of California, you might think his words would carry a lot of weight. But even invoking St. Ronald of Reagan, who would be a liberal in today's GOP, availed him not, with delegates choosing the red meat rhetoric of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who followed Schwarzenegger on that Friday night in Indian Wells.By the next day it was clear to me where the state Republicans were going. It was clear to then state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner, too. Schwarzenegger brought him into state politics after Poizner ran a losing Assembly race in 2004. But Poizner, with his eye on the governorship, tacked hard to the right, anticipating the ideological gauntlet that he and Meg Whitman would ultimately run in 2010 as they sought the Republican nod for governor.I called Brown from the convention to get his thoughts on what I'd just seen and to offer my own. My take was that, if there was any doubt in the then California attorney general's mind about going again for the governorship, he should immediately dispense with that doubt. For the circumstances were turning in a way that could greatly advantage him as a candidate and give him the chance to make history.Now the Republicans are staring into an abyss, faced with a choice between an utterly unelectable extremist and, well, I'm looking to avoid a snappy description because I think Kashkari means well. The reality is that each of the potential Democratic candidates for governor in 2018 -- and I don't think that they are all publicly known yet -- has bigger potential problems overall than Jerry Brown had in the run-up to his re-emergence as governor. But will the Republicans still be viable enough as a political entity in California to offer up anyone of note?William Bradley Archive"
