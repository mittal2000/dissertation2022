According to the fan site Welcome to Twin Peaks, Lee said she received a call from Lynch on her way to the festival telling her that she and Ashbrook would appear in the new series. Ashbrook made the announcement during the festival, much to the fans' excitement, revealing that Sherilyn Fenn, who played Audrey Horne, may also be returning.Lee played both Laura, the murdered high school homecoming queen, and Laura's cousin Maddy Ferguson, in the original series, which ran for two seasons on ABC. It's unknown how Lee and Ashbrook will return to the new nine-episode season of the show, especially since it will take place 25 years later. During the panel, the two also revealed that they were just as surprised as the rest of us when co-creators Lynch and Mark Frost's tweeted about the show's return last October. This news should hardly come as a surprise though, since Laura did say she'd see us again in 2016.

However no imminent specific threat against Italy has yet been reported.""We have done everything necessary, within the limits of possibility, to guard against the threat,"" Alfano said, noting that the expulsions had started before the Paris attacks which began on Jan. 7 with the Charlie Hebdo shooting.""There have been nine expulsions.

The president claimed an array of successes in 2014, citing lower unemployment, a rising number of Americans covered by health insurance, and an historic diplomatic opening with Cuba. He also touts his own executive action and a Chinese agreement to combat global warming. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e4c7210000d601c969d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If President Obama talks about his Cuba policy on Tuesday night, his State of the Union Address could be unlike any our nation has experienced.Earlier presidents were colonizers; like William McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt, who used their State of the Union messages to justify intervening in Cuba, rewriting it's Constitution, controlling its internal affairs, and grabbing Guantanamo Bay as a coaling station for the Navy.In more recent times, Presidents Kennedy and Reagan spoke as anticommunists. With Kennedy asserting the Cold War right of the United States to prevent ""Communist domination in this Hemisphere,"" and Reagan promising ""those who would export terrorism and subversion in the Caribbean and elsewhere, especially Cuba and Libya, we will act with firmness."" But, the ideas embodied in those speeches lost their resonance long ago. Because his policy is not guided either by Manifest Destiny or the conditions of Cold War, President Obama can re-frame how his State of the Union speech addresses Cuba and the changes his reforms will bring.His policy re-imagines the role of government. Because the goal is sending more visitors to the island to exchange ideas with the Cuban people, the Obama policy reduces paperwork barriers to travel, and extracts the bureaucracy from deciding whether U.S. travelers should settle their hotel and bar bills using cash or credit cards. It is much more practical.Because the goal is boosting the access of Cubans to information, the policy says that it is no longer necessary to ask the Federal government for a license so travelers can bring thumb drives, laptops, or cellphones to Cuba as give Cubans the gifts of a thumb drive, a cellphone, or a laptop. It uses common sense.When the goal is promoting human rights, the Obama policy reached the obvious conclusion that it was the presence of diplomacy -- not its absence -- that would help persuade Cuba to release 53 political prisoners from its jails, and enable both countries to swap spies and bring Alan Gross back to his family and his home.It lays the groundwork for the future by bringing more of us into the process.What Obama has done -- which his predecessors didn't and somehow couldn't -- is to open a considerable amount of political space for actors other than government officials and public servants to do the hard but necessary work of bringing Cuba and the United States closer together. Many Cuban Americans have labored bravely for decades in a hostile environment in which the expression of moderate views was met by with disapproval -- in some cases with force -- by bullies and extremists. By changing the policy, the President has ensured that Cuban American families will be joined by pastors and rabbis, ball players and marine scientists, artists and experts, in conducting the kinds of meaningful exchanges that bring societies together in ways that diplomats (and certainly Beltway Contractors) cannot. As the coalition expands further to include the business community, farmers, businesses and individuals with legacy claims for compensation for property that was expropriated, and lots of others with reason to work on behalf of an open policy, the momentum favoring reform will increase substantially. Diplomacy remains essential -- as illustrated by the trip that Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson will undertake next week -- for the resumption of diplomatic relations, the opening of our two embassies, and the expression of our disagreements on human rights and political issues, and much more. We hope the President talks about these changes, as he should, but that he also prepares the public and the Congress for the road ahead. The two countries and the two publics cannot mend this historically broken relationship overnight. As our friend Rafael Hernandez has written, ""the main weakness Cuba needs to overcome is not its lesser physical power, but it's siege mentality. The United States, on the other hand, needs to overcome its sense of super power arrogance vis-à-vis a small neighbor. Most counterproductive policies on both sides, from the Bay of Pigs fiasco to Cuba's Internet restrictions, have been the consequence of these weaknesses."" Even on our best days, this will take time. The instinct to provoke -- by hardliners on both sides of the Florida Strait -- will remain and even grow more desperate, as the provocateurs increasingly find themselves living in a bygone age. Tuesday night offers the President a unique platform for giving power and voice to the new ways in which Cuba and the United States can engage with and relate to each other respectfully. If he says these things, it will be the first time in our history a President of the United States has given a State of the Union Address like that."

The port has had to close.Since the start of January, 34 people have been killed, most of them soldiers, and 23 wounded, hospital medics said.""The total death toll is around 600,"" one medic said, asking not to be named. One hospital had 71 bodies in its morgue which had not been claimed by relatives, he said.A Reuters reporter taken on tour by the army saw most parts of the city were controlled by special forces and allies loyal to former general Khalifa Haftar. Some districts had suffered heavy destruction from aircraft and artillery fire.""We control 90 percent of the city,"" said Mohamed El Hejazi, spokesman for Haftar and the army.Haftar have been using war planes to bomb Islamists in Benghazi. His opponents say he is backed by Egypt which is worried about the spread of militants. Haftar and Cairo deny this though analysts.

Both sides fight each other on several fronts.Libya has failed to build up a national army and efficient state institutions since Gaddafi's ousting as the country is effectively run by former rebel brigades who use their weapons to fight for control.Thinni is accusing Libya Dawn of relying on Islamist armed groups but has allied himself with Haftar, a Gaddafi-era officer commanding his own irregular forces.Haftar's forces have now become part of the official army in the east, a move analysts say might complicate building up state institutions as his own political goals are unclear.In a sign that Haftar's officers are increasingly dominating the army in the east, the House of Representatives appointed his air force commander Saqer al-Joroushi as the army's official air force head, he and lawmakers told Reuters.

RIP Faten Hamama,"" tweeted  Youssef El Deeb, CEO of Picture Pond Media and founder of Fatafeat TV. My reaction on hearing of Hamama's passing Saturday morning was to dig up pictures I shot when I interviewed her in 1985 and notes of the indelible impression this epitome of a lady left on me. First Lady of Arab cinema Faten Hamama (Abu-Fadil)I was visiting Cairo and a mutual friend arranged the meeting at Hamama's tastefully decorated penthouse apartment overlooking the Nile on the island of Zamalek. She was getting ready for an evening out with her third husband, radiologist Mohamed Abdel Wahab, and film director Henri Barakat. Film director Henri Barakat (Abu-Fadil)Recalling her start in cinema, she told me early actors came from well-to-do families and took part in all aspects of movie making -- acting, directing, and producing.""They were driven by the passion of it,"" almost to the point of being disowned by their families, who viewed movies with disdain, she said.Hamama's family, on the other hand, sought a career for her, and her teacher father, who had suppressed his own stage ambitions because of the stigma attached to it, transmitted his hopes to his daughter who appeared on film at age seven and was paid 10 Egyptian pounds ($1.40 in today's currency) for her first role. Screen shot of Faten Hamama whose career began at age sevenPart of the octogenarian's longevity in a career that included some television in later years and a bit of radio was that her on-screen portrayals mirrored contemporary societal concerns.She had evolved from light Cinderella-type characters to more substantive roles in the 1950s, broaching controversial themes of conscience and social obligation like rape, workers' rights, and society's treatment of divorced women.""Women then were invariably portrayed as passive, controlled by their fathers or husbands,"" Hamama told me.Her on-screen metamorphosis coincided with the change in the scope of women's activities in society at large. Film roles began to assume some depth when women were seen, for the first time, as multi-dimensional characters.But this new activism had its price and Hamama admitted to receiving hate mail from men who accused her of agitating their wives to the point that men lost control of their households. Screen shot of a 1964 French TV interview at a Beirut film festival The highly disciplined actress was noted for carefully picking her roles and demanding the highest professional standards from her co-workers. Punctuality was almost an obsession in a country where staying on schedule was impossible.After living for a while in the mid-1960s in Paris and London, she returned to Egypt in 1970 and acted regularly in Egypt's thriving film industry. She had married, and eventually divorced, Omar Sharif -- her second husband and father of her son Tarek -- whose career she helped launch, and with whom she co-starred in films before he went on to international stardom. Screen shot of Faten Hamama & Omar SharifOnly a handful of her 100-plus movies were box office failures. But even those became successful years later as TV reruns, videos, and DVDs.""It's hard to please everybody,"" she told me of her abundant film heritage that prompted requests for the movies from Europe and North America. ""Some people even have whole libraries of them, which I haven't bothered to assemble.""Hamama was involved in shaping the movies in which she appeared from early on, never afraid to voice strong opinions about her scripts and production questions in general.""But that's a relationship built on trust,"" she noted. ""I share my views with the scriptwriter and director in a very friendly and informal setting. However, I've been known to make comments during the filming as well.""Once, an actress portraying her sister, cast as the impoverished mother of nine, appeared on the set clad in a beautiful new dress -- a far cry from what would be realistic, given the economic circumstances of the character.""I pointed out that discrepancy to her and she graciously accepted the criticism,"" Hamama said.Garbed in a more appropriate costume, the woman went on to win an award and critical acclaim for the realism of her role.On a more personal level, Faten Hamama insisted on roles she considered suitable for a woman of a certain age and was known to frown on nudity. She was already in her fifties when I interviewed her.""It's just not acceptable in the Middle East,"" she told me. ""Even Ingrid Bergman admitted to being 'old fashioned' and wouldn't agree to nudity. There are limits."" Contact sheet of my interview pictures of Faten HamamaIn The Night of Fatma's Arrest, she played a woman over a period of 35 years and found she had to overcome vanity and an initial reluctance but went on to render a superb and convincing performance, including on close-ups.She was used to hectic shooting schedules -- eight hours on average, plus two for make up and costume fitting. Some days were longer, when actors and directors wanted to sustain a given mood. She also usually filmed without a double.But juggling schedules once backfired when she collapsed from exhaustion after shuttling back and forth between two separate films while preparing for a third.I first met Faten Hamama in the 1960s when I spent some vacations at the summer home of family friends in Agamy (then a sleepy, dusty but up-and-coming resort near Alexandria that attracted a few stars, foreign expats, and some Egyptians).The friends' place was a couple of houses away from Hamama's villa where she and her daughter Nadia - from first husband director Ezzedine Zulfikar whom she divorced - also spent time off. I was the kid on the block who was in awe of this very famous person and tagged along with Nadia and my friend Djihan, both older, for walks on the beach. They were memorable days."

Violence is always a product of ignorance in that way. Ray thought he silenced a dangerous radical. Instead, he elevated King's voice beyond its already historic dimensions. Dr. King became a martyr for peace, justice and equality. Did his life and death truly change social conditions in the United States? Or, were the federal laws associated with the Civil Rights Movement only window dressing, disguising fundamental inequalities that remain intransigent?In 1950, most African American families in Montgomery, Ala., lived on less than $30 a week (not adjusted for inflation). Even the people who resisted King and the movement in Alabama only made approximately $100 a week. It took a full century for the South to effectively abandon its history of dependence on rural agriculture. Only the dominance of the Democratic Party in the Senate provided the federal funding necessary to make southern cities like Charlotte, Atlanta, Houston and Dallas thrive.Dr. King was fundamentally concerned with improving the economic stability of African American families. The landmark civil rights laws in 1964, 1965 and 1968 were not solely about access, representation, voting and housing. Their explicit goals included equity in wages, education, skills and business ownership. However, the underlying mechanisms of real economic inequality did not change. By 1980, black families in Alabama earned almost $80 a week (not adjusted for inflation), compared to approximately $150 for white families. Nationwide, where black households rarely earned 35 percent of the median white household before 1950, Dr. King created an America where this percentage rose to nearly 60 percent after 1980.This income growth occurred because African Americans became more mobile with the protection of the federal government. African American professionals relied on careers in government after 1970. Every effort to reduce the size of government had a disproportionate, negative impact for African American families. Resurrecting Dr. King is the work of replicating his economic achievements for all people. Where his leadership created a leap in family income for African Americans nationwide, today's activists must close rifts of income and wealth on a global scale. Just as mobility was a key in the 20th century, it remains a central factor today. Working and poor families must move effectively and often to increase their earnings and their chances to build commercial equity. Academics and public advocates have crucial voices in this process, too. In April, Monmouth University will host a conference on race and crime to showcase research on restoring the human capital lost to the prison-industrial complex. In September, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH) will use its centennial celebration to explore racial disparities around the world. Finally, in November, the Society for American City and Regional Planning History (SACRPH) will examine the ways that the law functioned to preserve economic barriers through architecture.Where James Earl Ray was reckless, these organizations are thoughtful. Their combined efforts will be the start of King's rebirth -- a century in pursuit of economic justice for all.--Dr. Walter Greason, a professor at Monmouth University (N.J.) in the Department of History and Anthropology, founded the International Center for Metropolitan Growth (ICMG_International Center for Metropolitan Growth).

I log on every day. I like things. I comment and interact with friends and family, near and far. Admittedly, I ""lose"" hours to Facebook every week. I wont justify or explain; it is what it has become. I see many wonderful advantages to Facebook and have felt grateful for the opportunity to connect, on some level, with many people who I might not see for long periods of time, and who- if left to letter writing and phone calls, I might lose touch with altogether -- friends and family alike. It's a reality of busy lives, geography and changing social norms.Take my high school graduation class: These are people I grew up with, but admittedly, many of them, I hardly knew then. We were kids, living in that adolescent haze that we only recognized as blurred, much later in life. Prior to Facebook, I attended two high school reunions, and honestly, I left feeling disconnected and disappointed. I moved away from my hometown a long time ago. My childhood and youth were fraught with struggles that made me feel separate and isolated from the frivolity and social themes I saw around me in high school. I was busy trying to look normal, each day when I left my troubled home. While I knew that my mother was doing her best, I also knew her best wasn't something I wanted to share with others. So, I covered well and tried to fit into a world I believed was better than mine. At reunions, honestly, I just came back and felt just as outside the box, as I had at 12, 15, 17 and 18. That was even more disconcerting, as I aged and knew that I didn't need to put myself in those situations anymore.(In 1981, this girl was a little lost and clueless...)I was fairly set on not attending another one, unwilling to travel so far to leave feeling empty again. Then, just before our 30th reunion, someone started a Facebook page -- and an entire world of good people opened up to me. As former classmates greeted each other on our private FB wall, as they shared their family pictures, their status updates, their joys and challenges-- the walls came down. I saw that much of what I'd thought I'd known about people, in our youth, was just as fictional as my own story. Many of us had felt out of a box that never really existed. Classmates were bullied, were gay, were insecure, were happy and unhappy; some were losing parents to divorce and early deaths, or struggling to fit in and look normal... just like I was. We each had our own stories, and few of us really knew how many other stories were happening around us. We knew surface. However, at nearly 50, on our new Facebook wall, the need to appear any certain way melted, and I saw good people who I might connect with in new ways. Because of the connections we made on Facebook beforehand, our 30th reunion was a fantastic weekend of really connecting with each other. These people know from whence I come, and because of FB, went into the weekend with a clearer idea of who I am now, and that made the rest buttercream icing.(While the woman she became, danced and enjoyed the connections)Yet, for each reason I can give for being grateful to Facebook, I also struggle- mightily sometimes, with the downside. As someone ""who came of age"" at a time when we memorized phone numbers and called people, wrote letters, visited- it comes down to this: I just don't get how real, meaningful connection too often take a back seat to Facebook's easy ""Likes"" and false sense of meaning and connectivity. I don't get it. And herein is my struggle: I believe in connection; it is central to who I am and how I live my life. Admittedly, my connection may not appeal to everyone, and I am certainly old enough to understand that one can only sustain so many real ties. We're not all meant to be friends; OK, I accept that.However, take real life... the life that unfolds on a deeper level, and I believe, is not enhanced by Facebook. I have far more friends on Facebook than I have in real life, but what do I mean to most of them? People meet you at a conference, or a party, or the grocery store, and they friend you on FB. It's hard to decline. As a blogger, I get requests from folks who have only read my writing. What are they seeking? What should I offer? That's why I have a FB page for my blog- that's where those friendships should live. Others have gotten to know me through my writing and have reached out to know me better. I appreciate their interest, but I am not my blog; I am not everything I write. Yet, in some cases, Facebook allows us to share those same family photos, goals and adventures, and get to know each other.But should family and friends -- real connections, rely on Facebook to maintain connectivity? No. If we cannot share a real phone call, a lunch or coffee, or an occasional meeting face to face- where we share some reality, why do you need to like my new haircut, or birthday celebration, etc... on Facebook? If you can't call me to say you want my advice, or like my taste in restaurants, doctors, movies- if you don't really want to spend time with me in person, how is it ok to write to me on Facebook and ask me to do you a favor? If you chat with me online, and play words with friends/games, ""chat,"" socialize- but wouldn't include me in a flesh and bones get together, that you know I'd like, why make the effort on-line? If I call you and try to share real-time, and you can't reciprocate, why be my Facebook friend at all? What's the point? That blurring of reality and cyber can feel so shallow.(Who is this person, versus the one writing this post? I am sure that I don't actually have 477 friends!)I get that the ability to watch each other's lives unfold on Facebook can be fun and sometimes the most realistic way for friends and family, who live far away or live busy lives, to keep up and share things sometimes. But it can also be a very superficial way to think you are connecting, when in fact it's as empty and meaningless as reading the news and thinking you get what people in the stories are feeling. I am so much more than the happy birthday greetings, the photos of fun times, the news of events that I post on Facebook. My feelings are hurt when I try to connect with people- reach out to say: hey, let's have lunch; let's go birding; I'd love to join you- and you don't respond... but hit like on a FB posting. My feelings are hurt when I call you, and you don't call back or acknowledge the vulnerability that goes into trying to reach out for real, but you like my photos and leave your mysterious imprint on my Facebook wall. Some days, the imprints- those cyber footprints are haunting... why were you there? What do I mean to you? Or, is it only my Facebook image that you like?Facebook has become a double-edged sword that is a major presence in our day-to-day world. Zuckerberg and his buddies have determined that we need to know when someone has ""seen"" something we posted; that we can be liked for things as widely different as our daily run or the birth of a child. If you're on FB, you are constantly reminded that people you know are there, looking at something you wrote, or posted- but not necessarily connecting with you. People can avoid you in real life, but still let you know that they like your outfit, or just looked at something you posted (""Seen by 10 people,"" but who, and why?), and then retreat to the background again.Where does that leave us in 2015, in regards to relationships? Are we destined to become more and more dependent on sound bytes, hit and run likes and comments, to show our feelings? If you haven't been kind to me in person, but are nice online, should I give you the benefit of the doubt and visa versa? I'm just as guilty of drive by affection as the next person, but these things creep into my thoughts regularly, and trouble me. I struggle to know who do I invite to a party, based on real life versus Facebook ties, and what does a given person feel about me in real-time versus the way they Like me online? These things keep me up at night, trying to come to terms with reality versus the Facebook bed our culture has made- and in which I find it hard to sleep.Share your thoughts in the comments, and if you haven't already, stop by my Facebook page... and hit Like. Yes, I'm ironic that way. Read more of my writing on Tales From the Motherland, follow me on Twitter (where I'm forced to be brief) and Facebook.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Here are seven reasons we admire him:1. He was the real star of ""The Big Chill,"" even if we didn't see him. Costner played the character Alex, around whose funeral the 30-somethings gather for the weekend. Unfortunately for Costner, all his scenes were cut from the final movie. His career, of course, didn't die on the cutting room floor. He went on to win two Academy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and one Emmy. Not bad for a corpse, we'd say.2. He moved past ""Waterworld"" (1995) and ""The Postman"" (1997). Both were financial disappointments and pretty much got dissed by everyone. But the point is, he survived the scathing reviews, the ribbing on Saturday Night Live, and moved on. He inspires us with his resiliency -- and apparently we are not alone. He has two films on the American Film Institute's 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time list -- ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990) and ""Field of Dreams (1989).""3. He doesn't just act and direct -- he's also a country music crooner. Costner sings in a country rock band he formed called Kevin Costner & Modern West. They did a world tour in 2007 that included shows in Istanbul and Rome and released an album in 2008 called ""Untold Truths.""4. He loves baseball. Costner has made multiple movies with a baseball theme and we've loved them all: ""Chasing Dreams,"" ""Bull Durham,"" ""Field of Dreams,"" ""For Love of the Game"" and ""The Upside of Anger,"" where he plays a former pro-ball player. Costner has a house in Austin and sometimes shows up at Texas Longhorns baseball practices and games.5. He loves Westerns. And since John Wayne is gone, who else even tries to make one anymore?6. He has perfected the scruffy beard look. While others have tried, nobody but nobody in our book wears a 5 o'clock shadow the way Costner does. He has elevated it to an art form.7. By all accounts, he's a good dad. While we aren't one of his seven children, we do like how he talked about his kids and fatherhood when we caught up with him."
11,ENTERTAINMENT,Andraé Crouch: An Artist for the Ages,"Mark Joseph, ContributorProducer, author and publisher of Bullypulpit.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andrae-crouch-an-artist-f_b_6483218.html,"""Now he belongs to the ages,"" was my first thought when I got the call that my friend Andraé Crouch had succumbed to the heart attack that felled him the week before. As grandiose as it may sound, he was a musical giant who may one day be fully appreciated in death in ways that sometimes eluded him in life.",2015-01-18,2015-01-16-150111andrae_crouch03_f53e9e484501d68daed7ae27dc1126d5.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-01-16-150111andrae_crouch03_f53e9e484501d68daed7ae27dc1126d5-thumb.jpg,"""Now he belongs to the ages,"" was my first thought when I got the call that my friend Andraé Crouch had succumbed to the heart attack that felled him the week before. That most famous epitaph in history originally belonged to Edwin Stanton describing the passing of Abraham Lincoln and as grandiose as it may sound, in musical terms, Crouch'a passing is on par with Lincoln's, for he was a musical giant who may one day be fully appreciated in death in ways that sometimes eluded him in life.  There are reasons his musical genius may not have been understood in his lifetime and one of them is no doubt the genre in which he operated for most of his career, Gospel, as well as the fact that he never hesitated to take a pass on participating in projects that he felt would compromise his beliefs.  No less an icon than Madonna found this out the hard way when in 1988 at the peak of her fame, she turned to Crouch for help on a song ""Like A Prayer,"" and Crouch and his choir obliged with a command performance that gave the song power, emotion and depth. But when she sang ""let the choir sing"" leading into Crouch's performance, she likely had no clue that he would later politely decline when it came time to film the video for the track. The reason: Madonna had chosen to take the video in a different direction than the song and Crouch wanting no part of a video that sexualized images of saints who came to life, left Madonna no choice but to dress others up in choir robes and have them do their best Milli Vanilli. As he told me matter-of-factly years later, ""the video was something I didn't believe in.""  ""What did she say?"" I prodded.  ""She said, 'I understand,'"" he replied.  Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone, indeed.  Crouch recalled the story without a hint of bitterness or disappointment, but one can only imagine the limitations that would naturally follow for an artist who was willing to walk away from career-making opportunities like that one and they no doubt affected his ability to reach a mass audience beyond the Gospel genre.  There's also the fact that when we think of great singer/songwriters it is rock/pop artists like Billy Joel, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, John and Paul and Taupin and Elton that come to mind and not Gospel artists.  But a strong case can be made that Crouch belongs in that select group of singer/songwriters for the combination of his vocal performance, raw songwriting talent and piano playing. Crouch was an imaginative songwriter whose lyrics were unusually personal, and he was fond of quoting others talking to him (""they say Andraé how can you have a song when everything is going wrong""), imagining how God talked to his arch-nemesis, (""they're gonna keep on living for me Satan, they're not gonna turn around,"") quoting Old Scratch talking to him (""Satan tried to tell me 'Andraé why don't you just throw in the towel,'"") and even imagining how his mother talked to God (""I heard her say 'help Andraé , Lord Jesus, keep him close to your heart."")There was also his trailblazing work in bringing sounds that traditionally appealed primarily to African-Americans, to a white audience, for while mainstream audiences in the '50's needed the likes of Elvis and Pat Boone to bring R&B rhythms to them, Crouch needed no such translators and was warmly received by white audiences for most of his career. But, it's important to note, that didn't just happen, for Crouch carefully and methodically wooed white audiences, he later recalled:  ""My Father had told me 'Andraé a lot of people don't like black Gospel music because they think they can't understand the words.' So he said, 'Why don't you always give people two chances to hear what you're saying, to understand what you're saying.' So when we would sing 'through it all,' I'd go 'through it all through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus, oh I've learned to trust in God.' And when you do that they'll catch one of them,"" Crouch added with a laugh.  And just as his Father predicted, white audiences adored Crouch's music and many of his songs like the first song he ever wrote at the age of 14, ""The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power,"" along with others like ""My Tribute,"" are still sung in churches across the country today.  But as the title of his first album Take The Message Everywhere, would hint at, Crouch's early music with its strong soul and occasional funk elements was begging to be liberated from the four walls of the church and even in his early days he was clearly paying attention to what was happening outside of the Gospel world. Seven years after the Rolling Stones first expressed the complaints of a generation fed up with various social ills in ""I Can't Get No Satisfaction,"" Crouch offered a soul/funk response with ""Satisfied,"" declaring that he was ""Satisfied with Jesus.""But beginning in 1979 he began a serious attempt to take his music into the musical mainstream with a record entitled ""I'll Be Thinking Of You,"" which was distributed by Elektra and featured an all-star cast of players that included Stevie Wonder, Philip Bailey of Earth, Wind & Fire, Joe Sample and others.In 1981, Crouch took his mainstream moves to the next level, signing with Warner Brothers and releasing ""Don't' Give Up,"" with another cast of all-star musical talent that included members of Toto, and The Brothers Johnson. Despite his new label home, Crouch could hardly be accused of toning down his message, beginning the record with the smooth ""Waiting For The Son,"" the urgent Gospel message of ""I Can't Keep It To Myself,"" the spiritual ""I Love Walking With You,"" and even an anti-abortion number, ""I'll Be Good To You Baby"" which in case the message was missed was subtitled ""A Message To The Silent Victims.""Not everybody in the church world was supportive however and in successive years Crouch transitioned to working on films like The Color Purple, The Lion King, Free Willy and others performed background vocals for the likes of Michael Jackson and Madonna and released sporadic comeback albums that never quite reached the heights of his work in the '70s and early '80s. When his parents and brother passed away, Crouch took on the additional responsibilities of pastoring his family's church and would spend the last two decades of his life leading New Christ Memorial Church where he could be found most Sundays singing and leading the services with this twin sister Sandra, who was faithfully by his side throughout his career.  Mainstream critics who have long ignored Crouch will have plenty of time to re-evaluate his work and the contributions he made not just to the bridging of the chasm that has, thanks to the likes of Sam Cooke, Robert Johnson and others, separated Gospel from the rest of the music industry, but also to the uniting of the races, black white, yellow and brown who all found something in his music (Crouch regularly toured Europe and had a following in Asia.)  But Andraé Crouch the artist may for some remain something of an enigma for he came to his craft with little in the way of formal training, insisting that his musical gifts came from God and only after his father had laid hands on his son and asked that musical talent be divinely given to him, and for the purpose of spreading the Gospel message. Crouch took that charge seriously:""For me that's what it's all about. We're here to win souls,"" he once told me. ""When he uses me to win the last one, I'm out of here. Until then, all you're going to hear from us is how can we win that person to Jesus Christ. I don't even want to think I know a person that went to hell. I don't even want to think that our paths crossed and they ended up in hell.""  In 1975, with his tried and true method of repeating himself to make sure nobody missed his message, Crouch laid out his vision of what he might one day consider a successful life in the song, ""I'll Still Love You:"" Even when the cold winds blow, dear Lord I want you to know, I'll still love you Lord, I'll still love you. Even if I stumble and fall, my friends don't answer my call, even if I never reach fame and people don't remember my name, even when I'm old and gray and find it hard to see my way, I'll still love you, Lord I'll still love you."
12,MEDIA,"Univision, Biggest Spanish-Language Network, Shut Out Of Republican 2016 Debates",Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/univision-republican_n_6489898.html,,2015-01-17,"In this Dec. 14, 2011 photo, Univision newscaster Jorge Ramos works in the studio in Miami, Florida. Ramos is anchors one of the most watched news shows in Spanish the U.S. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c3da3c000018010d06e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- The Republican National Committee announced Friday which networks landed 2016 presidential debates -- and Univision, the most-watched Spanish-language network, didn't make the cut. How Republicans engage with Univision this election cycle is being closely watched given that the network reaches 96 percent of Hispanic households, a key demographic for either party hoping to win the White House. On Wednesday, BuzzFeed’s Adrian Carrasquillo described Univision, which has aggressively covered immigration reform, as “one of the Republican Party’s biggest, most complex, most painful challenges.”In a statement to The Huffington Post, Univision spokesman Jose Zamora didn't specifically address the Republican Party's decision, but spoke broadly of the need for both parties to engage the network's large audience. ""There is a very simple political reality -- Hispanics will decide the 2016 presidential election,"" Zamora said. ""No one can match Univision’s reach and ability to inform, provide access and empower Hispanic America. Anyone who wants to reach and engage Hispanics will have to do it through Univision. The Hispanic community deserves to hear the policies and views of all political parties and Univision is committed to providing access to all points of view. We have an open invitation to all political parties to address our community on issues of importance and relevance. Candidates should not miss the opportunity to inform and engage with the fastest growing segment of the electorate.""Jorge Ramos, the top anchor on Univision and Fusion, an English-language network launched through a partnership with ABC, said in a statement that both Republicans and Democrats ""have to make sure that their debates don’t look like the 2015 Oscar nominations,” a reference to the lack of diversity among Academy Award nominees. “The new rule in American politics is that no one can make it to the White House without the Hispanic vote,” Ramos continued. “So we still expect all candidates from both parties to talk to us on Univision and Fusion. I believe that Latinos and Millennials will decide the 2016 presidential election. The sooner Republicans and Democrats realize this, the better their chances to win the White House. It’s always a strategic mistake not to include in your plans the fastest growing segments of the electorate.”NBC and Telemundo (the second-biggest Spanish-language network, owned by NBCUniversal) will partner on a Republican debate in Florida in February. The other networks selected were Fox News, Fox Business, CNBC, ABC and CBS. An RNC spokesman declined to comment on the decision. But clearly some in the party don't feel the network has treated them well. RNC chairman Reince Preibus told BuzzFeed earlier this week “it’s highly questionable whether we’re treated fairly on Univision.”Still, Preibus and others do engage with Ramos, an immigration reform advocate. The two sparred earlier this week over the Republican Party’s position on the issue. And Priebus will also appear Sunday on Univison’s “Al Punto,” a public affairs show hosted by Ramos. While immigration may be the biggest hurdle for Republicans in engaging with Univision this cycle, there also appear to be concerns about the network given that part-owner Haim Saban is a prominent Hillary Clinton supporter. Univision wasn't the only network shut out of the Republicans debate schedule, with liberal cable network MSNBC and Bloomberg TV also not getting selected. The difference, however, is that Republicans aren't looking to reach MSNBC's viewership, and the two business networks selected, CNBC and Fox Business, reach larger audiences than Bloomberg. "

But at this point we know very few details.",2015-01-17,"WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 16: U.S. President Barack Obama holds a press conference at the East Room of the White House January 16, 2015 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Erkan Avci/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5babe51a250000cf00375291.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am not writing this blog as a Republican or a Democrat. I am writing as an educator: as someone who has been a college classroom instructor, a development officer (fundraising) for a community college, the president of a private two-year not-for-profit college, and as the president of a two-year for-profit college. Hopefully, my professional experience qualifies me to write about the framework on which education in two-year colleges is built and to sort through the details of President Obama's recent proposal to provide tuition-free education for all students attending our country's community colleges. First of all, exactly what is a ""community college""? In the United States, a community college gets its name from its cliental: primarily members of the local community or surrounding area. Community colleges are like most other two year colleges; they offer classes leading to certificates, diplomas, and associate degrees. Another factor leading to their name is the fact that most community colleges are substantially funded by local, county, and state taxes, as well as by tuition that is much lower than at nearly all other colleges. There are also private not-for-profit two year colleges and private for-profit two-year colleges, which, because they are private institutions, are not funded by public taxes and are not called ""community"" colleges. Not-for-profit, or non-profit colleges as they are more frequently called, exist solely for the purpose of providing education, not for making money, and people and corporations that contribute to them receive income tax deductions for their contributions. Most colleges, two- and four-year, are non-profit colleges. They primarily are funded by tuition and fees, tax-deductible contributions from individuals and corporations, grants from foundations and corporations, and government grants they qualify for. There are some colleges, two- and four-year, however, that exist for a dual purpose -- providing education and making a profit. For-profit colleges, or proprietary or career colleges as they are frequently called, primarily are funded by tuition and fees, and occasionally they qualify for government grants. There are no tax deductions for contributions made to for-profit colleges. Students attending any two-year college (community college, private non-profit college, or private for-profit college) are eligible for federal funds that are paid directly to the students, not to the college. They consist of Pell Grants, which do not have to be paid back; Student Work Study, which does not have to be paid back; and Guaranteed Student Loans, which do have to be paid back. The same government criteria to qualify for such funds are used regardless of the college a student is attending. How much does it cost to attend community colleges? The national average of tuition and fees for community colleges published for 2014-2015 is $3,347. The cost of attending community colleges varies greatly from state to state, with the average cost of tuition in California being the lowest at $1,429, and the average cost of tuition in Vermont being the highest at $7,320, which is unusually high for community colleges. There are also other costs, such as books, supplies, food, housing, laundry, dry cleaning, and travel. Since community colleges primarily serve members of the local community, most community colleges do not have residence halls; the average student already has a place to live. But students not living at home still have to pay for their accommodations and food. The total average cost for a student not living at home to attend a community college is estimated by educational authorities to be about $16,325 per year: $3,347 for tuition, $1,328 for books and supplies, $1,735 for transportation, $2,210 for miscellaneous expenses, and $7,705 for housing and food. Most students attending a community college have part-time jobs during the school year and full-time employment during the summer vacation, which give them additional funds. Federal financial aid available to students attending community college -- Pell Grants, Work Study, and Guaranteed Student Loans -- also assists in defraying the cost of attending. With the grant money already available for students, critics of President Obama's plan to offer tuition-free education at community colleges say it seems unnecessary. On the other hand, the amount of grant money a student receives depends on, among other things, one's financial need and the costs of the particular educational institution the student is attending. Hence, some students may not qualify for federal grants.The President has introduced only the grand idea of providing tuition-free education for all students attending community colleges, an idea which, at first glance, seems to have great merit. But at this point we know very few details. White House staff tells us that the President will formally introduce this proposal during his State of the Union Address this coming Tuesday, January 20. Maybe we will learn more details at that time. But even if we do learn some of the details, it is assumed that the President will leave the final writing of the bill to White House staff members, the Department of Education, and law makers. And as was demonstrated by the Affordable Care Act (Obama Care), the final details may not be what the President foresaw (for example, being able to keep your same doctors and your same medical insurance plans and that your insurance would be less expensive). So details are important, and at this point in time people are only able to speculate on what the plan would really look like when finalized.This week's column is meant to be a general introduction to the idea of providing all students attending community college with more government-funded financial assistance that does not have to be repaid by the students. Next week, I will dig deeper into the details, try to answer such questions as where the money to pay for this program would come from, and minuses and pluses of the program for education in general, and update you on any recent developments.   (Sources for statistical information is from several issues of The Chronicle of Higher Education published last week and numerous reports from the U. S. Department of Education.)"

At least 1,000 youths assembled at the grand mosque in the capital Niamey, some of them throwing rocks at police while others burned tyres and chanted 'Allahu Akbar' ('God is Greatest'). The protest came a day after a policeman and three civilians were killed and 45 injured in protests against Charlie Hebdo in Niger's second city of Zinder, which saw three churches ransacked and the French cultural centre burned down.

A police station was attacked and at least two police cars burned.""They offended our Prophet Mohammad, that's what we didn't like,"" said Amadou Abdoul Ouahab, who took part in the demonstrations.President Mahamadou Issoufou said all five of the dead were civilians, with four of them killed inside burned churches or bars. He said an enquiry would be opened and those responsible for organizing the violence would be punished.""Those who pillage religious sites and profane them, those who persecute and kill their Christian compatriots or foreigners who live on our soil, have understood nothing of Islam,"" he said in a televised address.The president added, however, that he shared the disgust of Muslims who felt offended by the caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad and that freedom of expression should not mean liberty to insult religious beliefs.Issoufou joined a march in Paris last weekend alongside French President Francois Hollande, in the wake of a gun attack that killed 12 people at the offices of satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, which had angered many Muslims by printing cartoons of Mohammad in the past.But Issoufou said on Saturday he had wanted to demonstrate his opposition to terrorism and not support for the newspaper itself.Calm returned to the streets of Niamey on Saturday afternoon but a demonstration called for on Sunday by opposition groups could revive the tension. Authorities on Saturday banned the march but opposition leaders said they would proceed anyway.Demonstrations were also reported in regional towns, including Maradi, 600 km (375 miles) east of Niamey, where two churches were burned. Another church and a residence of the foreign minister were burned in the eastern town of Goure.Niger's 17 million people are almost all Muslims, though its government remains secular.With the influence of moderate Sufi brotherhoods, Niger has avoided the armed Islamist uprisings that have shaken neighboring Nigeria and Mali, but there have been growing protests by hardline Muslim associations over social issues.The attack by two gunmen on Charlie Hebdo's offices in Paris sparked massive demand for the next issue of the weekly, which put an image of the Prophet on its front page to mark the bloodbath.That again outraged many in the Muslim world, triggering violent demonstrations in Algeria, Niger and Pakistan on Friday.French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius condemned the violence in Niger, a former French colony in West Africa where it stations troops as part of a regional counter-terrorism operation. ""France expresses its solidarity with the authorities in Niger,"" he said.Four Muslim preachers who had convened the meeting in Niamey were arrested, police sources said. The French embassy warned its citizens not to go out on the streets.The death toll from Friday's clashes in Niger's second largest city of Zinder rose to five after emergency services discovered a burned body inside a Catholic Church.Residents said churches were burned, Christian homes looted and the French cultural center attacked. A police officer and three civilians had already been confirmed killed in the demonstrations, police sources said.Peaceful marches took place after Friday prayers in the capitals of other West African countries, Mali, Senegal and Mauritania, and in Algeria in North Africa, all former French colonies. In Algiers, several police were injured in clashes with protesters.

After using an analogy in a recent Time Out New York interview that compared Bill Cosby to the Holocaust, the star took to Instagram to express her regret. Dunham made the remark while discussing criticism Judd Apatow has received for his outspoken stance against Cosby in the wake of recent sexual allegations, with ""Black-ish"" creator Kenya Barris calling Apatow ""obsessive.""It’s sort of like saying someone’s obsessed with the Holocaust.

We can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, for example, to reduce the damage and risk from producing, shipping and burning these fuels. How? First, by investing in efficiency, so we can do more with less waste and make our economy more productive. We can expand consumer options for hybrid and all-electric cars, and power them with more electricity from the wind and sun. And we can clean up our dirty power plants.We're making progress on all fronts, and the president will likely talk Tuesday about how we can build on those gains going forward.In Washington, though, the greatest threat to our environment is the big polluter agenda being pushed by the Republican leadership in Congress. Fresh off an election cycle during which fossil fuel interests spent more than $720 million to advance their candidates and agenda in the U.S. Congress, the new GOP majority has launched a broadside against the common sense safeguards we all depend on to protect our water, air, wildlife and lands.The GOP agenda is almost entirely about blocking action, not proposing solutions.Already in the GOP crosshairs: the Clean Power Plan itself. Even as the Environmental Protection Agency works with states, power companies, public service commissions and other stakeholders to find the most cost-effective way to cut carbon pollution, Republican leaders in the Senate and House have vowed to block the plan. It's one thing to offer an alternative, but that's not what's happening here. The Republicans aren't offering solutions. Their plan for climate change is to do nothing at all about it, a formula mirrored in their approach to smog, wildlife protection and safeguarding our drinking water.They've teed up legislation aimed at forcing approval of the Keystone XL dirty tar sands pipeline - before the president can even decide whether it's in the national interest. (It's not.)Just the past week, the GOP-led House passed the so-called Regulatory Accountability Act, a bill that would cripple federal efforts to provide responsible public oversight that protects all Americans, not only from environmental damage and threats, but from an array of risks ranging from workplace dangers and consumer fraud to shady banks and contaminated food.But hey, why stop there? Newly-elected Sen. Joni Ernst, R-IA., has called for the EPA to be abolished altogether. Hardly a fringe player, Ernst has been tapped by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY., to deliver her party's rebuttal to the president's State of the Union address on Tuesday.The threat is serious. House Republicans have taken more than 500 anti-environmental votes over just the past four years. Most died in the Senate. With this party in control of both houses, they've vowed to make bad votes stick.Republicans say it's about jobs. Nonsense. In 2012 - the last year for which such data are available - nearly 1.3 million Americans lost their jobs in what the Bureau of Labor Statistics terms a mass layoff - at least 50 workers idled for 30 days or more. Of those, government regulations and interventions, of all types, accounted for 3,300 - or 0.26 percent of the total - according to the companies that did the actual firings.The GOP-led legislative assault on the American environment is not about jobs. It's about putting polluter profits first - and putting the rest of us at risk.Americans don't want to anchor our future in the fossil fuels of the past. By broad majorities, we want to invest in the clean energy solutions of tomorrow.Six out of ten, in fact, say we should reduce our reliance on coal over the next ten years; 59 percent say it's wrong to block efforts to cut carbon pollution from our power plants; 57 percent say we're doing too little, as a nation, to promote the development of wind turbines, solar facilities and other sources of renewable power; and 49 percent say we're not doing enough to fight climate change.Those are the findings of a poll released Jan. 15 by the Center for American Progress and the respected polling outfit Hart Research Associates, which queried 1,101 adults nationwide.Whatever we said, as a nation, when we went to the polls last November, we didn't send anyone to Washington to fight for dirty air, contaminated lands and water that's unsafe to drink.The fact is all of us depend on healthy natural systems for our prosperity, our progress, our very existence. The state of those systems is imperiled. We need our political leaders in Washington to help create a more promising future for our children, not put it at greater risk."

It's because the statute was not intended to apply to these situations,"" said Debora Kristensen, an attorney for Givens Pursley, a law firm that represented Cow Palace.Kristensen said Cow Palace has already entered into a voluntary agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which enforces the act, to address water contamination concerns.Fertilizer is not considered waste under the act, but the district court found that Cow Palace was applying more manure to crops than needed. In one instance, the plaintiffs in the case said Cow Palace applied more than 7 million gallons (26 million liters) of manure to an already ""sufficiently fertilized field.""The district court said Cow Palace's excessive application transformed the waste, which is ""an otherwise beneficial and useful product,"" into a discarded material.The court found that Cow Palace's management of its manure violated the ""open dumping"" provisions of law.Unlike other federal contamination laws, the act requires violators not only to stop polluting, but to clean up any damage it has caused.The case is Community Association For Restoration Of The Environment, Inc. et al v.

Lerman previously represented the late Rodney King, a black motorist whose beating by police two decades ago sparked riots after a jury acquitted the officers of assault and other charges.But an investigation has not revealed the two officers who shot Ford recognized him when they approached him that day, said Los Angeles police spokesman Lieutenant Andy Neiman.Police have said Officer Sharlton Wampler and Officer Antonio Villegas shot Ford after he struggled with one of them and tried to grab that officer's holstered gun. Wampler is Asian-American and Villegas is Latino, police said.In 2008, Wampler arrested Ford for marijuana possession, but it is understandable he would not have recognized him six years later, Neiman said.""People change, a lot happens. I don't think it's that unusual that someone wouldn't recognize somebody,"" Neiman said.Ford's death came just two days after the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, which gained international attention that intensified after a grand jury declined to charge the officer.Ford's death touched off demonstrations outside Los Angeles police headquarters.The Los Angeles Times, which obtained a police report in Ford's marijuana possession arrest, said Wampler and his patrol partner in 2008 approached a car because they smelled pot. They discovered marijuana and also arrested Ford's father and his brother at the scene, the paper reported.Ford was later convicted of drug possession and sentenced to 180 days in jail and three years probation, according to the paper.

The PYD (the political wing of the YPG) arrested 10 soldiers and Baath party gunmen,"" Observatory head Rami Abdulrahman told Reuters.""There is now fighting in many areas of Hassakeh.""The YPG and the government had divided Hassakeh into zones in a power sharing agreement, the Observatory said.The army shelled three Kurdish-majority areas on the edges of Hassakeh city, and fighters from YPG clashed with Syrian forces inside the city throughout the day, the YPG said on its website.Syrian Kurds, who say they suffered years of marginalization under Assad, had on occasion fought with the president's loyalists in territorial disputes, but never in sustained clashes.Kurdish activists posted photos showing smoking rising from buildings and YPG fighters raising the Syrian Kurdistan flag in areas said to be taken from government forces.Syrian officials were not immediately available for comment and state media did not mention the clashes. A spokesman for the YPG was not available.Damascus has promoted its ties with the Kurds, saying that it provides military support to Kurdish forces to help them battle Islamic State, although the PYD denies that it cooperates with the central government.During the three-year war in Syria, Kurds have asserted control in parts of the northeast where their community predominates. Islamic State and other hardline groups consider Kurds heretics and have fought to take areas they control.There were smaller scale clashes in May between Assad loyalists and Kurds in Hassakeh that were contained.Around 200,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011, according to the United Nations.

He announced the initiative at the ribbon-cutting of SpaceX's new office in Seattle. The new venture will be a branch of the private space travel company. The company plans to put hundreds of satellites into orbit around the Earth -- circling the planet at about 750 miles above the surface, far closer than the typical communications satellites that soar at altitudes of 22,000 miles. The goal is to speed up data flows and deliver high-speed Internet to the more than 3 billion people who still have shoddy access to the Web, according to Bloomberg Businessweek’s Ashlee Vance, whose biography of Musk is due out in May. “Our focus is on creating a global communications system that would be larger than anything that has been talked about to date,” Musk told Vance. SpaceX did not respond to a request from The Huffington Post for comment on Saturday morning. Friday's event was closed to media, though attendees tweeted photos and excerpts of Musk's speech.It’s unclear when the initiative will be completed, though Musk said it will take at least five years to roll out the first generation of satellites. The project could take up to 15 years to reach full capacity. But as with most of Musk’s endeavors, the ultimate ambitions are far loftier. Musk is laying the groundwork for the first interplanetary Internet.Earlier this month, Musk said he aimed to unveil preliminary plans later this year for a colony on Mars. The network of satellites girdling Earth, providing high-speed Internet from Cleveland to Kampala, would eventually connect to the human outpost on the red planet, too.“It will be important for Mars to have a global communications network as well,” Musk said. “I think this needs to be done, and I don’t see anyone else doing it.”The project will cost between $10 billion and $15 billion, Musk said. But the revenues generated from the service will help fund the colonization of Mars.To be sure, these are longterm plans. The company must first perfect its rockets, which will enable cheaper travel to and from the planet’s surface. SpaceX launched a supply ship to the International Space Station last Saturday, but the rocket -- meant to be the world’s first reusable projectile -- crash-landed on a floating seaborne platform.A Vine video shows last week's sloppy landing.

Like many other Muslims who value free speech but are conscious of the distortions that some media propagate, I have felt a sense of isolation in recent weeks - a difficulty in finding a representative voice amid the clutter. And so I wanted to draw what I see from my own vantage point. What I see are people who commit atrocities in the name of my faith, either through complete ignorance of what Islam is about, or through the intentional twisting of its words and spirit for their own political gain. And I see media that is more than happy to accept this dramatic discourse and use it to misrepresent Islam on a wider scale, feeding into a dangerous Clash of Civilisations narrative. And I see both from the other side.Violent ignorance and misrepresentation rely on each other. They feed on one another and fuel one another, creating a cyclone that is threatening the middle ground on all sides and insulting our common humanity and intelligence.In Islam we are encouraged to do ""da'wah"" -- spreading and propagating the message of our faith, primarily through our own good deeds and actions.

Liu and partner Rafael Ramos were shot in the head on December 20, 2014, as they sat in their patrol car by suspected gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who police said had a clear anti-police bias and posted Instagram comments that were anti-government and referenced two unarmed black men killed recently by police. Brinsley fled to a subway station after the shootings and committed suicide.

A day after Target announced plans to close all 133 of its locations in Canada, Sears Canada offered discounts to its competitors’ employees and invited them to apply for jobs at its stores.“In recognition of the challenging retail landscape and yesterday’s announcement regarding the exit of Target from the Canadian market, Sears Canada wishes to do something meaningful to help employees affected by store closings and job losses and to do so in a respectful manner,” the company said in a statement on Friday.Beginning next Wednesday and for the next four months, Target employees in the country can purchase products at Sears at a discount of up to 25 percent. Sears will also host job fairs across Canada. The retailer invited executives from Target Canada to meet Sears executives at the company’s Toronto headquarters next Wednesday to discuss potential openings.Target did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday.It’s a bold move by a retailer struggling to maintain its own workforce in its home country. Last month, Sears Holdings announced plans to shutter hundreds of Sears and Kmart stores in the U.S. as sales plummet. The closures prompted more than 8,000 layoffs as of November, according to the financial site Seeking Alpha. “It’s a vulture move,” Brian Sozzi, a retail analyst and chief executive at Belus Capital Advisors, told The Huffington Post. “You have Sears trying to swoop in and prey on the emotions of people who just lost their jobs.” Sears Canada has been one of Sears Holdings’ most troubled units. In October, the parent company announced a rights offering -- a move that allows shareholders to buy more stock of the company -- in an effort to generate up to $380 million in cash and decrease its stake in the business. The company already reduced its stake to 51 percent from 95 percent in 2012 as sales began to fall.Sears’ business in Canada has fared slightly better than its fast-declining U.S. operation, but it isn’t far behind, Sozzi said. “Sears Canada is dreadful,” Sozzi said of the business. “It’s almost a direct reflection of what’s going on here.” Sears did not return a Saturday email requesting comment.
