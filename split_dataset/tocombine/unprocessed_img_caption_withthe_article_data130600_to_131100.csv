Glamour Magazine",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/youre-engaged-now-what-re_us_5b9dcdb4e4b03a1dcc8d183d,"There's so much to do! But don't jump into doing any of it just yet. You'll have plenty of time to write checklists and contact vendors -- but you can't get back the first few dreamy, floating-in-the-clouds days after you've just gotten engaged.",2014-01-26,2014-01-21-weddingplanningwhattodoafteryougetengaged.jpeg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-01-21-weddingplanningwhattodoafteryougetengaged-thumb.jpeg,"By Kim Fusaro, GlamourPhoto: Getty Images1. DO: Call your parents. You're probably tempted to post a harmless little ""I said YES!"" ring shot, but your families will be bummed if they hear about your engagement via Facebook -- or worse, from a neighbor who spotted the announcement first. Tell your family and close friends before you tell your Twitter and Instagram followers.2. DON'T: Ask everyone you know to be in your wedding party. ""Will you be a bridesmaid?"" will be on the tip of your tongue when you tell your besties, but hold off on asking till you've talked to your groom about your wedding party. Maybe he only wants his brother to stand beside him -- which is going to look awkward if your sister, three childhood BFFs, and all 12 girls from your sorority pledge class are on your side.3. DO: Insure your ring. I know, so unsexy. But imagine if your brand-new engagement ring got -- yikes! -- lost or stolen. Spendy pieces of jewelry generally aren't protected under your standard homeowner's or renter's* insurance, so either add a rider (extra insurance) or take out a ring-specific policy from a company like Perfect Circle, which specialize in jewelry insurance.* If you rent and don't have renter's insurance, get it TODAY. Trust me.More from Glamour: 11 Dating Don'ts You Should Stop Doing Now4. DON'T: Rush out and buy your wedding dress. You've had a dream dress on your secret Pinterest board for years, but don't rush out and buy it -- even if there's a sample sale. Shopping for wedding dresses is special, and you only get to do it once, so take your time and try on a bunch of dresses -- that dream gown isn't going anywhere. Plus, you want your dress to fit with the season, your wedding venue, and the overall vibe of your wedding. A floaty boho slip dress (perfect for a springtime garden wedding) will look out of place if you wind up having a black-tie wedding in a hotel ballroom in the dead of winter.5. DO: Get a manicure. It'll make the big engagement ring reveal a little less special if you have to say over and over again, ""But don't look at my cuticles! They're offensive!"" So treat yourself to a mani -- but leave your engagement ring at home if you haven't insured it!6. DON'T: Don't break out the wedding-planning binder right away. OMG! You're getting MARRIED! There's so much to DO! But don't jump into doing any of it just yet. You'll have plenty of time to write checklists and contact vendors -- but you can't get back the first few dreamy, floating-in-the-clouds days after you've just gotten engaged. Make a point to enjoy your newly engaged bliss. When people press you about wedding plans (which they will, the SECOND there's a ring on your finger), say, ""We're taking a few weeks to enjoy being engaged. We'll start wedding planning in the spring"" (or whatever the next season is).Are any of you newly engaged?

Tbilisi's ""Soviet Blocks?"" (Abu-Fadil) (Georgia was for decades under the Soviet umbrella and in a previous era Imperial Russia held sway over the country's affairs. It enjoyed a few years of independence in the early 20th Century, went through a brief civil war in 1991-92, and since 2003 has known relative stability).But it also features Caucasus-style architecture and modern creations in steel, glass and whatever struck designers' fancy, like the Tbilisi Concert Hall.  Tbilisi Concert Hall (Abu-Fadil)A bus ride from my hotel to the older part of town for a mere 28 U.S. Cents meant I could take in some major sites.Sadly, my brief stay prevented me from actually going inside the ones I really wanted to see, like the museums.But a walk down Rustaveli Avenue, so named after a 12th Century Georgian poet, on a cold January morning allowed me to appreciate some of the country's history, which my guide recounted with relish.The Moors, usually associated with Morocco and Andalusia in Spain, influenced Georgians whose capital city Opera House and Theater was built in their architectural tradition.I wish I could have attended a performance there or seen those acrobatic, toe-hopping Georgian dancers in their colorful traditional costumes. Moorish Opera House and Theater on Rustaveli Avenue (Abu-Fadil)An impressive gold statue of St. George slaying the dragon and perched atop a column in Freedom Square on the grand avenue caught my eye. The majority of Georgians, I was told, are Orthodox Christians.  St. George slays the dragon in Freedom Square (Abu-Fadil)Twice on my short promenade I came across signs for what seemed to be Iraqi businesses.One publicized ""halal"" Arabic and Iraqi food, in keeping with Islamic law, and the other held with wires onto a metal gate advertised services of a travel and tourist agency that also dabbled in hotel and apartment reservations, money transfers, translations, exports/imports, accounting and real estate. Iraqi jack-of-all-trades firm in Tbilisi (Abu-Fadil)Other vendors on that street offered local fast foods and snacks but what stood out the most were McDonald's golden arches.  Tbilisi vendors (Abu-Fadil)From a distance I could see a statue of Kartlis Deda (Mother Georgia) guarding over the city, a welcoming cup of wine for friends in one hand and a sword to ward off enemies in the other. Mother Georgia (Abu-Fadil)As we strolled down into the older part of the city with cobblestone streets and trendy watering holes, I was taken aback by a purple sign on the side of a building that read: ""Medusa Hookah Lounge and Club.""Mercifully there was a no smoking section at the hotel's dining room, but the lounge stunk of tobacco-related products, as did most of the places I visited. The hills above that gentrified neighborhood offer a panoramic view of expensive restaurants, houses and a cable car where visitors can ride up to the 4th Century Narikala (inaccessible) Fortress. Cable car ride to Narikala Fortress (Abu-Fadil)There was no shortage of Georgian Orthodox, Armenian Gregorian and Roman Catholic churches along the way. I tried entering two that shared a common courtyard but both were locked.I bought two cloisonné enamel crosses and a silver crucifix as gifts, along with a typical Georgian hat and other hand-made souvenirs. Requisite bottles of Georgian vodka called ""Cha Cha"" and cognac are warming reminders of the visit.The final attraction I caught before heading back to finish packing and going to the airport was the ultra-modern pedestrian bridge cutting across the Mtkvari River.

Photographer: Jason Alden/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3074a2100000001c7acca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Paul Carrel and Ben HirschlerDAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Just as they were getting their swagger back, the global elite stumbled last week on an emerging market sell-off that served as a reminder of the risks the global economy still faces.Veterans of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos seized on the wobble as a warning that expectations for a smooth upswing were misplaced, and that recovery would likely be volatile and uneven.The euro zone crisis is out of its acute phase and growth is returning across the developed world but a revival fuelled largely by vast amounts of new central bank money is a capricious one.The prospect of the U.S. Federal Reserve turning off its money taps this year, combined with political troubles in several emerging markets, drove last week's sell-off and exposed some of the unresolved problems in both developing and advanced economies.""I hear way too much optimism now,"" Larry Fink, CEO of investment group BlackRock, told the forum.""I think the experience of the marketplace this week is going to be indicative of this entire year. We are going to be in a world of much greater volatility.""The return of growth in the United States, Japan and Europe masks festering problems from chronic youth unemployment to skills shortages and rising inequality that dampened any hubris in Davos.Tech executives were exuberant about breakthroughs that are revolutionising production, healthcare and communication but others warned those advances may kill jobs.CEOs in Davos complained more vociferously than ever about a lack of talent for hire despite sky-high unemployment in rich and poor countries alike.In the West, too many young people are graduating from expensive colleges with high debts and the wrong skills, while in developing countries a big majority are not achieving their economic potential.Worldwide unemployment hit nearly 202 million in 2013, an increase of 5 million compared with a year earlier, the International Labour Organization reported last week.Joe Kaeser, chief executive of German engineering giant Siemens, questioned whether the world was really seeing an economic recovery at all.""Do we feel good because what we see is good?"" he asked. ""Or do we feel good because we just have eased the pain? How many jobs have we created? How many of those millions and millions of jobless people in Europe have we put into jobs?"" GLOBAL SHIFTThe year ahead will witness a marked shift in the balance among the world's main growth engines, with the United States and other developed economies contributing more and emerging markets somewhat less than before.Reduced Fed bond buying will reverse the liquidity that has flooded into higher-yielding emerging markets assets.""We expected this year to be a volatile year for EM as the Fed tapers,"" Mexican Finance Minister Luis Videgaray said, adding that volatility ""will happen throughout the year as tapering goes on"".Despite particular worries in countries like Argentina and Turkey, CEOs are still determined to tap into the growing middle classes of the new mega-cities of Asia, Latin America and Africa. But they are becoming more selective.The notion of lumping together diverse economies like Brazil, Russia, India and China has gone.BlackRock's Fink said the Fed's tapering was just an excuse for turmoil in some emerging markets. The real cause was ""bad policy"" in the countries affected.Renault-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn, whose company has car plants in many emerging markets, said: ""You have to be ready when you invest in emerging markets for ups and downs.""In the short term, investors are braced for more downs.""We are on the cusp of a slowdown in emerging markets,"" said Scott Gordon of Taconic Capital Advisors. ""There is a higher proportion of developed market growth that will drive the global economy."" COMPLACENCY RISKYet advanced economies also have work to do to put their houses in order.""Complacency is both the positive and the negative of Davos this year,"" said John Studzinski, global head of Blackstone Advisory Partners. ""On the one hand, we're not looking at the break-up of the euro zone anymore and people are more relaxed.""On the other hand, people are not paying attention to things they need to, like the education reform that is needed to resolve mismatches in the workforce, particularly in Europe and the United States.""Even as headline growth numbers improve, few citizens are feeling the recovery. A survey by consulting group Alix Partners of 6,000 adults in six European countries conducted in mid-January showed 71 percent of those questioned saw the economy staying the same or getting worse over the next year.Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned policymakers of ""some of the old risks that have not yet been completely fixed"", added to which is the threat of deflation in Europe.A case in point is a European Union plan to curb banks' ability to take market bets with their own money, which Germany and France have attacked, warning in a paper seen by Reuters that it could jeopardise a delicate revival.In some cases, European policymakers cannot even agree on the problems they should be tackling.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble publicly disagreed with EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn's view that prolonged low inflation in the euro zone would make necessary economic rebalancing harder.Schaeuble called that view ""nonsense"".Both Rehn and French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said the European Parliament could still ""improve"" a complex system for winding up failed banks agreed by the EU last month. Schaeuble said there was little scope for change without breaching EU treaties.Joe Jimenez, chief executive of Swiss drugmaker Novartis , said the conversation at Davos had shifted from five years of angst over financial crisis to talk of economic recovery, but companies were still hesitant about the levels of investment which could drive lasting growth.""If we had the certainty I think you would see more and more companies around the world leaning forward in terms of investment,"" he said.

5,BUSINESS,Yen Falls As U.S. Watches Closely,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yen-falls-us_us_5bb3074ce4b0480ca661d86a,"But it was possible some U.S. officials suspected that Japan was ""encouraging further depreciation of the yen by winking",2014-01-26,"Money traders work at computer terminals with screens indicating the U.S. dollar which is traded at 104.309 yen at a foreign exchange company in Tokyo, Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2014. The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.364 while the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 104.33 yen. (AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3074c260000e90082025d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By William MallardTOKYO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - After falling by almost a fifth since Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power just over a year ago, the yen is in a sweetspot for the economy.Companies have roared back with bumper profits as the currency's slide to five-year lows made exports more competitive and while import prices, notably for fuel, have climbed, importers are benefiting too.But should the yen keep falling, the drawbacks of higher import prices and possible anger from Washington and other trading powers could start to outweigh the benefits of a weaker currency. Those benefits start shifting to drawbacks if the yen slips to 120-130 per dollar from its current Goldilocks' range of 100-110.The yen may weaken further as the U.S. Federal Reserve slowly tightens its dollar-liquidity spigot while expectations grow that the Bank of Japan will increase its own flood of money into the economy to offset a sales-tax increase in just over two months, say Japanese executives, policymakers and investors.""I don't think many people in Japan want a yen decline to around 120 or 130 to the dollar,"" said BOJ economist Nobuyasu Atago, who is now on a stint at the Japan Center for Economic Research. ""Many companies have already moved production overseas and may also become hesitant to boost exports for political considerations.""Indeed, Japanese firms are not clamouring for a further drop and they believe the yen's fall has largely run its course, a new Reuters poll shows. For years, a strong yen had sapped Japan's export competitiveness and worsened its deflation. For the past two months, the dollar has traded between 100 yen and its high at the start of the year of 105.44. That is the peak for the U.S. currency since October 2008 - the early days of the global financial crisis, when investors began fleeing risk for the perceived safe haven of the yen.It ended Friday trading at 102.28, having slipped in recent days as stock markets fell. HITTING THE SPOTExecutives at about half the 400 companies in the Reuters Corporate Survey said they both expect and hope the yen will be in its current narrow range of 100-105 to the dollar six months from now, while more than 90 percent predict and want to see the Japanese currency in a broader 90-110 range. Only 5 percent wanted the yen to weaken beyond 110 to the dollar.Even the losers from the weak yen see its broader benefits for Japan.""For us the weaker the yen gets, the tougher it gets,"" said Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines Co, which pays for its aircraft and fuel in dollars.""But it is important for Japan's economy to rebound, so a level of around 100 yen is necessary"" and weakening a bit beyond 105 yen would be better, Ueki told reporters at a new year's gathering of business leaders. ""We can adjust to it as long as there is stability.""Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Japan's leading heavy-machinery maker and aerospace company, would be ""grateful"" for a yen slide to 115-120 to the dollar, said chairman Hideaki Omiya.And yet, he said, ""I think the yen is balanced at the moment around the 100-105 yen level. From the viewpoint of both importers and exporters, a skewed rate is not good. And with the strong yen reversed, what we need now is stability."" WARY WASHINGTONBoth China and South Korea - major trading rivals to Japan which compete in a number of markets such as auto and electronics - have raised concerns about the slide in the yen in recent weeks.The United States has welcomed Japan's economic rebound after Abe came to power 13 months ago promoting a policy mix of massive BOJ easing and government spending - dubbed Abenomics by the media.If the yen's fall is the result, rather than the aim, of these growth policies, Washington seems willing to tolerate a gentle yen decline - to a point.""They need to get their domestic economy growing,"" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said this month. But he said, taking questions at a forum, ""their long-term growth can't be rooted in a strategy that ultimately turns in any way towards reliance on an unfair advantage because of the exchange rate.""He added, ""We continue to analyse it very closely.""Ted Truman, a former senior official at the Treasury Department and the Fed, said that as long as the Japanese ""are not deliberately acting to push down the yen, I don't think, as a matter of economics, the United States government would be particularly unhappy.""But it was possible some U.S. officials suspected that Japan was ""encouraging further depreciation of the yen by winking and nodding, if not overt actions,"" said Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.If that is the case, ""I'm sure the Treasury is making clear to the Japanese that if there is any hint of that going on, it will be a big problem,"" Truman said. ""And we have enough problems with Japan as it is.""Still, current and former Japanese officials knowledgeable about currency diplomacy say a yen fall to 110 to the dollar might not raise the heat on Tokyo - that the threshold might be more like 120-130 yen.Treasury and Japanese Finance Ministry officials declined to comment on their currency conversations.IMF Deputy Managing Director Naoyuki Shinohara, who was Japan's top currency official from 2007-09, shrugged off concerns that the yen's weakness could lead to tensions between Tokyo and Washington.""It is clear that what Japan is trying to do now is beat deflation,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""There may be some changes in the way (the U.S. government) communicates due to its relations with Congress. But I don't feel Japan's weak yen is seen as a big problem."" FEAR TRAIN?Of course, no one can rule out a yen decline that turns into a plunge. One trigger could be if the markets lose confidence in Japan's ability to control its debt, especially if the Abe recovery should derail.So far, despite having public debt far above 200 percent of GDP - the heaviest burden in the industrial world - Japan can still borrow 10-year money at less than 0.7 percent. But Abe has ramped up government spending to spur recovery, and the BOJ is gobbling up most of the government's bond sales - practices that cannot continue forever and could someday unnerve investors.Japanese government figures show Abe cannot meet a promise to balance the budget in coming years on the current course, the first time official figures have confirmed a view already held by many economists, Reuters reported on Friday.In the Reuters corporate survey, four out of five companies expected a euro-style debt crisis in Japan within a decade, although few fear it is imminent.""All it might take is a small event to trigger a catastrophic shift in the perception of Japan,"" said Neal Gilbert, market strategist at Gain Capital in Grand Rapids, Michigan.""If one of the major rating agencies suddenly downgrades Japan, citing the potential ineffectiveness of Abenomics, confidence in the programme could change overnight, and the yen could bear the brunt of that sea change,"" he said. ""As we've seen recently in Europe, once the fear train gets rolling, it takes an incredible amount of effort to bring it to a stop."""
