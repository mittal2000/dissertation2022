The Italian couple may have looked like typical tourists, visiting the sites and shooting photos, but it was the objects in their photos that attracted the curious stares. Accompanying the couple during their travels, were Barbie and Ken, the iconic plastic dolls.  During their visits to Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, Tel Aviv, Nazareth and the Dead Sea, Pescantini and Callea shot photos of the sites with Ken and Barbie 'posing' in the background.  The photo project, entitled ""Barbie Loves Israel,"" is now on display at a popular bar in a Milan, the couple's hometown in Italy. Italian fashion magazines such as Italian Vanity Fair and Vogue have also featured the couple's photo exhibition, which include shots of Barbie and Ken floating in the Dea Sea, riding on a jeep ride in Ein Gedi, catching the waves in Tel Aviv, and posing in Jerusalem with the Dome of the Rock in the background.Photo Credit: Enrico Pescantini and Maria Giovanna Callea / Description: In Tel Aviv Life is a Beach The unique idea for the pop-art photography was born as Pescantini and Callea were planning their trip to Israel last year. At the time, the two were living miles apart, with Enrico in Mumbai working for a telecommunications company and Maria in Milan working in advertising. Pescantini, whose passion is photography, began to consider what kind of photo shoot the couple could stage during their vacation in the Holy Land.  ""The idea was to use Barbie and Ken as our alter-egos"" wrote Callea to Tazpit News Agency. ""Ken would come from Mumbai and Barbie from Milan and they would begin their trip together in Tel Aviv, just as we did. For the rest of the trip, we documented our Israel experience through Barbie and Ken.""   The August trip was the Italian couple's first visit to Israel. ""We were fascinated and attracted by the idea of discovering a mix of different cultures, landscapes, religions, and people,"" Callea told Tazpt News Agency.  ""Barbie and Ken always aroused curiosity in people - we always had eyes on us during our photo shoots,"" recalled Callea. ""But people were always smiling.""  Callea and Pescantini thoroughly enjoyed their vacation to the country. ""Israel was one of best trips of the year, with amazing cities full of nice people, each with a unique atmosphere. Israel surpassed our expectations!"" exclaimed the couple.Photo Credit: Enrico Pescantini and Maria Giovanna Callea / Description: Barbie Loves Israel Manifesto  Pescantini, 28, and Callea, 30, also noted that the photos were ""just pictures of their holidays, without any commercial or political purpose.""  The couple are planning to bring Ken and Barbie on their next holiday abroad, following their first successful trip with their 'plastic friends' in Israel.  The Barbie doll was created in 1959 by a Jewish businesswoman Ruth Handler, the co-founder of Mattel. Handler named the doll after her daughter Barbara, and later added another plastic counterpart to Barbie's world - Ken, Barbie's boyfriend, named after Handler's younger son.  The ""Barbie Loves Israel"" exhibition by Enrico Pescantini and Maria Giovanna Callea will be on display at Milan's Kitsch Bar, Corso Sempione 5, from January 30 -- February 20."

According to the calendar and the train schedule, February 10th is a Sunday. But something feels different.There is no football. February 10th is the first of 30 Sundays until the 2013 NFL season kicks off in Baltimore on September 5. To ease you off your pigskin habit, here are some of the most memorable highlights from the season that concluded last week in New Orleans. Need more football? Here's a longer look back at the 2012 season:Although Joe Flacco and the Baltimore Ravens lifted the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning the HarBowl, Minnesota running back Adrian Peterson may have delivered the most impressive performance of the 2012 season. Defying science and would-be tacklers, the freak (mutant, alien or what ever you want to call him) came up just nine yards shy of breaking Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record en route to being named 2012 MVP and Offensive Player of the Year. He did all of that -- started in all 16 games and rushed for 2,097 yards and 12 touchdowns -- after having reconstructive knee surgery at the very end of 2011. Peterson's comeback from torn anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments didn't earn him the Comeback Player of the Year award though. That went to Peyton Manning, who missed an entire season after having four neck surgeries. Manning never missed a start, leading the Denver Broncos to a 13-3 record and the AFC West title. These regular-season success stories would both come to unhappy endings in the playoffs as Flacco and Colin Kaepernick took center stage. En route to Super Bowl XLVII, Flacco bested Tom Brady up in New England while Kaepernick bested the single-game rushing total of every quarterback ever in any game. The Ravens' rise and Kaepernick's rise stole the spotlight from Peterson and Manning as well as the trio of rookie quarterbacks to start in the playoffs who made history of their own. From Manning's 400th career touchdown pass (Week 1) to Jacoby Jones' 108-yard kickoff return in the Super Bowl, some of the most memorable plays from the season can be found above. Hopefully this will hold you over for the next 30 weekends. "

(Photo by Joseph Johnson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6cfca2600002d018326eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Beth Ann Baldry, GolfweekCHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand – It was a remarkable display of poise and precision. Lydia Ko, the 15-year-old Kiwi who isn’t old enough to know what failure feels like and wins national opens the way most girls her age win club championships, made the locals proud on Sunday at Clearwater Golf Club. Ko won the ISPS Handa New Zealand Women’s Open by one stroke over American Amelia Lewis, who three-putted the 54th hole. Lewis took home the winner’s paycheck, but not the trophy.“I didn’t cry at the Canadian Open,” said Ko when asked about her teary walk off the 18th. “I guess (this tournament) meant more.”Ko missed only one green on Sunday, hitting it long on the third hole out of the rough. That, incidentally, was her only bogey of the day. Ko closed with a 4-under 68 for a 10-under 206 total. This marks her third professional victory, including the 2012 CN Canadian Women’s Open (youngest in LPGA history) and the NSW Open, which she won at age 14.Ko, the first Kiwi to win the NZ Women’s Open, said she doesn’t have a “trophy holder place.” Judging by the way she handles herself down the stretch at big events, she might want to invest in a trophy case.It wasn’t the smoothest start for Ko this morning, who left her yardage book back at the house where she was staying. Her mom delivered the book 10 minutes before she arrived at the first tee, where she shared the lead with another young Korean, Seon Woo Bae, heading into the final round.A birdie for Ko on the first set the tone for the day. Bae held steady with Ko throughout the front nine, while Aussie Stacey Keating and Lewis charged hard on the back. Lewis took a one-shot lead with an eagle on the par-5 10th hole followed by birdies on Nos. 12 and 13. A birdie from Ko on the 15th brought her level with Lewis, who was playing in the group ahead.On the 18th, Lewis hit the green short left of the flag and ran her birdie putt 5 feet past the hole. A miss there gave Ko a one-shot lead while standing just off the 18th fairway. She hit her approach to 30 feet and two-putted for the home victory.“I don’t play for the money,” said Lewis, who took home Ko’s winner’s check of $30,000. “But I guess it does soften the blow.”Ko went to celebrate at the Japanese restaurant where she started the week. It won’t be a long night out as she must leave for the airport at 4 a.m. to catch her Monday morning flight to the ISPS Handa Australian Women’s Open.Several LET players were on hand to watch Ko finish on the 18th, including last year’s Order of Merit winner Carlota Ciganda. The Spanish star played alongside Ko the first two rounds and was impressed with every aspect of her game.“I think because she’s 15 she doesn’t realize what she’s doing,” Ciganda said.To be sure, there are certain benefits that only youth can provide. But that shouldn’t take away from what the young player has accomplished. She might not realize now the significance of her achievements, nor how difficult this game can be at times. That doesn’t change the fact that she’s making history.And her year is just getting started."

Scouts and their families have delivered a petition to the Boy Scouts of America headquarters urging an end to a policy banning gay scouts and leaders from the organization. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ccc8c26000036007f9fc9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I grew up in boy scouts from the age of 12-18. I absolutely loved it. I hope that some day it is an experience my son and I can share together. This week, the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America delayed a decision on whether or not to allow the LGBT community to be open members of their organization. I'll be dropping this letter in the mail today. I thought I'd share it here too. Dear Boy Scouts of America,I need to tell you something that I suspect you already know. There are already plenty of LGBT people in your organization. In my troop alone there were three gay men that I know of. Two remained closeted until later in life and are still my friends. One came out while still in the troop. We ridiculed him, teased him and bullied him. He was eventually asked to leave the troop by our leadership. He left, broken-hearted. His mom, Barbara, was a kind and quiet woman. Before her son left the troop, she had already volunteered to be one of the adults who would attend a once-in-a-lifetime Boy Scout trip to the Philmont Scout Ranch. Knowing that if she didn't attend we wouldn't be able to go, she still went with us -- even though her son wasn't allowed.For two weeks we would get to backpack through the wilderness in New Mexico learning outdoor, teambuilding and leadership skills. And for two weeks she would hike silently among us while we used words like gay, queer and faggot.About halfway through our second week we were all sitting around the camp fire joking and Barbara hit her breaking point. I don't recall what was said that made her tip, but it was probably something insensitive and hateful. She lashed out sobbing and yelling as she pointed at each one of us accusingly.""It is your fault that my son isn't here! It is your fault he is at home crying! It is your fault he lost all of his friends! It is your fault I worry about him every day! You are all so mean!""""No,"" said one of the boys. ""It's his fault.""And then she broke down into sobs, stood up and walked away into the darkness to find her tent. She didn't bring it up again. We spent the rest of the week joking and hiking and singing songs on the trail. And while we went home having learned how to tie knots and build a fire without matches, not a single one of us had learned anything that night at the fire.A Boy Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean and Reverent. We were none of these things. And while our cruel behavior was not endorsed by the BSA, the seed of it, an institutional policy of discrimination was. It took me a lot of years, and a lot of life experience to realize how wrong we all were sitting around the campfire that night, and how right Barbara was to point her finger at us. So now I'm going to do the same thing to you. It is your fault that these kids have to live in fear. It is your fault that they feel isolated and different. It is your fault that LGBT parents of Boy Scouts have to sit down with their kids and explain why they can't be a leader in their troop. It is your fault, Boy Scouts of America.It is time to change. I believe you can change -- and as scary as it is, I believe you can survive that change. There is so much right about the Boy Scouts. It makes me sad that all that is talked about these days is your policy on homosexuality in your membership. I learned a myriad of different practical, social and leadership skills in the Boy Scouts that have directly contributed to my success today. Not only that, I made some of the greatest friends of my life -- almost all of which I still keep in contact with. Three were groomsman at my wedding. Being a scout was an incredible force for good in my life... but I also sat around a campfire one night and looked into a crying mother's eyes and told her that her son was not good enough to be a Boy Scout, or my friend. And I just can't risk my son ever learning that that is OK. Most of the mistakes we make in life, we are not conscious of until after they are made. I made mistakes when I was 13 that you are still making today. But it isn't too late. Please make the right decision in May. Please amend your policy of exclusion. I really want my son to be a Boy Scout, but regardless of how he turns out, if the BSA doesn't change, he won't be wearing the uniform. And that makes me incredibly sad.John KinnearLife Scout and father of twoAn earlier version of this piece appeared on John Kinnear's personal blog, Ask Your Dad."

Something fishy there.So, playing on the fact that the only other thing in nature with the same color hair as Trump's is the orange haired orangutan, I joked that Donald Trump needed to show me his papers to prove he wasn't hiding a bad secret about his birth -- this is known as ""parody,"" and it's a form of something we in the comedy business call a ""joke."" Naturally, I also aped, if you will, Trump's offer of money to a charity of his choosing, which I identified as the Hair Club for Men. This upset the Donald so much they could barely get him to stop flinging his feces.Now, public figures of course don't always like everything that's said about them, but that's how we roll here in America -- just like we're the gun country, we're the joke country; we love our free speech, and we love celebrities getting taken down a peg, so Don should just suck it up like everyone else does.But not Trump -- his lawyer Scott Balber sent me a letter -- I shit you not this is real -- that says:""Attached hereto is a copy of Mr. Trump's birth certificate, demonstrating that he is the son of Fred Trump, and not an orangutan.""Do these morons even know it's impossible for people and apes to produce offspring? So, I ignored the letter like I ignore all letters I get from crazy people, and I forgot about the whole thing until this week, when Trump and his lawyer actually sued me for the five million -- and don't forget, this is not a libel case. They seem to be trying to set a bold new precedent that jokes on late night talk shows are now legally binding agreements between the comedian and the person they're making fun of. Yeah, I'm sure this'll go all the way to the Supreme Court.The legal system in this country is not a joke -- it's not a toy for rich idiots to play with. And frankly, what they released raises more questions than it answers -- at least it does to a growing chorus of patriotic Americans who call ourselves ""Apers"" and we're just asking questions!Questions like -- well, what they put out: It's the short form ""Certification of Live Birth,"" not a birth certificate. It was clearly made on a dot-matrix computer printer and includes a scannable bar code, two technologies that were hardly around in 1946. Where's the original, long-form certificate? Because a short-form copy of a birth certificate unsigned by an attending physician isn't proof of anything. You know who I learned that from? I learned that from Donald ""But I'm White"" Trump, who wouldn't accept the exact same document from the president.But remember who we're dealing with here: a man who, for a little extra publicity, will happily keep alive a debate over whether his family reunions are held at the zoo."

But upon learning on Monday that Trump had sued Maher for $5 million dollars in the wake of the remark, Koko the Gorilla has gone apeshit. ""I have dedicated my life to speaking up for apes,"" a despondent Koko said in American Sign Language, a talent that has earned her worldwide fame. ""And if Donald Trump thinks it was insulting to be compared to gorillas, imagine how we feel being compared to him. I mean, apes are at least somewhat evolved. If anything, we should be his descendants.""Trump's lawsuit is based on Maher's failure to deliver the $5 million he promised to pony up if Trump could offer proof that his parentage was not simian. While legal experts do not predict a likelihood of success, such details do not matter to Koko, who now worries that her efforts to save her species from extinction have been threatened by association to the hair-challenged billionaire.  ""If the public believes that ape reproduction leads to people like, like, like this..."" Koko wept at a hastily convened press conference, her fingers frantically forming the word ""clownfish"" (her customary sign for Donald Trump), ""our cause is hopeless."" Koko has filed a defamation lawsuit, charging Maher with ""reckless disregard for an entire species."" Surprisingly, she has retained prominent First Amendment advocate Lloyd Abramson to represent her. ""Even free speech has its limitations,"" Abramson explained, shaking his head. ""You can't yell fire in a crowded theater, and you can't compare an ape to a jackass.""  Koko's supporters were likewise shaken by the news of the Trump-ape association. Ape activist Janice Goodwin referred to Maher's comparison as a ""backslide"" from which the ape community is unlikely to recover. ""We've worked so hard to show that apes are better creatures than people like The Donald,"" she said defeatedly, ""that they don't simply spend their days masturbating, throwing feces at whoever walks by, and beating their alpha-male chests. Now all of that hard work is undone.""During an exclusive interview with Koko at her secret sanctuary in the Santa Cruz mountains, the nimble-fingered gorilla did little more than sit in a corner of her cage, repeatedly signing the word ""Seriously?"" Consequently, her caretaker, Dian Folsom, often spoke for her.""She feels singled out by what she perceives to be a vicious attack on all apes,"" Folsom said. ""What's interesting is that she used to use the sign for 'angel' when referring to Mr. Maher in conversation because of his outspoken support for PETA. But after this verbal assault, she now uses the word 'poacher,"" and sometimes 'douchebag.' It's all so very sad."" Toward the end of the interview, Koko roused herself from her corner, maniacally waving a copy of Koko's Kitten, the popular children's book that tells the story of her real-life friendship with her adopted pet cat. ""I've tried everything I could think of to show our humanity, that apes feel, that apes understand, that apes are just like you!"" Koko feverishly signed. ""I mean, my best friend is a kitten -- a fucking kitten! How much more human do I have to be?"" When a reporter tried to comfort Koko by remarking that her fans would not discount the 1,000 signs she has learned, simply because of a single comparison to Donald Trump, she pointed to a picture of Trump, signed the word ""useless"" and concluded the interview. ""This has all been so frustrating to us,"" lamented Folsom. ""Although Koko's vocabulary includes the words for 'happy,' 'funny' and 'laugh,' the more nuanced concept of comedic sarcasm has proven difficult to teach."" Folsom went on to say that, despite the efforts of highly trained sign-language specialists to teach her the word for ""joke,"" Koko -- like Mr. Trump -- remains unable to grasp the concept."

If it's been a while since you've received a credit limit increase, you can try requesting one.First of all, know that this tactic will likely only work if you've had an excellent record with your credit card company. Find your creditor's phone number on your latest statement or by searching online. Call them up and get an agent on the phone. Once you're talking to someone, tell them how good of a customer you've been, how you've always made your payments on time, and how you've enjoyed using the card. After this initial framework, tell them that you'd like to request a credit limit increase.Watch out for: Sometimes, credit limit increase requests can come with a new hard inquiry to your credit. Make sure to ask first if this will happen so that you know what to expect and if you'd still like to go through with your request.Task: Write a ""Goodwill adjustment letter"" for a past late payment. Benefit: Removes a late payment from an otherwise good-looking credit report. Time: 15 minutes Tactic: If you've recently made a late bill payment when you're ordinarily on top of things, asking to have that one, small black mark removed could work for you. In your letter, you'll make a case for why the delinquency should be removed. Show what a loyal customer you've been and how much you've improved your financial situation since this one mistake. Model your letter after this example and wait about 30 days before following up, if you haven't heard anything.Watch out for: Remember that your credit card company doesn't have to remove the delinquency, so be prepared for that instance.Task: Make a plan to pay down your credit card debt at a faster rate. Benefit: Lowers your credit card utilization. Time: 30 minutes to an hour Tactic: If you tend to carry balances on your credit cards from month to month, work out a plan to pay down your debts faster so you can get your credit card utilization rate to lower than 30 percent -- that's the rate that credit experts recommend.First, see where you stand by calculating your current credit utilization rate. You can do this by taking your total credit card balances and dividing that number by your total credit card limits. Then, use the same strategy to find out your utilization rate on individual credit cards. For the cards reporting more than 30 percent, work on those first. If you've only been making the minimum payments on those cards, increase that repayment rate so you can steadily decrease your utilization rate.Watch out for: While you're working on lowering your balances, avoid using your credit cards with high utilization rates by leaving them behind when you leave the house. Otherwise, you'll just reverse all of your hard repayment work.Task: Transfer your credit card balances. Benefit: Lowers your credit card utilization and increases your total number of accounts. Time: 15 minutes (then 7-10 days, typically) Tactic: When you have lots of different credit cards with varying balances to repay, making multiple payments each month can seem tricky. There are several cards that offer introductory balance transfer rates, meaning if you transfer all or some of your other cards' balances, you won't pay any interest on those balances for a year or two (depending on the card). For instance, with the Discover It card, you'll have 14 months to pay down your transferred balances interest-free. You'll also decrease your credit card utilization in the process.Watch out for: In most cases, if you don't pay off your balance transfer completely during the introductory period, you'll have to pay interest on the entire transferred amount when that period is up. So this tactic is good for you if you're really ready to tackle your credit card debt.Task: Get rid of credit report errors. Benefit: Gives you a more accurate credit score. Time: 1 hour (then up to 30 days) Tactic: While some credit report errors don't affect your credit score at all (like inaccuracies in your personal information), others can severely impact your ability to get approved for credit (like inaccurate derogatory marks). Bottom line: Cleaning up your credit report should be a top priority. Use the step-by-step guide in How to Dispute an Error on Your Credit Report to help you through the process of cleaning up your reports.Watch out for: While some credit repair companies will tell you they can remove all negative information from your credit report through this process, that's simply not true. Accurate negative items on your report cannot be removed. Before you hire a company to help you dispute your credit report errors, read through our blog post on How to Spot a Credit Repair Scam.Bethy Hardeman writes on credit, personal finance and the economy for CreditKarma.com, a free credit management website that helps more than 10 million people access their credit score for free.

Clinton, at the House Democrats' annual retreat in Virginia, likened his opinion on the debt problem to that of Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman and advocated against ""conventional austerity measures.""Clinton said: The debt problem can’t be solved right now by conventional austerity measures, and that’s why Paul Krugman is right when he keeps talking about all these -- everybody that’s tried austerity in a time of no growth has wound up cutting revenues even more than they cut spending because you just get into the downward spiral and drag the country back into recession.SEE VIDEO BELOW Although Krugman has frequently advocated against austerity, today on HuffPost Live, Krugman voiced his opinion even more strongly, calling it ""an unethical experimentation on human beings."" ""All these countries are pursuing austerity policies, and in doing so, they are giving us evidence on what actually happens when you do those policies,"" Krugman said. Clinton also has been a longtime vocal opponent of austerity measures. In May, Clinton said at a financial conference that ""the prescription of austerity continues to be pushed in the face of evidence that it won't work."" In June, Clinton stood alongside President Barack Obama and said ""no amount of austerity will balance the budget,"" ABC News reported. On Tuesday, Obama asked Congress to seek a short-term deficit reduction package hoping to delay the current March 1 start date of automatic spending cuts. The White House and Congress have been unable to reach an agreement on how to reduce the deficit by around $4 trillion over 10 years. Obama, like Clinton, has said that the economic damage of the looming austerity measures must be avoided.(h/t ThinkProgress) WATCH:"

The mortgage was serviced by Bank of America.Pino asked the court to dismiss the case, arguing that the documents filed by the bank and its attorneys had been fraudulently backdated. The case stems from the robo-signing scandal, in which banks and law firms allegedly signed off on foreclosure documents without verifying their accuracy.The documents in Pino's case had been signed by an employee of the now-defunct David Stern law firm, one of the biggest foreclosure law firms in the country.Before the court could rule, BNY Mellon voluntarily dismissed the case. The foreclosure was later re-filed, using different documents. Pino's lawyer asked the court to re-open the first case, saying the bank should not have been allowed to bring the same case when it committed fraud the first time around.Before the case reached the Florida Supreme Court, Pino and BNY Mellon reached a confidential settlement. The high court decided to hear the case anyway to address what it said was a key policy question that has vexed courts across the state - whether or not voluntary dismissals can be reversed when there is an allegation of fraud.On Thursday, the Florida Supreme Court decided that it could not, unless the plaintiff - in this case, the bank - had obtained some kind of affirmative relief, and the dismissal had kept the fraud from being remedied by the court.However, the court acknowledged the ""multiple abuses that can occur from fraudulent pleadings,"" and asked Florida's bar association to review civil litigation rules to determine if changes should be made to address the issue.A lawyer for Pino, Amanda Lundergan of the Ice Firm, said she believed the ruling ""will have the unintended effect of encouraging underhanded tactics"" by plaintiffs in foreclosure and other cases.A spokesman for BNY Mellon, Kevin Heine, declined to comment. Bank of America did not immediately return a request for comment Friday evening.The case has been closely watched by banks and homeowners. An unfavorable ruling for the banks could have exposed them to severe financial liability in the state."

Mr. President -- our nation already has the technologies to protect the climate while advancing prosperity. Here's how.Your National Renewable Energy Laboratory showed just last June how to produce 80 to 90 percent of America's electricity from proven, reliable and increasingly competitive renewable sources like the sun and wind.That confirmed the findings of Rocky Mountain Institute's peer-reviewed study Reinventing Fire, introduced by the heads of Shell Oil and Exelon and endorsed by President Clinton. RMI showed how to run a 2.6-fold-bigger U.S. economy by 2050 with no oil, coal, or nuclear energy, one-third less natural gas, a $5 trillion dollar net savings, 82-86 percent lower carbon emissions, and no new inventions, with the transition led by business for growth and profit. The U.S. is already started towards a clean energy system based on technologies cost-competitive today in many markets and, unlike traditional generation, with steadily declining costs. These new winners include energy efficiency, solar, wind, and flexible demand through a smart grid, integrated with geothermal, biomass, hydro, and others. Soon most renewables will compete almost anywhere without subsidies -- especially if fossil-fuel subsidies are phased out too, as the G8 nations have agreed to do.Let's examine the biggest three -- efficiency, solar and wind.Energy efficiency can save 44 percent of projected 2050 electricity needs through proven building and industrial technologies that pay back far faster than any new source of supply. Wasting far less energy and getting the rest at lower and stable prices would powerfully boost jobs and growth.In many states today, homeowners and businesses get immediate savings by letting entrepreneurs finance solar power on their roof, with no money down. Falling costs reminiscent of cellphones and DVD players have roughly doubled U.S. solar deployment every year for the past five years. While overall capacity is presently low, 100 percent of our nation's annual electricity needs (after efficiency improvements) could be served with just seven more doublings of solar, readily achieved in the next few decades. Such is the power of exponential growth.Windpower's growth has been equally explosive. Iowa alone is now 20 percent wind-powered, and with only three more doublings, will receive all its electricity from wind while exporting the excess -- its current goal for 2030. That's putting millions in the pockets of Iowa farmers and county treasuries.Conventional wisdom is wrong that solar and wind aren't viable without a breakthrough in electricity storage. Analysis and experience prove that 60-80 percent solar and windpower -- sited across a region, forecasted, and balanced by flexible supply and demand -- can keep the lights on with often less storage or backup than traditional giant power stations need now. That's how Germany, without adding storage, is already one-fourth renewable-powered, and at times last spring met over half its electric load just with solar power. A smart grid will make this even more successful and resilient.Freeing American mobility from oil is another key to a richer, cooler, safer world. Deploying new DOE, DOD, and industry technologies could do this at an average cost of $25 per saved barrel. Ultralight, supersafe structures can make electric autos affordable by needing two-thirds fewer batteries. Over 25 varieties of electric and plug-in hybrid autos are on the market today, twice as many as two years ago. Smart charging and discharging of electric autos can even stabilize the grid and store renewable power.These technologies scale faster than any other. No form of traditional generation -- coal, gas, or nuclear -- scales nearly as fast as efficiency, solar, and wind. Gigawatts of solar and wind can be added in months -- not the years to decades required for traditional power plants. Cloudy Germany installed three gigawatts of solar in the month of December 2011 alone. That is 1.6 times more than was installed in the entire U.S. Germany's scale-up has cut its solar-system costs to half of ours.While we have these technologies, of course vibrant R & D investments are vital to keep America competitive and make clean energy even cheaper. Your Administration is wise to keep these strong.  Many climate scientists are calling for an end to fossil fuels in the next several decades to avoid severe climate change. This goal is aggressive but achievable, with competitive advantage, lower energy bills, and a stronger economy. Other countries are not waiting. China, Japan and India are tipping toward renewables; much of Europe already has. If we wait, they will own the future, our costs will rise, and so will risks to climate and global stability.Mr. President, we have the technologies. Please lead us in removing the barriers to scaling them quickly to save our climate, protect our economy, and restore our energy security.Amory Lovins is Chairman and Chief Scientist at Rocky Mountain Institute where Thomas Dinwoodie, former CEO of SunPower Corporation, Systems, is Lead Trustee."

President Bill Clinton, Inventor Dean Kamen, White House Chief Technology officer Todd Park and Astronaut Leland Melvin were among the big name speakers at this year's by-invitation-only TRANS4M conference, held at the California Science Center in Los Angeles this past Thursday February 7th. The conference and benefit concert last night at Avalon Hollywood (featuring Alicia Keys), raised an impressive $3.3. million for the i.am.angel foundation. ""Trans4m Boyle Heights, Trans4m America"" was the theme of this year's conference, curated by will.i.am and Intel Futurist Brian David Johnson. President Clinton commended will.i.am on focusing on Boyle Heights, the East LA community wiil.i.am grew up in, saying that change in that one community ""could serve as a blueprint for others all over the country, and all over the world."" The conference consisted of a series of speakers and panels organized around the themes of Community, Wellness, and S.T.E.A.M (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math) Education, Trans4m began the morning with breakfast under the newly installed Space Shuttle Endeavor - which was mind boggling in of itself. Astronaut Leland Melvin told the crowd that the space program had been an example of what humans can achieve, and continued to be an inspiration for all -- and here he quoted the title of a will.i.am song that was beamed from the Mars Rover Curiosity -- to ""reach for the stars."" What this conference had, that distinguishes it from other events such as TED or even the Clinton Global initiative was that each panel included the participation of students from Roosevelt High School in East LA, giving specific context to the hopes and dreams of these young students. Jeffrey Marenco, a student at Roosevelt, said that just seeing all the homeless on skid row, affected him. ""If I had a factory,"" he said, ""I'd give them all jobs."" Rosa Vasquez, a freshman at Roosevelt told her panel that wellness to her means ""feeling good inside and out."" To which Beatriz Perez, who heads Coca-Cola's global sustainability initiatives, spoke of her company's efforts to empower women in Africa, through clean water programs as well as through career opportunities with local Coca-Cola distributors and a recently launched Coca-Cola water purification and distribution centers. Many of the speakers shared their work and visions for the future. Margie Morris, a senior researcher at Intel, spoke of her work developing devices and software with emotional intelligence. Bill Goodwyn, CEO of Discover Education, discussed of the coming revolution in science education with digital textbooks and project-based learning. Morad Fareed, of Delos Living, discussed creating wellness standards for architecture. Jack Dangermond, of ESRI, spoke of his mapping technology that allows one to organize available data about a community's health, wellness, crime, voting patterns, and develop information-based solutions. This information, Dangermond said, provides project-based learning for students, and allows them to create bottom-up solutions. Comedian and panel host Baratunde Thurston quickly dubbed this ""Maptivism."" Dr. Bob Ross, president of the California Endowment, spoke of his own journey from being a pediatrician in crack-ravaged Camden, New Jersey to being a healer in the community by working for the endowment on programs to combat poverty and hopelessness. Dean Kamen, popularly known as the inventor of the Segway, talked about the importance of Arts education, even as regards science. A beautiful equation, or an elegant solution are, Kamen said, works of art. Kamen also spoke about the impact of will.i.am's involvement in Kamen's high school robotics competition that included attending the launch as well as the finals of the yearly competition, performing for the students, and producing a TV special on the competition that aired on ABC. Will.i.am, for his part, credited Kamen for ""changing his life"" and inspiring him to further his own science education (Apparently will.i.am has signed up to take a computer science course).  ""I really enjoy going to conferences and learning and observing people's passion points,"" will.i.am said, explaining that one of the conferences he most enjoys is the Clinton Global Initiative. President Clinton repaid the compliment, praising will.i.am for the Trans4m conference, and for calling upon each of us, as individuals, to take action for the greater good. ""Human potential, and intelligence is pretty much evenly distributed across the world,"" President Clinton said. ""Opportunity is not."" Clinton outlined three big challenges to economic growth: too much inequality, too much instability and too little sustainability. However, Clinton said, ""Cooperation works."" The challenge, he said, and this is what Trans4m is to be commended for doing is ""to trigger a process that will lead to a different result."" In his opening remarks, Brian David Johnson, co-curator of the conference, had called the conference attendees ""a room full of people who will transform the future."" Or as will.i.am put it, ""maybe if each of us can take responsibility for being the agent of change, we can transform our schools, our neighborhoods, our cities and our world."""
