You did everything possible for your spouse. You knew how they took their coffee in the morning and what their favorite dish was. You even knew about the various events that took place in their day and expressed interest. When they were unhappy, you tried doing things for them so that they would be loving again. But no matter what you did or said it was never enough. They cheated, lied or turned to drugs and alcohol to fill them up. You finally divorce. Now after the fog has lifted and you've come out the other side, you think to yourself, ""They never knew me and what I liked... it was all about them."" Moreover, you realize that you keep attracting these same types of people into your life.This is a common repetitive phenomenon that I see in my practice at The Art of Charm. Amazing, talented caregivers attract narcissists. What is going on?Narcissists prey on caregivers because they make them feel better. They are insecure and empty, so they rely on external things (like money, sex, expensive cars, etc.) to fill them up and gain attention. When I coach people, I teach them how to detect signs of a narcissist. You can't change them, but you can change your perception so that you can spot a narcissist the minute you say hello. Here are four narcissist busters:1. Set boundaries: Treat yourself as well as you treat others. Set boundaries and declare your wants and needs. If you are a caretaker, be careful that you are not putting others before you. Let your date know what you like and dislike. Do they respect your desires or only do what they want?  2. Look for reciprocity: Narcissists are really good at being charming and telling stories and sharing what is great about them. When meeting your dates, observe if they are just as interested in you and your stories. Is there reciprocity in the conversation or is it just one-sided? What are you doing to reinforce that dynamic? Be careful to not just sit and listen to it all. Instead, try talking about your interests, express your feelings and see if they listen.  3. Don't give it all away: Don't give away your personal value by doing too much, too soon, too fast. Narcissists will eat you up. Pay attention to how you are relating to your dates or potential partners. Are you always playing therapist by listening intently, offering advice and doing things for them? You can offer these things as a loving partner but pace it out and see if they are able to offer you the same in return.  4. Test if words get put into action: Does the person you are attracted to mean what they say and say what they mean? Narcissists love to talk but rarely follow through. Remember, actions always speak louder than words.  Finally, use this time in your life as an opportunity to change the pattern of attracting narcissists. Instead, focus on what you can do during the first phase of dating in order to attract a person who likes you for you rather than what you can provide for them!Kimberly Seltzer LCSW is a Therapist, Matchmaker, Personal Image Expert and Dating Coach at The Art of Charm."
1,PARENTING,6 Tips for Dealing With Your Partner Returning to Work After Baby,"CafeMom, Contributor
CafeMom is the meting place for moms",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/6-tips-for-dealing-with_us_5b9cfaeee4b03a1dcc837c40,Here are 6 tips that will make life easier for you when your partner goes back to work.,2013-03-28,Young loving mother watching her sleeping 18 days old baby,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfaee250000320036482e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Written by Nicole Fabian-Weber on CafeMom's blog, The Stir.For those planning on going back to work after having a baby, the low-grade stress of maternity leave ending sets in almost immediately after giving birth. How will you handle it? How will your baby handle it? But before you're forced to deal with entering the work force again -- or even if you're not going back to work -- you're likely forced to deal with another issue: your partner going back to work.If you think maternity leave is a joke in this country, may I introduce you to paternity leave? Your partner can save up all the vacation and sick days he possibly can, but odds are, he isn't going to be able to stay home with you very long. And that first day you're alone with a tiny (screaming?) newborn can be terrifying.But you'll get through it. Promise.Here are 6 tips that will make life easier for you when your partner goes back to work.1. Line up friends and family members to stop by (but not all at once). My husband went back to work two weeks after our daughter was born. Up until that point, we hadn't had many visitors -- but once he left, I lined 'em up. People typically only stayed an hour or so, but having someone with me for a small period each day helped me relax a bit (and I'd get to take a shower!).2. Prepare the night before. If you think you're going to have a relaxing day alone with your newborn, let me tell you -- you're not. It's just Murphy's Law, friends. I don't want to scare anyone here, but the first day my husband went back to work, it was a sh**show. My daughter screamed from the moment she woke up until the minute he got home (and thereafter). I barely had time to get myself a glass of water, nevertheless food. If I would have made myself something the night before, it would have made things a little easier.3. If the weather is appropriate, get outside. My daughter and I went for a walk every day after my husband went back to work. We'd lug the stroller down the night before (thanks for letting us keep it in the lobby, Landlord!), and around (and around) my neighborhood we'd go. We developed a ritual, actually. We'd stop in to Dunkin' Donuts for a decaf iced coffee, then walk until she woke up. It just felt good to get outside, get a little fresh air, and talk to random people. I felt less isolated, and after a few days, I felt like: Hey, I can do this!4. Leave the TV on. I've never been a daytime TV watcher -- even on my days off, it just feels weird. But after my husband went back to work, that thing was on 24:7. It was nice to have some background noise, and I felt like I had a vague idea of what was going on outside Baby World.5. Join a mommy group. A friend of mine suggested I join a group for new moms when my daughter was 3 weeks old. I laughed in her face at the notion that I'd be able to be somewhere specific at a certain time. But looking back, I should have. I highly doubt I'd be the first person in history not to show up to a meeting if I couldn't -- and I would have bonded with people who were going through the same thing I was.6. Talk to someone. Talking to someone who's been there, done that really can help -- but you have to be honest. No need to act like you have everything under control if you don't -- you don't have to prove anything to anyone. Sometimes, just getting it all out there and admitting you're lonely/scared/anxious can be cathartic.Were you nervous when your partner went back to work?

Here are some of the important lessons we can learn from observing children.,2013-03-28,Two happy smiling little brothers sat at breakfast table eating toast.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf0b11f00005100216bcc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I love watching children. They have so many natural behaviors that can teach adults how to love food -- but not too much -- and how to fit physical activity into our day. Here are some of the important lessons we can learn from observing children: Eat when you're hungry. From the time they're born, babies and young children know when and how much they need to eat -- and they cry to let everyone else know, too. As they grow, this important instinct can be un-learned due to environmental, social, and emotional influences. By the time we're adults, we may have picked up the habit of eating for reasons other than hunger: mealtimes, reward, stress, anger, boredom, deprivation, and countless other triggers. By recognizing the difference between needing to eat and wanting to eat, adults can re-learn when and how much to eat, too.Stop eating when you're full.  An infant will turn their head away when they've had enough to eat, and a toddler will throw a plate of food on the floor when they're done. As adults, we clean our plates because ""there are starving children"" somewhere or just because something tastes good. I'm not suggesting that we start throwing our plates on the floor again, but we need to remember that food is abundant so there's no need to eat it all now.Being too hungry makes you grouchy.  Being hungry, tired, or frustrated are sure to make a child crabby -- and affect adults the same way. As parents, we do our best to make sure we are prepared with nutritious, delicious food to feed our children when they're hungry. We should plan ahead to care for ourselves that way, too.Snacks are good.  Most kids naturally prefer to eat smaller meals with snacks in between according to their hunger signals. That pattern of eating keeps their energy up and their metabolism stoked all day. Adults who need to fire up their energy and metabolism might benefit from this pattern, too.Play with your food. Most kids love to examine, smell, and touch their food. Since eating is a total sensory experience, they get the most from every morsel. This childlike approach of eating mindfully will allow you to appreciate the aroma, appearance and flavors more -- especially if you aren't driving, watching TV, or standing in front of the refrigerator. You'll probably eat less food while enjoying it more.All foods fit. Though parents sometimes worry about sugar and junk food, ""fun"" foods are part of a healthy diet. In fact, overly restrictive food rules usually lead to rebellious eating anyway -- just think about the last time you weren't ""allowed"" to eat something. Children and adults both eat healthier when they enjoy these less nutritious foods in moderation.You can learn to like new foods. Healthy eating is an acquired taste; it can take up to 10 tries of a new food before a child will incorporate it into their diet. Good nutrition is essential, so providing a variety of appealing, healthful foods will benefit the whole family. In our house, we had a two-bite rule when my kids were young. Assuming everyone at the table was hungry, everyone needed to taste two small bites of everything we served. If they still didn't like it, we didn't force or bribe them to eat it -- but they still needed to try it again the next time we had it. Since that was ""the rule,"" there were no battles at the table and the kids often surprised themselves by liking something they thought they wouldn't. As young adults, they both enjoy a wide variety of foods.Be a picky eater.  The corollary to the lesson above is that kids won't easily eat something they don't like. As adults we sometimes eat cold French fries, stale cookies, or overly-salty chili just because it's there. Be a little pickier! Think of how much less food you'd eat if you didn't settle for food that tasted just so-so. There's more to a party than cake and ice cream. Invite a child to a party and they'll want to know what they're going to get to do. Invite an adult and they'll wonder what food will be served. You don't have to avoid parties to eat healthfully. Just focus on the real purpose of social events -- to be social -- and let food be the icing on the cake.Eating with your family is fun.  Since babies and toddlers must be fed by their caregivers, they naturally love eating with other people. Family mealtime is your opportunity to model healthy habits, and more importantly, bond and connect with one another. It's boring to just sit around. Toddlers seem to be in perpetual motion as they constantly explore their world. Young kids love to run in the grass, play on the playground, and challenge themselves and each other with increasingly more complex activities. For kids, movement is for fun -- not for burning calories. Of course, as they get older, television, computers and electronic games compete for their attention. To encourage activity and exploration, limit ""screen time"" -- this applies to adults, too!Follow the leader.  Face it, kids watch and often imitate everything adults do. If they observe us eating a variety of foods and enjoying physical activity, then they'll learn to take good care of their bodies. Similarly, if they don't hear us making comments like ""I look so fat in this,"" or ""I was bad at dinner so I have to spend an extra hour on the treadmill,"" then they are less likely to suffer from poor self-esteem or a negative attitude about exercise.Sleep is good. After a full day, children need a good night's sleep to prepare for all of the adventures that tomorrow will hold. Wouldn't we all benefit from a consistent bedtime to make sure we get our rest, too?Live in the moment. Kids are masters at living in the present. They don't waste a lot of energy worrying about what has already happened or what might happen tomorrow. They are fully engaged in small pursuits like discovering where the ants are going, chasing the dog, or seeing how deep they can dig with a plastic shovel. We, on the other hand, continue to scurry around, chasing after our dreams, all the while digging ourselves deeper and deeper. We can learn a lot from children!Michelle May, M.D. is the founder of the Am I Hungry?

(Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cce81250000330036377a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As I've written many times on Huffington Post and elsewhere, I have two great loves in life: I love travel, and I love the United States Supreme Court. (OK, I'm pretty passionate about my husband, our two kids, our three dogs, and the guys who play at Fenway Park, too, but that's not what this story is about.)   It's pretty rare that my love for one overtakes my love for the other.But that's what happened in Kenya, in December, on a Cheli and Peacock safari I booked through Extraordinary Journeys.I went to Kenya on a retreat, so to speak. Work was more stressful than it had been in years, although only temporarily so. My husband and kids were wrapped up in French horn rehearsal and skating practice and pre-algebra. I was on school vacation, but my mind was still reeling from too many things on my to-do list. And so I flew across the world, in part to decompress, in part to lose myself in the animals and the people and the landscape that was Africa.I started my African adventure at Elsa's Kopje, a lodge-like camp in the Meru, the national park where Joy Adamson did her work and where a rhino sanctuary is home to almost seventy of the endangered giants. And although I'd never before heard of the Meru, I soon realized it would be hard to forget. From my room's balcony, I looked out over a massive green valley, full of Cape buffalo and impala. From my king-sized bed, I listened to lions roar at night. From the privately guided Land Rover, I watched mother elephants guard their babies and shepherd them from the rain. I thought about my children and wondered whether they were remembering to wear their rain boots. And then I went out looking for cheetah.I did not read the news. I did not think about what was happening in Washington, D.C., at the United States Supreme Court, where things were ramping up. When I got a weak internet signal, I did not open the questioning emails that were starting to pile up in my inbox. Next stop:  Joy's Camp, in the Shaba, where birds sang all night long. I slept in a tent in the spot where Joy Adamson had camped, then listened to the cheetahs who learned from Elsa to come at night. I bundled myself into my bed. I felt safe and calm as the wild cats screeched. In the middle of the day, I learned not about jurisdiction or state sovereignty but about proper use of binoculars and bush croquet. I ate. A lot. I watched the birds. I recorded their songs to play for my daughters back in the States. I did not read the news. The emails continued to pile up.On a tiny four-seater plane to Laikipia, I saw herds of zebras and elephants running across the plain. At Loisaba Lodge, I sat on a high, wooden deck and watched buffalo drink at the nearby watering hole. I rode a camel through the bush, then ate granola and eggs riverside, served by Samburu tribe members who pointed out bee hives and swallows' nests. I attended a Samburu wedding. I shared in the joy of the tribesmen and women, of the children who danced around the village green. I tried to jump as high as the tribal dancers. I feasted on roasted goat.Warmed by two hot water bottles, I slept in a treehouse in a ""star bed,"" a four-poster covered in green mosquito mesh and open to the stars. It was my wedding anniversary. I wished on a Kenyan star that my husband and I would celebrate another sixteen years together, perhaps surrounded by grandchildren. I did not read the news. The emails continued to multiply.   I ended my trip in the Masai Mara, the fabled center of the great migration. Although the zebras and wildebeest were relatively quiet, they roamed all around us, even approaching my tent at Cottar's Camp, where the next morning I found evidence of their visit. I watched a pride of lions wander across the border from Kenya to Tanzania and a coalition of cheetahs attack an impala kill. In the main tent, I sat back in British Colonial elegance. And I checked my email. As it turned out, the Supreme Court had granted certiorari in the gay marriage cases a few days before, on the very same day I attended a Samburu wedding and celebrated the anniversary of my own. It was the first time in many years that I had failed to be on my computer at the very moment that a major Court event had occurred. The students and professors and bloggers and journalists with whom I worked had been worried about me. Why wasn't I online?I wasn't online, I answered eventually, because I had been losing myself in Kenya. Losing myself in the zebras, and the cheetahs, and the lions, and the mother elephants. Finding peace. Back home, I started to write. It was time to think about the Supreme Court and marriage equality for all.If you go to Kenya: • Book a safari with a reputable tour company.  Extraordinary Journeys works with Cheli and Peacock and can customize a safari to camps and lodges of your choice. The stellar service includes booking all transfers between camps and the airports.  • Pack very little. Especially during high season, you will not be allowed to take more than 30 pounds of luggage, including carry-ons. All camps offer free laundry service; plan to use it and take only a few items of clothing. Leave room for souvenirs! • Explore the country. Before I went to Kenya, everyone told me that the Masai Mara was where all the action took place. Yes, the Mara was fantastic for wildlife viewing, but so were the other areas I visited. By spreading out my trip, I saw a larger variety of animals and met some incredible people.  • Support the local economy. Kenyan natives are skilled artisans; plan to bring back wood carvings and beaded items as gifts.  • Buy a good camera and a great pair of binoculars.  Although they were relatively heavy, I couldn't have seen half of what I saw in the bush without a decent pair of ""binos."" The photos I took were priceless - and my kids loved seeing the video when I got home."

Everything is new and worthy of discovery. Even better, that pesky motor control thing that has caused such frustration for the first few years is finally coming under control. Six is a big kid who is off to school, can ride a bike, and can fix things with dad. Six can spell their name, fold socks and put on their own pajamas. Six is good.But what if 6 is all there is? All that there ever will be? People accept an 8-year-old who still acts 6. They are just ""young for their age."" They will tolerate a 10-year-old who still acts 6 if the parent looks exhausted enough. But a 13-year-old who is still acting like a 6-year-old is a serious social problem. I know, because this child is my son.My son was born too early. The twin who got the short end of the genetic and in-utero stick. The weakest link, if you will. Totally not his fault. He holds no blame in this. He did nothing wrong. He just got a bad draw of the cards. Unfortunately, he will have an entire lifetime to play this hand. After a complicated infancy, which included frequent hospitalizations, a tracheostomy, a feeding tube, round the clock nursing care and much, much more, he has blossomed into the 6-year-old we call our boy. Mentally deficient, socially challenged and physically different; these are the traits that define who he is -- at least these are the traits that society uses to define him. I have read the stories written by parents of children with special needs. They refer to these children as ""a blessing from God,"" their reason for being, their light at the end of every day. I wish those parents all the best and am happy for them that they can look at life this way. For better or worse, I'm not one of those parents. Don't get me wrong; I don't wish my child any harm. I love him and will care for him as long as he needs me to, but this is a tough row to hoe and someone needs to present the other side of the story. Here's the thing. Getting through the physical challenges was the easy part. Didn't see that one coming, right? It seemed hard at the time but looking back now, it really wasn't. When your child is sick and needs another surgery, a different medication, more therapy (insert any number of choices here), you just do it. You go into full-on parent mode, you advocate for your child, you get them the lifesaving healthcare that they need. And you pray that they don't die. You pray every minute of every day that they don't die. A parent caring for a medically intensive infant or child is focused, driven and motivated. You have a clear goal. But what comes next? For many us it is the sequelae of those medically intensive years that define our later lives. Brain damage and low IQ from lack of oxygen to the brain at critical times during development result in educational challenges that will careen the calmest parent to the limits of their patience. Physical limitations from muscles that were too busy breathing to worry about things like dexterity or coordination means that the child in question will never make the team or be the best at any sport or musical instrument. Watching your child be rejected over and over can really tear up a parent's heart. Relationship skills that are rooted in medical care and constant parental supervision don't lend themselves very well to play dates and peer relationships. Who are your friends when you have no friends? Your parents fill that void too. And don't even get me started on the bullying issue. What comes next indeed?Some day, I will leave this earth. I will leave behind a child who will be a 6-year-old in a man's body. We're back to that social problem again. Where does someone like this live? Where do they work? Can they work? How will they not get taken advantage of every single day? These are all things that I struggle with on a daily basis. For now, I plan. I try to teach the boy to become a man, and I hope for the best. I love the child that is my son for who he is, for his joy and discovery, and I live for the good days. Meanwhile, the perpetual 6-year-old in my life is happy to ride his bike and play a video game. But then, what 6-year-old wouldn't be?"

That word is ""no""! The ability to be assertive and say ""no"" is a communication skill we all learn at a very young age. If you're a parent, you know better than anyone that once this word enters a child's vocabulary it's used very often. However, as an adult, ""no"" is often much more difficult to say. As life gets busier and obligations increase, the ability to say ""no"" is increasingly important. If you can learn to assert yourself, it can be the difference between chronic overwhelm (aka, not having an enjoyable life) and spending far more time with the things you enjoy and that fulfill you the most.Between keeping up with your email, your career and family, your friends and your relationship(s), the many requests for your time that you receive on a regular basis can feel daunting. Perhaps the kids need you to drive them and their friends to the movies, your neighbors want you to walk their dog and your boss is pleading with you to take a work project home to complete in order to meet a deadline. Perhaps you agree to take on more than you can handle, merely because you don't want to be rejecting or somehow become scorned by someone's wrathful reaction. The fear of being rejected by others is one that we become most sensitive to in adolescence, which I discuss in detail in my book Stage Climbing: The Shortest Path to Your Highest Potential. But when this fear is too prominent as an adult, it can certainly hold you back. The key to being able to pick and choose what you can and cannot take on, is remembering that when you say ""no"" you aren't rejecting the person, you are simply rejecting their request. For example, if someone asks you to lend them $100, you might say ""no."" But if that person were to ask if you could pay him to do some yard work for you, you might agree to this. So by saying no the loan, you were merely rejecting an undesirable request. A more attractive request -- paying money for yard work you need done -- where there's a benefit to you could be one you might easily accept. In this example, as with most requests you probably consider, it's less personal than practical. The problem is, we tend to easily forget that.Being able to carefully consider and mindfully choose which obligations or requests you take on from the people in your life will allow you to feel empowered and positive about the things you decide to say ""yes"" to. When you are unapologetically the one who's in charge of your life and your decisions, you will get a level of respect that may have previously eluded you. In reality, there are so many things coming at you today that weren't there just a few short years ago. This means that managing your schedule is far more challenging than it was before. Most importantly, strive to feel great about how you choose to spend your time, as time is the one asset we have, that when lost -- we can't get it back. So who can you say no to today?For more by Michael S. Broder, Ph.D., click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."
6,PARENTING,Five Positive Money Lessons Parents Are Teaching Their Kids,"Neale Godfrey, Contributor

This week, I want to review and reinforce the healthy steps that parents are taking to help their kids to grow up financially literate. 1. Allowance and Budget The best way to make sure that your kids understand the reality that Money Doesn't Grow On Trees is to put them on an allowance and to teach them how to budget their money. No one gets a ""free ride"" in life and by giving your kids an allowance you are teaching them the ""work for pay"" principle. Your child's allowance is tied to chores and will show the relationship between work (chores) and money (allowance), clearly an important concept. Not only will the child someday work for money, but earning an allowance will underscore the fact that you, the parent, work hard for your money, too.A budget is a healthy way of handling money. Routines, if they are started when your kids are young, stay with them all their lives. There are four components to my budget system: Charity, Quick Cash, Medium-Term Savings and Long-Term Savings. Ten percent of all money the children earn should go to charity. Then divide the balance among the remaining three categories. Discuss your kid's Medium-Term and Long-Term savings goals.2. Need Versus Want Kids learn ""I want"" almost as soon as they learn to talk -- or as soon as they see the inside of a store, or their first TV commercial. If you tell them ""You want it, but you don't need it,"" they learn ""I neeeed"" almost as quickly -- and their first definition of ""I need"" is the same as ""I want,"" but more persistent. You have to teach the distinction. A Need: Something without which your daily living would be impossible, or very, very difficult.A Want: Something that if you had, you'd be happier momentarily, but if you didn't, you could live without.Remember, your child might want the most expensive, popular brand of new sneakers but wouldn't a less expensive pair work just as well? 3. Gender Equality Societal expectations and gender roles have certainly come a long way since I first entered the executive work force, but according to the AAUW, in direct comparison, women still make 7percent less than their male counterparts. Gone are the days when Dad went off to work while Mom stayed home to keep the house clean and raise the kids. Now, 70.6 percent of mothers are working, and some fathers even choose the reverse role of staying at home. In 1972, the Ms. Foundation for Women released the groundbreaking illustrated book and record album Free to Be...You and Me which featured ""Marlo Thomas and Friends."" The basic concept was to encourage gender neutrality, individuality, tolerance and comfort with one's identity. The prime message is that anyone -- boy or girl -- can achieve anything.This is such a strong and enduring message. Empower your girls and impart the knowledge of equality in your boys. Remember that you are teaching the future work force and that kids learn from the example you lead -- maybe your child's generation will see gender pay parity. It's about time. 4. Charity We need to teach our children all the ways money can work positively: it works to cover immediate expenses, like lunch money; it works to build for the future, like saving for college; and it can be shared with others to help those in need. Charitable giving is a lesson with great impact to a child or young adult and, it is an opportunity for you to impart your personal values to your youngster. Charity is an easy concept to explain to children, who are very aware that it's good to help others. But, it doesn't come naturally -- it has to be taught -- this is why it is included in my budget system.Charitable donations can be made in many ways, from giving change to a homeless person on the street (a powerful visual lesson), to giving to a specific charity that you and your child choose together. Remember that charity can also mean giving of yourself and your time as well as money. This is a great family project and fodder for family dinner table discussion.5. The Greening of Money I teach parents and kids to look at the world from both an ECOnomic and and ECOlogical point of view. We strive to keep our family budget in balance -- spending and saving equals earning. If you spend more than you earn, your budget is ""unbalanced"" -- and you go into debt.By producing more pollution that can be absorbed and recycled, we are going into ""debt"" with our planet. Teaching kids to be aware of their environment can save precious natural resources and save money. Recycling, reusing and reducing waste have a huge impact on our world. Teach your kids to recognize the Shmootz in their world and give them the tools to help clean it up. Are you proud of money lessons you're teaching your kids? We'd like to hear from you in the space provided."

(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf44c250000360036458d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like the rest of America, I've watched the story that's come to be known as the Steubenville Rape Case play out. As a woman, a mother, and as a human being, I have been shocked and saddened and infuriated as the details of this crime slowly trickled out. At the end, I waited anxiously for a verdict to be announced, hoping that some kind of justice would be done. When the verdict finally did come down, I happened to be watching CNN and, like many other people, my initial reaction at Candy Crowley and Poppy Harlow's sympathizing with the defendants as they broke down upon hearing themselves found guilty, was one of shock and indignation. I mean, of course it was. How could it not be? From start to finish, everything about this case is just so horrific. The rape itself -- the complete and total minimization of this young woman as a human being. The cover-up -- the initial denial and the subsequent ""blame the victim"" tricks and tactics. The aftermath -- the sympathy for the perpetrators and the death threats the victim (THE VICTIM!!) has received. Every bit of it just makes me sick to my stomach. If there were ever two people less deserving of sympathy, it would seem to be these rapists. ""Their lives are ruined,"" you say? What about the girl they raped? What about her life? They do not deserve your words of sympathy -- your distress over the loss of their ""promising futures.""And yet . . . As a bit of time has passed, somewhere, deep down, I realize that I do  feel a measure of compassion for these boys. Now, not much, to be sure. Not nearly to the degree that Crowley and Harlow seem to have felt. I certainly don't mourn for them. You will not hear me crying for the loss of their ""promising futures."" But, when I watch the coverage again and I see their tears and hear their sobs, I do feel a certain sense of sadness. Because, while what they did was reprehensible and ugly and worthy of our disdain and disgust, it wasn't done in a bubble. These boys, most likely, didn't spring, fully-formed, from their mother's wombs as rapists and sex offenders. They seem (to me at least) to be, very much, a product of their environment. You see, not only did these young men grow up in a culture that minimizes women every single day -- in ways large and small -- they also grew up in a community that elevates athletes to god-like status and sends them the tacit message that they -- as men and as sports heroes -- are ""better than."" In theory and in actuality they seem to have been taught that not only would they not be held to the same standards as everyone else, but if they did screw up, the adults in their lives would, quickly and seemingly without compunction, close ranks to protect them. Even if it meant further destroying the life of a young woman in the process. Furthermore, these young men were, apparently, brought up and protected by adults who did not feel it necessary to teach them any modicum of respect for the decency and rights of a woman to not be raped and used and defiled. The village that raised these children didn't seem to care enough about those bright futures to teach them that those futures are, in fact, not available to boys who drag an unconscious girl around, raping and photographing and humiliating her for their own, sickening amusement. If that's not pitiable, I don't know what is. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not offering any of this an excuse -- by any means. To recognize that the adults in their lives appear to have completely and totally failed these boys does not diminish the depravity that they exhibited. Not in the slightest. But maybe it explains the sense of sadness expressed by Crowley and Harlow, and that I feel, deep down. Because, when you get right down to it, it is pretty heartbreaking to think that we have to teach our sons not to rape and that we have to explain to them that women are their equal and are worthy of their respect -- regardless of whether those women are drunk, sober, or something in between. It's scary to realize that we live in a culture that subtly and insidiously teaches them otherwise. But it's our reality. And, because of that, it's our responsibility as parents to teach all of our children that actions have consequences and that even the brightest future isn't worth more than the dignity of a fellow human being to remain whole and unharmed.Yes, the fact that this terrible thing happened at all, and that the subsequent reaction of this town -- and of the adults whose job it was to shape and mold these young men into something other than the criminals that they became -- was to lie and cover up and excuse and blame the victim is a sad, sad state of affairs indeed."

And differing views of what is best for children? And a nostalgia for times past? And disagreement over what it means to be a successful woman? No, says MORE magazine, wading into the decades-old debate. The Mommy Wars are about money. Editors there partnered with Citi’s Women & Co. and polled 557 adults with children ages 6 months to 16 years. The results hint that the ongoing skirmishes between mothers who are and are not employed outside the home are far more economic than philosophical. “These Mommy War issues have been festering for so long we wanted to get actual data,” says Lesley Jane Seymour, MORE’s editor-in-chief. “When you get behind the issues you see there’s a financial root there.”You have to start from the premise that “this is a war of privilege,” Seymour says, because only women who have the means to forgo a salary and stay home are able to engage in the fighting. For that reason, The Polling Company, which conducted this survey, only included households with incomes of more than $75K, so as to compare the choices of women who could be considered to actually have a choice. Of those, 91 percent of the women who work for pay said their families are dependent on their salaries. If money were no object, 54 percent of working mothers would make a different choice, compared with 9 percent of mothers who stay at home. Those who felt more financially secure were more likely to choose to stay home, the survey found, though, interestingly, how secure a respondent felt was not directly related to her household income. Once you are in this income bracket, the results seemed to show, security becomes relative. “The women who felt most insecure were often the women with more money,” Seymour says. The survey found that 54 percent of those with incomes between $75,000 and $99,000 a year said they feel ""somewhat financially secure,"" compared to 51 percent of those with incomes between $100,000 and $199,000. A related root cause, the survey found, was men. Twenty percent of the sample was male, and they report conflicted views of working and stay-at-home mothers. The latter, they say, are “better mothers” who are “happier” and have “better behaved kids.” The former, on the other hand, deserve “more respect,” “work harder” and “have a more exciting life.” When men are “sending conflicting signals,” Seymour says, “it would follow that women are responding to them. And instead of talking to the men around us, we’re taking it out on each other.” So perhaps the solution, she suggests, is to understand the role of impression and perception -- and men, and money. “No problem goes away unless you talk about it, and unless you dig in and find the reasons for its existence” Seymour says. “We are not trying to throw fuel on the Mommy Wars fire, we are trying to extinguish them.” What role does money play in your choice to work or stay home? How much is your choice influenced by the perceptions of others? Does the MORE analysis ring true in your life? Is this news to you, or something everyone should already know? "

I could have made it from scratch this whole time! Warning: store-bought matzo will never taste the same again.,2013-03-27,Matzos Close up on white background (this picture has been shot with a 31 megapixels super high definition Hasselblad HD3 II camera),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf89626000035007fafec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Matzo -- who knew?! -- is really just made of flour and water. I feel a little jipped that I have had to buy it all these years, when I could have made it from scratch this whole time! I think we all have these ingredients lying around at home, and if not, they are super easy to find. Let's go crazy and add just two more ingredients that you probably have lying around too, and toppings if you so desire. I have been saying for years that I wanted to make matzo from scratch, as I believe that food is always best fresh, but just never made the time. So, this year, I finally did. There is something so comforting and satisfying about this simple recipe, and it is so versatile too, for savory or sweet. Warning: store-bought matzo will never taste the same again.Recipe:• 2 3/4 cups oat flour, whole wheat bread flour, spelt flour, or a combination of one or all three • 1 cup lukewarm water • 3 tab extra virgin olive oil • ½ tsp finely ground sea salt • Savory toppings: such as poppy seeds, sesame seeds, rosemary, sea salt, and the list goes on to whatever you'd like... • Dessert toppings: chocolate covered matzo is easy and always a crowd-pleaser, and this time we added some coconut: 8 oz of of semi-sweet or dark chocolate, ½ cup shredded unsweetened coconut, 1 tab coconut oil/unsalted butter, and sea salt.How to make it :1. Homemade matzo is a very forgiving and easy recipe. You can pull this off mixing by hand in a large bowl; in a standing mixer with a dough attachment; or in a food processor. Mix the flour, water, olive oil and sea salt together on medium-high speed for 4-5 minutes. Preheat oven to 500 F. Once dough creates sticky balls (you may need to add a little more water or flour, depending on your dough to get the right consistency...add 1 tab addition of either one until you get the right consistency: soft and supple). 2. Divide dough into 12 portions. With a floured rolling pin, roll out dough on well-floured parchment paper to the flattest you can get it, around 8"" thick is easiest to work with. Lightly sprinkle with sea salt, and your savory toppings, if you are adding them, and press the toppings into the dough. With a fork, poke dough all over (normally a square of store-bought matzo is poked 500 times!) so that there aren't air pockets and the dough won't rise. Bake on parchment paper on a baking sheet for 6-8 minutes just until edges are golden brown and the matzo becomes crispy. Let cool completely. 3. If making dessert matzo, do not add any savory toppings. Instead, when the plain matzo is done baking, start heating the chocolate and coconut oil or butter in a double boiler just until melted. Let cool slightly. Drizzle over the matzo and sprinkle the coconut over the chocolate, with a pinch of sea salt on top. Place in the refrigerator for 15-30 minutes until the chocolate has hardened. 4. Break a part and enjoy!"
11,WELLNESS,6 Things Your Dreams Can Tell You About Your Health,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dream-meaning-health-dreams_us_5b9cf914e4b03a1dcc836904,"Your Blood Sugar Could Be Low If people with diabetes experience a serious dip in blood sugar, one possible symptom can be",2013-03-27,Sun shines above the soft clouds before sunset in Tenerife. Classic soft focus effect.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf9143c0000660009f7cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The last time you woke up from a dream, you may have wondered why exactly you were back at high school, standing in front of your locker, unable for the life of you to remember the combination. When it comes to dream meanings, most of us expect those visions to reveal mental health truths, whether they be feelings about a life event, relationship or simply a memory.But after recent research highlighted a potential link between acting out dreams and a common form of dementia, perhaps there is more we can learn about our physical health from our dreams.The research, presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, found that men with a risk factor for dementia with Lewy bodies, in addition to what's known as REM sleep behavior disorder, are five times more likely to have this type of dementia. The same sleep disorder has also been linked to Parkinson's disease, symptoms of which are similar to those of dementia with Lewy bodies.Anecdotally, some say that dreams have predicted cancer, alerted a patient to tuberculosis or even warned of a heart attack. There's little -- if any -- scientific evidence that certain dream symbols can be interpreted to predict any real health symptoms. But there is some concrete proof that more dreams, stranger dreams or recurring dreams could have important meaning when it comes to your physical health.You Have A Fever If you're the type to ignore the signs that you're under the weather, maybe a freaky nightmare will prove the point. Being sick can trigger nightmares, according to the Mayo Clinic, especially if your illness is accompanied by a fever. If you weren't paying attention to what your body was trying to tell you before, the morning after that weird nightmare is the time to tune in!Stress Is Getting The Best Of You You might also be ignoring signs that you're more than a little stressed out. When we ignore what's taxing us, those stressors can follow us to bed. Sometimes, stress can manifest itself as common dream themes like missing a plane or an oncoming tidal wave, according to DoctorOz.com. Other times, a particularly bizarre dream might help you realize it's time to slow down. Some say that stress dreams might actually be helpful if they reveal what's truly bothering you and point to why you're feeling that way.Your Blood Sugar Could Be Low If people with diabetes experience a serious dip in blood sugar, one possible symptom can be bad dreams and nightmares, according to WebMD. Taking too much insulin or certain medications can cause this drop, called hypoglycemia. Of course, most people with diabetes will learn to recognize early symptoms of low blood sugar before nightmares point out the problem. But hypoglycemia can occur during sleep.Pregnant? Good News! Many a mother can attest to dreaming more while pregnant. Over those nine months, dreams seem to increase in general, but strange or vivid dreams can become particularly common. Although more -- and scarier -- dreams aren't necessarily pleasant, a mom-to-be with strange or upsetting dreams might actually be in luck: An Israeli study of 166 pregnant women found that the more harrowing dreams a woman had, the less likely she was to develop postpartum depression. And an Italian study of 290 women linked more dreams (and more upsetting dreams) with shorter labor times.It May Be Time To Consult A Mental Health Specialist If stress and anxiety can cause such strange and often upsetting dreams, it should come as no surprise that more serious mental health conditions can similarly interrupt your sleep. Bipolar disorder is known to cause vivid or bizarre dreams in some people, according to WebMD. And a study of Vietnam veterans found that 52 percent of combat vets with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had nightmares fairly often, compared to only 3 percent of civilians, according to the U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs. If you find yourself experiencing nightmares or very vivid dreams frequently, considering discussing your sleep with your doctor. Seeking treatment for both of these conditions can improve the quality of your sleep."
