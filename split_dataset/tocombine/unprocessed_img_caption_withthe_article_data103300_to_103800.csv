But honestly, if there is a curse of ""Thrones,"" it's a lifetime of having to talk about it.Though it may sound a little more like a first world problem than a ""curse,"" talking about ""GoT"" is definitely something Harington is going to have to get used to. The actor has already said he's contractually obligated not to cut his hair for the show, and he goes on in the interview to say that this makes him much more recognizable to fans.Check out the full British GQ interview, available Thursday, Dec. 4. And to see more of Harington, check out Season 5 of ""GoT,"" which is set to debut in spring 2015 on HBO.  "

Will they walk away from the challenges in Afghanistan? Or will they recommit to helping the country and its new president address persistent human rights problems that will plague the country's future, even if the security situation stabilizes? Many in the United States are ready for the US to get out of Afghanistan: 13 years have passed since the Taliban was ousted from Kabul and yet insurgency and lawlessness persist. The US has spent over $700 billion in military and development aid in Afghanistan since 2001. But much of the fault for the county's continuing challenges lies not only with the Afghan government but also with US officials who repeatedly sacrificed long-term stability for short-term military aims. The US should not turn away from its obligations to the Afghan people, and the most important way to do that is to focus on justice and human rights protections. This will help protect Afghans and make Afghanistan more stable and less prone to the influence of nefarious actors. Let us not forget that the reason behind US involvement in Afghanistan was that the country had become a haven for Al-Qaeda. A new report by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Democratic Party staff urges conditioning continued assistance to Afghanistan on key reforms for better rights protections. This is a good recommendation. Although the bulk of the US military mission has ended, the US is still expected to appropriate billions of dollars over the next several years to Afghanistan. To ensure that those taxpayer dollars are well-spent, the US should not leave London without obtaining firm commitments from the new Afghan government to take steps to implement existing reforms, develop key benchmarks to assess progress, and press forward with new ones. In a recent letter to foreign ministers attending the London conference, Human Rights Watch outlined several areas where human rights risk falling by the wayside. Key among them are for the new Afghan government of President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah, to seek accountability for security force abuses and protect and promote the rights of women and girls. To further these goals -- and protect their investments -- donor nations, including the US, should support the development of a new, independent monitoring and reporting mechanism that can assess Afghanistan's developments in key areas where reform is needed. Public reporting, coupled with clear recommendations to both the Afghan government and donor nations, would allow donor nations to hold the Afghan government, and their own, to account.During the election campaign, Ghani pledged to prosecute members of the Afghan security forces responsible for torture and other human rights violations. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has already published reports that show new instances of torture and enforced disappearances by the security forces and that not a single member of the Afghan security forces has been prosecuted for such abuses. Donor countries should ensure that commitments to Afghanistan's security forces include holding accountable Afghan security force personnel implicated in serious human rights violations -- including those with command responsibility over abusive forces. Donors should support the creation of a civilian complaints mechanism to allow victims to report abuse by all Afghan security forces and encourage a comprehensive and consistent response. The leaders of irregular armed groups should also be held accountable for abuses. Another hallmark of progress in Afghanistan concerns the rights of women and girls. It is heartening that both Ghani and Abdullah have signaled their support for key reforms, including enforcing the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) Law; supporting women's shelters; increasing the number of women in security forces, judicial and legal posts and civil service; and implementation of a plan to include women in peace-building in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325. These are important pledges, and the US should press Ghani and Abdullah for concrete steps to achieve these goals. In London, the US should urge Ghani to promptly issue a decree directing police and prosecutors to fully and vigorously enforce the EVAW Law, and to speak out publicly about the importance of access to shelter for women and girls fleeing violence. Every province should have at least one of these shelters, and women and girls need to know where they are and how they can access them. And as Ghani and Abdullah make political appointments; they should be encouraged to appoint women at all levels of Afghanistan's judicial and law enforcement institutions, including the Supreme Court. US involvement in the war in Afghanistan may be coming to an end, but US commitment to improving human rights in Afghanistan should not. The London conference is an opportunity for donor nations to make real pledges, not just of dollars, but of dedication to promoting fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in Afghanistan. Afghanistan remains a troubled country, but the gains it has achieved in the last decade should not be undersold. Those gains are precarious, and without sustained efforts from donors, Afghanistan may slide back into the abyss, taking the rights of its people along with it."

That made their record... 3-9. When they were 1-9, it was franchise's worst opening season record since they were the Minneapolis Lakers and dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Why are they so non-competitive and will they rebuild quickly?The Lakers are arguably the most storied franchise in the NBA. Only the Boston Celtics can argue this. They have won sixteen NBA titles. They paired Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain together -- three Hall of Famers -- to fight it out with the Celtics for League primacy. They then reloaded with ""Showtime."" Three Hall of Fame players -- Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Magic Johnson and James Worthy were coached by Pat Riley to multiple championship teams. They rebuilt again with Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neil leading them to more championships. They have the heart and soul of Los Angeles fans, even though the Los Angeles Clippers have Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and a much better team. New Owner Steve Ballmer has a chance to change the balance.The opening has occurred in the Lakers-Clippers balance because the Lakers are not figured to be competitive for several years. They had a losing season last year. The tickets to the games are incredibly expensive, and as much loyalty as the Lakers have engendered, Los Angeles fans tend to venerate winning and stars. The Lakers have one legend, Bryant, and have made the decision that showing him gratitude for his almost twenty years of excellence is more important than winning now. The contract he is being paid, the most expensive in the NBA at $23.5 million, makes it difficult to add quality free agents.Why have the Lakers become non-competitive on a regular basis? Historically, they have traded away first-round draft picks and relied on veteran players through trades or free agency. This policy means no superstar college draftees will be available to rebuild for the foreseeable future. The Lakers traded for point guard Steve Nash and gave away first-round picks. Nash has been injured and unproductive for the last two years and will not play at all this season while he collects almost $10 million. The Lakers traded for point guard Jeremy Lin to start this year and he has been a non-factor in most games; he is more of a low-percentage shooting guard than a point guard.In the offseason, the Lakers let super power forward Pau Gasol escape in free agency to the Chicago Bulls. They attempted to replace him with aging Carlos Boozer. Boozer has played weak defense and barely scored. Boozer was designed to fill that gap while first-round draft pick Julius Randle, a power forward, was brought along. Randle is out for the season after breaking his leg on opening night.Nick Young, the Lakers' enthusiastic scoring machine and sixth man has been injured and his return coincides with the two recent victories.And then there's Kobe. Bryant has been taking shot after shot and dominating the offense. When one player wants the ball every play, it is hard to build rhythm and get all the players involved. Bryant took 35 shots against Golden State Warriors last week and the remainder of the players took 34. Reports are that team chemistry, communication and trust have been major problems.So enjoy the swan song of Bryant. He has moments of greatness that evoke the dominating superstar he has been. But, get used to a Lakers team that is allowing the most points per game in the NBA and has trouble scoring.For Laker haters like Mark Cuban, this is glorious entertainment. For fans of NBA excellence and Laker greatness, it is sad."
5,TASTE,Chateau Phelan Segur Keeps Tradition Through Evolution,"John Mariani, ContributorPublisher of ""Mariani's Virtual Gourmet Newsletter"" and award-...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tradition-through-evolution_b_6233218.html,"The French expression ""the more things change the more they remain the same"" may be readily applied to the way an esteemed Bordeaux wine estate like Château Phélan Ségur has evolved.",2014-12-01,2014-11-27-PHELANSEGUReroniqueDausseetThierryGardinier.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-27-PHELANSEGUReroniqueDausseetThierryGardinier-thumb.jpg,"The French expression ""plus ça change plus c'est la même chose"" -- the more things change the more they remain the same -- may be readily applied to the way an esteemed Bordeaux wine estate like Château Phélan Ségur has evolved by using the most up-to-date technology and viticultural science while rigorously maintaining its essential character.Indeed, the whole idea of terroir -- meaning the confluence of place, soil, climate and history in a region -- is manifest in a wine that always tastes the same, only better. Phélan Ségur, in the region of Saint Éstephe, was founded in 1810 by an Irishman named Bernard Phelan, whose family ran it until 1919. Two more owners followed, then in 1985 Xavier Gardinier purchased the estate, and worked hard to renovate the property and vineyards and improve the wines by using the most modern technology available. In fact, he did not even release the '83, '84 and '85 vintages because they were not good enough. Today, the château is run by Thierry Gardinier, Xaviar's eldest son, and Véronique Dausse, since 2010 Director of Phélan Ségur, with whom I had a dinner recently in New York. As we sipped glasses of Phélan Ségur, Ms. Dausse said, We are drinking tradition, history, and culture. These are things we can never betray. So, are we making our wines better? I prefer to say the vines are more healthy and the wines more consistent, precise. We are not changing the basics of what makes Phélan Ségur special.That distinctiveness -- a full-bodied, very luscious, silky-soft wine--derives from cabernet sauvignon and merlot grapes whose mineral edge comes from a soil made of gravel and sandy clay over a bedrock of chalk, a composition created in an age when the region was covered by ocean. Luc Peyronnet, vineyard manager since 1993, analyzed all the hectares of soil and introduced the GreenSeeker system, which measures and interprets precisely the vigor of the vine throughout the year, helping Peyronnet to control the nutritional requirements of the plants. The harvested grapes are brought to the winery, where a new, gentle de-stemmer and an optical sorter are used to assure quality and freshness. The juice is transferred to new, smaller tanks that distinguish the micro-parcels identified by the Greenseeker analysis. The wine then spends 18 months in 50 percent new French oak barrels, then goes through the age-old process of racking, by which the wine is manually separated from its lees, rather than go through harsh pumping. The château has also made, since 1986, a lighter version of red wine called Frank Phélan (the founder's son), using a component of grapes from vines that are still too young to be included in Phélan Ségur.Ms. Dausse also spoke of the effects of global warming, which can be a double-edged sword in Bordeaux, where vintners crave more sun and heat in order to produce healthy, ripe fruit. ""We know global warming is happening,"" she said, ""and we are all for using ripe fruit, but we have to be careful that the alcohol level in the wine does not rise to the point where the fruit, acids and other components are unbalanced."" The guiding principle then -- and one that New World wineries have not the history for -- is to keep Phélan Ségur what it has always been, so that its characteristics do not just express a larger Bordeaux flavor profile and a more focused St. Éstephe character, but also that of the individual terroir that the estate encompasses.   It is a style and flavor that Ms. Dausse insists must always be the same, despite differences in vintages, and that the global market recognizes its quality as a Grand Vin du Bordeaux.  Protecting those traditions and legacy has become tasking in the global market, especially in China, where forgery of French wines is rampant. ""We have spent thousands of euros fighting these forgeries,"" says Dausse. ""We've found they've even copied the printing on our corks!"" (For consumers outside of China, Phélan Ségur is still quite a bargain for a well-regarded Bordeaux, usually priced from $35 to $65, depending on the vintage and store.)To keep its story told, the estate welcomes professional and private visitors to the château for a personalized tour of the vineyard, which includes a technical visit with the vineyard manager, a cooking lesson from the château's chef and tastings."
6,SPORTS,Adrian Peterson: Privacy vs. Community Standards,"Leigh Steinberg, ContributorSports and Entertainment Agent",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adrian-petersonprivacy-v-_b_6220074.html,The dramatic circumstances of the Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson cases raise the issue of which aspects of an athlete's private life should be subject to public awareness and judgment.,2014-12-01,"ARLINGTON, TX - NOVEMBER 3: Adrian Peterson #28 of the Minnesota Vikings walks off the field after a game against the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium on November 3, 2013 in Arlington, Texas. The Cowboys defeated the Vikings 27-23. (Photo by Wesley Hitt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb775722400005100570640.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The dramatic circumstances of the Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson cases raise the issue of which aspects of an athlete's private life should be subject to public awareness and judgment. The lines between public and private have been blurred with the development of social media and cellphone technology. When an athlete leaves his home, every moment can be captured on a phone or tablet camera providing images and sound. Free agent quarterback Matt Leinart was relaxing in his own home in his private time when a jacuzzi photo of he and several woman was captured that led to mistaken impression. These images can then be uploaded to the internet and travel across the country.Clearly when a law is broken, it becomes a public matter. Rice and Peterson broke laws and were arrested. This is a change from the ""good old days"" in sports when domestic violence and abusive parenting were kept in the closet and were never reported. That privacy victimized women and children and kept them in peril; the legal system often re-victimized them. Both these cases created better awareness and spurred action towards prevention and swift punishment. This is a constructive aspect of celebrity-driven media exposure.When is it appropriate to publicize athletes' private lives? Traditionally there have been different approaches to discipline in parenting. What is seen as abhorrent by some people is considered good parenting by others. Beating a toddler with a tree branch so that he is injured clearly crosses the line. Is it fair to scrutinize the discipline when it falls short of violating a law? Certain athletes have fathered children with multiple mothers. Is this a behavior which should be publicized? There is no question that children parented by single mothers face challenges that others don't. Is it fair to single out those fathers for censure? Or is it nobody's business but the parents?Donald Sterling said abhorrent and harmful things on a tape with his girlfriend. Few would disagree that harboring and expressing those thoughts should disqualify someone from NBA ownership. But are all private conversations fair game for exposure? Should anyone using a phone, or speaking in privacy be subjected to public scrutiny? If there was a method of recording someone's internal thoughts, should they be subject to public scrutiny? Hasn't virtually every person who has been angry or careless expressed themselves in a way that might hurt someone else's feelings, or offend someone if exposed?There is a visceral reaction in this country towards the widespread tracking by the NSA of private phone calls. Fears of ""1984″ thought control and a police state were expressed. Celebrity media draws an audience and profits mightily from the most embarrassing activities and statements of their targets. Controversy sells. An intelligent discussion of which lawful behavior and speech should be considered public, is long overdue."
