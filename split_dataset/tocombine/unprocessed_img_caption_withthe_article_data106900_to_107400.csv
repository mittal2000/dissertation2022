0,RELIGION,The Third Way: A Response to the Southern Baptist Convention,"Danny Cortez, ContributorTeaching pastor at New Heart Community Church",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/southern-baptist-convention_b_6000482.html,"The past few months and years, the church has become increasingly polarized on the LGBT debate. We have neglected to see the importance of what Jesus prayed. Our churches have become dysfunctional and our witness has diminished.",2014-10-21,"Conceptual symbol of multiracial human hands surrounding the Earth globe. Unity, world peace, humanity concept.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f183220000bb01dd32cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""If we become a gay affirming church, I will step down."" These are the words I told my congregation after I disclosed that I had become affirming of same-sex relationships. It seemed like a contradiction. Many people were surprised by my statement since they assumed that this is what I had wanted, but my deeper hope was motivated by Jesus' prayer -- that, even in the midst of our differences, we would be one.The past few months and years, the church has become increasingly polarized on the LGBT debate. We have neglected to see the importance of what Jesus prayed. Our churches have become dysfunctional and our witness has diminished. So at the core of our church's discernment process has been -- how we should live out the high priestly prayer. Jesus believed that unity is the very thing that would cause the advance of his kingdom. It is not only the believing that there is only one Lord, one baptism, and one body of Christ, but it is to live it out in practice. This unity doesn't assume we will agree on all things. But it does assume that those who have come to faith in Christ are part of the ""one faith, one baptism."" And yet, each Sunday our churches are segregated by our theological and verbal disputes. And each Sunday, Christians are excluded from the table because of our disagreements. As I've wrestled with Jesus' high priestly prayer, I can't help but see that the bigger question is -- how do we practice what Jesus prayed? How do we welcome members of the LGBT community even if we are not all in agreement on same-sex marriage?It was because of this question that four months ago, our church decided to adopt the so called Third Way. We wanted a place that affirmed that there is only one body, one Lord and one faith. We wanted a place that acknowledged the deep disagreements and yet the safety to be able to talk intentionally and lovingly through those differences. We wanted to affirm that we had a shared brokenness and the way of discipleship was not to move away from one another, but with one another.Our decision was not well received by Albert Mohler and the Southern Baptist Convention. The response by our denomination was that there is no possibility for a Third Way because Article XV of the Baptist Faith and Message stated, ""In the spirit of Christ, Christians should oppose... all forms of sexual immorality, including adultery, homosexuality and pornography."" As our church was in the dismissal process, I was invited to attend the executive director's yearly meeting in Nashville. I explained to them that the Third Way was possible because the SBC, in regards to Article XV, was already a Third Way denomination. I stated that we all knew pastors who were officiating remarriages in our denomination that were the result of non-permitted divorces. And according to the SBC, this constitutes adultery. Therefore, the act of officiating these remarriages was in direct contradiction to Article XV. And yet, we don't dismiss the churches where these remarriages are taking place. In fact, within the same church, there are some pastors who hold the traditional view and therefore will not officiate these remarriages, and there are some pastors who will. These churches practice a third way where they give space to disagree. We don't draw a line of separation. We know how to extend grace to couples who are in these marriages. We know how not to condemn, even in the midst of disagreement. And my request was that we extend this same grace to LGBT couples. Because to not extend grace is to grant straight privilege. It is to say that in our Baptist practice we will agree to disagree on straight issues but not on LGBT ones.Jesus speaks to the inconsistency of judgment when he taught, ""Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ""Let me take the speck out of your eye,"" when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?"" As the body of Christ, we must practice consistency on how we administer grace.When I met with Dr. Albert Mohler, he expressed that to accept the Third Way would eventually lead to gay affirmation. In a recent article he posted he stated the following in response to our meeting: ""[Danny Cortez] is a gracious and kind man who really seems to believe that there is a third way in this situation -- but who also admits that the third way is not a lasting destination. (emphasis mine)"" I feel as though Dr. Mohler incorrectly stated that I had conceded that the third way is not a lasting destination. In actuality, I agreed that there may indeed be churches who enter into a Third Way dialogue that will land on gay affirmation. That being said, I still maintained that there will be churches that never land at all. I explained that the Third Way wasn't so much a destination but a journey. And that every church will have a different nuance on the conversation. However, the important goal is that we journey together.This is not to say that it will be easy. Since our church became a Third Way congregation, we have had monthly meetings in the backyard of a member's home. And around the fire pit we talk openly about the theological disagreements we have regarding same sex relationships and other matters of controversy. There are evenings where the discussion is hard and emotionally felt. But at the close of the evening, we are able to look across the circle and acknowledge, ""You are family. I am committed to you. I am committed to the body of Christ."" And at the end of the night, there is wonder and amazement, that we have not only survived another day, but that the Spirit of God is teaching us how to love more deeply. There is beauty in giving a safe space to one another to be in process.There are many sins we can point to as an indicator of the demise of our faith. We can look at all manner of sexual sins and violence and greed. But I believe the biggest impediment to fulfilling the great commission is the disunity of the church. Our disunity prevents the world from identifying the body of Christ, from seeing us as Jesus says the world should see us. This disunity is keeping us from coming alongside one another in our shared fallenness and redemption. We can't do discipleship alone. We need each other. But we have embraced segregation as normative. We have allowed our disagreements to separate us. Our fire burns unconvincingly. We minimized the high priestly prayer. And our message is no longer beautiful.Our hope is that the whole body of Christ would see that this debate will not be won through words, but rather a posture of humility, a willingness to admit we may be wrong, and an intentionality toward fellowship. It is the apologetic of love that must be upheld. As Paul says, ""Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace."" After all, ""there is only one Lord, one faith, one baptism."" We belong to one another and our refusal to live out how God sees us dishonors our Lord.So I write this in the spirit of the Third Way -- to acknowledge the disagreement, to clarify our position, but to also embrace the oneness of the body. I admit that I hold differing views with Albert Mohler, and yet I want to state clearly that I affirm his faith and deep desire to know God. I uphold him as a brother. So I pray that every member of the body of Christ would keep from disparaging remarks. And I pray we learn to live as one. Let us move towards celebrating our solidarity through listening, forgiveness, and fellowship.""Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit  through the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit,  just as you were called to one hope when you were called;  one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all,  who is over all and through all and in all."" --The Apostle Paul""I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one  as we are one -- I in them and you in me --  so that they may be brought to complete unity.  Then the world will know that you sent me  and have loved them even as you have loved me."" -- Jesus"

One of my favorites is Mara Grunbaum's WTF Evolution?, which takes a regular look at some of evolution's strangest and most perplexing creations. Now, in plenty of time for Xmas, Gunbaum's evolutionary freak show is a book.In one of Robin Williams' best-known stand-up routines, he says, ""If you look at a platypus, you think that God might get stoned: 'OK, let's take a beaver and put on a duck's bill. It's a mammal, but it lays eggs. Hey, Darwin, kiss my ass!'"" If you get that, chances are you're going to want to take a look at WTF Evolution.In addition to photographs of the creatures in questions, the blog and book feature conversations with Evolution about how and why the animals came to be and WTF Evolution was thinking.In addition to being entertaining, the combined photos and commentary are extremely educational. They are also a constant reminder of what evolution is and how it really works.We tend to think of evolution as a linear process, a straight line that improves the species it acts upon and favors the most efficient improvements. That is not really evolution at all. Evolution is a process of random changes, some of which give the mutated organism an advantage, many of which lead to the animal's death.Over millions and even billions of generations, the accumulated effects of those tiny mutations can lead to strange and bizarre results. The animal in question is, obviously, somewhat successful in its environment, but that does not mean that it is the most efficient possible design.In addition to being educational about life on Earth, WTF Evolution helps with my thinking and imagination about exobiology. Assuming that we someday find life on other planets, that life form is unlikely to look like a human with pointy ears.Life may begin from the same basic building blocks, but life on another planet would have started with its own atmosphere, gravity and environment. From there it would have taken its own random turns, experienced its own challenges and faced its own catastrophes over hundreds of millions of years.So, for a bit of light entertainment combined with science and a reliable jolt to your imagination, check out WTF Evolution on Tumblr and now in paperback."

With a mega following of young girls, I felt a girl power anthem with an emphasis on positive body image for all girls was long overdue... until I listened to the lyrics. Unfortunately, the lyrics give young girls a negative perception of what is expected of them as they grow up with the pressures of today's media driven society. I believe no matter a girls size, self-love is vital to positive self esteem and confidence, however, in the process of lifting curvy girls up these lyrics shame skinny girls with a mantra of so called Girl Power and are shaping girls to believe that pleasing boys comes first. Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two But I can shake it, shake it Like I'm supposed to do 'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase And all the right junk in all the right placesSize does matter, according to the media; however, I love the fact that Meghan is so beautiful and successful and she's not a size two! This is the kind of Girl Power that every girl should see and she wears it so well, but she negates this positive message when she suggests the importance of a girl shaking her body for boys. Any girl, any size has the potential to be successful and have healthy relationships without the use of booty shaking. In my opinion, tips for how to please boys has nothing to do with self-image. One example that comes to mind is Oprah Winfrey... no booty shaking required. Meghan nailed it with the Photoshop and magazine verse. There is a false definition of perfection for young girls. It's time we girls realize our self-worth and know that beauty is not only reflected from the outside. This is a tough mold to break especially since young girls have constant access to the media with the use of advanced technology, and just another reason why I believe celebrities like Meghan should use their power to make positive change. I love that Meghan's Mom told her not to worry about her size. I agree with her! Being healthy is most important. The lyric about what boys want to hold at night communicates to girls that a boy's affection will validate their self-worth. It's so important for women to feel confident in themselves, for themselves. Songs like this also promote the idea that men should regard looks as the most important quality in a girl. I'd love to hear a song about a woman's intelligence, her perseverance, or her sense of humor, anything else besides how she can ""shake it like she's supposed to.""The stick figure Barbie doll lyric is a complete disgrace to girls who are thin. I have been petite and thin my entire life. I am a natural size 1, meaning that I don't diet or exercise to retain my figure. I find it insulting when you insinuate that skinny girls believe they are fat. I have never thought of myself as fat or communicated to anyone that I feel this way and know many girls who share the same thoughts on this subject. Shaming skinny girls while attempting to lift up curvy girls is telling girls that in order to have self-worth they should tear down one another. This is so frustrating to me because women need to stop judging others in order to feel good about themselves. As you bring booty back you are shaming skinny girls with naming calling. I might be skinny but I'm no bitch. I am a 19-year old-girl who spends her time passionately empowering young girls to be confident as they are facing the tough pressures of today's society, and inspiring them to work hard at being THEIR best, not what the media shapes them to believe they should be. Dividing girls into categories such as curvy and skinny is exactly what we don't need, so here's a little re-write with a mantra of my own:I'm bringing confidence back Go ahead and tell all the girls that I'm not playing, I think it's time we stop the shaming But I'm here to tell ya Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top"

Scores of protesters marched chanting ""Bring Back Our Girls"" kidnapped six months ago by Boko Haram. (AP Photo/Olamikan Gbemiga)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13f2d240000330076ec89.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nigeria says it has struck a cease-fire deal with Boko Haram, raising hopes that over 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped by the militant group will be released. But mystery continues to surround the identity of the interlocutor on the other side of the negotiations. Nigerian officials said the deal was reached in Chad on Friday in talks with a Saudi Arabia-based Boko Haram representative named Danladi Ahmadu. The name took many by surprise, including people who have been involved in previous negotiations with Boko Haram. “I have failed to find anyone who has ever heard of him,” BBC’s Nigeria correspondent wrote. “We've tried verifying the authenticity of the person from sources traditionally close to Boko Haram militants and we are getting negative feedback,” the editors of Nigerian news site Sahara Reporters told The WorldPost by email. Ahmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist who is considered close to Boko Haram's leaders, said he does not believe Ahmadu is part of the group’s leadership or that he speaks for the group. “I challenge Danladi Ahmadu to an open debate if he has d [sic] interest of Nigeria at heart. Who is he?"" Salkida wrote on Twitter.But Mike Omeri, the Nigerian government's spokesperson on the Boko Haram insurgency, told The WorldPost Saturday that the government is confident it has been negotiating with the right guy.“These talks did not just happen one sunny morning ... They approached the president of Chad, and if he wasn’t confident [of Ahmadu’s identity] he wouldn’t have connected him with the president of Nigeria,” Omeri said. ""The fact that this contact comes from Nigeria’s neighbor gives us confidence.""Chad has confirmed it is acting as a mediator in the talks to free the girls, who were kidnapped in the Nigerian village of Chibok in April. Since Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan visited Chad last month, rumors have grown that Nigeria's government was quietly negotiating the girls' release via its neighbor. It was not immediately clear how long the talks have been taking place.Boko Haram's leadership has not commented on the cease-fire. Meanwhile, Ahmadu himself has purportedly made at least two statements in recent days. On Friday, he gave an interview with Voice of America’s Hausa-language service in which he didn’t mention the kidnapped schoolgirls and was vague on the details of the cease-fire, Agence France-Presse reported. The news agency also noted that Ahmadu referred to the militant group as Boko Haram, a name used by outsiders but not by the insurgents themselves.On Saturday, Sahara Reporters said its correspondent in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri had obtained a CD recording of another statement by Ahamdu. This time, he was more precise. “On the girls that we took from Chibok, all that we want before we free the girls is to get justice from the Nigerian state because there are many of our members that their business premises were destroyed, some killed and others in detention and many other oppression,” Ahmadu said, according to a translation from Hausa by Sahara Reporters. The news site’s editors said they remain skeptical about his identity.As part of the deal, Omeri said, the talks taking place in Chad this week will address the release of the schoolgirls.Omeri added that the militants are motivated by a wish to reintegrate into society. “They are working towards peace in order to have a chance for them to return to normal things -- for example, many have businesses, "" he said.Asked whether Nigeria would consider releasing captured Boko Haram militants in exchange for the girls, Omeri said “every asset"" will be directed towards the girls' release. ""Everything possible is being done until the day they are freed,"" he said.""Boko Haram want peace, they are ready for it and intend to have it implemented,"" he added.After the cease-fire was announced, suspected Boko Haram militants continued to attack communities in northeast Nigeria, leaving several dozen dead over the weekend.But Omeri insisted that the violence would not deter the negotiations. He suggested that militants in remote areas may not have heard about the cease-fire, or that the attacks could have been perpetrated by criminal opportunists, rather than Boko Haram members.Boko Haram is ""deeply fractured,"" according to the risk consultancy Stratfor, quoted in Reuters Sunday. Nigeria's government had a ""difficult time identifying a Boko Haram representative who could make compromises and guarantee the entire group will observe them,"" Stratfor said.""It is quite possible that Abuja has reached an agreement with a legitimate representative of a specific cell ... that holds the kidnapped schoolgirls captive,"" the group added.In the kidnapped girls’ hometown, the community hardly dared to hope that the girls might be finally returned. ""We don't know how true it is until we prove it,"" said Bana Lawan, chairman of Chibok Local Government Area, told The Associated Press."

This is Selig's last World Series. Perhaps nothing demonstrates how baseball has turned off young sports fans than how young sports fans have turned off the World Series.,2014-10-21,"Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig is seen during the Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony on Sunday, July 28, 2013, in Cooperstown, N.Y. (AP Photo/Mike Groll)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb771602400003100570564.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Several years ago, Joey Boyd of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, wanted to introduce his 4-year-old son, Will, to the game of baseball by signing him up with a membership to the New York Yankees' kids' fan club. Boyd balked when he saw the team charged $26. Boyd began checking other teams' websites and found nearly all Major League teams charged kids to join their fan clubs. Boyd wrote Baseball commissioner A.H. ""Bud"" Selig to appeal to owners to not charge kids. It would be a loss leader for the teams, Boyd explained, because it would draw countless kids to the sport of baseball. Selig responded by saying, ""I will certainly discuss this matter with the clubs at Major League meetings."" Selig included an autographed baseball for Will. Nothing changed. Most teams continued to charge kids to join their fan clubs.This anecdote represents Selig's 22-year run as baseball commissioner, which ends in January. Baseball isn't about kids or even adults to Selig. It's not about fathers playing catch with sons, keeping score, cheering for your favorite player, or, in the case of my own son, hoping to get a foul ball or a player's autograph.To Selig, the only autograph a kid needs is Selig's. And to Selig and baseball owners, the only autograph worth having is the treasury secretary's signature on U.S. currency.Major League Baseball has made billions of dollars in television revenues during the Selig years.But what does it profit a sport to gain so much money but lose its future? An ESPN study concluded that the NFL remains the most popular league among 12- to 17-year-olds in the United States, with 38.9 percent of respondents naming it their favorite. The NBA was next at 30.1 percent, surpassing NCAA football at 27.5 percent. Next were college basketball at 23.8 percent, the MLB and Major League Soccer at 18.0 percent, and the National Hockey League at 8.9 percent.Selig's legacy may be that he lost the next generation of baseball fans. This is Selig's last World Series. Perhaps nothing demonstrates how baseball has turned off young sports fans than how young sports fans have turned off the World Series.  Television ratings were up for last year's World Series. And so was the age of the viewers who watched it. The average age of those who watched the series was nearly 54, which is believed to be the oldest in history. On the other hand, only 4.1 percent of children between the ages of 6-17 watched the series, the Nielsen media research firm reported.Selig, team owners, and the networks start most postseason games at 8:30 p.m. EST or later to generate primetime advertising dollars. By the time the game gets into the third inning, most kids -- or at least those who are still vaguely interested in baseball -- have gone to bed. The World Series is baseball's biggest stage and yet the lights are out. If a baseball game is played at midnight and no one sees it, does it make a difference?Children, who care less and less about baseball, grow up to be adults, who care little or nothing about baseball. Unlike Selig and baseball, the NFL and the NBA understand that if you get the attention of fans when they're young, they can be yours for life. Football and basketball are better suited to younger fans. They're faster, more physical and play better on television. But the NFL and NBA also market their games to kids.Selig sends out an autographed baseball and goes back to counting his money. Will Boyd is now 12. He cares nothing about baseball."

Woody Allen humorously addressed this era of the 20's in Midnight in Paris. Today that Lost Generation has multiplied and their great great great grandchildren--in other words, Americans, are everywhere. Having propagated almost biblically, the descendants of the Lost Generation have become like a plague of locusts. You can't go anywhere in Paris without seeing Americans and just when you think you've located a bona fide Frenchman, who talks the talk and walks the walk, even he or she can turn out to be an American dressed up as Frenchmen. You learn not be fooled by Francophiles in berets, who can rattle off esoteric Metro stops like Michel-Ange-Molitor and have no trouble cherching for the rue du Cherche-Midi. Though the onslaught of Americans is welcomed for the economic bounty they represent, they're looked at suspiciously and even disdainfully by many Parisians precisely because even those with affectations fundamentally lack the Gallic charm, the holy grail that many Americans come to Paris for in the first place. When a Frenchman comes to New York, he or she is generally treated like royally due to the way they embody what is deemed to be a superior culture. But the achievements of the Lost Generation of Hemingways and Fitzageralds have long been forgotten and it's the image of the ugly American with his or her profound lack of savoir faire--the tourist loaded down with guide books, time sensitive tickets to the latest blockbuster art show at the Grand Palais and naturally their Zagat's--that's prevailed. In a sense it's unfair. Why should enthusiastic Americans be penalized while the French are rewarded for being what they are?{This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"

These women were participating in a panel jointly hosted by the National Women's Hall of Fame and the Florida Commission on the Status of Women. In this blog, we'll learn about women who have been inducted into both the Florida Women's Hall of Fame and the National Women's Hall of Fame -- whose accomplishments have benefited women and life in the Sunshine State. Match the following with her achievement: (answers at the end): ____ 1. The first female attorney general of the United States.  ____ 2. A pilot who commanded the Women Air Force Service Pilots (WASPs) during World War II  ____ 3. The biochemist who developed the skin test that identifies tuberculosis. ____ 4. Today, she is recognized as one of the 20th century's greatest writers on the African-American experience. A. Jacqueline Cochran B. Zora Neale Hurston C. Janet Reno D. Florence SeibertThe first African-American student to attend New York's Barnard College, Zora Neale Hurston's  education in anthropology informed her films, plays and writings. Raised in the nation's first incorporated all-black township of Eatonville, Florida, Hurston studied at Howard University in Washington, DC before she went to Barnard (graduating in 1928). Over her career, she wrote numerous short stories, plays, essays, an autobiography Dust Tracks on the Road, four novels and two books of folklore. Although well-known during her lifetime (she received a number of literary and other awards), Alice Walker worked to restore knowledge of Hurston's accomplishments and writings in the 1970s. Today, Hurston is regarded as one of the 20th century's greatest writers on the African-American experience. Florence Seibert developed the skin test that identifies tuberculosis. A biochemist who survived polio as a child, Seibert had worked as a graduate student to purify distilled water and eliminate bacterial contaminants. In 1934, Seibert published the results of the work in which she had purified the protein used for the tuberculosis test. The protein was called Purified Protein Derivative (PPD). By 1940, she had improved the protein purification process to the point that it became the international standard for the tuberculosis tests and is still used today. After she moved to Florida, Seibert became director of a cancer research laboratory. She received many prizes and recognition for her work. Born near DeFuniak Springs, Florida (date unknown), Jacqueline Cochran was raised in poverty and didn't have a pair of shoes until she was 9 years old. Her first job was sweeping floors and serving as a shampoo girl at a beauty salon; although her desire was to fly airplanes. In 1932, she earned her pilot's license and in 1934, she entered her first airplane race. By 1937, she had earned the first of the 15 trophies she would be awarded as the outstanding woman aviator in the world. Prior to World War II, Cochran had suggested to the President and his advisors that women could serve as pilots as needed. Although her idea was originally rejected, by 1942, her plans for women pilots serving their country were embraced. Cochran was asked to train and organize women pilots into what became the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs), which she then commanded. The WASPs, over 1,000 strong, flew over 60 million miles in every type of aircraft during the War. In 2009, President Obama signed the legislation awarding the WASPs the Congressional Gold Medal. Janet Reno, the first female attorney general in the U.S., had a career filled with firsts. Born in Miami, Florida, Reno attended Cornell University and Harvard Law School. Elected as the first female Dade County State Attorney in 1978, she became the U.S. attorney general in 1993 during President Bill Clinton's administration. Her focuses as attorney general included reducing crime and violence, intervention to keep children from high risk and dangerous behaviors, and enforcing civil rights.

7,ENTERTAINMENT,5 Things You Didn't Know About Kim Kardashian,Stephanie Marcus,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-facts_n_6015662.html,,2014-10-21,"LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - SEPTEMBER 03: Kim Kardashian pictured at BBC Radio 1 on September 3, 2014 in London, England.

She's followed round-the-clock by a camera crew when she films her reality show, and has taken so many selfies in her lifetime that she released them in a coffee table book this past May. Alas, even with all her sharing there might be a few things about Kardashian you were somehow unaware of, and in honor of the star's 35th birthday we've rounded up a few facts about her that may just boggle your mind: Kardashian attended Marymount High School, an all-girls Catholic school in Los Angeles, where her classmates apparently knew she had a type.  In 2007, Kardashian formed a company called Kimsaprincess, Inc., which tells you exactly what the reality star thinks of herself. It's also the name of her eBay store and her Myspace name. Even someone as pampered as Kim Kardashian doesn't have time for a daily blowout. In fact, the reality star keeps a four-day schedule of changing styles to make sure her brunette tresses are at their healthiest. ""I start out the first day with a clean blowout,"" Kardashian recently told Us Weekly. ""The second day, I put in dry shampoo, which adds texture. Then, the third day, I sleek it and I straighten it, and then, the fourth day, I put our oil in it, and I make it a really sleek look. I might do a ponytail or a sleek bun. That’s my hair plan, and then I start over.""“It’s definitely a memory and it was a fun experience. We gave the proceeds to a cancer organization,"" Kardashian recently told ""Watch What Happens Live"" host Andy Cohen of her 2011 song ""Jam (Turn It Up)."" ""But if there’s one thing in life that I wish I didn’t do ... I don’t like it when people kind of dabble into things they shouldn’t be. And that I don’t think I should have. Like, what gave me the right to think I could be a singer? Like, I don’t have a good voice.”It's no secret that West has been in love with Kardashian for forever, but the reality star revealed to her friends and family during her bachelorette party that the first time she spoke to the rapper, he called her and they talked on the phone for eight hours. Though they had an obvious ""connection,"" Kardashian had a boyfriend at the time, and it would be years before they would get together and West would be able to call Kim his ""Perfect Bitch,"" ""number one trophy wife,"" or tell her: ""You will never need another lover / Cause you a MILF and I'm a motherfucker."" Note: This post was originally published in 2014 and updated since the reality star is one year older."
8,IMPACT,A Gamechanger: Nobel Prize Winner Kailash Satyarthi,"Laura N.

That was how I learned that these two trailblazers were being given one of the highest honors imaginable, the Nobel Peace Prize, ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education."" In making the award, the Nobel Prize committee said they ""regarded it as an important point for a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism."" The two activists were born nearly a half century apart with different religions and to different countries, yet their work goes hand in hand since child laborers need to have someone also championing their right to equitable, quality education. If Yousafzai wasn't already a household name before winning the Nobel Peace Prize, she is now. The media attention has been near constant since the Taliban shot her in the head two years ago for advocating for the rights of girls to access education in Pakistan. Most people wouldn't have been able to overcome such an attack, yet it made Yousafzai all the more of a tireless education activist and leader.But who is Satyarthi? Education advocates like myself know him and his incredible work well, and understand just how much he has earned this honor. His BackgroundKailash Satyarthi was born to a middle class family in Madhya Pradesh, India in 1954. He studied electrical engineering in college, and then received a post-graduate diploma in high voltage engineering -- a degree that seems fitting for someone whose work is grounded in unwavering energy, bravery, faith, and perseverance against great odds.After a brief career as a professor, Satyarthi decided to follow his life's passion and devote his time and energy to combating child labor and child slavery. It's No Small MissionAccording to the International Labor Organization, an estimated 21 million children are forced into labor around the world, which means there are more slaves now than ever before in history. The ILO also asserts that some ""168 million child laborers are in need of immediate and urgent help."" While child labor is not the same as child slavery, it can have a devastating impact on children's education, development, and future earnings. UNICEF stresses that while child labor infringes ""on the rights of all children -- boys and girls alike -- girls often start working at an earlier age than boys, especially in rural areas where most working children are found."" Satyarthi and his friends founded Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA, which translates to Save Childhood Movement) in 1980, and over the last 34 years they've been involved in the rescue of more than 70,000 bonded child laborers.That's roughly the number of children you'd expect to find in 156 average-sized elementary schools in the U.S. It's also around the same number of children enrolled in Montgomery County, Maryland's more than 140 public elementary schools. This one organization has freed that many children from bonded labor. And BBA has even launched a successful model for educating and rehabilitating children who have been freed, so that they might have brighter futures.His Reach Satyarthi is something of a modern-day Mahatma Gandhi. Ghandi's quote ""Be the change you want to see in the world"" is very much a call to action for Satyarthi. Satyarthi has followed Gandhi's example of social activism, leading hundreds of peaceful protests and marches focused on ending the exploitation of children for financial profit. In 1998, he organized the Global March Against Child Labor across 103 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the U.S., with the participation of over 7.2 million people and 20,000 civil society organizations. The march was highly successful, and the next year the international convention on the worst forms of child labor (ILO Convention 182) was revised. Satyarthi is also a driving force behind End Child Slavery Week, which will take place from November 20-26, 2014. Participants in this global week of action will call on the United Nations to incorporate the abolition of child slavery into the next round of UN global goals (called the post-2015 development agenda), and could make a tremendous difference for millions of children around the world. In global development efforts, what gets measured gets attention. Satyarthi knows how critically important it is that efforts to abolish child slavery be measured through the next round of the UN's global goals, which will be launched in January 2016.His HumilityThe sheer numbers that Satyarthi is able to mobilize around one of the world's greatest, but least-known, ills is nothing short of astounding.Satyarthi's achievements have a personal dimension for me. I first met Satyarthi back in 1999 after he'd organized the Global March. I remember thinking then that I was talking with an amazingly powerful and inspirational activist, who would truly change the world. I didn't know at the time (or when I met with him three weeks ago at a UN General Assembly side meeting) that Satyarthi would receive a Nobel Peace Prize for his transformative work, but I did know that he was an incredible leader and change agent. I've always thought that the most powerful and admirable leaders also have a strong sense of humility. It seems to me that he has humility in spades. His Legacy I'm grateful that this Nobel Peace Prize will raise awareness about the often forgotten connection between child labor, child slavery, and access to equitable education for all, including the most marginalized children. The work Satyarthi does, often alongside education and learning advocates around the world like myself, has the ability to go even further than eliminating child labor and slavery. It can help lift entire communities and nations out of poverty and help put them on a path toward universal access to quality education for all."

Ferguson has been struggling to heal since riots erupted following the August 9, killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer in suburban Ferguson. Another teenager, Vonderrit Myers Jr., was killed by a St. Louis police officer on October 8. Several demonstrators and members of the clergy were arrested at the protest after a show of civil disobedience.

As a white, middle-aged, married, mother of three and a rule-abiding Presbyterian, this was a new experience for me. We marched in the street, sang in the rain, shivered in the police van, and danced in the jail cell. There were many unpleasant parts of this experience, including physical discomfort (cold, hunger, thirst, no access to restrooms, confinement in very small spaces) and psychological discomfort (lack of control, lack of information and communication, very thorough pat downs, unpredictable behavior from police officers). Yet one of the hardest parts was figuring out how to explain where I had been to my five year-old child in terms she could understand. I went with this: ""When you know you are loved, you can say when you are sorry.""Repentance was the theological center of Monday's clergy action. Repentance involves two elements: confessing sin and a willingness to do differently, to amend our ways. What makes repentance possible is faith in the love of God. When we know that we are loved by God, we can admit the ways in which we have fallen short of who we are called to be. Repentance over racism is very tricky, because our public language about racism gets easily sidetracked into questions about the intentions or beliefs of individuals (this person is or is not racist). But racism is systemic. It indicates the ways in which our social structures make life easier for white people and harder for black and brown people. Every person living in America participates in this system in some way or another -- to their benefit, their harm, or both. I often uphold structural racism in small ways that do not spring from mean intentions or hateful beliefs, but rather from ignorance or inattention, because I am focused on my own comforts or crises.Monday morning began at Wellspring United Methodist Church, with a brief training in civil disobedience, with prayer and with repentance. There were famous leaders there, including Cornel West. There were many faith leaders from around the country, including rabbis, imams, priests, pastors, and avowed religious persons. There were incredible local faith leaders from St. Louis who are doing amazing work, such as Rabbi Susan Talve, Rev. Traci Blackmon, Rev. Rebecca Ragland. And there were national faith-based organizing leaders, such as Rev. Nelson Pierce and Rev. Alvin Herring. But all of these people acknowledge that the true leaders of this movement are the young people of Ferguson, black millenials who have been out in the streets protesting day after day and night after night. These are the people who have borne the brunt of systemic racism and militarized policing. These are the people who have arisen as the leaders of a movement for equality and justice that has wide implications and global reach. One of the first moments of our time together that morning was to admit that we, as people of faith in this country, have failed these young people. We have not worked hard enough to dismantle racism in the United States. We have not fought hard enough against media representations of them as thugs and criminals. We failed the young people of Ferguson, and young black people across the country, long before Michael Brown was gunned down in the street. And so we repented. We could do this because all of us, in different ways, affirm that we are held in a larger context of love.Working within the Reformed traditions in Christianity, I think of it this way. Because we know that God loves us, we can admit that we screw up. Because God says that I am ok, I can admit that I am a hot mess. It is the love of God -- abundant and capacious, with room for all -- that gives me the confidence to confess my sins. Then we followed the lead of the protesters of Ferguson and took to the streets. We had repented; We called others to repent. After prayer and song, litany and testimony, clergy members stood directly in front of the police officers present, addressed them by name, and said, ""You are part of an unjust and racist system that is responsible for the death of Mike Brown. I call for your repentance, and I offer to hear your confession.""The police officers had varying (and in some cases wildly divergent) responses to our words. Some refused to make eye contact. Others engaged in heartfelt conversations. I was astonished and humbled by the context of love. A woman next to me testified of God's enveloping love. Clergy to my right spoke with such tenderness about the availability of grace.We later crossed the police line, knowing we would be arrested. Many chanted, ""We love you,"" as we crossed the line. The police officers I encountered from the time of my arrest to my release (a seven hour ordeal) had diverse attitudes. One clearly felt betrayed by the clergy, as his family has received numerous threats in the past two months. One thanked us for coming. Some treated us with hostility, and some treated us with respect and kindness. One had us stand, handcuffed, with our backs to the wall, while he ranted that we should be protesting President Obama. As prisoners, we were exposed to the discretionary power of these officers with few avenues of response. After two hours of training and worship, four hours and thirty-two minutes of protest, and seven hours as a prisoner in Ferguson, I was released to cheers and warm embraces from other protesters. After the exhausting and dehumanizing ordeal, it was overwhelming to feel such welcome and community. I often hear white people respond to discussions of racism by saying ""I am not racist""; ""I didn't mean it that way""; or ""not all white people are racist."" These remarks miss the point that racism is systemic and institutionalized. It is not about individual beliefs or intentions. They also miss a larger theological point. God loves us, so we can admit we are wrong and try to do better. Every week in church we practice repentance. There are various liturgies, but they basically say, ""Because you love us, God, we can tell you we screwed up again. We are sorry. Help us as we work hard to do better."" It is a good thing we practice because the work of repentance is ongoing. I have been posting on Facebook about my experience in Ferguson, and in one comment I referred to the police van as a ""paddy wagon."" A friend who is an activist and teacher, Chris Doucot, explained to me that this term has its origins as a slur against Irish people, who were once upon a time racialized as a reviled ethnic group in the U.S. Oh shit. In the midst of my attempts to dismantle racism, I did it again. Thank you for telling me. I am so sorry. I have the freedom to do this -- to repent -- because I stand in the context of God's love."
