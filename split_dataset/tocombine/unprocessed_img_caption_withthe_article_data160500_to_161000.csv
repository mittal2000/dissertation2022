0,PARENTING,Why Kids Lie,"Dr. Peggy Drexler, Contributor
Author, research psychologist and gender scholar",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-kids-lie_us_5b9cf0b9e4b03a1dcc831ba5,"It's important to raise children to value honesty, and to prevent lying from becoming frequent and consistent, the point at which lying is most troublesome. The first step in figuring out how to address a lie is to consider why your child is telling it. Is the child trying to avoid trouble? Save face?",2013-03-16,Young girl with long brown hair laying on the floor while looking up. Isolated on white. Much copy space.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf0b92200008300d96f6c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Eight-year-old Henry lied about everything. It absolutely infuriated his mother, Sophie, if mostly because she couldn't figure out why he was doing it. Some of the lies she understood, as they'd clearly been issued to avoid mild trouble or reprimand, like the lies about whether he'd made his bed or eaten his lunch. But he'd also tell very obvious lies from which he had nothing to gain, like that it was sunny outside when it wasn't, or that 2 plus 2 was 5. What bothered Sophie most about the lies was how adamantly Henry would insist they weren't lies, even as Sophie pointed out the rain pouring down outside. ""It's not like I'd have preferred if he was a good liar,"" Sophie told me, ""but it was confusing that he chose to lie about things he a) didn't need to lie about and b) that were so easy to call him out on. I'd be like, you're eight. You know that 2 plus 2 is 4. You can see it's raining outside. You can't even defend these lies a little bit. Why are you telling them?"" It's entirely normal for kids to experiment with lying, starting at an early age -- sometimes as early as two -- and escalating until 12, the age of greatest deceit, according to various studies conducted by Canadian researcher Kang Lee. Some lying is ""healthy"" lying -- fantasy and imagination at work, like a four-year-old's lie about her teddy bear telling her a secret. Other lies are ""white lies"" told to benefit another or to avoid hurting someone's feelings, and which tend to start around age six. Most lies kids -- and, for that matter, adults -- tell are more self-serving, however, and told to avoid trouble or punishment, look better in the eyes of others, or get (or get away with) something. This sort of lie from a three-year-old might come out as ""someone else"" spilling the apple juice on the living room rug. A 10-year-old who's insecure about his math abilities might lie about having already done his math homework. This sort of lie can also show up, especially in boys, as mischief making. Seven-year-old Bobby always wanted to know ""what would happen"" if he threw a tennis ball against the house. He waited until his parents were out to tell the babysitter that ""Mom lets me do it."" He was so insistent, and confident, that the babysitter acquiesced. Later that day, Bobby's mom, Kathy, returned home to find the garage door window shattered in pieces on the driveway. ""I suppose now he knew what would happen if you throw a ball against the house,"" said Kathy. ""But then again, he probably always knew."" What Bobby had done was use lying to get what he wanted, while also, in his mind, having the ability to ""blame"" the babysitter for allowing him to do it. And then there are those kids who tell lies just for kicks, seemingly without anything to gain. In the case of Henry, for instance, insisting that 2 plus 2 was 5 was something he said just because he could; just, Sophie suspected, to see what might happen. Some studies suggest that children with better cognitive abilities tend to lie more, since lying requires first keeping the truth in mind and then manipulating that information. The ability to lie successfully -- something that Henry had not yet learned how to do, though Sophie got the sense he was definitely working his way up to that -- requires even more in the way of thinking and reasoning. Lying proficiency has also been linked to good social skills later on, in adolescence. That doesn't mean such lies, or any lies kids tell, should go unacknowledged. It's important to raise children to value honesty, and to prevent lying from becoming frequent and consistent, the point at which lying is most troublesome. The first step in figuring out how to address a lie is to consider why your child is telling it. Is the child trying to avoid trouble? Save face? Is he old enough to understand that lying is wrong? A three-year-old who won't cop to coloring on the wall knows that wall coloring is bad, but may not quite understand that lying about it isn't. In such a case, instead of threatening him with punishment, teach him about the value of things. Gently point out that you think he may know more than he is letting on, and then thank and praise him if he comes clean. This can foster more truth-telling in the future. What's more, in younger and older kids, don't set them up to lie. If you know a child has spilled milk on the living room rug because you saw it happen, don't ask her if she spilled milk on the rug. Instead, ask her why it happened. If you know your 16-year-old has been smoking because you found cigarettes in his car, don't ask him if he's smoking. Ask him when he started. In all cases, when talking to kids about lying, express your displeasure. Be explicit that it's wrong to lie, and explain why. Make it clear that lying diminishes trust, and that the more frequently he lies, the harder it becomes to believe him when he's telling the truth. Establish, and stick with, consequences for lying; the more a child has gotten away with lying, the more likely he is to continue. Try to head lying off at the pass: If you sense a lie is coming, say, ""It makes me happy when you tell me the truth."" And keep in mind yourself that lying is different from not sharing. This is particularly relevant as kids approach adolescence, when kids may be more reluctant to share information with you, but without necessarily lying. Allowing them to develop their own sense of independence -- that is, resisting the need to know everything -- and being confident in their decision-making will reduce the likelihood that they'll lie to you about the things that really matter. And above all, with kids of any age, help encourage the notion of truth telling by practicing it yourself. Most adults issue ""harmless"" lies all day long, within earshot of children. Maybe that's a lie about a kid's age to get a break on tickets to a soccer game. Or telling someone who calls that you can't talk because you're running out the door, when you're about to sit down to watch a movie. Keep in mind that kids, especially those under 10, often can't tell the difference between small lies and big ones. They just know it's happening. And that lying is a learned -- but changeable -- behavior. The more they're conditioned to hearing lies, the more they'll think they're a normal part of behavior, and vice versa. Which means the biggest truth of all is that raising honest kids starts with you."

When deciding whether to pony up the cash for your favorite vending machine snack or if you should sneak away to that tray of leftover pastries in the break room, ask yourself one question: Am I really hungry? Many times our bodies can fool us into thinking we are hungry when actually we are just bored, tired, stressed or even thirsty. There are two types of people: snackers and non-snackers. Some people can eat three meals a day and be completely satisfied. Many others, however, need that snack to hold them over to the next meal. If you are one of the many out there that need a snack to curb hunger, why not boost your metabolism while enjoying that healthy snack?The Morning Snacker  If you start to feel that craving hit before lunch, a perfect way to fight off that hunger is with something simple. A cup of hot or iced green tea is the perfect option. Not only is it very low in calories, but studies have shown green tea contains a substance called EGCG, which is a powerful antioxidant with calorie-burning properties. If green tea seems a bit too bland, try a packet of E-boost. It not only contains green tea, but with flavors like orange, pink lemonade and pomegranate it will also leave you satisfied and energized until lunch.The Mid-Day Snacker  Many times our day can be unpredictable. It can start on track with a healthy lunch around noon, then work and errands take over and you may not be sitting down for your next meal until seven hours later. If the gap between lunch and dinner is a long one, a light snack may be just what you need. With so many options out there it is easy to consume unnecessary calories during a snack break. So instead, look for a snack that can work double-duty by curbing your hunger and boosting your metabolism. Go for something spicy! Research has shown that spicy foods containing red pepper can heat up your body and boost your metabolism. A low-calorie, portion controlled snack like Oloves Hot Chili Mama olives is a perfect option. I love this spicy option because you can throw a pack in your bag, and with only 50 calories, it is a guilt-free snack. Not into olives? Try sprinkling Hail Merry Chimayo Chile Pecans over Greek yogurt for a creamy, spicy snack.The Light-Dinner Snacker  Sometimes a light dinner, like salad, can have you rummaging through the refrigerator later in the night. if you are looking for a simple dinner and are not feeling content with just a salad, quinoa is great option that has been shown to boost your metabolism and burn fat. Try enjoying a salad with a side serving of quinoa soup like Nature's Earthly Choice- Easy Quinoa Lentil Soup. Quinoa is packed with protein and fiber, which are both champions at fighting off hunger and burning fat.The Late-Night Snacker  Like many of us, you have finished dinner but don't feel quite satisfied until you have had a tasty treat to end your night. Many studies have presented cinnamon as a metabolism booster. Lucky for us, cinnamon usually comes baked into something sweet. I love to pop a Nature's Bakery Apple Cinnamon fig bar in the microwave for a few seconds and top with frozen berries. Another bonus: Figs are packed with antioxidants and can help you feel fuller, longer.For more by Heather Bauer, RD, CDN, click here.For more on diet and nutrition, click here."

And others don't see it until they hear those terrifying words: ""I want a divorce.""",2013-03-16,Upset pair of lovers lying on the bed. Family conflict.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cedee3c00005b0009f3ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Written by Adriana Velez on CafeMom's blog, The Stir.Some of us see divorce coming from a long way off. And others don't see it until they hear those terrifying words: ""I want a divorce."" Especially for women who don't see it coming, that separation can send you into an emotional tailspin. And your turmoil can propel you to make some horrible mistakes that can cause an awful lot of trouble later on.We talked with divorce attorney Randall Kessler of Kessler and Solomiani in Atlanta about the most important things moms need to know about divorce, especially when it's an acrimonious split. Here's what not to do -- and why, even if your husband has left you with nothing, you should still hold onto hope.1. Don't panic. ""Knowledge is power,"" Kessler says. So don't freak out -- get educated. Go online and find out everything you need to know (his firm's website has a list of helpful resources, and every state has divorce information online). Meet with a lawyer -- or better yet, more than one lawyer. Find out what your rights are, because you do have rights. And know that you're not going to get kicked out of your home immediately just because your husband isn't paying your rent or mortgage anymore. Explain your situation to everyone as soon as possible, and don't get intimidated into agreeing to a settlement before you're ready to.2. Don't just get a free consultation if you can avoid it. Kessler says you'll get better legal advice if you pay for it. There are exceptions, and a free consultation is better than nothing. How do you pay for that consultation? That leads to the next don't.3. Don't borrow money from family -- yet. I was surprised when Kessler recommended against borrowing money from family for a lawyer. But he says you should save those resources for another time. Instead, see if you can borrow against your home or get a credit card. If you are financially dependent on your husband, he is responsible for paying for at least part of your representation. But you're less likely to get that money back if you've borrowed it from your family.4. Don't allow your ex to intimidate you. ""When your husband tells you that your lawyer just wants to make money, that's an intimidation tactic,"" Kessler says. Your husband may know how to scare you, but he doesn't know how to scare your lawyer. If you're in an acrimonious split, let your lawyer talk with his lawyer.5. Don't run into the arms of another man. Or as Kessler puts it, ""Don't commit adultery."" Even if your husband has been carrying on an affair, starting one of your own will only add emotional heat to your divorce. Kessler says he's seen it too many times -- wives feel lonely, but husbands get angry, and then they make everything difficult. Don't give your husband any ammunition. Wait until you have a settlement to start your new romantic life. No, it's not fair. But it's practical.6. Don't demand money before you've made up a budget. Kessler says it's important that you create a budget, even if you've never had one before. ""You need a well-organized, detailed budget. It's your backup for why you need the alimony and child support you're asking for. You need to make sure all your needs are addressed.""And now, the hopeful part: ""There are silver linings in divorce and I think you need to find them,"" Kessler says. Everyone who gets divorced feels terrified. Every woman is afraid she'll be a bag lady. But you get through it. Eventually, ""you'll realize the benefits of not living with someone who isn't happy living with you."" Kessler's book, Divorce, Protect Yourself, Your Kids and Your Future, comes out in fall 2013.What's the first thing you would do if your husband suddenly demanded a divorce -- or if you suddenly realized you should demand one?More from The Stir:7 Things You Should Consider Before Getting Back Together With Your Ex10 Things Every Woman Going Through a Divorce Wants to Hear Here's How Much a Divorce REALLY Costs What NOT to Say to Your Spouse If You Want to Stay Married (VIDEO) "

Here are seven signs that you have moved on. You don't talk about your ex anymore: During the split, you probably spoke about your ex a lot with friends and family. When you don't talk about your ex anymore, it is a good sign that he or she is behind you. You don't mind seeing your ex with someone new: When you see your ex with a new love interest and it doesn't bother you, then you have clearly gotten over him or her. They're now somebody else's problem. You share holidays: If you and your ex have children, you may end up spending some holidays together. You know you're over the relationship when your ex asks you to pass the gravy on Thanksgiving and you don't feel like throwing it on him or her. You don't seek them out: We have all Googled an ex after a breakup. But when you stop putting his or her name into the search box and don't really care to know what he or she is doing, you have made it through. You want to be friends again: When you broke up, you probably de-friended your ex on Facebook. If you have kids together, you may want to friend them again. This is not because you're stalking your ex or want to know everything about him or her; it's actually just because you want to be friends.You forget to return your ex's calls: When your ex calls you about something and you truly forget to return his or her phone call, you have definitely moved on.

Of those foreign citizens surveyed by Gallup in 130 countries, 25% disapproved of the job performance of President Obama’s administration.Click here to see the 10 countries that hate America most While citizens around the world are more inclined to think highly of our leadership than not, there are some parts of the world where residents generally have a poor impression of the United States. In seven nations, more than 60% of those surveyed disapproved of the current administration. In Pakistan, that number was nearly 80%. Based on the recent survey, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 countries that hate America the most.Not surprisingly, most of the countries that appear on this list are located in the Middle East, where the United States has long struggled to maintain positive diplomatic relations. Among the leading factors that have complicated our image in the region is the “war on terror,” which includes the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and our penetration of Pakistani airspace to assassinate Osama bin Laden. All three of these nations had among the highest levels of disapproval of U.S. leadership.Our relatively strong diplomatic relationship with Israel has also resulted in strained relationships between the U.S. and these countries. The Palestinian territories, neighboring Lebanon, and Iran, disapprove of U.S.’s foreign policy. Each of these continue to have volatile relationships with Israel as well.However, not every country that disapproves of U.S. policies is in the Middle East. One that stands out is Greece, where approval has fallen dramatically over the past five years, coinciding with the country’s economic tailspin.In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., deputy director of Gallup’s world poll, Jon Clifton, explained why Greece’s negative perception of the United States might be so bad. According to Clifton, the country had one the worst levels of negative emotions overall. “It makes you wonder if that creeps into their views of overall global leadership,” Clifton said, “because things are so tough in Greece right now.”This trend is not confined to Greece. All of the countries with the highest disapproval of the U.S. government suffer from poor economic conditions. Most have high levels of poverty and, according to a review of Gallup polls, they also have among the worst levels of economic and social well-being in the world. They have high levels of political instability and, in many cases, high levels of terrorism as well.It is the poor economic and social conditions in these countries themselves that may contribute to the low approval of American leadership, says Meridian International Center’s president and CEO, former U.N. Ambassador for Special Political Affairs Stuart Holliday. The United States, a symbol of privileged first-world free-market capitalism, is often used as a scapegoat by the leaders of developing nations to “deflect attention away from their own challenges.” “There is a perception,” Holliday added, “that the United States could fix these problems if they wanted to.”To determine the countries that hate America most, 24/7 Wall St. relied data from The U.S.-Global Leadership Project, a partnership between Gallup and the Meridian International Center. Gallup also provided data from a number of other indices it produced through polling in 2011. Additional economic information came from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and data are for the most recently available year. IMF figures on GDP per capita are given at purchasing-power-parity in order to show real differences in wealth. Life expectancy comes from the World Bank and is for the most recently available year.These are the 10 countries that hate America the most according to 24/7 Wall St."

Throughout 2012, banks faced scrutiny as drama ensued. JPMorgan Chase lost $6 billion in a complex series of trades. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2ebf520000030000012a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before Thursday, the fallout from JPMorgan Chase's $6.2 billion losses from the ""London Whale"" trade seemed limited to a scuffed reputation and some uncertain future legal liability. A scathing Senate report about the trade has changed this calculus, with the nation's largest bank and its chief executives now possibly to be cast as defendants in lawsuits and against enforcement actions by regulators, legal scholars said.""There seems to be plausible reason to believe that investors were misled,"" said Arthur Wilmarth, a banking law professor at The George Washington University.Wilmarth and other legal scholars reached by HuffPost on Friday declined to make firm predictions about what might happen, but said investigations and fines, and possibly a large monetary settlement, seemed possible based on compelling evidence presented in the report that CEO Jamie Dimon and others withheld damaging information from investors and the public. Securities law requires publicly traded companies to disclose information that could ""materially"" change the stock price. Though the specifics are different, the conduct described in the report is similar to that that has led to regulators taking legal action in the past.Barring a major change in approach by the Justice Department, a criminal prosecution is highly unlikely, the experts told HuffPost. Criminal cases require a higher burden of proof to convict -- meaning that they are harder to win -- and Attorney General Eric Holder recently suggested the agency's approach stems from a belief that some banks are too big to prosecute.That leaves civil cases, in which penalties are measured in fines instead of jail sentences, as the most likely option. The most likely agency to bring such a case is the Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency set up to protect investors.In contrast to the DOJ, the SEC has brought a slew of financial crisis-related lawsuits in recent years. How a London Whale case might shape up is unclear, but the type of misconduct described in the 300-page report invites comparison to cases accusing Goldman Sachs of betting against mortgage products even as the bank was peddling those same investments to clients, and accusing Citigroup for misleading investors about the harm bad investments were causing the bank's balance sheet.JPMorgan is also the target of one of these types of cases stemming from the actions of traders at Bear Stearns, the investment bank it acquired in 2008. That case was brought last fall by the New York attorney general, and includes snippets of internal emails in which traders used crude language to describe what it was selling. One bond was a ""sack of shit,"" a trader said. The Senate report, which preceded a long, uncomfortable hearing on Friday featuring some of the same executives singled out as having deceived investors and regulators, includes similarly inflammatory language. JPMorgan traders reportedly called regulators from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ""stupid,"" and others fretted in an email that ""we are going to crash.""The report also includes evidence that senior-most executives, including Dimon, approved a change to how the bank calculated risk. During Friday's hearing. Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said that the bank ""changed pricing practices after losses piled up.""Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said at the outset of the hearing that the London Whale trade was not the action of ""rogue traders"" and said that ""superiors were well aware of their activities.""This type of evidence led the SEC to directly target Dimon and other top bankers, though the SEC has mostly avoided charging senior bank executives in financial crisis-related cases. With former bank lawyer Mary Jo White all but certain to take the reigns as the next commissioner, legal scholars said they are interested to see if the dynamic has changed. White is a respected former federal prosecutor, but spent the past decade defending banks and large companies, including JPMorgan.""This is a test case for Mary Jo White,"" Wilmarth said. Given her history with the bank, though, it is possible that she might recuse herself from any investigation.Whatever happens, one certainty is that JPMorgan will fight hard against any legal charges, said Saule Omarova, a banking law professor at the University of North Carolina, and a former Treasury official. Omarova said that the financial industry has used the complexity of the financial markets as a shield against their complicity in any failed trade. That the Whale case involves something called a synthetic credit derivative underscores this point, she said.""We made a bad business decision,"" she said, adopting the typical defense in one of these cases. Another factor that makes these cases difficult for the government to win is the disparity of firepower between federal agencies and the financial industry, legal scholars said. The latter can afford to hire huge teams of experienced and talented lawyers that know how to raise just the kinds of doubts that can scuttle cases. Lawyers, in fact, just like Mary Jo White. "

But he was now taking his message to an unusual audience for a central banker: a high-profile Republican political action committee.Fisher said the existence of banks that are seen as likely to receive government bailouts if they fail gives them an unfair advantage, hurting economic competitiveness.""These institutions operate under a privileged status that exacts an unfair tax upon the American people,"" he said on the last day of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).""They represent not only a threat to financial stability but to fair and open competition  (and) are the practitioners of crony capitalism and not the agents of democratic capitalism that makes our country great,"" said Fisher, who has also been a vocal opponent of the Fed's unconventional monetary stimulus policies.Fisher's vision pits him directly against Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who recently argued during congressional testimony that regulators had made significant progress in addressing the problem of too big to fail. Bernanke asserted that market expectations that large financial institutions would be rescued is wrong.But Fisher said mega banks still have a significant funding advantage over its competitors, as well as other advantages. To address this problem, he called for a rolling back of deposit insurance so that it would extend only to deposits of commercial banks, not the investment arms of bank holding companies.""At the Dallas Fed, we believe that whatever the precise subsidy number is, it exists, it is significant, and it allows the biggest banking organizations, along with their many nonbank subsidiaries - investment firms, securities lenders, finance companies - to grow larger and riskier,"" he said.Fisher argued Dodd-Frank financial reforms were overly complex and therefore counterproductive.""Regulators cannot enforce rules that are not easily understood,"" he said.

By that I mean that though it's a bona fide religious holiday, you don't need to be particularly pious to enjoy it.Beyond its religious significance, Wikipedia aptly describes March 17th as a celebration of Irish history and identity, including ""...prominent displays of the color green, feasting, copious consumption of alcohol, religious observances, and numerous parades.""That kind of says it all, doesn't it? St. Patrick's Day gives us all an excuse to wear something green and over-imbibe.A fondness for spirits is, of course, an integral part of the Irish character. There are lighter and darker sides to this truth. But the Irish hardly have a monopoly on the use and enjoyment of alcohol. It is in fact pretty much universal -- and universally, it can be a source of joy and fun, as well as misery.Not surprisingly, the best movies about drinking reflect both sides of the equation, sometimes making us laugh, but also reminding us how alcohol can unleash a ravaging, devastating disease for those genetically pre-disposed -- a disease that causes suffering not just for the victims, but in almost equal measure, their families and friends.Wishing everyone a safe and (reasonably) responsible holiday, I present my own candidates for the top drinking movies of all time.The Thin Man (1934): The quintessential martini movie, Powell and Loy's chic sleuths have fun, solve a murder, and hold their liquor -- but just barely. ""Ammunition!""The Bank Dick (1940): It's always fun hanging out with Egbert Souse (accent grave over the ""e"") at the immoral (and immortal) Black Pussycat Café.The Lost Weekend (1945): Billy Wilder's shattering, groundbreaking drama about an alcoholic writer's disintegration. Ray Milland's Oscar -- and he earned it.A Star Is Born (1954): James Mason's turn as Hollywood star turned drunk is one for the ages. Highlight: when he accidentally slaps Judy at the Awards ceremony. Unforgettable.Rio Bravo (1959): Dean Martin's boozing deputy may just be the best thing he ever did on film. And yes, that includes all those celebrity roasts! It's hard to overshadow the Duke, but this is really Dino's movie.  Days Of Wine And Roses (1962): Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick break your heart as married tipplers. The scene where Jack destroys the greenhouse still packs a wallop, half a century later.Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? (1966): Liz and Dick's finest hour happens at cocktail hour, with alcohol fueling Edward Albee's corrosive dialogue. ""Never mix- never worry!""National Lampoon's Animal House (1978): Gloriously nutty college farce, with John Belushi's Bluto the poster boy for nihilistic excess consumption. ""To-ga! To-ga!""My Favorite Year (1982): Overlooked comedy set in the golden age of live television with Peter O'Toole playing a former swashbuckling movie star turned lush. Best line: ""Of course he's beneath us. He's an actor!""The Verdict (1982): Paul Newman is brilliant as an alcoholic ambulance chaser who lands a big case he's unlikely to win, but which gives him one last shot at reclaiming his career and self-respect.Under The Volcano (1984): Albert Finney gives a tour-de-force performance as a dissolute diplomat whose alcoholism is spiraling out of control in a small, seedy Mexican town.Withnail and I (1987): Richard E. Grant shines as a broke, bitchy, drunken actor in this scathing black comedy, which has (deservedly) attained cult status.Leaving Las Vegas (1995): Nicolas Cage snagged an Oscar for his intense, haunted turn as a screenwriter in despair who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death.The Big Lebowski (1998): The dude abides, even in the midst of a bizarre case of mistaken identity. And can he pack in those White Russians! A Coen Brothers peak.Bridesmaids (2011): By combining booze and pills, maid of honor Kristen Wiig flips out on a plane to Vegas, paving the way for one wildly eventful bachelorette excursion. It's one of the funniest movie scenes in years.Looking for good movies to watch? Top movie recommendations?

Call us weird, but it feels great to use a little elbow grease and give our homes a deep scrub. But we know this isn't everybody's favorite activity, so we thought we'd make it a little easier by putting together a stress-free spring cleaning checklist, starting with the kitchen. So go through these tasks step by step, and your ""heart of the home"" will be sparkling in no time. Start with your freezer.Unplug it or turn off the power to let it defrost. Then, remove all of the contents and wipe it out thoroughly using a solution of one tablespoon of baking soda per one quart of hot water. If there are still lingering odors, this post will help you determine the root of the problem. Get your oven and stove gleaming. Remove all of the appliance's knobs and burners and soak them in vinegar to loosen debris, rinsing them well before replacing them. We even have a little trick to make the inside smell delicious. Clean your refrigerator to make it more efficient. Move it out from against the wall (if you can) to sweep behind it,  and remove the grill to clean the coils. This will boost energy output, saving you money in the long run. We also have a creative tip to remove grime  using... pantyhose. Buff your stainless steel appliances. To make your metal look good-as-new, we have a great tip for mixing a DIY cleaner using a surprising baking ingredient. Scrub the sink.  This is one of the  dirtiest spots in your home, so make a paste with baking soda and water and get in the nooks and crannies using a toothbrush. Make your floors shine.  First, sweep up loose crumbs and dust. Then, with a damp mop, give it a deep clean with a great natural floor cleaner made from olive oil and lemons. Don't forget the ceiling. Cooking grime  from smoke and moisture builds up over time, so give this surprising surface a scrub, too.
