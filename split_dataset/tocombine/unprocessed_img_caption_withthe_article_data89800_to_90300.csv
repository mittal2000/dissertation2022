The state Attorney General's Office argued the complaints against Lucas should be dismissed regardless of the court's findings about the constitutionality of the law, since it believes her statements were opinions, not facts.The American Civil Liberties Union and local civil rights groups have submitted amicus briefs supporting Lucas' contention that the law is unconstitutional.

Is the newly-minted closer worth the adulation and the money, or is the mystique just a myth?",2015-05-07,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA - OCTOBER 15: Santiago Casilla #46 of the San Francisco Giants reacts after getting the final out in the ninth inning against the St. Louis Cardinals during Game Four of the National League Championship Series at AT&T Park on October 15, 2014 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Harry How/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77d641f00003901250ab4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As baseball season gets into full swing, we hear lots of buzz about the closer -- baseball's newest position. Is the newly-minted closer worth the adulation and the money, or is the mystique just a myth?For over a century baseball had nine positions on the field. Then came the designated hitter and more recently the feared closer. The DH is a specialist, playing only offense. The closer is a specialist too -- a relief pitcher coming to work the ninth inning with his team ahead by no more than three runs. But why is the ninth inning with a lead different than any other? It's not, but sports writer Jerome Holtzman came up with the concept of a ""save"" that gave rise to the closer, that led to the mystique of the closer, that led to exorbitantly high salaries. Mariano Rivera and Joe Nathan and lots of other closers owe Holtzman big time. The closer is supposed to unnerve opposing batters. I am reminded of Valdez, a B cowboy movie from the fifties. Ads for the movie said ""Valdez is coming."" Brave men shivered in their boots and women would run and hide. Now fanfare and music greet the closer and the opposing batters shiver in their spikes and meekly make outs. The mystique of the closer makes great drama, drains the team's coffers and increases the bank accounts of the closers. The going rate for a recognized closer is $10-15 million per year, while other relief pitchers who may be just as good might get $5 million. Mariano Rivera and Joe Nathan have the highest close percentages of all time -- each saving about 89 percent of their opportunities over their careers. Sounds good, but how important was that to their teams? Well, a baseball stat geek recently looked at every major league game in history. When a team leads by one run going into the ninth inning, it wins 86 percent of the time, 94 percent when winning by two runs, and 96 percent when winning by three runs. All of a sudden 89 percent for the very best of all time doesn't impress so much. How about the contribution of Mariano Rivera to the New York Yankees over his long tenure as their closer? During the 16 years (1997 through 2012), the Yankees had the best overall regular-season record in baseball. The Pirates had the worst record. Now the Pirates' closers over those 16 years were the famous and feared, what's their names? Right, I don't remember either. Anyway, if in those years the Yankees were leading going in the ninth inning they won 97.2 percent of their games, while the lowly Pirates only won 94.7 percent of theirs. This translates into about 1.5 games per year from the worst team to the best team; from a bunch of unremembered closers to the best ever.In San Francisco where I live, for a few years there was ""fear the beard"" as Brian Wilson saved games and saved the day for the Giants. Fans loved the high drama, but did the Beard really make a difference? In 2010, Wilson was the closer and the Giants won the World Series. In 2012 he was injured and pitched in only two innings all season, so it was closer by committee. But the Giants won again. In 2013 the Giants had a new great closer in Sergio Romo (who saved 88 percent of his opportunities) and the Giants finished 16 games out in the National League West. But what happened in 2011? At the start of the season Wilson was doing his usual job and had saved 35 out of 40 opportunities (87.5 percent). He was then injured and forced to miss over a month of the season, and the Giants fell out of contention while he was on the disabled list. During spring training the next season, the San Francisco Chronicle ran an article with the headline ""Giants Know High Cost of Losing Closer."" Really, I wondered. So I did my homework. While Wilson was away the Giants' closers went seven out of eight, or 87.5 percent. Does that number sounds familiar? But wait. The one blown save that the Giants pitching staff had was in the seventh inning of one game. Wilson would not have pitched in the seventh-inning because he was ""the closer."" This means to me that that while Wilson was away the ninth inning closers saved seven out of seven. Tough to beat that. So my conclusion is that had Wilson been healthy and pitched, the Giants could only have done worse. Wow, that is a high cost!The Giants won again in 2014 despite losing their closer from 2013, Sergio Romo. They technically didn't lose him, but Romo's poor performance resulted in a demotion to becoming the setup man. Santiago Casilla took over the closer's role. Interestingly enough for 2014 both Romo and Casilla saved 82 percent of their opportunities. That's a low figure for ninth-inning closers, but did not keep the Giants out of postseason play.Even the Atlanta Braves, who have been so smart in utilizing their pitchers over the years, couldn't resist falling for the myth of the closer. From 2001 through 2004 they turned John Smoltz, one of the great starting pitchers of his era, into their closer. Why would anyone in his right mind want to turn a superstar who consistently pitched effectively in over 200 innings per season into a closer who could be used for maybe 70 innings? Could the reason be perception and baseball lore and the facts be damned? In 2003 Smoltz went on the DL in September. Replacing him as closer were a few relievers and some starters seeking to reestablish themselves. During that September I happened to see a televised game in which one of the Braves' substitute closers saved the day. Nonetheless the television announcer dutifully informed all of us fans that the Braves was just not the same without Smoltz as the closer. He had been on the DL for 15 days at that point. Number of saves the Braves' pitching staff blew while he was out those 15 days -- zero, nada, rien, gar nicht.Mariano Rivera, the greatest closer of all time, retired from the Yankees at the end of the 2013 season. During his major league career he saved 89 percent of his chances. In his last year, 2013, he saved 86 percent of his chances. The prior two years were 84 percent and 90 percent. Could it be the reason the Yankees failed to make the playoffs in 2014 was the absence of Rivera? Guess not. In their bull pen, the Yankees found David Robertson, who became the new closer and miraculously saved 89 percent of his chances. In 2014 Robertson's salary was about $5 million less than the Yankees paid Rivera in 2013. It was about $10 million less than they paid Rivera in 2012. Proving once again that the graveyard is full of indispensable people.The math tells us that the mystique of the closer is a myth. In reality, if the ""closer"" is the best relief pitcher, it would be better to use him with say, bases loaded and one out in the eighth inning and his team tied or down by one run than to save him for when his team is up two or three runs in the ninth. Still, the buzz and the drama probably won't go away anytime soon. People want to believe in something and what better than the closer? Never mind the stats. If I were general manger with $15 million to spend, I just might get three good relief pitchers and let them cheerfully share closing duties. Or maybe a good hitter or two would be a better investment. I am reminded of the lyrics from a folk song from my youth: ""Oh, when will they ever learn?

4,POLITICS,Progressive Groups Urge North Carolina Governor Not To Break Abortion Promise,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-abortion-_n_7233494.html,,2015-05-07,"FILE - In this Feb. 4, 2015 file photo, Gov. Pat McCrory delivers his State of the State address to a joint session of the General Assembly in Raleigh, N.C. When McCrory was running for governor, he pledged to run an open and transparent administration. But since he took office in 2013, the release of information requested under the state√¢¬Ä¬ôs public records laws has slowed to a crawl. Some requests have languished for nearly two years. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f63f2500008b013a5da6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Progressive groups are traveling around North Carolina urging Gov. Pat McCrory (R) to keep a campaign promise not to sign any new restrictions on abortion. The bill heading toward McCrory would triple the state‚Äôs waiting period before patients could access the procedure -- from 24 hours to 72 hours. Just four states currently have a 72-hour waiting period -- including Oklahoma, where Gov. Mary Fallin (R) signed the measure on Thursday -- while 24-hour requirements are relatively common. But an increasing number of states are adding or lengthening such waiting periods.The North Carolina legislation passed the Republican-controlled state House in late April and is now sitting in the state Senate Judiciary Committee. That panel is expected to consider the measure within the next two weeks. The proposed legislation would also mandate that doctors share medical records, like ultrasound images, with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services if an abortion was performed after 18 weeks or if a pregnancy ended in miscarriage. Doctors warn that such a requirement is a medically unnecessary invasion of patient privacy, while reproductive rights advocates worry that the provision would make it easier to intimidate doctors who perform abortions. To highlight McCrory‚Äôs promise during a 2012 gubernatorial campaign debate that he would not sign new restrictions on abortion access -- a promise that he already broke in 2013 -- NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina, Planned Parenthood‚Äôs South Atlantic Action League, Progress NC and other groups are rallying in towns across the state. Accompanying them is a 30-foot billboard truck with a picture of McCrory and the words ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt break your promise again.‚Äù The tour will culminate with a demonstration at the governor‚Äôs mansion on May 11.‚ÄúWe find this to be medically unnecessary, we find this to be bad medicine, we find this to be bad law and bad for the people of North Carolina,‚Äù Shoshannah Sayers, interim executive director of NARAL Pro Choice North Carolina, said at a Monday rally, according to The Charlotte Observer. Republican supporters of abortion waiting periods argue that they give patients more time to gather information and consider their decision. Democratic opponents contend that such requirements shame and patronize women with the goal of making it more difficult to access the procedure. Medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists oppose waiting periods, noting that abortion is safer the earlier it‚Äôs done. McCrory has not yet said whether he would sign the bill. States passed more abortion restrictions from 2011 through 2013 than during the entire previous decade, following a Republican sweep of state legislatures in the 2010 elections. "

No matter what happens to the world or even her, she is there for you in your need; she recognizes your need much before you know it. Of course every day is Mother's day, and each one of us honors her in a variety of ways. From simple caring to doing things for her that makes her happy. Mothers don't need a whole lot; they just need to know that you care. Remember you were showered by her attention when you needed it.Every religious tradition has elevated mother to nearly the status of God, because she possess many a qualities of God; kind, merciful, beneficent and caring among thousand other qualities. Mother is the reason for our existence; sustenance, nurturance and shaping who we are. I dedicate this write-up to my Mother, and all the Mothers out there. There is a beautiful song in Urdu/Hindi languageUs ko nahin dekha hum ne kabhi, per us ki zaroorat kya hogi Ai maa teri soorat say alag bhagwan ki soorat kya hogi.I have not seen him (God) ever, but what is the need for it? Dear Mother, your face cannot be different than God's own face Here is the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HbmbO0b-Sc&feature=youtu.beFull translation by Rajiv Chakravarti at www.Urduhindi.net Thanks to this beautiful tradition of America, a day to honor Mother. No mother should be alone today; some one or the other must give her a call. I appreciate all the mothers who have raised their kids well, particularly the single mothers, and it is not easy! Getting them ready, taking them to school, playground, tuition, and taking care of them, and going to work. There is a lot of sacrifice made by mothers and no amount of appreciation will be enough. Whatever you are today, it is because of your mother. If you have tensions with her, seek her forgiveness today, if she is not around, spend half an hour meditating about her and see the sense of completeness you feel within you. A majority of us are fortunate to have the love and affection of the mother to bless our lives. However, there are some mothers who have not been good to their kids and I feel your anguish if you are the one, but I assure you that, you are a blessed one to have made it in life without mothers love and it is time for you to give that love to others. It's time to express gratitude to her; it restores the spiritual balance in each one of us. Life is about transactions, each time we received a ""good"" we become indebted to the giver, but when we give back to the giver or find alternate ways of giving back, then we regain our spiritual balance, bringing us nirvana, salvation, mukti, moksha, nijaat and freedom.  RELIGIONS ON MOTHERS: In the native traditions, be it American, European, African, or Asian, Mother is creator in the form of mother Earth.Christianity and Judaism: ""Honor your father and mother. Then you will live a long, full life in the land the LORD your God will give you. In Jewish tradition, your heritage is determined by your Mother, you are a Jew because of your mother.""Diverse images of what are believed to be Mother Goddesses also have been discovered that date from the Neolithic period, the New Stone Age, which ranges from approximately 10,000 BCE when the use of wild cereals led to the beginning of farming, and eventually, to agriculture."" WikipediaThe Baha'i faith, ""For mothers are the first educators, the first mentors; and truly it is the mothers who determine the happiness, the future greatness, the courteous ways and learning and judgment, the understanding and the faith of their little ones.""In the Hindu tradition Mother is worshiped and is represented in many attributes like Ma Saraswati (source of knowledge), Ma Lakshmi (source of income) and the likes... Mother's face is equated with God's face, a song celebrates Mother by saying, if I have seen your face mother, and I have seen God.Sikh's consider God as a parent, a mother and a father. Guru Granth Sahib advises ""Always remember the boundless, limitless God, remembering whom all our sins are destroyed. My son, this is a mother's prayer for you."" Prophet Muhammad was asked by his associates, who is the most important person in one's life - he says, ""Mother""; they ask again, the answer was ""Mother again"" and same response was given for the third time, such is the importance given to mother. He said, your heaven, your paradise and your peace of mind comes to you by serving your mother.You will find mother is placed at the highest spiritual level in all religions or non-religious traditions and life forms. Those who have a mother to see, you are the blessed one, those who don't, you have her blessings.""Paradise is under the feet of your mother"" is the mantra probably every Muslim recites and it is part of Hindu, Sikh, Jain and South Asian culture as well. The idea is of gratitude, if you are grateful to you mother, then you would be grateful to the creator and other benefactors around you.In 2001, my Mother passed away in one of the most beautiful manners one could embark on the eternal journey; a clean slate with no loose ends.

Elizabeth Warren on the left to Republican presidential prospect Jeb Bush on the right decrying the widening gap between the wealthy and everyone else. But Americans aren√¢¬Ä¬ôt nearly as fascinated by the issue as their leaders seem to be. (AP Photo, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31fc1250000320038a35d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What will happen to American jobs, incomes, and wealth a decade from now?Predictions are hazardous but survivable. In 1991, in my book The Work of Nations, I separated almost all work into three categories, and then predicted what would happen to each of them.The first category I called ""routine production services,"" which entailed the kind of repetitive tasks performed by the old foot soldiers of American capitalism through most of the twentieth century -- done over and over, on an assembly line or in an office. I estimated that such work then constituted about one-quarter of all jobs in the United States, but would decline steadily as such jobs were replaced by new labor-saving technologies and by workers in developing nations eager to do them for far lower wages. I also assumed the pay of remaining routine production workers in America would drop, for similar reasons.I was not far wrong.The second category I called ""in-person services."" This work had to be provided personally because the ""human touch"" was essential to it. It included retail sales workers, hotel and restaurant workers, nursing-home aides, realtors, childcare workers, home health-care aides, flight attendants, physical therapists, and security guards, among many others. In 1990, by my estimate, such workers accounted for about 30 percent of all jobs in America, and I predicted their numbers would grow because -- given that their services were delivered in person -- neither advancing technologies nor foreign-based workers would be able to replace them.I also predicted their pay would drop. They would be competing with a large number of former routine production workers, who could only find jobs in the ""in-person"" sector. They would also be competing with labor-saving machinery such as automated tellers, computerized cashiers, automatic car washes, robotized vending machines, and self-service gas pumps -- as well as ""personal computers linked to television screens"" through which ""tomorrow's consumers will be able to buy furniture, appliances, and all sorts of electronic toys from their living rooms -- examining the merchandise from all angles, selecting whatever color, size, special features, and price seem most appealing, and then transmitting the order instantly to warehouses from which the selections will be shipped directly to their homes. So, too, with financial transactions, airline and hotel reservations, rental car agreements, and similar contracts, which will be executed between consumers in their homes and computer banks somewhere else on the globe.""Here again, my predictions were not far off. But I didn't foresee how quickly advanced technologies would begin to make inroads even on in-person services. Ten years from now I expect Amazon will have wiped out many of today's retail jobs, and Google's self-driving car will eliminate many bus drivers, truck drivers, sanitation workers, and even Uber drivers.The third job category I named ""symbolic-analytic services."" Here I included all the problem-solving, problem-identifying, and strategic thinking that go into the manipulation of symbols - data, words, oral and visual representations. I estimated in 1990 that symbolic analysts accounted for 20 percent of all American jobs, and expected their share to continue to grow, as would their incomes, because the demand for people to do these jobs would continue to outrun the supply of people capable of doing them. This widening disconnect between symbolic-analytic jobs and the other two major categories of work would, I predicted, be the major force driving widening inequality.Again, I wasn't far off. But I didn't anticipate how quickly or how wide the divide would become, or how great a toll inequality and economic insecurity would take. I would never have expected, for example, that the life expectancy of an American white woman without a high school degree would decrease by five years between 1990 and 2008.We are now faced not just with labor-replacing technologies but with knowledge-replacing technologies. The combination of advanced sensors, voice recognition, artificial intelligence, big data, text-mining, and pattern-recognition algorithms, is generating smart robots capable of quickly learning human actions, and even learning from one another. A revolution in life sciences is also underway, allowing drugs to be tailored to a patient's particular condition and genome.If the current trend continues, many more symbolic analysts will be replaced in coming years. The two largest professionally intensive sectors of the United States -- health care and education -- will be particularly affected because of increasing pressures to hold down costs and, at the same time, the increasing accessibility of expert machines. ""We are now faced not just with labor-replacing technologies but with knowledge-replacing technologies.""We are on the verge of a wave of mobile health applications, for example, measuring everything from calories to blood pressure, along with software programs capable of performing the same functions as costly medical devices and diagnostic software that can tell you what it all means and what to do about it.Schools and universities will likewise be reorganized around smart machines (although faculties will scream all the way). Many teachers and university professors are already on the way to being replaced by software -- so-called ""MOOCs"" (Massive Open Online Courses) and interactive online textbooks -- along with adjuncts that guide student learning.As a result, income and wealth will become even more concentrated than they are today. Those who create or invest in blockbuster ideas will earn unprecedented sums and returns. The corollary is they will have enormous political power. But most people will not share in the monetary gains, and their political power will disappear. The middle class's share of the total economic pie will continue to shrink, while the share going to the very top will continue to grow. But the current trend is not preordained to last, and only the most rigid technological determinist would assume this to be our inevitable fate. We can -- indeed, I believe we must -- ignite a political movement to reorganize the economy for the benefit of the many, rather than for the lavish lifestyles of a precious few and their heirs.

13,POLITICS,Clinton Campaign Chairman On Trade Deal: 'Can You Make It Go Away?',Ryan Grim and Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-tpp_n_7207240.html,,2015-05-06,"Counselor to U.S. president John D. Podesta listens during a news conference at the U.S. embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, Monday, Sept. 29, 2014. A senior adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday that Afghanistan will sign a deal Tuesday to allow American soldiers to remain in the country past the end of the year. (AP Photo/Massoud Hossaini)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f5763c000018010e027f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Sunday called on Hillary Clinton to help him and President Barack Obama push a major free trade deal through Congress. The unlikely Boehner-Obama alliance is battling opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership from tea party Republicans as well as rank-and-file Democrats. ""She can't sit on the sidelines and let the president swing in the wind here,"" Boehner said. Or can she? To pile a third cliche on the heap, Clinton, a candidate for president and Obama's former secretary of state, has little interest in putting her shoulder to this particular wheel. At a closed-door gathering of wealthy progressive donors in April, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was asked how the campaign would deal with the issue. ""Can you make it go away?"" Podesta replied jokingly, according to sources in the room at the time. His quip was an acknowledgement that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a thorny political issue, but he didn't elaborate on Clinton's stance. Podesta, a source close to him said, was referring to the fight over trade promotion authority, or TPA. Known as ""fast track,"" TPA would grease the skids for trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. If fast track passes, Congress would have 60 days to debate the trade deal and vote it up or down, with no opportunity to amend it. The source also said Podesta was speaking more in the context of how difficult the issue was for Democrats in general, not Clinton in particular. A Senate vote on TPA may come within weeks, or sooner. Podesta's lament is born of a simple political calculation: Any benefits that might come from the vast trade deal, if they do, won't appear for years, while the down payment on the political price will be due upfront. The progressive base is strongly opposed to the deal, and largely considers NAFTA, the major free trade deal pushed through by President Bill Clinton, to have contributed significantly to the erosion of the middle class. Hillary Clinton invites a progressive backlash if she helps push TPA through, but may jeopardize her business support and alienate Obama with full-throated opposition. If TPA passes, the issue won't go away, as Congress would be allowed a 60-day period to review the final draft, which isn't yet complete. On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said he would block the measure until the Senate first deals with a stalled infrastructure bill and a package of surveillance reforms, a tactic the White House pushed back on. Reid also suggested Boehner do some of his own work instead of calling on a Democratic presidential candidate to help him out. Republican support for the trade deal is lukewarm at best in the House, with tea party activists seeing the deal as a step toward one-world government.""I think he‚Äôs got all these Republican hotshots there, he's got all the business community supporting him. He can do it on his own. He doesn't need Hillary,"" Reid told The Huffington Post Monday. Clinton has been cautious about Obama's TPP deal since launching her campaign. Last month, a campaign spokesman said she ""will be watching closely to see what is being done to crack down on currency manipulation"" and to ""improve labor rights, protect the environment and health"" in the final deal. ""We shouldn't be giving special rights to corporations at the expense of workers and consumers,"" the statement read.In her book, Hard Choices, Clinton also expressed concern about a key piece of the trade agreement, writing that the United States ""should avoid some of the provisions sought by business interests, including our own, like giving them or their investors the power to sue foreign governments to weaken their environmental and public health rules, as Philip Morris is already trying to do in Australia.""While it is widely described as a trade deal, much of the agreement deals with corporate governance issues, seeking to find ""regulatory harmony"" among different nations -- which can often mean weakening regulations. The provision Clinton referred to is known as ""investor-state dispute settlement,"" which allows foreign companies to attack domestic laws or regulations before an international tribunal if they believe those rules unfairly curb investment returns. Those tribunals can't directly overturn laws, but they can impose hefty fines on the countries they rule against.Sign up below to get Ryan's quasi-newsletter in your inbox.

It analyzed how certain consumer products catch on ""in a cluttered marketplace"" -- a sort of pre-Gladwellian analysis of cachet. He enthused about Us Weekly, the then-recently revitalized publication that I was editing at the time. Pressman called Us Weekly the ""iPod of its industry,"" adding, ""like crack on newsprint, it made an entirely dormant segment into a monster loyal audience.""But as anyone who follows celebrity knows, those ""cool"" days have faded. Sales of every newsstand publication reliant on the right face at the right time have plummeted, ratings of entertainment news shows are down, Hollywood rarely mints big new stars anymore, and the breathless market for ""exclusives"" and baby reveals (coined the ""celebrity industrial complex"") has gone the way of Dutch Tulips (save, for say, the occasional new British princess). Some reasons for the ennui are obvious: oversaturation, the Internet, smart phones and social media's supplanting of traditional media outlets as middleman. More telling: The ruling class simply stopped caring the way it once did. In Us Weekly's heyday, young women in New York City who wouldn't have been caught dead reading mom-sy People magazine or downmarket Star in public rode the subway inhaling the novel, newsy entrant, making its ""Just Like Us"" ethos a catchphrase of the decade. Measured independently in 2008 by research organization MRI, Us Weekly's 11 million readers were two-thirds college-educated, with a household income of $72,000, ahead of Vogue and Vanity Fair. Those stats meant that in 2007 we could get candidate Barack Obama to invite a reporter on his campaign; his rival, Hillary Clinton, to Fashion Police her own outfits, and then be covered by The New Yorker because of that. Ivy League types debated at dinner the day's pressing topics: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck; Britney Spears shaving her head; or whatever iteration of Brad (Pitt), Angelina (Jolie) and Jen (Aniston) was at play. George W. Bush was president, 9/11 had just happened, and an ill-conceived war was raging in Iraq. Celebrity was a weapon of mass distraction, a preferred medium of communication -- even for the future president. During that era, copycat publications emerged, as did Perez Hilton, TMZ and many more websites amounting to millions of page views with the same commodity: celebrity news and photos. Some were great, some weren't, others were fawning. But all of them required you cared endlessly about Lindsay Lohan's car crashes (real and metaphysical), who wore something better, or the confessions and woes of every marginal ""star."" The ""white noise"" effect kicked in, and 24/7 celebrity news and scandal began to sound like the teacher in Charlie Brown. It also ceased to be ""cool."" After all, something viewed as too available simply couldn't be.So where does this leave the future's celebrity-dependent magazine covers and media? That may seem an anachronistic question in a digital age. Yet in the web's infinite landscape, where anyone can be the star of his own Vine, covers actually matter more. Remember, commodities rise in value when they are in limited supply. Could Kim Kardashian have broken the Internet with an Instagram post of her bare derriere? Maybe. But it became a sensation thanks to its ""cool"" status on 6-times-a year Paper magazine (see, it was art, not pornography!). And Vogue may have had average sales on that Kim and Kanye West cover, but it gave the couple the only 12-times-a-year imprimatur of tastemaker Anna Wintour. Comparatively few saw or touched the physical copies of those issues. No surprise. At The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard where I now work, our 35 million monthly visitors (comScore) dwarf our print circulation. Newsstand sales are irrelevant, as they will be for every single title in the next 10 years. And while that's potentially threatening as an editor, it also is liberating. Yes, my staff carefully curates gorgeous, luxurious print editions that I like to think are smarter than any out there, and we won a National Magazine Award this year. But the ultimate goal is to make these pieces catch fire online, which opens wide who can be on a cover. At People magazine in the '90s, the editor said to never put a star on who wasn't ubiquitously known. Today, I'd argue for the opposite, as the Internet masses grow weary fast and the consumer base of female newsstand-buying grocery shoppers shrinks. Innovators and originality are rewarded online in a way that safety (say, the 1,000 magazine cover of Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock) historically has been in print. At The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard, we have a combined 90 covers a year to take a chance. Sometimes we are lucky and get Chris Rock, whose bylined Hollywood Reporter cover on racism in entertainment -- hardly supermarket fare -- was read online by nearly 900,000 people (and counting). Recently, we featured Roger Ailes, the rarely profiled chairman of Fox News. He is 74 and polarizing, and the photo was black and white. Yet, within 24 hours of the story posting, a 4,200-word piece from a magazine that prints 72,000 copies was read online by 400,000 people. Its cover image sat atop the Drudge Report for hours. Rupert Murdoch's chief of staff tweeted a photo of the Australian billionaire in his L.A. office reading the cover. The print edition. A 360-degree modern media win. Oprah Winfrey said at one of our events that no matter how big her interview subject, the person always asked afterward, ""Did I do all right?"" Her point: validation matters. To everyone, reader and subject alike. The digital audience -- especially the digital audience -- craves these signposts amid a 24/7 culture of quizzes, lists and an endless social media loop of outrage. Maybe in the near future, as reality TV shows decline in ratings, and banality hits a bear market, a Vanity Fair or People could steer clear of the canned A-list interviews and take a chance on a Silicon Valley star, or the right TED talker-turned Internet icon. All editors, unburdened of the Sisyphean task of maintaining newsstand sales, could try more interesting, less available people -- a commodity as scarce as actual covers themselves. After all, everything is deliciously upside down: a trade (as both my titles once were) can now be more mass than a mass title; and creative people once accessible only to thought leaders in quirky publications are now available to millions online. Talk about ""cool."" It could be a great future where sometimes, yes, even Roger Ailes can be the web's Kim Kardashian for the day.

It's often said that the Chinese, for example, respect the elderly and revere age in a way that is foreign to Americans who treat age as a burden.",2015-05-06,2015-05-05-1430837602-208797-220pxConfucius_Tang_Dynasty.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430837602-208797-220pxConfucius_Tang_Dynasty-thumb.jpg,"Does wisdom come with age? It's often said that the Chinese, for example, respect the elderly and revere age in a way that is foreign to Americans who treat age as a burden. The Buddhist cultures of countries like Thailand and Cambodia also venerate the dead in a way that is anathema to Western Culture for which ""carpe diem"" is the most popular shibboleth. Westerners live it up like there's no tomorrow while if you go to a Buddhist temple in say Vietnam you will find cardboard boxes which once housed appliances being offered up on pyres, so that the dead will be taken care of in the afterlife. But all that being said, it's hard to feel there's much to venerate in age. The brain declines and the calmness one may read into an aging face is not so much the result of an overarching wisdom, as a loss of brain cells. Any serenity you might detect is the result of resignation, or worse dementia. As Jaques says in As You Like It, ""Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is Second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.""If you turn to CNN, during those hours that attract an older demographic of retirees, you will find advertisements for daily Cialis which is prescribed for both ED and BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia). The drug treats accidents and makes it possible to have an erection in a case one accidentally feel desire. It's a hardly a celebration of anything. The same is true of using drugs that deal with aging appearance. If you take Botox and have the wrinkles and removed, the theory is you will feel and then act younger. However, the outside/in approach often has questionable results. How many women do you know who have had their faces done, their breasts lifted, their cellulite removed, vaginoplasties and rhinoplasties have seen a concomitant reformation of sensibility? Confucius or confusion? Medical science can achieve ever greater feats of longevity. But is the lust for life really such an admirable thing or is it just another form of gluttony? Certain people overstay their welcomes and other suffer with chronic diseases that are living deaths. Is the idea of prolonging a life to the point where a half sensate creature is a burden who uses up their own resources on medical care and taxes those of their children really such a great thing? One thing is certain, youth is too often wasted on the young.Confucius by Wu Daozi (680-740){This was originally post to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"

But Hines added that 'some of the things are pretty mean,' and that 'the ones about girls get taken off if the girls see them.' Yik Yak, which allows users to see posts in a radius up to eight kiolometers (five miles) is part of a flurry of new apps which offer new ways to interact anonymously in social networks.
