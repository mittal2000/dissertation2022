He needs time. He isn't strong enough. He isn't old enough. He's soft. He isn't ready.That's how some commentators saw the 7-foot-3 Latvian before last June's NBA Draft. While Kentucky's Karl-Anthony Towns and Duke's Jahlil Okafor were also 19-year-old bigs with an abundance of talent, they were considered ""sure"" things. Porzingis was a risk. Perhaps just as importantly, they were also ready to immediately contribute. And to be fair, both have done just that.Towns, whom Minnesota nabbed first overall, was named the Western Conference Rookie of the Month as he averaged over 14 points, 9 rebounds and 2 blocks. Okafor, despite Philadelphia's wretchedness, has dazzled as well, as he averaged a team-best 17 points and 8 rebounds. But it's been Porzingis, with his splendid two-way skill set, fluidity and overall toughness, whose caught the league by storm in New York City.Style points may not matter to some, but what Knicks fans have long craved for is a hungry, physical presence in the middle to anchor what's been a defensive sieve for two decades. Despite his rail-thin, generously listed 240lbs frame, Porzingis plays with a certain grit -- anger almost -- that has instantly endeared him to the Madison Square Garden faithful. He never backs down from contact, and when veterans try and push him around, he pushes right back, as if to say: ""What'd you expect?""You can hardly blame GMs for questioning a gangly 20-year-old from northeastern Europe. Who really knew if this was simply a kid that played basketball because he was tall and because it would make him millions of dollars, or because he wanted to be great? Was he the next Darko Milicic-- a workout wonder who flat out could't play -- or was he more Marc Gasol? Was he cut from the Jan Vesely cloth, or was he more like Dirk Nowitzki, as everyone hoped? So, when Phil Jackson selected him fourth in the draft, Knicks fans predictably booed... a lot. Porzingis exasperated those boos in a slew of post-draft interviews.""A lot of fans weren't happy that they drafted me, but I have to do everything that's in my hands to turn those booing fans into clapping fans,"" Porzingis said. ""There's nothing I can do. I was happy about it. I want to be a part of this organization, and I know the fans are a little harsh sometimes, but that's how it is here in New York, and I'm ready for it.""Porzingis, as he tends to be, was right. The long suffering Knicks have won just one playoff series since 2000. Their highest paid player, Carmelo Anthony, is known as a ball-stopping, volume shooter whose lack of postseason success is downright inexcusable. And their coach, Derek Fisher, is known more for an offseason scuffle with a former teammate's ex-wife than his actual coaching ability. Hope, as Morgan Freeman's character says in ""The Shawshank Redemption"", is a dangerous thing. But for Knicks fans, it is also well deserved.The Latvia native, along with his rim rattling put-back dunks and fierce effort, naturally brings an added energy to a moribund franchise in desperate need. The 10-12 Knicks aren't much of a contender, but remember that this was a 17-win team just a year ago.And Porzingis, who sees the floor at a prodigious level, has a real willingness to make the extra pass, a rarity for such an unseasoned 7-footer. Better yet, his advanced understanding of how to play the two-man game -- both with a super scorer like Anthony and with a lead guard -- has already become a legitimate issue for opposition defenses. Moreover, he converts 36 percent from long distance and has morphed into a dangerous pull-up jump shooter, a vital reason as to how he earned Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month honors.When the Knicks employ him down low, he can go off either shoulder on the block despite an obvious lack of strength. We simply do not see that from young bigs at this level -- let alone rookies.And then there is the grittiness. Porzingis chases down loose balls like he's trying to make a roster -- not like the future superstar he will become. He likes to get on the floor. And, while it was fair to wonder how his ability would translate to an 82-game slate against the best players in the world, Porzingis -- averaging nearly 15 points, 9 rebounds and 2 blocks per game -- has more than passed the early test. Best of all, in classic New York form, he's hardly bashful. ""I'm not surprising myself,"" Porzingis said. ""I knew what I was capable of. A lot of people weren't expecting much from me right away, so maybe a lot of people are surprised. But I knew what I could do. ... I knew I was able to play right now.""Whether he becomes the next Nowitzki remains to be seen. The scary part is a seemingly unlimited dose of potential that isn't excluded to the offensive end. Unlike his fellow European import Nowitzki, a former MVP, world champ and future Hall of Famer, Porzingis -- because of his length and basketball acumen -- will have an opportunity to develop into a lockdown defender and premier shot-blocker. In his last 20 games, he has averaged a robust 3 blocks per game in just 31 minutes. Those are devastating numbers, even for an elite rim protector. Porzingis' rugged style of play and diverse ability has basketball fans flocking to his jersey as well. He is big business. With the exception of reigning MVP Stephen Curry -- who has a multitude of different jerseys for sale -- no player has sold more. And there's the host of utterly absurd nicknames as well: ""Scorezingis,"" ""Zinger,"" ""Godzingis,"" ""The Notorious K.P.Z.""

Think about what will happen when his body physically matures and his already vast assortment of skills follows suit. Jackson, who made all of this possible by making the gamble on Porzinigs and not on ""safer"" picks like Justise Winslow, Frank Kaminsky or even Emmanuel Mudiay, has coached more greatness -- think Jordan, Kobe, Shaq and Scottie Pippen -- than anyone.

2,POLITICS,Senate Considering Bill That Would Open Up Access To Guns In D.C.,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-gun-laws-dc_us_5665e797e4b079b2818f8432,"In the wake of San Bernardino, lawmakers are clamoring to be heard in the gun debate.",2015-12-08,Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is the author of a bill that would repeal several of the District of Columbia's strict gun laws.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5665e8111600002900e55358.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Legislation targeting Washington, D.C.’s strict gun laws may get some movement in the Senate soon. Days after shooters in San Bernardino killed 14 and injured 21, Democrats forced votes on measures aimed at restricting suspected terrorists' access to guns and explosives, and expanding background checks. With mass shootings still in the spotlight, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) began the process Thursday to bring a bill to the chamber floor that would repeal a suite of gun restrictions in the nation’s capital. McConnell sped up consideration of the bill using Rule 14 of Senate procedure, which allows the legislation to skip the committee process, and put it on the Senate calendar, meaning the majority leader can bring it up at any time. The bill, authored by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), would remove criminal penalties for unregistered firearms, repeal a gun-offender registry, revoke the federal ban on interstate handgun transfers, restore the right of self-defense in the home, repeal a ban on semiautomatic guns, and require D.C. to issue and honor concealed carry firearms permits for residents and non-residents -- among a litany of other provisions aimed at restoring Second Amendment rights in D.C.The Supreme Court in 2008 struck down the District of Columbia's ban on possession of handguns in the home, but the district still has some of the strictest gun laws in the U.S. on the books. Additionally, D.C. does not ban semiautomatics as a category as mentioned in Paul's bill; it bans assaults weapons.Still, the senator's bill already received a vote. During a debate on legislation to repeal Obamacare, it came up as an amendment, failing 54-45. Republican leadership hasn’t said it will bring the bill up for a vote this week, but by speeding up the process through Rule 14, it gives McConnell the power to call a vote whenever he wants. In the wake of the San Bernardino shooting -- declared an act of terrorism by the president just days later -- lawmakers on Capitol Hill have engaged in charged rhetoric over the event, which rattled the nation. Democrats have questioned Republicans' unwillingness to support even smaller extensions of background checks for firearms. On the House side, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) filed a discharge petition to try to force a vote on whether to consider legislation that prohibits the sale of firearms to individuals on the FBI’s terrorist watch list. First drafted in 2007, the bill was supported by President George W. Bush’s Justice Department. To get an up-or-down vote to bring the bill to the chamber floor, Democrats will need to get a majority of members in the House to sign the petition. Thompson argued on the floor on Monday that there is bipartisan support for the bill, which Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) wrote. “Last week, House Republicans voted three times to protect the ability of suspected terrorists to continue buying guns,” Thompson said. “[This] bill makes sure those on the FBI’s Terrorists Watchlist can’t walk into a gun store, pass a background check, and buy a gun.”"

4,POLITICS,DOJ's Chicago Probe Could Expose How We Fail To Punish Bad Cops,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicago-police-misconduct-doj_us_56672ad6e4b08e945ff1378a,Investigators will likely focus on accountability systems that don't hold police accountable.,2015-12-08,"Demonstrators protest the police shooting death of Laquan McDonald in Chicago on Dec. 7, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56672b2e1600002900e55558.jpeg?cache=ucsRYnFqfT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Justice Department officials hope the broad federal civil rights probe of the Chicago Police Department launched Monday will eventually serve as an example of how other troubled law enforcement agencies can fix problems with investigating and punishing police misconduct. ""There's a lot of places in this country where policing is bad and where intervention is necessary,"" said Jonathan M. Smith, who until earlier this year ran the small Justice Department unit that investigates civil rights violations by police. But the Civil Rights Division unit didn't -- and doesn't -- have the resources to investigate all the law enforcement agencies with problems. So it tries to pick targets that can serve as examples. ""It's important for the division, with limited resources, to make decisions that are strategic,"" Smith said. ""Reading the tea leaves, my guess is the [Chicago] investigation will very much focus on accountability, which is a huge problem in a lot of jurisdictions.""The Chicago investigation follows the November release of a year-old video showing a police officer shooting and killing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Cops' initial accounts of the incident conflicted with the evidence of the video. Those differences and the long delay between the October 2014 shooting and the November 2015 charges against Officer Jason Van Dyke -- paired with data showing widespread issues with how Chicago handles citizen complaints against police -- have raised questions about the mechanisms of accountability. There's a surprising lack of information -- and no national standards -- on how internal affairs offices in law enforcement agencies across the U.S. handle citizen complaints. The Chicago investigation could produce the most comprehensive look at how one of those accountability systems works -- or doesn't.Previous Justice Department investigations have highlighted problems like discriminatory policing aimed at minority communities, systemic failure to handle rape cases and patterns of troublesome pedestrian encounters. The recent investigation in Ferguson, Missouri, spotlighted profit-driven policing and an abusive municipal court system. But like many other recent Justice Department investigations, the Ferguson probe also identified accountability failures, finding the city lacked ""any meaningful system for holding officers accountable"" for violating the law or department policy. In a Cleveland probe, internal investigators admitted that they conducted inquiries with the ""goal of casting the accused officer in the most positive light possible,"" while another federal report found that internal investigators in Newark, New Jersey, ""routinely failed to probe officers' accounts or assess officer credibility.""There is little doubt that Chicago's disciplinary process will now come under Justice Department scrutiny. Recent data collected by the Chicago-based Invisible Institute showed that nearly 96 percent of civilian complaints against the city's police force were not sustained, and roughly 99 percent were not sustained when the complainant was black, though race was not identified in many cases. And Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan has specifically asked the Justice Department to look at excessive force and ""the lack of accountability for such abuse.""At a press conference Monday, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said that looking at ""how a police department not only tracks but resolves and disciplines"" for misuse of force is a ""key element"" in the type of pattern-or-practice investigation that her department is conducting.There's a lot unknown. ""The standards among internal affairs is just so variable that it's hard to get a handle on it,"" policing expert Geoffrey Alpert told The Huffington Post earlier this year. ""There's some really good internal affairs departments around the country; then there's some really bad ones.""Policing expert Samuel Walker had similarly said there's a ""terrible void"" of information about how internal affairs units work and that internal affairs officers often have no specialized training and have been pushed into a role they didn't choose.""Most officers don't want that job. They don't want to have to investigate their fellow officers,"" Walker told HuffPost. ""So in some departments, they more or less get drafted. Now having someone there against his or her will is not a path to professionalism.""Accountability systems are ""at the core"" of understanding what's happening within a police department and fixing problems, said Smith, the former Justice official. The internal affairs process ""should identify not just bad apples, but it should identify broken systems,"" he added.""You're never going to have a perfect police department -- people are going to make mistakes. You're going to make mistakes in hiring; you're going to make mistakes in training. An officer is going to make a mistake on the street,"" Smith said. ""The hallmark of a well-functioning institution is that those mistakes are identified and that there are measures taken to address whatever the problem was that led to the mistake."""

Approximately 100,000 African-Americans and institutions utilized the bank's services. When asked how it felt to see the vision come to fruition, Bryant said that this is ""an acknowledgment of positive contributions, both past and present and most of all, for the future.""""It's a narrative for a new movement,"" he said.Also on HuffPost:"

The officer, Jason Van Dyke, was charged with murder in the shooting of Laquan McDonald on the same day the video was released.On Monday, prosecutors said they would not seek criminal charges in another 2014 police shooting which caused the death of Ronald Johnson III. Prosecutors said Johnson had a gun and was fleeing arrest.The amount of force that can be used by police officers has become a focus of national debate due to a series of high-profile killings of black men at the hands of mostly white police officers in U.S. cities.Evans, who is black, has been the subject of several police misconduct lawsuits, according to local media reports.

Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) bid for the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday, after an overwhelming majority of its members backed the progressive candidate. It is the first time the party has formally backed a candidate in a national election.Over 87 percent of Working Families Party members voted for Sanders, compared to 11.5 percent for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and 1.1 percent for former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. The final endorsement decision was based on both the membership vote and the votes of the group's national advisory board. ""We want to live in a nation that allows all people to live a decent life, no matter what is in their parents' bank account or who is in their family tree,"" Working Families Party National Director Dan Cantor said in a statement. ""But the super-rich have used their economic muscle to buy political muscle, and unless you're one of them, what you think government should do basically doesn't count. That's why we're standing with Bernie Sanders to build the political revolution and make our nation into one where every family can thrive.""""Bernie has devoted his career to helping working families and is gratified by the support of the Working Families Party,"" Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said in a statement. ""Together they will work to take on the billionaire class and change the the rigged economy that is being held up by a corrupt political system.""The Working Families Party, which has chapters in 10 states, elected its first state legislator on its own party line in a Connecticut state Senate special election in February. It has also elected members to city council and school board seats. The party typically endorses Democrats when it doesn't have a member in the race, but sometimes will threaten to challenge Democrats who stray too far from its progressive-populist agenda in primaries.The party's chapters have seen issue advocacy success in pressuring Democrats to pass minimum wage and paid sick leave laws. It has emerged as a leading voice on the left, helping to elect Philadelphia Mayor-elect Jim Kenney and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. (De Blasio endorsed Clinton in October.) The Sanders endorsement is significant because the Working Families Party's fellow progressive groups -- like MoveOn and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee -- have so far held off on endorsing in the Democratic primary, even as most of the country's major labor unions have already backed Clinton.Clinton leads Sanders by nearly 23 points nationally, according to HuffPost Pollster. “Hillary Clinton has wide and deep support from progressives across the country, including elected leaders, grassroots organizers and labor unions,"" Jesse Ferguson, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign, said in a statement later on Tuesday. ""They know her tireless record of fighting for women, children and families and are energized by the bold, progressive policy agenda she has put forward in this campaign.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said the Working Families Party elected its first state legislator on its own party line in a New Jersey state Senate special election.

In a Tuesday report summarizing recent research done on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the White House Council of Economic Advisers says SNAP's monthly benefits reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty and improve lifetime health for children whose parents receive benefits. As for the notion that food stamp benefits diminish people's work effort, the report says ""the existing research suggests that the effects are either modest or negligible.""More than 45 million Americans are enrolled in the program, a number that is only slowly declining after it surged because of the Great Recession.This year, several states have hurried to limit benefits for able-bodied adults without children or jobs. Federal law says childless adults can only have benefits for three months unless they work 20 hours a week, but because of high unemployment, states have been allowed to waive the requirement. Next year, thanks to declining joblessness, the Obama administration will be taking the waivers away. Several Republican governors didn't want to wait, and re-imposed the limit early. “If someone is an adult, who is able to work and they don’t have children, we ask that they be enrolled in one of our job training programs and they go out with our assistance and look for work,"" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said last week after 25 percent of Wisconsin's working-age SNAP recipients saw their benefits discontinued. Walker has repeatedly complained that employers in his state are unable to lure potential workers away from the dole. ""Among working-age adults, some are not working because they are the primary caregivers of young children or a disabled family member, and 22 percent are exempt from work due to disability, but a full 57 percent are either working or are unemployed and looking for work,"" the CEA's report says. The report also says research suggests children in households that receive benefits are 16 percentage points less likely to be obese as adults and 8 percentage points more likely to finish high school.Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, has been overseeing a ""soup-to-nuts"" review of the program with an eye toward somehow nudging more recipients into jobs.""SNAP does not operate in a vacuum in lives of families, and we have heard repeatedly during our hearing series that when SNAP is combined with other programs, it can create a welfare cliff that is difficult to overcome,"" Conaway said in a Tuesday statement, referring to the fact that SNAP recipients lose eligibility for benefits if they earn more money from work. ""Our welfare system should not be a trap that prevents individuals from pursuing work, achieving their potential, and climbing the economic ladder."""

A 53 percent majority of respondents say issues related to terrorism will be ""very important"" when they vote next year, while just 36 percent say the same of gun issues. This is despite the fact that while 29 Americans have been killed in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil in the past decade, 132,349 have been killed by gun violence during the same period.While members of both parties see terrorism as an important issue, the GOP is especially concerned. Eighty-eight percent of Republicans think preventing terrorism is more important than preventing gun violence, while Democrats are about evenly split.The intersection between the two issues isn't lost on Americans: 78 percent say it's ""not very difficult"" or ""not at all difficult"" for terrorists to buy firearms in the country. And concerns about gun violence, if not as prominent, remain high.Eighty-five percent of Americans say gun violence is a ""somewhat serious"" or ""very serious"" problem -- and most think the nation has made little headway in addressing it. Just 3 percent of respondents think the country has improved at preventing gun violence since the December 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. There's also majority support for gun control: 55 percent of those polled think gun laws should be more strict.As previous surveys in the wake of shootings have shown, that's not enough to put such changes into action. Americans have been pessimistic about both the feasibility of passing new gun laws and the effects such laws would actually have, and a minority of voters says stricter guns laws will be ""very important"" in next year's presidential election.Yet the latest poll also suggests that a wave of shootings may have increased the public's desire for action.While 28 percent of respondents say mass shootings are ""just a fact of life in America today,"" 58 percent believe shootings can be stopped -- up 10 points since October's survey in the wake of the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. The percentage who say it's politically possible to pass stricter gun laws now stands at 46 percent, up 7 points since October.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 4-7 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

11,BLACK VOICES,Video Relaunches Investigation Into Death Of Man Held By Chicago Police,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/philip-coleman-chicago-video_us_56670fb1e4b079b2819028f1,"Philip Coleman died in police custody in 2012.

City officials have been under intense scrutiny for police misconduct in recent weeks and have promised to be more transparent about investigations into police wrongdoing.On Monday night, the city released surveillance video from 2012 that showed police officers gathering around detainee Philip Coleman in his cell, striking him with a Taser and then dragging his limp, handcuffed body down the hallway. Full footage of the violent incident can be viewed below. ""I do not see how the manner in which Mr. Coleman was physically treated could possibly be acceptable,"" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement.“While the independent investigation is ongoing we will be doing our own review of our policies and practices surrounding the response to mental health crises,” acting police Superintendent John Escalante said in a statement. Both Emanuel and Escalante indicated that authorities would take a second look at the incident; the mayor said he was unsatisfied with the investigation Chicago's Independent Police Review Authority had performed. ""Something is wrong here -- either the actions of the officers who dragged Mr. Coleman, or the policies of the department,"" Emanuel said. ""I have not received a sufficient answer on either from IPRA’s former leadership, and as a result I do not consider this case to be closed or the investigation into what happened that night to be over.""A Chicago Police Department spokeswoman said on Tuesday the investigation had been considered complete and could not elaborate on how or when it would be reopened. IPRA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Coleman was arrested Dec. 12, 2012, after he allegedly beat his 69-year-old mother and became ""combative"" and spit blood at responding officers, according to the police. At the time, family members said Coleman was acting erratically before the arrest and noted he had no criminal past. Police took Coleman to a local police station, stunning him with a Taser when they tried to take him to court and again when they took him to an area hospital. The 38-year-old University of Chicago graduate may have been struck with a Taser as many as 16 times while in custody, CBS Chicago reported, citing police records. Coleman later died at the hospital. An autopsy ruled his death was accidental -- the result of an allergic reaction to a sedative he was given. Family and friends defended Coleman at the time of the 2012 incident. Percy Coleman told CBS last year that his son suffered a mental breakdown and should have been taken to a hospital, not to jail. City officials released the surveillance footage of Coleman's cell in response to an open records request by CBS Chicago. The tape, which prompted Coleman's family to file a civil rights lawsuit, is just one of several black eyes for Chicago police in recent weeks. Criticism of the department's use of force exploded on Nov. 24, after a court order forced the city to release 2014 dashcam footage showing an officer shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times as he appeared to walk away from the police.Two weeks later, police released dashcam video of another 2014 incident, this time showing police fatally shooting 25-year-old Ronald Johnson, whom officers say was armed. Public outrage over the videos has led Emanuel to fire his hand-picked police chief, Garry McCarthy. The department's chief of detectives, Constantine Andrews, has resigned and the chief of IPRA, Scott Ando, was ousted. The Justice Department has also opened a civil rights investigation into the department.Also on HuffPost: "

General manager Sam Hinkie remains with the team, but all indications seem to imply that Colangelo will try his hardest to prevent Hinkie from continuing to tank the team into oblivion.Philly's continued willingness to lose games in the hopes of obtaining a high draft lottery pick was causing so much anger that the NBA reportedly decided to intervene by forming a partnership between 76ers owner Joshua Harris and Colangelo, according to ESPN's Brian Windhorst.Their new chairman of basketball operations was on hand as the 76ers hit a new low Monday night. Philly lost at home 119-68 to the San Antonio Spurs, even though Spurs coach Gregg Popovich rested Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard and Manu Ginobili. That whopping 51-point victory was the largest margin in San Antonio's history.With Monday's loss, Philadelphia stands at 1-21. The team started the season 0-18, and their only win of the season marked the end of a record-setting 28-game losing streak that dated back to last season.Since the 76ers hired Sam Hinkie as their general manager in May 2013, the team's record had been 38-148, a winning percentage of about 26 percent. This stretch includes the aforementioned 28-game losing streak as well as a 26-game streak during the 2013-2014 season, the second longest losing streak of all time.After two and a quarter seasons of losing basketball, it has become more evident than ever to many higher-ups in the NBA that whatever is going on in Philly is not working for the league, and perhaps not even for the 76ers. To say Philadelphia has been disastrous would be an understatement. In fact, the franchise appears to regressing from their already-horrendous state last season. The roster is still filled with no-name role players, a staple of the Hinkie area, and the team has failed to make good on Hinkie's shameless attempt to lose games in order to obtain a top-10 talent, the sort of player that can turn a losing team into a major contender.At this point, the organization is so deep into the Sam Hinkie experiment that they couldn't simply jump ship and boot him without alarming the fans who still want to #TrustTheProcess, the slogan that embodied the tanktastic Sixers. After more than two dreadful seasons, the front office is now forking over money to essentially pay for a co-GM -- an expensive way to say they're sorry. This way, Philly's front office did what they could do without explicitly saying they were completely wrong for giving Hinkie the keys to the car -- a car they watched Hinkie crash and burn to the ground, with owner Joshua Harris left to hope the team's new hire can extinguish this mess.The question is, what can Colangelo possibly do to stop this franchise from being the flaming wreck they are? Either way, it appears clear that the 76ers' patience, not to mention the league's, is wearing thin. Also on HuffPost:"
13,SPORTS,ESPN Analyst Blames 'Liberal Media' For 'War On Football',Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/danny-kanell-liberal-media-war-on-football_us_5666f604e4b079b281900679,"""War on Christmas,"" meet ""war on football.""",2015-12-08,ESPN analyst Danny Kanell when he was a quarterback for the NFL's Denver Broncos in 2003.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56670d651600002800e554e8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The New York Times published an editorial on Monday that questioned whether parents should allow kids to play football, given increased awareness about the long-term dangers the sport may pose to the brain.To former NFL quarterback Danny Kanell, who now works as an analyst for ESPN, that editorial represents an effort by the ""liberal media"" to wage a ""war on football.""The author of the editorial, however, was not a member of the so-called ""liberal media,"" but rather Dr. Bennet Omalu, the forensic pathologist who first discovered the degenerative brain known as disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, in the brain of former NFL star Mike Webster.Omalu, the subject of the upcoming movie ""Concussion"" starring Will Smith, has continued studying CTE -- as have other researchers, like those at Boston University who have found the disease in the brains of 87 of the 91 deceased former NFL players they have studied. There are important caveats about sample size and selection in that research, as the scientists themselves have warned, but it has helped paint a clearer picture about the risks that football may pose.Further studies have highlighted the potential risk of repeated hits to the head to young players or those who began playing football at younger ages. Increased attention to the number of high school students killed while playing football, which has remained constant for 35 years, has raised further questions, too. Omalu is not the only doctor to question whether children should play football: Boston University's Dr. Robert Cantu, another leading brain scientist, has suggested that kids shouldn't play tackle football until after age 14, and other doctors have made similar arguments. Not all scientists agree with Omalu and Cantu, but their positions are part of the ongoing discussion about whether children should play sports that may pose long-term dangers to their brains. Those opinions would seem worthy of consideration, especially because the brain, as Omalu wrote on Monday, can't heal itself after all types of injuries.There are still unanswered questions about the risks that football and other contact sports like hockey and soccer pose to the long-term health of players at every level. It's not clear how likely it is that athletes who play contact sports will suffer long-term brain damage, or how and whether those risks can be mitigated. Scientists have called for more research, particularly on young athletes.But what Kanell sees as a ""war on football"" is not a product of some vast media conspiracy to take down America's most popular sport. Rather, the scrutiny football and other sports are facing is a result of scientific research that attempts to understand and explain problems that have afflicted so many athletes, and to answer the questions that not just reporters, but former players themselves, have raised about these sports.Also on HuffPost: "
