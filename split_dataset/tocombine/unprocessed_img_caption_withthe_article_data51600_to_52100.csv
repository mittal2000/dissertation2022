0,POLITICS,Supreme Court About To Enter Legal Fight Over Trans Rights And Bathroom Access,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/transgender-bathroom_us_57869ceee4b0867123df7887,It will be the first time the high court has squarely addressed these issues.,2016-07-14,"Gavin Grimm on his front porch during an interview at his home in Gloucester, Va. His case could determine whether federal anti-discrimination law is meant to cover gender identity.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The controversy over the rights of transgender students and bathroom access at their local schools has reached the Supreme Court.The dispute arrived at the justices’ doorstep on Wednesday in the form of an emergency application by the Gloucester County School Board in Virginia, which was ordered by a federal judge to accommodate a trans high school student who was denied access to a bathroom that aligns with his gender identity.The long-running fight of Gavin Grimm with Gloucester school authorities came to a head in April, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit sided with him and ruled that federal anti-discrimination law includes protections for trans individuals.That ruling, which a judge enforced in late June, was a high-water mark for transgender rights because it gave “controlling weight” to the Obama administration’s interpretation of Title IX, the law that bars federally funded schools from discriminating against students on account of race, sex and other protected categories.Congress didn’t originally write the “sex” provision in the law to cover gender identity, but a number of appeals courts and the federal government have determined that it’s also covered ― prompting the Department of Education to issue guidance for states and localities to make arrangements for trans students or else risk losing federal funding. In turn, that same guidance has sparked a flurry of lawsuits by and against the federal government in North Carolina, Texas and Nebraska, each raising related legal issues.Grimm’s school district mentions these recent developments in its petition to the Supreme Court to bolster its argument that the issue is of “nationwide importance” and thus merits intervention.But the justices won’t be addressing the merits of these claims head-on. Instead, they’ll simply determine whether the school board should be given a temporary reprieve from accommodating Grimm while it pursues a formal appeal before the justices ― a process that could take months.In court papers, lawyers for the Gloucester County School Board say the Grimm case represents “one of the most extreme examples of judicial deference to an administrative agency this Court will ever see,” and that it may lead to “irreparable harm to the Board, to the school system, and to the legitimate privacy expectations of the district’s schoolchildren and parents alike.”The board’s central argument is that the Supreme Court should revisit a prior decision that gave federal agencies broad leeway to interpret their own regulations ― a mechanism the Obama administration is said to be exploiting in the trans bathroom battles across the country.As applied in the Grimm case, this precedent allows the Department of Education to push its “Title IX interpretation on every school district in the Nation and, indeed, to extend that interpretation beyond restrooms to locker rooms, showers, single-sex classes, housing, and overnight accommodations,” the board’s lawyers wrote. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Grimm, is expected to oppose Wednesday’s request by the Gloucester County School Board.The request was addressed to Chief Justice John Roberts, who covers emergency applications from Virginia. He could act on the petition on his own or forward it to the full court for adjudication.But even if the Supreme Court turns away Grimm’s school district at this early stage, the ACLU said, the order allowing Grimm to use a bathroom that comports with his gender identity wouldn’t pose a big burden.“The only thing this injunction does is let Gavin use the boys’ restroom,” Joshua Block, Grimm’s attorney at the ACLU, told The Washington Post. “The notion that simply allowing one boy to use the restroom during his senior year of high school would cause the sky to fall is impossible to take seriously.”"

Orlando Cruz, who came out in 2012, will face off against Alejandro “Alex’’ Valdez, three days after the one-month anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting that left 49 people dead and 53 more injured, the Orlando Sentinel reports. The July 15 fight will take place in Kissimmee, Florida, roughly 30 minutes from the nightclub. The boxer, 35, will be a part of a 49-bell salute to each of the Pulse victims, and is set to wear a pair of specially-designed trunks as a tribute. “It is a surprise,” he said of the design in a July 9 interview with the Sentinel. Cruz, who lives in Puerto Rico with his husband, told BuzzFeed that he was close friends with Franky Jimmy Dejesus Velazquez, one of the Pulse shooting victims. “It really affected me and made me angry to see that among so many dead was my close friend,” he told BuzzFeed. “Gay people have rights just like everybody else and everyone needs to realize that we deserve to live openly and happy.”On Tuesday, Cruz visited the memorial that has been erected outside of Pulse. Photos of the boxer kneeling beside the makeshift shrine were posted on Twitter. After his visit to Pulse on Tuesday, Cruz announced that he was helping to launch a Latino voting awareness campaign in Florida, according to BuzzFeed. The boxer has said he felt both sad and angry in the days after the shooting. “I am very angry because people are homophobic, so they attacked my community,” he told the Sentinel. “They attacked me.”"

Mike Pence is reportedly Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577ebedc1a00002700dd017c.jpeg?ops=crop_0_513_3480_1782%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has settled on Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate, according to multiple reports, including one in the governor’s local paper.A formal announcement is expected to come on Friday in New York City. Though several outlets reported that it was a done deal, The New York Times on Thursday afternoon reported only that there were strong signals Pence was being tapped for the gig. Trump’s communication office has denied that a decision has been made.The Indianapolis Star reported Pence dropped his re-election bid for governor in order to pursue the vice presidency. His departure from that race means the Indiana Republican State Committee will choose the GOP candidate for governor for the first time in state history.Pence, 57, would bring nearly four years of executive experience to the ticket and could help shore up Trump’s credibility among establishment holdouts within the GOP. The governor also seems to have met Trump’s stated preference of a running mate who can ably navigate the corridors of power in Washington ― Pence previously served 12 years in the House of Representatives, including two years as chairman of the House Republican Conference.Pence, who twice considered running for president, is well regarded by conservatives and evangelicals around the country, earning plaudits recently from the likes of Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Jeff Roe, former presidential campaign manager to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).“I will admit that I am a Mike Pence fan. He is so well-rounded, served as a governor and I think he’s a great conservative. So I don’t think he could go wrong,” Ernst told Politico recently, after indicating she was not interested in the position herself.Oregon GOP delegate Kevin Hoar argued Pence could help Trump with conservatives and the Tea Party wing of the party.“I think he’s somebody who would bring along the base of the party, particularly people who might not have been the biggest Trump fans,” Hoar told HuffPost outside of an RNC rules committee hearing in Cleveland. “I think this would bring a lot of [Texas Sen. Ted] Cruz’s supporters. And the other thing is that it will bring someone who has a lot of credible experience in government. That’s something Donald Trump knows he lacks.”Idaho GOP delegate Steve Yates, who previously advised the Bush-Cheney 2000 campaign, said Pence would be a “reassuring” choice among his fellow delegates. He downplayed disagreement between the two men on issues such as trade and Trump’s Muslim ban.“There is no mistaking who’s the top of the ticket, who’s running mate, who’s the president, who’s the vice president,” Yates told HuffPost outside of an RNC rules committee hearing in Cleveland. “I don’t think it’s really actually much of an issue. In fact, it’s very traditional that you have a running mate that may have had a difference in opinion or policy over the years. But you join a ticket to do to things you agree on together. So, if Mr. Trump is comfortable with Pence, sounds like a good deal.”A source who spoke with Trump on Tuesday said he had settled on Pence by then, with the belief that Pence would provide the steadiness needed, and that he would be able to handle the policy substance that is not Trump’s strength. Trump added that he was impressed with the way Pence has run Indiana, and that picking him would lock down the state’s electoral votes. Last year, Pence ignited a national controversy by signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, legislation that sought to legalize discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. After severe backlash from civic and business leaders, however, he was forced amend the measure ensuring protections for sexual orientation and gender identity.Before Trump even made his pick, he had at least one detractor in prominent conservative radio host and former Red State editor Erick Erickson, who chided Pence on Twitter.By signing on with the Trump campaign, Pence would disqualify himself from running for re-election as governor. Indiana law bars him from appearing on the ballot as both a vice presidential and gubernatorial candidate.Ryan Grim contributed reporting.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Even my Jews would say Merry Christmas,’” she explained. “’New York City, there are a lot of Jews, and they would even say Merry Christmas. Why can’t we even say Merry Christmas anymore?’” The comments were posted online by Right Wing Watch. Bachmann also said Trump had “1950s sensibilities” and “1950s common sense,” and warned that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton would bring “certain destruction” and “catastrophic decline” and a “godless United States that will walk into certain catastrophe.” (h/t Raw Story)Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Mike Pence has a long record of opposing women's reproductive rights.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5787dfbd1a00002700dd1663.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump recently offered some words of praise for Planned Parenthood, confusing some about where he stands on women’s reproductive rights. But the presumptive GOP presidential nominee appears to have put those questions to rest by selecting as his running mate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who has led the GOP’s war on Planned Parenthood, birth control access and abortion rights for more than five years. When Republicans took over the House of Representatives in 2011, then-Rep. Pence authored the first bill to strip all federal money from Planned Parenthood. He then threatened to shut down the federal government over Planned Parenthood funding in an interview on MSNBC.Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told Politico at the time that she had never seen a legislator go after the organization with as much intensity as Pence. “He’s the only one I know of who has been so completely obsessed with Planned Parenthood,” she said. “This just seems to be an enormous focus of his.”“A Trump-Pence ticket should send a shiver down the spine of women in this country,” the group said in a statement Thursday. “Donald Trump just sent a message to the women of America: your health and your lives are not important.”Also in 2011, Pence cosponsored the Ultrasound Informed Consent Act, a bill that would have required abortion providers to perform an ultrasound on a woman seeking abortion, regardless of whether it was medically necessary, and then describe the embryo in detail to her. He also cosponsored a bill that would have essentially redefined rape, prohibiting federal funds from paying for abortion except in cases of “forcible rape,” and a bill that would allow hospitals to deny abortions to pregnant women who would die without the care. Since Pence became governor of Indiana in 2013, he has signed multiple anti-abortion bills into law, including a measure that prohibits private insurance providers from offering abortion coverage. Under his leadership in 2015, Indiana experienced a devastating HIV outbreak, which was exacerbated by the closure of a Planned Parenthood clinic that was the only HIV testing center in the county. The clinic had closed due to Pence’s cuts to Planned Parenthood’s funding. in March, Pence signed one of the worst anti-abortion omnibus bills in the country into law. Among other things, it requires doctors to offer women the “remains” of the fetus after an abortion. Indiana women were so frustrated with Pence’s apparent preoccupation with their reproductive organs this year that they started a “Periods for Pence” campaign, giving him details of their menstrual cycles. One woman even invited Pence to her gynecologist appointment.Not surprisingly, anti-abortion advocates cheered the news of Trump’s likely pick on Thursday.“Mr. Trump’s selection of Gov. Mike Pence is an affirmation of the pro-life commitments he’s made and will rally the pro-life grassroots,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List. Women’s rights advocates decried the choice.“Pence has a rich history of marginalizing women as a politician, the same way Donald Trump has throughout his career and this campaign,” said Marcy Stech, a spokesperson for the pro-choice PAC EMILY’s List. “Together, they are a perfect storm of classic, out of touch, GOP extremism. For the very few women still not convinced that Trump isn’t a threat to women, Gov. Pence should do it—these men are not to be trusted.” "

Baker and Jessica ToonkelJuly 13 (Reuters) - Chinese real estate and entertainment conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group has held talks with Viacom Inc about acquiring a minority stake in its Paramount Pictures unit, according to two people familiar with the situation.Wanda’s interest adds new urgency to deliberations over Paramount’s future, which has become the flashpoint of a bitter row between Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman and the company’s controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone. Wanda, which bought production company Legendary Entertainment in January, has been trying to expand its U.S. movie business.Redstone has so far opposed the sale, which is not possible without his consent. Other parties besides Wanda have also expressed an interest in Paramount, and there is no certainty any deal will be reached, the people said this week.The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. Viacom declined to comment, while Wanda did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Earlier this year, Wanda invested in Paramount’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” sequel.If the two parties did agree to a deal, it would likely become the next flashpoint in the long-running battle for control of Sumner Redstone’s $40 billion media empire.The Paramount deal has been championed by Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman, who is seeking to sell a 49 percent stake in the movie studio but opposed by 93-year-old Redstone, who owns 80 percent of Viacom and CBS Corp.It is not clear that Redstone and his daughter Shari Redstone would agree to a deal if one was struck.Shari Redstone spokeswoman Nancy Sterling and Sumner Redstone spokesman Mike Lawrence declined to comment.Redstone, supported by his daughter, is waging a two-pronged legal battle with Dauman and other Viacom directors, which originated with a disagreement over the proposed sale of a stake inParamount.In May, Redstone removed Dauman and another Viacom board member, George Abrams, from the seven-person Sumner M Redstone National Amusements Inc Trust, which will determine the fate of Redstone’s holdings, and hence the future of Viacom and CBS, after Redstone dies or is incapacitated.Paramount has special resonance for Redstone, who fought long and hard to acquire the movie studio from Barry Diller in 1994.Redstone’s move to throw Dauman and Abrams off his trust is the subject of a court case in Massachusetts.In June, Redstone moved to take Dauman and four other directors off the board of Viacom, through his privately held movie theater company National Amusements Inc, which holds 80 percent of voting shares of Viacom as well as CBS. A court in Delaware is considering whether that move was legal.Dauman is contesting both actions, arguing that Redstone is not mentally competent to make decisions.Throughout the legal face-off, Dauman has said Viacom has been working on the Paramountstake sale, even after National Amusements changed its bylaws to require unanimous approval from Viacom’s board for any deal related to Paramount. At the time, National Amusements said it was “not opposed to a transaction that would unlock value at Paramount.”Dauman has said the divestiture would unlock value of $10 or more per Viacom share and that he would use the proceeds from a sale to pay off debt and for strategic development, particularly overseas.

That’s partly why the dangers of drowsy driving are easy to ignore until you get hurt, or someone close to you does. No one knows this better than Phil Konstantin, a retired California highway patrolman, whose wife died after falling asleep at the wheel in 1999. Even though he was more aware of fatigued driving than most people, since his job involved traffic safety, her death was a huge wake-up call. In the 17 years since she died, he has worked tirelessly to raise awareness about the issue. He was one of the country’s earliest activists about a then-niche cause, and pushed for the state of California to enact an annual Drowsy Driving Awareness Day, which was established in April 2005.Konstantin says drowsy driving is dangerous because people just don’t realize it can affect them. “The word I like to use is ‘insidious.’ It can sneak up on people,” Konstantin told The Huffington Post. “In fact, it even happened to me! Around 1972, I grazed the center divider of a freeway after dozing off, and luckily, I woke up and went on with my day. But it could have been so much worse.”Konstantin’s drowsy driving advocacy is only his latest role. He is a Zelig-like figure who was a computer engineer at NASA during the Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 moon landings, a television talk show host and an author before he became a highway patrolman. Today, he is, by his own admission, “semi-retired” and is spending a year road-tripping through the U.S. ― taking great pains, of course, to drive safely and alertly.He told HuffPost that he’s pleased to see the progress that groups like the National Sleep Foundation and AAA have made in raising awareness around drowsy driving. Konstantin himself has recorded several video PSAs and continues to speak about it when called on.“Certainly in the last five to ten years, more people are aware about this issue than ever before. But they still don’t necessarily think it can happen to them,” Konstantin said. He points to the fact that the number of drowsy driving accidents has generally increased in recent years as evidence of this.“What’s ridiculous is that many law enforcement agencies still don’t note drowsiness as an official cause in their traffic reports,” he said. To date, only two states, New Jersey and Arkansas, even have laws in the books about fatigued driving.One thing he is adamant about is that there is “no workaround” when it comes to drowsy driving.“You just have to get off the road,” he said. “This is one of the few problems in the world that can be cured very simply. Just don’t drive if you’re tired. Coffee isn’t a good cure. Exercise is preventative, but obviously not something you can do in the car. Music won’t keep you awake.”Konstantin’s work is deeply informed by the circumstances of his wife’s death. Her car crash in Texas, en route from California to Florida, happened just a few miles from a highway rest area.“My job with the California Highway Patrol was literally to prevent dangerous driving incidents, and this happened to someone so close to me,” he said. “It was a huge wake-up call. I hope what I’m doing helps put a human face on this for someone before it’s too late.”"

Around 1972, I grazed the center divider of a freeway after dozing off, and luckily, I woke up and went on with my day. But it could have been so much worse.”Konstantin’s drowsy driving advocacy is only his latest role. He is a Zelig-like figure who was a computer engineer at NASA during the Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 moon landings, a television talk show host and an author before he became a highway patrolman. Today, he is, by his own admission, “semi-retired” and is spending a year road-tripping through the U.S. ― taking great pains, of course, to drive safely and alertly.He told HuffPost that he’s pleased to see the progress that groups like the National Sleep Foundation and AAA have made in raising awareness around drowsy driving. Konstantin himself has recorded several video PSAs and continues to speak about it when called on.“Certainly in the last five to ten years, more people are aware about this issue than ever before. But they still don’t necessarily think it can happen to them,” Konstantin said. He points to the fact that the number of drowsy driving accidents has generally increased in recent years as evidence of this.“What’s ridiculous is that many law enforcement agencies still don’t note drowsiness as an official cause in their traffic reports,” he said. To date, only two states, New Jersey and Arkansas, even have laws in the books about fatigued driving.One thing he is adamant about is that there is “no workaround” when it comes to drowsy driving.“You just have to get off the road,” he said. “This is one of the few problems in the world that can be cured very simply. Just don’t drive if you’re tired. Coffee isn’t a good cure. Exercise is preventative, but obviously not something you can do in the car. Music won’t keep you awake.”Konstantin’s work is deeply informed by the circumstances of his wife’s death. Her car crash in Texas, en route from California to Florida, happened just a few miles from a highway rest area.“My job with the California Highway Patrol was literally to prevent dangerous driving incidents, and this happened to someone so close to me,” he said. “It was a huge wake-up call. I hope what I’m doing helps put a human face on this for someone before it’s too late.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578670c31a000023006fa324.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The NBA offseason has been filled with record-breaking contracts and eye-boggling free agency signings that would even make Wall Street CEOs blush.But when Kenny “The Jet” Smith, who helps host TNT’s “Inside The NBA” along with Shaquille O’Neal, Charles Barkley, and Ernie Johnson, sees big money being handed over to NBA players, he sees something else, too: big opportunity.During a speech he gave Monday on Periscope, the former NBA player called for NBA players to use 10 percent of their annual salaries to assist their communities ― and have their sponsors match that money. In an interview with The Huffington Post, Smith described it as a “civil duty” among increasingly wealthy NBA players to do more to help those less fortunate than them.“When you’re making 30 million per year, your communities can live well, can change the landscape of how the whole community is affected,” he told The Huffington Post. “I think that unfortunately it’s now their civil duty to do that.”Professional athletes have long donated money to causes that they care about, but Smith believes that the ballooning size of contracts means current NBA players have an ability to make a change that past players could not. The NBA announced on July 2 that the salary cap would be set at $94.143 million for the 2016-17 season, which would mark a jump of over $24 million from the $70 million salary cap in the 2014-2015 season. The increase in cap space allowed players like James Harden and Kevin Durant to sign contracts starting at an annual rate of nearly $30 million next season. Smith believes the increased contract money allows players to have the ability to make a nationwide impact. “I think that guys have done it in the past, but have not been able to make a significant impact,” he said. “I made $3 million a year as a player. Ten percent of my salary doesn’t make an impact around the country or in my neighborhood.” Though he couldn’t make the impact he wanted to as a player in the ‘80s and ‘90s, for the past three years, Smith as worked in partnership with the National Urban League, Coors Light for the Full Court Refresh Program to invest in refurbishing basketball courts around the country. As part of their campaign, $1 will be donated each time the hashtags #fullcourtrefresh and #over21 are used."

As we leave the European Union we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world, and we will make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us,” she said outside 10 Downing Street, vacated hours earlier by David Cameron.Cameron stepped down after Britons rejected his entreaties to stay in the EU, a decision that has set back European efforts to forge greater unity and created huge uncertainty in Britain and across the 28-nation bloc.Just over an hour after entering her new office, May began naming ministers, appointing the steady and experienced foreign minister Philip Hammond to take charge of the finance ministry.

She will also attempt to unite a fractured nation in which many, on the evidence of the referendum, feel angry with the political elite and left behind by the forces of globalization.In comments addressed to ordinary Britons, she spoke of the ‘burning injustice’ suffered by large sections of society: poor people facing shorter life expectancy; blacks treated more harshly by the criminal justice system; women earning less than men; the mentally ill; and young people struggling to buy homes.Acknowledging the struggles faced by many people, May declared: “The government I lead will be driven not be the interests of the privileged few, but by yours.

14,HEALTHY LIVING,Skin Cancer Risk For Freckly Red-Heads Equivalent To 21 Years In Sun,"Kate Kelland, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/skin-cancer-risk-for-freckly-red-heads-equivalent-to-21-years-in-sun_us_57865218e4b03fc3ee4eaf8c,Redheads need to be especially diligent about staying out of the sun.,2016-07-13,Actress Michelle Monaghan had a cancerous mole removed from the back of her leg after her husband urged her to get the mole checked out by a doctor.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578653d21a00002700dd11f4.jpeg?cache=iEU9ijfqIb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Having genes that give you red hair, pale skin and freckles increases your risk of developing skin cancer as much as an extra 21 years’ exposure to the sun, researchers said on Tuesday.Their study found gene variants that produce red hair and freckly, fair skin were linked to a higher number of mutations that lead to skin cancers. The researchers said even people with one copy of the crucial MC1R gene - who may be fair-skinned but not have red hair - have a higher risk.“It has been known for a while that a person with red hair has an increased likelihood of developing skin cancer, but this is the first time that the gene has been proven to be associated with skin cancers with more mutations,” said David Adams, who co-led the study at Britain’s Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.“Unexpectedly, we also showed that people with only a single copy of the gene variant still have a much higher number of tumor mutations than the rest of the population.”Redheads make up between 1 and 2 percent of the world’s population, but about 6 percent in Britain. They have two copies of a variant of the MC1R gene which affects the type of melanin pigment they produce, leading to red hair, freckles, pale skin and a strong tendency to burn in the sun. Exposure to ultraviolet light from either the sun or sunbeds causes damage to DNA and scientists think the type of skin pigment linked to redheads may allow more UV to reach the DNA. In this latest study, the researchers found that while this may be one factor in the damage, there are also others linked to the crucial MC1R gene.The team, whose work was published in the journal Nature Communications, analyzed data from of tumor DNA sequences collected from more than 400 people with cancer. They found an average of 42 percent more sun-associated mutations in tumors from people carrying the MC1R gene variant.The research showed the MC1R gene variation not only increased the number of spontaneous mutations caused by sunlight, but also raised the level of other mutations in the tumors.This suggests, the researchers said, that there are biological processes in the way cancer develops in people with MC1R variation that are not only related to ultraviolet light.“This ... explains why red-haired people have to be so careful about covering up in strong sun,” said Julie Sharp of the charity Cancer Research UK, which co-funded the research.“It also underlines that it isn’t just people with red hair who need to protect themselves from too much sun.”(Reporting by Kate Kelland; editing by Andrew Roche)"
15,POLITICS,Donald Trump Heads Into The Convention With Barely Any Campaign At All,Sam Stein and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-campaign-offices_us_57866c42e4b03fc3ee4ed0be,Many of the numbers listed for his state offices don't even work.,2016-07-13,Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump doesn't have physical offices yet in several states.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57866cc31b00002700f6db4c.jpeg?cache=SPaDAkRvzt&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As he heads for the Republican convention in Cleveland next week, Donald Trump’s campaign infrastructure remains severely underdeveloped. In some places it appears to be non-existent.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has been public about his belief that he can navigate his way to electoral victory on thin budgets and limited physical presence. But the degree to which his campaign is barebones may not be fully appreciated.The Huffington Post attempted to call the contact phone numbers for the Trump campaign in all 50 states. A few of the state operations had no websites or no numbers listed. Many of the other numbers didn’t work. When we left voicemails, we didn’t get callbacks.On only six occasions did someone actually answer the phone. And in several of those instances, the person who picked up explained that a physical office would be opened up only after the convention.“I’m sure the headquarters will open soon,” said the individual who answered Trump’s Georgia number.“We don’t have them open yet,” said his Michigan staffer. “We are getting them ready.”An official in South Carolina said that the Trump campaign pulled out of the state after the primary but that they were expecting to re-open following the convention.Individuals in New Hampshire and Washington said they did have at least one office in the state. In the latter, there was just one, with a Seattle office coming soon.An official in Fayetteville, North Carolina, said that the campaign had closed down their headquarters after the primary but that an office was open in the Charlotte area.The paucity of live voices on the other end of the phone line doesn’t mean that Trump has functioning operations in just those few states. In Ohio, a news report noted that Trump has a physical office. In California, it has been reported that one is coming shortly. In Florida, there is a Trump office as well, though it will apparently close during the convention. In Virginia, there may not be an office but there are active volunteers ― as is the case in other states like Wisconsin.But if you’re a Trump supporter wanting to find a place to work phone banks, pick up some yard signs or otherwise volunteer to help, the process isn’t easy.The campaign has a distinct website for nearly every state except, for some reason, Iowa, North Dakota and Wyoming. They’re largely similar: information on where to vote in the now-past primary or caucus, a “get out the vote” video featuring Ivanka Trump, a form to sign up to volunteer, and a number to call for help. But in many states, the phone numbers don’t function at all, raising the question of why they’re listed in the first place.The phone numbers listed for Alabama, Arizona, California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia all had a recording identifying itself as the Trump campaign headquarters. But many of them went straight to voicemail. The Nevada and Florida numbers didn’t have an outgoing message, other than to inform callers that the mailbox was full.Fourteen of the state websites list numbers for the Trump headquarters in New York City ― 15, if you count the New York state website ― rather than for campaign offices within the state. There are no numbers listed on the websites for Massachusetts or Texas.Then there are the states where you get an error message if you dial in. Arkansas and Oklahoma share a phone number, but it’s not in service. There’s an “application error” for Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Nebraska, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin. An automated voice informs callers to the Connecticut and Pennsylvania offices that the customer they are attempting to reach has not set up a voicemail and suggests they try again later.The Trump campaign headquarters did not return a request for comment.In the past, the campaign has downplayed the need for a brick-and-mortar operation, arguing that large rallies and free media could supplement a lack of on-the-ground effort. During the primary, Trump did routinely set up offices in states with upcoming elections, but many of them closed once the vote was over.The Republican National Committee is trying to help Trump catch up on this front. While officials there likewise did not return a request for comment, top GOP aides have expressed confidence in earlier conversations that they can run a competitive ground game in the fall. Still, they start from a serious deficit. On Monday, the Associated Press reported that the RNC was lagging in terms of staffing in critical battleground states. While they were hoping for 220 paid staff in Ohio, for example, they had around 50 in May.The Clinton campaign, for its part, doesn’t make life easy for those who want to find a physical campaign office nearby. The state websites don’t include addresses or phone numbers, just forms that people can fill out to contact individuals in specific states.But the Clinton presence is certainly more noticeable than Trump’s. According to a Clinton aide, the campaign currently has more than 100 offices in 14 states. All told, it had staff in 45 states.Local press reports identify 11 of the states where Clinton has opened campaign headquarters: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Following the deaths of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile and five Dallas police officers, Anthony is now suggesting that he and his fellow basketball players take a stand on the biggest sports stage in the world: the Olympics.In a blog post published on The Guardian on Wednesday, Anthony suggested, albeit rather coyly, that he wants his teammates on the U.S. Olympics basketball team to do something in Rio de Janeiro that will help effect change. “For me, I do feel like this is a platform where we should — we as athletes, we as Americans — use it for something,” he continued. “Whether we make a statement out there or send a message, we can show the world that we’re united. Whatever way we want to do it, this is a chance to do something meaningful before an audience of billions. I don’t know what that something is yet, but we still have time to figure it out.”The suggestion comes less than a week after Anthony posted an Instagram in which he said, “I’m calling for all my fellow ATHLETES to step up and take charge.”For more Olympic coverage:Here Are The 5 Superhumans Who Just Made The U.S. Olympic Gymnastics Team"

At the time, Stapleton was the lead singer for the bluegrass group The SteelDrivers. Adele was famous (though not as famous as she is now) and was covering the band’s song “If It Hadn’t Been For Love” while touring for her album “19.” “The head of Rounder Records, the label that we were on at the time, sent me an email and he said, ‘Hey man, Adele is covering ‘If It Hadn’t Been For Love,’ you should try to get your publishing company to try and get it on the record,” Stapleton told The Huffington Post during a recent phone interview. “I was like, ‘That’s great, Who’s Adele?’” Stapleton said, laughing. “What a treat, what a great singer and artist to have cover one of your songs.” According to an interview with The SteelDrivers’ Mike Henderson, the U.K. songstress allegedly first heard the song by chance when she was taking a smoke break on her tour bus. “She and the driver got to talking ... He asked, ‘Do you like bluegrass?’ And she goes, ‘Well, I don’t know, I haven’t really heard a lot of it,’” Henderson said in a 2015 interview with Nashville Scene. “And he played The SteelDrivers record for her, and she fell in love with that song, and had her band learn it, and they started doing it.” Adele was so enamored with the song, she ended up putting it on the U.K. release of her second studio album, “21.” No word as to whether or not we’ll hear a duo from the two superstars on Stapleton’s next album.The country singer is currently on tour, but don’t expect new music from him anytime soon. Stapleton told HuffPost that he doesn’t really write on the road. He also remained mum on future collaborations with his pal Justin Timberlake, who’s reportedly making a country album. Stapleton recently found time in his busy schedule to go play for the troops in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, over the 4th of July weekend. The singer presented $1 million check to Folds of Honor, a foundation that provides military scholarships, on behalf of Budweiser. “It was a good time with the troops,” Stapleton said. “What a great thing we get to do.” The Huffington Post receives a percentage from the purchase of tickets bought via a link on this page."

Miley Cyrus nailed her gender-bending rendition of “I’m Your Man” and “I’m a Woman” on the show’s opening episode, while Rudolph brought the laughs by singing an epic “vajingle” about tampons and impersonating Oprah’s love for bread on later episodes. On Tuesday night’s episode of the show, Rudolf teamed up with actress Emma Stone for a soothing, slowed-down version of Robyn’s “Call Your Girlfriend.” With the help of a few empty butter tubs, the two singing together sounded smooth like butter. “I saw this thing on YouTube a couple years ago of these three girls in their kitchen in Sweden singing a song, playing butter tubs just like these.

19,POLITICS,This May Be The Last We See Of Kim Davis' Legal Troubles,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-davis-contempt-appeal_us_577d15e5e4b04164641149ba,An appeals court would not throw out the contempt order that put Davis in jail for refusing to issue marriage licenses.,2016-07-13,"Rowan County clerk Kim Davis is shown in this booking photo in Grayson, Kentucky, on Sept. 3, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577d161e1900002400219913.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A ruling on Wednesday closes the door on Kentucky clerk Kim Davis’ yearlong campaign against marrying gay couples in her county.An appeals court declined a request from Davis to vacate an order that found her in contempt ― after she refused last summer to issue marriage licenses to all couples in Rowan County, in defiance of the landmark Supreme Court decision recognizing gay couples’ constitutional right to marry.Following the ruling, Davis, a devout Christian, instituted a blanket “no license policy” for anyone wishing to marry in the county, contending that signing her name to the documents violated her religious beliefs.In response, a number of couples sued Davis in federal court, which ordered her to issue marriage licenses. But she defied the court’s order, which landed her in jail for days and led to a lengthy appeals battle which she lost at every step of the way.In this final round of appeals, Davis sought to dismiss the matter altogether, in light of a new Kentucky law that no longer requires county clerks to sign their names to marriage licenses. Davis’ lawyers argued this meant her case was “moot” because the new legislation gave her the religious accommodation she sought from the beginning.In a two-page order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit agreed to dismiss the case, but specifically declined to throw out the contempt order against Davis because her lawyers didn’t meet the necessary legal requirements.In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union, part of the legal team that represented the couples, praised the court’s move to leave the contempt order in place.“We’re pleased that the appeals court kept that decision on the books: It will serve as a reminder to other government officials that placing their personal views ahead of the Constitution and the rule of law is not acceptable,” said Ria Tabacco Mar, an attorney with the ACLU’s LGBT Project.Curiously, Davis’ legal team also claimed victory, noting the ruling “removes the cloud” that the initial contempt order placed on Davis’ record and “solidifies the religious liberty accommodation” that she asked for, now that Kentucky law no longer puts clerks in Davis’ predicament.“The injunctions are gone and Kim Davis received the accommodation that she requested,” said Mat Staver, Davis’ attorney at Liberty Counsel, a faith-based law firm. “County clerks are no longer forced to compromise their religious liberty and conscience rights.”Asked if he’d seek a further appeal of the contempt order, Staver acknowledged that “it is past and cannot be undone,” but insisted that “it has no continuing effect either.”As for gay couples in Kentucky, the law that gave Davis relief also benefits them. It goes into effect on Friday, and will allow, in the ACLU’s words, “all loving couples to obtain marriage licenses in the state without fear of discrimination.”"

A female soldier had accused him of sexual harassment and said he should seek “mental health” help, according to The Washington Post.Ryan responded that Congress is weighing bipartisan legislation on mental health and has been pursuing efforts to reform the VA health system. He said nothing about restricting the sale of guns, and argued that a Senate bill to bar gun sales to people on the FBI terror watch list wouldn’t prevent mass shootings.“What we don’t want to do is pass a law that we know violates a law-abiding citizen’s rights, take away their rights without their due process,” Ryan said. “That is unfortunately what I think many people are asking Congress to do. The Senate already defeated it. That’s not what we want to do.”Hughes was attending a Black Lives Matter rally in Dallas last week when a gunman opened fire on police officers, killing five. Police initially identified him as a suspect because he was pictured carrying a gun, which Texas allows. After police and city authorities tweeted his picture, Hughes turned himself in. He was released after questioning. Hughes later told reporters he had received death threats because of his notoriety.“Y’all have my faces on national news, are y’all gonna come out and say that this young man had nothing to do with it?” he asked of police. “We’ve been getting death threats. It was persecution on me, unrightly.”"

They’re hoping to get some volunteers to walk dogs, and since Pokemon Go enthusiasts are walking all over the place in search of Pokemon anyway, they’re the perfect candidates.“The idea is that they take the dog on kind of an adventure for the day,” Phil Peckinpaugh, shelter director, told The Huffington Post.Peckinpaugh, who said both his nephew and daughter play the game, got the idea after noticing “droves” of people all over the city of Muncie hunting Pokemon with their games.“It would be great if every one of those individuals had one of our dogs with them,” he said. He teamed up with Sam Wiser, an intern in the mayor’s office, and she created the volunteer ad that’s since gone viral on Facebook.It’s also gotten plenty of attention IRL, with many people responding who want to walk dogs.“We have a line of people here right now,” he said Wednesday morning.People walking a dog while playing the game — or really, anyone playing the game — should be careful to pay attention to their surroundings and not inadvertently walk into traffic or another dangerous situation.And even if you live nowhere near Muncie, there’s a good chance your local animal shelter would be happy to have you volunteer to bring a dog out on your pursuit of Zubats.Peckinpaugh encourages other shelters use the idea to get volunteers.“I hope it catches on like fire,” he said."

Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) were invited Tuesday to speak at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, sources familiar with the planning of the event told The Huffington Post.The news is significant because of a report that same day from The New York Times saying that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) had been given a prime speaking slot for Tuesday night of the convention. It’s a good place to be, but it’s not the vice presidential nominee’s spot, and the report immediately raised suspicion that Warren had been ruled out by the Clinton campaign for the No. 2 spot, with the Times calling it “an apparent sign that Senator Elizabeth Warren will not be named Hillary Clinton’s running mate.” The Clinton campaign has repeatedly said no VP decision has been made and that Warren is under consideration.That invites also went out to Kaine, Booker and Becerra, top prospects as well, reinforces that the decision has yet to be made. Cabinet secretaries such as Tom Perez, who have also been floated, have been told by the White House they can’t speak at the convention. No matter what slot a politician is scheduled for, sources said, they can quickly be moved if they are named VP. Selecting Warren, who is broadly popular among Democratic voters, is seen by some inside the Clinton campaign as a way to excite the base and drive turnout. Warren could also help Clinton find the base of support she’ll need to govern. President Barack Obama has implemented a series of progressive initiatives the past two years and, as a result, the Democratic base has rallied around him, which has driven up his approval rating and helped him govern.While some have suggested that Warren would be better able to advance her progressive agenda from the Senate, she appears to disagree with that analysis, and there’s good reason to believe she’d have much more power as vice president.This post has been updated with more details on Warren and considerations around the VP pick.

The Huffington Post’s David Lohr witnessed the encounter and live streamed it on Facebook. A man who identifies himself as Byron Cole in the video above was protesting that evening in Baton Rouge when he noticed that the journalist appeared to be “covering” his Fox News badge while reporting on the scene. The incident spurred a multifaceted conversation, during which Cole broke down the double standard in the way authorities police certain communities.In predominantly black neighborhoods, “the officer has tons of discretion and he can decide to shoot a man down in the parking lot of a gas station,” he said. “Whereas where white people live, it’s operating under a legalistic system, which has to go by the book.”Last week, two black men, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, were shot and killed by police officers. According to The Washington Post, African Americans are overrepresented in police shooting statistics. African American citizens account for 24 percent of those fatally shot and killed by the police, despite being just 13 percent of the U.S. population.But the protester didn’t just address issue of police violence. The media’s portrayal of police shootings can be just as problematic, he said, particularly when outlets report on black death without giving the community a chance to tell its own stories. “I know that. You know that. Fox News knows that. CNN knows that,” Cole said. “And what the deal is y’all won’t have no more room to air anything in our neighborhoods and benefit off our tragedies, unless we gonna talk about what the hell we want to talk about.” Cole, who was also live streaming his encounter with the reporter on Facebook as the conversation was taking place, said the proliferation of social platforms has democratized the media. These days, traditional news sources aren’t the only options for citizens looking to stay informed, he said. “We are empowered and we don’t have to rely on any of your institutions to spread any of the words because, first and foremost, y’all mitigate everything and you spin everything from your perspective...” he said. “All black people now have smartphones and we’re all aware of the contradictions and the double standards. The cat’s out the bag, man. We understand.” Speaking to Lohr after the incident, Cole said the reporter’s attempt to cover his badge was what spurred the confrontation. “And I told [the reporter] that was part of the problem in America, really, that he felt he had every right to be out here documenting everyone, just because that’s his job...,” he said. “Why do you feel it’s okay to come and monitor us and document us, but not allow [us to do the same].”Watch the conversation unfold in the video above.

The Japanese company’s first venture in mobile gaming brought market-value gains of $7.5 billion in just two days after the game’s release last week."

But that doesn’t mean they’re sitting out the 2016 elections entirely.Super PACs and nonprofit groups have already spent at least $101 million in most of the states hosting contested Senate races that will determine which party controls the chamber in 2017. In almost every state where control of the Senate is at stake, groups aligned with Republicans dominate. In all, Republican groups have spent $70 million of the $101 million total.That $101 million continues the steady increase in spending by super PACs and nonprofit groups since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United ruling and subsequent lower court decisions ― which allowed corporations, unions and individuals to spend unlimited money on elections so long as they remain independent from candidates and political parties.One-third of the 2016 Senate outside spending is concentrated in just one Senate contest. Outside groups have already spent $34 million in the Ohio race between Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland (D). Of that total, $24 million was spent by Republican-aligned groups and $10 million spent by those affiliated with the Democratic Party.Similar disparities in favor of Republicans exist across most of the key Senate races in Arizona, Illinois, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (The parties in Florida’s Senate race have not yet selected candidates in their respective primaries.)In New Hampshire, groups supporting Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) outspent those backing Gov. Maggie Hassan (D), $15 million to $7 million. In the race to replace retiring Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), groups supporting Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nev.) spent $9.8 million compared to $2.5 million for those in support of former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto. Outside groups supporting Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) spent $6 million, compared to $1.6 million spent by those backing former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.). The races in Arizona and Missouri have seen hardly any spending by pro-Democratic groups, but have seen $2.3 million and $3 million, respectively, in spending from pro-Republican groups.There are only two races where spending either tilts in the favor of the Democratic candidate or is relatively close.In Illinois, first-term Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) has been almost entirely abandoned by Republican groups as he seeks re-election in an overwhelmingly Democratic state. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has spent $550,000 to support his candidacy, but no other group has spent a dime. On the other side, the Natural Resources Defense Council ran at least $1 million in issue ads targeting Kirk last year for his vote to prevent the implementation of the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan.The outside spending in the Pennsylvania Senate race between Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) and Katie McGinty (D-Penn.) still favors the Republican incumbent, but the gap is closer than other top-tier races. Groups supporting Toomey have spent $10 million, compared to $7.2 million from those backing McGinty.The top spenders in all of these races are the same. On the Republican side, support comes from groups connected to the billionaire Koch brothers ― including Freedom Partners Action Fund, Americans for Prosperity and Concerned Veterans for America ― as well as from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and One Nation, a nonprofit group connected to both Karl Rove and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). For Democrats, the biggest spender remains Senate Majority PAC, which is led by former staffers of Reid, the Senate minority leader. Environmental groups and labor unions contribute to Democrats as well.The spending total comes from a variety of sources, including Federal Election Commission records, press releases and advertising data provided by a Democratic source. The total is focused on the general election and does not include expenditures for or against primary candidates who lost. It does include express electoral activity calling for the election or defeat of a candidate, and issue advertising that praises or attacks a particular candidate up for election in the 2016 campaign cycle. Since issue advertising, which does not directly call for the election or defeat of a candidate, is not disclosed, the totals listed are minimum amounts and could be higher.Those issue ads come entirely from nonprofits that do not disclose their donors. Even though they often directly attack a candidate up for election, issue ads help dark money groups fulfill their requirement to spend 51 percent of their time and money on non-electoral purposes, thanks to lax enforcement from the IRS.More than half of the Senate outside spending this cycle ― $54 million ― has come from these dark money groups. Republican-aligned spending is far more likely than pro-Democratic expenditures to come from groups not disclosing their donors. Dark money accounts for two-thirds of the pro-Republican spending, compared to just 27 percent of the Democratic outside money.The Ohio Senate race has seen the highest amount of dark money spending, with $13.5 million, but that accounted for only 40 percent of overall spending. Dark money spending accounted for more than half of all outside spending in every other Senate race examined here.In New Hampshire, which has seen the second most outside spending, there has been $13.4 million in dark money spent out of a total of $22 million. All but $100,000 of that total comes from groups supporting Ayotte, the Republican incumbent. Almost all of this money comes from One Nation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Koch-connected Americans for Prosperity.Koch groups, One Nation and the Chamber are not the only big spenders. In individual races, other outside groups have emerged with large advertising campaigns.For example, Ending Spending Action Fund, a super PAC funded by the billionaires Marlene Ricketts, Paul Singer, Ken Griffin and Linda McMahon, has spent $1.3 million to promote Ayotte and attack Hassan, her Democratic challenger. The group, using the name Commitments Kept NH, has run ads accusing Hassan of failing to respond to the state’s opioid addiction crisis.Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a Republican clean energy nonprofit previously funded by environmental groups connected to Democrats, has run more than $700,000 in advertising to promote Ayotte’s record on the issue.Groups engaged on specific national issues have made a splash in spending in some races. The conservative nonprofit Judicial Crisis Network has spent seven figures across multiple Senate races in support of senators refusing to hold hearings on President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland. The National Rifle Association has spent over $1 million in the Ohio Senate race to support Portman, while Americans for Responsible Solutions, a super PAC headed by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) that supports gun control, is a major spender in the New Hampshire campaign.Some candidates are further buoyed by their very own super PACs. In Ohio, Fighting for Ohio Fund, a pro-Portman super PAC headed by a former Portman staffer, has spent more than $3 million. Arizona Grassroots Action, a super PAC supporting Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), has spent more than $800,000. Kirk and Toomey each have super PACs solely dedicated to supporting them as well, but they have not made their mark yet.In all likelihood, these groups will only increase their spending as Election Day approaches. Already, groups like Senate Majority PAC and Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC run by former aides to McConnell, have reserved tens of millions of dollars’ worth of airtime over the next few months. The $101 million in outside spending that we’ve already seen is only the beginning.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to Catherine Cortez Masto as a former lieutenant governor of Nevada.

In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, the presumptive Republican nominee continued to make the argument it was the IRS audit preventing him from disclosing the finite details of his personal finances ― from the tax breaks he took, to the charitable donations he’s made. But in a telling aside, Trump seemed to admit that he wasn’t disclosing his returns because of the political damage he feared they would inflict. “Mitt Romney didn’t want to give his tax returns” in 2012, Trump said of the previous Republican presidential candidate. “He fought like crazy. Then [Sen.] Harry Reid lied, told a total lie in the Senate, a vicious lie that was untrue. And then Mitt Romney, very, very late, decided to give his tax returns. Now, remember this, I’m under audit. It’s a routine audit. Nobody would do that while they’re under audit and everybody understands that. But let me tell you, he gave those tax returns and they were absolutely fine. He was destroyed. They went through his returns, which were peanuts compared to what I have. You saw the stacks of paper. He gave his returns, and they found little items, little items in those returns that were nothing.”  Trump’s reference is to an episode in which Reid said he had heard from an investor at Bain Capital, Romney’s old private equity firm, that Romney had paid no taxes for 10 years. Romney denied the accusation and denounced Reid. He ended up producing 1.5 years of filings showing that he had paid a tax rate of roughly 14 percent ― in other words, extremely low. For that, Romney endured difficult headlines.Presidential candidates don’t normally acknowledge that they are taking a position in order to avoid tough headlines. But that’s precisely what Trump seemed to be suggesting on Wednesday. Trump did give himself cover by continuing to insist that IRS audits are to blame for his failure to reveal his tax returns. But that seems even less legitimate now. Ironically, Trump was among the choir of those urging Romney in 2012 to release his tax returns more quickly to get those headlines out of the way. Now, it’s Romney who is arguing that Trump is hiding some sort of shocking revelation in his own returns. Trump said on Fox News that a revelation of his tax returns “could happen if the audit is finished.” If it doesn’t, he would become the first presidential candidate in modern history to never release his tax returns.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Meyerson Symphony Center on Tuesday in Dallas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57858a8c1b00002700f6d959.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― George W. Bush doesn’t get out much anymore, but not because he’s frail. He just turned 70, but seems in fine health.We don’t see him much because he doesn’t love the limelight ― or politics, really. Never did. The Bush family took a pasting in the Republican primaries this year. His presidency is to many a bitter memory.He once told me that if politics didn’t work out he’d be happy to sit in a fishing boat out on a Texas lake. I believed him. He isn’t going to Cleveland for the GOP convention (neither is Mitt Romney and about a score of Republican U.S. senators).But there Bush was on Tuesday, front and center at a memorial service in his hometown of Dallas. He has avoided most of public life, but it had come crashing in on him in the form of the deadly, racially motivated ambush of five Dallas peace officers.His suit was bright blue and his hair was thinning, but he was pretty much as we remembered him: the aw-shucks stiffness, the nervous lick of the lips, the almost self-mocking smile, the careful, almost halting reading of a big-lettered speech text in a binder.This somewhat diffident Bush was the best public Bush, and it came when he stood on broken ground and faced up to the worst ― as he did after 9/11. His failure to be that Bush ― urgently, immediately ― after Katrina in New Orleans cost him dearly.It became a metaphor for indifference, and yet, when forced by circumstances to argue against indifference, Bush was effective.That’s who he was on the stage of the Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas.The press focused on the speech that followed by President Barack Obama, who in his powerful way argued both for the centrality of policing and the pain of minorities hounded by the police.To the extent that the press noticed Bush, it was to remark on his odd dance-like moves on stage, or to quote him eulogizing the locals.But the audience responding to something else ― which was Bush’s careful, expressive defense of a view of America utterly at odds with the man who next week, in all likelihood, will be officially crowned as the nominee of Bush’s Republican Party.“At times, it seems like the forces pulling us apart are stronger than the forces binding us together,” Bush said, without mentioning Donald Trump.“Argument turns too easily into animosity. Disagreement escalates too quickly into dehumanization. Too often we judge other groups by their worst examples, while judging ourselves by our best intentions.”The audience applauded heavily at this.“And this has strained our bonds of understanding and common purpose.“But Americans, I think, have a great advantage. To renew our unity, we only need to remember our values. We have never been held together by blood or background. We are bound by things of the spirit ― by shared commitments to common ideals. “At our best, we practice empathy, imagining ourselves in the lives and circumstances of others. This is the bridge across our nation’s deepest divisions. And it is not merely a matter of tolerance, but of learning from the struggles and stories of our fellow citizens, and finding our better selves in the process.“At our best, we honor the image of God we see in one another. We recognize that we are brothers and sisters, sharing the same brief moment on earth, and owing each other the loyalty of our shared humanity.“At our best, we know we have one country, one future, one destiny. We do not want the unity of grief. Nor do we want the unity of fear. We want the unity of hope, affection, and high purpose.”It was eloquent, and appropriate, and everyone knew to whom the message was directed.Too bad that most of the Republicans who agree with him either aren’t bothering to go to Cleveland for the GOP convention ― or will sit silently in their delegate chairs while Trump roars.

29,POLITICS,"Bernie Sanders Told His Supporters To Get Behind Hillary Clinton, And They're Doing It",Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-supporters-hillary-clinton_us_5786a845e4b0867123df87a3,One motivator: keeping Donald Trump out of the White House.,2016-07-13,Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after a long primary battle.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5786ac441a000023006fa439.jpeg?cache=Obqy1N2fwV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After Bernie Sanders endorsed Democratic primary opponent Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, die-hard fans of the senator threatened that they wouldn’t be as willing to transfer their allegiances to the presumptive nominee. But for all the talk of Sanders supporters moving to the Green Party, staying home or even voting for GOP candidate Donald Trump instead, already some of his backers are lining up behind Clinton. Her campaign announced a spate of endorsements in the day after Sanders said he was backing her for president. It is also holding what it’s calling “Stronger Together” events this week in swing states to emphasize the need for Democrats to come together behind her, some of them featuring those former Sanders supporters.Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) endorsed Clinton on Wednesday, writing in a blog post that he “was feeling the Bern” but that Clinton “offers strong progressive values, a remarkable tenacity of spirit, and has demonstrated a capacity to listen.”Eleven current and former elected officials from his state, most of whom endorsed Sanders, signed onto a letter backing Clinton on Wednesday, along with other progressives in the state.In Michigan, three Sanders delegates issued a statement on Wednesday urging their fellow Sanders supporters to join Clinton. Three Pennsylvania delegates for the senator did the same on Tuesday, as did three Florida student leaders. And in Colorado on Thursday, a Clinton press conference is to feature four Democrats who caucused for Sanders: former state House Speaker Terrence Carroll, state Sen. John Kefalas, Hillary for Colorado Campus Coordinator Spencer Carnes, and retired teacher Nancy Perlmutter.Braddock, Pennsylvania, Mayor John Fetterman (D) appeared in a Clinton campaign video released Tuesday to explain why he supported her, calling himself “a proud former Bernie supporter” and saying “there is far too much at stake in this election to stand on the sidelines.” After a long primary battle, the Clinton campaign is clearly eager to unify Democrats behind a single candidate, particularly with the Democratic National Convention coming up later this month. Sanders has not technically dropped out of the race, but his endorsement was an acknowledgement that he lost the nomination process and that it is important to now work together to defeat Trump. “Secretary Clinton has won the Democratic nominating process, and I congratulate her for that,” Sanders said on Tuesday. “She will be the Democratic nominee for president and I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States.”Many of his backers expressed disappointment with his endorsement, and some said they would vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein instead.More broadly, evidence suggests Sanders supporters will stick with Democrats. Pew Research Center polling found that 85 percent of his Democratic and Democratic-leaning supporters planned to vote for Clinton in the general election ― an even greater proportion than supporters of Clinton in 2008 who said they would vote for President Barack Obama. Only 9 percent of Sanders supporters this year said they would support Trump; 6 percent said they would vote for another candidate or were unsure, according to Pew. The Clinton campaign has been working to bring Sanders supporters on board through direct appeals, events and efforts to adopt some of his messages. The former Sanders backers now urging support for Clinton touted his influence on the race, tying the two Democratic candidates together on issues. “We are proud that she and Senator Sanders worked together on drafting the most progressive party platform ever put forward by the Democratic Party,” Minnesota Democrats wrote.More switched endorsements are likely to come. Even before Sanders’ endorsement, the 700,000-person labor union Communications Workers of America moved its support to Clinton on Monday, but other unions that backed Sanders have not yet done so.Trump seems to be making a play for Sanders supporters to move to him, pumping out press releases and tweets pointing out Sanders’ past criticisms of Clinton. For the Sanders supporters now backing Clinton, though, Trump’s main influence is motivating them to join together to defeat him. “We face a fundamental choice this election and I call on all Bernie Sanders supporters to unify behind Hillary Clinton,” Michigan convention delegate Ethan Petzold said in a statement via the Clinton campaign. “There is no other way to defeat Donald Trump. Bernie Sanders believes this, and I am with him.” "

Mijente, a new “political home for Latinx and Chicanx organizing,” is on a mission to “wall off [Donald] Trump’s politics of hate” during the Republican National Convention, taking place next week. In a video posted on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo, Mijente’s community organizer Tania Unzueta says the organization is teaming up with The Ruckus Society, Iraq Veterans Against The War, The Other 98%, The Working Families Party, as well as volunteers to build a 15,000 ft. banner wall around the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, where the GOP convention is taking place next week. She explains the wall will be a symbol to wall off Trump’s hateful, xenophobic rhetoric at the convention. Mijente is inviting students, veterans, parents, children and community organizers to join them in decorating, painting and erecting sections of the wall. They’ll provide the workspace, fabric, paint and stencils necessary to help #WallOffTrump at the convention. “Our wall won’t be the kind of wall that divides cultures and families,” the organization’s campaign page reads. “But a wall that brings us together to fight for a better future for our children.” Mijente goes on to say Trump’s vision for the country is as small as his hands and his “Make America Great Again” slogan “is code to take our country back to a past of racial segregation.” Unlike Trump’s divisive rhetoric and proposed wall, Mijente says their wall “will celebrate the beautiful potential our people hold.”To learn more about Mijente and their proposed wall, check out their crowdfunding page at Indiegogo or visit wallofftrump.us.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

The three groups agreed to pay a combined total of $233,000 in fines. They were also forced to disclose that they were funded by CPPR, although this was already disclosed in tax filings made to the IRS. The fines are the result of a complaint filed in 2014 by the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.“These rules provide some of the only windows into the funding of dark money groups, but the FEC almost never penalizes groups that break them,” CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement. “It is hard to overstate how significant this is.”CPPR, now known as American Encore, was a central hub in the dark money network operated by billionaires Charles and David Koch that distributed hundreds of millions of dollars through a web of conservative nonprofit groups from 2009 through 2012. The group and Noble were ultimately cut loose from the network after CPPR was implicated in a political money-laundering case in California. According to a report by ProPublica, Noble’s removal from the Koch network may also have come after he directed tens of millions of dollars through his own consulting firms.Noble’s employment of his own consulting firm, Noble Associates, is the key point in the FEC’s ruling that the three nonprofits had failed to comply with federal disclosure laws. According to all three conciliation agreements, the three groups each received millions of dollars from CPPR and then spent that money on millions of dollars of advertisements targeting Democratic senators and congressmen for defeat in the 2010 elections. The three groups spent CPPR’s money through media vendors who produced advertising and determined which candidates to target. In each case, Noble’s consulting firm was working as a subcontractor for these media vendors. This was not disclosed in any prior filing with the IRS or the FEC. According to the conciliation agreements, which are based in part on Noble’s own statements, he “identified the specific targets candidates for [the groups] to target and played a role in approving the content of [the groups’] advertisements, and learned how [the groups] would use the funds that CPPR provided [the groups] to further specific advertisements.”Groups engaged in certain types of independent spending targeting federal candidates are required to disclose any donors who specifically earmark funds for a particular race. In this case, Noble’s involvement as the chief funder of the groups and those groups’ media vendor meant that he was earmarking the funds CPPR contributed to those groups.Key in the FEC’s determination is Noble’s own admission in a National Review article that he helped craft the advertisements run by the three groups CPPR funded.These groups had, for years, insisted that the money provided to them by CPPR was directed to their general fund and not specifically earmarked for particular races. CPPR specifically stated on its tax forms filed with the IRS ― under the penalty of perjury ― that its grants were made solely for education and social welfare purposes. The FEC ultimately determined that this was not the case."

The human-sized mosquito, a reproductive rights advocate with NARAL Pro-Choice America, made an appearance to denounce Republicans’ lack of action on the Zika epidemic. Members of the House and Senate are struggling to agree on a plan to address the virus, and House Republicans have proposed a solution that could make it harder for women in Zika-affected countries to access birth control and family planning services.“Republicans don’t have a plan for Zika, but mosquitoes do,” the man told people waiting in line for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing as he handed out miniature cans of bug spray. The Zika virus can be spread by mosquitoes or through sexual contact, and it has been linked to microcephaly, a severe birth defect that causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads. Hundreds of babies have been born with microcephaly throughout the Western Hemisphere after their mothers contracted the virus, and the first baby was born in Texas on Wednesday with the Zika-related condition.While Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) urged his colleagues Wednesday to act swiftly on funding efforts to combat Zika, Republicans have largely ignored the need to provide access to free contraception amid a public health crisis that has the most devastating effect on pregnant women.Some Latin American countries have advised women to delay pregnancy for two years because of the epidemic. Yet many of the countries where Zika is rapidly spreading have strict anti-abortion laws and even jail women who attempt to end their pregnancies.Nonetheless, Republicans have proposed to limit the use of USAID funds for contraceptives and family planning in Latin America by directing NGOs to use the money for mosquito control, vaccines and diagnostics instead. They went a step further last week, proposing to eliminate the Title X Family Planning program, which provides low-cost family planning and health services.At Wednesday’s hearing, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) expressed her frustration with the situation, urging her colleagues to help women in Zika-affected countries access free contraception. “We can’t have one hand tied behind our back by saying, as the House said, that none of this money can be used for non-governmental organizations to provide birth control, which is so critical,” Boxer said.“Countries think they solved a problem when they just tell the women, ‘Don’t get pregnant,’” she added. “There’s something wrong with that on so many levels.” "

Why did he pull over on the side of a rural road to take a call? And why did he have to be stationary to talk on a mobile phone? These were just some of the questions trending in Uganda on Tuesday (July 12) when the country’s leader stopped his motorcade, unfolded a what looked like a deckchair (or likely, his aides did the heavy lifting) and took a call on the side of the road. His press secretary Lindah Nabusayi tweeted these puzzling photographs:After three decades in power, it seems Museveni can still surprise Ugandans, or at the very least, entertain them. Curious residents of the Isingiro village wandered over to inspect the unusual traffic disturbance. Soon, the twitterverse came over for a closer look too.Ugandan Twitter erupted with thousands of hilarious tweets:The 71-year-old president’s choice of a more classic cellphone model also attracted some scrutiny:Then came the memes:No one could answer why exactly the president took what seemed to be extraordinary measure to take a call, but that didn’t stop them from imitating him.

The 30-year old administration is not known for transparency (a contested election is just one example), but it is becoming known for the president’s gaffes. Just last week, he repeatedly referred to Israel as Palestine during prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s state visit to Uganda in an awkward international incident. While Museveni holds on to power, he is providing reams of great comedy material.This article originally appeared on Quartz Africa.
