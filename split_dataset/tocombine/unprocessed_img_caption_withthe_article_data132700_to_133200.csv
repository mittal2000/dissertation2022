The ""joke"" Mohr was referencing was something he said on his podcast after hosting the Dec. 6 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Champion's Awards in Las Vegas where Milano was a presenter. “It seems like she had a baby and said, ‘I don’t really give a s**t’ ... I read it on her gut... Somebody sat in the director’s chair and was not wearing Spanx and I was like, ‘Jesus Christ,'"" he said, in part. Milano's comeback was pitch-perfect and completely classy.There was no immediate response from Mohr. Milano's fans (aka, anyone who grew up in the 80s), however, applauded her.

""Comedians have a hole on their insides that can only be filled by generating constant content that is, many times, improvised in the moment. Unfortunately, in rare instances, it causes irreparable harm,"" it begins.I know full well how much words can hurt people, having seen my wife get destroyed by the tabloids, and I am embarrassed that I didn't think before I spoke. Alyssa is an extraordinarily beautiful person—both inside and out. Alyssa is a mother, a wife, an actress, and a class act that should always be celebrated. Sometimes comedians go too far. I went too far. I cannot change what I said, but I can assure you that my heart is broken that I hurt her. I am very sorry. With the utmost sincerity, Jay MohrRead the full statement here on Mohr's website.As for Milano, she accepted Mohr's apology, and raised him one joke. We're certainly glad the comedian came around. However, one thing is clear: Alyssa Milano showed Jay Mohr who's the boss. "

Bankruptcy is frequently the product of a history of problems. The unrelenting decline in manufacturing and the more recent collapse of the housing market resulted in a shrinking population, rampant unemployment and high debt, which have devastated the city.Click here to see the best-run cities in America: Click here to see the worst-run cities in America:In order to determine the performance of the nation’s largest cities, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 100 largest U.S. cities by population. We considered a variety of factors, including the area’s economy, job market, crime level, and welfare of the population. This year, the best-run city is Irvine, California, while the worst run is San Bernardino, California.Identifying appropriate criteria to compare cities can be challenging because large cities vary so much. Some have wealthy tax bases, while others fight declining populations and home values. A few have been burdened by struggling industries, while others have healthier service- or innovation-based economies. Because of such differences, a spending or tax policy that can be frugal in one city can be disastrous in another.Many of the cities that rank poorly have faced difficulties outside of their control. In San Bernardino, Stockton, North Las Vegas, and Hialeah — all bottom-ranked cities — homes lost more than 40% of their value in the past five years, inflicting a severe economic hit.Cleveland, another poorly ranked city, has suffered from the national decline in the manufacturing industry. Like Detroit, the cities’ poverty rates are more than double the national rate.Still, some of those factors can be at least mitigated if a city is well-managed. It is the responsibility of city planners to prepare for the worst. Mayors, school boards, and city councils all have a role to play in that regard and must work with the resources available to keep budgets balanced.In some cases, this means facilitating growth of emerging industries that attract skilled, educated, and well-paid taxpayers to a region. Seattle, Austin, and Scottsdale, all among the best-ranked cities, have managed to do this well.Strong or weak fiscal management also has an impact on city ranking. Looking at a city’s debt rating as an indicator of fiscal management shows a clear pattern. The debt of the majority of the best-run cities is rated Aaa by Moody’s Investors Service. None of the worst-run cities received that perfect score. And some, such as Detroit, Stockton, and North Las Vegas, are rated below investment grade.These are the Worst-Run Cities in America, according to 24/7 Wall St."

Recently we heard rumors about the iWatch, a release date for a bigger iPad, a Siri-enabled smart dock, Apple-designed eyewear and more.Wireless charging on the iWatch?!A December report from Ctech, a Chinese site, relayed by G4Games, says that wireless charging could be coming to the so-called iWatch, Apple's wrist-worn device that we keep hearing about, but never see. According to G4Games, the watch, which reportedly will come with a 100-mAh battery, can charge from up to a meter away from a charging station.But you're going to have to wait for it ...Even though we've seen reports that the iWatch could arrive in the second quarter of 2014, the Ctech report, via G4Games, says it's not coming until October. iOS 7.1 Coming in MarchBGR's Jonathan Geller reported recently that iOS 7.1, the update to Apple's latest mobile operating system, will be released in March. The details are scant at this point, though according to reports the new version could include, along with bug fixes, iOS in the Car integration and more accessability options, like a a darker keyboard.Larger iPad Release DateWe've previously heard that a 12.9-inch iPad (iPad Pro?) would be released in the second half of this year, and now a report in DigiTimes is claiming a release date of October. Apple's iPad has a 9.7-inch display while the iPad Mini has a 7.9-inch display. A Siri-enabled ""Smart Dock""AppleInsider last month pointed us toward a patent application that was filed for an always-listening ""smart dock"" that could allow people to use Siri, the voice-activated personal assistant, without ever picking up an iPad or iPhone. The dock, according to AppleInsider, would have a microphone, a speaker, and even a touchscreen and wireless inductive charging capability. To do anything beyond being a basic clock radio, though, it would need an iOS device. Of course, there are already Android phones, namely Motorola's Moto X and some Droid handsets, that have ""always-listening"" functionality.A ""Desk-Free Computer"" It's not a desktop, it's not a laptop and it's not a tablet. (And no, it's not a Surface 2.) According to AppleInsider, Apple on Dec. 17 got a patent for a ""desk-free computer"" that would be ""externally wire-free."" And instead of using a monitor, the box would project (via a light bulb, LED or maybe even ""laser-diode"") onto a wall or other surface.But as AppleInsider explains, this would be more than a traditional projector. It would be equipped with a camera, accelerometer, and ambient light and depth sensors to ""collect data regarding a display surface's color, texture and other features to dynamically produce an optimized image.""Apple Glass ...Well, it's more Oculus Rift, the virtual reality 3D gaming headset, than Google Glass, the search giant's Internet-connected eyewear. According to Patently Apple, in December a patent was published for a head-mounted display for watching media and perhaps playing games in 3D.The display, which according to the patent ""may resemble ski or motorcycle goggles,"" could one day have a pretty cool feature: The device could adjust an image so someone who wears prescription glasses could use the headgear without wearing their specs. It's certainly not the first time Apple has received patents for this type of technology, as Patently Apple notes, but it's clear the company is taking wearable tech seriously. Check out the images from the patent on Patently Apple. "

The 2014 Golden Globes take place on Sunday 12 January. Historical drama '12 Years a Slave' and crime film 'American Hustle' won most nominations for the Golden Globes with seven nods each Thursday, as Hollywood's awards season gets into full swing. In a crowded field of hotly-tipped movies, black and white road movie 'Nebraska' came next with five nominations for the Globes, to be handed out next month in Beverly Hills. AFP PHOTO / Robyn Beck (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb447553c000032000c9079.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During my 20-plus years on television, I've witnessed my fair share of industry shenanigans, many I can't repeat. The movie ads touting Golden Globe Awards winners, even though the winners have yet to be handed out, fall under the ""idiot shenanigan"" category. Look, I'm all for a good shenanigan. But this is like a kid telling his parents he got the lead in the school play when he really just made the first cut. It's silly. It's wrong. It's deceptive and laughable. Here's what happened. There are two good movies, Philomena and August: Osage County, which received multiple Golden Globe nominations. However, ads suddenly appeared with the words WINNER and JULIA ROBERTS next to Roberts' face in an ad for August: Osage County -- not to mention WINNER, BEST ACTRESS and MERYL STREEP next to Streep's picture. Philomena did the same thing with Judi Dench's Best Actress Drama nomination by sliding in the word WINNER. There is just one problem: The Golden Globe Awards show is weeks away. So, clearly no winners have been announced. When I saw the ads on TV, I thought, ""What? The studios are not stooping to that level, are they?""I quickly paused my DVR, hit rewind to the beginning of the ad and pressed play. Oh yeah, there is some serious stooping here. In fact, I had to squint to see the words nomination and nominee, because they were dwarfed by the word WINNER.I figured the Hollywood Foreign Press Association would have something to say about this since the Golden Globe Awards is its baby. I've worked with the HFPA since the late 1990s when I was on Access Hollywood and always found them quick to react to a situation. On occasion, I'd question their reaction and some were indeed head scratchers, but they usually had a fairly quick response to a situation. They reacted quickly. According to a number of sources, HFPA President Theo Kingma sent a warning letter to various studios, public relations firms and campaigners that it is unacceptable to use the word WINNER in ads touting Golden Globe Awards nominations for their films. But here is the rub. This is, in part (a very small part), HFPA's fault. You would never see this leading up to the Oscars, because the Academy prohibits this kind of wording in Oscar advertisements. The Academy dictates and controls, often to a fault, every single aspect of the Oscars. The HFPA not so much. Think of the HFPA/Golden Globe Awards as the uptight Academy's hip, cool and fun cousin. I have chatted with nearly every nominated major star over the years on the red carpet and they prefer the atmosphere of the Golden Globe Awards to the Oscars. Don't get me wrong, they'd rather have an Oscar if they had to choose, but the Golden Globe Awards are loose, they serve you dinner and hand you champagne as you walk into the ballroom. I'm going to that cousin's house for Christmas dinner. Once inside, the stars mill about their tables, catch-up with other stars and actually meet some of them for the first time. We often think that all the stars must know each other, but often times I've found that they don't and are eager to meet someone whose work they admire. It was always fun for me to see the interaction before the show and during the commercial breaks. This was especially so as the show ran into it's second and third hours and the alcohol started to kick in. Juxtapose that with everyone at the Oscars sitting in rows of seats and nervous as all get-out because, well, it's the Oscars!Look, I get the studios' motivation for touting nominations and pushing the envelope in these ads. It's money. There is a good breakdown on BoxOfficeMojo.com showing a significant boost in box office revenue once a film is Oscar nominated. So, it stands to reason studios would try the WINNER route with the Golden Globe nominations to juice the box office. I say keep the champagne, continue the fun of the Golden Globe Awards but check the ad shenanigans at the door."

Rumor has it that Katy Perry may be in talks to follow in his and Spears' footsteps.While Meat Loaf represents one faction of Vegas shows (long-established artists who no longer need to hit the road to maintain their legacy), Spears has concertgoers thinking younger. Will Vegas residencies of the future focus on artists who are simply opting out of jet-setting road travel even if they're still in their prime? A residency is a rare opportunity to craft a show that's distinctly the artist's -- no road crews or conditions dictated by individual venues. Everything is tailored to the performer, including the fans who flock to Vegas to see them, and it can often create a more intimate experience.In keeping, we've thought up 19 acts, including Perry, who could easily sell out months' -- or years' -- worth of Vegas shows.Who would you like to see take the stage in Vegas?

Truly, I cannot think of one sound ethical argument in favor of slaughtering animals for their meat.The simplest way to put it is that slaughtering animals for their meat is a socially-permissible ethical transgression. Societal permission does not make it ethical, it just makes it acceptable. Slavery was for centuries socially-permissible (in spite of the fact that there was always a minority standing firmly against it). Did that make it any less unethical? I doubt anyone today would say yes.As a pig farmer, I live an unethical life shrouded in the justificatory trappings of social acceptance. There is more, even, than simple acceptance. There is actually celebration of the way I raise the pigs. Because I give the pigs lives that are as close to natural as is possible in an unnatural system, I am honorable, I am just, I am humane -- while all the while behind the shroud, I am a slaveholder and a murderer. Looking head on, you can't see it. Humanely raising and slaughtering pigs seems perfectly normal. In order to see the truth, you have to have to look askance, just like a pig does when it knows you are up to no good. When you see out of the corner of your eye, in the blurry periphery of your vision, you see that meat is indeed murder.Photo credit: ""A Happy Pig on Stony Brook Farm"" @fudehouse via InstragramSomeday, certainly not any time soon, perhaps centuries from now, we will know this and accept this as well and as much as we know and accept the evil of slavery. But until that day, I am and will remain a paragon of animal welfare. Pigs on my farm are as piggy as pigness, the ideal form of the pig. They root, they lounge, they narf, they eat, they forage, they sleep, they wallow, they bask, they run, they play and they die unconsciously without pain or suffering. I truly believe I suffer their death more than they.The grapple of ethics hooks us and we begin to struggle when we look askance. Do so, please. See through the false legitimacy of the bucolic alternative to factory farming, an alternative that is but another obfuscating layer of the justificatory shroud that hides the ugliness of raising animals to kill them so that we can eat their meat. Look and see who I am and what I do. Look and see who and what the animals are. Look and see what is on your plate. Look and see that society acceptably says yes. Ethics, I believe, universally, unequivocally and undeniably says no. How can you justify taking a life for gustatory pleasure? It is in looking askance, consciously, that we take the first steps in our evolution towards becoming the kind of beings who do not construct systems and infrastructures whose sole purpose is to kill beings whose sentience and capacity for emotional and empathetic lives our understanding has barely scratched the surface of.What I do is wrong, in spite of its acceptance by nearly 95 percent of the American population. I know it in my bones -- even if I cannot yet act on it. Someday it must stop. Somehow we need to become the sort of beings who can see what we are doing when we look head on, the sort of beings who don't weave dark, damning shrouds to sustain, with acceptance and celebration, the grossly unethical. Deeper, much deeper, we have an obligation to eat otherwise.It might take incalculable generations of being hooked by and grappling with the ethics of slaughter to get there. But we really do need to get there -- because again, what I am doing, what we are doing, is wrong, even terribly so.More of Bob Comis' writing can be found at stonybrookfarm.wordpress.com."

Given the usually dedicated nature of football fandom, why do we develop crushes on certain teams, and why do we call that ""hipster"" anyway? Humans are essentially herd animals whose choices are largely determined by the group or, more interestingly, by key influencers within the group. This is the key tenet of Mark Earls' book Herd, which examines how humans behave with a view to understanding consumer action from a marketing perspective. Earls argues that humans are collective and empathetic, qualities that have developed in an evolutionary time scale as necessary qualities for survival among a species that develops emotionally and consciously through interaction with others. He also argues that humans try to act as individuals and perceive themselves as individuals, and that this is done for several reasons: Western philosophy has taught us that the individual's free will and responsibility is of primary importance; individuals tend to retrospectively justify their decisions by effacing the herd aspect to fit into this reading of culture; and our ability to misremember the origins of our decisions assists this process.Recognition that key influencers shape opinion is not new, and research by consumer groups has identified this quality in certain individuals who can shape opinion and sentiment by their utterances. Earls takes this a step further and adds that these individuals, who he labels ""super-conductors,"" are in fact influential by their nature and their ability to frame a narrative rather than simply state it. This places a greater importance on both style and credibility of a narrative, rather than just the basic number of people exposed to a ""super-conductor's"" opinion. These individuals are not didactic, but influence by example and exposure, rather than simply telling us what we should like. Their communication is an example of what Earls terms endogenous word-of-mouth, that is generated socially within the system rather than parachuted in from an external body (in his discussion, the difference would be between socially-generated buzz and direct marketing). This form of word-of-mouth communication is more lasting and more influential. People, in their desire to appear individual, are more likely to adopt something if it is not directly shoved at them, but rather if it is discussed and made to look interesting and popular with no overt attempt to persuade. Hipsters are very well socialized people; an individual who is well attuned to prevailing herd behaviour. They are receptive to endogenous influence and adept at copying but, like all humans, are also quick to assert the essential individuality of their choices. The coalescence of hipster choice is a reflection of the herd nature of their decision, but also of the quality of their decision-making. And so, finally, to football: How do hipster clubs come about? In a way, I've already shown how I will answer this question, though there are nuances that apply to football. We all have different reasons for pledging to a club, but our affection is usually intransigent. Increasingly, however, people are stating affection for teams, largely based abroad, as a second, third, and even onwards, club. While our choice of first team doesn't change, there is a fluid appreciation of other clubs. And often, these affections are for the so-called hipster teams, and are quite centered on certain, predictable outfits. The two clear examples of this in the last three years are Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund. Easy choices, you might say: They play fast, attacking, at times breathtaking football; they have young teams; they play with an ethos; they had or have charismatic coaches who are urbane and witty; they don't need heart and character and running all day to win games. And indeed, that's pretty much it. We like these teams because they're great teams. But -- and this is why I droned on about Earls earlier -- we are pulled into these choices. Social media and the more social forms of journalism, such as blogging or opinion-heavy, quality writing such as sometimes found on the Guardian, feature these teams more than others. There are various reasons for this. In part, there is a natural antithesis to the ""English game,"" harum-scarum rushing about, in the better print media and blogosphere. These writers will naturally advocate teams who do not suffer from what are commonly perceived as English flaws. This extends to the meta-narrative of the national game, where both Barcelona and Dortmund, with a core of homegrown players raised in a philosophy of football which elevates touch, control and creativity, and after a concerted effort by the national governing bodies of those countries to create just such a philosophy, contrast markedly with the perceived lack of skill and planning in our own national team setup. We can appreciate not just the skill of these teams, but the philosophy that generated them; that is the narrative at least, and it allows us to bemoan similar failings at home. The journalistic system is predisposed towards elevating certain styles of play, schools of football, and once these teams and styles are so elevated, it is natural for the herd for follow. These teams will then enter a mainstream discourse and the herd will notice and claim that discovery for themselves, and thus, the team becomes hipster.I chose, at the behest of some other football writers, teams I feel will become ""hipster"": these are Anderlecht, Basel, Real Sociedad, Dinamo Zagreb, Fiorentina, Atheltic Bilbao, Swansea and Austria Wien (and Marseille and Napoli as maybes). These teams all fit the criteria above to a greater or lesser extent. Most have a spine of young, homegrown players; all play attacking, pressing football for the most part; and all are featuring in European competition which makes them more likely subjects for mainstream media articles (Basel's victory over Chelsea is significant in this regard, and they have two very exciting young Egyptian players which opens another set of potential narratives). Anderlecht boasts some of the up-and-coming members of the new ""golden generation"" of Belgian footballers, another country that, unlike England, has poured money and effort into nurturing youth and are now reaping the benefits. Additionally, la Real and Athletic have an interesting political dimension. Zagreb are automatically more likely because Jonathan Wilson, a key influencer, writes a lot about Eastern European football, and Swansea are Premier League but not English, which is considered a benefit (you can like them and Laudrup without forsaking your own EPL team). I would say, though, that despite the reaction when they recently played Dortmund, I am a bit more dubious about Napoli -- They do not fit my model so easily, though the urban, gritty setting of the team, like with Marseille, adds credibility for a certain type of hipster. Anyway, for all these reasons, the clubs listed above are attractive teams for super-conductors to write about them, and write they will; the herd will simply follow, as they did with Barcelona and Dortmund. I want to touch lastly on two other teams, very briefly. St Pauli and St Etienne are both, in my opinion, hipster teams of a more durable quality. St Pauli, as described marvellously in The Blizzard's Issue Zero, are a team rooted in left-wing politics and the alternative, which automatically makes them a contender; hipsters love the outsider precisely because they are not mainstream. They are also well-branded and appeal from a visual perspective: everyone loves a piratical skull and cross-bones. St Etienne are evocative of a by-gone era of elegance, Gallic flair and insouciant cool, and have featured in some of the best European Cup games, and have cropped up in The Blizzard a number of times (without doubt, probably the single biggest super-conductor by virtue of reach, quality and aesthetic values which make it a very easy thing to admire and, therefore, follow). The great thing for hipsters about football is that you can flit from one club to another when it comes to crushes. You may be stuck with Hartepool, but there is nothing to stop you tuning into St Etienne vs. Bastia and getting all quivery about it. The ephemeral, trending nature of these clubs fits with the fluidity of social networks and allows a football lover to stay true to their first choice while demonstrating knowledge, interest and sociability by being interested in other teams. Because they are more highly socialized, hipsters are more receptive to this trending and less concerned about staying fixed to one club or brand anyway. It will be, of course, interesting to see if I'm right in my choices. The great thing is by writing about them I've already started the process. Sneaky, right?

That is the question facing a number of collegiate players who have a few weeks now to determine whether to return for another season or declare for the NFL Draft.Any player whose high school class graduated three years ago is eligible -- that means juniors and redshirt sophomores. If a key player, especially a quarterback, leaves a college program it can substantially alter the outlook for success in 2014. Louisville QB Teddy Bridgewater has made the decision to enter the draft, UCLA's Brett Hundley had a Sun Bowl for the record books and is still deciding, and it is almost certain that Texas A&M QB Johnny Manziel will leave.How do they make this decision? When I advise parents and players in this process I start with one proviso. If a player has college goals he has not achieved, needs another year of maturation, or simply wants to finish his education on time -- he should go back to school. Criticizing a player for returning to school for another year is unfair. If a player is contemplating early entry because he feels economic pressure, or fears injury, or feels ready for the next level, then an analysis needs to be made.The first step is to attempt to project how high in the draft the player will go in this year's draft and compare it to a projection of how he would be drafted a year later. The timing is unfortunate, players need to make this decision in mid-January, before the whole second season of college scouting has taken place. It is necessary to accurately assess how a player will perform at the combine and at the pro-scouting day on campus. The depth at the player's position in the current year as opposed to the following year needs evaluating. When the junior rule was instituted, I helped advise Jeff George, Drew Bledsoe, Dan Wilkinson and Ki-Jana Carter who all came out early and were the first overall pick in the draft. Desmond Howard was the 4th pick in the first round. Other players I advised went back to school. I never wanted to be part of a process which unrealistically inflated a player's prospects. The NFL will provide a player and his family with the league's prediction of the player's round in the draft if he comes out. Sometimes these projections are exceeded by the player. College coaches can be information sources. USC's Pete Carroll was public in his advice that Mark Sanchez not leave school. It is certainly much easier to retain the current star than recruit the next one. At Penn State, Coach Joe Paterno advised RB Ki-Jana Carter to leave because his position was so injury prone. This year Washington RB Bishop Sankey declared for the draft after carrying the ball 600 times over the last couple years and lighting up the Fight Hunger Bowl.If economics are the chief concern, the comparison of draft position this year as opposed to next can be translated easily into a contract comparison. Rookie bonuses have been dramatically reduced by the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement. Especially in the first round, the bonuses and guarantees can drop dramatically from the top picks in the round to the bottom. Players yearn to be picked at the top of the draft. Most of the franchises are drafting high because they had losing records and rookies drafted by them may face some losing years. All of the projections which are made can be altered by unforeseen college injuries or NFL personnel moves. Certain football positions require constant repetition to master. It takes a quarterback time to read the field and master an offense. Offensive line play can be improved with an extra year at college. Most players will benefit by another year in college, with the exception of running backs. At the end of the process most players decide by doing introspection and deciding if they currently feel ready for the next level and next challenge in their lives. The dream of young football players is to play in the NFL. It is a matter of personal choice as to whether this is the right time to try."
