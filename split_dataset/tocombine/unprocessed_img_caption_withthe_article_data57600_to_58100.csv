0,WEIRD NEWS,Drowsy Driving Delivers Unto Us A Horde Of Bees And Thousands Of Potatoes,Krithika Varagur,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drowsy-driving-bees-potatoes_us_572cf2fae4b096e9f091635d,End times.,2016-05-06,Bees actually have a history of buzzing free in driving accidents. Here beekeepers wait to start clearing the scene in Washington state last year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572cf863160000580431dfe7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There were a couple of rude awakenings for sleepy drivers this week. Under the apparent influence of inadequate rest, a truck driver spilled 50,000 pounds of potatoes on a highway in North Carolina, and another unleashed millions of bees on the Wyoming interstate.The two incidents are just the latest in an epidemic of drowsy driving, which is linked to over 300,000 accidents every year. The potato incident took place around 2:00 a.m. on Friday in Charlotte. Night-shift workers are among the highest-risk populations for drowsy driving crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.This driver, who was taken to the hospital, is expected to recover, according to WSCO News. But the crash led to a partial shutdown of that stretch of Interstate 77 for several hours.“Maybe he fell sleep and sadly hit the guard rail,” Garrett Bonacci, another motorist who stopped to rescue the driver, told the news station. “Thank the Lord he's all right.”The truck driver confirmed that he had dozed off to the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, according to the Charlotte Observer. He said he’d heard of truckers being arrested in the state for pulling over to sleep, so he decided to try to make it through. The honey bee incident took place two days earlier, on Wednesday afternoon near Laramie. The beehives broke open when the driver apparently fell asleep and wrecked his truck, the Laramie Boomerang reported.Highway Patrol Trooper Aren Peter said that ""probably a football field in any direction from the truck was swarming with honey bees,” according to the Boomerang.Beyond truck drivers, drowsy driving is fairly common among the rest of us as well. As many as 1 in 25 Americans admit to having fallen asleep at the wheel in the prior month, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
1,BLACK VOICES,5 Hunger Strikers Hospitalized 16 Days Into Protest Against SF Police,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-hunger-strikers-hospitalized-16-days-into-protest-against-sf-police_us_572d099de4b096e9f091806f,"Since April 21, the protesters have survived on liquids like coconut water and cups of broth.",2016-05-06,"Five protesters on a hunger strike, known as the Frisco 5, were all hospitalized on Friday, their 16th day without solid food.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572d2329160000e90031e027.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Five protesters were hospitalized on Friday 16 days into a hunger strike in front of a city police station.Dubbed the Frisco 5, the four men and one woman demand the firing or resignation of San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr because of several fatal shootings by police. ""Due to their deteriorating health, all five of the hunger strikers have been hospitalized,"" spokeswoman Yayne Abeba said in an email. She declined to specify their individual conditions, but said they would continue to strike while under medical supervision. ""They will be monitored more closely by a professional group of doctors,"" said Abeba in a video recorded by Mission Local.Sellassie Blackwell, 39; Edwin Lindo, 29; Ike Pinkston, 42; Ilych Sato, 42; and his mother Maria Gutierrez, 66, have subsisted on coconut water, juice and cups of broth since April 21 while camped in folding chairs and tents in front of the police building in the Mission district.One of the protesters reported shedding 15 pounds since refusing to eat. Blackwell, a rapper, was briefly admitted to the UCSF Medical Center on Wednesday for blood work, but returned to the group that evening. Supporters of the Frisco 5 occupied parts of City Hall on Friday afternoon, according to the San Francisco Examiner.For the first time, Mayor Ed Lee spoke by phone with the members of the group on Thursday. He'd previously tried to meet them in person by arriving unannounced at the station on Monday, but the group refused to sit down with him. Lee told them that Suhr maintains his support, and that both are committed to reforming the department, according to a statement from the protesters. The mayor's office didn't immediately respond to HuffPost's inquires, while a police spokeswoman declined to comment about the strikers' worsening health. ""We wouldn't have any information on their condition,"" said the spokeswoman. The San Francisco police department has been dogged by complaints that officers quickly resort to lethal force in altercations with suspects. In early April, officers fatally shot a homeless man they said charged them with a knife, though critics said the police should have tried de-escalation first. The Dec. 2 shooting of Mario Woods, a stabbing suspect, has led to large protests around the city. Woods died from 20 gunshot wounds, and critics said that officers opened fire though he posed them no risk. The Department of Justice is investigating the shooting.In addition to the controversial shootings, the department has been dogged by a recent scandal over racist and homophobic text messages sent among a group of cops.

2,IMPACT,Homelessness In Los Angeles Jumped 11 Percent Last Year: Report,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/la-homelessness-11-percent_us_572a5bc9e4b096e9f0902e47,"On a positive note, veteran homelessness fell by 30 percent.",2016-05-06,"This Friday, Feb. 27, 2015, photo shows a sign advertising a house for rent in Los Angeles. More than one-in-four renters must devote at least half of their family income to housing and utilities, according to a new analysis of Census data by Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit that helps finance affordable housing. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Homelessness rose last year in L.A., further fueling concerns about the city’s growing crisis.The number of homeless people in the city jumped 11 percent from 2015 to 2016, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) announced on Wednesday.The news comes eight months after officials declared a homeless “state of emergency” and just weeks after Mayor Eric Garcetti pledged $138 million to tackle the issue. “I've been predicting the problem was going to get worse before it got better,” City Councilman Mike Bonin told The Los Angeles Times. At the heart of the problem is a dearth in viable housing options.Metropolitan Los Angeles has less than a 3 percent housing vacancy rate. And the city needs about half a million units to shelter its poorest residents, the Los Angeles Times reported last year. Garcetti’s “bold” plan aims to address that very issue.The mayor’s proposed budget is more than quadruple the $34 million allocated for the current fiscal year. He said most of those funds will be used to build permanent, affordable housing for low-income communities.But critics remain wary of exactly how the mayor will come up with the money to end the crisis that affects one third of the nation’s chronically homeless population.The city has been working on identifying alternative funding sources.In March, city council members proposed a number of measures that could bring in money for housing for homeless, which included taxing marijuana in order to raise the estimated $2 billion needed for the initiative. A 15 percent tax on pot sales and cultivation would bring in about $16.7 million annually. While advocates remain concerned about the general homeless population, some specific demographics experienced notable declines this year.Veteran homelessness fell by 30 percent this year and family homelessness dropped by 18 percent.Experts say those figures speak to the effective results that come when government agencies and nonprofits work together.“Homelessness responds to resources,” Peter Lynn, LAHSA executive director, said in a statement. “When we have systemically applied City, County and federal resources, we see results.”"

Jeb Bush (R) says he won't vote for his party's presidential nominee in November.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572cfcd0160000580431dff0.jpeg?cache=s5GsF31ZyY&ops=crop_0_1301_3264_2196%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush says he won't be supporting Donald Trump in November, becoming one of the highest-profile Republicans to disavow his party's presidential nominee. ""Donald Trump has not demonstrated that temperament or strength of character. He has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative. These are all reasons why I cannot support his candidacy,"" Bush wrote in a Facebook post Friday afternoon.Bush noted that he won't vote for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton either.""In November, I will not vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, but I will support principled conservatives at the state and federal levels, just as I have done my entire life,"" he said. ""For Republicans, there is no greater priority than ensuring we keep control of both chambers of Congress. I look forward to working hard for great conservatives in the Senate and House in the coming months.""Trump was relentless in going after Bush during the presidential campaign. Early on, he branded the former governor as ""low energy,"" a devastating characterization he was never able to shake. Trump also went after Bush's Mexican-born wife at one point, saying Bush liked ""Mexican illegals because of his wife."" Since Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee, a number of Republicans have said they still won't vote for him -- some have even disowned the Republican Party. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who endorsed Bush after he dropped his own presidential bid, also said this week that he won't be backing Trump. The real estate mogul issued a statement Friday essentially saying he didn't care. ""I fully understand why Lindsey Graham cannot support me. If I got beaten as badly as I beat him, and all the other candidates he endorsed, I would not be able to give my support either,"" Trump said, adding, ""While I will unify the party, Lindsey Graham has shown himself to be beyond rehabilitation. And like the voters who rejected him, so will I!""Right-leaning groups are also starting to throw in the towel on the presidential race. In a Wednesday blog post titled ""What Now?"", CatholicVote.org said it won't support Trump and instead will focus on ""4-5 critical Senate races along with as many as 10+ House seats."" Similarly, Club for Growth President David McIntosh lamented that Trump is not ""a genuine pro-growth conservative"" and said the group will focus its attention on House and Senate races this year.On Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said he was ""just not ready"" to support Trump -- although he left open the possibility that he would be comfortable doing so at some point. Trump is scheduled to meet with House GOP leaders in Washington on Thursday, when he and Ryan will also meet separately. Read Bush's full Facebook post:"

The announcement was made in conjunction with Joining Forces, an initiative founded by first lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden, which works with the private and public sectors to empower veterans.Some of those companies include Amazon, Microsoft, Siemens and USAA.Amazon will provide 10,000 transitioning military members, veterans or military spouses with training and certifications for cloud computing skills. The company will also train 25 wounded vets at boot camps that will prepare them for roles in cloud computing and jobs at commercial companies that operate in the tech space.It’s also going to hire 25,000 vets and military spouses.Microsoft will invite veterans to partake in one of three 18-hour courses at its in-house academy.Such initiatives have helped drive down the veteran unemployment rate.The unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans dropped to 5.8 percent in 2015, down from 6.9 percent the previous year.Joining Forces also announced that 40 companies pledged to hire more than 110,000 veterans and military spouses over the next five years.One of the tech companies involved is Sharp Decisions, which provides business and technology consulting services. The company pledged to hire 500 veterans over the next five years.Through its vet-specific program, the company also provides free training in quality assurance, project management, business analysis, cloud security and cyber security. Graduates then move on to work for Sharp Decisions. “I knew how much sense it made, from a business standpoint, for our veterans and for our country, to get veterans working in the technology space,"" CEO Karen Ross said in a statement."
5,CRIME,Officer Captured After Shooting Spree Leaves 3 Dead In Maryland,"Sebastian Murdock, Andy Campbell, and Melissa Jeltsen",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maryland-mall-shooting_us_572cc8dae4b016f378958fac,"Police say Eulalio Tordil, 62, fatally shot his wife on Thursday, and opened fire on two shopping centers Friday.",2016-05-06,"Eulalio Tordil, 62, is in custody after allegedly fatally shooting three people, including his estranged wife, and wounding three others.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572cefc7160000e90031dfd5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal officer is in custody after allegedly shooting three people dead and injuring three others within 24 hours in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, in three separate locations.Eulalio Tordil, 62, allegedly shot and killed his estranged wife on Thursday evening outside High Point High School in Beltsville, Maryland, and wounded another person, according to police.He evaded capture, and on Friday opened fire on multiple victims 12 miles away in Bethesda, at the Westfield Montgomery Mall, killing one person and wounding two others, police say. As officers were responding to that shooting, they received another call: Tordil had allegedly fatally shot a woman at Aspen Hill Shopping Center.Plainclothes officers found him a few hours later at a Dunkin' Donuts location, but they stayed back. Police said at a press conference that officers surveilled Tordil for an hour, worrying that he might open fire if they approached. Tordil was eventually arrested without incident.It's unclear why Tordil, an officer with the Department of Homeland Security, continued his violent rampage into Friday morning. Police haven't yet determined his relationship -- if any -- to the other victims.According to court documents obtained by The Huffington Post, Gladys Tordil filed a protective order against her husband in March. She alleged that her husband once slapped her so hard he broke her glasses on her face, and that he subjected their children to “intense-military-like discipline — push ups, detention in dark closet.”“He threatened to harm me if I leave him,” she wrote in all caps.She also indicated that he had access to a number of firearms, including handguns and an assault rifle. Under the conditions of the permanent restraining order, which was granted on March 17, Tordil was ordered to immediately surrender all firearms to a law enforcement agency, and refrain from owning any guns while the order was in effect. However, he was granted permission to carry his work-issued firearm while on work premises.The restraining order stipulated that he stay away from High Point High School, which is where police say he shot his wife on Thursday when she was picking up her kids.A witness at the Westfield Montgomery Mall, 54-year-old Jose Gomez, told The Washington Post on Friday that he heard six to eight shots outside the shopping center. He and a police officer rushed to help a wounded woman, who had been shot in the shoulder.“That’s when blood shot out of the hole in her shoulder and [the officer] sat her back down,” Gomez said. “I lived the war in El Salvador,” Gomez added. “I’ve witnessed gun battles before.”The shootings in the D.C. metro area over the past 24 hours invoke memories of the 2002 so-called ""Beltway Sniper"" incident, in which John Allen Muhammad shot and killed 10 random people over the course of three weeks in the district, Virginia and Maryland."

It had belonged to the borough since 1941.Construction began this week, Katz said, and is expected to wrap up next spring.There are only a handful of statues depicting historical female figures across New York City. Of Central Park's 22 historical figure statues, zero are women."

The custom has brought reverends, rabbis, priests and imams to the floor to address lawmakers. And though there are no written rules determining exactly who can and cannot lead these ceremonies, the House chaplain recently told atheists that they are not welcome.The Freedom From Religion Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for the separation of church and state, says House Chaplain Patrick Conroy unconstitutionally discriminated against the group's co-president when he blocked him from leading a secular invocation. On Thursday, the FFRF filed a lawsuit against Conroy, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and others, asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for relief.The litigation is the latest development in a contentious fight over the role of religion in government. It specifically tests the question of whether nonbelievers must be allowed to participate in proceedings that have traditionally been seen as forums for religious expression.FFRF Co-President Dan Barker began exploring the idea of delivering a secular invocation in 2014, weeks after the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of religious prayer in government meetings as long as such policies are nondiscriminatory. The FFRF says the ruling means that all people -- regardless of their faith, or lack thereof -- must have an opportunity to participate.The complaint claims Conroy's process of vetting guest chaplains is discriminatory. Barker says he was told he'd be required to have a House sponsor, to present a certificate showing he was officially ordained and to address a ""higher power"" in his observance.While the FFRF alleges that these rules are unfairly designed to exclude atheists, Barker was actually able to meet them. First, he found a sponsor in Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), who represents the district where FFRF headquarters are located. Then, Barker provided proof of his ordination. Though he publicly announced his atheism in 1984, Barker was an active and ordained Christian minister before that, and still keeps his credentials updated so he can serve as a wedding officiant.The suit claims Barker even took the extra step of providing a draft of his planned remarks to the chaplain, in an effort to show he was being ""genuine"" in his request and not seeking to mock the practice. The draft, which you can read in full below, mentions the ""higher power"" of ""We, the People of these United States,"" who elect lawmakers to serve the public good.In January -- almost a year after Pocan submitted Barker's application -- Conroy officially rejected it. He told the congressman that Barker was unfit to deliver an invocation because he had ""announced his atheism publicly"" and was not a true ""minister of the gospel.""The FFRF waited to sue Congress until after Pocan had assured the group he'd done everything he could to get the invocation approved, including warning Conroy that the group was preparing legal recourse, Barker told The Huffington Post. When the chaplain still wouldn't budge, the FFRF strategically filed the lawsuit on May 5 -- the National Day of Prayer -- when elected officials around the nation encourage Americans to pray and contemplate the role of religion in their lives.""We're making the claim that [Conroy] doesn't like atheism and that he doesn't think atheists can properly solemnize or recognize a higher power and that atheists do not have a place as a guest chaplain,"" Barker said in an interview. ""What right does a government official have to decide who's in and who's out? What right does anybody have in our secular country to say, 'Nope, you don't have the right views, so you don't get to solemnize the occasion'?""HuffPost reached out to the chaplain's office for clarification on Conroy's decision to block Barker, but was referred to the Speaker's office. A request for comment from Ryan's office was not returned.Although the FFRF is specifically challenging the constitutionality of excluding atheists and other nonbelievers from delivering an opening invocation, the organization also points out that Christian prayer has long monopolized the practice. All House chaplains have been Christian, and they have delivered the majority of the 2,198 invocations between 2000 and 2015 because they lead prayer when there isn't a guest scheduled.But the 857 guest appearances over that period have done little to tip the balance. Judaism is the second most-represented religion, with 59 invocations over the past 15 years. A small handful of religious leaders from other faiths have also been invited to the House floor.This trend continues despite the fact that the nation has become more spiritually diverse. Nearly one-quarter of Americans now place themselves in the broad category of religious “nones” — those who are religiously unaffiliated or simply don’t believe in God. Despite this growth, there are still no open atheists in Congress, and only one — Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona — lists herself as religiously unaffiliated. More than 90 percent of Congress identifies as Christian.While the religious demographics of Congress have a long way to go to begin reflecting the general population, the FFRF says accepting guest invocations from nonbelievers would be a positive gesture of inclusion.""The House of Representatives should be representative,"" said Barker. ""What's the rationale for keeping out those of who don't believe in God? Are we less able to solemnize and celebrate and encourage and be a part of the process? It's like having the door slammed in our face.""The FFRF says it doesn't have to be this way. According to the group, since 2004, nonreligious individuals around the country have given more than 75 documented invocations at legislative meetings or before state legislatures, all without significant controversy.But it's clear that some officials would prefer government prayer not to be so all-embracing. And the House isn't the only governmental body that has made a point of specifically barring atheists from participating.In Arizona, state Rep. Juan Mendez (D), an atheist and advocate for the secular community, has faced substantial pushback in his attempts to offer an opening invocation to his colleagues.

9,POLITICS,Why Hillary Clinton Is Uniquely Suited To Take On Donald Trump,Sam Stein and Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-election_us_572cae72e4b016f378957726,The king of branding is going to have a hard time changing voters' perceptions of Clinton.,2016-05-06,Clinton isn't well liked. But she is well known. And that might be more important.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Back in the fall of 1989, a group of researchers published a paper looking at the ways in which individuals contort the circumstances surrounding them into their preexisting world views.This particular investigation, titled ""Expert Decision Making in Evolving Situations,"" gave 11 groups of Army intelligence analysts a realistic battlefield scenario and asked them to assess the most likely avenue for an enemy attack. The scenarios were largely the same, though with slight variations to produce different answers. Each group was given time to study and each expressed confidence in their answers. The noteworthy stuff is what came next. The groups were given updated intelligence reports and asked to reconsider their assessments. Some reports contained items confirming initial judgements. Others were designed to spur skepticism. The majority were neutral. The process was then repeated two more times. In the aggregate, the level of confidence should have stayed roughly the same. But what the researchers found was that the groups grew more convinced in their initial judgements the more information they received. Only one of the 11 teams changed its assessment of how the enemy would attack. Seven of the 11 teams expressed more confidence in their call over time. Additionally, the subjects gave significantly more weight to information that reinforced their earlier decisions. Not only that, but when presented with contradictory evidence, they were dismissive or downplayed its significance. Confirmation bias like this had been observed before. What stood out to the researchers was that individuals trained to be open and sober-minded were now exhibiting it. ""The results of this experiment lend support to the general conclusion that trained subjects in an evolving, realistic, decision environment demonstrate performance characteristics similar to those of novices working with less realistic and relatively more static scenarios,"" the study read. ""Specifically, confidence in an initial hypothesis is generally high, regardless of the hypothesis.""Presidential campaigns are not literal battlefields. And voters are not Army intelligence analysts. But as the 2016 general election comes into focus, the same behavioral patterns observed in this study will play a significant role in determining the next president. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, filleted a field of 17 Republican primary candidates by branding them in uniquely terrible ways: Little Marco Rubio, Lyin' Ted Cruz and Low Energy Jeb Bush. With his attention shifting to November, the fear among preternaturally panicked Democrats is that he will do the same against his likely opponent: Hillary Clinton. Trump has already begun trying, adding the descriptive ""Crooked"" to her first name.But political scientists and branding experts aren't so sure that he'll find much success. And it goes back to ""Expert Decision Making in Evolving Situations."" Referencing that specific study, Timothy Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, noted just how hard it is to mold perceptions when people have already thought through their choices. ""It is very hard to reposition a well-established brand, and what we have here are two really well-established brands,"" Calkins said of the election matchup. ""There is a whole idea of mental exhaustion. When you force people to really think about something, it is difficult and challenging. And the easy thing to do is to just not think about it. For someone to really challenge and change their beliefs requires a lot of energy."" At its current juncture, the Democratic primary is boiling down to a fight over electability. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who trails in pledged delegates, has argued that party insiders should switch their votes to him precisely because his polling numbers are better suited for the general. And that's true. Sanders does better in mock contests against Trump. His favorability ratings are far superior to Clinton's. These strengths, however, are somewhat cosmetic. Though he's been on the trail for over the year, Sanders is not as known a political figure as Clinton. He's faced a tiny sliver of the negative attacks. As The Huffington Post reported in mid-April, of the roughly $383 million spent on campaign television advertising in 2016, only about 2 percent was on anti-Sanders ads, much of which just briefly mentioned his name or featured his image. ""People are pointing to his general election numbers as being stronger than Clinton's, and that's largely a byproduct of the fact he hasn't seen incoming fire,"" said Brendan Nyhan, a political science professor at Dartmouth College and a columnist for The New York Times.Clinton, by contrast, presents a surer bet, albeit with less potential upside. Should she secure the Democratic nomination, she would have a favorability rating worse than any general election candidate in history ... save for Trump himself. But she brings advantages to the ticket too. On the trail, Clinton touts the political battles she's experienced as proof that she can succeed where Little Marco, Lyin' Ted and Low Energy Jeb failed. The impression left is that she has the political acumen to navigate a race against Trump. But what she is also underscoring is that she has the longevity to not be defined by her opponent. Like those Army intelligence officers, the voters have studied her resume, and new parcels of information will simply be plugged into their preexisting views.  ""People have an amazing ability to reinforce what they believe,"" said Calkins. Consider this: In public opinion polls, a full 96 percent of the public is able to rate Clinton either unfavorably or favorably, the same percentage as Trump. By comparison, 86 percent of the public was able to rate Mitt Romney when he was the presumptive nominee in May of 2012. In July of 2015 -- roughly when the Republican primary began -- 67 percent of the public was able to rate Ted Cruz and 64 percent of the public was able to rate Marco Rubio. The public is about as likely to have a strong opinion about Clinton at the start of the general election as they were to have any opinions about Cruz or Rubio at the beginning of the GOP primary. Across recent polls, more than 60 percent rate her at one extreme or the other: either ""very favorably"" or ""very unfavorably."" Since last June, her numbers have moved relatively little, considering all the campaigning and negative headlines. Her average unfavorable rating has drifted from the high 40s to the low- to mid-50s, but that is likely due to dissipating goodwill from her time as secretary of state. Her favorable rating has dropped, but it's likely to rise again should disaffected Democrats (Sanders supporters) come back on board. The numbers are relatively static for Trump, too. Despite being the most divisive political figure in the country over the past year, his unfavorable rating remains in the low 60s (the same place it was in June 2015). His favorable rating is the one that's changed, rising from the mid-20s to the mid-30s, presumably as Republican primary voters have gotten to know him as a politician.""Look at Trump,"" said Nyhan. ""With all the stuff that has been said about him, his unfavorables ... they barely changed. This whole time. With everything that has been said about him. It is strikingly stable."" In a year without Trump, the case could be made that Clinton would be a serious gamble for Democrats -- voters' confirmation biases would be working against her were she facing a more-liked Republican nominee. But there are other factors influencing elections beyond a candidate's favorability rating. Often, in fact, favorability ratings tend to be overstated as a metric. Nyhan has written extensively about this. While it might seem obvious that people vote for the candidate they like best, that notion often gets the direction of causality backward. In the heat of the campaign, we ultimately tend to find reasons to support candidates who share our party affiliation or seem to have a good record in office (and to oppose candidates who do not).Certainly, there are exceptions to the rule that party, not personality, is more determinative of election results. Trump could very well be one. The outsized force of his personality overshadowed nearly all the traditional contours of the Republican primary, and the next six months will test whether partisanship is an even stronger motivation.But by and large, as the general election progresses, the expectation among political scientists is that we will enter a more stable race than the current political commentary foreshadows. Republican voters will warm up to the nominee. Beleaguered Sanders supporters will find a way to Clinton. A brutally negative campaign will be waged, but confirmation biases will once again take hold. ""Public opinion figures tend to converge,"" Nyhan noted. ""When Al Gore ran, Democrats weren't enthusiastic about his candidacy but they mostly made their peace with him. [Senator] John McCain had incredible favorability numbers. But to win the nomination he became a classic Republican, and he ended up performing like a general Republican when the election came around. So personal qualities tend to be overstated relative to other structural factors.""CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post misstated what Donald Trump has been calling Hillary Clinton. He has been using the term ""crooked,"" not ""corrupt."""

I am a fool: Behold my errand.The presumptive GOP nominee has an idea for dealing with American debt and infrastructure. The first half of his plan makes sense. The second half is insane.Trump laid out his plan during a CNBC appearance, which was flagged by Binyamin Applebaum at The New York Times. Interest rates on U.S. debt are very low right now, and have been for years. This makes it a great time for the government to borrow money and spend it on public needs. Roads, bridges, whatever. If there's something that needs fixing in the United States, borrowing money to fix it is a pretty good idea right now. The boost that this improved infrastructure will give to our economy will be worth it. The economy would grow, boosting tax receipts for the federal government which would make the new debt easy to manage.Trump believes this. So does Paul Krugman. So far, so good. But then Trump suggests something truly destructive.“I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal,” Trump told CNBC. If the U.S. borrowed too much and invested its fresh cash in unproductive products, Trump would tell creditors to accept less than what he'd initially agreed to. Another way to describe this plan: ""I would default on the national debt."" Except Trump also told CNBC that he wouldn't default on the debt, because advocating contradictory positions is part of his #brand.The U.S. dollar is a global reserve currency. It is considered the least risky asset in international finance. If investors have to start taking haircuts on this debt, it means that the way money is measured around the world would be thrown into question. All kinds of businesses, both domestic and foreign, would grind to a halt as investors stopped to figure out how to sort out the mess. Even in a best-case scenario, the results would be catastrophic. Financial markets eventually sorted things out after the 2008 meltdown, but it still sparked the worst recession in 75 years. A default on U.S. government debt would be worse.And there is no reason for the government to default.The U.S. government owes $12.8 trillion to the public. The majority of this money is owed to American citizens and businesses. And the annual output of the U.S. economy is currently $18.1 trillion and growing. The federal government collects over $3 trillion in taxes every year. The national debt just isn't that big a deal. If it were, you'd see investors demanding high interest rates on American debt. But interest rates are in fact very low, meaning investors think the U.S. will not have trouble paying its debts.Even if the United States eventually saw interest rates rise, the government could easily deal with it by raising taxes or simply printing more money. Printing money would pose the risk of modest inflation over the long term, and inflation isn't an ideal way to deal with problems. But a little bit of inflation is way better than crashing the global economy.But even if you subscribe to Trump's wrong view of international finance, his comments are stupid. He is violating his own Art of the Deal negotiation standards. If you have no intention of paying off a loan, don't tell the bank. Even if you manage to laugh it all off and get the deal, you're going to have to pay more for that loan. The bank would have given you better terms if it had never been forced to question your intentions. If you're going to steal something, just steal it. Telling everybody ahead of time makes it a lot harder.But it doesn't matter that Trump said something insane and destructive. His fans do not care, and never have cared, about whether his policy positions are good or even coherent. Life is pain, and the 2016 election is making it more painful.Zach Carter is a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here or listen to the latest episode below.

12,POLITICS,The Supreme Court Is Fixing To Let Political Corruption Run Rampant,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bob-mcdonnell-scotus-podcast_us_572bc183e4b016f378953f0e,"And all for the sake of Virginia's gifty Ex-Gov. Bob McDonnell, of all people.",2016-05-06,"Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell speaks outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Wednesday, April 27, 2016, after the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the corruption case against McDonnell. The Supreme Court seems likely to overturn the conviction of McDonnell on political corruption charges and place new limits on the reach of federal bribery laws. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"So, that happened. Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was convicted by a federal jury in September 2014, after he was caught participating in one of the most cut-and-dry examples of cash-for-favors found in the political corruption textbook. Now, however, McDonnell’s appeals have taken his case to the Supreme Court, where -- believe it or not -- a majority of justices seem predisposed to overturning his conviction, and decimating anti-corruption laws. Joining the podcast this week to discuss this case is Zephyr Teachout, candidate for Congress in New York's 19th District and author of ""Corruption in America: From Benjamin Franklin's Snuff Box to Citizens United."" About a year and a half ago, McDonnell and his wife were found guilty of corruption charges stemming from their involvement with Jonnie Williams, the former CEO of Star Scientific, a dietary supplement company. A lengthy investigation proved that McDonnell and Williams essentially engaged in a straight-up exchange of money for potentially lucrative political favors.Dana Liebelson and Timothy Murphy explain over at Mother Jones that, among other things, the McDonnells, using Williams' largesse, took home a $6,500 Rolex watch, a $15,000 shopping jaunt at Bergdorf Goodman, a $10,000 engagement gift for one of their daughters, and $15,000 to cover the catering charges for another daughter's wedding.In return, Williams got the McDonnells to become dedicated shills for Star Scientific. Over the course of this relationship, McDonnell hosted events for Star Scientific at the governor’s mansion, helped ensure that Williams would have access to influential policymakers, and used his office to pressure state health officials to meet with Williams -- all in the support of earning Star Scientific's diet products credibility and sales. Recognizing that McDonnell had the juice to make all of this happen, Williams reckoned that it was cheaper for him to simply buy the governor off than it would be to take the more costly and arduous route of bringing his products to market.In short: Jonnie had the quid, McDonnell was the pro, and lo, there was quo, to and fro.As The Huffington Post’s Cristian Farias reported, McDonnell may well be on his way to a great escape, thanks to a majority of Supreme Court justices who seem, alternatively, amenable to McDonnell’s point of view, and troubled that too many prosecutors might start taking up corruption cases:“My problem is the criminal law as the weapon to cure” dishonest behavior, [Justice Stephen] Breyer said. He warned that stretching the law’s reach will mean that “political figures will not know what they’re supposed to do and what they’re not supposed to do.”But as Teachout writes in her book, the Supreme Court has already spent several decades unwinding centuries of case law governing political corruption -- to the point that right now, it’s been essentially reduced, conceptually, to little more than quid pro quo bribery of the sort in which McDonnell engaged. So, if the justices draw an even narrower standard in this case, they may permanently cripple any effort to curb pay-to-play.“After 200 years of a fair amount of consistency,” Teachout explains, “where courts understood that corruption was a central threat to democracy -- perhaps the central threat to democracy ... the Supreme Court started questioning what corruption was and whether something counted as corruption unless there was an explicit exchange -- especially in the campaign finance context.”This resulted in what she described as a sort of legal carve-out, for the benefit of political donors and their beneficiaries, so that they weren’t repeatedly taken to court for making political donations.But Teachout said this isn't what the McDonnell case is about. “This ... is not a campaign finance case. Jonnie Williams was not giving a donation to a campaign. He was giving a Rolex to put on McDonnell’s arm. He was giving a shopping spree for McDonnell’s family. This is old-school, classic corruption. Classic bribery.“What is really dangerous about this McDonnell case,” Teachout continued, “is that the court looks poised to do something similar in the bribery realm, and narrow the definition there. ... That’s the direction we are moving in.”And a majority of Supreme Court justices seem happy to nudge things along. For example, as Roll Call’s Todd Ruger reported, Chief Justice John Roberts made explicit mention of an amicus brief filed on McDonnell’s behalf from an array of former White House lawyers:Roberts brought up what he called “an extraordinary document” in the case, an amicus brief from former White House counsels to Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.Think about to what they are agreeing, though: That the ordinary business of Washington can’t get done without rich dudes handing out Rolex watches in exchange for access, favors and connections.“I thought the justices were kind of confused during the oral argument,” Teachout said. “They were on the hunt for something that could provide a clear limiting principle.”Indeed, as NPR’s Nina Totenberg reported, the justices -- with the notable exceptions of Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- seemed perplexed by this, and aggressively questioned Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, assigned to argue this case for the government. Totenberg reported one exchange during oral argument that is a fairly good example of the justices’ overall bewilderment. As she relates, after Chief Justice Roberts suggested that the existing anti-corruption laws are too broad, and unconstitutional, Dreeben was apoplectic: ""It would be absolutely stunning if this court said that bribery and corruption laws, which have been on the books since the beginning of this nation, have been consistently enacted by Congress --""It was there that Justice Anthony Kennedy interrupted: ""Absolutely stunning to say that the government has given us no workable standard?""Dreeben responded: ""We've given you a workable standard, based on this court's decisions dating back to 1914.""Dreeben is correct, Teachout said, noting that there has always been a serious limiting principle to guide courts in this regard: A jury must find that there was intent to have a quid pro quo exchange.What’s more, according to Teachout, is that “All of our history of bribery and extortion law has said official acts can include things like setting up meetings ... doing things within your sphere of public duty.” There doesn’t have to be a bill signed into law at the end of the deal for it to be an “official act.”“This is overturning 700 years of law, basically,” she said.Elsewhere on this week’s podcast: This week, New York magazine's Andrew Sullivan penned an alarming missive to America, contending that our presumed-to-be stable democracy is ripe for an authoritarian takeover.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572bd6552200008f03255ba8.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nearly 400 death row inmates in Florida are waiting to learn if their fate will change as lawyers argue death sentences imposed under a now-unconstitutional process should be converted to life without parole. Lawyers for convicted murderer Timothy Hurst on Thursday argued that because the U.S. Supreme Court in January ruled Florida's sentencing scheme unconstitutional, state law requires that death row inmates should have their sentences reduced to life imprisonment. ""There's no ambiguity,"" Hurst's lawyer, Dave Davis, told the Florida justices. ""This court -- I hate to say it's an easy job -- but it's a straightforward one."" Hurst, 37, was condemned to die by a judge for the 1998 slaying of Cynthia Harrison, a co-worker at a Popeye's restaurant, even though five members of his 12-person jury declined to recommend death. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the sentencing method gives judges too much power and violates defendants' right to a fair trial under the Constitution's Sixth Amendment.Since that U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Florida has halted several scheduled executions as lawmakers struggle to fix the state's broken capital punishment system. Vivian Singleton, an assistant Florida attorney general, disagreed that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling was so sweeping that it should apply retroactively to defendants already sentenced to death. ""In the Hurst decision, the Supreme Court did not say Florida's death penalty was unconstitutional; only that the sentencing scheme was unconstitutional,"" Singleton argued.Florida has passed at least one fix to its law, requiring that at least 10 members of a 12-person jury vote in favor of imposing death and that jurors unanimously find at least one aggravating factor that makes the crime among ""the worst of the worst."" State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Pariente seemed dubious of the fix and wondered if just one aggravating factor -- which can include the age of the victim, the commission of other crimes, and the defendant's membership in a criminal street gang -- was enough to merit a death sentence without violating the Constitution. ""If we want a death penalty in Florida, we need it to be constitutional,"" Pariente said. This week, a group of prominent lawyers and judges, including several former state Supreme Court justices, filed a brief supporting re-sentencing Florida's nearly 400 death row inmates to life imprisonment. The state Supreme Court will continue to hear arguments in the case. It's unclear when it will rule. "

Arsenault planned to take off work and wait in line early Wednesday to be sure that she would be able to adopt the dog she had her eye on. But on Tuesday night, she noticed that the organization had posted a photo of Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) with that very same dog.

""I felt like they lied to me.""Shelter officials admitted they let the governor skip the line, hoping it would be good publicity to have him adopt from them.""The governor walks in your front door and it sort of shifts things a little,"" Development Director Donna Kincer told the publication.LePage spokesman Peter Steele said the shelter offered to let the governor take home the dog, which was renamed Veto. ""He just stopped in to see the dog,"" Steele said. ""He was very pleasantly surprised when GAHS allowed him to take the dog home. Veto was pretty excited, too.""LePage has vetoed more bills than any other governor in the state's history, which prompted a response from the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. ""The governor named him Veto because he is the mascot of good public policy, defender of the Maine people and protector of hard-working taxpayers from bad legislation,"" Steele told the Portland Press Herald.

In March, a school police officer was placed on leave after a video showed him repeatedly slapping a student. In April, a Texas school resource officer was fired after getting caught on camera body-slamming a 12-year-old.Now, a group of Texas parents are hoping to receive justice for another school resource officer's alleged violence.In late April, the parents of three children filed a lawsuit against the Abilene School District in Texas, as well as against an individual school resource officer named Barry Bond. The lawsuit details three incidents in which the school resource officer allegedly physically assaulted three children, ages 6, 12 and 15. The lawsuit says the officer violated the children's rights by using excessive and unreasonable force and unjustified seizures.In the first case, the officer allegedly grabbed a 6-year-old -- who was in kindergarten and weighed about 45 pounds -- and twisted the child's arms behind his back. The officer then lifted the child off the ground ""by grabbing his arms, which were still twisted behind his back, and carried him into the classroom,"" says the lawsuit. The child had been resisting going into the classroom and separating from his mother. The maneuver used by the officer ""is a 'pain compliance' technique that peace officers are trained to use to force dangerous, physically resisting adults into submission,"" says the lawsuit. Once in the classroom, the officer slammed the child's face onto a desk, causing his head to bleed. In the second case, the officer allegedly used a chokehold to restrain a 12-year-old student. The student had been walking in the hallway and looking for the school's assistant principal after a teacher made a comment that upset him. The chokehold caused the student to lose consciousness. The officer was suspended from his job for three days a result of the incident, but soon returned to school. In the third case, the lawsuit says the officer body-slammed a 15-year-old after the student tried to walk out of the school. The student had been upset when a teacher yelled at him. The officer also slammed the student's face into a concrete wall. The student was left with cuts on his face, swollen wrists, a limp and a scar that is still visible.All victims suffered from physical and emotional trauma after the incidents. The plaintiffs are blaming the school district and the city's police department for not training Bond on how to work with children and not removing him from his post after learning of the questionable conduct.Indeed, many of the tens of thousands resource officers stationed in schools do not receive additional training on how to work with children. Instead, they may apply the same protocols to students as they use when dealing with adults. The district did not respond to requests for comment. A representative for the city said they could not comment on an open case. The officer in the case has since retired from the district, says the lawsuit. In 2015, the Texas legislature passed a law that requires school police officers to undergo special training, but this law only applies to school districts of a certain size -- and Abilene is not large enough to be one of them. The Department of Justice recommends that officers get training “to recognize and respond appropriately to youth behavior that may be a manifestation of disability.”Each of the child plaintiffs ""had very serious emotional harm and psychological anguish cause by these incidents, in addition to physical harm,"" Ranjana Natarajan, a lawyer that represents the plaintiffs, told The Huffington Post. ""Like most children, the plaintiffs in this lawsuit wanted to go to school and learn.""Natarajan said she hopes the suit serves as ""a wakeup call for the district and police department in Abilene and we hope they use it as an opportunity to rethink their school resource officer program and how it works."" ______Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

An investigation was launched into his death on Saturday, amid claims by the hospital and fans that he had not received proper care. Ekeng was given CPR during a two-minute ambulance ride to the hospital, but the vehicle didn’t have equipment that might have helped him, Romania’s Digisport reported.Ekeng had been on the field for seven minutes when he collapsed in the 70th minute of a match against Viitorul Constanta. The game was being televised live in Romania. Local media reported he had been stricken with a heart attack.It took 2 minutes, 47 seconds for Ekeng to be moved to ambulance. Once he reached Floreasca Emergency Hospital, Ekeng received CPR for more than 90 minutes before he was pronounced dead.“He was brought to us in cardiopulmonary arrest at the emergency room, in an ambulance, without resuscitation measures as far as we know,” hospital doctor Cristian Pandrea said.“We started resuscitation measures that lasted approximately one hour and 30 minutes. These measures were, unfortunately, without result.“Dinamo club doctor Liviu Batinean said that CPR was performed in the ambulance.Fans and teammates could be seen crying as Ekeng was taken away from the stadium, and mourners gathered outside the hospital.Club director Ionel Danciulescu said Ekeng didn't seem to have any health problems before the game.Ekeng joined Dinamo in 2015. He also played for Cameroon. Previously, he played for Spanish club Cordoba CF, Swiss club Lausanne, and French club Le Mans. Just two weeks ago, Ekeng netted his first goal for Dinamo, against Steaua in the semi-final of the Romanian Cup. Ekeng is survived by a wife, with whom he was due to join in France in a matter of days.Players, his former team and Brazilian soccer legend Cafu were among those mourning his death.The Romanian Football Federation announced on Saturday that it would postpone the weekend's matches and push the Romanian Cup final between Dinamo and CFR Cluj from Tuesday to May 17.Ekeng is not the first professional soccer player to die during a match. Catalin Hildan, the captain of Dinamo Bucharest, collapsed and died of a heart attack during a game in 2000. Leagues have considered increased medical screening for athletes in the incredibly strenuous sport.This story has been updated to include new medical details and news of an investigation into Patrick Ekeng's death."

Birds don’t like their communication being interrupted, and so they avoid the area.Ninety-seven percent of bird strikes occur during take-off or landing phases, so keeping birds away from airfields — the area that’s set aside for takeoff and landing — is key to preventing them.“We have conducted prior research in an aviary but this is the first study done out in the field to show the efficacy of the sonic net,” Swaddle said in a news release. “We are using a different kind of deterrent — trying to stop birds from hearing one another by playing a noise that is at the same pitch as the alarm calls or predator noises they are listening out for.”The researchers monitored the number of birds that landed at or flew over a military airfield near Newport News, Virginia, for four weeks before introducing a large outdoor speaker and amplifier, which played acoustic noise for 24 hours a day. The noise played at about the same volume as a noisy restaurant, according to the release.After they started broadcasting the noise, they recorded a reduction of the number of bird numbers by 82 percent over a period of another four weeks in the area considered within the “sonic net” — meaning the area where the sound pressure level was greater than 80 decibels. In the “mid-noise” area — the adjacent area where sound pressure level was between 65 and 80 decibels -- bird numbers dropped by 65 percent.Researchers also monitored bird levels in nearby areas to make sure that other factors, like weather, weren't throwing off their results, Swaddle told The Huffington Post in an email.Researchers will soon be testing the technology at commercial airports.""Our research team at William & Mary is working with a commercial partner — Midstream Technology — to install the sonic net technology at a couple of airports and those negotiations are ongoing,"" Swaddle said.

But Swaddle says that's unlikely to happen with sonic net technology, because sonic net technology does provide a real threat by masking the birds' communication systems.""Birds do habituate to many of the traditional 'scare' regimes (e.g., loud noises, predator sounds, fake hawks, alarm calls) because they are toothless — there’s no real threat and the birds, being pretty smart, learn and habituate to the cues,"" he said.

This is an immediate need,"" Tom Dougherty, the Secret Service's chief strategy officer, said in an informational presentation.The new fence would be about 14 feet (4.3 meters) high and the current one is 6 to 7 feet (1.82 to 2.13 meters), Dougherty said.In a second phase, the agencies plan to put enhanced fencing around the nearby Treasury Department and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Construction is expected to start in 2018.The fence project needs approval from the panel and the U.S. capital's Commission of Fine Arts before work can start.The Secret Service and National Park Service in May 2015 put in temporary security measures such as a removable feature to block climbers and barriers to keep pedestrians away from the fence.The White House has been hit since 2014 by a rash of fence-jumping incidents that helped lead to a shake-up among Secret Service officials.In the most serious breach, a U.S. Army veteran climbed the fence in September 2014 and burst into the White House while carrying a knife. President Barack Obama and his family were not home at the time. (Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Bill Trott)"
