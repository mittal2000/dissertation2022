Rodriguez arrived at 1:30am for the first deals of the season as Kmart was the first major retailer to open it's doors for pre-Black Friday shopping on Thanksgiving Day at 6am. (John Konstantaras/AP Images for Kmart)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30340220000ba01dbc24a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dhanya Skariachan and Lisa BaertleinNov 28 (Reuters) - Some early U.S. shoppers headed to stores on Thanksgiving Day in search of discounted holiday gifts on a day long reserved for American families to bond over turkey and football.Kmart, Old Navy and Lord & Taylor were some of the stores that opened their doors on Thursday morning, as each company did last year. Macy's Inc and a slew of other stores are opening later on Thanksgiving for the first time ever in a bare-knuckle brawl for a bigger slice of holiday sales.With six fewer shopping days this year than in 2012, retailers who reap nearly half of annual profits during the winter holiday season are nibbling away at the Thanksgiving holiday. But early visits to the stores by Reuters showed sparse crowds - a sign that not all U.S. shoppers are keen to open their wallets so quickly.A Walmart store in Woodbridge, New Jersey, was virtually empty at 2:30 p.m., with store associates outnumbering shoppers.The National Retail Federation expects up to 140 million shoppers to hit U.S. stores over the Thanksgiving weekend, slightly more than the 139 million who turned out last year.But many forecasters expect overall sales growth to be tepid in a season plagued by shaky consumer confidence and given that there are few fashion must-haves.Many consumers were also shopping online on Thursday. A report by IBM Digital Analytics Benchmark at 3 p.m. Eastern Time showed overall Thanksgiving online sales up 9.4 percent in 2013 over the same period last year.""Thanksgiving is the fastest growing day for e-commerce during the holiday season,"" said Andrew Lipsman, comScore's vice president of marketing and insights. ""There is a broader cultural norm where people feel it's OK to shop on Thanksgiving.""Nilka Gomez, 38, a stay-at-home mom who lives in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York, decided to cut back on spending this season to about $500 from $2,000 last year after losing her job.""There will be no electronics this year,"" said Gomez, adding that she also plans to visit a Wal-Mart store on Thanksgiving.Some say retailers' fortunes depend a lot more on wealthier shoppers who have benefited from rising share and home prices this year.""There are two sides to the story. If you look at households with over $100,000 of income, those folks are going to spend twice as much as people of incomes under $100,000,"" said FTI Consulting's Steve Coulombe.Harshad Shah, a 70-year-old real estate investor based in New York, is one of them.""We are more upbeat this year,"" said Shah, while shopping at Lord & Taylor in Manhattan with his granddaughter Eva Luskey on Thursday. ""There is a general sense that the economy is better. You see the stock market is doing better. Hopefully your stock portfolio is making a few more bucks."" EARLIER OPENINGS, HOLIDAY PAYWith ""Black Friday"" deals being offered before Thanksgiving tables were even set on Thursday, some were criticizing the retail industry's approach. Critics circulated online petitions, and a handful of franchise owners said they had defied corporate orders by keeping their stores closed.Target Corp, Best Buy Co Inc and Toys R Us are opening earlier on Thursday than they did last year. Many Wal-Mart Stores Inc U.S. locations will be open all day, with Thanksgiving specials offered beginning at 6 p.m.Department store chains Kohl's Corp, J.C. Penney Co Inc, Macy's all announced earlier this year they would open on Thanksgiving Day for the first time ever.""The ones that are opening earlier are going to get more sales, but in the end, I don't think the overall pie gets any bigger. It's just a share gain,"" said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst with Edward Jones.He also estimates that overall sales for November and December will be up 2.8 percent. That is more conservative than the 3.9 percent jump forecast by the National Retail Federation. The profit on those extra sales will depend on whether the eye-catching doorbuster sale prices are margin-squeezing loss leaders, analysts said.At Macy's flagship store in New York City, five hundred employees will be working on Thanksgiving Day. The store, one of the Big Apple's most visited tourist sites, will be open for 26 straight hours, starting on Thursday at 8 p.m. EST.A worker at Kmart in Manhattan said she had volunteered to work in order to earn extra money. Kmart workers are getting time and a half for the hours they week on Thanksgiving, Sears spokesman Howard Riefs said.Black Friday is still is predicted by ShopperTrak to be this year's biggest day of the season for sales and traffic."
1,BUSINESS,Retail Workers Ask Themselves What Thanksgiving With Family Is Worth,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/working-thanksgiving_us_5bb30336e4b0480ca6615a51,There have been people who've had to work on Thanksgiving for as long as it's been a holiday.

Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb303362400003000973a3b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"How much is a Thanksgiving with your loved ones worth to you? If you were asked to give it up, would its value be $10.09 per hour? How about $15.05, with some free turkey thrown in?Is it worth a one-time voucher for 25 percent off your purchase at Walmart?Over the past few weeks, hundreds of thousands of retail workers have performed a depressing calculus in the run-up to a great American holiday. More and more retailers are choosing to open their doors on Thanksgiving Day, meaning they need more and more employees to sacrifice a day of thanks with their families and punch in. Some workers are happy to take the extra shift. Plenty aren't.They have to ask themselves whether working on Thanksgiving is worth a small holiday bonus on top of a modest base wage. Whether it's worth not pissing off the boss and maybe losing hours in the future. Or whether it's worth helping a colleague save their own holiday with family.The retailers taking part in Black Friday ""creep"" may be excited about the shopping bacchanalia. But the workers? The ones who emailed HuffPost with their thoughts didn't sound too pumped about the whole affair. They're not fired up by the prospect of a one-day pay differential, or a free meal in the break room. Mostly, they just seem sad.   A manager from Office Depot, who like other workers asked that her name not be used for fear of getting in trouble with her boss, will be cutting her holiday short on Thursday. Many Office Depots will be opening on Thanksgiving this year.We will be open from 8 pm til 11 pm. It's only three hours but it's three hours too many… Thanksgiving is a day that should be spent at home, enjoying time off, or spending time with your loved ones. It makes me sad that retail locations value sales more than their associates these days... Why can't shopping wait til Friday? It's just one day. But in the world of retail no one thinks about families or considers the little people who have to be at work. All they care about is sales.Perhaps most depressing for career employees is the knowledge that opening times only move in one direction. For some workers, it has started to set in that they may never enjoy a normal Thanksgiving again. And as much as the retail giants would like to point fingers at their competitors, or say they're just following the demands of shoppers, plenty of workers view this development as nothing more than a moral failing of corporate leadership.A manager who's worked at Best Buy for more than 10 years -- and who will miss the holiday with her children this week -- says she is quitting and this Black Friday will be her last:The company has changed in many ways. I understand that we have had to in multiple ways with the ever changing retail climate, and to keep customers and Wall Street happy. The disappointing downfall is that Best Buy always used to say that they cared for the employee and for our families. That they would refuse to open to give teams time with their families, which is a rare thing to have in retail. Granted I understand the quote they say to us over and over: ""you choose retail, retail did not choose you."" The decision to open on Thanksgiving just seems like greed has won over and the idea of care and family are long gone.And it can be awful working a Black Friday sale. Shoppers who've waited hours and even days on line in the cold can be a prickly bunch. It isn't unheard of for workers to get hurt or even killed in all the excitement. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration -- an agency better associated with factory explosions -- has even issued guidelines for retailers on how to reduce the odds of workers getting hurt in a melee.One of the roughly 1 million Walmart workers who will be on duty Thursday explained to HuffPost why she's careful to wear an extra shirt beneath her Walmart uniform:I have worked the Thanksgiving madness before and let me tell you it is scary. People will start showing up and camping out in the aisles four hours or more before the sales start. They get aggressive and in your face… Most of us wear another shirt under our Walmart shirt so we can take off our Walmart shirt when our shift is over. Otherwise, we will never get out of the store in one piece.Another Walmart employee said she'll be working a total of 14 hours, spread over two shifts, between Wednesday evening and Friday morning. (Many Walmarts are open throughout the day on Thanksgiving, though the Black Friday sale doesn't start until evening.)My family doesn’t get Thanksgiving at all this year, because I am the only one to cook. We have no family or friends that we can go to who will do the cooking for us. My husband works at a gas station and only has to work 4 hours that day. The three of us very rarely get time where we all have off together, so having to work on Thanksgiving makes me angry. Spending time with the people I love means something to me.A lot of retailers would say the shifts are going to the workers who want them. That may be true in some cases, especially for workers who want more hours on the schedule. But for many, working the holiday isn't a choice at all. The stores will be open, and someone has to staff them. Dick's Sporting Goods will be open at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving. A Dick's worker in Wisconsin said she found out a week ago that she needs to be at the store at 7:30 p.m., right around apple-pie time:A customer said it perfectly to me the other day that ""each year it's going to get earlier and earlier, and sooner or later all retail workers will be asked to work thanksgiving."" This is terrible. I find myself asking what I can do to stop this. I need a job, so quitting is unrealistic.There have been people who've had to work on Thanksgiving for as long as it's been a holiday. A lot of them perform essential services: cops, firefighters, nurses. Although less critical, plenty of gas stations, grocery stores and news outlets like this one will expect a few selfless employees to make sacrifices, too. A few retailers do choose to forgo the extra hours and preserve their employees' holiday. For some of the workers who aren't as lucky, the toughest part isn't trudging into work on Thanksgiving -- it's mustering the very gratitude the holiday is meant to instill. One Walmart worker wrote:I will try to be thankful that in this economy I am lucky enough to have any job, but when my kids are eating macaroni and cheese every night and I can't even spend Thanksgiving with them, it doesn't always help. When my kids tell me they don't need a big turkey on Thanksgiving and they don't want anything for Christmas, they just want me to be with me, it's hard to be thankful."
2,TECH,6 Things To Keep In Mind While Shopping On Amazon Black Friday,Dino Grandoni,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-shopping_us_5bb36c85e4b0fa920b986e13,"If you plan on looking for online deals this Black Friday -- and if 2013 is anything like 2012, more than 57 million Americans",2013-11-28,"**FILE** In this Dec. 1, 2008 file photo, an Amazon.com employee grabs boxes off the conveyor belt to load in a truck at their Fernley, Nev., warehouse. Amazon.com Inc. said Friday, Dec. 26, 2008, that the 2008 holiday season was the online retailer's ""best ever,"" with more than 6.3 million items ordered and 5.6 million units shipped during its peak day on Dec. 15. (AP Photo/Scott Sady, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb36c852400005100975c09.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you plan on looking for online deals this Black Friday -- and if 2013 is anything like 2012, more than 57 million Americans will -- you’ll likely visit a little website called Amazon.com. From the outside, the world’s largest online store works like magic: Click a button and in few days, some chosen item will miraculously show up at your doorstep.But unlike the greeters at Walmart or the cashiers at Target, you’ll likely never meet the men and women who box your Amazon order at one of the company's gargantuan warehouses across the globe. And Amazon may prefer it that way, since its online prices end up having huge costs. A few things to keep in mind this shopping season:1. Warehouse workers are treated like robots.Your boss may be bad. But your supervisor probably isn't a piece of equipment that times you as you complete menial tasks. This week, the BBC described the experience of one of its undercover reporters, Adam Littler:A handset told him what to collect and put on his trolley. It allotted him a set number of seconds to find each product and counted down. If he made a mistake the scanner beeped. ""We strongly refute the charge that Amazon exploits its employees in any way,"" the company said in a statement responding to the BBC report.2. Amazon doesn’t pay workers for every hour they work.To make sure low-wage warehouse workers don't steal any merchandise, Amazon makes them pass through security checkpoints. Here’s what one Nevada worker experienced:Whenever he clocked out after his 12-hour shift at an Amazon warehouse, Jesse Busk had one more critical task to perform before he could hop into his car and head home to sleep: Pass through the sprawling warehouse security checkpoint.Amazon has declined to comment on worker lawsuits over the lost pay.3. Warehouses are so big that workers waste their lunch hour just walking to the cafeteria.Again, from the Nevada warehouse:According to the lawsuit, the facilities they worked at were each the size of seven football fields. On an unpaid lunch break, Busk said he might spend half the time just trying to get to and from the area where workers eat.An image from the warehouse, to get a sense of how big we're talking:Amazon has declined to comment on the issue.4. Sometimes warehouses are so hot, people pass out.The now famous case occurred in an eastern Pennsylvanian warehouse. The Morning Call, the daily newspaper in Allentown, Pa., tells the tale of warehouse employee Elmer Goris:The 34-year-old Allentown resident, who has worked in warehouses for more than 10 years, said he quit in July because he was frustrated with the heat and demands that he work mandatory overtime. Working conditions at the warehouse got worse earlier this year, especially during summer heat waves when heat in the warehouse soared above 100 degrees, he said.Only many months later did the paper report that air conditioning had been installed.Amazon told The Morning Call in 2012 that new warehouses would be air conditioned and old ones would be retrofitted.5. Amazon lets former workers go without unemployment benefits.The Allentown newspaper stayed on Amazon's case, uncovering in 2012 that Integrity Staffing Solutions, the temp work agency Amazon uses to staff its warehouses, takes pains to make sure former employees can't collect unemployment benefits:Months after she suffered heat exhaustion and lost her job in an Amazon.com warehouse in Breinigsville, Rosemarie Fritchman sat in a small conference room pleading for unemployment benefits of about $160 a week.Amazon has declined to address its staffing provider's unemployment disputes.6. Amazon hates unions.Each of the above are really symptoms of one larger problem. Amazon executives categorically oppose the idea of warehouse workers organizing because they fear that unions would slow the speedy deliveries that have become the staple of the Amazon shopping experience. From The New York Times:Dave Clark, the company’s vice president of worldwide operations and customer service, says Amazon views unions as intermediaries that will want to have a say on everything from employee scheduling to changes in processes for handling and packaging orders. Amazon prizes its ability to quickly introduce changes like these into its warehouses to improve the experience of its customers, he said.In Germany, Amazon employees are actually striking this holiday season:"

Russia had held 30 crew members of the Arctic Sunrise for over two months after activists in September scaled an oil rig in the Barents Sea owned by energy giant Gazprom. Hearings on whether to detain the so called of the 'Arctic 30' for a further three months of pre-trial detention were set to continue this week. AFP PHOTO / OLGA MALTSEVA (Photo credit should read OLGA MALTSEVA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb14bae260000e9008181fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After two months in a Russian jail, American Greenpeace activist Peter Willcox will spend Thanksgiving free on bail. But he's still not allowed to come home.Willcox spoke to The Huffington Post from Saint Petersburg, where he has been told he will have to wait for up to three months while the Russian government considers what charges to press against him and 29 other Greenpeace activists arrested Sept. 19 while protesting at a Gazprom oil platform in the Arctic. All 30 of the protesters are now free on bail. ""I'm feeling really good,"" Willcox said Wednesday, less than a week after he was granted bail and allowed to leave Murmansk, where the activists had been jailed for two months. He is the only American in the group which Greenpeace calls the ""Arctic 30."" ""I'm optimistic. Our lawyers feel there's a very small chance of us going back to jail.""Whether I'm home for Christmas or not is anybody's guess,"" Willcox said, ""but I think I'll be home sometime soon at least.""The Russian government has charged Willcox, captain of Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise ship, and the other activists with  hooliganism (the same offense that landed two members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot in prison). A conviction for hooliganism could land the Arctic 30 in jail for up to seven years. That's still better than the initial charge, piracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years. ""The piracy charges have not been dropped, but they seem to be way on the back burner,"" Willcox said.Willcox, 60, has worked with Greenpeace for more than 30 years. He was captain of the Rainbow Warrior when the French foreign intelligence service sank it in New Zealand in 1985. He said he was arrested and charged with piracy in Peru in 1982, when activists boarded a Japanese whaling boat and chained themselves to the harpoon gun. The charges were dropped. ""This was the first time, ever, that I had been held for more than one night in a jail,"" said Willcox. Willcox said he and his crew were surprised when the Russian coast guard seized their ship. ""We had done an action [in Russia] last year, pretty much the same action -- even a little more aggressive. And there was no drama. They stood by, watching. We finished the action. There was no damage to the rig. But we got our photograph and we went away. That's what we were expecting to do this time.""The weeks after the arrest were trying. ""I wasn't allowed to talk to my lawyer for the first month I was in jail. I just didn’t know what was going on,"" said Willcox. All the Greenpeace activists were held in separate cells, he said. They got one hour a day in an exercise area under a leaky roof, Willcox said, ""so you couldn't even see the sky."" But they could yell over the top of the walls and talk to each other. At night, prisoners would pass notes outside the windows, using a string to pull socks filled with written messages.""You're anxious, you're nervous. Frankly, you're scared,"" said Willcox. Until the activists knew the piracy charge would be relaxed, they were even more worried. Willcox said he feared he would never see his parents again, as his father is 94. Young women worried they may miss an opportunity to have children. Willcox cited his own children as a reason he is willing to risk arrest for climate activism. He has two daughters, ages 18 and 22, as well as a 27-year-old stepson. ""I'm deeply concerned for their futures,"" he said.Even now, he said he'd do the Arctic protest again, knowing he'd spend two months in jail. ""I mean, for me, I didn't like two months in jail,"" he said. ""It was really tough. But for me, the alternative -- doing nothing, giving up the planet to the oil companies -- is not an option. If I have to go to jail for a couple of months, I'll do that. That's a price to pay. Ten to 15 years is another matter.""Willcox said the ordeal in Russia has not turned him away from direct action. ""I am not going to back down,"" said Willcox. ""The problems of climate change are so significant, so stressful. I'm not going to stop doing what I'm doing.""This article was updated to reflect the fact that Colin Russell, the last of the Arctic 30 jailed in Russia, was granted bail on Thursday morning."

Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb14baf2400005100553ac2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The holiday shopping season officially kicks off on Black Friday, and so begins that annual hunt for the perfect present, at the best price -- and with the fewest poisons.Store shelves, as consumers have been warned, can be filled with everything from lead-contaminated jewelry and toys, to hormone-disrupting perfumes and lotions. Just in the last month, watchdog groups reported finding potentially toxic levels of phthalates in Spongebob Squarepants vinyl rain ponchos and flame retardants in Toys R Us furniture. And let's not forget the neurotoxic lead and other chemicals that leach from some fake plastic Christmas trees.Despite growing recognition of toxic dangers that may lurk in consumer products, avoiding these chemicals is another story. Advocates continue to lament weak and outdated federal regulation of toxic chemicals, even though they cheer incremental gains, such as California's announcement last week that furniture manufacturers will no longer be required to fill their foam with flame retardants starting in January. The controversial chemicals are the subject of an award-winning Chicago Tribune series and a documentary, ""Toxic Hot Seat,"" which premiered Monday on HBO. (In light of this news, people with furniture on their holiday shopping lists may want to consider gifting an IOU.) ""Right now, the dangers are invisible, unlabeled, and a consumer has no basis for making a reasonable and health-protected choice,"" said John Wargo, an environmental health expert at Yale University. ""The onus is on the consumer, who needs to do research product by product,"" he added. ""People don't have time for that and often opt for buying whatever is available.""Some environmental groups are now attempting to make navigating around toxic chemicals easier for concerned shoppers, with a fleet of new consumer guides and mobile apps.A website launched in September, SafeMarkets.org, provides information, tips and resources, such as HealthyStuff.org's database of more than 5,000 tested consumer products. The new site from the Workgroup for Safe Markets, a collaboration of environmental groups, links to other sites, including a new nontoxic shopping guide published by Women's Voices for the Earth and Greenpeace's electronics buying guide. An increasing number of tools are also available for shoppers on the go. Mobile product-rating apps from the Good Guide and the nonprofit Environmental Working Group allow users to simply scan a barcode. The latter, launched in mid-November, offers iPhone and Android versions of its Skin Deep database, which contains data on about 80,000 cosmetic and personal care products. ""A lot of people are surprised when they start scanning,"" said Heather White, executive director of the Environmental Working Group. The average American uses 10 to 12 personal care products a day, totaling some 126 different ingredients. Among the most critical ingredients to avoid due to their hormone-mimicking, cancer-causing, antibiotic-resistance-promoting or development-disturbing properties, according to White, are parabens, formaldehyde, triclosan, polyethylene, phthalates and ""fragrance.""Fragrance formulas are protected as ""trade secrets,"" so their ingredients are rarely disclosed. White noted that the additives often include phthalates. Research published in November added an increased risk of preterm birth to the list of phthalates' potential health hazards. ""Lip gloss, mascara, perfume. They are popular stocking stuffers,"" White added. ""But there are some serious concerns being raised each day.""An app very similar to Environmental Working Group's is available for mobile phones called Think Dirty. Launched in October, its database includes close to 14,000 products -- primarily ""best sellers,"" according to founder and CEO Lily Tse.A comparison of the two apps by The Huffington Post showed significant differences between scores on the same products. Edge sensitive skin shave gel, for example, rated 4 out of 10 on Environmental Working Group's app, and 10 out of 10 on Tse's. Higher values mean greater toxicities, according to both scales.Tse suggested the discrepancy reflects differing philosophies on toxic chemical exposures. ""For myself and many others with chemical sensitivity, it's important to stay away if a certain chemical is present, regardless of how much of it is there,"" said Tse. In this case, the presence of PEG-90M, triethanolamine and fragrance put the shave gel in the red. Tse's advice for the holidays: Minimize fragrance use to protect yourself and others around you who may be chemically sensitive. ""You don't need to overload to show holiday spirit,"" she said.Perhaps no sight or smell represents the holiday spirit more than a Christmas tree. But the season staple isn't without chemical dangers, from pesticides at tree farms to lead and phthalates found in fake plastic versions and on the lights traditionally strung across branches.Yale's Wargo said he will likely be on the hunt for a Christmas tree this holiday weekend. ""I can't bring myself to buy a fake tree. We go to a tree farm every year,"" he said, choosing one that runs sustainably, without pesticides. Still, Wargo's family falls short of avoiding chemical dangers. He recalled shopping for an extension cord the other day and seeing the ubiquitous warning label for lead. He said he uses old Christmas lights that are also likely contaminated.Mike Schade of the nonprofit Center for Health, Environment and Justice, who helped create the SafeMarkets.org website, emphasized the health hazards associated with PVC, also know as vinyl, used widely in fake Christmas trees, lights and in products wrapped and put under trees. He called PVC the ""poison plastic.""""From production to use, to disposal, it releases harmful chemicals that are building up in our bodies and are linked to chronic health problems on rise,"" Schade said, listing links to cancer, learning disabilities and obesity, among other conditions. He noted that heat from lights can encourage chemical additives to leach out.Phthalates and lead are among chemicals that have been commonly added to PVC to soften and stabilize the plastic. While some companies have eliminated those chemicals, scientists are finding that organotins and other replacement additives may be toxic, too.""We don't want to be a grinch,"" Schade said. ""We just recommend consumers avoid purchasing trees, toys or infant products made of PVC, even if they are labeled lead or phthalate-free.""A potential red flag are items imported from China, added Schade. Several such products have been found in recent years to be contaminated with lead or elevated phthalates. ""But just because it's made in the U.S., doesn't mean it's necessarily safe,"" Schade said. ""Our chemical safety system is broken.""Even the patches in place to help protect consumers, advocates warned, are far from foolproof.While laws restrict certain chemicals from products aimed at younger children, for example, Penelope Jagessar Chaffer warned that parents also need to be cautious about what they bring into the home for older members of their family. Play jewelry gifted to a teen girl, for example, may find its way into the hands and mouth of a more vulnerable little sister or brother.Jagessar Chaffer is the director of the film ""Toxic Baby,"" which will be released next year as an innovative iPad app with additional footage, an interactive map of toxic sites across the country and an encyclopedia of information on toxic chemicals. One of the awards for pledging to her soon-to-launch Kickstarter crowdsourcing campaign will be a toxic audit -- available for Christmas or New Year's. ""People do tend to buy a lot from Black Friday onward,"" said Jagessar Chaffer. ""I can help them navigate what presents to get, what they bring into their home.""She added that if people plan to purchase big-ticket items during after-Christmas sales, she can also help them manage toxicity levels or even decide if now is the time to buy an air filter or HEPA vacuum. It's this rise and dispersal of information that experts and advocates said they believe is the key to solving our toxic chemical woes.Wargo likened it to the evolution of organic food. That was caused, he said, by ""widescale recognition among consumers that pesticides are potentially dangerous.""""As more people are educated, our hope is that they'll take action to move the market,"" said Environmental Working Group's White. ""As the market changes, we hope the political climate changes -- giving more hope for revising our outdated law."" ""We can't shop our way out of this problem,"" White added."

The only turkey on my Thanksgiving table is a bottle of Wild Turkey bourbon. It's next to the photo of Olivia, my first turkey love.I met Olivia in the year 2000, when I visited the Poplar Spring Farm Animal Sanctuary. Having fallen for Babe, the movie star, I thought I was there to meet the pigs. But the sanctuary owner, Terry, started our tour at the turkey coop and changed my life.Terry opened the gate, and Olivia hobbled toward me -- ""hobbled"" because the ends of her toes had been cut off. Terry explained that turkeys on factory farms are crammed so close together that their claws and beaks injure each other's lucrative flesh, and it's cheaper to cut them off than to give the animals enough space. I learned that such practices are legal because the Animal Welfare Act, which regulates housing, exempts animals used for food, and animal cruelty laws exempt any ""standard agricultural practice"" no matter how painful. I learned that turkeys are not even covered under federal humane slaughter laws; no poultry is, even though birds make up approximately 95 percent of animals slaughtered for food.More happily I learned that turkeys love to be cuddled. As I sat cross-legged on the grassy hill near the coop, Olivia limped in my direction. First she came close enough for me to reach out and touch her -- gingerly. Then she moved further in, and I could pet her. It was surprisingly like petting my dog.I reached my fingers under the outer feathers on her back and could feel a layer of soft down underneath. I had only ever felt that down in luxury pillows. How odd and lovely to feel it warm on a living being.Within a couple of minutes, Olivia had edged herself into my lap! I continued to move my fingers through her down. She laid her head in the crook of my elbow. She fell asleep. I fell in love.I wished I could take her home with me, but I settled for sponsoring her at the sanctuary.Olivia showed remarkable longevity for a modern turkey. Bred to be deformed, with a grotesquely huge chest for lots of ""white meat,"" she'd been too weak to stand when she had arrived at the sanctuary. But apparently a home with space to move, grass to enjoy, sunshine in which to bathe, and loving care had given her the will to live. And live she did, happily, until 2005, when I received the sad news that the sanctuary's lovely little turkey ambassador, my little ward, had died of cancer.In Olivia's honor I started to sponsor a new turkey every Thanksgiving. Then, in 2008, I brought two to my home, saved from the local slaughter industry, in order to do a bit of media work. Now I can't imagine ""Turkey Day"" without live turkeys.They come to me pretty stinky, often covered in excrement from their cagemates, so that's why they get a bath. And while the blow dry might make you think I missed my calling as a hairdresser, it's actually a necessity. Turkeys are waterproof; their beautiful soft down is protected by thick outer feathers, which hinder both water and airflow, so if you are going to wash the layers underneath, you have to blow-dry them or they just won't dry.Anne and Jessica are in better shape than most turkeys. They have obviously come from a free-range farm, as they still have their beaks and toes, which is rare.But their intended fate was no better than that of the other 45 million turkeys killed for Thanksgiving, so it sure is lovely to hear from the front yard, as I type this, their sweet and very alive turkey noises.They are so affectionate. My video shows them calling out from the front door, and this morning, before I had a chance to put up the barrier, they marched right in. As I tried to usher them out, Jessica just sat down and wouldn't budge. They really are just like dogs. The neighborhood kids are getting that message, and I know that ""tofurky"" sales have been up at the local supermarket since I started doing my annual turkey rescue.In December we'll take Anne and Jessica up to the Animal Place sanctuary in northern California, where they'll live out their lives as ambassadors, entertaining children and teaching them that turkeys, like all animals, just want to be loved. I hope that people touched by this little tale will sponsor them and all the other wonderful animals at Animal Place.Mostly I hope that people will keep in mind that ""Turkey Day"" can be a lot more fun when the turkeys are alive and well.UPDATE: Annie and Jessica ended up going not to Animal Place but to Farm Sanctuary in Orland, California.

8,ENVIRONMENT,Controversial GMO Study By Gilles-Eric Seralini Retracted,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gmo-study-seralini-retracted_us_5bb14bb1e4b09bbe9a5defec,"Seralini, who works in Caen with a group called CRIIGEN, the Committee for Research and Independent Information on Genetic",2013-11-28,"French professor Gilles-Eric Seralini gives a press conference on November 28, 2013 at EU headquarters in Brussels to denounce the removal by the Food and Chemical Toxicology review of his study published in September 2012 on the effects of genetically-modified maize fed to rats. Seralini, an expert in molecular biology at Caen University in France, claimed in the study that rats fed a diet of genitically-modified maize, or exposed to glyphosate, for two years, developed higher levels of cancers and died earlier than others. AFP PHOTO/ JOHN THYS (Photo credit should read JOHN THYS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb14bb12100006401c72b9c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kate KellandLONDON (Reuters) - The publisher of a controversial and much-criticized study suggesting genetically modified corn caused tumors in rats has withdrawn the paper after a year-long investigation found it did not meet scientific standards.Reed Elsevier's Food and Chemical Toxicology (FCT)journal, which published the study by the French researcher Gilles-Eric Seralini in September 2012, said the retraction was because the study's small sample size meant no definitive conclusions could be reached.""This retraction comes after a thorough and time-consuming analysis of the published article and the data it reports, along with an investigation into the peer-review behind the article,"" the journal said in a statement.""Ultimately, the results presented - while not incorrect - are inconclusive, and therefore do not reach the threshold of publication for Food and Chemical Toxicology.""At the time of its original publication, hundreds of scientists across the world questioned Seralini's research, which said rats fed Monsanto's GM corn had suffered tumors and multiple organ failure.The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued a statement in November 2012 saying the study by Seralini, who was based at France's University of Caen, had serious defects in design and methodology and did not meet acceptable scientific standards.Within weeks of its appearance in the peer-reviewed journal, more than 700 scientists had signed an online petition calling on Seralini to release all the data from his research.In its retraction statement, the FCT said that, in light of these concerns, it too had asked to view the raw data.Seralini ""agreed and supplied all material that was requested by the editor-in-chief"", it said.The journal said that, while it had received many letters expressing concerns about the validity of the findings, the proper use of animals and even allegations of fraud, its own investigation found ""no evidence of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the data"".""However, there is a legitimate cause for concern regarding both the number of animals in each study group and the particular strain selected,"" it said.Seralini, who works in Caen with a group called CRIIGEN, the Committee for Research and Independent Information on Genetic Engineering, said the journal's criticisms of his work were ""unacceptable"".""Were FCT to persist in its decision to retract our study, CRIIGEN would attack with lawyers, including in the United States, to require financial compensation for the huge damage to our group,"" he said in a statement.Other scientists, however, welcomed the journal's decision, although some said it had come too late.""The major flaws in this paper make its retraction the right thing to do,"" said Cathie Martin, a professor at John Innes Centre. ""The strain of rats used is highly susceptible to tumors after 18 months with or without GMO (genetically modified organisms) in their diets.""David Spiegelhalter, a professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, said it was ""clear from even a superficial reading that this paper was not fit for publication"". In this instance, he said, the peer review process had not worked properly.""But at least this has now been remedied and the journal has recognized that no conclusions can be drawn from this study, so I suppose it is better late than never,"" he said.(Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Kevin Liffey and Anthony Barker)"

For one thing, the owners of the home -- Martine and Alexandre Penet -- are champagne makers. Alexandre's family has been making champagne for generations. Their eight-year-old daughter, shy in the face of non-French speaking strangers, wanders, in and out and I offer suggestions to Martine of gifts Alexandre can bring back from Chicago where he's just left on business.Chris Rooth, an Englishman, has brought us here. Along with his partner, he operates a small company called La Vigne u Roi that wants to encourage visitors to appreciate more than the major champagne makers like Taittinger and Pimmery, and more than the famous Reims Cathedral dating back to the 13th Century where many kings were crowned and a symbol of France during the searing battles of World War One, many right around here. Chris tells us that before Paris was a city, Reims was the center of activity in this region.Martine Penet serves delicious chicken dish cooked in ChampagneThere are 15,000 growers here and 5,000 producers. Some own patches of vines no larger than a tennis court -- or several parcels tennis court size, he explains as we look down on the orderly rows of vines glorious in the fall colors from the top of a crest of a hill.It's the chalk in the soil that makes this such ideal growing area for the chardonnay and pinot noir grapes that are used for champagne. ""All about the Chalk,"" Chris says, explaining it is a natural sponge that keeps the water in the soil and ends the minerality to the grapes. Montagne de Reims stretches for 12 miles around the city where the grapes are grown on the hillsides. They are also grown in Epernay in some 281,000 parcels of land.""Champagne is all about the blending,"" Chris explains. The vineyards are scattered all over the place...and most are family owned. There are around 12,000 labels of champagne.He takes us to meet 36-year-old Nicolas Maillart in the Village of Ecueil who is the ninth generation of his family to be making wine here since 1753 -- he took over from his father when he was just 26 -- and has growing reputation for achieving the highest potential of the vine. His champagnes taste delicious!Chris Rooth demonstrates riddling champagne wine  Chris shows us the Maillart operation from the mostly 21st Century machines, the huge vats where the wine is fermented, the cages where the bottles are turned to get out the sediment. This process called riddling used to have to be done by hand, with the bottles put in wooden holes on a large board. These vats can hold nearly 14,000 bottles -- all of the wine from one parcel of land. Later they are put in big oak barrels that have come from BurgundyThen it's all about the blending -- that's when the chemistry and the art come in.Let's not forget about those famous bubbles. That's the result of the yeast and sugar and carbon dioxide that is trapped in the bottle. These bottles might remain in the cave five years or more. We look around at all of the bottles in this high tech cave -- over 6 million euros worth!As we taste his champagne, Nicolas Maillart comes by to say hello. ""You have to be respectful of the grapes,"" he says, explaining that it is only in the last 60 years or so champagne has even been drunk by more than royalty and very wealthy people.Nicolas MaillartBut it's always been a wine of celebration. That's probably because Reims is where numerous French Kings were crowned dating back centuries into the 13th Century cathedral and they drank -- what else -- the wine of Champagne -- to celebrate afterwards... but centuries ago, the wine was still wine. We learn about Brut and extra Brut...about Vintage (only when it is a particularly good year) and non vintage.We taste six kinds of Maillart Champagne. It is so delicious we have to send some home.On a tour like this, meeting the producers themselves, having lunch in their home, of course you get a much better sense of the tradition and the people who work so hard to produce champagne. This is so much better than just going in to a large tasting room.Cathedral in Reims heavily damaged in World War IBut we also learn about all the World Wars history here. Reims was bombarded by German artillery for more than three years during World War I, virtually reducing it to rubble. Restoration work is still going on at the famous Cathedral. During World War II, Eisenhower's headquarters after Normandy was in a school here; it is here where the Germans surrendered.Everywhere in these villages, it seems, we pass World War I cemeteries -- French, Italian, British and German. Villages were entirely destroyed, all of their young men lost, Rooth tells us. He points out where were the front lines -- how men arriving on trains to fight could go underground from the train station in Reims to the trenches and battlefields.We stop in one village to see a monument -- like one in every village -- to the young men who were lost. There are pictures of some and the same names -- brothers and cousins, we're guessing. Some 10,000 are buried in one cemetery -- thousands more in another -- neat rows of white crosses with a Jewish star interspersed here and there. The loss is breathtaking.I always knew champagne was for celebrations but until now, I didn't know why or appreciate how much effort -- how much sweat, tears and family history -- it takes to create that bottle of bubbles. It's inconceivable to me that this other world of France -- of rolling fields and tiny villages are just a 40-minute high-speed train ride from Paris.A word about the train -- Rooth advised buying your tickets as soon as you know you plan to visit as high speed train tickets, like flights, fluctuate with demands. Tickets can be had for as little as 30-40 Euros; my cousins who booked last minute, paid 100 Euros per ticket.I had a French Rail Pass which meant I made a reservation on the train and then paid just $11 each way, plus a service fee. But I forgot to bring our passport numbers to put on the Rail Pass. Going from Paris, they didn't even check our tickets; on the return, the conductor wanted to charge me $164 Euros. He ultimately decided to charge me $20 but when I got to Paris, I went to the ticket office at the train station to see what the charge was for -- apparently, I was supposed to get my ticket stamped before I got to the train. I didn't know that of course.The kind train agent returned my 20 Euros. ""Just don't do it again,"" he said with a smile. When we left Martine Penet's home, armed with the recipe for the chicken cooked in champagne, we kissed and I invited them to come to lunch at our house next time they are visiting New York. I hope they do.Meanwhile, when we get home, we've got the champagne that will help us remember.-------- Eileen Ogintz writes the widely syndicated column Taking the Kids™ and is the creator of www.takingthekids.com.

His champagnes taste delicious!Chris Rooth demonstrates riddling champagne wine  Chris shows us the Maillart operation from the mostly 21st Century machines, the huge vats where the wine is fermented, the cages where the bottles are turned to get out the sediment. This process called riddling used to have to be done by hand, with the bottles put in wooden holes on a large board. These vats can hold nearly 14,000 bottles -- all of the wine from one parcel of land. Later they are put in big oak barrels that have come from BurgundyThen it's all about the blending -- that's when the chemistry and the art come in.Let's not forget about those famous bubbles. That's the result of the yeast and sugar and carbon dioxide that is trapped in the bottle. These bottles might remain in the cave five years or more. We look around at all of the bottles in this high tech cave -- over 6 million euros worth!As we taste his champagne, Nicolas Maillart comes by to say hello. ""You have to be respectful of the grapes,"" he says, explaining that it is only in the last 60 years or so champagne has even been drunk by more than royalty and very wealthy people.Nicolas MaillartBut it's always been a wine of celebration. That's probably because Reims is where numerous French Kings were crowned dating back centuries into the 13th Century cathedral and they drank -- what else -- the wine of Champagne -- to celebrate afterwards... but centuries ago, the wine was still wine. We learn about Brut and extra Brut...about Vintage (only when it is a particularly good year) and non vintage.We taste six kinds of Maillart Champagne. It is so delicious we have to send some home.On a tour like this, meeting the producers themselves, having lunch in their home, of course you get a much better sense of the tradition and the people who work so hard to produce champagne. This is so much better than just going in to a large tasting room.Cathedral in Reims heavily damaged in World War IBut we also learn about all the World Wars history here. Reims was bombarded by German artillery for more than three years during World War I, virtually reducing it to rubble. Restoration work is still going on at the famous Cathedral. During World War II, Eisenhower's headquarters after Normandy was in a school here; it is here where the Germans surrendered.Everywhere in these villages, it seems, we pass World War I cemeteries -- French, Italian, British and German. Villages were entirely destroyed, all of their young men lost, Rooth tells us. He points out where were the front lines -- how men arriving on trains to fight could go underground from the train station in Reims to the trenches and battlefields.We stop in one village to see a monument -- like one in every village -- to the young men who were lost. There are pictures of some and the same names -- brothers and cousins, we're guessing. Some 10,000 are buried in one cemetery -- thousands more in another -- neat rows of white crosses with a Jewish star interspersed here and there. The loss is breathtaking.I always knew champagne was for celebrations but until now, I didn't know why or appreciate how much effort -- how much sweat, tears and family history -- it takes to create that bottle of bubbles. It's inconceivable to me that this other world of France -- of rolling fields and tiny villages are just a 40-minute high-speed train ride from Paris.A word about the train -- Rooth advised buying your tickets as soon as you know you plan to visit as high speed train tickets, like flights, fluctuate with demands. Tickets can be had for as little as 30-40 Euros; my cousins who booked last minute, paid 100 Euros per ticket.I had a French Rail Pass which meant I made a reservation on the train and then paid just $11 each way, plus a service fee. But I forgot to bring our passport numbers to put on the Rail Pass. Going from Paris, they didn't even check our tickets; on the return, the conductor wanted to charge me $164 Euros. He ultimately decided to charge me $20 but when I got to Paris, I went to the ticket office at the train station to see what the charge was for -- apparently, I was supposed to get my ticket stamped before I got to the train. I didn't know that of course.The kind train agent returned my 20 Euros. ""Just don't do it again,"" he said with a smile. When we left Martine Penet's home, armed with the recipe for the chicken cooked in champagne, we kissed and I invited them to come to lunch at our house next time they are visiting New York. I hope they do.Meanwhile, when we get home, we've got the champagne that will help us remember.-------- Eileen Ogintz writes the widely syndicated column Taking the Kids™ and is the creator of www.takingthekids.com.

Ostensibly the device was to let me stay in touch with my husband back home while I explored Marrakech with a friend. It turned out to be the first block in a barricade I'd build between myself and the art of travel. I wrote in my blog later:Morocco was an entirely new world. It's an assault on all my senses and a test of my reflexes. The scent of mint and cumin compete with diesel fumes. Scooters bearing families of four buzz by within millimeters of my elbow - I leap out of the way, careful not to trip on the uneven cobblestone or step in front of that horse or donkey whose clip-clopping hooves can't be heard in the hubbub. The call to prayer tries to rise above the melee of the souk proprietors calling me to their store, the trill of the snake charmers, and the little boys asking where I'm going so they can lead me there for a few dirhams. ... Henna tattoo artists and clinking water sellers give way to night. The cacophony that would overwhelm me elsewhere energizes me here. But even amidst all this, my eyes continually strayed to the little screen in my hand. I posted dozens of photos to Facebook and waited for comments. Morocco was the most compelling world I'd ever entered, yet Facebook had more allure. It's been a downward spiral since. Riding camels in the Sahara, my silhouette on the silver sands came complete with phone in hand -- the better to chronicle the experience. Head tilted back in northern Thailand to marvel at thousands of lanterns soaring into the night sky during Loy Krathong, my view came through the camera screen on my phone. Scrabbling through the pungent dirt of a remote swath of Italy learning a truffle dog's secrets, I paused repeatedly the better to get just the right angle on a photo of the dog's snout emerging from the earth. Great pictures? Pretty good. People on Facebook liked them, and on Instagram too when that came along. But really? Really, is that why I got on the plane? A trip to Vietnam last year ignited an awakening -- to the realities of the world, to my shortfalls as a traveler. But even as I struggled to process the experience enough to write anything in my notebook, tap, tap, tap, I shot one cell phone photo after another. And just like that everyone back home could see exotic Saigon for themselves. Look! Dana with pho! But they couldn't know from those photos what I felt. I wrote later, from home: ... amidst the searing heat and frenzy and disappointment in myself were glimmers of joy, little pieces of Vietnam I could grab hold of to love. An inky black iced coffee poured over creamy sweetened condensed milk. A little boy running out as we zipped by his Cat Ba home on scooters, to give Brian a high five. The giggles of women who wanted to ask questions about my hair, so unlike theirs. The gnarled old lady who didn't have the exact right change for the cutting boards I bought who just gave me chopsticks instead. The cold bliss of fresh coconut juice. The perfection of a banh mi from the guy on the corner. The surreal moment when the monk in a temple at the end of a dirt road on the banks of the Saigon River read my future and told me to be calm, just calm down.  No faux-nostalgic photo on Instagram could speak to the maelstrom of feelings that traveling Vietnam sparked inside me. So why did I spend so much time attempting to document our experience with photos? I could say I was too overwhelmed to write, and that's partly true. Aside from scribblings like ""poisonous snakes are always cooked with papaya"" my notebook contained little more than addresses and lists because I couldn't process what I was experiencing. But really it was just laziness. It was easier, far easier, to snap a photo as a memory aid than to force myself to connect enough with the situation to write down the details. And as much as I wanted to hang on to the barrage of stimuli and the thoughts tumbling through my head to mull over later, I killed that option bit by bit with every tap on the screen. I couldn't resist the profound urge to capture the experience -- I just went about it the wrong way.Not every traveler falls prey to this temptation. Paul Theroux rarely takes photos. When I had the fantastic privilege of interviewing him, I asked him why.""When you take pictures something in your brain shuts off,"" he answered. ""When you don't take pictures you look very hard and you study the scene and you remember.""And some people get this. Travel writer Robert Reid, who fessed up to ""rushing like a Black Friday shopper to spread news of [his] travels in real time"" said in his recent National Geographic Traveler piece The Secret to Remembering Travel, ""The key to maximizing future memories, then, is to simply be present, to pay attention to the details that interest you, to look at them closely.""This made me wonder. When did I last remember to be present and pay attention? It had to be on the first trip my husband and I took overseas -- a month in Europe in 2001. The only one where we had -- between the two of us -- one camera. A film camera. It offered no instant gratification. The film was costly. We used it sparingly (relatively speaking to today when we travel with a smart phone each plus a heavy duty digital SLR and a GoPro). And I wrote feverishly in a journal. Photos of that trip are one-dimensional trinkets. But re-reading words scrawled on a train I'm there again, experiencing the alchemy of travel, reliving the trip that transformed and shaped who I'd become. We had a digital camera by the next trip, and travel hasn't been the same since.And now the temptation to use technology is so great that I haven't traveled without a tether to the rest of the world since the Morocco trip, except one perfect week off the grid rafting and camping along the Rogue River in Oregon. I wrote later of a beautiful moment not captured and immediately relayed on Instagram hashtagged #GuessWhatISawInMyBathThisMorning Pure wonder is rare as an adult . Not much in the world of manufactured entertainment takes our breath away. So when I raised my face from a splash in the pristine water of the swimming hole at Mule Creek to find five sets of brown eyes contemplating me, I gasped. One by one, the deer turned and made their surefooted way out of the creek, leaving me dripping and smiling. It's seared in my memory even without broadcasting it to the world -- or rather because I didn't. But what about when I can't get off the grid? Mat Honan writes in Can't Get Away From It All? The Problem Isn't Technology -- It's You for Wired: ""The phone isn't the problem. The problem is us -- our inability to step away from email and games and inessential data, our inability to look up, be it at an alpine lake or at family members. We won't be able to get away from it all for very much longer. So it's vitally important that each of us learns how to live with a persistent connection, everywhere we go, whether it's in the wilderness or at a dinner party."" It's time I learn to let go. We're flying 10,000 miles to start our next trip, a return to Southeast Asia. Airfare for my husband and me cost more than the used car we bought recently. He's on his only vacation of the year. Are we really traveling all that way and spending so much money and time to live out a travel show on Facebook and Instagram? One we know is half fake, anyway? (I wrote about the lie that is the shiny happy Facebook vacation after I spent a miserable rainy week in Florence posting gelato photos only to come home to find everyone thought I had an amazing trip.)The answer has to be no. Even though (sadly) I get a little -- OK, a lot -- freaked out thinking about going dark on all my social media accounts for three weeks, and I'll have to retrain my Pavlovian response which is to post a photo of Every! Single! Thing! I think is interesting, and it will be a lot more work to be present than to just take a picture, to process my reactions internally rather than blurt them out on Facebook, I have to step away from the phone. We have a second chance in Vietnam. I'll take pen and paper -- and maybe a film camera -- and try to rediscover my lost art of travel."
13,WELLNESS,A Brief Medical History Of The Cranberry,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cranberry-medicine_us_5b9daaf8e4b03a1dcc8b1f7d,Cranberries have been shown to protect heart health by reducing atherosclerosis -- or plaque buildup in the arterial walls,2013-11-27,"ITALY - SEPTEMBER 16: Cranberry, Vaccinium oxycoccos, cowberry, V. vitis idaea and bog bilberry, V. uliginosum.

Gottlieb Tobias Wilhelm (1758-1811) was a Bavarian clergyman and naturalist in Augsburg where the first edition was published.' (Photo by Florilegius/SSPL/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9daaf81f00002d0021b4f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Is there a less alluring fruit than this impenetrably tart berry? From its inelegant bog origins to its dowdy association with Pilgrims, there's nothing sexy about cranberries. But that's okay, because the jewel-colored berry is actually a health powerhouse -- even early colonists knew it. We now consume about 400 million pounds of cranberries a year in the form of juice, sauce, dried fruit and other popular dishes. And about 20 percent of cranberry consumption happens during the week of Thanksgiving. But this isn't the first era in which cranberries have been a popular food -- and a celebratory one.When settlers first arrived in the New World, they ate cranberries, cultivated by Native American tribes along the coast of New England in an effort to ward off scurvy, an obsolete condition caused by vitamin C deficiency. Although the cranberries worked by providing a big dose of vitamin C, as NPR reported, medical wisdom at the time concluded that scurvy was caused by an excess of salt in the body and that the sour taste of the berries ""pulled"" salt from the body. Native Americans, meanwhile, actually used a poultice made from cranberries to help heal wounds and tumors, according to the 1999 Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink. That was a smart strategy, as cranberries have a compound that prevents common bacteria like E. coli and Staph from attaching to the walls of tissue cells. This same property is one of the reasons that many women now drink unsweetened cranberry juice or take cranberry extract pills to ward off urinary tract and bladder infections, which are most commonly caused by E. coli. (The research on cranberry's usefulness for UTIs is complicated, but many studies show some benefit.) Indigenous tribes also used cranberry for bladder ailments -- and for kidney disease, according to research presented at New York University. But as our understanding of medicine has gotten more sophisticated, so too has our knowledge of cranberries. These days, many people rely on cranberry's antioxidant power, thanks to a high level of proanthocyanidins -- a class of polyphenols that give the berry its red color and are also associated with helping to prevent just about every chronic disease we can think of. In fact, cranberry has one of the most powerful antioxidant loads of any food, with 1750 ORAC units per 100 grams. “Hundreds of studies show that the bioactive compounds found in cranberries improve health,” lead author Jeffrey Blumberg, Ph.D., director of the Antioxidants Research Laboratory and professor in the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, said in a statement released by the Cranberry Institute. “For example, the polyphenols found in cranberries have been shown to promote a healthy urinary tract and exert protective benefits for cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions.” Cranberries have been shown to protect heart health by reducing atherosclerosis -- or plaque buildup in the arterial walls. Cranberry, researchers at the Mayo Clinic found, may be able to help reduce build-up of arterial plaque thanks to the fruit's ability to reduce the production of a type of arterial wall cell that releases osteocalcin, a compound that is associated with hardening of the arteries. And while most of this research relates to compounds found in cranberries, not your Aunt Ethel's famous bourbon-cranberry sauce, the berry's storied history as both folk and modern medicine should make you feel better about taking a second helping."
14,WELLNESS,Don't Make This Common Thanksgiving Mistake,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-stuffing-turkey-safe_us_5b9dadede4b03a1dcc8b5a6f,"While most people recover from salmonellosis within a few days, complications such as dehydration or an intestinal infection",2013-11-27,"Renee Ferguson, cook and author, stirs up her sausage stuffing as she takes on challenge of a turkey throwdown from Food Network star Bobby Flay, October 12, 2007, at Kendall College in Chicago.

But if the bird is filled with stuffing, the popular side dish could easily come out undercooked, which can result in dangerous bacterial contamination. Rochelle Sirota, RD, CDN, says that stuffing and cooking the turkey could risk the spread of salmonella, a bacterium that is the common cause of foodborne illness. ""It's harder to gauge the heat inside the turkey and you can't really reach all the way inside with a thermometer,"" said Sirota. Each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention receive reports of an average 42,000 cases of salmonellosis -- symptoms of salmonella poisoning that include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps -- but thousands more likely go unreported, according to the CDC website. While most people recover from salmonellosis within a few days, complications such as dehydration or an intestinal infection can be life-threatening, according to the Mayo Clinic. The bacteria is spread through contaminated surfaces, water or food. The primary sources of salmonella are undercooked poultry or eggs, although the bacterium has been linked to vegetables and ground meat. The U.S. Department of Agriculture suggests stuffing be cooked apart from the turkey, especially for cooks who don't use a meat or cooking thermometer. The USDA also advises cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, which will take more time if the bird is stuffed,  according to a study from the University of Georgia.Since you have a lot less control over the stuffing when cooked in a bird, Sirota says the smartest and safest choice is to simply cook it separately and serve it as a side. But that's not the only food contamination risk: If you're cooking ahead, be mindful of how far ahead. Sirota suggests cooking the stuffing no longer than four days in advance, as cooking it any longer ahead of time could also increase the risk of bacteria growth. When cooking ahead for Thanksgiving remember to refrigerate foods within two hours of reaching room temperature. "
