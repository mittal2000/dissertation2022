Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is this year’s keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention, with a high-profile spot in front of a national audience going to one of the party’s top progressive voices.Warren is slated to take the stage Monday night, where the theme will be putting families first and highlighting Hillary Clinton’s lifelong work, according to a Clinton campaign official.The other speakers, beginning in the 9 p.m. hour, will include Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), first lady Michelle Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Warren is just the third woman to deliver the keynote address at a Democratic convention. Rep. Barbara Jordan (D-Texas) first had that honor in 1976, and Ann Richards, when she was Texas state treasurer, had it in 1988. Richards ― who later became governor of her state ― addressed how few women there had been in one of her most famous lines: I am delighted to be here with you this evening, because after listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to know what a real Texas accent sounds like. Twelve years ago Barbara Jordan ― another Texas woman ― Barbara made the keynote address to this convention, and two women in 160 years is about par for the course.Warren stayed neutral during the Democratic primary and endorsed Clinton on June 9. She was a progressive favorite to be Clinton’s running mate. Read more about the history of women at Democratic conventions here, and watch a video on the story behind Richards’ speech:"

In fact, Ekakitie was simply playing Pokémon Go.Ekakitie detailed the ordeal in a Facebook post where he wrote: “Today was the first time that I’ve ever truly feared for my life, and I have the media to thank for that.”Minutes before the Iowa football player’s encounter with the officers, the police received a call about a bank robbery approximately one block away from the park Ekakitie was playing Pokémon Go, Iowa City police sergeant Jorey Bailey told the Des Moines Register. The responding Iowa City police officers were given a description of the suspect that matched Ekakitie, “a large black male, wearing all black, with something on the top of his head (and the suspect is armed).”Ekakitie, who was wearing all black with black goggles on his head, was approached by the responding officers who allegedly asked him to turn around. Ekakitie wrote that he was listening to music and couldn’t hear the officers request which led to the officers drawing their weapons. He wrote that he’s thankful to be alive and that he very well could have become “another statistic.” “Misunderstandings happen all the time and just like that things can go south very quickly,” Ekakitie wrote. Despite the case of mistaken identity, Ekakitie thanked the Iowa City police department for “handling a sensitive situation very professionally.” He added that he wanted to urge others, “to attempt to unlearn some of the prejudices that we have learned about each other and now plague our minds and our society. I am convinced that in the same way that we learned these prejudices, we can also unlearn them.”"
3,BLACK VOICES,Ben Vereen On His Decision To Promote Arts Education At The DNC,Brennan Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-vereen-democratic-national-convention_us_57927f92e4b02d5d5ed19cb2,"“We need our creative thinking people in politics, in corporations to think on the up, rather than the down.”",2016-07-25,"“In order to do what we do in society, [it’s] gotta come from the creative aspect of art,” Vereen told HuffPost.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579281b32a00002e004f611a.jpeg?ops=crop_0_18_869_786%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"“Life, itself, is an art form,” according to actor Ben Vereen.This belief is why the legendary entertainer wants to help preserve the country’s artistic legacy by promoting creative thinking in business and politics.During the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 26 Vereen plans to advocate for arts education in schools by speaking on behalf of the nation’s leading nonprofit organization for advancing arts education, Americans for the Arts.Vereen told The Huffington Post in an interview that the next generation of world leaders can benefit greatly from the intersection of the arts and politics. “In order to do what we do in society, [it’s] gotta come from the creative aspect of art,” Vereen told HuffPost. “The politicians need it in order to move society or civilization into a forum which is supposed to be better for the people. Everyone has their own agenda, but an agenda comes from a breath of creativity. My want is that they [politicians] will consider putting [the] arts back into school[s] full force for our children who can make a better difference in our world if we give them the tools that they need.”The Tony Award winner went on to say that this “creative aspect” for children can be achieved by having access to key tools, such as: art supplies and music instruments, which can provide them with the chance to explore career opportunities.“I’m not saying everybody’s got to be a song and dance man or an artist, or whatever aspect that we separate ourselves from,” he said. “We need our creative thinking people in politics, in corporations to think on the up, rather than the down.”A 2002 report by the Arts Education Partnership found that students who were exposed to drama, music and dance may have a better chance at mastering reading, writing and math. But there have been other reports which have suggested that arts programs tend to be the first thing cut from school’s facing budget issues.As a solution, Vereen said he wants to urge Americans to empower themselves by working in conjunction with the government in order to see an effective change in schools nationwide. “We turn to the government, a lot, and expect them to do things, but we must do the things that need to be done,” he said. “We are the thinkers that make things happen. My want is that they [politicians] go back into the communities and say, ‘we must become a force for the arts.’ We need government funding in order to keep the arts alive, yes. But the funding comes from us. So we need to reallocate where that funding goes.”For more info on American’s for the Arts click here."

The climate change activist was one of few high-profile Democrats who had not backed the former secretary of state ― and his silence was particularly notable given that Gore was vice president to Clinton’s husband, President Bill Clinton. Gore, who made an unsuccessful bid for president in 2000, is skipping the Democratic National Convention this week. But he voiced his support for Clinton in a series of tweets. Gore held out on endorsing for months. He told People Magazine last November that it was “still too early,” and an unnamed spokesman told Politico the same month that he had “no plans to endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary.” He declined once again to endorse in May, but told NBC’s “Today” that he would back the eventual Democratic nominee. A number of party leaders waited until early June, when Clinton secured enough delegates to clinch the nomination, to endorse her over challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). President Barack Obama endorsed Clinton in June, as did Vice President Joe Biden and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Clinton is set to officially accept her party’s nomination at the convention later this week, and Sanders endorsed her earlier this month. Gore stayed out of the Democratic primary during Clinton’s last bid in 2008. He endorsed Obama for president after she dropped out of the race that year. Gore endorsed Democratic candidate Howard Dean in the 2004 primary. Gore skipped the Democratic National Convention in 2012 as well.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Al Gore ran for president in 2001. It was 2000."

In July, two black men, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, were shot and killed by police ― both their deaths filmed and released to the public, sparking public anger and protests. Also this month, police officers were ambushed and killed on multiple occasions ― once in Dallas, Texas, where five officers were killed, and once in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where three were. “As a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers,” Jordan writes. “I grieve with the families who have lost loved ones, as I know their pain all too well.”Jordan has long been criticized for his unwillingness to use his voice for the greater good. In 2015, fellow NBA great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar stated plainly that Jordan has chosen “commerce over conscience.” But on Monday, Jordan made clear he was ready to use both his words and his wallet to help. In the letter, Jordan said he had also decided to donate $1 million to the International Association of Chiefs of Police’s Institute for Community-Police Relations, and $1 million to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.“The problems we face didn’t happen overnight and they won’t be solved tomorrow, but if we all work together, we can foster greater understanding, positive change and create a more peaceful world for ourselves, our children, our families and our communities.”Head to The Undefeated to read the letter in its entirety."

In an interview with A Plus (which Kutcher co-founded), Kunis revealed she felt “so much guilt” for returning to work after having Wyatt. “I felt like I was failing as a mother because I wasn’t there for her every minute of the day,” she said. “It took me a little while to realize that I was a better mom going back to work because when I was with her, I was present 100 percent. If you are with your kid and you are present, and you are there and you’re engaged, and you care, then you’re a great mom.” Kunis also stressed that the “perfect mom” doesn’t exist. If mothers are giving it their all, no one should expect anything more.“It’s so taboo to be like, ‘I feel like I’m not perfect,’” she said. “You just have to know you’re doing the best you can, and that’s more than enough. I know I’m the best mom Wyatt’s ever had, and I’m the best mom for her.”The “That ‘70s Shows” star had a similar message in her interview with ET Canada when she gave herself well-deserved credit for her motherhood journey.“I’m the only mom my daughter is hopefully ever going to know and I’m the best version there is for her,” she said. “I’ve only been a mom for 21 months.”And in those 21 months, Kunis, who is expecting another child with Kutcher, has learned what it means to truly love someone. In her interview with A Plus, she explained that she and her husband now know what it’s like to love without limits.“I thought that I could not have greater love than the love for my husband,” Kunis said. “This is not to be cheesy, but I literally was like this must be the greatest love a human being can have and we both felt that about each other. Then, we had Wyatt and we were like, ‘Whoa!’”Read Kunis’ interview in full at A Plus. "

These comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process. The DNC does not ― and will not ― tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates. Individual staffers have also rightfully apologized for their comments, and the DNC is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens again.This article has been updated with a statement from the FBI and Brazile’s official apology."

The program is part of the city’s Young Men’s Initiative, a private-public partnership that aims to reduce disparities in health, education and employment for local men of color. He ― who is majoring in education ― plans to work in a high-needs school after graduation as a member of NYC Men Teach, where he is looking forward to educating kids of color.Forty-three percent of New York City students are boys of color, and research shows that students perform better when they are taught by teachers of the same race. Right now though, less than 10 percent of the city’s teachers are black, Hispanic or Asian men. This hardly reflects the diversity of the city’s students. Teachers of color serve as examples for their students, and reduce the likelihood that their students will be subjected to harmful implicit biases. Kevin He knows first hand about the importance of these relationships. When he recalls the teachers who had an impact on his life, he can name a handful. There is the history teacher who took He under his wing, taught him about poetry, and allowed He to be his apprentice when tutoring struggling students. There is the advisor who inspired He with tales of his childhood in Honduras. The physical education teacher who helped He with his tie “was always there to talk.”Collectively, these male educators taught He about “what it is to be a man in society.”“The message I took away from [my teachers was]: you got to try and be yourself and not be set up by society in your gender role. That ultra masculine role of, ‘oh men don’t cry, they bleed’ and things like that and ‘they don’t show feeling’ ... don’t do that, try to be yourself. That was really inspiring to me,” said He. For 2016, program leaders hope to add 300 more men of color to the teacher pipeline than what is typical in a given year. To do this, representatives have plastered subways with advertisements, sent recruiters to city’s around the country, and partnered with Teach for America. NYC Men Teach is working with the organization and other programs like New York City Teaching Fellows and City University of New York on teacher training. The goal is to provide prospective teachers with a variety of training options, so that they are not limited by specific circumstances. The shortage of male teachers of color extends beyond New York City, existing on a national level. As the nation’s classrooms become increasingly diverse ― a majority of students now come from minority groups ― the issue has become ever more pressing. However, the shortage is a result of more than just a recruitment problem. Turnover rates are high for teachers of color, who tend to work in some of the hardest to staff schools.“Minority teachers are being hired at a higher proportional rate than other teachers,” according to a 2015 report from the Shanker Institute. However, these teachers are more likely to work in “hard-to-staff, high-poverty urban schools ... [that are] more likely to have less-desirable working conditions. And these less-desirable conditions, our data suggest, account for the higher rates of minority teacher turnover.”That’s why NYC Men Teach also has a strong mentorship component, designed to build a support system around novice educators. New participants will be assigned a more experienced educator to help guide them through their new schools. The initiative will also offer community programs throughout the year and participants will be incentivized to get involved. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the NYC Men Teach initiative in January 2015, and has put $16 million behind the program. This type of investment and commitment is relatively rare for such an initiative, said Travis Bristol, a professor at Boston University’s school of education.Over the past year, first lady of New York City Chirlane McCray and the deputy mayor for strategic policy initiatives Richard Buery have championed the cause.“I don’t need numbers to understand why NYC Men Teach is so important. I felt it and I experienced this need in my own life from my kindergarten years to my senior year in college,” said McCray at a June kickoff event for the initiative. “I had only a few teachers of color. I can actually count them on less than one hand. It was important to me that our own children have teachers of color.”Indeed, Gabriel Gonzalez, a rising senior at Hunter College, isn’t sure where he would be had it not been for his third-grade teacher, who was male. Gonzalez grew up with a single mother who worked two jobs, and his teacher helped fill in some of the gaps Gonzalez encountered at home where there was no father figure. Gonzalez, who signed up for NYC Men Teach, still keeps in touch with that particular educator, who he says kept him from “falling into that crack of not being a part of education.”“I was lost but I met a male educator who took it upon himself to [make sure] I wasn’t going to be lost,” Gonzalez said. “That’s exactly who I intend to educate, kids like me when I was a younger child.” ______Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton will begin receiving the briefings after the Democratic National Convention ends on Thursday, ABC News reported Monday. As the Republican nominee for president, Trump is now among a handful of people who do not hold a security clearance but have the potential to get these briefings. But he also has closer ties to a foreign government than perhaps any presidential candidate in recent history.Trump has called for following Moscow’s lead on various global issues and questioned whether it’s necessary for the U.S. to always defend other members of NATO, the alliance created during the Cold War to protect American partners from an expansionist Soviet Union. His rhetoric about foreign policy neatly matches the message coming out of Moscow: that America has little need for its long-time partners in Europe ― particularly in NATO ― or elsewhere, and that the U.S. should have less influence internationally. Trump has extensive business and financial ties to Russia. The Washington Post has described his relationship with Putin as a “bromance.” Troll accounts tied to the Russian government have promoted Trump on Twitter, the New Yorker’s Adrian Chen noted last year. And this week, mysterious hackers released internal Democratic National Committee emails ― a move that security experts and reporters are increasingly convinced was an attempt by the Russian government to swing the presidential election to Trump.Trump’s deep relationship with Russia has the intelligence community worried.“Never have we had a candidate so tied to a foreign power, especially one that is so hostile to the U.S. in many ways, and one that is actively messing with our election,” said one former senior intelligence official. “Many [in the intelligence community] don’t care about U.S. politics and pride themselves on being nonpartisan, but the ties to Russia are deeply disturbing.”[Read More: The Real Winner Of The GOP Convention Was Vladimir Putin]Former intelligence officials say that Trump would not be briefed on covert actions or learn about sensitive sources or methods of collecting intelligence, but he could have access to information that would be highly valuable to Putin.That could include briefings on U.S. strategy in Syria or Ukraine; the CIA’s assessment of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad or the Russian leadership; or U.S. spy agencies’ knowledge of Russian military movements.“The notion that the Trump team could request intel briefings on Russia when they clearly have close ties is horrifying, especially after the DNC leak,” said the former intelligence official. Intelligence community briefers will have to be careful when giving information to the presidential nominees, John McLaughlin, a former deputy director for intelligence at the Central Intelligence Agency, told HuffPost. “I don’t know what specific guidance the briefers have been given by intelligence community leadership, but I would recommend focusing on broad trends and staying away from specific sources and methods of acquiring information.” Russia attempting to intervene in American electoral politics would be concerning, said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House intelligence committee, which has oversight over the CIA and other intel agencies. “Given Donald Trump’s well known admiration for Putin and his belittling of NATO, the Russians have both the means and the motive to engage in a hack of the DNC and the dump of its emails prior to the Democratic convention,” Schiff said. “That foreign actors may be trying to influence our election ― let alone a powerful adversary like Russia ― should concern all Americans of any party.”Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, shied away from saying whether Clinton believes the Russians were behind the hack in a press conference Monday morning. But he didn’t drop the issue. “Voters need to take a look at this,” he said. “It’s troubling if it’s true.”Even DNC associates’ personal email accounts may have been targeted by hackers, Yahoo News’ Michael Isikoff reported Monday. According to Isikoff, a Yahoo security team known as “The Paranoids” warned Alexandra Chalupa, a DNC consultant who had been researching Trump aide Paul Manafort’s ties to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, that it “strongly” suspected that her account had “been the target of state-sponsored actors.” The DNC told Chalupa to stop the work, but continued to investigate the hack. “The last time somebody broke into the DNC,” a Democratic Party security source told Isikoff, “it led to the resignation of a president.” Regardless of the concerns of some in the intelligence community, Trump is nearly certain to get the briefings starting later this week. “I do not intend to withhold briefings from any officially nominated, eligible candidate,” James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, wrote to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in a letter dated July 11.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Sign up here to get an email from reporter Ryan Grim when he writes a new story."

Since Mozambique's 15-year civil war ended in 1992, the country has made a strong recovery. However, it suffered setbacks with severe floods in 2000 and 2001, followed by two years of drought in 2002 and 2003. These emergencies had a huge impact and led to widespread food shortages, an increase in outbreaks of infectious diseases, including cholera, measles and meningitis. Families in rural areas in particular suffer from poverty and a lack of basic services. About 13 per cent of babies die before their first birthday, 20 per cent of children die before the age of five, and 48 per cent of the country's children are chronically malnourished. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is having a devastating effect on families, with tens of thousands of children orphaned, many of them also HIV-positive or already ill with AIDS.

To see someone reaching that age of 35, 36 now, it’s not a joke,” he said.Most of the funerals that he goes to are for people who are even younger, as a deadly virus that no one wants to speak about keeps picking off Mozambique’s youth.“We are surrounded by people who have HIV, to be frank,” said Zita, who until recently also knew very little about the province’s biggest killer.But with around one in four in Gaza infected with HIV, according to the government, Zita is now taking advantage of a free and anonymous text message service to educate himself about sexual health, something that is off the regular curriculum.Since April, the UNICEF-funded ‘SMS-Biz’ myth-busting project aimed at 10 to 24-year-olds has been rolled out in 40 of Gaza’s schools.Pupils at Shimundo secondary school, where Zita teaches, can send the most intimate questions that they can’t get answers to in the dirt-track villages surrounding Xai-Xai, a provincial capital whose grand avenues speak of a former glory.Four hours south in the capital Maputo, a dozen counsellors sit at their screens and copy and paste answers to commonly asked and often confused questions about HIV and malaria, sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy and sex.They hope to reach young people like 16-year-old Frederica, who doesn’t want to give her real name. She is sexually active and one of many pupils still spouting the myth that you contract HIV by using an infected person’s eating utensils and kissing with tongues.She heard this first from her primary school teacher. She keeps hearing it from her mother, who is HIV-positive and still snatches the odd cup from her hands.Her mother keeps her status a secret, and Frederica has never been tested for HIV, despite her mother testing positive when pregnant with her.“I don’t think I have it, because I’ve never done anything to get it, like eating from the same dish as someone who does,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.MYTHSNationwide, around one in eight people have HIV or AIDS according to government data that is questioned by non-governmental groups working in the health sector.Gaza’s officials, including the province’s governor, can’t provide figures for how much is being spent on fighting HIV.Without blinking, the youth ministry’s director says that he thinks the average life expectancy is around 40.Mozambique has the world’s eighth highest HIV prevalence. The state contributes around five percent to spending on programmes, according to 2014 data - basically paying health worker salaries and allowing donors like the United States to pick up the rest.In Maputo, the team of counsellors is doing its best to chip away at the myths and misconceptions that allow the virus to thrive.They can often answer over 100 messages a day, depending on their complexity and the level of myth-busting required.“People believe that if you’re circumcised you can’t get HIV,” says 17-year-old counsellor Alfabeto Chiloveque.He routinely corrects the callers by saying that it helps to reduce the risk, but they have to use condoms, only to come up against resistance to using what many boys and men perceive as a threat to their manhood.“They say that the condom is not good for the health of people, like they got HIV with the condoms ... they sell us a condom that gives us HIV when you use it,” said Chiloveque.Others say: “When you have spots on your face, you have to have sex to get rid of them,” he added.Counsellor Flavia Meringue still gets asked if AIDS really exists, and whether you can get it from kissing or shaking hands.She used to go to schools to speak to students who wouldn’t dare ask any questions. Trying to go house to house with her message would often result in empty streets and closed doors.“When parents used to see people coming in t-shirts, they used to think that we were coming to tell their children to have sex so they would hide them, so this system is better,” although the numbers using the service are still small, she said.EARLY MARRIAGEMother-to-child transmission of HIV has dropped in Mozambique due to programmes testing pregnant women and giving positive women anti-retroviral treatment (ARTs) to protect children during pregnancy and breastfeeding.Men are harder to reach in places like Gaza, where the risk of HIV is fuelled by widespread polygamy and migration back and forth to neighbouring South Africa for work.The tradition of early marriage also puts girls at risk of infection.Despite high HIV rates and the fact that around half of Mozambican girls are married before 18, adults “don’t think that this is an important to discuss,” said Margarida Jeiambe, who heads the Coalizao youth organisation running the counselling.“They want to make sure that they can control all the adolescent period but..they don’t understand the importance of having a private space” for them to discuss sexuality, she said.Children have told the counsellors via text message that youth counselling centres they are referred to in schools and clinics are being used as storerooms or were never established.While SMS-Biz is helping children who are proactive, curious and fluent in Portuguese - Mozambique’s official language that sits among many local languages - its reach is limited.But for 14-year-old Wildiano Maxaieie, who looks more like 10 but is wiser than his years, SMS-Biz has been a revelation.“When I have a question, I get told the answer by people who are informed. Not everyone knows everything,” he said.“I don’t want to get HIV. I have too much I want to do,” he said, swinging his oversized green plimsolls below his seat.

But he conceded an earlier proposal for the communique referred to the court’s decision.In a separate statement, China and ASEAN reaffirmed a commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea and said they would refrain from activities that would complicate or escalate disputes.

But he conceded an earlier proposal for the communique referred to the court’s decision.In a separate statement, China and ASEAN reaffirmed a commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea and said they would refrain from activities that would complicate or escalate disputes. That included inhabiting any presently uninhabited islands or reefs, it added.China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said a page had been turned after the “deeply flawed” ruling and it was time to lower the temperature in the dispute.“It seems like certain countries from outside the region have got all worked up, keeping the fever high,” Wang told reporters.China frequently blames the United States for raising tensions in the region and has warned regional rival Japan to steer clear of the dispute.MAJOR POWERS ARRIVEThe United States, allied with the Philippines and cultivating closer relations with Vietnam, has called on China to respect the court’s ruling.It has criticized China’s building of artificial islands and facilities in the sea and has sailed warships close to the disputed territory to assert freedom of navigation rights.Meeting U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice in Beijing, Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi said both countries needed to make concerted efforts to ensure stable and good relations between the two major powers.“So far this year, relations between China and the United States have generally been stable, maintaining coordination and cooperation on bilateral, regional and international level.

Our staff reporters will provide education coverage from Cleveland and Philadelphia. In an event that could be called a love fest, Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Hillary Clinton laid out her education priorities in a rollicking speech at the annual assembly of the National Education Association (NEA), the nation’s largest teachers union. Clinton profusely thanked teachers for doing the difficult job of educating the nation’s children, and the 7,500 educators in attendance responded with cascading chants of “Hillary, Hillary.”There was, however, one moment of discord.“When schools get it right, whether they are traditional public schools or public charter schools, let’s figure out what’s working,” said Clinton to loud boos over the mention of charter schools, which are publicly-funded, independently run public schools that often employ non-unionized teachers.Clinton paused and continued: “We don’t have time for these education wars.”In most policy areas the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign want to be seen as the inheritor of the popular sitting president’s legacy, but perhaps no area has divided the party more than K-12 education. While the Clinton campaign has focused on issues that unite the party ― such as expanding access to pre-kindergarten programs, raising teacher pay and increasing school funding ― a recent fight over the party’s platform, a document that lays out the party’s policy goals, underscores how difficult ending the party’s internal education wars could be.Related: Poll: Voters agree, candidates should talk preschoolAt a July meeting in Orlando, Florida to write the party’s platform, delegates appointed by Clinton’s main rival in the primaries, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, pushed through a slew of amendments to the original draft, which together represent a sharp turn away from the policies of the Obama administration which used federal funding to push states to raise academic standards and to tie test scores to teacher evaluations. The new language supports the rights of parents to opt their children out of standardized tests, demand more oversight of charters and oppose evaluating teachers using their students’ standardized test scores.“We moved the debate and raised some issues that the party had ignored,” said Chuck Pascal, a Sanders delegate, former school board member and former mayor from Leechburg, Pennsylvania. “We introduced amendments that made the platform more reflective of the positions of rank-and-file Democrats in the field, educators and activists.”“We needed to make clear that the party is not in lockstep behind what had become orthodoxy for a while, more charters and more testing and all of these things that have weakened public education,” added Pascal. But the reformers who shifted the party away from its traditional stances, groups like Democrats for Education Reform, individual educators like Louisiana superintendent John White and President Obama himself, are still a potentially powerful force in the party, even if the platform, a non-binding proposal, includes rebuttals of their ideas.Related: What do we invest in the country’s youngest? Little to nothingFor the last 15 years, many teachers have felt like they’ve consistently been losing the education policy wars even with a Democrat in the White House. The Obama administration embraced much of the testing and accountability policies of the George W. Bush-No Child Left Behind era. Teachers complained that they were being punished for factors beyond their control like poverty and that the federal government’s support for charter schools undermined their unions and their job security. Many were further alienated by the expanding practice of tying teacher evaluations to student test scores and the adoption of the new rigorous standards known as Common Core, all policies propelled by the Obama administration. Clinton, who has historically been a supporter of both teachers unions and charter schools and testing, is trying to walk the line between the two factions. Teachers unions, who backed her early on in her drawn-out primary fight against Sanders, want a near complete reversal in tone and policies from the Obama administration.However, education reformers, who are supportive of Obama’s policies, will still have sway with Clinton, though, and often note the civil rights roots of school accountability. The platform changes to the Democratic platform left many of them livid.“What they did in Orlando is clearly at odds with the balanced position Clinton has staked out over the course of the campaign,” said Charles Barone, the director of policy at Democrats for Education Reform. “She was trying to find common ground and they threw a temper tantrum, saying we want everything our way.”Pascal says the amendments against testing passed without opposition, though the delegates negotiated the language around charter schools.Related: Sanders’ free college plan would take from the rich to give to the richAlready, the passage of a new federal education law last year may have made it easier for Clinton to move beyond the central fights within the party.The Obama administration worked with the Republican-controlled Congress to update the widely loathed No Child Left Behind Act, replacing it with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). A bipartisan coalition of Republicans and Democrats denounced the law’s emphasis on testing in particular. ESSA will continue to require students to test students annually in grades three through eight and once in high school. However, decisions about how those scores will be used are now largely left to the states, moving the battles over accountability to state capitols.Members of the Obama administration have said they are working feverishly to complete the regulations that will spell out the details of how states must comply with the new law, before a new administration comes in.With ESSA moving many of the most divisive battles of the education wars to the states, Laura Bornfreund, director of early and elementary education at New America, thinks that an education department in Hillary Clinton’s administration would push forward policies that most liberals agree on, namely, expanding access to pre-kindergarten as well as science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) classes for low-income students and reducing suspension and expulsion rates.Peter Cunningham, the executive director of Education Post, a nonprofit communications firm focused on improving public education, and a former assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Education during the Obama administration, thinks that Clinton can ultimately unite the party by focusing on what both factions agree on.“We all support higher funding, expanding early learning options, better pay for teachers,” said Cunningham. “I think she should be arguing that there are a lot of people on the other side who just want to defund education. The grand bargain with Republicans has always been accountability for more resources.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education."

But he backs him nonetheless.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) offered his support for the choice of Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) as the Democratic vice presidential nominee, though he did so by calling it a vast improvement over the Republican alternative more than offering a testament to Kaine’s liberal bona fides. Speaking to CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sanders acknowledged that he and Kaine were not always ideologically in symmetry. That is a statement of fact: few are 100 percent in line with Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist. And Kaine has, on several issues, hewed closer to the center of the ideological spectrum.Still, Sanders said that “on his worst, worst, worst day, Tim Kaine is 100 times better than Donald Trump will ever be.”“Tim is an extremely bright guy, a very nice guy,” said Sanders. “Are his political views different than mine? Yes, they are. He is more conservative than I am. But compared to Donald Trump, a guy who rejects science, doesn’t even believe that climate change is real, let alone that we have to take bold action to transform our energy system, a Donald Trump who wants to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top two-tenths of 1 percent, a Donald Trump who goes around the country insulting Mexicans and Latinos and Muslims and women, veterans and African-Americans…” The quasi-endorsement should be welcome news for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, which is hoping to keep the progressive base of the Democratic Party in line as it heads into this week’s convention. Sanders supporters had hoped that she’d choose more of a liberal stalwart as her running mate. And in the hours after the Kaine pick was announced, the lack of a response from Sanders grew conspicuous. Sanders still has obvious grievances over how he was treated by the Democratic National Committee during the primary process. But the selection of Kaine doesn’t appear to be that strong an aggravation."

The cause of the blaze, which broke out shortly after 2 p.m. on Friday, is under investigation.Strong winds and temperatures reaching 97 degrees Fahrenheit are expected to hamper the efforts of the more than 1,600 firefighters battling the blaze, a sheriff’s department spokesman said.The blaze was 10 percent contained, he said.The fire has prompted the South Coast Air Quality Management District to issue a smoke warning effective until midnight on Monday.Officials said one firefighter sustained a minor injury, and that structures had been destroyed or damaged in the Bear Divide and Sand Canyon areas.(Reporting by Laila Kearney; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)"
27,POLITICS,Trump Threatens To Pull The U.S. Out Of The World Trade Organization,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-wto_us_5794c63de4b01180b52f4bed,Add it to the list.,2016-07-24,Donald Trump doesn't like international institutions.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Sunday that he would consider pulling the United States out of the World Trade Organization should he end up winning the election. The comments, made to NBC’s “Meet the Press,” are the latest in a series of Trump threats to pull the U.S. away from international institutions and compacts. Trump’s disgust for trade deals is well-known. And in the midst of his convention in Cleveland, he reiterated to The New York Times that he would not come to the aid of NATO allies if they hadn’t fully paid their dues to the organization.Trump’s distaste for the WTO appears to be based on his view that it’s helped create a trade imbalance for the United States ― though he doesn’t explicitly say that; he merely calls the organization “a disaster.” Trump said that he would like to levy a tax of somewhere between 15 and 35 percent on the products of U.S. companies that move their production jobs overseas. When “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd told him that some of those hikes “aren’t going to get through” the WTO, the Republican nominee responded in kind. “Then we’re going to renegotiate or we’re going to pull out,” he said. “These trade deals are a disaster, Chuck. You know, the World Trade Organization is a disaster.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

After that, the convention was never the same.“Hi, I’m Skye,” she said, innocently enough.“Hi, Skye, what’s your question?” replied moderator Chris Hardwick, unsuspecting of the tidal wave about to crash.Then this happened:""Skye gettin’ real,” said Hardwick. The auditorium was erupting in laughter, but Matini, undaunted, continued her full question:“My question is if you guys were going to die a horrible death ... on the show ... what would you like it to be?” Check it out here (44:40 mark):The cast went on to give their answers, but Skye had already dropped the mic.The Huffington Post caught up with Skye and her mama after the panel. Skye’s mother confirmed her daughter actually does watch a little “Fear the Walking Dead.” She seemed just as impressed with Skye as the thousands of people in Hall H.We haven’t seen a scene stealer like this since Lyanna Mormont in “Game of Thrones.” In fact, it’s a good thing for Jon Snow that Skye isn’t in the HBO show.

I didn’t want to go to Earth because I thought Earth was boring.”She hinted to the crowd that actor Michael Biehn, who played Cpl. Dwayne Hicks, might also be involved in this sequel, but didn’t offer details of how that might work since his character died in the opening scene of 1992’s “Alien 3.”The prospective film would mark Weaver’s fifth in the “Alien” franchise and the first since 1997’s “Alien: Resurrection.”“It’s a great story and it’s satisfying to me to give this woman an ending,” Weaver said, according to Entertainment Weekly. Nothing is set in stone, and Weaver said the parties involved have other projects on the docket to complete.“I am hoping when we finish those jobs we will circle back and start to do it,” she said at Comic-Con.Another issue, according to EW, is the need to wait for Ridley Scott to finish “Alien: Covenant,” a prequel to the original 1979 “Alien” film that is also a sequel to his 2012 film “Prometheus.” "

32,POLITICS,Democrats Agree To Compromise On Superdelegates And Other Reforms,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-superdelegates-compromise_us_5794ec78e4b01180b52f5163,A “unity commission” proposal will strip two-thirds of superdelegates of their power to vote independently.,2016-07-24,A compromise reached between supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Hillary Clinton would reduce the power of superdelegates.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5794edcc1200002a00a53218.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Democratic National Convention’s Rules Committee agreed on Saturday evening to create a “unity commission” that will recommend reductions in the power of superdelegates and enable wider participation in party caucuses.Although the commission’s recommendations would not be binding, activists who sought to eliminate superdelegates altogether are celebrating it as a significant victory given their lack of control of the Rules Committee and other key party organs.The accord, reached after a marathon committee meeting and several rounds of voting, represents an attempt by the party to bridge the divide between supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. National progressive groups and an array of Sanders delegates, along with some Clinton supporters, were pushing for the removal of all superdelegates, who are elected officials and other party insiders.Committee members voted by a wide margin to approve the creation of a 21-member commission charged specifically with recommending that superdelegates who are not governors, senators or members of the House would become pledged delegates, losing their power to vote independently of their state’s voters. By becoming pledged delegates, they would be required to represent the proportional results of the primary or caucus in their state. In effect, some two-thirds of the current total of superdelegates would lose their influence if the commission’s recommendations are adopted.The Sanders and Clinton campaigns had been in talks on a compromise for several days, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.Sanders has long argued that superdelegates are a way for the Democratic Party to limit the influence of insurgent candidates. The Vermont progressive often noted that hundreds of superdelegates endorsed Clinton before he even announced his campaign. In that way, even in states where superdelegates did not change the math in Clinton’s favor, they contributed to a perception that Clinton’s nomination was inevitable, according to Sanders. The unity commission’s mandate also includes some other nods to the respective concerns of Clinton and Sanders supporters. The commission would increase the number of eligible voters in caucuses, contests where Sanders did well. Clinton backers have argued that the small, hours-long meeting-style contests favor party activists. The commission would also “encourage” the participation of previously unaffiliated voters by allowing for party registration on election day. Sanders has complained that strict registration rules kept out the independent and unaffiliated voters he was attracting to the polls.The commission, to be convened within 60 days of the general election, would present its proposals to the Democratic National Committee for approval by Jan. 1, 2018. The DNC would then decide on whether to adopt the suggestions well ahead of the next presidential primaries in 2020.The Sanders delegates and progressive groups pushing for superdelegates’ complete elimination hailed the compromise as a step in the right direction. Opponents of superdelegates could not amend the party rules exactly as they wanted as they did not have enough votes on the Rules Committee. But since the amendment to eliminate superdelegates received over 25 percent support on the committee, its backers would be able to bring the proposal to a vote among all the delegates on the convention floor. The dissenting delegates on the committee initially promised to do just that. But after the compromise to create the commission was reached, support for a floor vote evaporated. Progressive activists acknowledged, however, that to even ensure the adoption of the new commission’s recommendations they would need to keep up the pressure on party officials. There is, after all, no requirement for the Democratic National Committee to accept the proposals.David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, the group behind EndSuperDelegates.com, appeared to acknowledge as much in his statement on the compromise agreement.“This is a partial victory — and we got this far only because of massive grassroots outcry about the superdelegates system,” Segal said in a statement on Saturday evening. “Demand Progress will keep up the pressure to make sure the recommendations are adopted by the DNC — and to fight for fair representation and against the influence of money in all realms of American politics.” "

Any unauthorized entry of an aircraft required the scrambling of Bulgarian fighter jets, he added.Russian passenger planes breached the airspace six times in the past month, he said.Bulgaria had demanded an explanation from Moscow over the violations, Nenchev said, describing the incidents as “provocations toward Bulgaria and its air forces”.The Russian Defence Ministry was not immediately able to comment when contacted by Reuters.In January, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged Russia to “take all necessary measures” to ensure NATO airspace was not violated.His comments came after Turkey shot down in November a Russian warplane flying a sortie over Syria that it said had violated its airspace, triggering a diplomatic rupture in which Russia imposed economic sanctions.Last September, Bulgaria denied Russian aid flights bound for Syria entry to its airspace, citing it had serious doubts about the cargo onboard.Bulgaria, a former Communist state and once staunch ally of Moscow, is almost entirely dependent on Russian energy supplies, and many Bulgarians feel a deep affinity for their giant neighbor across the Black Sea.(Reporting by Angel Krasimirov; Additional reporting by Alex Winning in Moscow; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)"

He had been in trouble with police repeatedly for drug-taking and other offenses and faced deportation to Bulgaria.The incident, after three other attacks since July 18 that left 10 people dead and dozens injured, will fuel growing public unease about Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-door refugee policy. More than a million migrants entered Germany over the past year, many fleeing war in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq.Federal Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said no decision would be made on changing asylum or immigration rules until investigations into the recent incidents are finished.“Of course I would and will initiate appropriate amendments if they are necessary or if I think they are necessary, but only then,” he said.Germany’s federal and state security authorities have more than 400 leads on fighters or members of Islamist organizations among refugees in the country, the BKA federal police said.THREE OTHER CASESThe suicide bomber had been denied entry to the Ansbach Open music festival shortly before detonating the bomb outside a restaurant, Herrmann said. More than 2,000 people were evacuated from the festival after the explosion, police said.Herrmann told Reuters the recent attacks raised serious questions about Germany’s asylum law and security nationwide. He planned to introduce measures at a meeting of Bavaria’s conservative government on Tuesday to strengthen police forces, in part by ensuring they have adequate equipment.It was the second violent incident in Germany on Sunday and the fourth in the past week, including the killing of nine people by a deranged 18-year-old Iranian-German gunman in the Bavarian capital Munich on Friday.Earlier on Sunday, a 21-year-old Syrian refugee was arrested after killing a pregnant woman and wounding two people with a machete in the southwestern city of Reutlingen, near Stuttgart.A week ago a 17-year-old youth who had sought asylum in Germany was shot dead by police after wounding five people with an axe near Wuerzburg, also in Bavaria. He was initially thought to be Afghan but federal Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere has since said he may have been from Pakistan.Police said neither Sunday’s machete attack nor Friday’s shooting in Munich bore any sign of connections with Islamic State or other militant groups.Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Wuerzburg attack as well as the July 14 rampage in the French Riviera city of Nice in which a Tunisian man drove a truck into Bastille Day crowds, killing 84 people."

The move angered the U.S. government and he then went underground.He told Mexican magazine Proceso in an interview published on Saturday that he was not behind the murder of Drug Enforcement Administration agent Camarena, but admitted that he was present.“I didn’t organize, kidnap or kill Mr Camarena... I was in the wrong place,” he said, speaking in an undisclosed location.The DEA said at the time of his release that it would push for him to be tried in a U.S. court. The United States is currently offering a reward of up to $5 million dollar for information leading to Caro Quintero’s recapture.Separately, the U.S. Treasury said in May that Caro Quintero was continuing to traffic illegal drugs since being released from a Mexican prison and it named his common-law wife as a key accomplice.But Caro Quintero, a former leader of the Guadalajara Cartel, said he is no longer involved in the drug trade and just wants to be left in peace. He said he was short of money. “I’m not a danger to Mexican society or the government or the United States,” he said.(Reporting by Anahi Rama; Writing by Christine Murray; Editing by Alistair Bell)"

He described Gulen’s network as “like a cancer” and said he would treat them like a “separatist terrorist organization” and root them out, wherever they may be.Gulen, 75, denies plotting against the state and suggested the day after the abortive coup that it may have been staged to justify a crackdown on his followers.The millions of members of Gulen’s “Hizmet” (Service) movement do not outwardly identify as supporters. Since the failed coup many are going even further underground, refusing to take calls or trying to leave the country.Some followers are dumping books in the woods and publishers are getting rid of their stocks, said Nedim Sener, an investigative journalist at Posta newspaper who wrote a book on the Gulen movement’s efforts to infiltrate the state and was jailed in 2011 for more than a year.A senior journalist at a Gulen-affiliated newspaper, speaking on condition of anonymity because he feared reprisals, said he and other editors were afraid to go to the paper’s office in the days following the failed coup and that their printers refused to continue publishing.“I advised my colleagues not to go to the office for their own safety,” he said. “The newspaper has become a liability, it has just disappeared ... I’m afraid for my family and for my life. It’s dangerous to go outside.”Asked if he was a follower of Gulen’s teachings, he said: “Answering this question could now be used as evidence against me. Now I could be prosecuted for a book I keep at home ... Everyone is too afraid to call their friends, worried this will cause their detention. It’s a climate of fear everywhere.”ALLIES TURNED FOESErdogan was prime minister from 2003 until 2014, when he became president. When he first came to power, he led a reinvented Muslim conservative party wary of fiercely secularist generals and judges who had closed a series of Islamist parties.In the skirmishing that followed, and after the army and the courts tried to push aside the AKP in 2007-08, Erdogan turned for help to Gulen, whose movement had built a loyal following among police, prosecutors and civil servants.Gulen, a Muslim imam self-exiled in Pennsylvania since 1999, has built a franchise of schools in Turkey and around the world, promoting the importance of education, scientific progress, religious coexistence and fighting poverty.After their ascent to power, Erdogan and the AKP became dependent on the Gulenists in their common fight against the army. It was mainly Gulenist prosecutors who, after Erdogan and his party narrowly escaped being banned in 2008, built two big conspiracy trials targeting the upper echelons of the army.These two cases, known as Ergenekon and Sledgehammer, netted more than 40 generals, but also swept up opponents of both the ruling party and the Gulenists. It later became clear after many charges were dismissed that bogus evidence had been used.Yet at the time, the Gulenists’ apparent success in helping Erdogan break the army’s grip on Turkish politics emboldened them to demand more power in the security services and the army.“It is essentially not a struggle about ideology because their ideology is so similar. Both want to turn Turkey into a more conservative Islamised society,” said one Turkey analyst who asked not to be named after the declaration of emergency laws which could hit those critical of the state.“It is a struggle about power and that alliance broke down because of disagreement over power-sharing.”PURSUIT OF POWERIf Gulenist penetration of state institutions is as deep as the purges suggest, then much of it must have happened while Erdogan was in charge.“We never considered even the possibility that they might be involved in this kind of a treason. They were citizens of our country and we supported them to the fullest as citizens of our country,” Erdogan told Reuters.Sener said there had been a tendency to see Gulen as a religious leader, but he has always rejected this.“He is a man who is in pursuit of power and power alone. Fethullah Gulen and his followers want to take over the organs of the state,” he said.“Had (Erdogan) taken this seriously he would have cleaned this up years ago. But he never imagined the guns would be turned on him.”The struggle between the former allies started in late 2011.Erdogan had been re-elected that summer for a third term as prime minister, making no secret of his presidential ambitions. His posters emphasized power until 2023, the centenary of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk’s founding of the modern republic.But when he suddenly had to pull back from the political fray and undergo surgery, prosecutors assumed to be loyal to Gulen targeted Hakan Fidan, Erdogan’s intelligence chief.This apparent attempt to push Gulenist influence into the security services was like targeting Erdogan himself, who complained of betrayal, asking publicly: “What is it that we didn’t give you that you wanted?”Tit-for-tat battles followed, electrifying Turkish politics. The government closed down the dershane, a network of private tutoring centers, mostly run by the movement. Gulenist prosecutors in 2013 launched corruption investigations into Erdogan’s cabinet and family. The gloves came off.END OF THE MOVEMENT?This degree of state infiltration, and the damaging leaks by prosecutors, revealed a power structure Erdogan loyalists described as a “parallel state” intent on taking power.“It has aspirations to capture the state. They certainly came quite a long way in reaching this objective, they have certainly been helped and assisted by the AKP,” said Sinan Ulgen, head of the liberal EDAM think tank in Istanbul and a fellow at the Carnegie Europe think tank.“When AKP came to power they established an alliance. It helped to populate the Turkish administration with Gulenists.”Government officials say the Gulenists have carefully planned to seize state institutions for over three decades by using their schools and universities to prepare civil servants, something the AKP found difficult to match when it took power.Gulen schools have identified and groomed generations of capable students, starting from primary schools through university and into their professional life. Many rose to influential jobs in the state and business.“This is the more benign face of the movement but there is a dark face,” Ulgen said, adding that it has steadily become more powerful over the past decade and succeeded in penetrating bodies such as the police, judiciary and prosecution service.Sener said government hotlines set up for people to inform on suspected Gulenists meant the movement looked set for a fall.“This movement will end,” said Sener. “There are a few who are still hidden... To a very large extent, this is the end of the Gulen movement in Turkey.” (Writing by Samia Nakhoul, Editing by Nick Tattersall and Timothy Heritage)"

This may not please everybody, but this result is one which is respecting the rules of justice and all the clean athletes all over the world.”WADA and 14 national anti-doping organisations had urged the IOC to impose a blanket ban in the wake of the damning McLaren report, but former Olympic fencing champion Bach said that Russian sportsmen and women “will have to clear the highest hurdle to take part in the Olympics”.‘CONFUSING MESS’The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said the IOC had failed to show leadership with its decision.“Many, including clean athletes and whistleblowers, have demonstrated courage and strength in confronting a culture of state-supported doping and corruption within Russia,” USADA chief Travis Tygart said.“Disappointingly, however, in response to the most important moment for clean athletes and the integrity of the Olympic Games, the IOC has refused to take decisive leadership. The decision regarding Russian participation and the confusing mess left in its wake is a significant blow to the rights of clean athletes.”Russia’s Sports Minister, Vitaly Mutko, said the decision cleared the way for Russian participation.“I hope that the majority of international federations will very promptly confirm the right of (Russian) sportspeople in different types of sports to take part in the Olympic Games,” Mutko said.The International Tennis Federation wasted no time in clearing the seven Russian players nominated for Rio. The ITF said the players have been subject to a rigorous anti-doping programme outside Russia, which it considers sufficient to meet the IOC’s requirements.SPOTLESS RECORD REQUIREDFor individuals to be allowed to compete at Rio they must have a spotless international record on drug testing, the IOC said, adding athletes who have been sanctioned in the past for doping will not be eligible.That would dash the hopes of middle-distance runner Yulia Stepanova, the whistleblower and former drug cheat whose initial evidence led to one of the biggest doping scandals in decades.The IOC had said this week that it would not organise or give patronage to any sports event in Russia and that no member of the Russian Sports Ministry implicated in the McLaren report would be accredited for Rio.It also ordered the immediate re-testing of all Russian athletes from the Sochi Olympics.Though a series of international federations, anti-doping agencies and athletes have since called for a blanket ban, some have said they are against punishing innocent athletes.“It would be quite difficult for us to think we should ban an entire team, which will include some cyclists who are not implicated in any of these stories we’ve been hearing,” said Brian Cookson, president of the International Cycling Union.“We’re going to have to look at it case by case, rider by rider and team by team. At the end of the day, Russians are not the only sportsmen or women who have been found doping.”Russian officials and government officers have said the doping allegations are part of a Western conspiracy against their country.Russian President Vladimir Putin had warned that the affair could split the Olympic movement, bringing echoes of the 1980s. The United States led a political boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games and the Soviet Union led an Eastern Bloc boycott of the Los Angeles Games four years later.(Additional reporting by Steve Tongue, Gene Cherry and Jack Stubbs; Editing by David Goodman)"

He said it was “a game played by nearly every known rampage killer.”The gunman - identified by sources as David Sonboly - called himself “Ali” and once described the 17-year-old killer in the 2009 attack as a good person, according to a 16-year-old youth with whom he played video games in an online club, the German magazine Spiegel reported.He frequently used online video handles such as “Hate” and “Rampage Killer,” expressed nationalistic views, and was eventually excluded from the club because the other members were afraid of him, the magazine cited the other youth as saying.“We always expected something like what happened, but we never thought he could get a gun and then use it,” he said.The gunman was also evidently inspired by Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik, and likely deliberately staged the shooting on the fifth anniversary of Breivik’s massacre of 77 people, Heimberger said.Bavaria’s chief prosecutor Thomas Steinhaus-Koch said the gunman was treated for anxiety and been hospitalized for psychiatric treatment from July to September 2015, followed by out-patient treatment as recently as last month.Investigators also found prescription medicines at his home, where he lived with his parents and younger brother.He had made reference to his hospitalization in a heated exchange that was videotaped immediately after the shooting.“I am German,” he yelled at a bystander in a nearby apartment house after he yelled a racial slur and threw a beer bottle. “Because of you I was bullied for seven years.”Officials said authorities had investigated allegations in 2012 that the gunman was bullied by three other children, but none of those individuals - or any other classmates of the gunman - were among the shooting victims.Nor did the victims include anyone who commented on a fake Facebook page created by the gunman in May, using photographs and the name of a young Turkish woman, the officials said. He had invited people to free food at the McDonald’s restaurant at 4 p.m. local time, shortly before the shooting began.Heimberger said the gunman likely purchased his weapon - a reactivated Glock 17 pistol - on the shadowy dark net area of the Internet.He said it was unclear when he bought the gun, or how he paid for it, adding that the parents of the gunman remained in shock and were not able to be interviewed."

On his first flight age three months, it was easy (I now realize). He was completely immobile and I was his entire world. For the duration of the flight, he just wanted to be held by me and breastfeed. As long as I had an emergency bag prepared, we were fine. Today at age 3 plus, he’s back to being easy again provided there is entertainment on the flight and that he isn’t confined to his seat for the entire trip. Over the past few years there have been some ups and downs.Due to living abroad and my husband’s job, our toddler has clocked over 30 flights (my count includes every leg of a trip so every take off and landing). I’ve received a lot of excellent advice and wanted to catalogue some of what I’ve learned. Meanwhile, I am still processing the fact that I didn’t have my passport until my late teens/early 20s and my son had and used his by three months.Pack ListYou should have an emergency bag of baby clothes with multiple changes depending on the accessibility of your suitcase. This is where the slipper socks come in handy. Weighing less than 5 ounces a pair, these are awesome to pack. (I have him wear some and take some when I dress him before getting on the plane.) Bring lots of diapers or pull-ups, wipes (lots and lots of wipes), creams, blanket, hand sanitizer (if you are against sanitizers use a small bottle with soapy water), Baby Tylenol or Advil, drinking vessels and food options. (Note: make sure you pack medicine, food and drink options in a separate ziplock to present to Homeland Security). Take at least one extra shirt for you and if you have room a pair of pants.  As far as toys to bring and things to keep them occupied, think about their developmental level and give them a few surprises. For a long time, I could just bring soft tactile toys that he could play with and throw around ― now it is small books, cars, toy figures, train engines, regular stickers, drawing stuff and reusable stickers (Melissa and Doug have some great ones that kept our son busy while we hung out for seven hours in an airport in St. Thomas). There are tons of magnetic toys like @tegu where you don’t need to worry as much about losing things. We also use an iPad with tons of apps and videos, which I know some people will not want to do. Before a trip I generally download new age appropriate shows or apps and order (or grab from the excess toy stash) a few new toys and books. Pre-Potty Trained:I would empty and pack away my diaper bag because it wasn’t enough space to bring everything I needed and instead used a soft bag like a Longchamp bag. I liked to take dog poop bags or ziplock bags to dispose of dirty diapers and the unending stream of trash we seem to create. I included a diaper changing pad and possibly a larger baby blanket as airplane bathrooms are often hideous places to change a child. (One flight attendant informed me that I had to change my six month old only in the airplane bathroom, which I readily agreed to only to discover that there was no diaper changing area. He thought I could just throw the kid on top of the toilet seat or do it on the bathroom floor. Note to self: Never agree to anything when it comes to baby.) When he was breastfeeding, I figured people would prefer to catch sight of my breasts rather than hear a baby scream for two to eight hours so I always had a breastfeed as much as he wanted rule on planes. (Happily, I never had to use the just in case response I had for potential hecklers: “This is actually what breasts are for, they are not just for motor boating.”) Obviously you want your child breastfeeding or doing something that requires swallowing so his/her ears don’t hurt on take offs and landings. We also make a game of yawning during take offs and landings so his ears will pop. We also set things up for potential sleep by putting him in his pajamas or leaving him in his pajamas for most flights even in the mornings. People seem much more open to us and amused by him when he is in footy pajamas. It’s an AdventureFlying can be stressful but we try to cut down on that message and instead present the flight and trip as an adventure. He’s always been interested in people so he really enjoys public spaces. We try to get as much energy out in the airport before boarding the flight. I’ve read where parents bring little candy packets to hand out to people on planes with an explanation that your little one doesn’t really fly and please be kind. These packets often include offers of earplugs. I kept meaning to do this but I never did and I guess I figure at this age we are past the phase. Of course, each trip could prove me wrong. Instead, we try to engage the people around us with the little guy and let them all talk and chat. I try to give off a “we’re all in this together, so we can make it” vibe, which with a few exceptions has worked well. People have offered to carry our bags, get our things from the overhead, hold my son, help with the stroller and they have stepped in at other various points along the way. One thing we learned to do is if we are traveling together as a family, we book the aisle and window seat and let someone else sit in between us. If there are empty seats somewhere else on the plane, your middle seater is more likely to move to an empty seat even if it is another middle seat. If there aren’t empty seats, we wait until the plane is completely full and offer to change seats. (If you offer to switch before, most likely they won’t move from their new aisle or window seat to a middle seat elsewhere on the plane.) If I am traveling alone with the kiddo, I ask the stewardess to move whomever sits next to me, which they usually try to do. I always try to book the window seat so that he is trapped. Some people prefer the opposite so that they have easy access to the aisles or bathrooms but my son sees the aisle as an invitation, which doesn’t always work.And finally when booking your flight remember children usually are happiest and therefore fly better in the morning. We’ve had to fly overnight multiple times and discovered that our son rarely sleeps much or at all. He is just too excited. That means I don’t get that precious sleep I desperately need.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) took to the streets Sunday in advance of the Democratic convention, kicking off a week of planned protests. “I felt he worked so hard for the 99 percent, I could do my little bit and come to the convention to [get out] two messages: to still support him and also protest the Democratic National Committee,” said Paula Iaesella, a woman from southern New Hampshire carrying a “Still Bernie” sign.Sanders backers endured intense sun and temperatures in the high 90s to march through the center of Philadelphia Sunday afternoon. Many of them had just marched for clean energy earlier in the day.The only person less popular than Hillary Clinton at the rally was Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who had just stepped down as convention chair after leaked emails came out suggesting DNC staff favored Clinton over Sanders. For Sanders supporters, the emails proved what they had believed all along ― that despite public pronouncements of neutrality, the Democratic establishment was helping Clinton. “I think it was about time and long past due for her to be gone,” said Leslie Ann “Lacy” Copley-Gorman, from Bruceton Mills, West Virginia. “We knew from the beginning that it was not fair to Bernie. We’ve been saying it all along.”“Thank God,” said Janice Blanchard of Denver. Pittsburgh resident Adam Bluebaugh was carrying a “Fire Debbie!” sign during the march. “I think she should be fired,” Bluebaugh said. “I think if they really want to unify the party, that would be a big step. Clearly she just rigged the whole thing.”Bluebaugh’s wish came true later in the day when Wasserman Schultz announced she was stepping down as DNC chair.In a statement, Sanders said she made the “right decision” and called for new leadership that will “open the doors of the party and welcome in working people and young people.”Wasserman Schultz will now serve as honorary chair of the Clinton campaign’s 50-state program.The email leaks, Wasserman Schultz’s resignation and the protests were likely not the message Democrats wanted heading into their convention. A plane flew over the protesters flying a banner reading “Hillary for prison,” which elicited cheers from the people on the ground. It was sponsored by Infowars.com, the conspiracy theorist website run by Alex Jones.Steffanie Greer, who was carrying a “Hillary for prison” sign, said she believes Clinton should absolutely be locked up for using a private server as secretary of state. “I believe that if she were not Hillary Clinton, she would be in prison. I think that would be justice, and I believe in justice,” Greer said.Iasella, however, wasn’t so sure. “I don’t know about prison, but she definitely needed to be indicted,” she said. “That was ridiculous that the FBI said she mishandled secret documents extremely carelessly and didn’t recommend an indictment. That totally destroys all the trust we have in our government.” Sanders supporters have a full lineup of protests planned for the week, including events called “Occupy the DNC Convention,” “Bernie or Bust Rally,” “Shut Down the DNC!” and “Mass Civil Disobedience at the DNC.” There will also be a rally for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, a favorite of Sanders supporters.They were chanting “Hell no, DNC, we won’t vote for Hillary” ― even though some marchers admitted that in the end, they may end up voting for Clinton just to stop Trump.Trump has been making a play to win over Sanders voters, even mentioning them in his acceptance speech last week at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. “I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders ― he never had a chance,” Trump said. “But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works for all Americans.”But Sanders supporters at the march Sunday laughed off the suggestion that they would ever back Trump.“No way. He’s a dog off a leash,” Copley-Gorman said. “I think he is pitiful,” added Delaware resident Eric Morrison. “I won’t be voting for Trump or Hillary.”For his part, Sanders said Sunday that he is fully behind Clinton and that the DNC email leaks have not changed his support.“My job right now is to see that Donald Trump is defeated, Hillary Clinton is elected,” Sanders said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He also rejected the overtures Trump is making to his supporters. “In terms of who could be trusted, I think the evidence is clear that there has been no candidate that I have ever seen that lies more often than does Donald Trump,” Sanders added. “That’s not just me saying it; that’s what any independent media analysis has shown. In terms of trust, you can’t trust a word I think that Mr. Trump has to say.”"

Supporters of the ruling religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) and others joined as well.“Political ideologies don’t mean anything today,” said 28-year-old Yagiz as he stood in a crimson sea of fluttering Turkish flags and banners portraying Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey. “We are here for our nation.”The interpreter and member of CHP’s youth branch wiped sweat from his brow in the brutal July heat.At least 246 people died in the July 15 coup attempt and its aftermath and thousands more were left injured.While many people who filled Taksim on Sunday were not supporters of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom critics increasingly call authoritarian, there has been widespread condemnation of the coup to overthrow his democratically elected government. Turkish political parties across the spectrum have united against the coup plot. Yagiz was one of many Turks who heeded Erdogan’s call to take to the streets on the night of July 15 when forces within the Turkish military attempted to take hold of the country. “It was like an apocalypse,” he recalled.Video footage from July 15 and 16 shows rebel-flown F16 fighter airplanes launching strikes on parliament, heavily armed soldiers shooting into crowds of protesters and tanks crushing people who stepped in front of them.Turkey’s government has credited loyal police, military and civilians for the coup’s failure.“Politics do not matter when there is a threat to Turkey’s sovereignty,” said Ibrahim Okur, a 23-year-old student who says he’s a supporter of AKP. “Turkey has been through several coups and no one wants Turkey to go through such a thing again.”“[There’s] one thing we have in common today,” he continued. “We are citizens of Turkey.”The Turkish government says a Pennsylvania-based cleric named Fethullah Gulen who leads an international following is behind the attempted power grab. Gulen, a onetime ally of Erdogan turned his bitter enemy, is considered to be a terrorist leader by the Turkish state. Erdogan has, for years, claimed that Gulen attempted to infiltrate and dismantle the government.Turkey has demanded Gulen’s extradition, though U.S. officials say they have to receive sufficient evidence and follow a formal legal process.Some Turks believe that the U.S. government was behind the coup attempt, in which Erdogan says he was nearly assassinated. President Barack Obama slammed the conspiracy theory as “completely false, unequivocally false.”Mere hours after the coup failed, Turkey began rooting out accused collaborators and Turkish leaders vowed to purge the country of coup plotters. So far, over 60,000 educators, lawyers, judges, police, soldiers and government workers have been detained, arrested, suspended or investigated. Erdogan has also ordered the closure of thousands of private schools, unions, charities, universities and medical institutions.Turkey announced a state of emergency on Thursday, one that is set to last at least three months, and said it would derogate ― that is, deviate ― from the European Convention on Human Rights.Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş has said “fundamental rights and freedoms and normal daily life” will not be harmed by the move, but some Turks say they fear they will be wrongfully accused and get swept up in the purge.Amnesty International said on Sunday that detainees are being beaten, tortured and raped in detention centers.“It is absolutely imperative that the Turkish authorities halt these abhorrent practices and allow international monitors to visit all these detainees in the places they are being held,” said John Dalhuisen, the organization’s Europe director.Despite the show of solidarity on Sunday, there was still an undertone of concern among many in Taksim over Turkey’s leadership and its future.“Democracy is a lifestyle, it’s not just voting,” said CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, who addressed the crowd from a stage and slammed the attempted power grab. “Democracy is respecting other people and respecting other identities.”“Coup plotters and dictators are blocking the media,” Kılıçdaroğlu added.Pro-coup forces raided television stations last Friday night in an attempt to silence media outlets and the government has repeatedly cracked down on journalists critical of the Turkish state.

53,THE WORLDPOST,Thousands In Istanbul Put Aside Political Differences For Anti-Coup Solidarity Rally,Sophia Jones,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/istanbul-solidarity-rally-anti-coup_us_5791f5cee4b0fc06ec5c8e1c,"“Political ideologies don’t mean anything today,” said one Turkish man. “We are here for our nation.”",2016-07-24,Thousands of Turks gather at Istanbul's iconic Taksim Square July 24 to express condemnation for the bloody coup attempt.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579523892a00002d004f63ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ISTANBUL ― Thousands of Turkish men, women and children filled Istanbul’s iconic Taksim Square early Sunday evening, putting polarized politics behind them to rally in solidarity in the wake of the bloody July 15 coup attempt.Turks, mainly from the secular opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), flocked to the city’s central square. Supporters of the ruling religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) and others joined as well.“Political ideologies don’t mean anything today,” said 28-year-old Yagiz as he stood in a crimson sea of fluttering Turkish flags and banners portraying Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey. “We are here for our nation.”The interpreter and member of CHP’s youth branch wiped sweat from his brow in the brutal July heat.At least 246 people died in the July 15 coup attempt and its aftermath and thousands more were left injured.While many people who filled Taksim on Sunday were not supporters of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom critics increasingly call authoritarian, there has been widespread condemnation of the coup to overthrow his democratically elected government. Turkish political parties across the spectrum have united against the coup plot. Yagiz was one of many Turks who heeded Erdogan’s call to take to the streets on the night of July 15 when forces within the Turkish military attempted to take hold of the country. “It was like an apocalypse,” he recalled.Video footage from July 15 and 16 shows rebel-flown F16 fighter airplanes launching strikes on parliament, heavily armed soldiers shooting into crowds of protesters and tanks crushing people who stepped in front of them.Turkey’s government has credited loyal police, military and civilians for the coup’s failure.“Politics do not matter when there is a threat to Turkey’s sovereignty,” said Ibrahim Okur, a 23-year-old student who says he’s a supporter of AKP. “Turkey has been through several coups and no one wants Turkey to go through such a thing again.”“[There’s] one thing we have in common today,” he continued. “We are citizens of Turkey.”The Turkish government says a Pennsylvania-based cleric named Fethullah Gulen who leads an international following is behind the attempted power grab. Gulen, a onetime ally of Erdogan turned his bitter enemy, is considered to be a terrorist leader by the Turkish state. Erdogan has, for years, claimed that Gulen attempted to infiltrate and dismantle the government.Turkey has demanded Gulen’s extradition, though U.S. officials say they have to receive sufficient evidence and follow a formal legal process.Some Turks believe that the U.S. government was behind the coup attempt, in which Erdogan says he was nearly assassinated. President Barack Obama slammed the conspiracy theory as “completely false, unequivocally false.”Mere hours after the coup failed, Turkey began rooting out accused collaborators and Turkish leaders vowed to purge the country of coup plotters. So far, over 60,000 educators, lawyers, judges, police, soldiers and government workers have been detained, arrested, suspended or investigated. Erdogan has also ordered the closure of thousands of private schools, unions, charities, universities and medical institutions.Turkey announced a state of emergency on Thursday, one that is set to last at least three months, and said it would derogate ― that is, deviate ― from the European Convention on Human Rights.Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş has said “fundamental rights and freedoms and normal daily life” will not be harmed by the move, but some Turks say they fear they will be wrongfully accused and get swept up in the purge.Amnesty International said on Sunday that detainees are being beaten, tortured and raped in detention centers.“It is absolutely imperative that the Turkish authorities halt these abhorrent practices and allow international monitors to visit all these detainees in the places they are being held,” said John Dalhuisen, the organization’s Europe director.Despite the show of solidarity on Sunday, there was still an undertone of concern among many in Taksim over Turkey’s leadership and its future.“Democracy is a lifestyle, it’s not just voting,” said CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, who addressed the crowd from a stage and slammed the attempted power grab. “Democracy is respecting other people and respecting other identities.”“Coup plotters and dictators are blocking the media,” Kılıçdaroğlu added.Pro-coup forces raided television stations last Friday night in an attempt to silence media outlets and the government has repeatedly cracked down on journalists critical of the Turkish state. AKP has ruled Turkey since 2002. Erdogan first served as the country’s prime minister for 11 years before winning the presidential seat in 2014. While the prime minister historically holds the most power, there is no doubt that Erdogan is now Turkey’s most powerful leader.“We are living in a dictatorship and I’m pretty sure everyone here is aware of that,” said Aysegul, a 22-year-old college student in Istanbul who came out to protest the coup attempt, which she said would have “taken all our freedoms from the people.”Both her parents, who flanked their daughter in the teeming crowd in Taksim, had taken part in the anti-government Gezi Park protests in 2013.Three years ago, they were dodging tear gas and rubber bullets fired by police.

They then narrowed the prescriptions down to ones that could be substituted with medical marijuana. Those prescriptions were for ailments that included anxiety, depression, glaucoma, nausea, pain, psychosis, seizures, sleep disorders and spasticity.Their results found that there were fewer prescriptions filled for the majority of those categories. The pain category, for instance, saw a decrease in 1,826 daily doses, while the depression category saw a 265 daily dosage decrease.As the researchers noted in their release, they specifically looked at glaucoma patients’ use of marijuana.“It turns out that glaucoma is one of the most Googled searches linked to marijuana, right after pain,” Dr. David Bradford of the university’s School of Public & International Affairs, who co-authored the report, stated in the university’s release.The eye disease can be extremely painful and lead to blindness for some patients.

Because of that, they stated that they fully expected prescription drug use to remain strong for the disease even when marijuana was an available alternative.As the university’s release notes, “they were not disappointed.”Though there were fewer drug prescriptions written for the other ailments, the daily doses of prescribed glaucoma medications increased, they stated.That led them to believe that medical marijuana users are not requesting prescriptions just to enjoy a high, but are basing their decision on medical needs.“The results suggest people are really using marijuana as medicine and not just using it for recreational purposes,” the study’s lead author, Ashley Bradford, who completed her bachelor’s degree in sociology in May, said in a statement.Speaking in a recent YouTube interview, Bradford expressed hope “that this research will influence and reform policymaking.”Decreasing Americans’ use of prescription drugs may not just be of monetary benefit, but depending on the type of drug, could help fight Americans’ addiction to prescription painkillers as well.The U.S. is in the midst of an opioid overdose epidemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In 2014 alone, opioids ― including prescription opioid pain relievers and heroin ― killed more than 28,000 people, more than any year on record. At least half of all those deaths involved a prescription opioid. “We now know that overdoses from prescription opioid pain relievers are a driving factor in the 15-year increase in opioid overdose deaths,” the CDC states on their website. “Since 1999, the amount of prescription opioids sold in the U.S. nearly quadrupled, yet there has not been an overall change in the amount of pain that Americans report.”Three of the most common prescription drugs involved in opioid overdose deaths were methadone, oxycodone and hydrocodone.Today, 25 states and Washington, D.C., have some form of legalized medical marijuana.
