0,POLITICS,House Passes Legislation To Help Puerto Rico Restructure Its $70 Billion In Debt,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-bill-puerto-rico-debt_us_5759bf6be4b0e39a28aceea8,"The bill was a compromise between Republicans concerned it was a ""bailout"" and Democrats who wanted it to contain more progressive economic provisions.",2016-06-09,House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) helped usher legislation through the House to establish an oversight board to work with the Puerto Rican government on restructuring its debt and recovering economically.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Legislation that would give Puerto Rico the power to restructure its $70 billion in debt cleared the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday.It’s not the bill anyone wanted, especially Democrats, but with the commonwealth facing a massive $2 billion debt payment on July 1, both parties rallied behind it in a 297-127 vote. The bill, which establishes an oversight board to work with the government of Puerto Rico in restructuring its debt and crafting an economic recovery plan, will now head to the Senate. Puerto Rico is struggling to keep afloat as the exodus from the island has reached record numbers, and the health care and education systems continue to crumble as a result of the economic crisis brought on by the crippling debt. Passage came after months of haggling between Republicans, Democrats and the administration, with everyone finally reaching a consensus after three drafts of the bill. It's a win for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who had to go back and forth with conservative members wary the legislation would provide a “bailout” for the island -- which is home to 3.5 million Americans. Making a final push ahead of the vote Thursday, Ryan dismissed claims that the bill would give the island bailout powers, calling it ""absolutely, undeniably, categorically false.""""Puerto Rico is in trouble and we need to act now,"" he said. ""If we do nothing it could be a manmade humanitarian disaster.""A number of conservatives in Republican ranks opposed the bill, worried that it would set a dangerous precedent and cost taxpayers. House leadership pushed back, and appeared to win over enough of their members to get the bill across the finish line.A handful of progressives in both chambers haven’t warmed to the bill either, but passage came as no surprise as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic leaders in the House indicated support for the legislation early on. Thursday's passage was a win for Pelosi as well as Democrats carried the vote with 158 backing the bill compared to Republicans' 139.Pelosi said that the bill “represents a compromise” and she will make sure those appointed to the oversight board understand the importance of voting for restructuring. Democrats wanted to include provisions that would have protected pensions for Puerto Rican retirees in the debt restructuring, and one raising the island's minimum wage, among others. In a concession to Democrats, Republicans removed a provision from the bill that would have approved the land transfer of 3,100 acres of the Vieques National Wildlife Refuge from the Interior Department to the Puerto Rican government. The control board, however, is the biggest point of contention for progressives and lawmakers in the commonwealth, who argue it gives too much power to Republicans, who are able to appoint four of the seven that will sit on it. ""The reality is the urgency in Puerto Rico, the humanitarian needs on the island make us look at this bill not with an eye toward perfection but with an eye toward what is doable,"" Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said on the House floor ahead of the vote. Pelosi and Grijalva thanked Rep. Pedro Pierluisi -- who represents the commonwealth but does not get a vote in Congress -- and Reps. Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.) and Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.). All three were key in convincing the Democratic caucus that the legislation was one they should back.""The difficulties facing the island are substantial and the blame for them can be spread from San Juan to Washington, DC to Wall Street,"" Velazquez said in a statement issued hours before the vote. ""But for me, in the present and as a proud Puerto Rican, I cannot sit by and do nothing. I cannot hide behind alternatives that do not exist."""

The announcement is a sign of major progress in the struggle of HIV-positive Americans to be publicly accepted. If elected to represent the 10th Congressional District, Poe apparently would be the first member of Congress openly living with the virus.Poe said he shared his diagnosis in order to help “remove the fear and the stigma and the shame that goes with” HIV, factors that often prevent people from getting proper testing and treatment.“I have a motto in my life: ‘If you want to make a difference, you have to be the difference,’” Poe said. “And so today, I am trying to be the difference in this community so that we can begin to solve this problem, once and forever.”Poe, who is openly gay, said he decided to go public after a conversation with a woman in his community who expressed despair at learning that she had the virus that causes AIDS.The woman “thought she had a death sentence,” Poe recounted. “I told her that she didn’t, and I even shared with her where she could go get the resources that she needed.“But I really just wanted to hug her and let her know that she wasn’t alone because I too had HIV, but I was still hung up in the fear and the stigma that surrounds this condition,” Poe added.Poe said he contracted HIV in 1998 and remains in good health, thanks to early detection and treatment. Until Thursday's announcement, only family members knew about his condition, Poe said.“My doctors tell me that in all likelihood I am going to die of a ripe old age of something very normal,” Poe said.Poe is running a progressive campaign, pushing for a $15 minimum wage and gun-safety measures. He faces a crowded field in the Aug. 30 Democratic primary. Opponents include state Sen. Geraldine Thompson, ex-Orlando police Chief Val Demings and lawyer Fatima Fahmy.The 10th District became heavily Democratic after a state judge redrew district boundaries to comply with an amendment to the state constitution barring politically motivated gerrymandering. The incumbent, GOP Rep. Daniel Webster, is running in a neighboring district.Prior to getting involved in politics, Poe achieved success as an entrepreneur, according to his campaign web site. He has a daughter, Virginia, and lives with his spouse, Ken Brown, in Orlando, according to the site."

5,POLITICS,What Was Paul Ryan Thinking?,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-thinking-donald-trump_us_5758675be4b0e39a28ac44e1,"Inside the speaker's decision to endorse a man who, by his own admission, says racist things.",2016-06-09,House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) suggested Thursday that one reason he endorsed Trump was that he “won fair and square.”,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575996a615000030001b892c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- If these are the times that try Republican souls, what are we to make of Speaker Paul Ryan?The Wisconsin Republican, fresh off endorsing Donald Trump, called out the presumptive GOP nominee Tuesday for ""sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment."" Ryan said he wasn't ""even going to pretend to defend"" the businessman's statement that Judge Gonzalo Curiel should recuse himself from ruling on a Trump University case because of his Mexican heritage.Yet right after calling those comments ""unacceptable,"" Ryan proceeded to accept Trump. He said Hillary Clinton wasn't the answer and that Republicans were better off with Trump in the White House to sign the legislation they send him. The New York Daily News perfectly summed up the whiplash on a planned front page they drafted: ""I'm With Racist.""Supporter-of-the-guy-who-says-racist-things is not a fantastic look for Ryan, who's presented himself as the serious, policy-driven adult in the GOP. But in conversations with members, aides and people close to Ryan, the speaker's confidants insist he's played the Trump endorsement as best he could -- future of our republic be damned.It's important to understand that Trump was clearly not Ryan's first choice, according to these sources. That point was probably clear enough when, after months of saying he'd support the GOP nominee, Ryan went on CNN and said he wasn't ready to endorse Trump ""at this point.""By holding off, Ryan managed to introduce some daylight between himself, Trump and, consequently, House Republicans. Ryan said he wanted to have real unity in the party, not just ""fake unity,"" which would presumably occur if the speaker just pretended to support Trump.Four weeks later, with Trump's tone perhaps even worse, Ryan endorsed him, prompting the question: What changed?Ryan himself suggested recently that one big difference was the two had spoken. They met in person once, had a couple more phone calls and their staffs were in communication nearly every day, talking about Ryan and the House GOP's agenda.The speaker also suggested Thursday that one reason he endorsed Trump was that he ""won fair and square.""That's all well and good. But by Ryan's own admission, he's now pushing for a guy who says racist things to become the most powerful leader in the world. Clearly, there's more to this.According to those sources close to Ryan, a big part of the endorsement was the effect that the speaker not endorsing would have on Republicans down-the-ballot.""If we tell Republicans its OK to stay home this fall, we could be looking at complete Democratic control of Washington, which has real consequences for all the things we believe in,"" a source close to Ryan told The Huffington Post.Ryan's calculation was that it's better to get behind Trump and try to motivate Republicans to get to the polls than to create a rift, give the reality TV personality an excuse for his loss and simultaneously create a Democratic wave that could hand Clinton the House and Senate. That's what Ryan is trying to prevent. Better, in his thinking, to half-heartedly support Trump, continue calling him out for the outrageous, offensive, sometimes dangerous things he says, and, after the GOP nominee loses, have the party point to the businessman as the problem, not the establishment Republicans who didn't get onboard.There's also perhaps an even more political calculation to that political calculation, though Ryan's confidants don't want to talk about it. If Ryan is going to run for president in 2020, he needs those Trump voters -- or, at least, he needs to not ostracize them. Ryan might win some points with moderates by withholding his endorsement, but he probably wins those votes back anyway. His refusal to immediately jump into bed with Trump was a signal to those voters where he really stands.It's much more difficult to win back the Trump voters -- whatever constituency it is that they represent -- than the establishment folks who are naturally in Ryan's camp.Another big component to Ryan's thinking is his current position in the Republican Party.""Unless something crazy happens, it’s going to become clear before long that there are only really two options here,"" that same source close to Ryan said. ""You’re either for Trump or you’re for Clinton and the Republican speaker of the House can’t be for Clinton.""Refusing to endorse Trump would have almost certainly made a speaker coup in January more likely. Perhaps, with an aggressive campaign by Trump -- just think of the tweets! -- Ryan may have been forced to resign his position before the election. All that would have accomplished, of course, is proving to voters that the GOP truly is Trump's party, overt racism, xenophobia, misogyny and all.Of course, there's also the straightforward explanation that Ryan provided in his op-ed: He doesn't want Clinton to be president.That seems to be the explanation members believe and offer themselves. ""I think Paul finally got to the point where he thought that his policies have a better chance of moving forward with Trump than with Clinton,"" said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), summing up a common thought.Members don't fault Ryan for his endorsement. ""Ryan did what he had to do,"" retiring Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.) said. ""I mean, you have to stand for party unity. I mean, it's like the old adage, either we hang together or hang separately.""None of the 15 Republican members HuffPost talked to thought Ryan had actually achieved the ""real unity"" he said he desired with Trump. ""In that situation, I think Paul did what he felt like he had to do,"" Salmon said.But there's also an advantage to not finding real unity. The two Republican leaders are unlikely to be hugging any time soon, sure, but it wouldn't be odd to see them shaking hands. Ryan and Trump are at an arms-length distance. And even if Ryan's support for Trump is haunting him, even if he displayed to some voters the very fecklessness Trump accused Washington politicians of being guilty of, at least it's clear to the careful observer that this unity is less than genuine.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
6,POLITICS,Supreme Court Deals Blow To Puerto Rican Government -- And Gives Hope To Puerto Rico,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-puerto-rico_us_57597cc5e4b00f97fba768e2,"The commonwealth is ""sovereign,"" sure, but still highly dependent on Congress.",2016-06-09,"Justice Elena Kagan was the author of the majority opinion in Puerto Rico v. Sanchez-Valle, a low-profile case that could nonetheless have political repercussions in Puerto Rico.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57599c142200002d00f801b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a case that is widely seen as critical for the political fate of 3.5 million Puerto Ricans, the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday avoided grand pronouncements about Puerto Rico's constitutional status, but made it clear that the commonwealth ultimately answers to the U.S. Congress.The case, Puerto Rico v. Sanchez-Valle, has at once nothing and everything to do with politics. But Puerto Ricans both on the island and in the U.S. were watching it closely for clues as to what it might spell for the commonwealth's status -- which is in flux more than ever, as a result of local instability and crippling debt.With a resounding voice, the Supreme Court ruled 6-2 that ""the oldest roots of Puerto Rico’s power... lie in federal soil."" Which is an elegant way of saying that Puerto Rico is not a fully autonomous, self-governing body, but rather an amorphous no-man's-land largely dependent on the United States.The unlikely case stemmed from a rather mundane criminal appeal by the Puerto Rican government, which was seeking to prosecute two convicted gun runners whom the U.S. government had already prosecuted in a Puerto Rico federal court.Local officials were interested in prosecuting the defendants, too -- but the two men, Luis Sánchez Valle and Jaime Gómez Vázquez, raised as a defense the Constitution's double jeopardy clause, which generally bars two separate prosecutions for ""the same offense.""In a controversial ruling replete with politically charged language, the liberal high court of Puerto Rico agreed with the defendants, leading the Puerto Rican government to mount a fierce appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. (While the case was pending, the Puerto Rican governor threw a fit about a brief the federal government submitted to the court.)And in a major blow to the current government of Puerto Rico, the Supreme Court upheld that decision -- ruling that local prosecutors cannot go after the two men because the island's power to prosecute is ultimately derived from Congress.""Back of the Puerto Rican people and their Constitution, the 'ultimate' source of prosecutorial power remains the U.S. Congress, just as back of a city’s charter lies a state government,"" wrote Justice Elena Kagan for the majority.To reach that conclusion, Kagan cited Puerto Rico's history and its relationship with the United States -- how it became a territory of the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War; how Congress gradually granted authority to the island under various laws; and how the passage of Public Law 600, in the 1950s, authorized a limited form of self-government for Puerto Rico.That law gave Puerto Ricans a certain kind of ""sovereignty"" -- the ability to draft and ratify their own constitution and more or less ""make large-scale choices about their own political institutions."" But Kagan was clear that that doesn't mean the commonwealth is wholly autonomous. ""Congress, in Public Law 600, authorized Puerto Rico’s constitution-making process in the first instance,"" she wrote. ""The people of a territory could not legally have initiated that process on their own.""""Put simply,"" she went on, ""Congress conferred the authority to create the Puerto Rico Constitution, which in turn confers the authority to bring criminal charges. That makes Congress the original source of power for Puerto Rico’s prosecutors -- as it is for the Federal Government’s. The island’s Constitution, significant though it is, does not break the chain.""Congress, in other words, is the body that provides ""the indispensable stamp of approval"" for Puerto Rico's affairs. And that means the two men at the center of the case, having already been prosecuted by the United States, can't be prosecuted again by Puerto Rico for illegal gun sales.This language, removed from the criminal context, is absolutely brutal to those in Puerto Rico who cling to the status quo, and could very likely fuel political action in favor of Puerto Rican statehood -- a path that could allow the island to emerge from its fiscal hole, bring stability to its residents and give it representation in Congress.There's language elsewhere in the opinion -- about Puerto Rico's ""wide-ranging self-rule"" and its ability to aspire to ""a wide variety of futures"" -- that's sure to be fodder for these conversations, even as Congress weighs legislation to help Puerto Rico survive or at least ride out its nearly $70 billion in debt. (The Supreme Court has yet to rule in a separate case dealing with part of this debt.)Notably, Justice Sonia Sotomayor -- who is of Puerto Rican descent -- dissented from the court's majority but did not write her own opinion. Instead, she joined Justice Stephen Breyer, whose reading of Puerto Rico's history, and its decades of symbiosis with the United States, led him to conclude that the island is owed greater sovereignty than the majority of justices seemed to acknowledge.""This history of statutes, language, organic acts, traditions, statements, and other actions, taken by all three branches of the Federal Government and by Puerto Rico, convinces me that... the 'source' of Puerto Rico’s criminal law ceased to be the U.S. Congress and became Puerto Rico itself, its people, and its constitution,"" Breyer wrote.The Supreme Court, of course, doesn't have the final word about Puerto Rico's future. Only Congress -- and Puerto Ricans themselves -- will have to act."
7,BUSINESS,Donald Trump's Racism Actually Makes It Impossible For Him To Get The Working-Class Vote,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-working-class-racism_us_5758696fe4b0e39a28ac4858,Because math.,2016-06-09,Trump's alienated a huge swath of the working class with his racist rhetoric.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57583a371500002a007397db.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The American working class is becoming a lot less white, a new analysis reveals -- yet more evidence that the racist underpinnings of Donald Trump's campaign are not just morally abhorrent but, frankly, illogical.By 2032 a majority of the working class, defined as employed adults with less than a bachelor’s degree, will be people of color, according to projections based on labor department data that the Economic Policy Institute released Thursday. The change will come faster for younger working people. In just five years, people of color -- including Hispanics, Asian- and African-Americans -- will make up a majority of working-class adults ages 18-27.Today, people of color represent about 39 percent of the working class, according to EPI.In explaining Donald Trump’s rise to political prominence, writers for The New York Times, The Washington Post and other outlets have said that his biggest strand of support comes from angry working-class Americans fed up with an economy that is leaving them behind. Trump promises to bring back lost jobs from overseas and to somehow renegotiate trade deals that disadvantage American workers. But the reality TV star's unabashed use of racism in his campaign is alienating a huge swath of working people and pitting lower-income Americans against each other. “Trump is missing a large chunk of working class Americans,” Valerie Wilson, the EPI economist who authored the report, told The Huffington Post. “The strategy he is using is divisive. It makes it difficult for people to see how similar they are in terms of economic interest.”In other words, Trump's rhetoric hurts the very group he purports to want to rescue.A good part of Trump’s appeal is aimed straight at the working class, which has suffered for decades as the underpinnings of the U.S. economy have transformed from the manufacturing to the service sector. Factory jobs have vanished and more and more people with high school and associate degrees are landing at Walmart or other lower-paying service sector jobs.But Trump is also fueling the despair of the working class by fanning the flames of racial resentment. He has actually called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals; suggested that a judge’s race or ethnicity prevents him from issuing fair rulings; proposed the U.S., which was founded on the core principle of religious freedom, actually ban an entire religious group from entering the country. He’s also made bizarre comments calling one rally attendee “my African-American.”The voting data itself casts doubt on how much Trump actually appeals to the working classes. According to primary voting data analyzed by Nate Silver, Trump voters are in a higher income bracket. Trump's working class appeal is really just a white working-class appeal, George Packer writes in the New Yorker. But that appeal is straight-up misguided as, increasingly, the interests of the white working class are not really different from the interests of the African-American or Hispanic working class, Wilson's report notes.Regardless of race, the working class' biggest problem right now is wage stagnation. Pay is not going up for them -- even as the incomes of the country’s top earners continue to soar.For policy makers to truly address this rising income inequality, they’ll need to grapple with racial inequality, too.“The two become more closely linked as this demographic transition gets closer,” Wilson said.For example, black and Hispanic workers make less money per hour than their white counterparts. If this wage discrimination continues, Wilson said, that could mean yet more downward wage pressure for the working class.The only real solution would be for the entire group to come together to marshall its political power to change things, Wilson said. Wilson points to the success of the Fight for $15, the groups organizing for a hike in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. “Things are happening.”Notably, Trump has been wishy-washy on supporting a minimum wage increase -- despite saying he wants to improve prospects for working Americans. It's extremely unlikely that, a full year into his campaign, Trump is alienating nearly half of his supposed base simply out of ignorance. Instead, his tactics appear much more sinister and familiar: Pitting working-class Americans against each other, using race, instead of making progress on policies that could actually help them: Raising the minimum wage, creating a nationwide family leave law and offering better child care for working parents. “The divisive politics is really a smokescreen to really addressing the issues at hand,” Wilson said. “It plays on people’s biases instead of addressing economic issues head-on.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

That didn't stop Franzoni and producer Stephen Joel Brown from floating a couple possibilities to The Guardian's Kareem Shaheen, who reported that the filmmakers ""would like Leonardo DiCaprio to play Rumi, and Robert Downey Jr. to star as [Persian mystic] Shams of Tabriz.""Brown stated, ""This is the level of casting that we’re talking about.""Wow! What a level of casting! Two very white, very non-Persian men -- a strong show of non-commitment to diversity in casting and accuracy in portraying Rumi's life.As risk-averse as moviemakers are these days, a big-budget biopic with major studio support is exactly the kind of film that doesn't require a cast with major name-recognition to pull audiences. It's a star-making opportunity, a chance to cast some lesser-known talents and make their names. Needless to say, many reacted with outrage to the proposed casting of two white men as renowned Persian historical figures -- the tweets and think pieces flew:Then, Twitter made things worse.On Wednesday, the social media platform, or one of its partners, gathered tweets on the controversy into a ""Moment,"" to which it gave a clicky headline. (It's unclear who created the collection; though some media partners generate Moments on Twitter, many of them are created by Twitter itself.)No. Twitter, come on, now.This is not a debate with two sides, one side of which is ""bold casting"" and the other side of which is ""white-washing."" It's definitely white-washing -- it's pretty much the dictionary definition of it -- leaving the only thing to debate the reason two Hollywood industry players felt it wise or acceptable to discuss casting white actors as people of color.Is that reason ""boldness""? Twitter's Moment summary implies so, saying that ""Franzoni said he wants to challenge stereotypes by casting Leonardo DiCaprio as the Muslim scholar."" To be fair to Franzoni, even he didn't make such an absurdly causal claim -- he told The Guardian that he wanted to challenge Muslim stereotypes in the script and, separately, that he'd like to cast DiCaprio. In the Moment's framing, we're asked to consider the possibility that casting a white American star as a historically significant Persian Muslim poet would, in itself, be a bold challenge to stereotypes. This isn't just an absurd statement (white-washing a Middle Eastern figure in a Hollywood movie is the most obvious and tired choice ever); it's offensive, carrying a bizarre insinuation that we must see Muslims as blonde, white Americans to break down the stereotypes surrounding them. Reactions to this particular Hollywood gossip item carried a whiff of exhaustion and bafflement. Hasn't this been discussed to death? Didn't ""Aloha"" and ""Nina"" flop after very public criticism of the films' failure to cast actors who reflected the true racial identities and appearances of their characters? Didn't we already go through the problems with casting white people as Middle Eastern heroes, beat-by-beat, with ""Gods of Egypt"" and ""Exodus: Gods and Kings""? The rise of call-out culture and social media campaigns around Hollywood's diversity problem seemed to be finally raising real widespread awareness of the problem, and maybe even making it impossible for movie moguls to ignore. Maybe what was so disheartening about that Twitter Moment was seeing how quickly all that hard work by audiences to see themselves represented onscreen could be flipped on its head and turned into the conventional wisdom that studios ""boldly"" push against. Once, casting DiCaprio as Rumi might just have been defended as the best guy for the role, ""color-blind,"" or even a decision made in ignorance of the whitewashing problem. Now, with so much awareness of the issue, it's reframed as the gutsy, anti-establishment choice. Franzoni and Brown could go with the current conventional wisdom and cast a Persian actor, but nah, they're bold!Riffs on the painful Twitter Moment language, many jumping off the hashtag #BoldCastingDecision started by Brandon Taylor, made this framing all the more starkly awful:The rest of the world doesn't need to do Hollywood's spinning in the name of staying neutral. Doing the same safe, comfortable, exclusionary thing that's been done by the industry since it began is not, and never will be, a bold decision. "

The factory hasn’t been identified, but workers rescued him and he’s now in the care of Vale Wildlife Hospital in Tewkesbury, England, the BBC reports.He was uninjured, but he would have drowned in the thick liquid if no one had pulled him out, Lucy Kells, a veterinary nurse with the rescue center, told Wales Online. She said the vat was normally covered, but for some reason the lid was off that day.The photo of orange Gullfrazie is grabbing many people’s attention, but it couldn’t capture the strong scent of tikka masala.“The thing that shocked us most was the smell,” Kells told the Independent. “He smelled amazing, he smelled really good.”And while cleaning the orange color out of his feathers was easy, that smell has lingered for several days. Gullfrazie is ""feisty,"" Kells told The Huffington Post in an email, joking that he seems ""ungrateful"" for their help. Rescue center staff plans to keep him there until his feathers’ natural oils recover, after being somewhat depleted when they cleaned the sauce off. ""We expect him to stay with us another couple of weeks,"" Kells said. "" He is very thin, so we need to feed him up and get him stronger and then he needs time in an aviary to be able to preen and get his feathers waterproof and back in good condition.""Though some humans view seagulls as pests, the birds actually play an important role in the ecosystem. They help keep insect populations under control and consume organic waste, garbage and the decaying bodies of other animals. And while some people think it's kind of gross that seagulls wind up eating out of landfills, humans should probably consider who it was who created those landfills in the first place.""They didn't create the throwaway society,"" wrote naturalist Stephen Moss in a Guardian column on seagulls. ""We did, and they are simply reaping the benefits by grabbing a free lunch whenever they can.""This story has been updated with comments from Lucy Kells."

But if you were to pick one NFL player to lead a presidential ticket, Sherman would be pretty a deserving choice.Sherman proved that in an interview with Clayton on Monday, recommending a should-be-obvious plan for how to get America out of the red once more: Stop making the everyman and the everywoman foot the bill every time a billionaire rolls into a city and wants to erect the latest and greatest stadium.Thinking on his feet and improvising what he’d want his campaign slogan to be -- he settled on “Make America the place you want to raise your kids” -- Sherman put forth what he deemed to be a “pretty ingenious plan for our economy”: make the rich pay for their own toys.“I’d get us out of this deficit,” he told Clayton. “I’d stop spending billions of taxpayer dollars on stadiums and probably get us out of debt and maybe make the billionaires who actually benefit from the stadiums pay for them. That kind of seems like a system that would work for me.”Um, yes. The shtick of owners handing taxpayers the sky-high cost of state-of-the-art sports venues has irked effectively everyone in the 99 percent for a long while, but to avail for our collective wallet. The most recent, obscene example of this is the ongoing situation in St. Louis, as the city and state’s residents are still on the books for more than $100 million to pay for the Rams' stadium, even though the team divorced the district in favor of LA early this year.Suffice it to say that the stadium Sherman plays in is certainly not exempt from this exorbitance either. Seattle’s CenturyLink Field cost $300 million in taxpayer dollars alone -- despite the fact that franchise owner Paul Allen is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, as Deadspin aptly noted.Technically, Sherman won’t be old enough to qualify for the presidency for another seven years. But at least he already has a slogan and a platform.And, if you ask him, he believes he’s more than ready for the job.“I’d respectfully accept that nomination,” he said. “I think … I’d do a great job.”We’re still waiting to hear the cornerback’s plan for universal healthcare coverage."

Occidental's investigation started in 2013, at the beginning of a wave of activism around campus rape.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) met with Obama at the White House earlier in the day, and said afterward during a press conference that he would work to ensure presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not make it to the White House. Sanders did not endorse Clinton or say that he would withdraw from the race.Obama mentioned Sanders in his endorsement of Clinton, thanking the senator for ""shining a spotlight on issues like economic inequality and the outsized influence of money in our politics, and bringing young people into the process.""Obama emphasized that Clinton and Sanders have a shared vision of ""the values that make America great.""""Those are the values that are going to be tested in this election,"" he said.Clinton thanked Obama for his endorsement in a tweet:Trump reacted to Obama's endorsement in a tweet Thursday:Clinton quickly responded to his criticism with a tweet of her own:Clinton became the presumptive nominee on Monday, exceeding the 2,383 delegates required to be the party's choice on the November ballot, according to The Associated Press. She declared victory Tuesday evening, after winning primary contests in four states and earning a majority of pledged delegates in the race.Obama has hinted for months that he would endorse Clinton, but said it would be inappropriate to wade into the campaign until she clinched the nomination.He is set to campaign with Clinton in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on June 15.White House aides have said Obama is eager to defend Clinton against Trump. Obama has already begun assailing the former reality television star, sprinkling barbs against him into his recent speeches.Clinton, who served as Obama's secretary of state, is probably better equipped to preserve Obama's presidential legacy than Sanders. Clinton aligned herself with Obama's policies during the campaign, citing this as a reason primary voters should choose her over Sanders. Obama, referring to Clinton, acknowledged that ""on certain issues, she agrees with me more than Bernie does.""Obama has said he respects Sanders and his progressive platform. But in recent months, as Sanders' odds of winning grew longer, the president has hinted that the Vermont senator should cede the race to Clinton and allow the party to unite around her. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who competed against both Sanders and Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary, gave his endorsement shortly after Obama backed the former Secretary of State.""For the future of the country we carry in our hearts, I am committing my energies to the election of Secretary Clinton as the next President of the United States,"" O'Malley said in a statement. ""Democrats, Independents and Republicans alike must come together to confront the fascist threat to our democracy presented by Donald Trump. The stakes in this election could not be higher, and the choice is clear.""In February, Obama emphasized the importance of compromise and pragmatism in politics and warned against ideological absolutism.""When I hear voices in either party boast of their refusal to compromise as an accomplishment in and of itself, I’m not impressed,” Obama said. “All that does is prevent what most Americans would consider actual accomplishments, like fixing roads, educating kids, passing budgets, cleaning our environment, making our streets safe.""Clinton and Obama fought a bruising presidential primary battle in 2008, but mended ties. After conceding the race, Clinton campaigned for Obama in the general election. Obama offered her the secretary of state position, which she accepted after some hesitation. The two eventually developed a working partnership.Clinton often spoke on the campaign trail of how she put aside her differences with Obama to work in his administration.""Obviously, I'm excited about having the president's support,"" she said Monday. ""I have said throughout this campaign I was honored to serve in the president's cabinet as his secretary of state."""

His advisory lawyer could not be reached for comment following the verdict.Simcox, who represented himself in court throughout the trial, maintained his innocence against the charges for the alleged incidents in 2012 and 2013. He was arrested by Phoenix police in June 2013.Prosecutors said Simcox preyed on the 5-year-old girl, who was the friend of one of his daughters, during scheduled parental visits with his children. He also showed the victim explicit films, prosecutors said.“This young girl had the courage to come forward to stop the abuse and by doing so revealed his predatory behavior,” County Attorney Bill Montgomery said in a statement. “With this verdict we have been able to seek justice for this victim.”A former kindergarten teacher from California, Simcox helped start the border watch group to highlight what he said was the government's failure to secure the porous southwest border with Mexico.Its force of housewives, office workers and veterans sat in lawn chairs in southern Arizona, looking for people they suspected of being undocumented migrants and reporting them to the U.S. Border Patrol, until the group disbanded in 2010. That year, Simcox launched a brief, unsuccessful bid against incumbent U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona in the Republican primary.

18,POLITICS,Paul Ryan Proposes Clamping Down On 'Open Process',Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan_us_57582ec0e4b0ced23ca684b1,"It sounds like a wonky change, but he wants to restrict what proposals can be offered in the House.",2016-06-08,House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is proposing to alter the floor process for appropriations bills.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57585c231500002a00739860.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Paul Ryan said when he became Speaker in October he wanted to open up the legislative process to give lawmakers a chance to offer controversial proposals -- even if that meant some bills would fail on the House floor.Not eight months later, Ryan is changing his tune.During a closed-door meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, Ryan proposed altering the floor process for appropriations bills. Typically -- under former Speaker John Boehner, at least -- appropriations bills came to the floor under what is known as an open rule. That meant anyone could offer an amendment to the legislation and get a vote. (The Legislative Branch appropriations bill was an exception, as leaders wanted to ensure that members don't have to take controversial votes on pay raises or decreases for themselves.)But now Ryan wants to bring other spending measures to the floor under the same sort of ""structured rule"" as the Legislative Branch bill.""Unfortunately, last week it became clear that we can’t continue to do open rules on appropriations bills when the Democrats add poison pill amendments and then won’t vote for passage,"" a leadership aide told The Huffington Post, referring to a proposal which ensured that people who work for government contractors can’t be fired for being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.That amendment, which Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) authored, was added to an energy and water spending measure, causing Republicans to sink the bill on the floor.And with Democrats looking poised to do the same with other spending bills, GOP leadership thinks the process has to change -- and most Republicans agree.Republicans in the private meeting clapped when Ryan offered his proposal to end open rules.""It's hard to blame him for ratcheting down on our rights when our membership applauds when he does it,"" Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) told HuffPost. ""It felt almost surreal.""Massie was not one of those members clapping. He's against the move to structured rules, calling it ""a change in course back toward the old ways of controlling everything that happens on the floor."" Massie thinks it's less about protecting Republicans from Democratic amendments than it is about safeguarding moderates from conservative proposals.But Massie appears to be in the minority. ""A lot members want the old paternalistic system,"" he said. Even the conservative House Freedom Caucus looks like it could get onboard.HFC Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told HuffPost on Wednesday that conservatives were ""a little concerned"" about the shift, but they were balancing those concerns against the House being unable to pass any appropriations bills because of poison pills.""If conservative Republican amendments are made in order, that's the focus for us,"" Jordan said.Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), another conservative member of the Freedom Caucus, said he retained the right to vote against a rule if he disagreed with it. ""If the rules process is used as a mechanism to deprive members of the ability to propose amendments that are substantive and are related to the subject matter of the legislation, well that's one thing,"" he said.But Brooks doesn't see much of a distinction between appropriations bills and other pieces of legislation, which are almost always brought to the floor using a rule that makes some amendments in order and not others.Democrats, for their part, suggested this was less about preventing controversial amendments from their side more about protecting moderates from divisions within the Republican party.""I guess it didn't take too long for Speaker Ryan to change his tune about having an open process where democracy could flourish on the floor of the House,"" said Rep. Xavier Becerra (Calif.), chairman of the Democratic Caucus, Wednesday. ""My sense is this is a reaction to his own caucus, and his inability to get his members in the Republican conference to work as a team.""""So much for the people's House having an opportunity to debate openly bills and amendments on the floor,"" Becerra added.As for Massie, he said the first test whether this was just about stopping Democratic amendments would come this week, when the Rules Committee decides whether it will give floor time to an amendment of his that would defund the so-called post-speaker office.Massie and Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) have been leading the charge to defund the office, which grants former speakers a healthy budget for five years to wrap up some work.""If they allow a vote on that amendment,"" Massie said, ""I may have to eat my words."""

Elizabeth Warren, (D-Mass.) and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) have history. As majority leader, he plucked Warren from Harvard Law School to name her chair of a panel overseeing the Wall Street bailout. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57585f781500002f001b865d.jpeg?cache=dMLxepMdMT&ops=crop_16_32_4158_2444%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) believes Elizabeth Warren should be the running mate of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, according to four Senate sources familiar with Reid's thinking.Reid had initially been skeptical of the chatter around Warren, publicly warning that Democrats couldn't afford to lose the seat the Massachusetts senator currently occupies. But The Boston Globe reported last week that he tasked attorney Marc Elias with studying how manageable the loss would be. Elias is, not coincidentally, the general counsel for Clinton's campaign.As Reid has examined the issue in recent weeks, he has grown confident the Democrats could hold onto Warren's Senate seat and retake the upper chamber, according to sources. He also believes they could even put the House in play for Democrats, the sources said. The case for Warren is straightforward: She's an outspoken populist-progressive who could rally supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to Clinton's cause. Her grassroots fundraising prowess is legendary and could offset whatever loss of campaign revenue came from financial industry leaders souring on Clinton. And Warren's appeal goes far beyond the Sanders camp: A January 2015 focus group of independents and Republicans found that she and her message resonate strongly with working and middle class voters of all stripes. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) is among the lawmakers to have questioned whether the country would be ready to elect an all-woman ticket. Reporters asked Reid about Tester's open question on Tuesday -- and he said he thought the ticket would do just fine.One source close to Reid said that “he’s been back and forth on this” and is still concerned about the slim risk it puts Warren’s seat in. “Lately, he’s been leaning toward and sending signals for HRC to make the ask,” the source added.Reid and Warren have a history. As majority leader, he plucked Warren from Harvard Law School to name her chairman of a panel overseeing the Wall Street bailout. She used that visibility that came with that platform to push the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into law. Warren then was given the task of standing the institution up. Republicans and some bank-friendly Democrats blocked her from becoming the permanent head of the agency she created, but what they got instead was a powerful senator from Massachusetts, and now a leading contender for for vice president. The most important role of a vice president in a modern campaign has been to serve as an attack dog, and Warren has savaged Donald Trump on Twitter. Clinton seemed to be echoing one particularly effective line of Warren's -- calling Trump ""small"" -- in her victory speech Tuesday night. On the other hand, maybe not: Clinton gets terribly annoyed when people suggest she’s starting to sound a lot like Warren, sources close to the former Secretary of State say. As far as Clinton is concerned, she and Warren have always been fighting for the same things. However true that is, they may soon have the chance to do it as part of the same administration.A spokeswoman for Reid declined to comment."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).Clinton’s victory hands her a majority of the state’s 20 pledged delegates, helping solidify her status as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination on Monday night, when superdelegates declaring support for her pushed her total delegate count above the threshold needed to secure the nomination, according to The Associated Press.Sanders’ campaign called AP's report a “rush to judgment,” because superdelegates can change their mind until the July 25 vote at the party convention in Philadelphia. Sanders' campaign reiterated plans to try to get superdelegates, including those backing Clinton, to throw in their lot with Sanders as the candidate best suited to beat Donald Trump in the general election.The results in South Dakota will likely receive little attention on a night when five other states head to the polls, including California, where 475 delegates are in play -- more than any other state. Sanders trails Clinton in California by 4 percentage points, according to HuffPost Pollster’s polling average.Sparsely populated South Dakota is not a swing state, and has not voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in a general election in decades.No major polls appear to have been conducted in South Dakota prior to Tuesday’s primary. Sanders campaigned in the state in May. Former President Bill Clinton campaigned on his wife’s behalf later that month.The final contest in the Democratic primary comes June 14, when Democratic voters in the District of Columbia head to the polls."

Mike Honda (D-Calif.) and Democratic attorney Ro Khanna will once again compete to represent California's 17th Congressional District, setting up an intraparty battle in the heart of Silicon Valley. Under California's election rules, candidates from all party affiliations compete against one another in the primary race, with Tuesday's top two vote-getters advancing to November's general election. In a reprise of the district's 2014 race, Khanna and Honda came out on top Tuesday. Honda, who has represented the Silicon Valley district since 2002, narrowly held onto his seat in 2014 after a bitter contest with Khanna, a former official in President Barack Obama's administration.The intraparty House race was one of 2014's most contentious. Khanna billed himself as an energetic, tech-savvy alternative to Honda, angling to portray the longtime congressman as ineffective and corrupt. Honda, meanwhile, criticized Khanna as beholden to tech companies, and sought to paint himself as the right choice for Silicon Valley's working families. At a debate co-hosted by The Huffington Post in October 2014, the two sparred over Honda's use of his public office to raise funds for his congressional campaign, Khanna's allegiances to the business community and immigration reform.That race was one of 2014's most expensive, with approximately $7 million in spending.After his defeat, Khanna wasted little time before announcing he'd run again this year. The rematch has largely focused on an ethics report released last fall that said Honda and his staffers may have violated congressional rules by using government resources to benefit his re-election efforts. Honda set up a legal defense fund earlier this year, but so far hasn't spent any of the (very little) cash raised. Honda lacks support from one of his most important 2014 backers: Obama. While the president backed Honda early in the 2014 race, he's staying out this time around. Honda, first elected to Congress in 2000, is pitching voters on his progressive record and touting endorsements from his congressional colleagues. He also seeks to counter the nativist rhetoric of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump with accounts of the time he spent in a Japanese internment camp, and vocally supports his transgender granddaughter. Khanna, meanwhile, is attempting to broaden his appeal beyond tech, despite winning support from Silicon Valley bigwigs, including Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and venture capitalist Sean Parker. The San Francisco Chronicle reports:Khanna learned that the hard way two years ago when he ran as the candidate from Silicon Valley, not recognizing that there are plenty of voters in that district who aren’t hooked into the tech world.“With individuals ready to trample on the middle class bank rolling my opponent’s campaign, we know that this is going to be one of the closest Congressional Races in the country,"" Honda said in a statement Tuesday night. ""I am ready to fight tooth and nail between now and November 8th so I can continue delivering for middle class families and turning progressive ideals into results.""""The voters sent a clear message to status quo politicians who are more interested in looking out for themselves and their donors than the people they were elected to represent. Their time is done,"" said Khanna. ""Tonight represents a victory for those who want leadership that offers a new way, not the same old way.""Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated Khanna's role in the Obama administration.

Leslie Rasmussen, of the Ohio band Good English, defended her childhood friend Turner, 20, and blamed political correctness and underage drinking for his arrest and conviction after two grad students caught him sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster on Stanford's campus in 2015. ""I don’t think it’s fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn’t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him,"" Rasmussen wrote in a letter, obtained by The Cut, to Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky. ""I am not blaming her directly for this, because that isn’t right. But where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campuses isn’t always because people are rapists.""Soon after Rasmussen's letter became public, the Northside Festival announced Good English would not perform as scheduled. Other venues also have canceled concert dates the band had lined up in Brooklyn for this week, according to Pitchfork and Gothamist. Outrage swelled after Persky sentenced Turner to six months in county jail last week for his three felony convictions, despite state guidelines recommending a minimum of two years in state prison. Turner faced a maximum 14-year sentence after being found guilty of assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated woman; sexually penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object; and sexually penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object.The backlash has been strongest against the judge, and an online petition seeking his removal from the bench has garnered nearly half a million signatures. Rasmussen finds herself in the same boat as Turner's father, who was roundly criticized for his letter to the judge claiming his son had already been punished enough for ""20 minutes of action.""Rasmussen defended her letter in a post on Good English's Facebook account. ""I understand that this appeal has now provided an opportunity for people to misconstrue my ideas into a distortion that suggests I sympathize with sex offenses and those who commit them or that I blame the victim involved. Nothing could be farther from the truth, and I apologize for anything my statement has done to suggest that I don’t feel enormous sympathy for the victim and her suffering,"" Rasmussen wrote. Rasmussen and Good English have not responded to The Huffington Post's requests for comment. "

Their phones keep ringing, and it's either a member of the press on the line or a critic leaving a nasty voicemail. This all started when presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested that Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge overseeing two cases against Trump University, was biased because of his Mexican-American heritage.Trump incorrectly identified the Indiana-born Curiel as ""Mexican"" and repeatedly pointed out that he was a member of the San Diego chapter of the La Raza Lawyers Association.""He’s a Mexican,"" Trump told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Friday. ""We’re building a wall between here and Mexico. ... This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now I say, why? Well, I want to -- I'm building a wall, OK? And it's a wall between Mexico, not another country.""""He's member of a club or society very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine,"" Trump said in another interview on Sunday. ""But I say he’s got bias.""Not only is Trump wrong about Curiel's national origin, but he's also wrong about the legal group, San Diego chapter president Osuna told The Huffington Post.""A lot of people are assuming that since it's called ‘La Raza lawyers' that it’s only Mexicans,"" Osuna said in an interview. ""But we consist of 300 members: judges, lawyers, law students, non-legal professionals that work in the legal field.""The San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association was formed in 1976 to advance equality and empower Latino attorneys and the community in San Diego County, providing bar exam stipends, scholarships for law students, social networking events for Latino lawyers, mentoring programs and professional development seminars. The group also hosts candidate debates for local elections. Its members are ""Latino, non-Latino, Mexican, non-Mexican, Caucasian,"" Osuna said. Yet conservative media outlets have continued to spread misinformation, linking the local lawyers association to the National Council of La Raza, or NCLR -- a 50-year-old nonprofit civil rights group that advocates for the Latino community nationwide. The two groups are not related, though their names both include the phrase ""la raza,"" which means ""the people"" in Spanish, but can also be literally translated as ""the race."" But both Trump and conservative pundits have chosen to use the literal translation to cast the group as some sort of Mexican supremacist organization.In a blog posted over the weekend, NCLR called on Trump to apologize to Curiel, and also clarified that it is not associated with the lawyers group. ""There are in fact hundreds if not thousands of organizations, media outlets, and associations that use “La Raza,” the post said. ""There is nothing nefarious about the use of this term.""Yet Fox News pundit Sean Hannity argued in a post that Trump was right to be wary of Curiel’s membership with the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association. “The San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association to which Curiel belongs is none-the-less a Latino activist group that supports pro-illegal immigration organizations,” he wrote.Hannity reasons that the lawyers association must be tied to NCLR because the group's website includes a link to NCLR's site, as a recent article in conservative The Daily Caller noted. The San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association site does indeed include a link to NCLR's website on its “For the Community” page, which lists contact information for healthcare assistance, immigration detention facilities, and other community resources and institutions.Osuna said he is aware that critics have seized on this hyperlink to the NCLR website as a reason to question Curiel’s objectivity. But NCLR is a “completely different” organization, he emphasizes. “We are not associated with them; we are not an affiliate of them.""""The San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association is a diversity bar association and we focus on increasing diversity and equality, particularly with Latinos in the legal field,"" Osuna said.Still, regardless of which organization they think they're attacking, plenty of online commenters have lashed out at Osuna's group.The barrage of emails and calls from Trump supporters haven't made life easy for members of Osuna's association. In an official 3-page statement on Wednesday, the group said the attacks have made it necessary to explain what it does. ""The comments made by Trump have been misleading, blatant lies and even racist in nature,"" the statement reads.Issuing a statement appeared to be the only way to respond to the constant stream of “vitriolic” and “hateful” voicemails, emails and social media posts, Osuna said.“What’s troubling about Trump’s remarks is that he is a presidential nominee for one of the two major parties, and is calling into question the integrity of the court and offering us Americans an ominous view of how he’d wield the power of the presidency in order to intimidate the judicial branch,"" said Osuna. ""It’s a blatant disregard of the separation of powers.""Osuna described Curiel, who is a member of the bar association, as someone who has “dedicated his life to public service."" He pointed to one of Curiel’s many cases in which he prosecuted an international drug cartel that put a hit out on him. Over the past 24 hours, a number of Republicans have assailed Trump for his comments about the judge, calling them ""unacceptable."" House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Trump’s statements were the ""textbook definition of a racist comment,"" and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) advised the nominee to stop “attacking” minority groups. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), who is facing a tough re-election fight, became the first Trump supporter to rescind his endorsement.After defending himself over the weekend, Trump issued a non-apology on Tuesday evening, saying his statements were ""misconstrued"" and that he employs ""thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent."" He added, however, that he still feels ""justified"" in questioning whether he’s receiving ""fair treatment"" from Curiel.Trump also kept the narrative surrounding the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association going, vaguely referencing Curiel's ""reported associations with certain professional organizations."" “What is ironic is that there are a lot of people that are leaving messages that are hateful, and they ask why such an organization is necessary,” Osuna said. “Just the notion that they are leaving those kind of remarks and voicemails is emblematic of why such an organization is necessary. It’s no secret that minority communities have been underrepresented and underserved.”"

Representatives from leading Latino rights groups and Hispanic legal organizations told reporters on a conference call that they are skeptical Trump will disavow his racist statements about Curiel. Trump has argued that the judge cannot fairly preside over a class-action lawsuit against Trump University because his parents were born in Mexico.But an apology is necessary if Trump wants to lessen the potential damage his comments could have on both the Latino community and the Republican Party, the group said. ""Trump needs to publicly apologize to Judge Curiel, to the Hispanic community and to all of the judges who honorably serve this nation,” said Robert Maldonado, the head of the National Hispanic Bar Association.Trump addressed the controversy in a statement released Tuesday, but declined to walk back his remarks. Instead, he mentioned having Mexican friends and repeated his accusation that Curiel would be biased against Trump because of his “reported associations with certain professional organizations.” The statement did not name the organizations in question. “It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage,” the statement said. “I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent.”Trump went on Fox News later on Tuesday and said critics should ""get over it."" Janet Murguía, national president and CEO of the advocacy group National Council of La Raza, said Trump’s comments about Curiel were impossible to misunderstand and “remarkably consistent” with statements he has made since launching his campaign one year ago. “It is repugnant, un-American and a slap in the face to our increasingly diverse judiciary and to all of us who participate in this democracy,” Murguía said of Trump’s comments. “The Latino community has not misconstrued Trump’s remarks.”Trump's lawyers have not filed a motion in court to get the case reassigned to a different judge. If they were to try, the judge’s national heritage would not be sufficient grounds to do so. Trump, who has made insulting and at times racist commentary a central feature of his campaign, has faced a barrage of criticism over the remarks, including from top leaders in the Republican Party.For example, Latino leaders on the conference call repeatedly referenced House Speaker Paul Ryan's characterization of Trump's attack on Curiel as the ""textbook definition of a racist comment.” Racism notwithstanding, Ryan continues to support Trump for president. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

""Trump needs to publicly apologize to Judge Curiel, to the Hispanic community and to all of the judges who honorably serve this nation,” said Robert Maldonado, the head of the National Hispanic Bar Association.Trump addressed the controversy in a statement released Tuesday, but declined to walk back his remarks. Instead, he mentioned having Mexican friends and repeated his accusation that Curiel would be biased against Trump because of his “reported associations with certain professional organizations.” The statement did not name the organizations in question. “It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage,” the statement said. “I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent.”Trump went on Fox News later on Tuesday and said critics should ""get over it."" Janet Murguía, national president and CEO of the advocacy group National Council of La Raza, said Trump’s comments about Curiel were impossible to misunderstand and “remarkably consistent” with statements he has made since launching his campaign one year ago. “It is repugnant, un-American and a slap in the face to our increasingly diverse judiciary and to all of us who participate in this democracy,” Murguía said of Trump’s comments. “The Latino community has not misconstrued Trump’s remarks.”Trump's lawyers have not filed a motion in court to get the case reassigned to a different judge. If they were to try, the judge’s national heritage would not be sufficient grounds to do so. Trump, who has made insulting and at times racist commentary a central feature of his campaign, has faced a barrage of criticism over the remarks, including from top leaders in the Republican Party.For example, Latino leaders on the conference call repeatedly referenced House Speaker Paul Ryan's characterization of Trump's attack on Curiel as the ""textbook definition of a racist comment.” Racism notwithstanding, Ryan continues to support Trump for president. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

28,POLITICS,Iowa’s Biggest Newspaper Calls Chuck Grassley Spineless For Refusing To Stand Up To Trump,Jacquie Lee and Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chuck-grassley-supreme-court-nomination-trump_us_57586d11e4b0e39a28ac4de0,The Des Moines Register issued the scathing editorial as the senator seeks re-election.,2016-06-08,Sen.

""As Edmund Burke said, the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,"" The Des Moines Register wrote in the editorial. ""And when it comes to Donald Trump, there are invertebrates that have shown more spine than Sen. Chuck Grassley.""Grassley has not formally endorsed the presumptive GOP nominee, but the Republican senator appeared at a Trump event in January and said the country had ""an opportunity once again to make America great again."" More recently, Grassley has treated Trump with kid gloves over his racist comments about U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel over his handling of a lawsuit against Trump University.Republicans and Democrats condemned the businessman for accusing the Indiana-born judge of being biased against him because of his Mexican heritage. But Grassley simply said, ""I would not say what Trump said."" He also pointed to Trump's love for filing lawsuits as evidence that he ""must respect the judiciary.""The Des Moines Register said Grassley's weak comments called into question how effective he would be as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee under a Trump administration.""Just how diligent would our senator be in reviewing the nominees chosen by a man who has categorized Mexican immigrants as rapists and who initially refused to disavow support from white supremacists?"" the editors asked.The editorial also hit Grassley for his current work as committee chair, as about 10 percent of U.S. district court judgeships sit vacant. '[I]t is surprising to see the office of Sen. Charles Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dismiss these vacancies as a 'manufactured crisis' undeserving of public attention,"" the editors wrote. ""Regardless of who is to blame for the vacancies, the senator should at least recognize the value in having those critical positions filled.""Grassley has also refused to give President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a hearing in his committee. He argues that the next president should be able to choose the late Justice Antonin Scalia's replacement (hoping, of course, that a Republican wins in November).Democrats are eyeing Grassley's seat in the 2016 election, which is why the Des Moines Register editorial could be so damaging. He'll face off against former Iowa Lt. Gov. Patty Judge (D) and has acknowledged this year's campaign could be his toughest yet. Grassley's office did not return a request for comment."

The English musician, who happens to be BFFs with Taylor Swift, is reportedly being sued for $20 million dollars over his song ""Photograph,"" according to Billboard. Songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard and their publishing company claim the song borrows heavily from their track, ""Amazing,"" which was released as a single by 2010 ""X Factor"" winner Matt Cardle. Harrington and Leonard have written hits for some of the industry's biggest stars, including Kylie Minogue. To help with their case, the plaintiffs are working with attorney Richard Busch, who was involved in the copyright lawsuit between Marvin Gaye's family and Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams over the song ""Blurred Lines."" If you recall, Thicke and Williams lost the case and contested a $7.4 million jury verdict that found they plagiarized the Motown great's “Got to Give It Up."" The lawsuit against Sheeran says ""Photograph"" is too similar to the original composition of ""Amazing"" by Harrington and Leonard and the version recorded by Cardle. The plaintiffs claim the two songs share 39 identical notes. Billboard obtained a copy of the complaint, which states, ""The songs' similarities reach the very essence of the work. The similarities go beyond substantial, which is itself sufficient to establish copyright infringement, and are in fact striking. The similarity of words, vocal style, vocal melody, melody, and rhythm are clear indicators, among other things, that 'Photograph' copies 'Amazing.'""Sheeran has yet to respond to the accusations. The Huffington Post has reached out to his rep and will update this post accordingly. According to Billboard, the profits made by Sheeran are estimated to be over $20 million. The plaintiffs are also reportedly seeking statutory damages and an injunction or royalty agreement."
30,POLITICS,This Retired Coal Miner Has Black Lung Disease. He's Fighting To Make Sure No One Else Gets It.,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/miner-black-lung-disease_us_5751bf08e4b0ed593f143fd9,"Michael ""Flip"" Wilson stopped working as a miner more than a year ago. Then the hard work began.",2016-06-08,Retired coal miner Flip Wilson suffers from black lung disease but still patrols his old mine.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5755c7a3130000a109383b8d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mike ""Flip"" Wilson worked his last day in a Kentucky coal mine last spring. He had decided to retire and spend more time with his wife. After 40 years toiling below ground, and now suffering from black lung disease, Wilson had just reached a settlement with his employer, Armstrong Coal, over a series of discrimination complaints stemming from his safety activism in the mine. But just a few days after his settlement, a restless Wilson drove the 45 minutes back to his old workplace, the Parkway Mine. Wilson had been designated a miners' representative when he worked there. A miners' rep accompanies federal officials when they inspect the mine's safety, pointing out hazards that need to be fixed. A diligent miners' rep can get his own mine fined and even shut down, all in the name of protecting his colleagues from disaster. Many coal companies shun miners' reps.Even though he was no longer employed, Wilson knew he still had the right to be a miners' rep -- and he decided to exercise that right. In a highly unusual move, the 62-year-old demanded to view the safety log books and to know when federal inspectors would be doing their next walk-through. He wanted to join them. He was no longer paid to work at the mine, but he wanted to help make sure it was safe.Mine management, apparently baffled by Wilson's presence, told him he wasn't supposed to be there anymore. A company lawyer called and emailed Wilson's lawyer, Tony Oppegard, to find out why his client was still hanging around the mine. The lawyer noted that Wilson was no longer an employee.But he's a miners' rep, Oppegard responded.Congress created the concept of the miners' representative in 1977, when it passed a landmark mine safety law following the Scotia mine disasters that killed 26 men in Kentucky. The idea was simple: empower miners by giving them a role in the enforcement of the law. After all, no one knows a mine better than a miner who works there. It takes only two miners to designate someone a miners' rep through the Mine Safety and Health Administration. And yet very few miners actually take on the duty.""A lot of shit goes with it,"" said Brandon Shemwell, a worker at Parkway who serves as a miners' rep alongside Wilson. ""You've got company sucks that don't like it. They think you're trying to get on top of the company and shut 'em down. It ain't about that at all. It's about having a good, safe work environment.""MSHA doesn't have easily accessible data on the number of active miners' reps in the country's mines. Amy Louviere, an agency spokeswoman, said MSHA has ramped up its efforts to educate miners about the law, and that its inspectors regularly inform miners of their right to participate in inspections. But Celeste Monforton, a workplace safety expert and former MSHA employee who's investigated mining disasters, said only a ""very small fraction"" of non-union mines have representatives who walk with inspectors. Shemwell said he worked at four mines prior to Parkway, none of which had miners' reps, as far as he knows. ""It's been my experience that many miners don't even know about that right,"" Monforton said. ""It's such a unique protection. It's really unfortunate that more miners don't understand what it is and how they can really take advantage of it."" Miners' reps may be rare, but a former miner who still takes the time to walk with inspectors pro bono, as Wilson does, is virtually unheard of. With unions no longer a presence in Kentucky coal country -- the last union mine there shut down last year -- Wilson is demonstrating how miners can wield the law themselves to make their mines safer, so long as they're willing to confront the company. Shemwell said their decision to assert their rights as miners' reps has transformed the safety at Parkway, especially when ""there's always the fear of Flip coming in.""""Flip is utterly unique. He is also fearless,"" said Oppegard, who's representing Wilson alongside Wes Addington of the Appalachian Citizens' Law Center. ""He doesn't get anything out of traveling with federal mine inspectors other than the satisfaction of knowing that he's helping to protect the health and safety of his friends and former co-workers.""Wilson has been driving the 70 miles round trip to and from Parkway up to four times a week since he stopped working at the mine. He often waits for federal inspectors to arrive so he can accompany them on their rounds. Motivated by his own experience with black lung, Wilson continues to point out dangers, which often results in fines for his former employer. Armstrong Coal did not respond to interview requests for this story.""He's just trying to make it better for the miners,"" Shemwell said of Wilson. ""He found out the seriousness of the dust and what it will do to you. He really cares.""Wilson wasn't always such a gadfly. As a Kentucky native with an eighth grade education, he was the first man in his family to work in a coal mine. He was simply grateful to have a good-paying, blue-collar job in a region where they were lacking. With three stepsons, a daughter and a wife to support, he knew better than to question an order underground. For most of his four-decade career, Wilson wasn't even aware of mine safety laws, let alone helping to enforce them. Wherever he worked, he tended to skirt safety precautions for the sake of production, just like many of his co-workers and supervisors did. He obeyed the unspoken rule of every mine he worked in: The coal must flow, or you must go.But over time, he came to know many workers who were hurt or killed on the job. And eventually, he had a hard time breathing. He had a chest x-ray done and found out he'd developed black lung disease due to years of exposure to high levels of coal dust.Miners develop black lung, or coal worker's pneumoconiosis, from breathing too much coal dust in the mine. The lung disease can lead to painful fits of coughing, difficulty breathing, chronic bronchitis and death. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that more than 76,000 Americans have died as a result of black lung since 1968.Wilson said the mine atmosphere had often been so dusty that he couldn't see but a few feet in front of him. Angry and emboldened, he began to refuse work he believed was unsafe.""The last two years I worked, it was slowly coming to me,"" Wilson explained. ""'Hey, I don't have to do this.'""As an elder statesman inside the mine, and with little time left on the job, Wilson felt he had an obligation to speak out for the sake of others who may fear being fired -- even if it meant alienating some of those same people. Facing a retirement filled with hacking and wheezing, he wanted to make sure the miners behind him didn't face the same fate.""I've seen enough people hurt in the mines in my time, especially the young boys. Matter of fact, I've packed some of 'em out,"" Wilson said. ""I just want to make sure that the mine is running safe and that they're doing what they're supposed to be doing. I'm thinking about the men and the safety of everybody up there. I don't wanna see nobody hurt, but I know how the company is operating.""In 2014, The Huffington Post published a report in which workers alleged that Armstrong Coal submitted misleadingly low coal dust readings to federal officials. Under the law, mine operators must keep the coal dust in the mine atmosphere at a reasonable level, to guard against black lung and the possibility of a mine explosion. Before the system was recently overhauled, miners would wear dust pumps to capture coal dust samples, then the company would submit those samples to the feds for testing. Workers at the Parkway Mine said they were encouraged to cover their dust pumps or take them off altogether to keep the readings low and avoid scrutiny from regulators.Such alleged cheating is hardly unheard of in Appalachian mines. What's extremely rare is for miners to publicly accuse their employer of fraud. Wilson was one of two then-current miners at Parkway who went on the record with the allegation. ""There's been cheating ever since I've been there,"" Wilson said at the time. After he learned he had black lung disease, Wilson applied with the federal government for what's known as part 90 status. The status allows miners with black lung to work in a less dusty area of the mine, often outside, for the same rate of pay they would earn underground. Just as they don't care for miners' reps, many coal companies don't care for part 90 miners, since they can't work them as they see fit. Safety advocates say miners are often discouraged from seeking part 90 status -- even though black lung is ravaging pockets of Appalachia and many miners would no doubt qualify for it. According to Labor Department filings, Wilson claimed a manager at his mine urged him not to apply for it. (That allegation was part of Wilson's case that was later settled.) After he secured his status in 2014, Wilson was the only part 90 miner in all of Western Kentucky, according to his lawyers. MSHA says there is not a single part 90 miner in the region right now.""The coal companies don't care if you get black lung or not,"" Wilson said. ""They don't care as long as they get the coal. That's all there is to it.""His newfound activism and part 90 status apparently didn't endear him to his fellow miners. According to Wilson, somebody wrote, ""Die, rat,"" on his locker. His locker door and the lock itself were glued repeatedly, leading him to replace what he guesses was seven locks. He said the comments were endless. ""There's Flip, he's trying to shut us down."" ""All he ever did was get a job outside."" ""You're taking money out of my pocket."" ""You don't need to be here. Why don't you go home."" Many miners, he said, would no longer look him in the eye.Once Wilson continued to show up at the mine after he retired, he said mine management tried to keep him off the property. Oppegard said he notified the company that Wilson had the right not only to accompany inspectors but also to view the company's log books, which detail any accidents that may have happened. Wilson said the company began allowing him to drive onto the property, but wouldn't do him the courtesy of informing him when inspectors arrived. So Wilson would drive to the mine and wait outside. ""I get there sometimes before the federal inspectors get there,"" Wilson said. ""I'll go through the books, look at the maps, and check everything to make sure they have it in order. I'll examine the pre-shift and on-shift [logs] for dangerous conditions, look at the electrical books. When the feds show up, I tell 'em I'd like to ride with 'em."" Wilson said each of his tours with inspectors typically leads to two or three safety violations for Armstrong. Records with the Mine Safety and Health Administration indicate the company has racked up more than 400 citations at Parkway since June 2015.In February, the Parkway mine resorted to what's known as a corrective action program to deal with its many safety infractions. The mine was headed toward becoming a ""pattern of violations"" mine, a designation reserved for mines with the worst safety records. POV mines face tougher scrutiny and are easier for MSHA to shut down. If Parkway falls on the POV list, it could be hard for the company to get off it.On a number of occasions, Wilson has called MSHA's hotline when he feels MSHA's own inspectors haven't adequately cracked down on the company. Before regulators cite a company for hazards, they typically meet with mine management to haggle over the citation. Wilson prefers to sit in on these meetings to keep the heat on both parties. He gets the feeling that his vigilance annoys the regulators almost as much as the company. ""They don't want me pointing things out, but it's my place to,"" Wilson said. ""It's my job. If I see anything that I think might get somebody hurt, I point it out.""Asked to respond to Wilson's claim that inspectors go too easy on Armstrong, MSHA's Louviere said the Parkway mine is the only mine in Western Kentucky that has a corrective action program in place. That plan requires that the mine manager meet with MSHA every two weeks. Louviere also noted the hundreds of violations MSHA has racked up over the past year.Wilson's legal battles continue even in retirement. He currently has at least five discrimination complaints filed against Armstrong, accusing the company of illegally interfering with his rights as a miners' rep. Wilson lodged most of those complaints through his own lawyers, but the Labor Department has taken up his cause as well. Earlier this month, the labor secretary filed a complaint against Armstrong accusing the company of illegally excluding Wilson and Shemwell from part of a post-inspection conference between inspectors and company officials. Wilson's original plan for retirement was merely to look after his wife, who's been sick. But his own health problems have motivated him to stay on as a Parkway miners' rep, even though it's becoming more and more difficult for him to breathe, ""like you ain't got no air at times,"" he said. He relies on inhalers but they only help so much. He can no longer push a lawn mower or dig a hole in the yard the way he once could. Walking long distances or exercising is out of the question. He wakes up in the middle of the night coughing.No miner, he said, should have to give up his lungs to provide for his family.""[Mining] made me a good living. But I made sacrifices, too, and I'm paying for it now,"" Wilson said. ""I'm doing this not just for me but for all the other people who worked up there and breathed all that dust."""
