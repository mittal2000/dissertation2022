0,FIFTY,Why We Should Care About Changes In The Pharmaceutical Industry,"Michael Hodin, ContributorCEO, Global Coalition on Aging",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pharmaceutical-industry_b_5280014.html,The pharmaceutical sector is still struggling to find an operating model that will work in the 21st century. The shocking news of GlaxoSmithKline's sale of its cancer-drug business to Novartis -- and the many recent huge deals like it -- are the most recent evidence.,2014-05-13,"Grandma is getting older, and this is just at bedtime.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb66a0526000035008308f0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The pharmaceutical sector is still struggling to find an operating model that will work in the 21st century. The shocking news of GlaxoSmithKline's sale of its cancer-drug business to Novartis -- and the many recent huge deals like it -- are the most recent evidence. And no doubt it is pharma's profound state of change -- not unlike others like music, television, energy, publishing -- which are part of their struggle to break out and start delivering the kinds of shareholder returns that everyone grew accustomed to in the last two decades of the 20th century. But that was then. And this... well, it's a new kind of now. The industry used to be defined by great innovative discoveries that led physicians globally to write billions of value in scripts. Now, a set of external influences weighing in heavily -- at least as much impact as the traditional drivers of success -- R&D and Marketing.   Most incredibly, there is the degree to which the industry has become politicized. It was in 2000 when then-Presidential candidate Al Gore created the nefarious trifecta of Big Tobacco, Big Oil, and Big Pharma. This three-headed scapegoat became a core talking point that would help propel him to win the popular vote. The regulatory environment in the U.S. has also become increasingly burdensome as is that across the globe from Europe to Japan, the other two sources of pharmaceutical company revenue outside the U.S.But, most of all, and not unrelated to the first two, companies pricing models have come under crippling pressure. On one level, the aging of the population is driving up demand for health products and services. On another level, both public and private insurance plans are increasingly unable (and often unwilling) to pay for innovative medicines - medicines that were created through the ""magic"" of the sector's R&D. And both of these marketplace dynamics are exacerbated by the ""information explosion"" -- in which more and more people have come to demand they get the medicines. But then they want it on the cheap -- often too cheap to continue to fund the innovation of the last century. All of this prompts the question: Will these Pharma mega-deals just rearrange cubicles? Or will they prompt companies to implement the structural changes needed to operate -- and thrive -- in our 21st century healthcare marketplace? Time will tell. In the meantime, jittery leaders in pharma c-suites may want to bring 21st century realities into their strategic planning. 1. Demography versus Geography: From a global point of view, the aging process makes us more alike than different. Healthcare growth in the years ahead isn't regional -- it's not Europe or China or the U.S. It's demographic: it's keeping the billion-plus over-50 segment healthy and active. A demographic lens also shows where to invest. The obvious choices are Alzheimer's, mental health, cardiovascular disease, and other non-communicable diseases that we get in fantastic amounts as we age. But there's more to it than that. Healthy, active, productive aging in the 21st century will demand that we learn to overcome theh 20th century conditions of aging - deteriorating skin, loss of vision, hearing, and muscle mass. Solving these conditions will create markets worth trillions in the decades ahead. And in the process add value to humanity about which Non-Profit world could only dream. But this is not just a health issue, or a question of corporate profits. Most fundamentally, this is a question of economic growth and national economic competitiveness. Dollars that go to healthy aging are not a cost, but an investment. The decision-makers -- those who decide how to deploy resources to align the medicines with willingness to pay -- need to get this memo. Back in the eighties and nineties, the sector relied on physicians and aligned its resources accordingly. In the 21st century, there are new sets of ""stakeholders,"" like caregivers, payers, nurses, and communication outlets all with impact on the decisions and choices around pricing, prescribing and paying. Interesting that while there's a lot of internal industry movement, one hasn't seen much of buying outside the box -- a home care company, a communications company, an economics unit -- that might be more closely aligned to succeeding in the new environment. 2. Data versus Development: Drug development seems hopelessly stuck in an old paradigm as one barely sees evidence of applying big data, search engine analytics, and global, instantaneous information capabilities to development, including the cumbersome and what should be 20th century clinical trial process. But to really understand these applications, including the truly profound regulatory changes that will have to be brought along, pharmaceutical companies would want not to acquire one another, but instead look to Silicon Valley. A partnership with Google could lead to a GPS for clinical trial development. 3. External versus Internal: The most forward-thinking in the pharmaceutical sector have made the leap to bring the development phase of their innovative medicines into the commercial side, in some cases just after ""proof of concept."" This is a good move, as it allows an early, expedited internal decision-process on whether the medicine is likely to make it in the marketplace. In years past, pharmaceutical companies could afford to spend billions on a promising candidate without knowing about its commercial likelihood. No longer. Even among the most progressive companies, there is still a timeworn approach about what constitutes the commercial side. The basic components of change -- population aging, politicization, greater degrees of regulation, consumerization through information and therefore new stakeholders -- hint at what constitutes the characteristics of our 21st century marketplace. These components demand a different set of skills, knowledge, capabilities, and experiences for the pharmaceutical company which will win in the 21st. So let the industry keep merging and acquiring until it's heart is content. But if the 20th strategies remain, these companies will never recapture the growth of its dream days. More importantly, they will be less capable of innovating for tomorrow's marketplace. If that's the case, we all lose.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

The MVP trophy is at right. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb756511f0000390124ffee.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, with the basketball world watching, Kevin Durant delivered a beautiful, gratitude-filled MVP speech dedicated to his mother, with kind words also for his Oklahoma City Thunder teammates and coaches. The 25-year-old superstar had been nipping at the heels of two-time reigning NBA MVP LeBron James, and finally broke thorough, receiving 119 first-place votes. LeBron, meanwhile, finished second with just six first-place votes. Durant, who averaged 32 points, 7.4 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game, is the first player to win both the scoring title and the MVP award in the same season since Allen Iverson during the 2000-01 season. But it wasn't Durant's stats that were winning him new admirers last week; it was the way he modestly and genuinely paid tribute the people in his life who made a difference in his journey to the top. Here are 5 truths about success that Durant touched on in his memorable speech.Nobody Succeeds AloneDurant and his brother were raised by a single mother, Wanda Pratt, in a Washington, D.C., suburb. She worked as a Postal Service mail handler and wanted desperately for her sons to one day have a better life, free of hardship.""You sacrificed for us. You're the real MVP,"" Durant said to her. ""Single parent with two boys by the time you were 21 years old. Everybody told us we weren't supposed to be here. We moved from apartment to apartment by ourselves. One of the best memories I had was when we moved into our first apartment. No bed, no furniture, and we just all sat in a room and just hugged each other. We thought we'd made it.""Success Often Grows Out Of Frustration And FailureEarly on his high school career, Durant grew extremely frustrated with the lack of attention garnered by college coaches and recruiters. At one point, he was seriously debating quitting basketball all together and even considering street life, but said his mother saved him.""You kept us off the street,"" he said. ""You put clothes on our backs. You put food on the table. When you didn't eat, you made sure we ate and [you] went to sleep hungry.""Individual Success Is Built On TeamworkDurant expressed gratitude to his Thunder teammates and coaches as well. Perhaps most importantly, he made it a point to mention the talented, but also embattled point guard, Russell Westbrook.""You got a big piece of this,"" he said. ""You're an MVP-caliber player. It's a blessing to play with you.""Savoring Success Means Not Always Looking Ahead To The Next Big ThingDurant will become a free agent in 2016, and despite last week's ""Mr. Unreliable"" headline in the local paper, he seems content to remain in Oklahoma City. ""This is the perfect place for me,"" he said. In other words, Thunder fans can breathe a sigh of relief.'Touching'Four-time NBA champion and former MVP Shaquille O'Neal couldn't help but be moved by Durant's speech.""It was very touching,"" O'Neal told The Huffington Post. ""Most young African-Americans -- we have similar stories ... it was a speech that will always be remembered.""Healthy Competition Can Aid SuccessOver the past three seasons, the league's MVP award has essentially morphed into a two-man race: Durant and LeBron. In fact, the two have even trained together during the offseason, in addition playing together on Team USA.In his speech, Durant paid his rival perhaps the ultimate compliment: ""[James] definitely drives me and pushes me to reach [a higher] level as a player.""Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @Schultz_Report and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report.

2,QUEER VOICES,How a Conservative Catholic Girl Became a Producer on a Gay Web Series,"Kit Williamson, ContributorActor, Filmmaker, Activist, Creator of ""EastSiders: The Series""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-a-conservative-cathol_b_5283307.html,"I'm still a radical, political queer and Kristyne is still a conservative, Catholic girl, and I am so happy that we were able to work together, despite our differences, to produce EastSiders.",2014-05-13,2014-05-07-729449_10101300472933713_950063816_o.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-07-729449_10101300472933713_950063816_o-thumb.jpg,"When I started working with Kristyne Fetsic I had no idea that she was a conservative Catholic, or that she had complicated feelings about LGBT people. She was just a friend from another set I had worked on that I knew was passionate about telling stories and wanted to get into producing. So I offered her a job on my gay web series, EastSiders, a dark comedy about a gay couple trying to stay together in the aftermath of infidelity in Silver Lake, CA. We shot the show independently and put it on Youtube, and at the time we had no idea it would go on to get picked up by Logo, win awards and attract the following that it has. We were just two broke filmmakers setting up lights in my living room. As we got to know each other better and have deeper conversations (usually over drinks after a long day of shooting), I came to understand just how different we were. Part of me was horrified to discover a conservative in our midst, having moved away from Mississippi at 16 to escape the overwhelming conservatism and anti-LGBT sentiment I was immersed in growing up. She even confessed that she had voted Republican in the past. Thankfully, Kristyne and I both saw working together on the series as an opportunity to find common ground. This week, Kristyne wrote a blog post for ""Ms. in the Biz"" about her journey and, with her permission, I would like to share her experience with the Gay Voices community. The radical, political queer in me has learned a great deal about accepting other people's beliefs from her. I'm still a radical, political queer and Kristyne is still a conservative, Catholic girl, and I am so happy that we were able to work together, despite our differences, to produce EastSiders. This Summer, we are coming back together to produce a second season of the show.Below, I've included a shortened version of her post. I admire Kristyne's openness, both in relaying her experience and in being open to understanding the experiences of others. I hope everyone will read this with an open mind and see just how much we all have to learn from one another. I write this blog with some hesitation because it feels as if I am straddling some sort of battle line and I risk upsetting my comrades on both sides. That being said, let me tell you my story.Despite her hesitation, Kristyne took a leap and joined the team. Unbeknownst to me, she was working through a lot of issues while maintaining her professionalism and enthusiasm about the project. And then she had a breakthrough.Once EastSiders production started, I was surprised to be shaken that out of all my worries. All at once I was finally able to form some sort of opinion on the whole matter. During an average, ordinary shoot day, I had an epiphany. I had recently gone through a breakup when production of the show began and it all of a sudden struck me how strongly I related to the story of the show. I specifically remember shooting the conversation between Cal and Kathy in the first episode and thinking ""I know exactly how Cal feels."" It was through the story of EastSiders that I found how I felt about the LGBT community. If God is love, and if a person is compelled and inspired to love another person (no matter what genders are involved) then that's God working in this world and that is a beautiful thing.Kristyne's journey has affirmed my belief in the power of storytelling to change hearts and minds. I think it's so important that we embrace LGBT filmmakers, writers and artists because it's through telling these stories (and sometimes, working together to tell these stories) that we relate to each other as human beings. I'm still not 100 percent honest with everyone I know about my involvement with the Catholic Church and EastSiders. I don't discuss it with my family, because I know they don't really want to acknowledge my involvement. I know my Catholic/Christian friends would frown at me and think I'm living a life of sin. And I know my more liberal friends would tease me for believing in archaic teachings and practices. I mean in all honestly, you can call me a ""pick and choose"" Catholic. There are many teachings I believe in and there are many teachings that I don't based on my experiences and my will to love everyone.To read the full blog, visit ""Ms. in the Biz."""
3,BLACK VOICES,Does Lupita Nyong'o's Rise Signal the End of 'Giving In to the Man' in the Entertainment Industry?,"Ama Yawson, ContributorAuthor of Sunne's Gift: How Sunne Overcame Bullying to Reclaim...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lupita-nyongos-rise_b_5285595.html,It seems as if in almost every way Lupita Nyong'o defies the traditional Hollywood standard of beauty.  She shows us that beauty has no formulas.,2014-05-13,"Lupita Nyong'o arrives at the Oscars on Sunday, March 2, 2014, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badf9b31f0000df0022d103.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In September of 2013, Julie Chen, a co-host of The Talk, revealed that she had undergone plastic surgery two decades earlier in order to enlarge her ""Asian eyes."" A big-time agent told her in plain English that he would not represent her unless she received plastic surgery to make her eyes bigger. This agent echoed the sentiments of her news director who told her that her ""Asian eyes"" made her unrelatable to mainstream audiences. Ms. Chen decided to have the surgery done despite the surgical risks, the year-long recovery and the threat that some relatives would disown her. Although Ms. Chen says that she has no regrets (her career did take off after the surgery), she wonders if she ""gave in to the man.""Yes, in my view, she ""gave in to the man."" At least two literal and proverbial white men told her that she did not look good enough and or that she had to have surgery to look more white and she did just that. This is a textbook example of giving in to the man. Does her decision make her a bad person? No. In the past, I have ""given into the man"" through the use of relaxers, weaves and skin lighteners, and I don't think that I'm a bad person. Does it make her unworthy of her success? No. She has worked hard.While it is true that the entertainment industry is brutal for people of all races, Kelly Barrett, a 36-year-old white actress who is filming on the CW's The 100 this summer, expresses the constant pressure to ""look good"" and her constant anxiety surrounding her skin, hair and body. As she ages, she says that the temptation to use Botox also increases. But women of color face these general pressures in addition to the specific pressure to dilute the God-given features that uniquely mark them as being Asian or African descendants. And although there is a wide variety of features with respect to skin tone, hair texture, and eye shape within these groups, the vestiges of slavery and colonialism have made features that bear more of a similarity to those found in Europe more valued in the global entertainment industry.Vel Jones, an African-American actress and model, can attests to this fact. She says that as far as she can tell, actresses of African descent are the only women in the entertainment industry who are routinely asked if they have an arsenal of wigs to pull from because their natural hair is deemed unacceptable. When she decided to wear her hair afro-textured hair in a low-cut and give up the wigs, she was told that her look was too ""edgy"" for commercial work and she has seen the impact with respect to her earnings. Vel Jones / Photo courtesy of Vel JonesThe internal and external pressure to look ""more white"" through make-up, surgery, skin-lightening treatments, relaxers, weaves and/or wigs can be seen in the drastic transformations of South African pop singer Mshoza and Somali model Iman.But the recent selection of Lupita Nyong'o as ""Most Beautiful"" by People magazine gives me a certain degree of optimism that change is on the horizon. Lupita Nyong'o looks very different from fellow ""most beautifuls,"" such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Lopez, Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore, Halle Berry and Angelina Jolie. It seems as if in almost every way Lupita Nyong'o defies the traditional Hollywood standard of beauty. She shows us that beauty has no formulas. We can imagine that some people have suggested that she bleach her skin, put a weave in her hair, get a nose job and or augment her breasts. Yet as far as we know, she has succumbed to no one and nothing. She remains black, beautiful and brilliant without any hint of an apology. Lupita Nyong'o embodies the lesson of my inspirational children's book, Sunne's Gift: There is beauty and power in difference.To me, she represents a transformational figure who enlarges our vision of what is possible such as Oprah Winfrey and President Barack Obama. There is always skepticism at the brink of transformation. Both Oprah Winfrey and President Obama were the targets of naysayers. People thought that the Oprah show would not last. One of my best friends told me that it would be a cold day in hell before a black man named Barack Obama becomes the president of the United States. Similarly, when I posted this celebratory photo of myself and Lupita on Facebook with the caption ""I feel like I won,"" one of my Facebook friends accused me of seeking white validation and then proceeded to imply that Lupita's win was just charity and that if her career continues she will only get roles as maids and slaves. Lupita and me I see more for Lupita Nyong'o. Her diverse fanbase and her proven marketability reveal much more. Her career trajectory shows us a case in which a woman of color did not have to ""give in to the man"" to get ahead. Her success shows that people who look vastly different from her are able to relate to her.This last point is crucial. We live in a media environment in which both the victories and tragedies experienced by women of color in the United States and abroad are often ignored by mainstream media because those in power falsely believe that the mainstream would never relate. Would the Nigerian girls kidnapped by Boko Haram or the Indonesian woman who may be caned publicly after being gang-raped receive more immediate attention if those victims bleached their skin, added weaves their hair, received nose jobs and other surgeries to make them more relatable?Although I am vocal about the inspiration that I receive by seeing women who look like me on screen, I never stopped enjoying movies with non-black protagonists due to a failure to relate to those characters. They are human and I am human, therefore we can relate.The success of Lupita Nyong'o and other unapologetic actors who refuse to apologize for their ""ethnic"" features is crucial because as the mainstream relates to them on-screen they will also begin to relate to the real life dramas of people of color that unfold off-screen. More empathy for each is other is exactly what we need to effect change. Change does not happen overnight -- but it can happen. In short, power to all the actors and actresses out there who refuse to ""give in to the man."""
4,POLITICS,Time to Smack Down Trespassing Vigilantes and Thugs,"Mark Boslough, ContributorPhysicist; Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/time-to-smack-down-trespa_b_5307138.html,"Unfortunately, there is a dangerous and growing movement spawned by greedy welfare ranchers and motorized recreation industries to grab public treasure for their own gain.",2014-05-13,2014-05-12-laapphotoaptopixpubliclandsutahshowdownjpg20140510.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-12-laapphotoaptopixpubliclandsutahshowdownjpg20140510-thumb.jpg,"""This land is your land, this land is my land,"" Woody Guthrie, 1952.""This is OUR land,"" Jarbidge Shovel Brigade Official Web Site, 2002.On Sept. 1, 1846, my great-grandfather's great-grandfather camped with his family in a place that is now the outskirts of Elko, Nevada. It was a silent night. There were no roads for hundreds of miles. It would be over a half century before the first automobile would be built. It would be a full century before Cliven Bundy's father would begin grazing cattle on the federal land that pioneers like my ancestors conquered.Things have changed since the 1840s. Today, only the most inaccessible fragments of our shared land are unmarred by intrusions.The few remaining wild, roadless areas are special, spectacular places, with untracked deserts, grassy prairies, and healthy forests. Wildlife and archaeological sites are protected by isolation, and people can visit for solitude and rejuvenation. This land is your land.Without protection, roads and development will eventually swallow up the last places. Unfortunately, there is a dangerous and growing movement spawned by greedy welfare ranchers and motorized recreation industries to grab this public treasure for their own gain.The latest ugly manifestation of this movement was Saturday's armed and motorized invasion of Recapture Canyon, a remote area rich in Native American ruins -- and sacred burial grounds -- near Blanding, Utah. Our democratically-elected federal government has jurisdiction over it on our behalf. Like racist rancher Cliven Bundy of Nevada, the invaders do not recognize the authority of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people -- at least not all the people. Americans fought and died for this land, but the invaders do not think it belongs to the American people. They think it belongs to them. Photojournalists captured them racing unhelmeted across the landscape with children in tow, as if competing for this year's Darwin Award. Some were waving American flags with no sense of irony over the fact that they are trashing -- both physically and metaphorically -- what it stands for. (Trent Nelson / Salt Lake Tribune)There is a long history of disrespect for public land and its owners by off-road joy riders (and their industry supporters) in the West. More than a decade ago, a vigilante group called the ""Jarbidge Shovel Brigade"" was formed to seize the control of public lands in Elko County, Nevada. In 1995, a road to the Jarbidge Wilderness Area washed out. To protect the nearby Jarbidge River and its endangered bull trout fishery from soil erosion, the U.S. Forest Service decided to keep the streamside road closed to motor vehicles. The road was blocked off with large boulders.This did not sit well with some locals, who organized a work party to defy federal protection of our public land and take the law into their own hands. On July 4, 2000, they converged on the site, removed the boulders, and built their own unauthorized road. The Forest Service, wanting to avoid confrontation, let the matter go. By abdicating their duty to protect the land that belongs to all citizens, they set the stage for the Bundy debacle, and now the lawlessness in Recapture Canyon.The philosophy of the burgeoning anti-government movement seems to be this: they can do anything they want anywhere they want, regardless of environmental harm, federal protective rulings to the contrary, or the will of their fellow citizens. And they will use threats and violence to get their way.It is important to recognize that these groups do not limit their aggressive intrusions to public lands. They also invade lands owned by private individuals who don't want motorized trespassers on their property. I learned this firsthand when I attempted to prevent motorized use of a creek bed on my family's property in Boulder County, Colorado.In 1999, I posted ""no motorized vehicles"" signs along our creek. That spring, a group of 15 vehicles from the Denver-based Mile-Hi Jeep Club ignored my signs and drove through. The club's web site even reported that one vehicle dumped a crankcase load of oil into our creek.So, that summer I did what the Forest Service did in Elko County. I blocked the trail. This was unacceptable to some members of the offroad club. They organized a ""Barking Dog Shovel Brigade"" led by local activist Vernon Brandt (who was later convicted of a felony for beating up an elderly man over his ""right"" to a parking space). The club removed my boulder and worked on an amateur road construction project on private land they had no right to enter.Unlike the Forest Service, I didn't let it slide. I brought in another truckload of boulders. Later, I smacked down the vigilantes by prevailing in a lawsuit to keep trespassers off my land. Fourteen years later, the ""road"" is gone. The streamside wildflowers, grasses, willows, and aspen trees that were crushed under the ATV and Jeep tires have grown back. The Mile-Hi Jeep Club's oil slick is gone, and I have picked up most of their trash and vehicle parts.We need federal agencies that are as willing to stand up to violent trespassing thugs and vigilante groups as I was. It is time to put pressure on the BLM and the Forest Service to uphold the law. After all, this land belongs to you and me."

We have it in spades, because we are a blogging duo. While we aren't the only ones who do this, it's pretty darn unique in the blogosphere. While for us it's just blogging business as usual, even we have to admit that it's a special friendship that can successfully transition into a writing partnership.Our friendship began 10 years ago when our daughters shared a gymnastics class and we were stuck in the waiting room suffering through the whines of younger siblings and the smell of a million stinky feet.The idea of a blog took awhile to come about, though.Erin: It began in 2011 during a routine phone conversation about our older kids.Ellen: Nothing new there.Erin:  We were both laughing out loud and I said, ""We should write a blog about this"".Ellen: And I said, ""What's a blog?""Erin: And I replied, ""This. Women write about parenting and stuff online. And people read it.""Ellen: Well, sure, of course, that sounded like a super swell idea.Erin:The funny thing was, it did -- at least to me. I kept coming around to the idea that I had a great group of friends and we were beyond the potty-training, sleep-training, training-anything talk. In fact, we all just talked -- graciously, openly, honestly about everything. Our conversations took us from movies we loved to books we hated; and all the way through great things happening with our kids to really crappy things we didn't see coming. I kept thinking about Raymond Carver's story that I love called ""What I Talk About When I Talk About Love.""Ellen: Erin does like to quote books.Erin: My thought was that I might write something like ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Movies and Books and Kids and Life"". But I didn't and wouldn't until that fateful, ordinary phone call with Ellen.Ellen: When brilliance was born.Erin: And Ellen is a huge fan of hyperbole.But looking around the internet, maybe Ellen wasn't that much off the mark after all. There is, of course, the obvious advantage in that we can divide and conquer all the tasks of blogging. But there are other more subtle gifts as well. With two of us, we tend to chat a bit about how things are going: What we want to do more, what we want to do less and what we never, ever, ever want to do again. All this talking means that we are communicating about our short-term goals, our long-term goals and our blog constantly. It means we are bouncing ideas off of one another and helping each other stay on track. It means we are picking each other up, pushing each other forward, and helping each other find a way through. On the ship that is our blog, this friendship is the rudder.And every blogger can use one of those. To the outside world, blogging can seem like a solitary endeavor with millions of writers sitting alone filling computer screens with words. Bloggers know better. Blogging is just partly about writing; it is really about making connections. You put your heart on your sleeve, or rather your soul on your blog, and people respond. You make friends. Some of them are other bloggers and you start to gather around the ""watercooler"" in Facebook groups, in Google circles or on Twitter. Before you know it, you have a group of colleagues/friends who are there to support you, who help you grow professionally, who are there as you try to steer your ship.We don't know how to tell you to find your Ellen or your Erin, but we do know how you can find your rudder: The BlogU Conference. This conference is about intimacy and making connections. It's about finding the crew that will help you stay on track, weather the storms, and chart a course for success. BlogU even comes with its own watercooler, a private Facebook group. Even before the conference has begun, ideas are being shared, help is being offered and networking is taking place. BlogU offers an opportunity to collaborate and grow your blog that's pretty unique in the blogosphere. With opportunities to collaborate with experienced, successful bloggers, classes to refine some of the fundamentals of the business and a relaxed fun atmosphere, BlogU has everything you need to navigate your way through the tricky waters of social media. So are you ready to start a blog or take yours to the next level? Looking for support for your writing or business goals? Searching for that sweet spot of collaboration? Well, all hands on deck, the BlogU Conference is about to set sail. Don't miss the boat!

6,FIFTY,These Vintage Ads Prove We Had No Idea What The Future Would Actually Look Like,Yagana Shah,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/things-of-the-future_n_5254491.html,,2014-05-12,"The Jetson family wave as they fly past buildings in space in their spaceship in a still from the animated television series, 'The Jetsons,' circa 1962.

While you may laugh at the idea of every household having a robot, flying cars, and supercomputers, it was the beginning of the Space Age in the 1950s and 1960s, and futurism was all the rage. And if these vintage ads and images are anything to go by... it's exactly what people wanted to see. They were right on about some things... but the design could use a little work.These days, we have a word for ""a phone that talks back"": voicemail.Air-conditioned public transport seems to be doing the trick for us.Automatic sliding doors turned out to be a much easier solution.We're till working on this one... although Amazon drones could be on the way.This actually looks a little dangerous...This looks familiar... self check-in anyone?You can now get practically everything delivered to you ... from late-night cookies to your favorite sweet and sour chicken. They were right. Food trucks are simply delightful. Good God... please let us see these in our lifetime."
7,TRAVEL,Summer Skiing: Get Your Snow Fix During North America's Off-season,"Liftopia, ContributorSki deals online - www.liftopia.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/summer-skiing-get-your-sn_b_5248563.html,"Today, there are more than 5,000 ski areas around the world and while some 97 percent of these are closed between May and October, a stoic 150 or so do stay open during the six months of the year when the rest do not.",2014-05-12,2014-05-12-PhotocreditSnowbirdSkiandSummerResort.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-12-PhotocreditSnowbirdSkiandSummerResort-thumb.jpg,"For those that crave the snow even when winter is over -- fear not! Somewhere in the world, at almost any time of the day, a snowy slope is open for your skiing or boarding pleasure.Today, there are more than 5,000 ski areas around the world and while some 97 percent of these are closed between May and October, a stoic 150 or so do stay open during the six months of the year when the rest do not.One hundred or so of these ski areas are located in the Southern Hemisphere, which is the place to go from June to September if you want real winter conditions (You can choose amongst Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, or even South Africa and Lesotho). And if you live near one of the world's 50+ indoor snow centers, consider yourself lucky because you can satisfy your snow craving any time you'd like.PHOTO: Afriski ResortBut for those who like their snow outdoors and aren't able to make it out overseas, here's a quick guide to where you can get your annual snow fix all year around!MAYAlthough most Canadian and U.S. resorts have traded in their snowy slopes for Summer preparations, there's usually about a dozen that stretch their ski seasons well into May, June or July.This year, despite starting the season off with a drought, California's bases have been building within the past month. As a result, Mammoth, which has passed the seven-foot base mark, says they now plan to stay open until at least Memorial Day. In 2011, during the last super snowy winter, Mammoth was one of nine California ski areas (12 in North America) that stayed open for the 4th of July. They have stretched their ski season as late as August.In Colorado, Arapahoe Basin is usually open up until June and its closing date is decided on a week-by-week basis, depending on the conditions.Two other good bets for skiing towards the end of May are Mt. Bachelor in Oregon and Snowbird, Utah. Mt. Bachelor is currently offering a spring skiing pass valid until May 25th.Over in the East, Killington manages to maintain its season late into spring by piling a lot of snow on its main high run in order battle mother nature's thaw.North of the border in Canada, Sunshine at Lake Louise is planning on staying open until May 19th this year. Whistler's Blackcomb glacier is also open until around the same time and re-opens in the Summer for their Summer Glacier Camps.JUNEPHOTO: Crystal Mountain ResortSome of the California and Colorado resorts that were open May still stay open in June; however, the options greatly decrease as Summer hits.One resort that we have not mentioned yet is Crystal Mountain in Washington State, which is often open until Independence Day and usually stays open at least late-June. This year, the Red Lodge Racing Camp in Montana actually kicks off its season on May 24th and usually operates into June.Or, if you fancy a long flight to find winter, ski areas in the Southern Hemisphere begin to open in June.SUMMER (July to September)During the last week of June and through July, Whistler Blackcomb opens their Summer Glacier Camps for both skiers and rider, offering wide range of snow camps to choose from (June 22nd - July 28th, 2014).Timberline in Mt. Hood in Oregon is the closet thing to year-round skiing in North America. In a good year, it's open almost every month of the year, with three or four weeks closure for maintenance in September.Outside of North America, it's high season in the Southern Hemisphere and in the Alps, where around 20 glacier ski areas are open for part or all of the Summer. Hintertux in Austria and Zermatt in Switzerland (which operates the continent's highest lifts) endeavour to open 365 days a year.OCTOBERAnd so it all begins again.In the beginning of October, we'll start hearing news from high resorts in Colorado -- particularly Arapahoe Basin, Loveland and Copper -- that they've started night-time snowmaking operations and ready to kick off winter 2014-15!PHOTO: Snowbird Ski and Summer ResortThere's a similar battle on the East Coast, with Killington usually as a leading player.Let's not forget that Mother Nature does tend to throw some curveballs, both good and bad. Steven's Pass in Washington State received two feet of snow in the first week of October, resulting in its earliest opening ever.This time of the year, the season in the Southern Hemisphere starts winding down with most resorts closed by early October. In the Alps, there's a similar feeling that summer skiing is over and it's time to build up to the coming winter.Oh dear, I'm already getting excited for 2014-15 season and it's only May.
