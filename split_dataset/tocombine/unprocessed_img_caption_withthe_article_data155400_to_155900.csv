On Wednesday, the pop star told New York radio host Elvis Duran that her upcoming 3D concert movie will touch on her split from estranged husband Marc Anthony. ""I'd been through a big change in my life with the divorce and everything, and as crazy as we are we thought let's put that on camera!"" she told Duran (via MTV UK). In August 2012, Lopez's manager Benny Medina first revealed to ""Extra"" that the singer was shooting footage for a 3D concert movie called ""Dance Again"" -- the same name as her hit song with Pitbull and the title of her 2012 world tour. Lopez appears to be following in the footsteps of Perry, who released a concert movie -- ""Katy Perry: Part of Me 3D""  -- in July 2012 that chronicled her ""California Dreams"" tour and  divorce from British comedian Russell Brand. Lopez and Anthony -- who are parents to 5-year-old twins -- first announced their split in July 2011. Anthony filed for divorce the following year in April 2012. Since the split, Lopez, 43, has been been dating 26-year-old choreographer and ""Dance Again"" creative director Casper Smart. Watch the video above for a clip from Lopez's radio show interview.

And when a major company tells a teenager that they're not worthy of shopping at their store because her ass is too big, what does that say to her?",2013-05-08,"The logo for Abercrombie & Fitch Co. is displayed outside their store on Burlington Gardens in central London, U.K., on Monday, Feb. 25, 2013.

Photographer: Jason Alden/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d24282000003100fdd857.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wow. My mind was blown today. A friend sent me this article about Abercrombie & Fitch.Do you remember shopping there when you were in college? I sure do. (Do they still smell like a junior high dance where the boys put on waaaay too much of dad's cologne and they play the music so loud you might get permanent hearing loss?) In fact, I think I still have my classic Abercrombie sweatshirt in my closet. Well, apparently, we shopped at A&F back when they were selling ""fuddy duddy"" clothes. (That sounds about right for me. I have rarely been on the cutting edge of fashion.) Nowadays, A&F has this total jackhole, Mike Jeffries, running the company and he's doing a really kick ass job (stock price is up, sales are up, new stores everywhere, blah, blah, blah) and he has a secret to his success: He only hires beautiful, thin ""cool kids"" so that they will only attract other beautiful, thin ""cool kids"" to shop at his stores, because he doesn't want losers even setting a hairy, fugly foot in his hallowed halls. And just in case the message didn't get through to the uncool, the ugly and the fat people that there is nothing here for you, Mike wants to make it clear that you're not welcome and so he has decreed that the women's clothing line will not carry clothing bigger than a size L or 10.""In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids,"" he told Salon.com. ""Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely."" When I first read this article, I didn't know if I was more impressed with the fact that Jeffries owns his asshole ways or if I was more disgusted that he's such a f*cking d*ckhead who is desperately trying to hold on to his glory days of high school. (Actually, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that Mikey was a total la-hooo-zer back in the day. Look at how hard he's fought for those bulging biceps and how much he's paid for those sun-kissed locks -- and eyebrows WTF? -- and bee-stung lips. He looks like a genetically engineered geriatric douchebag.) He's an absolute creeper and I don't care how much he owns his actions, they're unacceptable.  When we have young women all over this country suffering from poor body image, I am disgusted that companies like this exist and are flourishing. A size 10 is big?! And it's not just the girls, either. I've spent enough summers at the public pool to know that the average teenage boy doesn't have the chiseled body featured in A&F's steamy ad campaigns. (Luckily, they do make men's XL clothes, though, mostly to cater to the beefier athletes.)For Jeffries to come right out and say his company philosophy is to be ""exclusionary"" makes me want to scream and burn my (Size XL) Abercrombie sweatshirt in effigy and break things (preferably a display of polo shirts at my local A&F). I am trying to raise children in this world who have a sense of self-worth (that doesn't come from their stupid fucking jeans) and he continues to do whatever he can to make children feel excluded. Yes, teenagers are still children. And when a major company tells a teenager that they're not worthy of shopping at their store because her ass is too big, what does that say to her? Believe me, she's already self-conscious about that ass, she doesn't need Abercrombie & Fitch telling her that she's too horrible to buy a pair of their jeans. Nice work, d*ckhead.In the 1990s, Jeffries took over a dying company that sold ""fuddy duddy"" clothes and turned it into the Mecca of Morons. Reading the articles and looking through the photos of Jeffries and his young employees made me feel sick to my stomach. This company embodies everything I despise. Ignorant, selfish, entitled, foolish, arrogant, elitist assholes who sit around with their fellow douchey ""dudes"" in their perfectly (identically) ripped jeans and their stupid f*cking racist/sexist t-shirts with gems like ""Tig Ole Bitties"" and ""Two Wongs Make a White"" and yuk it up about raiding mommy's medicine cabinet or maxing out daddy's credit card while their asshole parents neglect them to spend time on the slopes or at the beach.These are the same type of kids who tweet racist shit and tell their sorority sisters to stop being so f*cking boring when frat boys are around. These are the same type of kids who received Participation Awards for every f*cking thing in their lives and have that shit lined up on a shelf in their room, because that reminds them that they're precious snowflakes. These are the same type of kids who kill referees at soccer games. I hate these people more than you know.My children are not old enough to grace the abs-infested aisles of A&F just yet, but the first time either of my kids asks for anything from this store, I will say Hell F*cking No. I realize that won't matter much to Mr. Jeffries. After all, I'm way too old, fat, short and ugly to be allowed in his store. (I'm surprised he doesn't have bouncers at the door to turn away people like me.) He doesn't care what I think, because I'm not his clientele. Well, that's too bad, because he should care about me and other mothers like me. I am a mother who will influence and educate my kids about shopping consciously. I will raise kids like these girls who ""girlcott"" places like A&F. I will explain to my kids that we don't support companies that sexualize teens or marginalize people. We will put our money where our mouths are and we will buy our perfectly distressed $100 jeans ANYWHERE else, but A&F.A&F can kiss my fat ass!Read more of Jen at People I Want to Punch in the Throat and follow her on Facebook and Twitter."

Although I guarantee for some, you will never interpret vegetables the same way upon completion. Dating and love would have to be the two most complex, jaded and convoluted topics. Humankind has manifested machines soaring higher than the universe. We have created cars that accelerate faster than the human heartbeat. In addition, we have engineered phantom limbs and accessories functioning similar to their real counterparts and additional mysterious inventions. Yet in this day and age, we are still unable to create an explanation for the hidden meaning behind dating and love. What is love? Apparently, the masses seem to know more than the other otherwise bookstores would not carry mountains of literature on the topic; and professionals would not specialize in the biochemistry anatomy of the repercussions of this luminous endorphin -- all in the name of love.I requested a solution from the universe as to why some people sizzle and some fizzle. What a miracle, just then, that following weekend the answer transmitted through unfolding events. During the same weekend, while food shopping, the boomerang effect delivered and activated an ""A-ha"" memo. After accepting the reality of that moment, the conclusion was very simple: broccoli and cauliflower are not compatible to date. Before I decipher this further, let us go back to basics. In real life though the mentioned vegetables are similar, and belong to the same cruciferous category, with almost similar texture they do not produce the same benefits. Aside from the difference in hues, there remains an abundance of contrasts; the same speaks for green, yellow, red, and orange peppers.I hope we are marching towards some form of awareness thus far. The two vegetables love and enjoy their lives together, however just because they share similarities it does not mean they are meant to share the same shelf life forever. Life's events may bring them both together to coexist on the same plate in a vegetable medley or not. Perhaps they seek to display such false advertising that they are capable of synchronization but in reality, the lack of acceptance of their differences remains their demise. Therefore, the broccoli courageously pursues its life living within its comfort while acknowledging its contribution to the masses and perhaps the cauliflower has yet to catch up or vice versa.Life is funny that way, because as humans we tend to gravitate to what is familiar, comfortable, and safe. However, when events ignite our energies to something new, wild, and exotic, we are openly receptive yet it becomes an indecisive double-dutch match when faced to choose between the two options. The choice falls into to two categories: risk versus safety net. Is the cauliflower willing to accept the broccoli and their differences? If the answer is yes, then it becomes a match made in heaven, if the answer is no, then clearly broccoli and cauliflower should not date."

Researchers used the USDA's healthy eating index; on average, fast food meals only improved from 45 to 48 of 100 possible points. In comparison, the average American’s diet has a score of 55.Researchers point the finger at the eight chains analyzed in the study: McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), Arby’s, Jack in the Box and Dairy Queen.""More than one quarter of American adults consume fast food two or more times per week,"" the study reads. ""Fast food accounts for 15 percent of Americans’ daily energy intake.

Among them, McDonald's decision to cut the amount of fries in its Happy Meals and add apple slices. Still, the study's researchers determined this is not enough to make up for the ""substantial disparity between current menu offerings and many of the components of the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans.""Margo Wootan, the director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, was dismayed by the lack of improvement.

I can help you! It's been years since we were girlfriends, but I really know how to find men and it's so simple, as they are everywhere!  I've been explaining, ""How to get a man,"" to my dress customers for over 50 years, since they are always complaining about needing one. I tell them where to look.  First of all, It's All About The Dress, as I explain in my book. Martha, you need to change your look. Men hate boxy jackets, pale lips, motherly shoes and beige.You used to wear my dresses. Remember, see thru lace, fitted tops, peek a boo holes, pushed up busts and hot pink, red, turquoise and black. You send a message with your clothes that I love my body and I love sex. Men don't want a school teacher. I fought the early feminists about looking sexy. I believed that you could run a company and not look like a man. I was right, the next generation of feminists gave up and allowed the décolleté. I wore low cut dresses all my life and once was taken out of a board room in the Sears Tower in Chicago by a lady VP. I was taken to the bathroom under orders to turn my blouse around.  I tell women to ""find a man in a different category from your past men"" and to ""find a man who does not compete with you."" This will be hard because you are great at everything Martha, but a rocket scientist or a French professor would fit the bill. So put on a turquoise fitted low cut dress, dear Martha, and go to one of the places I list below.  Here is my perfected list of where to find men:   The top state: Alaska. Take a drive out of Fairbanks with a girlfriend (I'm available) and hit the cafes in the mountain towns early for breakfast. The cafe in Eagle River has 20 single men all alone every day.  The top city: Pensacola, Florida. There are some 200,000 military men mostly single, and there are also wealthy plane and weapons manufacturers. Once I met a cute single guy at the Pensacola airport (the number one airport for finding a man) about 15 years ago who told me he made a new secret weapon (called a Drone) in a New Jersey factory, and not to tell anybody. Of course I'm married and said ""no"" to a date, but I keep his card in a stack of cards from all the men I meet all over the world, for lonely girlfriends.  The top place in town: sporting events, baseball games, basketball games. There are big crowds of men to choose from. When you go to big stadiums talk to all the people around. If your area has no one that excites you, get drinks and move around. The gym is also great as you can check out their bodies. Develop a pick up line. My line was, ""Can you help me?"" That may be a good line to practice Martha, then bat your eyes and smile sweetly and he's yours.  The ashram is the gym for the spiritual crowd and men are meditating alone, visiting the ashram for a life change (you!). Skiing, golf, bicycle riding as all sports are great ways to meet men, as well as dog walking in cities like New York and Paris. What's your dog's name? Please don't wear athletic clothing. See thru lace undershirts with a different colored bra showing is a yes!  The easiest place: Sunday morning at the local gas station-cafe with seats. Men who are unmarried meet for ritual Sunday coffee chat, and they love to answer car questions. ""Are my tires OK?""   The top place on the planet Earth to find an older rich man all alone: an African safari. Trust me, go alone.  To find a young rich man go the Grand Prix of Monaco; to find a real American bachelor, the Talladega racetrack in Alabama; to find a Southern gent, the Masters in Georgia. You don't have assigned seats. Forget most cruises, (except singles cruses), but the competition is so great. Forget the beach resorts unless you have the killer body.  I disagree about weddings being great spots to find men, there's too much pressure, but nightclubs are great! In Paris, we have Castel's, which is a private club. The perfect spot for a fling! Nathalie Delon, married to France's hunkiest 60's actor, Alain Delon, taught me how to pick up a total stranger in a club. You pick him out in the crowd, catch his eye, and with a sly smile, simply curl your finger up with your outstretched arm and beckon him. So simple, if you catch their eye, they come! Now, she broke up France's greatest romance, Romy Schneider and Alain Delon. Nathalie married him in weeks. She is a male magnet. It still works today as mating rituals stay the same.  Bars are obvious pick up places but you risk falling for an alcoholic. Gambling casinos are also great, but you risk a gambler. Church is ok, but stay away from sexy preachers. I prefer art galleries, concerts and gourmet grocery stores, as my big turn on is men who can cook, but maybe, Martha you don't.   I also like transportation; planes, trains, buses, as you can move around. Have your lines prepared. ""Can you help me,"" always works, but ""Who are you?,"" isn't bad either.   The last resort is having your girlfriends introduce you or doing Internet dating. Blind dates. I prefer seeing men in person and getting goosebumps. If it must be blind, I prefer to let my girlfriends choose, they can vet the guy better, as everyone I know sends 20 year old photos into the dating sites and everyone tells lies about themselves.  Actually, both my husbands mis-represented their ""likes."" My first husband said he liked going to the movies (he made movies), but after a year of dating he confessed to hating going to the movies, he was sick of them. He liked to play tennis, but I didn't play, so he didn't tell me. Ah, men!   The biggest problem in finding a man is being too picky. Give a guy who really likes you a chance. The biggest problem in keeping a man is not giving them the sex they dream of. How to give good sex is a must! And, forget pole dancing. Remember, practice makes perfect!   Men don't leave women with professional technique, and for many ladies, taking care of your man is a hot turn on. Learning ""all the right moves ""is a good thing!
