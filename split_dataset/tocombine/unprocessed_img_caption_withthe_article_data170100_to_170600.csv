Your financial planner might also be that extra motivation or accountability you need to keep you on track with your goals. (Check out our first webinar about financial organization for some great tips!)So how do you know if you need one? The truth is, not everyone does. If you're the type of person who does your research, is always aware of where your money is going, and knows exactly how much you need to save each month towards your retirement and other goals, you'll most likely be fine without a financial planner. In this case, you might want to seek advice just to get a second opinion and confirm that you're on the right track. But for those of us that are newbies to the personal finance world with no time to do adequate research, we probably have more than a few blind spots, and a professional eye can really help.This definitely doesn't mean you should go hire the cheapest financial planner you can find (or the most expensive). The costs of financial planners' services do not necessarily reflect their expertise. Remember to ask yourself a couple key questions:-- Is this person adding value to my overall financial situation? -- Am I receiving quality information and the assistance I need to improve my finances?So How Do I Choose a Financial Planner?Credentials/Experience: Basically anyone can claim to be a financial planner, but you'll want to make sure the person you hire knows what he or she is talking about! If there's a CFP after the name, that means the individual is credentialed by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards. This is a good indicator of a high level of financial education as well as a commitment to ethics. (Of course this shouldn't be the only factor you base your decision on).Objectivity/Fee Structure: Some financial planners work for a commission, meaning every time they get you to purchase a particular financial product, they make money. Obviously this doesn't give them very much incentive to give you an honest opinion of your financial situation. Your best bet is to go with a financial adviser who is fee-only and/or charges an hourly rate.Fiduciary: This fancy word means the financial planner has made a commitment to work in the clients' best interests at all times. This is the difference between a planner creating a financial plan that is acceptable for you versus building one that is tailored to your financial goals and current situation.Specialty/Expertise: Financial planners can have different specialties, and you want to make sure that the one you choose is a good match for what you need. They can work primarily with retired clients or newly married couples, etc. What areas are they used to addressing? What types of clients make up the majority of their experience?Finally, the last thing you should check off is whether or not you feel comfortable working with the person. Go with your gut! If something tells you this person is unsavory or untrustworthy, chances are that you're right. And even if that's not always true, you should definitely feel comfortable with the person who you're receiving financial advice from.We hope this provides useful information for you on your financial journey!

The Russian-born beauty wore a pair of tight-fitting leather pants (which showcased her amazing gams) and flat suede booties (her 6'2"" frame doesn't need much of a boost). She topped her ensemble off with a big sweater and an oversized statement coat; thankfully her tall frame was not overwhelmed by all the extra fabric. We love how she paired her outfit with a slouchy purse -- so functional and effortless. This is a look that we would easily wear to run errands, go out for dinner or head into the office, as it's the perfect mix of comfort and style. WHERE: The athlete was seen with fellow tennis players Ana Ivanovic, Roberta Vinci and Sara Errani in Milan on December 3rd.

In particular, Braxton has a soft spot for china, faberge eggs and sheets -- one thousand thread count to be exact. And though she was able to get herself out of financial distress for many years after her initial decline, her money problems returned in 2010 when she lost her Georgia home. During that time she considered posing for Playboy to pay the bills she admits, but ultimately opted against it. But don’t feel too bad for the unbreakable singer. She currently lives in Los Angeles in a house that can be seen on her reality show, Braxton Family Values. Even her sister Traci Braxton isn't regretful of her Toni's problems. “If this is what it means to be bankrupt, sign me up” she said. “Did you see the size of that pool?”We couldn't have said it better ourselves.
