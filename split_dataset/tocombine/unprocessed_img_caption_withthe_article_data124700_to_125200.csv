Mexican health authorities are worried about a spike in the number of H1N1 flu cases and deaths, in the country that was the epicenter of the 2009 outbreak of the strain. The Health Department says the figures remain well below 2009 levels. (AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df432250000330036a850.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Despite stringent state rules that make it difficult for parents to exempt children from immunization, an alarming number of New York City private schools have vaccination rates lower than the 95 percent that officials say is necessary to prevent the spread of measles. According to state data obtained by Daily Intelligencer, 125 private schools had vaccination rates below 90 percent and 37 schools recorded below 70 percent.Nine private schools have rates so low that, were they countries, they would qualify among the worst in the world, the Intelligencer reports. The lowest, according to state data, is the Early Learning Center and the Academy of Art in Queens, which has a rate of just 18.4 percent. The breakdown follows a recent measles outbreak in upper Manhattan, along with parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn. As of two weeks ago, the city confirmed at least 20 cases of the highly infectious disease. The outbreak prompted an investigation into whether hospitals failed to properly identify measles symptoms quickly enough to prevent it from spreading. While the city's private schools have an overall immunization rate at 97 percent, experts say the handful of schools with disconcertingly low levels still pose a dangerous threat to children's health, especially as more parents seek to obtain vaccine waivers and anti-vaccinators continue to turn to private schools. ""As more people choose not to vaccinate based on personal belief, our communities are at risk -- we have seen recent outbreaks of diseases like measles, mumps and whooping cough throughout the U.S,"" Kristen A. Feemster argued in a recent debate for The New York Times. ""It is prudent policy to limit such exemptions to protect our own and the public’s health.""Led in large part by actress turned activist Jenny McCarthy, the call for personal choice to thump scientific research has thrusted the vaccination debate back into conversation. The movement is also unique in that it transcends economic and political ideology. Calfornia's Marin County, one of the wealthiest areas in the United States, has also seen a spike in unvaccinated children because of the state's personal belief loophole, Marin News reports. From 2005 to 2012-2013, the rate at which parents have opted for the waiver nearly doubled, from 4.2 percent to 7.83 percent. "

Nietzsche, ""The Gay Science,"" section 76In our ""crazybusy"" adult lives, dating has become extremely speedy and contrived with people ""pencilling in"" business-like Starbucks rendezvouses that are not dissimilar from job interviews or writer-directors auditioning actors to play the leading roles in their screenplays entitled, ""This Is What I Think My Life Should Look Like."" After college - take note, young people - organically getting to know fellow humans outside of work, bars, and a few social activities is becoming increasingly difficult. I recently watched the politically scintillating first season of ""The Newsroom"" and was appalled to find that most of the (egregiously dysfunctional) romantic relationships portrayed on the show are between people who work closely together. I am quite certain that America's equivalent to Shakespeare, Aaron Sorkin, is familiar with the phrase ""Don't crap where you eat,"" so I am wondering if this is really a phenomenon in contemporary offices or if it is added for dramatic effect? In either case, the couples and trebles involved appear to work better together than stand a snowball's chance in hell of growing old together.Some people feel as if technology is helping them connect but it can also be argued that Facebook and Twitter delude people into believing they are interacting when they actually are not receiving the tactile affection they crave, that people construct flagrantly inauthentic facades when social networking and dating online, and that 95% of communications are non-verbal - thus 95% of communications are lost through text messaging and emailing. ""What about Tinder?"" I hear you query. Right. There is probably no better tool to find a sugary sweet piece of arm-candy or eye-candy, but swiping left or right contingent upon someone's photoshopped headshot is probably as accurate prediction of compatibility as the SATs are to college performance. Similarly, as Cindy Gallop posits: ""Google has ruined alot of first dates!""At the risk of offending all, I shall not even mention Lori Gottlieb's provocative New York Times Magazine article ""Does a More Equal Marriage Mean Less Sex?"" wherein she argues that gender equality can be detrimental to a couple's sex life; specifically, Ms. Gottlieb cites a study claiming that wives reported greater sexual satisfaction when their husbands stuck to doing ""masculine"" chores around the house. I hope that someone conducts a parallel study regarding single people: women obviously want gender equality and equal pay (and rightfully so), but when the man doesn't buy dinner I wonder if that adversely affects the perceived sexual ""chemistry"" between them... hmmmm...?Correspondingly, you may be familiar with the concept of the myth of romantic love as explicated by Robert A. Johnson in ""We: Understanding the Psychology of Romantic Love"" wherein damsels in distress seek to be saved by knights in shining armor, and/or ""soulmates"" believe that the apple of their eyes are the missing parts of them (cf. ""Jerry Maguire"" - ""You complete me""). Such myths would constitute matrices of assumptions that we all agree upon regarding the etiquette of courtship. In our post-post modern information age, all of these assumptions regarding gender roles have been cast aside. Thus, it is unwise and often unprofitable to make assumptions regarding which partner leads when dancing, who is supposed to call whom (does anyone even use the telephone anymore???), who pays for dinner, and who makes sexual advances. In my workshops and on my DVDs I discuss what Mary Ainsworth called ""ambivalent-insecure attachment"" and ""avoidant-insecure attachment"" observing that some of my patients have a difficult time trusting that others will not abandon or betray them; thus, they sabotage their relationships before the other person can leave them, which would re-open their primal abandonment/betrayal wounds; or they don't/can't fully ever commit; or they learn how to create hardened facades (false selves) so that they can shrug their shoulders and say ""Whatever..."" as they continue to blame others and abnegate responsibility for their inauthentic ways of showing up as relationship after relationship implodes or conveniently FADES OUT.The problem is as follows: the most propitious tools for making relationships succeed - authenticity and authentic communications - may not be the most alluring traits when dating. For it is highly probable that your authentic self is not as glorious, glossy, and glamourous as the facade or false self you created in order to survive your childhood, which is the face you mostly like choose to meet the faces that you meet on Facebook and Match.com. Also, it takes time for people to grow to trust each other and allow themselves to be open, authentic and vulnerable; another paradox when unveiling yourself in front of yet another potential mirror - especially in our crazybusy society where instant gratification takes too long for many people.Thus, when we date we must be mindful of our own expectations and assumptions, our own projections, our own ways of communicating, our own psychological baggage, and our own attachment dynamics, so that we can show up authentically, make honest commitments, communicate with the utmost possible compassion and integrity, and learn how to grow intimately with another human being over a period of time. And we also must know how to have fun. :-)This is Mindful Dating. "

When she laughed, her coif shook like wind passing through branches. Her spirit name escaped me as it floated away on a fluty tone. I must have missed it as I kept my fearful eyes fixated on the windshield, watching our Balinese driver cut around motorcyclists, honking as to say, ""I will run you down."" On the way to my first day at the five-day festival, I found this woman an anomaly, but when I entered the fete, I found her one among many. A sea of leather, feathers, tie-dye, and spandex, the crowd slinked about like cats. Walking around, I overheard one man spout about his disbelief in politics as two people sat entwined on the ground massaging each others' necks meanwhile another woman on the opposite side of the grounds wrapped a snake around her neck as sacred music played.One of the first classes I took was called Alchemy of Breath: a two-hour session dedicated to breathing techniques that access alternate states of consciousness to open up the place where deep, permanent healing occurs. I expected a gentle session to ease the windpipes in lotus position, but soon found myself lying on my back huffing, puffing, and hyperventilating until my body went numb and tingled so intensely I started to cry. Soon, I entered a state of complete hysteria where I laughed so hard I could no longer breath. People around me screamed at the top of their lungs, one person pounded the floor, another cackled. Just then, I became hyper aware of my emotional pain and transitioned from laughing to sobbing.An angel came to my side and held my head, massaging my body. I slipped deeper into the altered state, discovering that my crying came from pent up anger and guilt related to my father's death two years ago. The angel stayed to help me through it. Then suddenly, the pain subsided and I felt my body turn to gel. The class ended in a circle with everyone holding hands. The rest of the day, I felt like a Mylar balloon whose ribbon had been snipped from a chair. I danced then tried tripsichore yoga, but something was amiss, so I listened to my body and went home. I couldn't return to the festival for two days, feeling overwhelmed enough by my own feelings that surfaced that I couldn't deal with the intensity of the other beings at the festival and what they were going through. Some time later, I put myself back together and attended a Kundalini class that completely rejuvenated my body and soul with refreshing rounds of breath of fire. I ended the festival with a oneness meditation and felt whole again.Everyone means well at the festival. There's a palpable longing for optimism, love, and personal growth. If you are considering going to either the popular Bali Spirit Fest or another spiritual festival in countries like South Africa, Australia or the United States ask yourself before you go if you are ready to experience the unexpected and embrace intense transformation. If so, here's some advice on how to survive a spirit fest:1. Set an intention. Ask yourself, what about myself do I want to explore further or what am I looking to heal? How do I want to grow? When you enter into meditations or new practices this will help you stay focused even if other stuff comes up. 2. Come prepared. Bring a yoga mat and water or buy both in town, once you're at the festival things get pricey. 3. Be aware of your boundaries, then be willing to both stand up for them or push the limits. Remember, no one is asking you to stay in the classes. So, if you spend a couple minutes hula hooping or fire breathing but feel too uncomfortable you can walk away to either take a break or drop in on another class.4. Let expectations go to welcome the experience. On this journey, the unexpected will occur. Likely, you've traveled a long way to a foreign country on your own, which creates its own level of discomfort at the get-go. From there, anything can happen... really. At some point during the festival, I was wading through mud after heavy rains, eating pad thai with ants in it, and sweating uncontrollably. Other times I was in a crystalline pool overlooking stunning rice paddies, having heart-felt conversations with warm people, and smiling from that radiant feeling of being alive. Any event has its positives and drawbacks, so it's hard to tell before you get there what it will be like. So, go into the event as a blank slate ready to embrace whatever happens.5. Open your mind to new experiences and people. These events attract hundreds of people from all over the world, so not everyone there will have your opinions or cultural conditioning. You will feel uncomfortable at least once, but that does not mean giving up and going home. Roll with it because even those moments of friction can be blissful in retrospect. Also, it's likely you haven't sampled all the types of yoga and healing on the menu, so try something completely foreign to you just for fun.6. Establish a support group either on-site or back home whom you can report back to about your feelings as you go along. During the course of the festival, I experienced the rainbow of human emotion: I was angry, I cried, I was sad, I felt confused and vulnerable. I felt blissful, revert, awakened and optimistic. Transformation is never like walking through a golden gate over a path of pillows whether you do it at a festival or through a life coach at home. Having support is paramount to your well being. This will also help you make better sense of what you are processing. 7. Make it a point to interact with non-spirit festival people. Every moment, there will be something interesting going on at the festival, but make sure to take a day off to refresh if you need it. Find a place where you can have a beer with backpackers who aren't trying to fix themselves. In Bali, I found the co-working space Hubud comforting because it attracts business-minded people who are very practical. After that breathing class unearthed some of my spiritual garbage, I went to the co-working space the next day to just talk with people my age about music and have a good laugh about how out there hippies can be.8. Lay off the drugs. I understand some people go to festivals wanting to reach Nirvana and explore other states of consciousness, but in my opinion MDMA, mushrooms and ecstasy are a dangerous way of doing that. In fact, drugs in Bali are not a force to be reckoned with as they mean harsh punishments. Smuggling drugs into or out of the country can yield the death penalty while getting caught buying or selling drugs can lead to long jail sentences. Just don't do it.9. Hydrate and eat well. In Bali, the heat in March can be stifling, with humidity levels hitting the 80-percent range on a daily basis. If you're on a spiritual journey you must facilitate it with appropriate nutrients or you might pass out or at the least deplete yourself too early in the day.10. Reward yourself at the end. No matter what happens at the festival, arrange a couple dream activities when it's over to celebrate your boldness for making it through. In Ubud, massages go for as low as six dollars an hour for a full body treatment. There are also a plethora of beautiful, affordable restaurants to eat at like Clear Café and Sari Organik in the rice paddies. Also, Dragonfly Village hosts regular sauna parties alongside their salt-water pool.Of course, the experience is always what you put into it. If you want less intensity opt to go to the music sessions in the evening and choose to attend the festival's daytime workshops for one day instead of all five. Before I began the breath work, I put my hand on my heart and chose a number to reflect the intensity level of my experience, 10 being the most and zero the least. I said seven, and that's what I got."

This program is designed to ""release the trauma of a breakup, reclaim your power and reinvent your life."" Among other things, it supposedly helps couples understand and honor what was good about their lives together, and then let go... together.Give me a break.I know some marriages will end in divorce and that said, they should be as collaborative as possible, especially when children are involved. But how many couples do you know who have ""good divorces?"" Even those with the best of intentions often find themselves struggling as time passes.Divorce is not an easy process, no matter how you slice it.Plus, here's the biggest fallacy of all: Most of the divorces that happen in our country are based on unilateral decisions -- one person wants it and the other desperately does not. It's hard to imagine a heartbroken person being a willing participant in a consciousness-building program that both honors the marriage and destroys it at the same time. Impossible.Furthermore, even if people participate in a program that offers them insight about their marriage and years past, how exactly does that benefit children who will end up being shuffled around from one enlightened home to another?Not at all.Research indicates that even when parents do better as a result of divorce, there doesn't seem to be a trickle down effect for children as one would hope.Except in extremely dysfunctional marriages (where there is violence, chronic infidelity and substance abuse), research also tells us that kids do better when their parents work out their differences and stay together.The developer of the program ""Conscious Uncoupling"" suggests that marriage should be about personal growth, and when that no longer happens, the couples' work together is done.Hello? What planet am I from?Marriage isn't about personal growth, although you will hopefully learn and grow while you're in it. It's about a lot of things. One of the primary things marriage is about is learning relationship skills, how to have a loving, harmonious, lasting marriage. You can evolve personally on a mountainside, alone. But to be in a marriage, you have to learn how to share, give, love and collaborate.Oh yes, and one final thing... Here's a quote from Gywneth Paltrow as she announced her decision to divorce:""We are, however, and always will be a family, and in many ways we are closer than we have ever been.""No, Gynwneth, you will not always be a family. Divorce ends marriages and dissolves families.

Nothing quite inflames the ""mommy wars"" than someone who is perceived to have everything -- money, power, privilege and the real kicker, the luxury of time -- making a passing comment about how hard they have it, to get the shackles up of working mothers everywhere.In case you have been asleep for the past few days and missed the furor, this is how it happened.Paltrow gave an interview to E! recently, where she was sharing how challenging it was for her working on movie sets, and the difficulty of managing being a working actress with being a Mom.""It's much harder for me,"" she said. ""I feel like I set it up in a way that makes it difficult because ... for me, like if I miss a school run, they are like, 'Where were you?' I don't like to be the lead so I don't (have) to work every day, you know, I have little things that I like and obviously I want it to be good and challenging and interesting, and be with good people and that kind of thing.""Not too bad so far. But then the part that so many have gone crazy over:""I think it's different when you have an office job, because it's routine and, you know, you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening,"" said Paltrow. ""When you're shooting a movie, they're like, 'We need you to go to Wisconsin for two weeks,' and then you work 14 hours a day and that part of it is very difficult. I think to have a regular job and be a mom is not as, of course there are challenges, but it's not like being on set.""The response to this has been as you would expect. Scorching. The most scathing response came in the form of an open letter from The New York Post features editor Mackenzie Dawson. Dawson literally went to town on Paltrow which elicited so many comments that she also wrote a follow up.Paltrow is nothing if not polarizing. And she is not new to the controversy her seemingly innocent statements can make and how they can get people frothing and fuming. From her ""I'm not perfect"" statements, to being named the world's most beautiful woman, she seems to have a way of getting under people's skin, especially other working mothers, that puts her in a league all of her own.But here's the thing. This is not so much about Paltrow. It's about the never ending mommy wars and the endless need for women to compare themselves, throw barraging comments at each other and defend their position about who has it worst. Stay-at-home moms against go-to-work moms; women against men; and perhaps the easiest to get all pent up over, ""normal"" moms against the celebrity set.I am not going to bash Paltrow and I'm not going to say that I agree with Dawson's response either. Neither gets us anywhere. I would rather focus on a more constructive dialogue. As I wrote in my book Getting Real About Having It All, it's time we stop comparing ourselves and judging ourselves against what everyone else thinks is the ""right way"" to live our lives, make our income and manage our kids. So far beyond time one would think. The only important thing is that we create the life we want to live, and we live it well. On our own terms. That doesn't always mean that it is easy. I get that. I worked 14 plus hour days for more than a decade. I've been a single parent for longer than that. I have also lost sleep over mortgage payments and school fees and been stressed and overworked to the point of burnout. It's not always rainbows and butterflies.But it is time that we focus on ourselves, what we want to create for ourselves, and care less about the inane comments made my someone who perhaps should know better, but it is likely doing the best she can.I like Gwyneth Paltrow. Do I always like the comments she makes that can make her seem like she is out of touch with the ""real world""? No, I don't. But let's face it. She doesn't live in the ""real world."" She has a very different and rarified existence to most of us. And there's nothing wrong with that. The only thing that is wrong is when we project our frustration and dissatisfaction onto her, or to anyone else, instead of creating something different for ourselves. Could she be a little more aware of how tough it can be out there working the ""9-to-5""? Sure she could. But let's not hold our breath. And let's not waste our time or energy on wishing it would be so.Enough already. Let's leave Paltrow and her choices and comments where they belong -- in the 24 hours news cycle -- and move on to something much more important. Living our own lives."
