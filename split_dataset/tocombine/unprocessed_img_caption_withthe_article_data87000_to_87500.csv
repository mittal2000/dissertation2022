Born in San Diego, Geist always knew he wanted to be in New York City, the place where his inspirations -- George Gershwin, Cole Porter and Rogers and Hart -- created their timeless music. He lived his dream, playing piano in many Broadway shows, including Cats, Wicked, Les Miserables and the original production of Passion. For many, the satisfaction of working steadily on Broadway would be enough, but Geist knew there was more to his story. Ten years ago, he packed his bags and headed west to the hills of New Mexico. He was quickly embraced by the community, and Pranzo, the local Italian restaurant, teamed up with him to open Pranzo's Geist Cabaret. Earlier this year The Santa Fean named him one of Santa Fe's top 25 favorite residents. It's no wonder he feels completely at home. ""I've talked to a lot of musicians who are in New York, and they ask me, 'What keeps you in New Mexico?' I feel very appreciated here. That's a huge part,"" Geist said. ""I felt appreciated in New York, but when you're in an orchestra pit you're pretty much playing for your fellow musicians; you're not playing for an audience. I felt removed in New York. Here I'm engaging with an audience.""Recently, Geist released his second CD titled Inside the Flame, a collection of original compositions. He describes his music as contemporary classical with theater and pop sensibilities. The flame is the creative spark, and with this CD he feels closer than ever with his creative energy. He's also at peace. If he could go back and talk to his younger self, he told me he'd say: ""What we think is so important doesn't really matter. Helping others is the only thing that does."" From his home in New Mexico, Geist spoke about his journey and how he got to the place where he knew it was time to reinvent himself and create a new life. What has been one of the greatest lessons you've learned from moving to New Mexico from New York?You don't have to live in a major city to do your art well and have a fulfilling life.Why New Mexico?Think Georgia O'Keeffe. I relate to her story. I lived in the city. Then something pulled me to the mountains of New Mexico. It was like my art and my spirit were telling me that it was time to leave. I felt like I had done everything I had wanted to do in New York. I played in the orchestra pit for many shows. I conducted. I was totally immersed in the world of theater music. I felt like I had absorbed it and could now offer it to the world. I can sort of be the ambassador of theater music to wherever I wanted to move. Over the years, how have you seen yourself grow mentally and emotionally?Since living in New Mexico and running a cabaret room, I've been more engaged with the public, learning about their tastes and preferences. It's made me more aware of being part of a community that looks to you for artistic direction, which I love. With that comes responsibility. When I first moved to New Mexico from New York, it wasn't so much about demonstrating my talent, but inviting people into my world. I knew I was musical. I knew I could compose. I knew I had this crazy ability to catalog The Great American Songbook, but I needed to share these gifts with others. I grew mentally and emotionally by allowing people to know me more, to listen to my music and to understand me.What advice would you give to others who are thinking of making changes in their lives?Cut the cord! Don't have one foot in one reality and one foot in another. You'll know when you hit your wall, and that is the time to make your move.When did you first realize you had a gift for music?My mother could have been a professional theater actress. She was one of those '50s housewives. She gave her love for theater and music to me. My dad had very good taste in music, as well. I had this record collection of Annie Get Your Gun, My Fair Lady and Rhapsody in Blue. Theater was always in my bones, so going to New York was just a logical step. Growing up I was into classic rock bands.Yes, I read once that you said growing up you wanted to be a cross between Marvin Hamlisch and Steven Tyler. Is there this rock side of you that just wants to come out?There is! There is a camp rock and roller guy in me. I love rock musicals. Do you have any secrets or tips on how to keep a youthful spirit and excited about life?Certainly, my meditation practice has helped me make decisions from a clearer place, which in turn has helped me conserve my energy for the things that are most to important to me: art, community, family and friends. Keeping a ""beginner's mind"" in all my relationships and in my music is also key. I like sharing what I know and as a result, mentoring and teaching is a big part of my life. Giving back, being open and accepting others and staying curious maintain a youthful spirit.Where do you see yourself in five years?I see myself as expanding more in New Mexico, but I would like to do concerts globally. I want to bring my music and The Great American Songbook to a wider audience, both nationally and internationally.After everything you've accomplished, what are you the most proud of?Art is like your child.

4,GOOD NEWS,Choosing Hope: A Visit to Alamo Navajo Reservation,"Charles Orgbon III, ContributorStudent, The University of Georgia; CEO, Greening Forward",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/choosing-hope-a-visit-to-_b_7523442.html,"Even when it appears that we do not have any choices, we still have choices. We always have choices. Many students - many adults, even - do not even realize that so many more choices exist.",2015-06-08,2015-06-05-1433547237-2647129-10497311_10206894437064597_6597702294834637586_o.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-05-1433547237-2647129-10497311_10206894437064597_6597702294834637586_o-thumb.jpg,"Choose the choice that offers the most choices. Taken directly from my speech to Turner Community Youth Development Initiative projects (presented by the Turner Foundation) who had gathered at Honey Lake Plantation for a Youth Summit near Tallahassee, Florida, these aforementioned words ignited three students in particular. These three students - Daryl, Hannah, and Tierra - from Alamo Navajo Reservation near Magdalena, New Mexico were inspired to create a student club called C. H. O. I. C. E. Club (or Community Helping Others Inspire Change Everywhere).When I present to students about finding their voice and unleashing their passion, I am often asked, ""What keeps you going?"" With youth like these from Alamo Navajo Reservation as an example, the answer is clear: the impact of working with young people is meaningful and direct. Knowing that my message created palpable impact energizes me; it feeds me. So, when I heard that the students had actually accepted my challenge to choose to be a leader, to choose to be a person of a character, and to choose to be a changemaker, I knew I had to visit them in New Mexico just to follow-up on their efforts.The nearest international airport to Alamo Navajo Reservation stands in Albuquerque, where direct flights anywhere are still difficult to find. With creosote, salt bush, and plenty of cattle to our sides, a 75 speed limit guides us southward on I-25 and westward on a New Mexican highway towards the nearest incorporated town outside of Alamo Navajo Reservation, Magdalena. Here, the gas station's shelves are empty, and even the pumps yellow plastic bags cover the pumps. The gas menu still boasts $1.99 gas, which could have been months ago that gas was actually that low.Making a sharp turn, we continued 20 miles towards Alamo Navajo Reservation on a road that would have been unpaved in 1986, and 9 miles farther into a community that did not receive cell phone service until 2012, and electricity until 1987. Along the route, mountains paint the sky with celestial beauty, clouds hung over the desert like snails, and cool breezes tugged at our shirts.I walked into the school and Michael Torres, Alamo Community School's media specialist, greeted me with open arms and a firm handshake. After having taught middle school for 10 years, the Soccoro, New Mexico native made the move out to Alamo to pursue a new opportunity to restructure the school's library. Mr. Torres has been teaching at Alamo for five years, so he has seen about 18 high school graduates a year, but he is still the awaiting the year when one of his former students makes it beyond the first year of college. Unable to handle the culture shock and pure isolation, 78 teachers have walked in and out of the doors of Alamo Community School during Mr. Torres's time there alone.Together, Mr. Torres and I, walked into a class full of journalism students, and I was asked to share my personal story of founding Greening Forward when I was 12-years-old. I reminded the students that they, too, could lead community change even as young students. On a scale of 1-10, I asked the students to get up and move to a particular side of the room depending on how they felt about the statement: ""My voice matters."" All of the students stood to the wall, indicating 1, also meaning that all students thought their voice mattered very little. Some even wondered if 0 was an option. To them, it is easy to feel hopeless in a place like Alamo, where there are few examples of success and where they believe that there are no other options. What do we do when we have few choices to choose from?Even when it appears that we do not have any choices, we still have choices. We always have choices. Many students - many adults, even - do not even realize that so many more choices exist. In fact, Tierra, Daryl, and Hannah, had to travel a full day via car, plane, and shuttle to Honey Lake Plantation with the Turner Foundation just to realize that they could make a difference back at Alamo. Since our time at the Youth Summit at Honey Lake Plantation, the students asked the school if they would like a music class, and the school responded favorably. So, the students presented a plan to the school board, and now Alamo Community School will begin offering music classes. After this campaign, the students realized how much influence they had, and they are excited to suggest more ideas. I am excited to see what choices they will take next, because it will always be my choice to support them."

Perhaps you've heard about their efforts or even saw them roll through your area. Their aim is noble. Their journey proved to be more difficult than envisioned.They endured a tragedy halfway through.And a near tragedy at the start.And all that is on top of the devastating episode that birthed this whole thing.The ride is called Heart Across America. It's the brainchild of Sean Maloney, a former Intel executive who overcame a debilitating stroke to resume his life and career. Since beating those odds, Maloney set his sights even higher, taking on heart disease and stroke. He figured a 5,000-mile, three-month bicycle ride from Palo Alto, California, to New York City would be a great way to raise money and spread awareness.Riders will reach the finish line Sunday, proudly knowing the event met many of its goals. It wasn't easy -- tougher than anyone expected.Then again, so is Maloney. ***Maloney rose from a free-spirited youth in London to a leading man in Silicon Valley. At 54, he was widely considered next in line to become the CEO of Intel.Maloney brought the same full-throttle approach to his life away from work. While he loved running and skiing, his real passion was rowing. He could be found most mornings pushing and pulling his boat across the San Francisco Bay.His world came crashing down on Feb. 22, 2010, when blood stopped flowing to the left side of his brain. It was a stroke, triggered by a clot in his left carotid artery.By the time doctors got the blood flowing again, the part of the brain that controlled his speech was ruined. His right arm and leg hung limp, potentially sidelining him forever from his beloved physical activities.***Maloney is one of those people who takes what he's not supposed to be able to do and turns it into a goal. Or, rather, a checkpoint on his way to a goal that's another step or two beyond that. So it was only natural that he took that approach to his stroke recovery. Run around the block? Of course he'd be doing that again.Run a company? Yeah, he'd be doing that, too.Maloney steeled himself with this thought: ""Tomorrow is going to be better than today. Next month is going to be better than last month. The next six months will be better than the last six months.""His loved ones probably knew that's what he was thinking. If not, they picked up on it quickly. Like the time a doctor at a rehab facility thought Maloney was overdoing it and helped him to his room, encouraging him to rest instead. Maloney just looked at him and laughed. And laughed and laughed.The day Maloney left the hospital, a doctor told his wife, Margaret, that Maloney's rowing days were done. Yet on the drive home, Maloney had her drive to his rowing club. He somehow got his scull into the water and climbed board. Using only his left arm, he coerced the boat into action. OK, so it only went in circles. Still, being in motion was both symbolic and a starting point.His ability to communicate followed a similar path. Teaching himself to talk again by using the other side of his brain, Maloney advanced from grunts of ""yes"" and ""no"" to longer phrases. Even full conversations.***Maloney resumed his career within a year. Soon after, he took on a new challenge: running Intel's $7 billion enterprise in China. After growing it to $8 billion in annual revenue, he retired in 2013.But a guy like Maloney doesn't just ride off into the sunset. He finds new challenges. And his new passion became awareness and research benefiting heart disease (the No. 1 killer of Americans) and stroke (the No. 5 killer).He put out a wonderful video titled ""Anatomy of a Comeback: The Sean Maloney Story."" He also became involved with the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, the nation's largest cardiovascular health organization. Last year, he became chairman of the board of directors for the AHA/ASA in the Silicon Valley.Last October -- on World Stroke Day -- Maloney announced the plans for Heart Across America. In a promotional video, he said: ""Coming back from my stroke was the hardest thing I've ever done. And I fully expect this ride to be the second-hardest. But if it can save just one family from going through the trauma of stroke or heart attacks, it will be worth every mile."" ***There's an interesting bit of trivia behind this event: Maloney wasn't a rider.However, seeing as it is impossible to row across the country, a bike seemed like the way to go.Maloney threw himself into cycling and fell in love with everything about it, from the camaraderie among riders to the views from mountaintops.His team shoved off on March 22, heading south from Palo Alto. They cruised through Carmel, lolled through Los Angeles traffic and made their way beyond San Diego. As the terrain climbed and fell, so did the size of their pack, with supporters joining for anywhere from a few miles to a few days.On April 6, the 15th day of the trek, Maloney buzzed with the thrill of leading his pack of riders down a steep, rocky road. Adrenalin and terrain propelled him.He was cruising along at 32 mph when he hit a bump. The crash left him with a broken left hip, three broken ribs, a crushed bicycle helmet, and a variety of cuts and bruises. He was airlifted to a hospital in San Diego, about 100 miles away.Heart Across America continued a few days later, with mainstays David Fisch and Don Brennen accompanied by a new rider: the police officer who rescued Maloney. He joined for about 30 miles, honoring his new friend and relatives killed by heart disease.The pack swept eastward, reaching the Dallas area on April 24. It was a giddy time because the next day Maloney was flying in to rejoin the team.The joy quickly turned to sorrow. Brennen was found dead in his hotel room bed, having apparently died in his sleep. After discussing whether to continue, Maloney and Fisch (Brennen's brother-in-law) came to the same conclusion they reached after Maloney crashed: There's a greater good to be served by continuing to spread their message.""Don would've said, 'Keep on going,'"" Maloney said two days later, during a visit to the national headquarters of the American Heart Association in Dallas. ""Dave is strong. I listened to him. The show must go on."" The route for Heart Across America***Upon his return, Maloney shifted into the role of support staff.Doctors made him promise to stay off a bike for three months, and he has. Well, mostly. He did do a ceremonial ride using a handcycle at an Austin event with Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell. The ride has since visited Houston, Nashville, Chicago and, this past weekend, Pittsburgh. On Sunday, the final legs will roll from Samsung headquarters in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, to Riverbank State Park to Manhattan, then to the finish line at 34th Street and 9th Ave. While the long journey will soon be done, its impact will long be felt. Heart Across America has raised more than $332,000 to fight heart disease and stroke. And there's no telling how many people have learned about warning signs and thought about their risks based on meeting Maloney or learning about his efforts. His core message is the fact that nearly 800,000 Americans die every year due to heart disease and stroke, and nearly 80 percent of all strokes and heart attacks are preventable. Thus, the real triumph of Maloney's effort is the lives saved and improved... including his own.""I'm 58 years of age, and I'd like to think I've got another 20 or 25 years to go,"" Maloney said during the build-up to the event. ""If you give up, you're doomed. As a stroke survivor, if I give up, I'm doomed. I've got to pick myself up off the ground and go for it."" Maloney and his wife, Margaret"

In a promotional video, he said: ""Coming back from my stroke was the hardest thing I've ever done. And I fully expect this ride to be the second-hardest. But if it can save just one family from going through the trauma of stroke or heart attacks, it will be worth every mile."" ***There's an interesting bit of trivia behind this event: Maloney wasn't a rider.However, seeing as it is impossible to row across the country, a bike seemed like the way to go.Maloney threw himself into cycling and fell in love with everything about it, from the camaraderie among riders to the views from mountaintops.His team shoved off on March 22, heading south from Palo Alto. They cruised through Carmel, lolled through Los Angeles traffic and made their way beyond San Diego. As the terrain climbed and fell, so did the size of their pack, with supporters joining for anywhere from a few miles to a few days.On April 6, the 15th day of the trek, Maloney buzzed with the thrill of leading his pack of riders down a steep, rocky road. Adrenalin and terrain propelled him.He was cruising along at 32 mph when he hit a bump. The crash left him with a broken left hip, three broken ribs, a crushed bicycle helmet, and a variety of cuts and bruises. He was airlifted to a hospital in San Diego, about 100 miles away.Heart Across America continued a few days later, with mainstays David Fisch and Don Brennen accompanied by a new rider: the police officer who rescued Maloney. He joined for about 30 miles, honoring his new friend and relatives killed by heart disease.The pack swept eastward, reaching the Dallas area on April 24. It was a giddy time because the next day Maloney was flying in to rejoin the team.The joy quickly turned to sorrow. Brennen was found dead in his hotel room bed, having apparently died in his sleep. After discussing whether to continue, Maloney and Fisch (Brennen's brother-in-law) came to the same conclusion they reached after Maloney crashed: There's a greater good to be served by continuing to spread their message.""Don would've said, 'Keep on going,'"" Maloney said two days later, during a visit to the national headquarters of the American Heart Association in Dallas. ""Dave is strong. I listened to him. The show must go on."" The route for Heart Across America***Upon his return, Maloney shifted into the role of support staff.Doctors made him promise to stay off a bike for three months, and he has. Well, mostly. He did do a ceremonial ride using a handcycle at an Austin event with Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell. The ride has since visited Houston, Nashville, Chicago and, this past weekend, Pittsburgh. On Sunday, the final legs will roll from Samsung headquarters in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, to Riverbank State Park to Manhattan, then to the finish line at 34th Street and 9th Ave. While the long journey will soon be done, its impact will long be felt. Heart Across America has raised more than $332,000 to fight heart disease and stroke. And there's no telling how many people have learned about warning signs and thought about their risks based on meeting Maloney or learning about his efforts. His core message is the fact that nearly 800,000 Americans die every year due to heart disease and stroke, and nearly 80 percent of all strokes and heart attacks are preventable. Thus, the real triumph of Maloney's effort is the lives saved and improved... including his own.""I'm 58 years of age, and I'd like to think I've got another 20 or 25 years to go,"" Maloney said during the build-up to the event. ""If you give up, you're doomed. As a stroke survivor, if I give up, I'm doomed. I've got to pick myself up off the ground and go for it."" Maloney and his wife, Margaret"

Photo: Alan Shaffer.In her latest body of work, the curious and expansive series Mercury, painter Susan Lizotte both mines and mimics history to construct a poignant and eccentric allegory for the present day. She marries a haute-naif aesthetic of thick lines, blocky color, proto-Cubist mannerism, and collapsed perspective with a visual lexicon of knights errants and dogged explorers, sea monsters and tall ships, architectural ruins and sketchy outlines of uncharted territories. All of which serves to reconstruct an alternative narrative of the New World and certain rather salacious and cynical, yet consistently under-reported, consequences of its ""discovery"" for the Old World -- and how those forces and effects continue to shape the world today. Ultimately an indictment of power and its abuses, Mercury traces the roots of medical, industrial, environmental, and commercial misbehavior that have been shaping life on earth for 500 years and counting. And it uses art history to do it. Susan Lizotte: Three Primaries (2015, oil on canvas, 30 x 48 inches). Photo: Alan Shaffer.In both style and content, Lizotte's modern Medievalism prefigures a new dark age, as the 16th century dawns anew at the start of the 21st. Her striking, emotional rendering of both figure and ground wavers between her premise's representational imperatives and a gravitational pull toward abstraction that fittingly has more in common with Pre-Raphaelite awkwardness than contemporary gestural expression. Her tertiary palette also seems culled from another era, one of parchment and velvet, sea foam and starry skies. Although Lizotte engages this art historical motif to depict geopolitical events from the same era her pointed content references, this gestalt is punctuated by compositional incursions large and small in the form of splashes of neon color, faintly pulsing grids in a dusky sky, and outright anachronisms like spray paint and text that slam into the present day at crucial moments, injecting both chemical clarity and disorienting ambiguity into the conversation.

Mercury in ancient mythology was the messenger god, conduit to the underworld, patron of thieves and commerce. It is also a metallic element that is beautiful and poisonous, widely used in early modern medicine, until its nefarious properties were observed. After that it was still used -- just mostly on the unsuspecting. In Lizotte's project, she focuses on its use in Europe after 1500, specifically to treat the particularly virulent strain of syphilis that Columbus and those who came after him managed to bring back to Europe along with their treasure and appetite for glory. This story of karma, irony, disease, greed, racism, fear, technology, and government overreach took place in an age where magic still held sway but humans were increasingly looking to science for answers. In regarding this particular chapter of ancient history, Lizotte cannot help but see the world around her now. Far East, Near East, Middle East. Colonialism, conquest, hubris. Church, state, commerce. Environment, industry, religion. Mercury is a story that continues to unfold across centuries of Western history, its players perennially locked in an intercontinental Game of Thrones complete with kings, pawns, dragons, sex, death, and pirate gold.

(Photo by Carsten Koall/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14f49260000530070a999.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ATHENS -- On September 6, 1946 U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes traveled to Stuttgart to deliver his historic ""Speech of Hope."" Byrnes' address marked America's post-war change of heart vis-à-vis Germany and gave a fallen nation a chance to imagine recovery, growth and a return to normalcy. Seven decades later, it is my country, Greece, that needs such a chance.Until Byrnes' ""Speech of Hope,"" the Allies were committed to converting ""...Germany into a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in character."" That was the express intention of the Morgenthau Plan, devised by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. and co-signed by the United States and Britain two years earlier, in September 1944.Indeed, when the U.S., the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom signed the Potsdam Agreement in August 1945, they agreed on the ""reduction or destruction of all civilian heavy-industry with war potential"" and on ""restructuring the German economy toward agriculture and light industry."" By 1946, the Allies had reduced Germany's steel output to 75 percent of its pre-war level. Car production plummeted to around 10 percent of pre-war output. By the end of the decade, 706 industrial plants were destroyed.Byrnes' speech signaled to the German people a reversal of that punitive de-industrialization drive. Of course, Germany owes its post-war recovery and wealth to its people and their hard work, innovation and devotion to a united, democratic Europe. But Germans could not have staged their magnificent post-war renaissance without the support signified by the ""Speech of Hope.""Prior to Byrnes' speech, and for a while afterwards, America's allies were not keen to restore hope to the defeated Germans. But once President Harry Truman's administration decided to rehabilitate Germany, there was no turning back. Its rebirth was underway, facilitated by the Marshall Plan, the U.S.-sponsored 1953 debt write-down, and by the infusion of migrant labor from Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece.Europe could not have united in peace and democracy without that sea change. Someone had to put aside moralistic objections and look dispassionately at a country locked in a set of circumstances that would only reproduce discord and fragmentation across the continent. The U.S., having emerged from the war as the only creditor country, did precisely that.Today, it is my country that is locked in such circumstances and in need of hope. Moralistic objections to helping Greece abound, denying its people a shot at achieving their own renaissance. Greater austerity is being demanded from an economy that is on its knees, owing to the heftiest dose of austerity any country has ever had to endure in peacetime. No offer of debt relief. No plan for boosting investment. And certainly, as of yet, no ""Speech of Hope"" for this fallen people.It is the mark of ancient societies, like those of Germany and of Greece, that contemporary tribulations revive old fears and foment new discord. So we must be careful. Teenagers should never be told that, due to some ""prodigal sin,"" they deserve to be educated in cash-strapped schools and weighed down by mass unemployment, whether the scene is Germany in the late 1940s or Greece today.As I write these lines, the Greek government is presenting the European Union with a set of proposals for deep reforms, debt management and an investment plan to kick start the economy. Greece is indeed ready and willing to enter into a compact with Europe that will eliminate the deformities that caused it to be the first domino to fall in 2010.But, if Greece is to implement these reforms successfully, its citizens need a missing ingredient: Hope. A ""Speech of Hope"" for Greece would make all the difference now -- not only for us, but also for our creditors, as our renaissance would terminate the default risk.What should such a declaration include? Just as Byrnes' address was short on detail but long on symbolism, a ""Speech of Hope"" for Greece does not have to be technical. It should simply mark a sea change, a break with the past five years of adding new loans on top of already unsustainable debt, conditional on further doses of punitive austerity.Who should deliver it? In my mind, the speaker should be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, addressing an audience in Athens or Thessaloniki or any Greek city of her choice. She could use the opportunity to hint at a new approach to European integration, one that starts in the country that has suffered the most, a victim both of the eurozone's faulty monetary design and of its society's own failings.Hope was a force for good in post-war Europe, and it can be a force for positive transformation now. A speech by Germany's leader in a Greek city could go a long way toward delivering it.© Project Syndicate"

The Chronicle released its annual database of the salaries of public college chief executives Sunday night. The new list shows that two presidents made over $1 million in 2014, and 66 others made more than the Obamas' 2014 income of $495,964. High salaries for college presidents have been a source of controversy in recent years as students have increasingly taken on large amounts of debt to get a degree. One study last year found a correlation between highly paid presidents at state universities and larger student debt loads.President Rodney A. Erickson at Pennsylvania State University made a total of $1,494,603 last year, and Texas A&M University President R. Bowen Loftin collected $1,128,957, according to the Chronicle. Erickson and Loftin both left their positions in 2014. That tally of two millionaires -- Erickson and Loftin -- is considerably lower than in 2013, when nine presidents made over $1 million. Many of those presidents have since left their respective schools. Hamid Shirvani at the North Dakota University System was the third highest paid person on 2013's list when he left the school, and Larry C. Skogen, the current interim chancellor, was compensated $182,520 in 2014. The top-paid president in 2013 was E. Gordon Gee at Ohio State University, who got a $6 million package as he left the school. Penn State confirmed to HuffPost that Erickson's compensation includes ""payout due to his retirement from the University after more than 37 years of service."" He received $125,000 for unused vacation and sick days and $150,000 as a performance bonus approved by the board of trustees.

Fenves chose to take a $750,000 base salary instead -- which is still higher than the Obamas' total income.Even leaving bonuses aside, school presidents' pay often represents a huge amount of money. Erickson's 2014 pay is equivalent to the tuition of about 88 students. At the University of South Florida, President Judy L.

Kantor’s net worth is about $2.4 billion, according to Forbes.In a joint article published June 4 in The Times of London, Blair and Kantor said ECTR wants to reach thousands of students across Europe over the next two years, working for racial and religious tolerance.They said: “It is our firm belief that it is not religion or faith that causes or foments conflict.

A photo editor views the July cover of Vanity Fair featuring Caitlyn Jenner on June 1, 2015 in Westwood, California. Formerly known as Bruce Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner is an Olympic atlete who came out publicly as transgender in a televised interview with Diane Sawyer. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafdce5250000940037fdc1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The impact of Jenner's debut has been nothing short of extraordinary. Media outlets that struggled to properly report on trans persons in police blotters just a few years ago are suddenly interested in the topic. ""Ex-trans persons,"" those few scattered across the country over many years, suddenly become resurrected. Christians of all stripes begin to weigh in directly, not simply flinging afterthoughts to their decades-long homophobia.I'd like to address the response of the Christian conservatives. I had found it tantalizing during my years of advocacy in Maryland that some of those most opposed to gay rights and marriage equality were either supportive of trans persons or, at worst, apathetic. They wouldn't support gender identity legislation, so as not to break with their anti-gay team which found the distinctions between and trans confusing, and thereby dangerous to consistency of message, but seeing trans as a medical condition they were surprisingly sympathetic.Today, post-Jenner, with the surrender of many religious conservatives on the impending ""redefinition of marriage,"" they can no longer afford to treat trans persons as afterthoughts. We must be attacked head-on theologically. That, however, is proving to be rather difficult. The most notorious transphobic person, the Catholic Professor Paul McHugh, a decade ago accepted the reality of gender identity when his Hopkins colleague, Bill Reiner, proved its existence scientifically. While he still sees trans women as mentally ill, because he can't unravel gender identity from sexual orientation, he's been left behind by his fellow psychiatric colleagues who long ago, with few exceptions, gave up any religious underpinning to issues of sex and gender. The article referenced above with his most recent rant (pity poor Johns Hopkins University which can't get this guy to stop from embarrassing them) actually had the temerity to state that "" there are scientists who disagree,"" as if there are today more than a handful. McHugh is a classic example of a professor in over his head -- a psychiatrist who doesn't understand the basics of human sexuality recognized by all professional medical organizations, including the World Health Organization, and a Catholic fundamentalist who seems to have never studied ancient texts.An American Catholic theologian, Salvatore Cordileone, the Archbishop of San Francisco, sums up his critique of transsexualism by stating, categorically, ""The clear biological fact is that a human being is born either male or female. ""End of story. However, there are traditions in ancient Biblical culture (Midrash Bereshit Rabbah 8:1) that had the first being as an intersex person, an hermaphrodite.The Rabbis of 2000 years ago recognized six types of sex among humans -- female, male, androgynous, tum tum, aylonit and saris -- and the Torah (Isaiah 56:4-5), as well as later Christian Scripture, recognized eunuchs (saris, many of whom were either intersex or trans women) as a higher form of humanity. It's very hard to pin your entire catalog of disapproval on one sentence in Deuteronomy, and those efforts pale in comparison to the concoction of millennia of homophobia rooted in one sentence in Leviticus. So why this resistance? Even Biblical literalists must recognize there are many passages which conflict with the absolute pronouncements of a Cordileone or McHugh, who, by the way, was responsible for the Vatican's pronouncement back when it was run by the right-wing Benedict. When they get down to it, they always revert to a view of biological sex as rooted in genitalia. But, as I've pointed out, religious authorities (and the Greeks before them) have for millennia recognized that sexual anatomy and physiology are not that simple. This belief, that genitals = sex, has been so deeply rooted in society that intersex babies have been left to die or ""converted"" into vagina-bearing beings raised as girls once the surgical techniques allowed the condition of ambiguous genitalia to be resolved to the wishes of the parents. When modern medicine routinely considered the birth of an intersex infant to be a pediatric emergency, and hid the follow-up care in silence and obfuscation, it's no wonder that the average individual can't comprehend that we have minds that are sexed to the degree where we know what sex we are, irrespective of our genital anatomy. There are millions of intersex individuals whose chromosomes and genes don't match their genitalia or whose genitals are ambiguous, and it seems clear that if they would only come out as gay and trans persons have over the past few decades, society would have a hard time ignoring the complexity of human sexuality.It's one thing to deny the embodied brain and its manifestation in a subjective feeling of gender identity, because that is a function of a theory of mind that as yet has few tangible physical manifestations. People's difficulties coming to grips with all sorts of brain conditions and their mental and emotional manifestations makes that abundantly clear. But when presented with live humans with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome or 5'-alpha reductase deficiency, it become impossible, short of a categorical denial of reality, to ignore the scientific evidence. Church leaders have been allowed for too long to evade the medical evidence.Southern Baptists who talk of trans persons ""rejecting your gender"" misread the fact that trans people are doing the exact opposite - embracing their gender and their sex as embodied in their brains. Russell Moore, the head of the ethics arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, said, ""The cultural narrative behind the transgender turn ... is rooted in the ancient heresy of Gnosticism, with the idea that the 'real' self is separate from who one is as an embodied, material being."" Aside from the fact that few people care about ""ancient heresies"" in general or Gnosticism in particular, the core of the trans experience is indeed rooted in ""an embodied, material being."" Just not in the overvalued genitals but in the undervalued brain.At times, it hard for me to accept that some men of religious persuasions are so intent to circle the wagons to maintain their hegemony and control over their womenfolk, and so afraid of a few hundred thousand trans women who are comfortable with being rid of an appendage that developed in opposition to their brain (because, if you bother to check, human sexual development in utero is a complex dance with many moves and, therefore, many outcomes). Acceptance of the trans experience will not lead to millions undergoing gender transition, just as the growth of same-sex marriage has not led to the catastrophic disappearance of opposite-sex marriage. If it's led to anything novel, beyond the bourgeoisification of the gay experience, it's the growth in gay divorces. The Christian community is the victim of its 40-year tradition of equating every natural disaster with gay behavior, and imagining the worst possible outcome to every possible situation. Maybe that tradition derives from the Revelation stories, and so has a long and venerable history, but it's a lousy way to live. Especially when it means driving your children to suicide or being in a state of high anxiety every time you enter a public bathroom.I will take issue with Emma Green's closing comment in The Atlantic piece: ""The adjustment period on this issue will be complicated. And as the response to Caitlyn Jenner has shown, it's only just beginning."" The adjustment period is at times complicated, but it has been going full throttle for the past 15 years. While few have been paying attention, science and medicine, academia, corporate America, the federal government, almost half of the state governments, and over 200 municipalities, many of which exist in red states, have been adjusting and doing so successfully. Cait Jenner just lifted the lid off the volcano; the pioneers have been at work for decades, and thanks to seemingly endless supplies of courage, tenacious advocacy and education, often against strong resistance and heavy odds, have made Jenner's transition possible. All that's changed is that now, thanks to Jenner, ""the whole world's watching."""

While the prodigiously talented Pete Seeger was clearly the most noted member of the group (Fred Hellerman and Lee Hays were the other two members), it was Ronnie Gilbert who gave the Weavers their lyrical elegance.While Gilbert could be as playful and whimsical as the rest of the gang, her contralto voice projected a haunting solemnity that stood out. Listen to her segment on the Weaver's version of the great Leadbelly song, ""Goodnight, Irene."" Her voice is so achingly ""declarative,"" it's heartbreaking. Wonderful song, terrific singer. (Fun fact: Ken Kesey's book, Sometimes a Great Notion, takes its title from a Goodnight, Irene lyric.) The daughter of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, Gilbert was born and raised in New York City. Her mother was a seamstress (just as the iconic Mary ""Mother Jones"" Harris was) and labor union advocate, and her father was a factory worker. Gilbert once said that it was listening to the ""subversive"" lyrics of Paul Robeson on the radio, when she was a kid, that inspired her to become a folk singer.Anyone conversant in Cold War history and its attendant ""Red Scare,"" is aware of what happened to the Weavers (formed in 1948). Suspecting this folk group of being too ""leftwing,"" the merchants of hatred and fear, led by Senator Joseph McCarthy, smeared them as ""Communists"" and had them blacklisted. Despite their hit songs (Goodnight, Irene, Wimoweh, On Top of Old Smokey, Kisses Sweeter Than Wine, et al), they were banned from appearing on radio or television, and their recording contract with Decca Records was abruptly cancelled. They went from being one of the most popular post-war groups to being almost totally ostracized, all the result of America's ideological ignorance and hypocrisy. Basically, the Weavers were destroyed. The group formally disbanded in 1953. But even with the ruination of her music career, the irrepressible Ronnie Gilbert went on to become a fully committed social activist and organizer, traveling to Cuba, in 1961, and visiting Paris, France, in the turbulent year of 1968. She later earned a master's degree in psychology and became a psychotherapist.When I was a kid, a friend's parents took me to a Pete Seeger concert in Pasadena, California. These people were folk music aficionados, owning records by Odetta, Baez, Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, etc. Of course, by this time the Weavers had long since been dissolved and Seeger was working as a solo performer.During the show (which he performed on a homemade banjo), Seeger made a couple of memorable announcements. The first was addressed to Ronnie Gilbert. Without any explanation or introductory words, he issued a shout-out to her, wishing her ""good luck."" Apparently, she was either recovering from an illness or had been laid low by some personal problem; we had no idea. In any event, at the mention of Ronnie's name, the audience cheered.The second thing Seeger did was remind us that when you write a song, you have no idea where it will wind up, which made it analogous, in his words, to ""raising a child."" He said the next song was one he had written but hadn't bothered to copyright. Still, its success had made him as happy as a ""proud parent."" He then proceeded to sing, ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone?"" (which became a big hit by the Kingston Trio). When the audience heard the opening chords, they cheered wildly.Celebrity activists are to be commended. After all, it would be a lot easier to sit poolside and count their money than to march in a rally or travel to a Third World country and promote a cause. But it's even more impressive when this ""activism"" is done by celebs who aren't millionaires, and is done without fanfare or the expectation of praise. Rest in peace, Ronnie Gilbert. You done good.David Macaray is a playwright and author. His latest book is, Night Shift: 270 Factory Stories."

It was a slap in the face. But I kept going."" It's been an illustrious career, mostly with Agence France-Presse (AFP), the international news agency he joined in September 1989. ""Photojournalism is one the very few jobs that you can't do if you don't like,"" he said. His name is synonymous with AFP.Today he's AFP's photo manager for the Middle East and North Africa, overseeing a phalanx of some 80 photographers from a regional base in Nicosia, Cyprus.In addition to running the shop, he still goes out on occasional assignments, juggles budgets, is in charge of purchasing photo equipment, undertakes photo editing, coordinates his charges' whereabouts, monitors activities and trains photographers - and not only AFP's. Conducting a visual journalism workshop for Yemeni journalists in Sanaa  in 2006 (courtesy Baz)Baz stumbled into it, by default, courtesy of a raging 15-year civil war in Lebanon, during which he'd go out with friends using his father's Contaflex camera to capture battles, scenes of destruction, and some semblance of life in that war-torn country. Baz on a tank in Lebanon in 1986 (by Jack Dabbaghian)It was a far cry from what his parents had hoped he'd become: a doctor, lawyer or engineer. He, in fact, wanted to be a pilot.His first forays were as a freelancer, selling pictures to Paris Match magazine, TIME, Newsweek, Stern, Der Spiegel, L'Express and L'Espresso, to name a few. He doesn't mind being called a war photojournalist.""I've worked and lived in conflict zones for three decades so I guess it does apply to me,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean I only photographed death. No. I kept searching for life in all the conflicts I have covered. And most of my war pictures contain a reference to life.""    Screen shot of Patrick Baz' AFP portfolio A picture dated March 2, 1987 is of French musicians performing amidst the rubble of Beirut's Christian neighborhood of Ain Al Remmaneh along the ""Green Line"" that divided the city at the time.He covered the first Palestinian ""intifada"" (uprising), the Gulf War of 1991, as well as conflicts in Kurdistan, Somalia and Bosnia. Fast forward to conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan where he was embedded with U.S. Marines, many of whom weren't even Americans, he said, noting the generation gap and cultural divide between him and the twenty-somethings whose conversations centered on American football and baseball. ""What readers need to understand is that when a journalist is embedded with a combat unit, he's like a foreign object that is being attached or integrated to your body. It takes time for your body to get used to it and adapt,"" Baz explained. Aside from lugging cameras, lenses, and donning a flak jacket, he also attached a GoPro camera to his helmet to free his hands when the need arose to maneuver in difficult situations.More recently he's done time shooting the Arab revolutions in Egypt and Libya.Today's digital equipment makes it easier taking and deleting unwanted images than being encumbered by rolls of film and other tools of the trade that used to slow the process of transmitting photos around the world.""It is like asking me if it is easier to drive an old Ford T or the latest fully-equipped SUV,"" Baz said, adding that he used to spend all his money on films, developing and printing. A 17-year-old Patrick Baz (courtesy Baz)It's not all battlefields and body parts.Taking pictures is Baz' therapy he says and an ever-present camera is there to capture the most mundane of scenes.

I answered him, 'did you see lots of deranged people in yours?'"" Baz replied sarcastically.There's also been a toll on his 19-year-old daughter. ""Once, I was listening to a news report about a huge car bomb in Iraq while I was driving her to a friend - she was 9 - I heard her tiny voice from the back seat of the car 'I don't want you to go there anymore I don't want you to get killed.' It was a slap in the face. But I kept going."" It's been an illustrious career, mostly with Agence France-Presse (AFP), the international news agency he joined in September 1989. ""Photojournalism is one the very few jobs that you can't do if you don't like,"" he said. His name is synonymous with AFP.Today he's AFP's photo manager for the Middle East and North Africa, overseeing a phalanx of some 80 photographers from a regional base in Nicosia, Cyprus.In addition to running the shop, he still goes out on occasional assignments, juggles budgets, is in charge of purchasing photo equipment, undertakes photo editing, coordinates his charges' whereabouts, monitors activities and trains photographers - and not only AFP's. Conducting a visual journalism workshop for Yemeni journalists in Sanaa  in 2006 (courtesy Baz)Baz stumbled into it, by default, courtesy of a raging 15-year civil war in Lebanon, during which he'd go out with friends using his father's Contaflex camera to capture battles, scenes of destruction, and some semblance of life in that war-torn country. Baz on a tank in Lebanon in 1986 (by Jack Dabbaghian)It was a far cry from what his parents had hoped he'd become: a doctor, lawyer or engineer. He, in fact, wanted to be a pilot.His first forays were as a freelancer, selling pictures to Paris Match magazine, TIME, Newsweek, Stern, Der Spiegel, L'Express and L'Espresso, to name a few. He doesn't mind being called a war photojournalist.""I've worked and lived in conflict zones for three decades so I guess it does apply to me,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean I only photographed death. No. I kept searching for life in all the conflicts I have covered. And most of my war pictures contain a reference to life.""    Screen shot of Patrick Baz' AFP portfolio A picture dated March 2, 1987 is of French musicians performing amidst the rubble of Beirut's Christian neighborhood of Ain Al Remmaneh along the ""Green Line"" that divided the city at the time.He covered the first Palestinian ""intifada"" (uprising), the Gulf War of 1991, as well as conflicts in Kurdistan, Somalia and Bosnia. Fast forward to conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan where he was embedded with U.S. Marines, many of whom weren't even Americans, he said, noting the generation gap and cultural divide between him and the twenty-somethings whose conversations centered on American football and baseball. ""What readers need to understand is that when a journalist is embedded with a combat unit, he's like a foreign object that is being attached or integrated to your body. It takes time for your body to get used to it and adapt,"" Baz explained. Aside from lugging cameras, lenses, and donning a flak jacket, he also attached a GoPro camera to his helmet to free his hands when the need arose to maneuver in difficult situations.More recently he's done time shooting the Arab revolutions in Egypt and Libya.Today's digital equipment makes it easier taking and deleting unwanted images than being encumbered by rolls of film and other tools of the trade that used to slow the process of transmitting photos around the world.""It is like asking me if it is easier to drive an old Ford T or the latest fully-equipped SUV,"" Baz said, adding that he used to spend all his money on films, developing and printing. A 17-year-old Patrick Baz (courtesy Baz)It's not all battlefields and body parts.Taking pictures is Baz' therapy he says and an ever-present camera is there to capture the most mundane of scenes. On a flight from Dubai to Beirut I saw him shooting cloud formations.He posts some of his pictures on Instagram (@patrickbaz) and publishes some on the AFP wire but most end up on his hard disk.
