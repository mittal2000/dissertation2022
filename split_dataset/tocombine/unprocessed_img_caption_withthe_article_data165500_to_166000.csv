(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cbf2c1f0000500021587e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Funky and fascinating New Orleans has seen its share of hard times. After Katrina’s destruction in 2005, may wondered how -- or if -- the city could ever recover. Whole neighborhoods were wiped out and much of the city was submerged. The cost in human life (1,800 killed by the storm) and suffering have been staggering. But NOLA has not given up. More than seven years later, the city has rebuilt many areas and billions of dollars have been pumped into public works and the levee system.It’s true that some things will never be the same; many long-time residents have left, and though some yearn to return, there’s often a question of what they have to come back to. Poverty remains stubbornly high, and there’s an urgent need to reckon with a broken criminal justice system where incarceration is often driven by profit.But there’s lots of buzz about how NOLA is making positive changes. Fresh perspectives have flourished since the storm shook up the status quo. The New Deal-style public works approach to rebuilding (the opposite of austerity!) helped the city weather the recession. Investors and young people are increasingly seeing possibilities.On a recent visit, I talked to residents across the spectrum who shared a new sense of pride in a city that is no longer a symbol of what can go wrong, but of many things that can go right. NOLA is still one of the best places in America to hear music (Preservation Hall and Snug Harbor are still temples of jazz), but here are a few new reasons to visit a city that may well be in the midst of a renaissance.1. The Brain GainBefore Katrina, launching a business or trying to attract interest in a new idea would run you up against exclusive networks that used to wield power in the city. These have been broken up by the storm, and NOLA has seen an entrepreneurial burst hot enough for Forbes to name NOLA “the biggest brain magnet in the country."" Entrepreneurial activity is now 40 times the national average.There has been an influx of college-educated people motivated both by the desire to see their ideas come to life and a yearning to be part of the city’s recovery. The film industry is thriving, with production increasing 175 percent since pre-Katrina days. (If you haven't yet seen Beasts of the Southern Wild by NOLA filmmaker Benh Zeitlinsee, don't wait any longer). NOLA’s Technology Corridor, a 12-mile stretch of interstate featuring the NASA Michoud facility, is expanding, and digital media and bioscience industries are on the rise. What some are calling the “brain gain movement” has brought Teach for America corps members to the city, and a slew of startups related to education have popped up recently (a movement towards privatized education, however, is likely to be counterproductive). According to Reuters, NOLA is committed to turning itself into “Silicon Valley on the Bayou” and giving cities like Austin, Texas a run for their money as a technology hub.2. The WWII MuseumThe WWII Museum is the #1 attraction for NOLA on TripAdvisor, and with good reason. Brimming with artifacts, oral histories and other accounts (audio, written, video), the museum has attracted over 3 million visitors since launching in 2000.I had the pleasure of attending the opening of the U.S. Freedom Pavilion: the Boeing Center on Jan. 12, 2013. Veterans from all over the country were invited and duly applauded for their service, including a spry 86-year-old named Clarence Stirewalt who signed up for the war effort at 16 (he lied about his age) and worked on an attack transport ship in Pearl Harbor. The ceremony included remarks by museum supporter Tom Brokow and Roscoe Brown, a WWII veteran and Tuskegee airman who spoke of how the war served to push racial integration forward. Brokow mentioned that upon returning from the war, black officers were not allowed to enter officer’s clubs in many states -- despite the fact that German officers taken as prisoners of war were allowed to do so! Highlighting the contributions of black veterans was a hopeful step forward for both the country and the city of New Orleans, which has seen more than its share of racial tensions. One bone to pick: there was, to my recollection, only a single mention of the contributions of women during the ceremony, a brief nod by Senator Mary Landrieu.The new center shows off the artillery, tanks and airplanes used in the war, including a reassembled B-17E Flying Fortress named My Gal Sal which is viewed by a breathtaking catwalk. My Gal Sal went down on an icecap in Greenland where the crew struggled to stay alive and signaled for help for 11 days before being rescued. The most exciting interactive feature is Final Mission: USS Tang Submarine Experience, which gives you a taste of what life was like in WWII’s Pacific Theater. The Tang sank 33 ships before it was hit by one of its own missiles on a war patrol. Each exhibit visitor is given a card representing an actual crew member, and you are invited to explore the station manned by that member and perform battle actions as the Tang engages Japanese forces.3. The FoodNew Orleans has fewer people now than before the storm, but interestingly, more restaurants. Some think it’s an even better place to eat today, as newcomers are adding flavors and keeping old-timers on their toes. You can, of course, enjoy the classics, such as the delightfully old-school Grill Room at the historic Windsor Hotel, where you are serenaded by live piano as you enjoy selections from a menu that’s not resting on its laurels like those at some of the other venerable NOLA eateries. For French Quarter people-watching, get yourself a window seat overlooking Bourbon Street at Bourbon House at the Astor Crowne Plaza (a superb and convenient hotel, btw) and let the carnival of life cruise by as you enjoy local seafood (try the oysters).My favorite post-Katrina restaurant has to be Cochon (just a few blocks from the WWII Museum) where celebrated Chef Donald Link works his Cajun magic on pork, seafood and game. Believe me, this man can even turn a dish of cucumbers into something memorable. His dishes are not innovative for the sake of being innovative -- they are innovative for the sake of tasting damn good. Other post-Katrina restaurants to try include Root, a Warehouse District newcomer that uses high-tech gear to create flavorful dishes like tea-smoked chicken, and Apolline, a cozy Creole spot on Magazine Street, where the chef is appreciated for his succulent seafood dishes like sautéd black drum.4. The ParksThe lush vegetation and enchanting outdoor spaces of NOLA are among the most appealing things about the city. Parks were ravaged by Katrina, but happily they have been restored. Louis Armstrong Park, across from the French Quarter, has finally been brought back to life thanks to tireless community activists and city efforts and is once again safe to visit. A new summer music series attracted 50,000 people in its first year, and hopes to grow to twice that size in 2013. The magnificent orchids of the Botanical Garden in New Orleans City Park were nearly wiped out by Katrina, but they are back and were featured in the 2012 Fall Garden Festival.5. The PeopleThe gumbo of cultures, ethnicities and traditions makes New Orleans one of the most fascinating mixes of human beings in America. Folks tend to be warm, enthusiastic about their city and eager to talk to visitors. Everyone I spoke with on my recent visit was eager to sing the praises of post-Katrina rejuvenation, though many acknowledged that not all New Orleanians have benefitted equally from the city’s renaissance. The Lower 9th Ward, a low-income black neighborhood devastated by the storm, still lacks basic facilities like grocery stores.The Lower 9th is rebuilding slowly, and there is much appreciation for the houses built by Brad Pitt’s Make It Right foundation (however odd their styles appear next to more traditional dwellings). Musicians' Village, a new residential area featuring a state-of-the-art music center, was kicked off by Harry Connick Jr. and Branford Marsalis to provide a home for musicians dislocated by the storm.Some Lower 9th residents are irked by buses that bring visitors on tours of the area. If you really want to get to know the locals and do something to help, think of signing up for a “voluntour” program with an outfit like Habitat for Humanity. I did this a few years ago, and I can tell you, if someone with as many thumbs as I have can hang sheetrock, there is hope for anybody. The best part of volunteering is meeting the residents and hearing the stories of how they have coped with unimaginable hardship, and of course, sharing the sense of enjoyment for life that never seems to dissipate no matter what the challenges."

(AP Photo/DAPD Steffi Loos) GERMANY OUT AUSTRIA OUT SWITZERLAND OUT",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cbf1b2100003000c53f3e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dita Von Teese, the personification of modern, classic glamour, has ascended to the forefront of the burlesque revival, serves as a muse to Christian Louboutin, designs vintage-inspired dresses, lingerie, and cosmetics, and is a global ambassador for Cointreau. Recently, she added fragrance purveyor to her resume.In this day of sartorial casualness, Dita stands out. Not interested in blending in, she happily shows the world she enjoys making an effort. She succeeds in looking pulled together for every occasion, and her dedication to an elegant yet sensual retro-inspired style is an inspiration to women around the world.Dita unveiled her first fragrance, Dita Von Teese, in Germany in 2011, and has just introduced it in the U.S., along with her second fragrance, Rouge. Pondering ""what a Helmut Newton photograph would smell like"" and inspired by 1930s photos of women in Parisian nightclubs, they created a seductive, heady concoction of peonies, Bourbon pepper, bergamot, Bulgarian rose, Tahitian Tiaré, jasmine, musk, patchouli, Gaiac wood and sandalwood.I spoke to Dita at the U.S. launch of her two fragrances at Fred Segal in West Hollywood last month. Impeccably attired in a black vintage Thierry Mugler suit, sheer black-dotted hosiery and her trademark sky-high Louboutins, she spoke to and posed with her fans, occasionally breaking away to check on her bids on the Greta Garbo auction taking place in nearby Beverly Hills.How are the two fragrances different from each other? ""Rouge is more ambery, like Lapsang Souchong. It's softer, more sensual. The first one is more powerful and sophisticated, more like my signature. It's womanly.""Sophisticated Dita has no interest in smelling like a little girl. ""I always wanted to be a grownup,"" she shared. ""I don't want to revert to childhood memories or smell like candy or anything like that. I always wanted to be a grownup, and I like to revel in being a woman, so I don't want girlish, powdery, sweet perfumes.""I commented that the fragrances, selling for $30 to $75, are well-priced, particularly considering the quality, and Dita agreed. ""It's a challenge to create a perfume that's successful, but at the same time smells sophisticated. I worked really closely with the noses in Paris. I wanted to make something really great, but still at a low price point.""Wondering what Dita's first fragrances were? ""My first perfume was Love's Baby Soft. Only Americans really know what that is. It still has a special place in my heart. My first grownup perfume that I really loved was Lou Lou by Cacharel. I loved that, and then I wore Quelques Fleurs for many years, which is a very obscure fragrance but I just loved it. It was the first perfume that I really saved up my money for. I bought it when I was 15. I always felt it was important. I wanted something special. I didn't want to smell like my friends or anybody that I knew. Quelques Fleurs is one of the first commercially available perfumes.""Dita's admiration for the glamorous stars from Hollywood's Golden Age is undeniable. ""Betty Grable is one of my favorites. That era of film that she made, the '40s grand Technicolor musicals -- those are films that inspire my shows and my style. She's my number one. I don't look like her, but that film era gets me excited. Anytime Betty Grable and Carmen Miranda are in a film together, for some reason that's one of my favorites. All those films are exotic and set in exotic locales I love. I made a show kind of devoted to one of those recently, a really tropical-themed 40s show.""Which era is this vintage aficionado most influenced by? ""I feel like my look is a combination of so many different things. My hair is kind of a '30s Marcel wave, but '40s length. My eye makeup is very '50s. I like '40s clothes. My look is a combination of many different eras that I really love that's developed into one solid thing."""
2,WELLNESS,Manti Te'o and His Crisis of Character,"Dr. Gregory Jantz , Contributor
Mental Health Expert and Founder of The Center • A Place of HOPE",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/manti-teo_us_5b9cbeabe4b03a1dcc816c90,This is a crisis of character for Manti Te'o.  Scouts around the NFL and people around the country are wondering what Manti Te'o is made of.  They wonder if his judgment and character are as non-existent as Lennay Kekua.  I hope he figures it out and proves them wrong.,2013-01-23,"In a photo provided by ESPN, Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o pauses during an interview with ESPN on Friday, Jan. 18, 2013, in Bradenton, Fla. (AP Photo/ESPN Images, Ryan Jones) MANDATORY CREDIT",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cbeab2500003500363056.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Manti Te'o has gone viral. I'm sure this Heisman trophy contender would much rather his Internet fame was due to exploits on the football field, as a linebacker for Notre Dame. Before a couple of days ago, that was true -- not so much anymore. The Internet has not been kind to this young man, who appears to have been hooked by an Internet catfish scheme. The term ""catfish"" is a fairly recent one, meaning someone who creates a false persona online. The false persona that ensnared Te'o was of a young woman named Lennay Kekua, battling leukemia. This persona came complete with photos, since discovered to belong to 23-year-old Diane O'Meara from Torrance, Calif. Imagine her surprise to find out her image was used in an Internet hoax. According to a relative, the O'Meara family ""found out about it yesterday. They were shocked.""No more shocked than Manti Te'o, who, so the storyline goes, fell in love with some who didn't exist and later was so devastated at her supposed death, it affected his performance on the field. The current favorite for perpetrator of this elaborate hoax is Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, who knew Te'o and was, apparently, a high-school classmate of Diane O'Meara. So much for six degrees of separation. According to news reports, in an interview with ESPN, Te'o ""insisted he had no role in the bizarre hoax involving his 'dead' girlfriend."" No role? He was thick in the middle of the whole thing. There's an old adage that says, ""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."" As the convoluted details of this cautionary tale about the power of make-believe continue to twist and turn, Manti Te'o has a decision to make. He needs to look himself in the mirror and figure out why he was fooled so many times.He needs to figure that out because others are asking the same thing, including NFL scouts, one saying, ""It's obviously a red flag ... There will be a lot of questions of why, and what was to be gained, and what did you learn from this."" If all Manti Te'o learns is that he had ""no role,"" that would be the wrong lesson. Figuring out his role is crucial going forward.Adults get in and stay in relationships for all kinds of reasons. When people have a choice, their choice of relationship says a great deal about who they are and what they need. I think Manti Te'o should figure out why he was so drawn to this relationship in the first place and what it says about him. I can only imagine there were a plethora of red flags about Lennay Kekua. Red flags that were dismissed, covered over or explained away. Lennay Kekua, the person, didn't exist, but Mandi Te'o's need for Lennay Kekua was very real. Discovering the ""why"" behind the need is even more important than figuring out the ""who"" behind the hoax. I hope Manti Te'o figures it out. Up to a few days ago, he gained notoriety because of his prowess, skill and competency. Now his name has become a viral punch line. Te'oing has replaced Tebowing, as the latest Internet meme -- posting pictures of yourself interacting with non-existent people. In April, the San Jose Giants will host a ""Lennay Kekua Night,"" with catfish on the menu and fans encouraged to ""bring their imaginary or real significant others to the game for free."" In May, the Florence Freedom will hold a ""Manti Te'o Girlfriend Bobblehead Night,"" with the first 1,000 fans getting a box with nothing inside.This is a crisis of character for Manti Te'o. Scouts around the NFL and people around the country are wondering what Manti Te'o is made of. They wonder if his judgment and character are as non-existent as Lennay Kekua. I hope he figures it out and proves them wrong."

Was it a pinch of thyme or oregano? When did she add the olive oil to the lentils? Some of the dishes almost bear her culinary signature. But of course none of them taste exactly the same.,2013-01-22,2013-01-20-huffpo-web-prod-www-content-generated-theblog-neneme.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-01-20-huffpo-web-prod-www-content-generated-theblog-neneme.jpg," A special thank you to www.souvlakiforthesoul.com for the photo of the kounoupidi kapama.My first memories of my grandmother's cooking stretch back to when I was barely old enough to reach the kitchen counter. My grandmother had turned the garage in our Riverside home into a makeshift kitchen, complete with an electric stove, box freezer, and work table. Of course we had a kitchen in our house, but one is never enough in a Greek household. The yellow Volkswagen Beetle had been pushed out of its rightful home, which was now overrun with ceramic crocks of homemade tangy Greek yogurt, a hodgepodge of jars filled with freshly cured olives, pots of sweet smelling rizogalo, and tins filled with braided butter cookies called ""koulourakia.""I would spend hours watching her cook. When I got a little older, my yiayia would let me help her in the kitchen. We made bread. We'd shape it like Playdough, pressing and rolling it into little twists and rounds. She'd let me brush the egg on the dough and sprinkle it with sesame. As the bread baked, the kitchen grew warm and the scent of toasting sesame filled the air. This was better than Playdough! Even after I became a chef, we continued to cook together. I would follow along as she doled out instructions. I watched as she roughly chopped onions and carrots into a jumble of non-uniform pieces, and whipped up sauces in an altogether unorthodox manner. She had no formal training. She simply cooked by instinct, and her intuition in the kitchen was spot on. Her Greek village recipes were the foods of my childhood. She browned large chunks of cauliflower in olive oil and then slow cooked them in cinnamon and tomato. She boiled fresh grape leaves and stuffed them with fresh mint and rice; always making a gesture over the pot that was intended to ward off the ""evil eye,"" thus ensuring the dishes success. She never wrote down her recipes and she never measured ingredients. Eventually I began to follow her around the kitchen with measuring cups and spoons, frantically taking notes. My efforts always proved to be in vain. No sooner would I measure an ingredient, dutifully taking my notes; then she would eye the bowl suspiciously, tossing in another handful of flour or a splash of oil. I tried to protest. Inevitably she dismissed my every objection with a wave of the hand and a simple ""it needed a bit more."" But how much, I would ask, is a bit more?  As my grandmother moved into her nineties the dishes I had taken for granted for years became precious commodities. Her pace slowed. She stopped curing her own olives, and required help to knead her bread. Yet she was still always shuffling about the kitchen. When I came to visit her she had an extra pair of hands to help her cook. I gave up on following her around with measuring cups and spoons. I accepted the fact that at some point these recipes might be lost. Regardless, they would never be written down on paper. You could not find them in a cookbook. They could not be measured. They were guided by a hand, history, and years of knowledge. I focused on our time together, making mental notes that I hoped would help me to replicate the dishes when she was no longer able to make them with me. At 97 we finally moved my grandmother out of her house and into assisted living. At first she protested. How could she be without a kitchen? Her need for cooking had long ago extended past the garage. It was an extension of her. My mother decorated her new apartment beautifully. There were activities filling her daily schedule. Greek friends visited, bringing her homemade food. She adjusted to her new life, but her attention soon turned back to cooking. She became friends with the chef that prepared all the food for the dining hall. In no time they were on a first-name basis. She would often make her way into the kitchen before dinner. Seating herself near the stove, she'd dish out advice on how to season the fish or fry the chicken. She reprimanded him when he tried to serve something as boring as a cold sandwich for lunch, and taught him how to make pastitsio. Shortly after my grandmother passed away, I found a care package from her tucked into the back of my freezer. A little piece of paper, as always, was taped on top of the container. Her note, in typical fashion, was written in a mixture of Greek and English, ""κουνουπίδι καπαμά for my Marisa."" I clutched the frozen packet to my chest like it was the long lost treasure of King John. I ate the ""kounoupidi"" with much procession, a mixture of melancholy and gratification spreading over me as I finished the final plate of my grandmother's cooking. I now make some of her recipes on my own. I hear her voice. I try to remind myself how she did it. Was it a pinch of thyme or oregano? When did she add the olive oil to the lentils? Some of the dishes almost bear her culinary signature. But of course none of them taste exactly the same. The flavor is still perfectly balanced, the carrots nicely diced. There is nothing wrong with any of these dishes, except that they are missing her touch. Here is a ""Recipe"" for my Yiayia's Kounoupidi Kapama, Cauliflower in Cinnamon-Tomato Sauce:1 head of cauliflower Extra virgin olive oil Ground cinnamon Canned tomato 1 Fresh tomato Peas Salt & pepperRinse the cauliflower and dry. Cut the cauliflower into 4 or 5 large pieces. Place a pot over medium high-heat and add about ¼ cup of extra virgin olive oil. Add enough oil to thickly coat the bottom of the pot. Once hot, add the cauliflower browning on all sides. Once browned, reduce the heat to medium low and add a fair amount of cinnamon, enough to make the dish fragrant but not overwhelm. Add some salt and pepper, and a can of good quality diced tomatoes. Dice one fresh tomato and add that in as well. Stir all the ingredients together. Add a little bit of water, just enough to bring the tomato mixture to a sauce-like consistency. Cover the pot and cook for about 20 minutes. Add the peas, about 1 cup, and cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until the peas are cooked through. Add more salt and pepper if needed. Serve the kounoupidi at room temperature with rice."

Any advice for talking with them about what happened to someone they looked up to so much to explain his dishonesty?His fall from grace was from an elevation so high that the sheer impact of hitting the ground created reverbarations across the world. I'm glad you understand how important it is to help your children process the rise -- and now fall -- of Lance Armstrong. Indeed, our kids get many mixed messages about success and what measures are and aren't OK to achieve it. Head to any Little League or kids' basketball game on a Saturday afternoon and you'll see it in action.""Steal the ball! Don't let give him a break! Wear 'em out!""  Our investment in having our children win can clearly override any sportsmanship lectures we might deliver about how it's all about having fun and doing our best.We celebrated Lance Armstong because he was a winner. We made him a hero; practically a god. And now we are trying to make sense of it all. Let Lance's story become an opportunity to help your children begin to understand the complexities that come with being human.Here are some words to introduce into their vocabulary as you, together, explore what it means to win.• Justification. Talk about what can happen when someone cares too much about winning. ""Lance Armstrong said that he talked himself into believing it was OK to use drugs to perform better at cycling because other people were doing it. Do you think that if some people do something that's wrong, it makes it OK for others to do the same?""• Arrogance. Explain that occasionally, when someone becomes powerful -- whether through fame, fortune or accomplishment -- they convince themselves that they don't have to do what is right. ""Sometimes, if people aren't careful, they believe that the rules don't apply to them. What do you think about that?"" • Humiliation. Share a story about a time when someone close to you told a lie and tried to cover it up. ""Do you think they felt ashamed of what they had done? How could they have gotten past their embarrassement to make things right again?""• Betrayal. Invite your kids to share their thoughts about Lance having accused his friends of lying when they were actually telling the truth about his use of banned substances. If you wore a LiveStrong bracelet, or were inspired by his book, talk about your own reaction when you discovered he had been so dishonest. Were you angry? Confused? Hurt?• Remorse. Help your children imagine the effect lying has had on Lance in his quiet moments, when he is all by himself. Invite them to consider how he feels when he looks at his children, his parents and the people he loves and has disappointed. Help them get a sense of what remorse looks and feels like. • Guilt. Ask your children to imagine what Lance was feeling as he stood on the winner's podium when he knew in his heart that he had cheated to get there. ""Do you think he felt uncomfortable about people praising him when he knew he hadn't played fair? Have you ever told a lie and defended yourself, but inside felt really badly?"" • Trust. ""Do you think it will be hard for people to trust Lance again? What do you think he will need to do to regain their trust? How do you think it feels to him to know that people he cares about no longer see him as trustworthy?""• Integrity. Talk about how good it feels to live with integrity. ""Integrity is a word that means living with honor, and being someone who stands by their word. It makes a person feel good about himself. When a person lies and cheats, or blames others instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he is living without integrity. It hurts that person, and all the people who believed in him."" • Forgiveness. Explore what Lance would need to do to be forgiven by the people he has hurt. ""Some people think that when you hurt someone, you should say you're sorry. That's true, but it often takes more than words alone to make things right when you have wounded someone physically or emotionally. What do you think he should do now?""All the gold medals in the world cannot offer relief to a heart burdened by deception and deceit. Use Lance Armstrong's story to initiate age-appropriate discussions with your children about what winning really means: trying your best, staying true to your values, honoring those who believe in you and playing fair and square.Do you have a question for the Parent Coach?

By venturing beyond the city limits we get a different view of a destination's past: the people who founded it, the rock it was carved from, the events that shaped its values and culture.Even the best history museums can't replicate driving 15 minutes from a developing country's capital to a village that was part of another country just a generation ago. All the books about the resiliency of a city's people pale compared to hiking the desolate mountains their ancestors crossed centuries before. And the stories your friends you meet along the way tell about their childhoods become richer when you smell the dinner cooking in their native villages.Savvy travelers know the most authentic way to experience a destination is by replicating the life of the locals.

10,DIVORCE,The Four Lessons I Learned from Lance Armstrong,"Barbara Goldberg, Contributor

Armstrong confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs to win the Tour de France cycling during the interview that aired Thursday, Jan. 17, reversing more than a decade of denial. (AP Photo/Courtesy of Harpo Studios, Inc., George Burns, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cbf002000002d00fdb254.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was mesmerized as I watched the Lance Armstrong interview with Oprah Winfrey. I watched that interview over and over again and was spellbound at each showing. Oprah grilled Lance Armstrong as he admitted to using illegal drugs during his cycling career. After years of denying that he doped, Lance Armstrong came clean. Armstrong was a hero, known for overcoming cancer and winning the Tour de France cycling race seven times. Seven wins seemed like an impossible feat, never accomplished by another human being. After all, the Tour de France is a grueling cycling race, encompassing 2,000 miles over 23 days. His accomplishments were fantastic.Yet, as I watched Armstrong confess his sins, I saw a child of divorce. I saw themes that resonated throughout many of our families. Although most of us were never world-class athletes, we suffered from the same frailties. Here are the lessons I learned from Lance Armstrong:1. Power Your Way Through. Lance's parents divorced when he was two years old. He was raised by his mom and had no relationship with his biological father. Later, his stepfather adopted him. He told Oprah that he and his mother did not believe in looking back. They never discussed their past. He never asked about his biological father. They never talked about what happened to his biological parents' relationship. Lance decided to just power his way through his past.It is a common phenomenon that we ask our children to ""power through"" things. We may not even realize that we are doing it. How many times have you heard a divorced couple tell you that their kids were doing great? I hear it all the time. Do we really believe that? Or, do we need to think that the children are doing great? Does our desire to convince ourselves that we have not done any damage to our children make it impossible for us to see the hurt and damage that we have caused? One lesson that we can garner from the Armstrong interview is to be cognizant and honest about our children's feelings, even if they are not expressing them. We owe our children an open environment where we tell them the truth about our marriages and where they feel comfortable expressing their own emotions, even if our feelings will be hurt. 2. Be Perfect. Lance Armstrong expressed his remorse at taking third place at his last Tour de France race. He truly felt this accomplishment was a huge failure. Conquering cancer was not enough. His past accomplishments were not enough. Finishing this grueling race, knowing that you were one of the fittest people in the world, was not good enough. He had to win and be the best. Children of divorce are more prone to feel the drive to be perfect. Harboring the secret thought that they may have been responsible for their parents' divorce or the reason a parent abandoned the family, they are compelled to want to prove themselves. They want to prove that they are worthy. They want to show everyone that they are unharmed. They want to make certain that the parent who left is sorry for leaving that child who won seven Tour de France races. In addition to the self-imposed pressure described above, we live in a society that seems to demand perfection. I always hated when I would hear other moms talk about how perfect their kids were. How did their children become so perfect when all of us were so imperfect? We should be explaining to our children that it is their job to be imperfect. That is how they learn what they want to do with their lives.   3. Control Everything. Armstrong repeated over and over again that he felt compelled to control everything that happened with his cycling team. He admitted to suing and threatening people who had told the truth about his activities. At the time, his desperate need to feel control over his environment justified this behavior. Divorce is traumatic. Anytime a parent leaves, the effect is cataclysmic. The human brain wants to protect the child's broken heart by inserting the thought that control is the answer to a happy life. Do you see your children reacting negatively to constant change? Do they seem to want more consistency? Do they have irrational fears? Understand that these kids know that a bad thing can happen at any time. Do your best to keep schedules consistent. Do anything you can to convince your children that they are safe.  4. Win At All Cost. I loved hearing Lance Armstrong's disappointment as he described to Oprah how his third place finish at the Tour de France was a failure. Clearly, his definition of winning was to come in first. There was no other choice or option. To qualify to compete was a huge honor and accomplishment. You had to be in incredible physical shape. Being on a Tour de France team was just not enough. You had to be wearing the yellow jersey. How often do we try to come in first within our families? Have you ever viewed a competition among the adults in your family to gain the love and affection of the children? Do you see the children pitting one parent against another? Are we trying to win? Our family relationships are not a competition. The goal is to love to our maximum capacities. We triumph by loving our children, their mother and all of the important people in their lives. In this way, we show our future athletes how to truly win in the game of life."
