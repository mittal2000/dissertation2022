0,ARTS,Cinematic Ukraine: Getting Ready for the 5th Odessa International Film Festival,"E. Nina Rothe, ContributorCultural Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cinematic-ukraine-getting_b_5562999.html,"There is no better time for a film festival in Ukraine, even if it would appear to be during such a volatile moment in the country's history.",2014-07-07,2014-07-07-2014042304193358117_655583627803006_1356990741_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-07-2014042304193358117_655583627803006_1356990741_n-thumb.jpg,"Back in May of this year, the Odessa International Film Festival embarked on a crowdfunding campaign to raise $25,000 through Indiegogo. To quote festival organizers, their financial goal was needed to ""maintain the high level of the line-up and hold the Ukrainian National Competition,"" an integral part of the festival. Needless to say, they reached their target and even surpassed it by a bit, and as a result the Odessa IFF will be taking place in just a few days, from July 11th through the 19th. There is no better time for a film festival in Ukraine, even if it would appear to be during such a volatile moment in the country's history. I'm with the Odessa IFF team all the way when they write, ""we believe that cinema is a powerful tool of a civil protest, it unites people of all nationalities and is able to make a positive change as well as to raise the spirit of a nation. That's why the Odessa IFF should take place in Ukraine this year!""All we have to do is read a newspaper, click on Twitter or turn on our TVs to know we are living in an increasingly divisive and divided world. Sometimes I notice people's eyes glaze over when I say my sole purpose in writing about world cinema is to unite, create a bridge of cultural understanding through the Seventh Art. Today, as illogical battles rage on in Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Israel and even Ukraine, my mission seems far off, unpopular, and impossible. But when I read a statement like the one above put out there by filmmakers, who insist on going against all the odds with a festival they believe in deeply, while also reaching out to the world asking for their support -- and receiving it in return! -- I'm encouraged. We may turn out to be OK after all.This year's Odessa IFF will open with Paolo Virzi's Il Capitale Umano, or Human Capital, which stars Valeria Golino and Valeria Bruni Tedeschi and screened in the US earlier this year at the Tribeca Film Festival. It will close with Vincent Lannoo's Les Ames de Papier, Paper Souls starring Stephane Guillon and Julie Gayet. But the grandiosity, the artistry of the festival also lies in those seven days in between.There will be screenings of two 2014 Cannes favorites, the French Party Girl by Marie Amachoukeli, Claire Burger and Samuel Theis -- this year's Camera d'Or winner -- and Winter Sleep by Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan, Hitchcock's Blackmail and Fantomas by Louis Feuillade will be shown on the big screens of two grandiose outdoor venues, the Potemkin Stairs and the Lanzheron descent. There will be international features, shorts, Ukrainian films and world documentaries all vying for prizes and audiences. I'm particularly curious at how Jehane Noujaim's Oscar-nominated The Square will be received, when it screens in the ""Way to Freedom"" section, alongside other filmed documents to a world in revolution, such as Maidan and Velvet Terrorists. The tagline of the section is a vintage quote by South African activist Albie Sachs, yet one oh-so actual today: ""All revolutions are impossible until they happen; then they become inevitable.""And then there are Galas, as no self-respecting festival happens without a few of those, and masterclasses, such as one online with Darren Aronofsky and a Q & A with Stephen Frears, who is also the festival's Guest of Honor at this momentous fifth edition. A tribute series of screenings of films by the master filmmaker include My Beautiful Laundrette and his latest Philomena. The festival's concurrent film market features a few talks on the business of filmmaking, a pitching session and a section for works-in-progress. In fact, two of the films in the festival this year, both by Ukrainian filmmakers, were seen as works-in-progress in last year's market at Odessa IFF. They are My Mermaid, My Lorelei by Nana Dzhordzhadze and The Guide by Oles Sanin. Finally, I leave you with the inspiring words of Festival President Viktoriya Tigipko, who sent chills up my spine when she disclosed:This year has been very difficult and at the same time momentous both for the country and every one of us. Our team is doing the very best for this festival to happen and be held on a top level. We have been supported in our aspiration by our colleagues: over 250 influential representatives of international film festivals, including Cannes, Berlin and Venice, have outspoken their support of our festival. Their support demonstrates that OIFF, during the five years of its existence, has exceeded the level of a national event and made its way to an international film festivals agenda.For more details, as well as the full program of films, check out the Odessa IFF website.

But in addition to being a powerful personal practice, prayer can play a role in strengthening even the most diverse communities, according to a new study led by a University of Connecticut sociologist Ruth Braunstein, Richard L. Wood from the University of New Mexico and Brad R. Fulton from Duke University. Scheduled to appear in the August edition of the American Sociological Review, the study found that interfaith prayer practices played a key role in bridging cultural differences within diverse faith-based community organizing groups in the United States.“The prayer practices we observed appear to play a crucial role in binding participants together across significant racial and socioeconomic differences,” Braunstein said in a release. “They do this by being inclusive of multiple faith traditions, celebrating the diversity of the group, and encouraging individuals to interact with each other.”These findings may come as a surprise in a world where religion and prayer often divide people with differing views. Braunstein found, however, that “bridging cultural practices,"" like prayer, worked to create a new sense of shared identity within groups.""Most talk of diversity rests on an understanding of ""differences"" that are rooted in fixed categories, like racial groups, genders, social classes, etc.,"" Braunstein told HuffPost. ""In reality, however, one way that groups navigate diversity is by defining new identity categories, which cut across, transcend, or celebrate members’ differences, often by highlighting what distinguishes them from people outside of their group. Generally speaking, this suggests that things like difference and sameness are really very fluid.""Prayer only works as a practice for transcending difference, though, when it manages to incorporate values from multiple faiths and backgrounds, Braunstein said. In the faith-based community organizing coalition where Braunstein conducted her research, leaders and clergy often highlighted the group's shared identities as ""people of faith"" while still recognizing their differences. They did this in several ways:""One common way was by inviting multiple clergy representing different faith traditions to offer prayers. In some cases, clergy also instructed audience members to direct prayers to their respective understandings of God. For example, a priest once called everyone to prayer by saying: “If you are Jewish, stand for Adonai. If you are Muslim, stand for Allah. If you are Christian like me, stand for Jesus.” Prayer is a meaningful practice for faith-based groups, Braunstein said, but it won't necessarily work in secular organizations where spirituality isn't a part of the group's shared identity. There are other activities diverse groups can do, however, to build solidarity and develop shared ""rituals"" important to the group's identity. ""These practices, which could involve sharing meals or making music together,"" Braunstein said, ""would likely emerge over time as participants reflected on the qualities that unite everyone in the group and develop shared rituals that are meaningful to everyone.""No one is putting the power of ""bridging cultural practices"" to the test more prominently than Pope Francis, who hosted Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to a peacemaking ""prayer summit"" at the Vatican in June. Though divided by significant religious and political differences, these three world leaders joined together in prayer as a display of their commitment to the peacemaking process.""All my life I shall never stop to act for peace, for the generations to come,"" Peres said during the service. ""Let us all join hands and make it happen.”"

His courageous and brilliant actions in Budapest during World War II that saved tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews from the Holocaust deserve our respect, admiration and emulation. This coming Wednesday on July 9, the American Congress will speak for all Americans and convey a powerful message through the bestowal of the Congressional Gold Medal to remember the courageous acts of Raoul Wallenberg.

Many of these diplomats were censured or punished for their acts of courage. Some were fired. Some were stripped of their ranks and pensions. Others were ostracized in their home countries.

Because they believed that ""One man can make a difference."" That is the sentence written on the front door of the Raoul Wallenberg School in Brooklyn, New York, one of the many American institutions honoring Raoul Wallenberg. In 1981, the U.S. Congress made Raoul Wallenberg an honorary U.S. citizen, at that time just the second person in history to be honored that way.""The importance of not being indifferent"" is a timely and relevant operating principle in our relationship with the world today. Advancing human dignity and promoting universal rights is at the core of American values. It is also relevant to the challenges of our times, be they in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere.During his historic visit to Sweden last September, President Barack Obama captured the essence of Wallenberg's legacy: Wallenberg's life is a challenge to us all -- to live those virtues of empathy and compassion, even when it's hard, even when it involves great risk. He came from a prominent family, but he chose to help the most vulnerable. He was a Lutheran, and yet he risked his life to save Jews. ""I will never be able to go back to Stockholm,"" he said, ""without knowing inside myself I'd done all a man could do to save as many Jews as possible."" So when Jews in Budapest were marked with that yellow star, Wallenberg shielded them behind the blue and yellow of the Swedish flag. When they were forced into death marches, he showed up with the food and water that gave them life. When they were loaded on trains for the camps, he climbed on board too and pulled them off. He lived out one of the most important mitzvot, most important commandments in the Jewish tradition -- to redeem a captive; to save a life; the belief that when a neighbor is suffering, we cannot stand idly by.As we consider Wallenberg's personal sacrifice, we must remember Wallenberg's tragic end: Languishing in lonely incarceration until he died. Wallenberg epitomizes what self-sacrifice for the sake of others in the context of indifference to human suffering is all about.While Wallenberg had trained to be an architect, the legacy he left behind is far stronger than one built in stone and mortar; it is the successor generations that followed the people he saved who are today the citizens who are building our societies. Wallenberg not only saved thousands of lives, he also saved our future. It is our duty to keep his memory alive for those future generations who might not have existed without his sacrifice; and to remember that the actions of one person can make an astounding difference.Mark Brzezinski serves as United States Ambassador to Sweden."

(Photo by Jim Rogash/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb767cc1f0000000225044a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter thinks Boston Red Sox pitcher John Lackey might want to think twice before complaining about baseball players using performance-enhancing drugs. Following a game in which Baltimore's Nelson Cruz went 5-for-5, including a homer and a double off Lackey, the Red Sox starter all but brought up the O's slugger's past suspension for PEDs. ""I'm not going to comment on him,"" Lackey said after Boston's 7-4 defeat on Saturday, via Eduardo A. Encina of The Baltimore Sun. As a member of the Texas Rangers in 2013, Cruz was suspended 50 games for violating the MLB's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program in relation to the Biogenesis scandal. ""I've got nothing to say about him. There are some things I'd like to say, but I'm not going to. You guys forget pretty conveniently about stuff.""Appearing on ESPN Radio's ""Mike Lupica Show"" on Sunday, Showalter shrugged off Lackey's comments and said the righty ""might want to be careful"" going down that road. ""I think everybody needs to make sure that their own backyard is clean,"" Showalter said, perhaps referring to Boston slugger David Ortiz who reportedly tested positive for PEDs in 2003. ""There are so many insinuations, quite frankly, about people in every club. You usually don't hear those comments after a shutout or something. I mean the guy is doing really well ... It's one of those things you just be quiet about and it reflects poorly on the person who said it."" Listen to the full segment here. Other Red Sox players haven't shied away from voicing their strong feelings against PED-users since the Biogenesis suspensions last season. But when asked back in April about the possibility of having a teammate who has used PEDs before, Boston catcher David Ross understood the inconsistency of his feelings. ""As human beings, we have a funny way of looking at it,"" Ross told Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports. ""If it happens to our family, we'll console 'em. If it happens to an outsider's family, we'll condemn him."""

Thousands more have been apprehended with parents or other adults.""We have to do right by the children, but at the end of the day, our border is not open to illegal migration and we will stem the tide,"" Jeh Johnson, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.Johnson said that the government administers deportation proceedings to illegal migrants seized at the border, including children. But he added that the government is looking at being more flexible toward the children seized at the border.""We are looking at ways to create additional options for dealing with the children, in particular, consistent with our laws and our values,"" Johnson said.Johnson repeated the stance, taken by President Barack Obama last week, that the president would take executive action to revamp the U.S. immigration system.""There are a number of things the president and I, within the confines of existing law, can do to fix the broken immigration system. If Congress doesn't act, we will,"" Johnson said.Johnson would not answer a question on the Sunday show pertaining to whether the U.S. government would deport the current wave of Central American children, saying only that U.S. authorities would stem the tide, and that deportation processes are commenced against illegal immigrants.U.S. immigration officials say the crisis is being driven by a mix of extreme poverty, gangs and drug violence in Central America, as well as rumors perpetuated by human smugglers that children who reach the U.S. border will be allowed to stay.Critics say that the Obama administration has not moved quickly enough to address the problem.Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat whose congressional district includes a stretch of the Texas-Mexico border, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program that 48,000 people, including 9,700 children traveling without parents, were detained on the Texas border in May.""We should have been ready for this surge,"" he said. ""The administration should have been ready ... They should have seen this coming a long time ago.""Idaho Representative Raul Labrador, a Republican, said the U.S. needs to take a strong stance against what is happening at border facilities.""The thing that the administration needs to do is immediately deport these families, these children. I know it sounds harsh, I know it sounds difficult, but they're creating a crisis that's going to harm these children,"" he said on ""Meet the Press.""Labrador added that the frustration building up is because the administration is doing nothing about border security.

JohnsonSEATTLE, July 6 (Reuters) - His glass pipes are on display and final regulatory hurdles nearly cleared, but the biggest concern for Cannabis City owner James Lathrop as he opens his Seattle pot shop this week is the possibility of running out of mind-altering bud in a matter of hours.""What do you do when your shelves are empty? Do I just send everybody home? Do we try and stay open? I can't pay people if we aren't selling anything,"" said Lathrop, who expects to become one of Washington state's first legal marijuana retailers this week as the state issues licenses.The state is poised on Monday to become the second after Colorado to allow retail sales of recreational marijuana to adults, under a heavily regulated and taxed system that voters approved in November 2012. Stores could begin operations as early as Tuesday, with up to 20 expected to open statewide.While Colorado, where regulated retail sales rolled out fairly smoothly in January, is collecting millions of dollars per month in tax revenues, Washington has charted a glacial and more halting path to market.Pot regulators, business owners and analysts say pot could sell out in Washington within hours or days at the few shops slated to open on Tuesday. That is largely because of limited harvests by licensed growers and processors, or because they failed to clear regulatory hurdles to get their product to market.Washington is also grappling with a backlog of hundreds of would-be growers who still need to be screened by overwhelmed investigators with the state Liquor Control Board, agency spokesman Brian Smith said.The board has so far licensed fewer than 80 growers statewide, out of more than 2,600 applicants. And only a fraction of their pot -- roughly 560,000 square feet is in production, or about 10 football fields' worth -- has gone through required lab-testing. Many harvests won't be ready by early July.""There is a gold rush mentality. Many didn't read what it would require to get a license. ... We didn't expect 7,000 applicants,"" Smith said of the number of interested growers, processors and retailers.Cannabis City's Lathrop could find only one grower ready to ship on July 8, opening day, and plans to suggest customers stick to a 2-gram limit to stretch his supply. HIGH PRICESShoppers looking to get high on Tuesday could see a gram selling at $15-$30, said Dominic Corva, executive director of Seattle's Center for the Study of Cannabis and Social Policy.Novelty-seekers and tourists might pay $25 or $30 per gram - roughly twice the current price at weakly regulated medical dispensaries. At those prices, heavy users will stick with neighborhood dispensaries or drug dealers, Corva said.Even as legal retail operations roll out, dozens of cities have enacted pot moratoriums or outright bans. Also, no stores will carry popular ""edibles,"" such as pot-infused brownies, because no processor has been cleared to operate a cannabis kitchen.Investors and regulators remain hopeful the market will ramp up in the coming months as more growers, processors and retailers come on line.But at least one grower expects it will take much longer.""It'll be at least three to five years before we meet the demand,"" said Bob Leeds, co-owner of Seattle-based Sea of Green Farms, which got its license to grow and process pot in March.On a recent afternoon, Leeds' employees were huddled around a table packing palm-sized baggies with pot strains like Dutch Hawaiian, Space Needle and Double Purple Doja. They were inching toward the 36,000 bags as well as hemp-paper cigarillos they will ship to stores statewide.Leeds said he charges stores about $3,000 to $4,500 per pound, or $7 to $10 per gram before local, state and excise taxes, and any retail mark-up. He predicts stores will sell out within hours of opening on Tuesday.""There won't be any more until weeks from now,"" he said. ""We'll have our second crop in July.""

(Photo by Harry How/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb767cb200000c50101619e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On June 8th, the San Francisco Giants were 42-21 and in first game by 9.5 games. They appeared to be running away with the National League west leaving, among others, a highly touted and very expensive Dodger team far behind. Since that time they have won only six games while losing 18, and are now in second place. With the season only half over, the Giants still could end up with a playoff spot, but if they continue their losing ways for another week or two, even that will be unlikely.The Giants were not going to play .667 baseball for the whole season, as they had through their first 63 games, but they certainly looked like a team that was too good to play .250 ball for a month. The easiest way to explain a collapse of this kind is to attribute it, in one for or another, to a change of luck and injuries. Luck and injuries certainly have played a role, but that is only part of the story. One of the main reasons the Giants were winning in the first part of the season was because they were getting extraordinary contributions from their second tier hitters. Stars like Buster Posey, Pablo Sandoval and Brandon Belt were playing at or under expectations -- Belt went on the disabled list long before the Giants started to fade. However, Michael Morse and Brandon Hicks were exceeding expectations. Morse, for example, posted OPS of over .900 through the end of May, but had on OPS of .612 in June. Similarly, Hicks has had an OPS of under .450 since June 1, but was well over .600 when the Giants were winning.The combination of injuries to Belt and Angel Pagan, the latter of whom was perhaps the only Giants star who was having a genuinely great year through June 8th, put stress on the team as part time players like Gregor Blanco and Tyler Colvin were more or less thrust into full time positions. If Morse and Hicks had continued hitting after the injuries, the Giants would have probably played closer to .500 ball during this stretch, but the injuries and cooling off of the secondary talent proved too much. By the end of June, a typical Giant lineup included Blanco, light hitting prospect Joe Panik and some combination of Colvin and Adam Duvall, as well as usually Brandon Crawford and Morse, who were no longer delivering the big hits. The other part of the puzzle was Sergio Romo suddenly being seemingly unable to close out a save. Because of this, the Giants bullpen rapidly went from being an asset to being a problem. All of these problems would be manageable for a team that had a deeper farm system than the Giants. With Belt and Blanco out, the Giants lack of strong hitting prospects was exposed. The Giants seem to have a lot of good fielding, fast fourth outfielder types in the like Blanco, Juan Perez and Gary Brown, but the absence of any legitimate power hitter in the high minors who could play either first base or the outfield, something that most teams have, cost the Giants. The best they could do was Colvin, who has rarely been an impact hitter in his six big league seasons and Duvall.The problems of the Giants farm system was made worse by the Giants inexplicably slow reaction to the injuries and slumps. They made almost no effort to pick up a bat when Pagan and Belt went down and Morse stopped hitting. Again, they did not need to add a legitimate big league slugger, just somebody who could hit a little bit with some power. That kind of 4A player is usually available somewhere, but it is not clear they even looked. Romo's recent failures were also allowed to go on too long before he was finally removed from the closer role. Replacing Romo does not require going outside the organization; and the Giants have wisely avoided doing this. However, Romo's popularity with the fans and perceived centrality to the team may have made it easy for the organization to overlook his struggles for too long. Romo's like many closers, peaked as a setup man in 2011. Every year since then, his ERA, FIP and walks per nine innings have gone up while his strikeouts per nine innings have declined.In some regards the Giants downturn was predictable, and should have been predicted, by the organization. Assuming the team will keep winning because everybody will stay healthy and continue to hit is not a strategy appropriate for a 162-game season, but this appears to be what the Giants were doing. Making moves in the beginning of the slump would have been hard to do and would have made the Giants vulnerable to accusations of panicking. Nobody could have known how badly, for example, Morse and Hicks were going to slump. However, the failure to have some options within the organization before the season began, and the failure to recognize the real possibility that Romo was not going to remain a dominant closer were mistakes that could have been avoided."

Hospital officials confirmed the fatalities, and the Israeli military confirmed it had bombed central Gaza.But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled that broader Israeli action was not imminent.The burning-alive of 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khudair, and the earlier killings of three kidnapped Israeli teenagers, have driven relations between Palestinians and Israelis to their lowest point since U.S.-backed peace talks broke down in April.The security source gave no details about the suspects arrested in the investigation into the abduction and killing of Abu Khudair, other than to say they were Jewish and that police saw ""nationalist motives"" in the case.Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said a gag order had been imposed on most details of the case, commenting only that police had arrested a number of Jewish people suspected of carrying out the killing.Israel's Shin Bet security agency said the suspects were being questioned at one of its installations.Despite the gag order, Israeli media said a court had ordered the suspects remanded into custody for eight days. Police declined to comment. Israel's Channel 2 television said the suspects were far-right extremists, among them minors, from the Jerusalem area and a nearby Jewish settlement.Abu Khudair's burnt body was discovered in a Jerusalem forest on Wednesday. Palestinians believe he was the victim of far-right Jews avenging the kidnap-killing of the three Israeli teenagers who disappeared while hitchhiking in the occupied West Bank on June 12, and whose bodies were found on June 30.Israel blames the deaths of Naftali Fraenkel and Gil-Ad Shaer, both 16, and 19-year-old Eyal Yifrah on the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas. The Gaza flare-up began in mid-June during Israel's search for the teenagers in the West Bank, when it arrested some Hamas members.Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the killings of the Israelis.Netanyahu, speaking at a visit to the Fraenkel family, demanded Palestinian leaders do everything to find the killers of the young Israelis.He said the Palestinian self-rule government in the West Bank was ""obliged to do everything in its powers to find them ... just as our security forces located the suspects in the murder of Mohammed Abu Khudair within a matter of days.""'TERROR CRIMES'An autopsy attended by a Palestinian pathologist showed soot in the teenager's lungs, indicating he was still alive when he was set on fire, the Palestinian attorney general said.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he sent a message to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urging the formation of an international investigation committee into ""terror crimes conducted against our people, including the burning alive of Mohammed Abu Khudair.""Netanyahu said Abu Khudair's killers would face ""the full weight of the law,"" adding that in Israeli society ""there is no place for such murderers.""""We won't let extremists on either side set the area on fire and lead to bloodshed,"" Netanyahu said, while also condemning violent protests by some Israeli Arabs in northern Israel.Dozens of protesters threw stones at passing cars for a third day in Israel's Galilee region, where a majority of Israel's Arab citizens live, this time targeting a highway in the Haifa area where a fatal accident was reported, police said.Israel Radio said two Palestinians from the West Bank had been killed in the accident, sparking anger in nearby Arab villages.Israeli police in riot-control gear were deployed near some Israeli Arab towns after that confrontation in an apparent effort to try to keep violence from spreading. A Reuters reporter saw half a dozen vans, a water cannon truck, and officers with shields on guard outside a frequent flashpoint in the general Haifa region.In remarks to his Cabinet earlier on Sunday, Netanyahu pledged ""to do whatever is necessary"" to restore quiet to southern Israeli communities that have come under rocket attack from the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is the dominant force.He cautioned against any rush toward wider confrontation with the group, whose arsenal includes long-range rockets that can reach Israel's heartland and its business capital, Tel Aviv.The Israeli military said more than 20 rockets fired from Gaza struck inside Israel on Sunday. No casualties were reported.""Experience has shown that during moments like these, one must act in a level-headed and responsible manner and not hastily,"" Netanyahu told his Cabinet in broadcast remarks.Israel beefed up ground forces along the Gaza frontier on Thursday, a deployment seen as sending a message to Palestinian militants that an invasion was an option if rocket fire did not stop.The two militants killed and the man who was wounded in the Israeli air strike after darkness fell were from an armed wing of Abbas's Fatah faction, residents and medical officials said. Their deaths raised to five the number of Palestinians in Gaza killed in Israeli air raids since mid-June.Palestinian-American Tariq Khdeir, 15, a cousin of the slain Palestinian teenager, was arrested by Israeli border policemen, who his family said beat him severely, during a protest on Thursday in East Jerusalem.An Israeli court on Sunday ordered Khdeir released from jail and placed under house arrest for nine days. The high school student had been visiting family in East Jerusalem. His mother said the family planned to return to Tampa, Florida, on July 16.The U.S. State Department said Khdeir should be able to return to Florida with his family this month ""if the investigation is concluded promptly.""""We are profoundly troubled by reports that he was severely beaten while in police custody and strongly condemn any excessive use of force,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.""As we stated yesterday we are calling for a speedy, transparent and credible investigation and full accountability for the apparent excessive use of force,"" the statement added.Israel's Justice Ministry said the police internal affairs office was looking into the incident.

A reasonably large crowd came to hear about the downbeat topic of attorney suicides. Two years ago, a number of Kentucky attorneys took their own lives. All men, mostly middle aged.Some of the people who killed themselves were my friends. One was a good friend. Like I did, he grew up on the banks of the Ohio River in Northern Kentucky, just a few miles from where the convention was taking place. When I looked around the room, I saw two of his closest friends sitting in the front row. I knew they were thinking what I was thinking: ""Could I have done anything to stop it?""The better question is the one that the Kentucky Bar Association was putting forward. What could we do to prevent other attorneys from killing themselves? We were there to find that answer. ""And find I'm king of the hill Top of the heap"" -- Liza Minnelli It was an entirely different atmosphere the night before. A festive reception to honor three attorneys who were being inducted into the University of Kentucky Law School Hall of Fame.The room was packed with some of Kentucky's most legendary attorneys. Two of the inductees, Lexington trial attorney Bill Garmer and former Congressman and Kentucky Attorney General Ben Chandler are close friends of mine. I did not know the third inductee, David Denton of Paducah, but it was obvious from the people who spoke on his behalf that he richly deserved the honor.Many associate life achievement awards, such as induction into a Hall of Fame, as something that happens near the end of life. Congressman Chandler's grandfather, A.B. ""Happy"" Chandler, was inducted into the University of Kentucky Law School Hall of Fame six years after his death in 1991. Once you're admitted to the Hall of Fame, where do you go next? You don't see baseball players coming back on the field after their induction. Garmer and Chandler are relatively young to receive such an honor, but using the baseball analogy of Johnny Bench and Sandy Koufax, they were able to accomplish a lot in a short period of time. The difference is that Garmer and Chandler plan on adding to their accomplishments for many years to come. In fact, Chandler's political fortunes may change dramatically. One of the stipulations for being a Hall of Fame member is that they not hold political office, and Ben Chandler, on the same slate as an unpopular President Obama in Kentucky, lost his congressional seat in 2012. The day of the Hall of Fame might mark the rebirth of Ben Chandler's political career. Earlier that day, State Auditor Adam Edelen, considered by many (including me) to be the front runner for the Democratic Party nomination for Governor in 2015, unexpectedly decided not to run for Governor and seek re-election as Auditor instead.When cornered by the only journalist in the room, Chandler said that Edelen's withdrawal would make him consider a race for Governor more strongly. Many people think that Chandler would retire from politics after losing the Congressional race, but coming back has been a mantra of the Chandler family. What got Chandler for his first election was his courage to run months after suffering a devastating loss in 2003 for Governor. He wound up replacing the man who beat him for Governor in Congress. Happy Chandler lost many races, but wound up winning two terms as Governor and was elected to the U.S. Senate before he left to become baseball commissioner. Chandler would not confirm it, but my gut feeling tells me that you will see Chandler in the 2015 race for Governor or in 2016, when Rand Paul's Senate seat will open up when he seeks the presidency. I'm not sure how you measure tenacity, but I suspect it is a trait that separates the Hall of Fame inductees from the rest of the pack.Bill Garmer's fierce determination is something that might not be evident on the surface. Bill is the epitome of a Southern Gentlemen. He has the calm demeanor, impeccable manners, attire and respect for the law to make him a trial lawyer's trial lawyer. He doesn't advertise and doesn't need to. He studies every nuance of the law and like every truly great attorney I have ever known, his ethical behavior is beyond reproach. You can see why the University of Kentucky Law School would want to honor Garmer and have him teach litigation skills at the law school: they want every one of their graduates to have the reverence and respect for the law that Bill has. Bill successfully represented me years ago in a business litigation matter. There was not a lot of money involved, but Bill went at it like we were in front of the United States Supreme Court. I suspect the reason it settled was that the other side was not prepared to go into battle against someone as prepared and organized as Bill Garmer. Bill has won million dollar verdicts and won cases that have changed the nature of Kentucky law. Having had the unique opportunity to assist him for over 25 years as a structured settlement and mediation consultant, I've seen him go up against big corporations and insurance companies that tried to intimidate him. Even if they defeat him in trial, he keeps coming back and coming back and often wins on appeal. Some of my other friends, like Peter Perlman and Pierce Hamblin, are also in the University of Kentucky College of Law Hall of Fame. Just like Chandler and Garmer, they are people I would want to have in my foxhole if I were ever in a battle. To quote the late Jim Valvano, they ""never, never, never, ever give up."" ""Or I may simply be a single drop of rain But I will remain And I'll be back again  And again and again and again and again"" -Jimmy Webb Jimmy Webb's great song ""Highwayman"" was about how people and their spirit live on after their bodies die. Also, it ends with the line, ""I'll be back again, and again and again and again...""Lawyers are warriors who come back from adversity. So why it is that over a dozen Kentucky attorneys in the span of a couple of years decided to kill themselves?Because there is huge burnout factor in being a warrior. What first brought the issue of attorney suicides to the front burner was a piece called ""Broken Hearted Idealists"" written by Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Bill Cunningham. He cited research from the National Institute of Safety and Health that noted that attorneys were twice as likely to kill themselves. He noted a survey by John Hopkins University that showed that attorneys had the highest signs of clinical depression of any occupation and that attorneys tend to focus on their needs of their clients rather than their own needs. 15 to 18 percent of attorneys are alcoholics, as opposed to 10 percent of the general population. In a beautifully written and heartfelt piece, Justice Cunningham notes that attorneys have pressure to always be perfectionists and any lack of perfection can result in huge consequences. Clients can lose their money, their freedom and, in states with capital punishment (like Kentucky), their lives. Everyone comes to them with problems and few come with solutions. Justice Cunningham poured out his heart. He also did something bigger; he put the attorney suicide issue in play. In these days of fragmented media, it's hard for a news story to take hold in a wider audience, but Justice Cunningham's piece got many people, especially Shannon Ragland, Publisher of the Kentucky Trial Court Review, to zero in on the problem.Ragland has an interesting story. Early in his legal career, his personal demons put him in a position where he lost his license to practice law. He used his legal knowledge to switch careers. He started to put out a terrific set of must-have legal publications that study jury verdicts in Kentucky and has leveraged that into similar publications in a many other states. In the meantime, he wrote a groundbreaking piece of historic significance about a University of Kentucky football squad in the early 1960s and currently has a book, Zen of McConnell (about Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell) which is doing well on the Amazon charts. Ragland got the story on my radar and I wrote a piece for the Huffington Post which helped to draw attention to the issue in Kentucky and nationally. As the ball rolled forward, more and more people around and in the legal community have taken notice and one new statistic jumps out.No other attorney has killed themselves in Kentucky since the wave of media attention has begun. You have to credit the efforts of the people in that seminar for stopping the wave. Kentucky is unique in that the Kentucky Bar Association has a terrific program called the Kentucky Lawyer's Assistance Program (KLAP) which is run by attorney Yvette Hourigan and in place to help attorneys with drug, alcohol and emotional issues. In an article in Business Lexington, John Meyers, Executive Director of the Kentucky Bar Association, noted that the Kentucky Bar Association offers free continuing legal education to its members and has addressed over 7000 lawyers in the state about what KLAP offers and how attorneys can get help.It is making a difference. As noted, the suicide streak has stopped and I suspect heightened awareness that suicide is possible has made all of us who interact with attorneys more proactive. After I wrote the Huffington Post piece, a couple of attorneys contacted me who were obviously struggling. I knew one and did not know the other, but got both of them to contact Yvette and see what her program has to offer. I suspect it helped. They are still with us. I also suspect that before I lost my friends to suicide, I would not have been so adamant or not taken the signs seriously. Now I have and I always will. Most of who attended the session, with Justice Cunningham and Hourigan as moderators, were there with that mission, to make sure it did not happen again. The last presentation came from Len Ogden, a Paducah attorney who has fought depression and is a recovering alcoholic. He gave a gripping and compelling talk about his own suicide attempt, how he got there and how he got help.Hourigan wrote a paper entitled, ""When Depression Turns Deadly: The Impacts of Addiction and Depression on Suicide among Lawyers and How to Recognize the Warning Signs."" I am including a link to the entire, must-read paper, but she lists the warning signs for suicide risk which are:1. Observable signs of serious depression  2. Increased alcohol and other drug use 3. Recent impulsiveness and taking unnecessary risks; reckless behavior 4. Threatening suicide or expressing a strong wish to die 5. Making a plan, which includes things like giving away prized possessions, impulsively purchasing a firearm and obtaining poisons  6. Unexpected rage or angerWhen those signs appear, it's time to get on the KLAP hotline and get the attorney in the hands of professionals who have been there. Ogden and Hourigan noted attorneys by nature are hesitant to reach out. While many are in heavy debt from law school student loans and internal financial pressures, attorneys aren't making the kind of money that previous generations did, and financial pressures and job dissatisfaction make a person look like a Hall of Famer in the public eye when actually they are struggling on many levels. Like the character in the Edwin Arlington Robinson poem Richard Cory (which I will post in full at the end), people on the verge of suicide often appear to have it all together in their public persona. Even if they are melting inside. ""I've fought with the devil Got down on his level But I never gave in So he gave up on me"" -- Keith Whitley It's possible to be both a future Hall of Fame inductee and someone once on the verge of suicide. One of the great influences in my life is one of the greatest living Kentuckians, Al Smith. At age 87, Al is writing books and making an impact, but until his mid 30s, he was living in a sleeping room hotel in the small town of Russellville, Kentucky with a serious addiction to alcohol. As noted in his gripping biography Wordsmith, suicidal thoughts were a constant presence in Al's life. Over 51 years ago, Al stumbled into an AA meeting, hit that ""bottoming out"" point that people must have to make a turnaround and started his ascent as a successful newspaper reporter, then publisher, then television host, author and nonstop civic volunteer, with a stop in Washington when President Jimmy Carter named him to head the Appalachian Regional Commission. Al is a member of many Hall of Fames and received a boatload of civic honors. He has a beautiful family, a great life and is as far from the sleeping room in Russellville as you can get. His energy comes from giving back to repay all those who helped him. When you are at the bottom, it's hard to see anything but darkness, but those who are willing to help others and accept help for themselves have a chance of seeing their true and great potential. It could be that one of us keeps an attorney from killing themselves. It could be that somewhere down the road that same attorney channels the tenacity that allows them to kick their demons and live the kind of life that gets them inducted in their Law School Hall of Fame.When they are looking for role models of what a Hall of Famer should be like, the three men who were inducted by the University of Kentucky are a good place to start. Our hurting friends need help. With some support and the opportunity to deal with their problems, they may someday honor the practice of law the way that Bill Garmer, Ben Chandler and David Denton do. 'Richard Cory'Whenever Richard Cory went down town, We people on the pavement looked at him: He was a gentleman from sole to crown, Clean favored, and imperially slim.And he was always quietly arrayed, And he was always human when he talked;  But still he fluttered pulses when he said, 'Good-morning,' and he glittered when he walked.And he was rich - yes, richer than a king - And admirably schooled in every grace: In fine, we thought that he was everything To make us wish that we were in his place.So on we worked, and waited for the light, And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;  And Richard Cory, one calm summer night, Went home and put a bullet through his head.

A total of 41 of the attackers were killed while another 12 were captured during the raids on Saturday evening, he added.The gunmen, from a local militia, had no connection to the Islamist rebel group ADF-NALU, which preyed on the local population in the late 1990s and early 2000s before it was defeated and forced to flee into the jungles of neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo.""What we know is that this militia is not linked with ADF-NALU but we're studying them to establish their motives and their backers,"" Ankunda said.""We are interrogating those that we captured and we hope to find out who is behind these attacks.""The attackers stole 13 guns from the police stations they raided, the military spokesman added.Uganda worries that ADF-NALU, if left unchallenged in Congo's loosely governed east, poses a threat to its oil fields in the Albertine rift basin where Tullow Oil, Total and China's CNOOC. are preparing for commercial production.

While still a majority belief, the number is down from 82% who believed this in the 1950s, while the number of Americans who believe religion is old fashioned and out of date has grown to 30% from less than 10%.As the percentages of Americans who believe religion can answer today's problems and those who believe religion to be outdated have slowly approached one another, faith has remained an important part of life for roughly half of Americans. Among those who say religion is ""very important"" in their lives, the belief in its ability to solve modern issues is significantly greater.More than 80% of Americans who attend church weekly believe religion can answer today's problems, dropping to 68% with weekly and monthly attendance. Even among Americans who have no religious identification whatsoever, 21% believe religion can still help solve all or most of today's problems.Demographics also play a role in determining a person's faith in the ability of religion to bring relief from world problems. As of 2011, 91% of Americans believed in God, according to a Gallup poll. Liberals demonstrated somewhat less faith than conservatives -- 85% compared to 98%. But when it comes to believing religion might help solve world issues, liberals are much less optimistic. Meanwhile, countless religious and faith-based groups around the world are working to prove that religion can be a force for positive change in the world. These organizations use faith as a tool for spreading messages of compassion and care, and they have steadily increased in their numbers over the years -- even as the belief in religion's ability to solve today's issues has decreased."
