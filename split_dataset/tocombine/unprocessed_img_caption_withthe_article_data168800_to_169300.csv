Fertility specialist, human rights activist, & social entrepre...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kate-middleton-hg_us_5b9c9594e4b03a1dcc800d38,"I wish Kate Middleton improved symptoms and an easier, safe pregnancy for her and her family. I also hope that someday all expecting women will experience the skilled care and concern that a duchess deserves.",2012-12-18,"Prince William and Kate Middleton pass St Salvator's halls, during a visit to St Andrews University.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c9594240000510053410c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Many admirers of the Kate Middleton were both happy to hear that she is pregnant and concerned about her health. Having treated many women with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), I imagine she is appreciative if not in a good mood to receive the well wishes of her many admirers.The symptoms and experience of severe HG are well described by Lisa Belkin on The Huffington Post. While HG occurs in a small minority of patients, the effects can be severe and long-lasting. Severe HG has been associated with prematurity and infants born small for their gestational age. These findings may have long-term consequences for an heir to the throne, including increased risk of heart disease. Other epidemiologic data has repeatedly pointed to higher rates of both twins and female infants, although the data are not strong enough to order either twin strollers or start painting the nursery pink.Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy is associated with a decreased risk of miscarriage, likely due to higher hormone levels, and most pregnant women experience some degree of nausea and vomiting. My personal preferred first-line treatment includes ginger (250mg, three to four times per day) and vitamin B6 (25mg three times per day). Both are safe supplements that have demonstrated effectiveness in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Taking a half pill of Unisom (doxylamine) results in some sedation but also helps with limited side effects. Unfortunately, Bedectin, an effective, delayed-release combination of Vitamin B6 and doxylamine fell victim to our litigious culture and was voluntarily pulled from the market due to litigation and unproven claims it caused birth defects. As a result, hospital admissions for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy increased by 37-50 percent in the ensuing three years.If symptoms require greater intervention, as in the case of the duchess, one can add medications with increasing amounts of side effects and costs. Hospitalization is typically a last resort for those with a 10-pound weight loss and electrolyte abnormalities. When the patient has as high a profile as the duchess, one must always wonder whether the hospital admission criteria were lessened, in favor of a more royal treatment.Regardless, I wish her improved symptoms and an easier, safe pregnancy for her and her family. I also hope that someday all expecting women will experience the skilled care and concern that a duchess deserves.For more by Dr. Peter Klatsky, click here.For more healthy living health news, click here."

A woman with a child looking out the window.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c96962200005700d94bf3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, a client came in and told me that she was relieved to have checked two of the four year-end holidays off her list -- Halloween and Thanksgiving -- and was now bracing for Christmas and New Year's. She expressed what many divorcing people feel this time of year: The holidays are a time to be endured rather than enjoyed. For lonely single people -- those not in a couple yet, or those newly out of a relationship or marriage -- the emphasis on pairing up and being part of a family at this time of year is excruciating. There's no way to avoid it, short of never going out of your house and not exposing yourself to any media (print, television or radio). It's not just ""happy family time,"" it's in-your-face happy family time,"" and anyone who wishes they had that happy family but doesn't can tell you that it's miserable. It can be two-and-a-half months of agony.But is there someing these people can do to make the season brighter and better? The answer is ""Yes,"" and there are also things people can do to make the holidays darker and worse. In fact, I'm often surprised to hear how much and how often people make choices that, from my vantage point, will predictably only bring pain.   Here are twelve ways people tend to make this time of year worse for themselves:1. They compare their ""insides"" to other people's ""outsides."" They tell themselves how incredibly happy all the couples are (not realizing that many of these people are simply putting on a happy face ""for the kids,"" and are planning to file at the end of January 2013.) 2. They go over and over in their minds about what a failure they are and all of the things they ""shoulda, coulda, woulda"" have done to still be part of their marriage and/or family (happy or not). 3. They hang around with couples and feel like the odd person out. 4. They subject themselves to people who shame them for being divorced. 5. They allow friends to tell them about things their ex has said and done (especially when there is a new person in their ex's life). 6. They pretend to be fine and don't ask for help. 7. They stay alone when they need to be with others and hang out with others when they need to be alone. 8. They don't take care of their basic physical needs like eating and sleeping enough. 9. They take on the pressures and attitudes of others in addition to their own. 10. They try to recreate old traditions that the single family unit used to do. 11. They cling to the past hurts and don't move past them. 12. They put everyone else's needs ahead of their own.  On the contrary, those who want to feel empowered this holiday season will want to employ these twelve tips:1. Own your holidays by doing exactly what you want to do. 2. Focus on where you are headed instead of where you have been. 3. Don't take on other people's feelings or opinions about your divorce.  4. Know that many of those people who look all shiny and happy now will be splitting up at the end of January (the time of year when there is a spike in filing of divorce papers). 5. Eat well and get plenty of rest and relaxation. 6. Have adequate (and often more than adequate) emotional support. 7. Journal (Refer to The Write Way to Heal From Divorce for more information) 8. Create a new community of people in a similar position or transition. 9. Allow yourself to experience your raw grief (don't make your feelings go away). 10. Look for the lesson -- what are you supposed to learn through this painful time? 11. Know there is another side to this period of your lives and increase your tolerance for delayed gratification. 12. Be resilient and roll with life's punches.With all the stress the holidays bring, you may not always be able to think and act as your most mature self. The good news is that if you are engaging in any of the twelve habits that will add pain to this holiday season, you can make some changes now and you may even end the year on a positive note."
2,TRAVEL,Bora Bora: So Good They Named It Twice,"Louise Roe, Contributor
TV presenter, fashion journalist, host of NBC's 'Fashion Star'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bora-bora-four-seasons-vacation_us_5b9c9ce6e4b03a1dcc804b56,"Yes, it's a tiring journey, but when you step onto the silky white sands and take a deep breath at the other end, it's beyond worth it.",2012-12-18,"Competitors take part in the 21st edition of the Hawaiki Nui outrigger canoe race in Bora Bora, French Polynesia on November 9, 2012. The race took place over 3 days connecting the islands of Huahine, Raiatea, Taha'a and Bora Bora. AFP PHOTO / GREGORY BOISSY (Photo credit should read GREGORY BOISSY/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c9ce6240000310053443a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The first thing that really made an impact on me when I first arrived in Bora Bora wasn't the vivid stripes of cobalt and turquoise water lapping against the island, nor the sweet, intoxicating smell of Tiare, a local flower decorating everything from the airport counters to local ladies' ears. It wasn't even the fact that we saw a giant turtle swimming by our water taxi from the airport to the Four Seasons. Nope. It was the fact that everyone here has got the most infectious giggle I've ever heard. Seriously, it was unbelievable -- the locals just do not stop laughing! They should rename this the Island of Laughter: if everyone visited, they could literally rid the world of depression because I've never been immersed into such happy, smiling people. So, this is a terrible admission for someone who claims to be pretty well-travelled to make, but when I first looked into heading down to Bora Bora, I didn't really know where, or what, it was. Except for the image of tropical islands surrounded by transparent azure waters and -- ahem -- I may have stumbled upon the drama-charged Keeping Up with the Kardashians episodes that took place there, I knew zip. A little research later, and I found out that Bora Bora is a spec of paradise nestled into a smorgasbord of French Polynesian islands, which cover a hefty area ¾ the size of Europe. Tahiti is perhaps the most famous of these South Pacific islands, but Bora Bora is the real gem in the crown. A sunken, inactive volcano created four million years ago, now encircled by a coral reef and tiny bumps of land, covered in lush green coconut palms and vivid red Tiare flowers, which -- when contrasted with the aquamarine lagoons -- makes you blink twice to take it all in. It doesn't quite seem real and there's certainly no need for colour-correction to improve the holiday photos.The journey isn't short, no matter where you're flying from. Air Tahiti, however, is a brilliant airline that somehow combines luxury with a very laid-back, island atmosphere. From LAX, we took a punctual nine-hour overnight flight, filled with happy couples and no businessmen (yay). The plane was decked out in ocean blue, there was a chic L'Occitane goodie bag on our seats, and the cabin smelled of vanilla -- another popular product of Tahiti. Staff were friendly, and by the time I'd snacked and napped, we'd landed in Papeete at 6 a.m. and ate our breakfast at the little airport whilst waiting for the short hour-long flight to Bora Bora. Yes, it's a tiring journey, but when you step onto the silky white sands and take a deep breath at the other end, it's beyond worth it.Warning: When you first enter your overwater suite, you will be speechless for a good few minutes. It's just mouthwateringly blissful. A little living room opens up onto a deck with steps down into the water. The rooms are filled with sunlight, the beds are enormous, the pillows are fluffy and there are various glass panels on the floor looking directly down at the fish underneath. Every now and again when a golf cart rides by on the pontoon, the floor does a little wobble, reminding you that you are indeed half a kilometer out at sea. It's like being on your own decadent yacht, with the luxury of room service just a phonecall away. (And PS -- the restaurants are lovely, but my favorite meals of the trip were room-service pizza and a bottle of wine under the stars out on the porch. So peaceful.) Any Four Seasons around the globe adheres to their meticulous levels of service, but what Bora Bora does well is temper that with the island's tranquil, relaxed attitude. Local culture, tradition and produce are interwoven everywhere you look around the resort's 54 acres: overwater bungalows are thatched with native pandanus leaves, woven by local craftsmen. Inside, walls are adorned with indigenous artwork. A weekly Tahitian beach party takes place, featuring local musicians; all four restaurants serve local fish and veg, plus beef imported from New Zealand -- which is tender as butter and practically local. Coconuts thrive on the island, both in the wild and in a nursery, and are used to make everything from cake, bread and massage oil, to cocktails or served straight up with a straw at the epic breakfast buffet. Guests can go deep-sea fishing on excursions inland, and take a guided snorkel with the hotel's in-house marine biologist. I started every morning off with a dive out of the bedroom and into the sea, followed by a paddle-board to the beach and a fresh coconut juice and omelet. Sure beats the usual commute to work!The spa deserves it's own paragraph as well. My other half and I had the Kahaia Haven Ritual, a couple's treatment that lasts three hours. It consists of a foot scrub and body scrub with a black pearl powder exfoliator, followed by a Polynesian massage with locally pressed coconut, vanilla or tiare-scented Monoi oil, then a facial and, finally, a coconut bath served up with a platter of fresh tropical fruit. Suffice to say it's the most balancing, nourishing and awesome experience ever. Taking place in an indoor-outdoor double room, all the senses are lulled into relaxation mode simultaneously: I listened to the waves gently lapping in the lagoon underneath, which you can see looking down through the massage headrest and down again through a window in the floor. Whilst my shoulder knots were pummeled, I watched shoals of needlefish dart about and one slightly scary sea-snake unravel from its underwater rock-side slumber. The warm breeze is filled with the sweet scent of vanilla, and then, at the end, you're just about ready to taste the delicious mango and melon brought in. I was so utterly relaxed I became a slobbering fool -- my second bout of speechlessness in as many days.My Four Seasons Bora Bora tips? Try the banana spring rolls with apple caramel sauce at the Sunset Bar. Indulge in at least one spa treatment, and ask for Siti -- she's the best. Order the scallops at the Arii Moana restaurant, they're melt-in-the-mouth delicious. Take a paddle-board out -- the ocean is so calm that it's easy no matter your ability or fitness level. Don't turn on the TV in your room. Read as much about the island's history as you can before you go, it enriches the experience tenfold. Wear a flower in your hair every day (that one's for the ladies). Hop on the free boat to the mainland to wander around. Don't shop in the first boutiques you come across, they are ridiculously overpriced, but keep walking to the supermarket and you'll find local Tiare oil, coconut soap and beach snacks for a bargain. Oh, and if you've got a spare $1 million in your pocket, the entire island, all 100 overwater villas, seven beachfront houses and four restaurants can be yours for the week, including meals, drinks and a spa treatment per guest. Hmm, let me just grab a quick lottery ticket..."

A chorus of books and movies tried to link the Mayan calendar to rumors of impending disasters ranging from rogue black holes and sun-storms to the idea that the Earth's magnetic field could 'flip' on that date. Archaeologists says there is no evidence the Maya ever made any such prophesy. (AP Photo/Israel Leal, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca0c31f00005000214c6d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The hour is upon us. This Friday at the stroke of solstice (4:12 a.m. Mountain Standard Time), the Maya Long Count calendar will click over to read ""13.0.0.0.0,"" (pronounced ""thirteen b'aktun"") for the first time in 5,125 years.The event has captured the world's curiosity and imagination, and this week, all eyes are on Mesoamerica: i.e. southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and parts of Honduras and El Salvador. That's where the Maya culture reigned during the Classic Period (about 200-900 A.D.) and where most of the 10 million or so living Maya reside today. So much attention being showered on the Maya people and their history, cosmology and culture presents an opportunity to ask a few questions.What is ""13 b'aktun""?A b'aktun is a period of 144,000 days (about 393 years) in the Long Count. It is an especially important unit, ""used for describing the creations of humans and of the world,"" as Guatemalan writer Gaspar Pedro González says. Some historians, looking at the historical record, have argued that there is a correlation between major world events and b'aktun endings.Thirteen is a sacred number for the Maya, so the completion of 13 b'aktuns, or 1,872,000 days, lends even more import to December 21, 2012. The fact that the Maya may have pegged this end date to a winter solstice (using only naked eye astronomy while taking precession into account, the earth's leapyear-causing wobble) is, for some, additional evidence of some kind of intention by the ancient Maya. Others are not so convinced and most (but not all) mainstream academic Mayanists say there is zero evidence of any intention or prophecy. So put down that survivalist manual, ignore Hodgman's advice to hoard urine and Mayonnaise and instead buy some books or maybe even plane tickets to a Maya country.The Maya Long CountThe Maya's observations of celestial cycles inspired a complex system of interlocking calendars of various lengths. Maya day-keepers, as their priests are known, built the cycles into a Long Count, or 5,125-year period of time, which they projected backward to begin on August 11, 3114 B.C. and forward to end on December 21, 2012. The Long Count is both calendar and historical record.The calculations were made at least 1,300 years ago in southern Mexico (perhaps even earlier by pre-Maya Olmec cultures). The dates were scrawled into stone stelae and temple walls, then lay hidden for many centuries and are still being unearthed and deciphered today. Entire books are dedicated to explaining the unique and complex base-20 Maya calendar system -- Barbara Tedlock's Time and the Highland Maya is a standard on the subject.Dr. Edwin Barnhart, Director of the Maya Exploration Center, writes about the Maya's affinity for ""calculating the lowest common multiples and highest common divisors between the celestial cycles they were tracking."" He says, ""I believe the Long Count allowed them to tease those temporal conjunctions out and that they viewed them as the hidden synchronicities of the cosmos.""But if the purpose of the Long Count was not to pinpoint a transition at its end, then what was it?John Major Jenkins, an independent researcher and author, thinks the answer is in the sky. He has written several books laying out the evidence for his galactic alignment theory, which states that the Maya selected 2012 as the end of their Long Count to correspond to future astronomical phenomena. His work is heavily based on the architecture, writing and layout of Izapa archaeological zone in southwest Chiapas, Mexico.Global Theories about 2012Within the multidisciplinary world of ""2012ology,"" theories span the gamut from serious academic discussions by glyph-deciphering Maya geeks to theorists who think that, on December 21, 2012, a magnetic phenomenon caused by the sun will trigger all human pineal glands to release a hallucinogen resulting in a mass humanity-wide acid trip.Other curious non-Maya-based theories predict Atlantis will rise, solar flares will explode and extraterrestrials will return to Earth to beam away the chosen ones (actually, this last one is supposed to happen in the village of Bugarach, France; seriously).2012: The Maya Prophecy DebateSome would simplify the 2012 debate as ""believers vs. non-believers,"" or ""those who think something will happen vs. those who don't."" The believers' side is a big tent, including talk of subtle harmonic energy elevations to collisions with asteroids, solar flares, extraterrestrials and Planet X.Most, but not all, academics and Maya scholars acknowledge that the Maya Long Count does indeed have an end-date that correlates to December 21, 2012. Except that it's not an ""end date"" and the Maya never said anything about a 2012 apocalypse. The date just played into their number games, say the skeptics -- in the same ballpark, in fact, as that cartoon with the Maya scribe, chisel in hand, who runs out of space on the tablet and says, ""That'll freak somebody out some day.""There is no doubt that the beginnings and endings of cycles were big news for the Classic Maya -- the bigger the cycle, the bigger the news. Some alarmists point hysterically to a particularly Armageddony line in the Popol Vuh, the sacred Maya book, which translates to something like, ""It will rain fire, burning stones; the Earth will lift up; there will be floods that will put an end to humanity, to those who have vitiated the Earth."" Though these events are not tied to 13 b'aktun or 2012 in the Popol Vuh, it's still tantalizing stuff, especially for custom bunker salesmen and the ever-present micro-population of our culture that always needs a coming apocalypse to hang to their gas masks on.The apocalypse stuff really annoys serious Mayanists. After the 2011 Maya Meetings in Austin, Texas, which addressed this discussion, Dr. Robert Sitler, author of The Living Maya, reported that ""the academic community has consistently described the international interest in the year 2012 and Mayan calendrics as a poorly informed product of misguided New Age ideologies with few substantive connections to the Mayan world."" He continued, ""Scholars are especially upset with extremist claims that 2012 will mark the end of the Mayan calendar and even the end of the world itself.""These thoughts are echoed in Mark Van Stone's book, 2012: Science and Prophecy of the Ancient Maya. ""There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy,"" he writes, ""to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012."" He argues that 13 b'aktuns was just another period-ending, and points to even longer counts at Palenque, including one indicating that 20 b'aktuns, not 13, is the actual length of the Long Count. Another text there has an inscribed date correlating to A.D. 4772, proving, says Van Stone, that the people of Palenque not only expected to survive 13.0.0.0.0 (December 21, 2012), but to worship their kings and gods for thousands of years after that.""This is about the clearest message they gave us,"" Van Stone says, ""that they (like us) could not imagine the End of their Culture, they expected it to live forever. Perhaps you could call this a static-cyclical conception of time. I call it normal human self-awareness.""What Do the Maya Say?As December 21, 2012 approaches, some communities in Mexico and Guatemala have sent delegations of Maya elders abroad to address global concerns about 2012. I attended one talk by a K'iche' elder in a community center outside Denver, Colorado, in 2011. He had come, he said, as a messenger from his grandfathers in the mountains of Guatemala with this message about 2012:""A better world is possible! That is my grano de maiz,"" my grain of corn, he said, ""as we enter the age of the fifth sun."" He told us about a school they were building in his village and of the ceremonies they were performing to prepare all of humanity for the upcoming transition.""You are invited,"" he told the crowd of about 200 people. ""The elders have opened the doors for whenever you'd like to come. Maya spirituality is for everyone. It is universal, it is not just for one group.""Dr. Jaime Awe, Director of Belize's Institute of Archaeology and part Maya himself, says that 2012 ""represents the ending of one cosmological cycle, and the beginning of another. It's very much the way most people would look at the end of one year and the beginning of another, but over a very, very long period of time. It is a time for reflection, and for considering future direction.""Another K'iche' elder, don Alejandro Cirilo Pérez Oxlaj, made this prediction: ""With a new social order there comes a time of freedom where we can move like the clouds, without limitations, without borders. We will travel like the birds, without the need for passports. We will travel like the rivers, all heading towards the same point...""Ways to learn more and connectI wasn't joking about those plane tickets. It's easy to fly to Cancun or Merida in Mexico, or to Belize City or Guatemala City, all of which are solid hubs for exploring Maya archaeological sites and modern Maya villages. Travel independently, or sign up with a Maya world tour specialist. Get out. Go slow. Talk to people. Hire a guide.

In compiling this list, we took a variety of characteristics into account, including versatility, culture, location, and budget-friendliness. If indoor shopping centers are more your scene, then head to Dallas, Houston, or Minneapolis; because we believe shopping is an experience meant to be savored, you won't find America's megamalls on our list.

Just keep in mind you won't be able to take in all of Tokyo's retail institutions in one trip. So, you'll have to pick and choose where you want to go according to your shopping style. For designer labels, you'll want to follow the neon lights to Ginza. Here you'll come across recognized brands like Chanel and Cartier, as well as massive department stores like Matsuya and Hankyu. Still haven't met your label quota?

And while it's easy to put your pocketbook to work on the elegant Champs-Élysées--where you'll find famous designers like Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Dior--you'll get more bang for your buck in the budget-friendly shops found in the Sixth Arrondissement's stylish St-Germain neighborhood. Here, you'll spot fashion-forward retailers like Des Petits Hauts, André, and Cyrillus. If you're looking for a piece of vintage couture heaven, head to the Upper Marais in the Third Arrondissement, where you'll find cutting-edge garments inside chic boutiques, like Merci. And there's plenty more than the eye can see happening below Paris' uber-trendy city blocks. If you've never been before, head to Les Halles, an underground mall filled with upscale stores and cafés.New York CityIt's probably no surprise that the Big Apple--which houses more than 8 million stylish city-dwellers within its five boroughs--has made our list of shopping hotspots. Flagship stores, bustling marketplaces, funky boutiques ... Manhattan boasts versatile shopping scenes that cater to fashion-forward shopaholics and chic New Yorkers alike.

For a more bohemian selection, head to Fitzroy, just north City Center, which teems with eclectic, funky boutiques, cozy cafés, and art galleries by the dozen. Or make a trip to Flinders Lane and Swanton Street, both of which house chic venues filled with Australian designer labels and fanciful accessories.[See: America's Best Shopping Streets]Santa FeNo, you won't stumble upon the exquisite designer stores like those featured on Fifth Avenue and Rodeo Drive. However, you will find Santa Fe's cobbled streets teeming with eccentric shops specializing in locally crafted items like silver jewelry, turquoise, and pottery. If you came here to gallery-hop, head to Canyon Road, where more than 100 galleries and studios display contemporary and abstract works from distinguished local artists. Along this premiere shopping street, you'll also spot hand-woven Navajo rugs and wood carvings galore. Afterwards, check out the vibrant Santa Fe Arcade, which oozes Southwestern charm from its rich array of silver souvenirs and festive eateries.LondonLondon's diverse mix of sprawling department stores, antiques-filled markets, and cutting-edge boutiques offer a pleasant experience for all. Whether you're looking for extravagant must-have items or marked-down merchandise, London has it. There's Harrods, the Knightsbridge landmark that teems with designer labels and elaborate window displays. And then there's Oxford Street, the vibrant shopping strip filled with popular clothing chains like Selfridges and TopShop. Prefer something a little more unique? Head to posh Soho, where eccentric (and high-fashion) pieces dangle from clothing racks. If you happen to be visiting over the weekend, make sure to stop at Portobello Road Market in Notting Hill: The usually peaceful street sees a flurry of activity on Sundays, when the area fills with vendors selling everything from antique silver teapots to retro vinyl.ChicagoAs its name aptly suggests, Chicago's ""Magnificent Mile"" features a brilliant mile-long stretch filled with top-notch boutiques and designer chains like Neiman Marcus, Chanel, Nordstrom, and more. For those of you looking for bargain-basement finds, you'll find less costly chains, like H&M, Filene's Basement, and Gap perched on the north end of Michigan Avenue. Prefer meandering through less-packed shopping enclaves? Venture to Bucktown and Wicker Park for antique-filled furniture shops, funky boutiques, and trendy art galleries. (Begin your journey on Damen Avenue and stroll north to Armitage Avenue for the top shops.) Just be prepared to leave with significantly depleted funds after hitting the racks here--the West Side may boast more bohemian shops than the Mag Mile, but the prices are just as steep.[See: 7 Reasons to Never Travel without a Credit Card]CopenhagenThis cosmopolitan city offers plenty in the way of supreme shopping blocks. For example, this is where you'll find Europe's longest pedestrian shopping street, Strøget, brimming with stylish boutiques and cafés. If you're planning on spending most of your time near the intersection of Kongens Nytorv and Nyhavn (the eastern end of Strøget's vast shopping network), pack a thick pocketbook: Here, high-end international brands like Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Chanel occupy a large portion of the sidewalks. Looking for bargains? Stroll toward City Hall Square, where you'll have access to numerous European chains, including Bik Bok and Vero Moda. Another bonus of shopping in Copenhagen: the sights. As you hit the racks, be sure to stop and look around every once in awhile to marvel at the majestic Stork Fountain (Storkespringvandet), Royal Danish Theater, and Christiansborg Palace.CharlestonIf your ideal shopping spree involves strolling along quaint streets peppered with antique shops, art galleries, and cutting-edge boutiques, then make a bee-line for Charleston. King Street stands as the artery of the city's retail scene, boasting a rich assortment of local high-end home décor stores (as well as larger chains, such as Pottery Barn). For the best antique outlets, head to lower King Street, between Broad and Market. Looking for fashion-forward brands? Take a stroll to middle King Street where national chains, like Banana Republic, reside. Looking to stretch your dollar further? Visit the Charleston City Market on South Market Street, which sells everything from hand-crafted pottery to paintings to woven sweetgrass baskets.DubaiMove over Las Vegas. In Dubai, everything is bigger and better, from the massive Dubai Mall to the bustling Gold and Spice Souks. In this Emirati metropolis (and major trading hub), you can find designer labels without the sticker-shock of American stores, thanks to tax-free price tags. Start your jaunt through the bustling bazaars for precious gems, Oriental silks, and savory spices--all for a much lower rate than they go for other parts of the world. Afterwards, work your way back to the world's largest shopping center, where more than 1,000 stores reside at the foot of the towering Burj Khalifa. And when you need a break for all the retail therapy, unwind by the Dubai Fountains, which feature an immense 900-foot-long pool.[In Pictures: Best Shopping Cities]"

Thousands of United Airlines passengers around the globe were delayed for hours Thursday, Nov. 15, 2012 after another massive computer outage hit the worldￂﾒs largest carrier. This is at least the third major computer outage for the Chicago-based airline since June. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c9c681f00002c00214a64.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like thousands of other loyal Continental elite flyers, I unwittingly became a United Airlines MileagePlus member at the beginning of this year, when the merger between the two carriers became official, and Continental ceased to exist. And, as I would imagine has been the case for many other former Continental flyers, my United experience has been less than enjoyable.It all started on my flight to Australia at the end of January. The terrible service and poor attitudes of the flight attendants notwithstanding, the flight was operated by a decrepit Boeing 747, which was falling apart -- quite literally in many ways.""I'm kind of shocked we made it,"" my seatmate joked, as we looked out the badly-scratched window to see the Sydney Opera House.As un-amused as I actually was -- I'd spent 100,000 of my hard-earned frequent flyer miles on my trip to Australia -- I held my tongue. Until I attempted to return, that is.You see, after nearly missing my flight in the first place due to a protracted check-in -- the newly-combined Continental-United computer systems were proving a mess for airport agents -- the push-back of the flight, operated by an even older, more decrepit 747, was delayed for over an hour.By the time we finally started our take-off roll, everyone on-board the plane was quite literally cheering. And then we stopped.""Customer service will be coming onboard to discuss compensation options as soon as we get back to the gate,"" the captain explained, after announcing that a problem with the flaps had prevented us from taking off.We sat at the gate for about an hour before the shaky-voiced gate agent came over the intercom -- we wouldn't be leaving Australia after all, it seemed. Not surprisingly, pandemonium soon erupted in the cabin. Many people were headed to Los Angeles for business, some of whom had only a couple days to work out their deals.Although I didn't have any pressing commitments in the United States, I was nonetheless annoyed, the memory of my terrible outbound flight to Australia still fresh in memory. When I finally did get back home after a return flight that wasn't, in the end, much better, I wrote United an email.I didn't expect to receive anything from the airline, having already been given a flight voucher and 10,000 frequently flyer miles, in addition to a hotel stay in Sydney the night of the cancellation. I was surprised not only to receive to more miles and another voucher, but also a personal response from the company's VP of customer service. It left a good taste in my mouth.Unfortunately, it didn't last long. A few months later, when I was about halfway through my summer trip through Europe, I learned that United had stopped serving the Moscow-Dulles route I was planning to fly to get home, and that I would instead be departing from Frankfurt, Germany. When I asked the United representative if there was any way for me to get a flight from Moscow to Frankfurt on another carrier, she replied that there was nothing she could do. For this and other reasons, I cancelled my trip to Russia outright.Unfortunately, just days after I did this, I received an email from United that, in fact, a Moscow-Frankfurt flight had been added to my itinerary. A follow-up call to United yielded the same sort of ""Sorry, you're screwed"" response, which eventually resulted in a cancellation of my flight which, according to the representative I spoke with, would be refunded on account of my extenuating circumstances.Or not. ""I'm sorry Sir,"" apologized a third representative, when I called a couple weeks after my would-be flight to inquire about the status of my refund, ""but refunds are not possible in this situation. I deeply regret the misinformation.""Fuming, I remembered that I had the email of the VP of customer service still in my digital Rolodex, and fired off a pointed, yet respectful message to him.Almost immediately, I received a response, albeit from one of the VP's associates, rather than himself. Just as her boss had done, the woman padded her apologies -- and the full refund I was promised -- with miles and money. And, just as had been the case in the wake of my return from Australia, I was pacified enough not to continue complaining.Until, that is, my little sister experienced unacceptable service on the flight to Bangkok I purchased for her as a surprise. (Among other offenses, a sassy flight attended flat-out skipped her when she had the nerve to ask for more information about the white wine being offered. ""I haven't got time for that, honey,"" he barked, as if he had some other commitment at 35,000 feet.)You can probably guess what happened next: I complained to United again; they threw more money and miles at me. But the next United flight I took a few weeks later was still terrible.Now, I realize I don't have an obligation to fly United, even if my elite status does afford me some very nice perks. I also realize that I should be thankful United did anything to assuage my dissatisfaction. And I am!But the fact remains that nearly a year after its merger with the impeccable (by comparison) Continental Airlines, United is still a hot mess, and no amount of apologies, cash money or free flights can change that.It is for this reason -- that air travelers need a place to publicly post reviews and opinions of airlines, so that airlines might actually address their problems, instead of paying passengers to shut up -- that I started BadAirline, a consumer advocacy website and blog I hope will have a positive impact on airline service, in spite of its negative name.Whether you want to congratulate or lambast an airline you've recently flown, head on over to BadAirline and make an airline complaint on the airline's report card. Or, subscribe to our airline news blog and keep abreast of the latest airline developments."

This is important work and we need to be skilled at it. But I would like every mom to take a few moments to focus on her own feelings today and to find ways to comfort herself during this terribly traumatic time.Let's start by acknowledging how vulnerable we feel in the wake of Sandy Hook. Even on a good day, parents spend energy, emotion and time worrying about what could happen to their child. On days like today, when we have been exposed to the worst that can happen, our hearts and minds are full of pain about what happened to moms like us -- moms who worry about their children's safety but who could never have imagined something this horrible.When my son and daughter were little, I obsessed about one of them finding a gun at an imaginary neighbor's house. I trained them on what to do if this happened -- don't touch, tell an adult -- and I asked them trick questions to see if they remembered.Years later, I watched a documentary about what really happens when carefully taught children find a gun. In the documentary, all the talk goes out of their heads as they get giddy over the reality of this dangerous weapon.My careful teaching and the truth of the documentary collided. I became aware that my fear of a neighbor's gun in the small, safe community where I had chosen to raise my children was symbolic of all the fears I felt for my children. My careful training -- don't touch, tell an adult -- was a symbol of all the millions of safety instructions I wanted them to know, remember and heed to protect themselves.We moms do so much to protect and keep our children safe. We are like walking encyclopedias of precautions and remedies. We are careful and vigilant. We have huge hearts to feel our children's pains and soft shoulders to comfort a crying child no matter how small the injury.Today, we need to turn our hearts inward to heal our own sadness. We need to talk mom-to-mom and comfort each other, to give each other a soft shoulder to cry on. Today, we need to remind ourselves that we are always vigilant and that we are protecting our children from harm every day. We need to let the music of the season soothe our souls. We need to acknowledge that we, too, need and deserve comforting."

There is simply nothing better than getting together with family and friends to share great food and traditions.  Still, like everyone else, I find that there are times when the stress of preparing for and hosting holiday parties takes away from some of the enjoyment. I try to make my life easier during the holidays by preparing as much as possible ahead of time and using shortcuts wherever I can.  Here are a few tactics that work for me to help reduce the stress so I can spend more time with family and friends:  Start preparations early. Write down the full menu, including everything from the main course to specialty drinks and dessert. To set yourself up for success, plan your menu around one star item and add a cast of supporting characters that are easy to make or can be prepped ahead of time.  Your star is your roasted beef tenderloin, baked ham or whatever your family tradition calls for. It will take a lot of prep and attention, so the supporting roles belong to simple but delicious appetizers that can be prepared ahead of time or in minutes. Foods that can be served at room temperature are a good option: for example, a red pepper or basil cheesecake can be made early in the morning and then set out as guests arrive. If you want to be adventurous and try a new dish, do a test run well in advance of your party so that you can make adjustments to the recipe beforehand.   Image courtesy of TargetSince my family is Italian, our holiday meals always include some sort of pasta dish. This year, I will be using my Gobetti Pasta to make Gobetti with Vegetable Bolognese, one of my favorite recipes. By using pre-made pasta, I'll be saving some time.  I like to include one menu item that requires last-minute prep. It brings everyone to the kitchen and sets the tone for a fun dinner party. To speed things up and avoid mishaps, I use cookware that goes right from the oven to the table like my own casserole dish.  Don't forget beverages! Wine brings out the flavor of many dishes, so take the time to select wines that complement the meal. Consider pairing each course with a different wine.  Remember, the host sets the tone for the whole night. If you are anxious, it makes it difficult for others to enjoy the dinner. Remember that the holidays are a time to celebrate with families, reminisce about past years and create new traditions. So, if something doesn't turn out exactly as planned, don't worry about it, it will make a great holiday story for next year.  Happy Holidays!"

The residents of an idyllic Connecticut town were reeling in horror from the massacre of 20 small children and six adults in one of the worst school shootings in US history. The heavily armed gunman shot dead 18 children inside Sandy Hook Elementary School, said Connecticut State Police spokesman Lieutenant Paul Vance. Two more died of their wounds in hospital. AFP PHOTO/DON EMMERT (Photo credit should read DON EMMERT/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca3a225000032003625e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Saturday morning, the feelings along the streets of Newtown, Conn. were conflicted -- there was sadness and love, fear and pride, uncertainty and pride. It was a testament to the complicated emotions of being human. There to help, to witness and report, I was quickly moved myself. As I made my way in from the outskirts of town, I spotted the Sandy Hook signpost and a bouquet of flowers someone had placed at its bottom. I thought: ""Nice touch."" But then again, they looked awfully lonely -- at once sweet, lovely and sad. I suddenly felt a sense of fear: fear of the emotions that I sensed would soon envelop me. Moments later, joining up with the larger community of people all working together to try to make quick sense of what had happened to this picture-perfect town just the day before, I was struck by what a phenomenal sense of community really means in action. It was immediately and viscerally evident, powerful, and had a life force all its own -- all in the face of the media glare and the invisible eye of the world tuning in. There was a pulse, a vitality, a strength, and a will to endure. There was a sense that no one need feel alone in Newtown on Saturday. As President Obama said to the nation and the world from Newtown last night: ""You are not alone."" I imagine he felt that in the fabric of the Newtown spirit. And he was right about that.When a shockingly-unfathomable loss of still unimaginable proportion strikes, our natural response can be to say or think: ""This is too much. I cannot comprehend this. I'm going to fall apart. I'm going to die."" This reaction -- that we all have to some extent -- may be initially lessened by the adaptive use of denial and minimization. ""This can't be,"" we tell ourselves. Inevitably, as we have come to expect, the greater outcry, the greater noise we are subjected to is intense and difficult to avoid. It is a very big tent under which we need to identify the strong emotions that ultimately help us navigate human experience. We went to bed devastated Friday night and woke up on Saturday angry and afraid. We want answers and solutions, and we want to believe that somehow there is a way to move forward. But how? The start is by avoiding the urge to isolate, focusing on reestablishing a sense of safety.Over the course of last Saturday in Newtown, I was over by two houses of worship, inside a diner, in the lobby of the middle school, where disaster relief counseling was underway, and alongside a park. I saw the familiar smiling and extraordinary comforting way everyone treated one another. It was with such grace, such courtesy and respect, with a genuine effort to understand and with a deep desire to help.Being open to receive this form of loving kindness is the first step of the healing process. Continuing to remain open is the next step, the ongoing challenge. Whatever helps us is the right way to go. Be it the connection with family or friends, religion or counseling, what matters most is to continue to return to being present and open to what is a very natural process that -- make no mistake about this -- is built in to our very essence. We have a gift: We are capable of recovering from overwhelming loss. We are capable of grieving. It is sometimes a very long process, but it does lead to a healing, a resolution. We mourn, we grieve and in the end, we are able to carry on and find meaning in our lives -- we are able to experience the full range of human emotions without feeling dominated by a single horrific and once overwhelming atrocity, though, of course, nothing will ever be the same as it once was.In my psychiatry practice, I see and treat suffering of this order all too often. It is a great privilege, and it can take a great deal out of me personally. I have to be mindful to take good care of myself as well -- to remain open to receiving loving kindness, to maintain a healthy routine, and to stay in contact with sources of support and understanding. Returning home early Sunday morning after such a long and draining day, I made time to stay up and talk with my wife and a few friends, despite the very late hour. I was very moved by what I had seen and heard and experienced: I needed to share. Then, I took to bed and surprised myself by really sleeping in -- for more than 12 hours. Everybody must take good care.For more by John Sharp, M.D., click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

The makeshift weapons were assembled from what the resourceful boys found where they were hiding: a key chain, a spring taken from a toy, and a screw found on the floor. In the storage room, behind file cabinets placed as fortifications to thwart the man trying to kill them, B and his classmates had just survived a massacre. When B put the handful of weapons back in his pocket I said, ""you're very brave love, but you don't need those anymore."" ""Of course I do Auntie Jen,"" he replied, ""now I'm prepared when the shooter man comes back."" When B asked how I knew that the shooter man wasn't coming back, I wish I could have answered, but I didn't. I looked at him, feeling defeated and unworthy of the title Auntie. I didn't want to tell the truth and I didn't want to lie, so I just stood there and waited for B's dad to come to the rescue, which he did. F and B discussed the number of schools in the country, the infrequency of this kind of shooting, and the ""less than one in a million odds"" that this would happen again in Sandy Hook. It was the language of mathematics that B understood, an approach many parents wouldn't take, but exactly the rational and honest answer that B needed.The tragedy I felt in that moment when B refused to part with his weapons was that I wanted to promise him something that would have been a lie. I wanted to tell B that there would be a great change, that in the future people like the shooter man would have access to mental health care instead of guns. But if I am honest, really honest, that isn't what I believe and I don't think B would have believed it either. In fact, he already seems to have normalized the shooting. To him it's not a nightmare -- it's a very sad, very scary but nonetheless very real event. Tragedy with precedent is not less tragic, but it offers the message that if life has continued for people in similar communities before, life will continue here as well. We live in a country where, sometimes, crazy people go into schools and kill children. Message I wanted to give B: It won't happen again. Lesson B actually learned: Be prepared.When B was reading before bed Saturday night, he heard that the President of the United States was coming to Sandy Hook. ""Why? The president doesn't usually come to town when these things happen... Why is he coming here to our town?"" The normalizing ""mechanism"" faltered for a moment because the president coming to Sandy Hook is something extraordinary, outside the scope of what B believed usually happens when shooter men go to schools. Of course it actually is normal for the president to pay a visit to communities who experience this kind of tragedy. And that may be the worst part -- that there is, in fact, anything normal at all about what has happened here. If nothing changes school shootings will become more ""normal"" (as B, tragically, thinks they are), and more towns spread across more states will be permanently stained, ever aware of the empty spaces left by devastated communities. Praying and public outpourings of grief may be meaningful sources of support, but they are not instruments of change. Law and policy, when applied to gun control, can be instruments of change, and it is time to step up. I'm on the outside looking in here in Sandy Hook; I'm not a parent and I haven't suffered a loss. But, I am also a part of a family that is trying to come to terms with an event that has permanently changed our lives. This family would rather see the world talking about how to protect children going forward than have to close their blinds to media who, in an effort to get a story, are spreading false information.I hope I'm wrong about the likelihood of change. I want to truthfully tell B that things will be different, that he will be safe because people won't have guns. But for now B's weapons are on the coffee table, still assembled and ready for when he might need them again.Please note: the author is not related to shooting victim of the same last name."

Only this time, even younger children -- not even young men, but innocents who would never come of age.President Obama, at the Newtown High School gym on Sunday evening, Dec. 16, 2012, said enough is enough -- with deep compassion and conviction. We can't tolerate more graves, and more consoling of families whose loved ones need not have died. What can we do to spare us all more grief, to let flowers grow in front yards and not graveyards?The Huffington Post ran a deeply chilling piece on the same day called ""I Am Adam Lanza's Mother: A Mom's Perspective On The Mental Illness Conversation In America."" It was written by Liza Long, the mother of a boy, who wrote:I am sharing this story because I am Adam Lanza's mother. I am Dylan Klebold's and Eric Harris's mother. I am James Holmes's mother. I am Jared Loughner's mother. I am Seung-Hui Cho's mother. And these boys -- and their mothers -- need help. In the wake of another horrific national tragedy ... it's time to talk about mental illness.This mother describes a bright but deeply troubled young man whose fuse is getting shorter and shorter. He threatens his mother with a knife, says he will kill himself if expectations are placed upon him, and assaults his mother when she tries to get him hospitalized for treatment of a mental illness. Like too many parents, her ordeal with mental health care is characterized by prohibitions detailing what cannot be done, and by services that seem to require a tragic event to allow for action to be taken.Much has been said about the delicate balance between patient rights and community (and family) safety, or the difficulty talking with someone in distress. (See some of my posts, ""Dying With Your Rights On: Mental Illness, Civil Rights and Saving Lives,"" ""The Enemy is Apathy,"" and ""'Random' Acts of Violence Are Not So Random."")But as our president now insists, enough is enough. The time for talk -- talk alone -- has passed. We don't need more deaths, be they mass murders or the deadly toll taken one person at a time: Though mental illness is, in Adam Lanza's case, currently unconfirmed, we need a way by which families can get assistance with their (and our) most vexing mental health problems. Why not start with developing a way by which families, mother and fathers, and siblings and children too, can have a place to turn -- as was so desperately needed, as we discover by reading this chilling story of a mother with a son who is at risk. These families with a seriously ill member need a place to turn, a means of assistance -- professional assistance and support -- rather than real and imagined legal, regulatory and professional prohibitions asserting what cannot be said or done to help them help their loved one.There are exceptionally capable family organizations, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) perhaps being the most accomplished advocacy group of parents, siblings and children, who could help in figuring out how to engineer and deliver the assistance they need. There are other organizations, including people with mental illness who themselves were almost CNN stories.We need to help families help their loved ones before more sorrowful flowers are watered by the blood of future victims.Dr. Sederer's book for families who have a member with a mental illness, The Family Guide to Mental Health Care, will be published by WW Norton in the spring of 2013.   www.askdrlloyd.com The opinions expressed here are solely mine as a psychiatrist and public health advocate.

Do it tonight.""  -The S.O.S. Band Taking money over time is a tenet of my faith. I believe in God, the Cincinnati Reds and not taking money in a lump sum.I've spent more than 30 years in the structured settlement business, encouraging people to take payments over time. Watching thousands of people blow through lump sum payments made me a true believer in the power of lifetime income.As I note in my new bestseller, ""Life Lessons from the Lottery: Protecting Your Money in a Scary World,"" 98 percent of lottery winners ignore my advice. Thus it is no surprise that most of them blow the money in five years or less. The same statistics holds true for people getting money from an injury settlement, inheritance or retirement. It doesn't make a difference if it is $10,000 lump sum or a $10 million lump sum. People blow through the money. It makes sense when you think about it. People are used to having money come in every month. Mortgages, utilities and almost every kind of bill payment are done monthly. People get paychecks on a bi-weekly or monthly basis. They get social security and defined benefit pension payments on a monthly basis.Thus, managing a lump sum is a completely foreign skill. As survey after survey shows, most people don't do well. Taking lottery payments over time allows you to adjust with the money coming in on a gradual basis. If you make mistakes and lose all your money the first few years, you have 24 more opportunities to get it right. I've watched several lottery winners become miniature version of Powerball Jack Whitaker and do silly things the first year or so. If they have a couple of years to adjust, they eventually settle down and enjoy the money. There are also some tax advantages to taking lottery money over time, as you are taxed on the money as you receive it. That may not be relevant with $100 million, as you are always going to be in the highest tax bracket, but a person who gets $1 million and takes $50,000 a year should be able to save. When I worked as a Series 7 registered representative (often referred to as a ""stockbroker""), I had a large clientele of doctors, lawyers and other well-educated professionals, along with injured people and the occasional lottery winner. I had my clients allocate their money into several types of investments and did my best to keep them from panicking when one class of investments did poorly. Over the years, I kept noticing one thing: People who had easy access to cash were the ones most likely to fall off the bandwagon. They would have ""emergencies,"" such as wanting to buy a new car, a houseboat or taking their friends on a cruise. Sooner or later, the money would be gone. In the meantime, I had a parallel business that provided structured settlement annuities to injured people. Structured settlements are only offered to injury victims and are tax-free. Thus, they are an attractive choice compared to taxable alternatives. A structured settlement annuity can be designed in a number of different ways, but the way I normally recommend is to pay it out over a person's lifetime, increasing at two or three percent a year to keep up with inflation and guaranteed for 30 years to a beneficiary in case the person dies. One of my first clients was a young man who lost his arms and legs in an accident and lived with a motorcycle gang. He received roughly $3 million. If he and the motorcycle gang had gotten their hands on $3 million dollars, they would have had the party to end all parties until the money was gone.I set him up so that he received $10,000 a month.Thus, they had a party every month up until he died many years later. You can't really ""cash in"" a structured settlement, although some people make the unfortunate decision to sell their payments to companies that heavily advertise daytime television shows such as Jerry Springer.Because the money was harder to access, the people who took structured settlements were more likely to have a stable and happy life than clients who could cash in a mutual fund or stock whenever they wanted.I realized the psychology was like dieting. I struggle with my weight and used to start a diet about once a month. If I start, but have all my favorite foods in the refrigerator, I will fall off the diet immediately. If I have to drive to the store about two miles away, I think about it more and sometimes won't go. If I have to drive 25 miles to get fatty foods, I am far more likely to stick to the diet. The financial analogy is that having all your money in a savings or checking account is like having food in the refrigerator. Putting money in a mutual fund or certificate of deposit, where it takes some effort (and sometimes penalties and tax consequences) to cash it in, is similar to driving to the store two miles away. A structured settlement is like the 25-mile drive for food. You have to do a lot of work to sell it and take a huge financial hit when you do. It is better just to hang onto the structured settlement and stay disciplined, just like it is better to stay on a diet. Eventually, I moved away from a successful career as a stockbroker and focused all my efforts on the structured settlement business.Although many of my eggs are in the structured settlement basket, it was closer to the Will Rogers' philosophy of being concerned about return of my money as opposed to return on my money. There is something similar to a structured settlement called an immediate annuity. It pays income for a person's life, just like a defined benefit pension plan. Although people seem to like lifetime income from a retirement plan, a Smart Money article stated what I long suspected: Few people buy them on their own.I never understood why until I read an article called ""The Annuity Puzzle"" in a June 2011 edition of the New York Times. Dr. Richard Thaler, a professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Chicago, discussed how purchasing an immediate annuity with 401k retirement money, with fixed and guaranteed benefits, was a simple and less risky option than self-managing a portfolio or having the people on Wall Street do it for you. He also noted that not enough people buy annuities. Thaler suggested that people seemed to consider an annuity a ""gamble"" that they would live to an old age instead of realizing that ""the decision to self-manage your retirement wealth is the risky one."" As people live longer than previous generations, they are more likely to run out of money before they run out of time on the earth.The biggest objection that I see to annuities is that people are afraid to tie up their money. Thaler confirmed what I had long suspected. People are much better off restricting access to their money than having full access. Another big objection has to be the crumbling faith of Americans in large institutions. In the book Eat, Pray, Love, author Elizabeth Gilbert references Luigi Barzini's The Italians in explaining why a country that has ""produced the greatest artistic, political and scientific minds of the ages"" has not become a world power.Barzini's conclusion is that after hundreds of years of corruption and exploitation by foreign dominators, Italians don't trust political leaders or big institutions. Gilbert said the prevailing thought is that ""because the world is so corrupted, misspoken, unstable, exaggerated and unfair, one should only trust what one can experience with one's own senses."" She added, ""In a world of disorder and disaster and fraud, only artistic excellence is incorruptible. Pleasure cannot be bargained down.""If the mindset of the United States becomes more like the Italians, the concept of thinking long-term will be harder and harder to achieve. An annuity is just one tool, just like balancing your money among a number of different investments, but the key to wealth is to develop good savings and spending habits. I've had a successful career in the structured settlement business, primarily because I believe so strongly in the concept. When I meet potential clients, they sense my passion and enthusiasm. Several years ago, I worked with a large number of people who were injured or killed in the same accident. About half of the people who received money took some of it as a structured settlement. The other half took money in a lump sum.I kept up with the group closely. The details of the settlements are confidential, but I don't think that anyone who received a lump sum still has any of it left. Most ran through it in a couple of years. The people who took the structured settlement are very happy. I keep in regular touch with some of them, and they frequently thank me. Not everyone agrees with Thaler about annuities. When Brett Arends was at the Wall Street Journal in 2008, he wrote a column titled ""Take the Money and Run."" He said that lottery winners should take the lump sum instead of annual payments. It was terrific advice for someone who lives in a vacuum or on a desert island. It was bad advice for lottery winners.Arends made some economic points. He said that taking the lump sum now would net more than normal. Many lotteries base their lump sum calculations on U.S. Treasury Bonds rates. Arends assumed that taxes will be higher in future years. It is a 50/50 guess. Anders noted that taking the lottery payments over 20 years would net a 5.7 percent rate of return. In a year when the stock market was in free fall and foreclosures everywhere, 5.7 percent doesn't sound so bad. Not to Anders. He had one word to describe it to describe the 20-year payout. ""Yuck."" This rate would look good to those who blew their lottery lump sum. Right now, they have zero. Anyone getting a guaranteed return of 5.7 percent in 2012 would be jumping for joy. The biography of Arends said that he had been living in London. He might have missed an American idea called dollar cost averaging. The concept is simple: Instead of dropping all your money in the market at once, you invest over time, like on a weekly or monthly basis. The returns are usually better than timing the market. Annual payments from the lottery set up perfectly for dollar cost averaging. If a person was smart and invested each year, the ultimate returns should not cause an observer to say ""Yuck.""Anyway, we have established that I am passionate about lifetime annuities."

The Vietnam War, with images of killing fields and the gruesome draft, was the reality of my younger years.Our generation of parents has been lucky; killer drafts have not touched our babies.But guns have.When my son was 16, we went to the local mall one Sunday afternoon to buy him jeans at the Gap. At the time, he had just gotten his learner's permit, so I reluctantly handed over the keys and off we went for the 20-minute drive to the mall.He carefully guided the car into a spot near the entrance to the mall where he didn't have to negotiate too many rows of parked cars. Easy in, easy out.Once in the mall, as we approached doors of the Gap we heard someone yell ""shooter!"". People started running frantically, all in one direction -- away from the sharp sound of gunshots. I made a snap decision to get the hell out of the mall. In a protective gesture, my son grabbed my hand and we ran through the mall as the stores locked down. I noticed there were holes in the new cars that lined the main isle of the mall -- bullet holes. Once we made it out to the parking lot, I almost lost it when I saw parents with babies and children hiding under parked cars. My son handed me the keys and I sped home.While we made it home safely, nothing was easy about the following days and nights. Bullets may have spared our flesh, but they grazed our psyches, leaving us raw and feeling profoundly unsafe.Officials stated the 24-year-old shooter had ""a ""lurid fascination"" with the 1999 Columbine shootings. Friends said he was ""dangerously disturbed... the gun was purchased at a local gun show.""Many of us are summoning up our experiences as parents, teachers, children and even gun owners as we try to make sense of the most horrific and senseless killing of beautiful innocent children.My heart has now moved from ache to anger as I read article after article addressing what Nicholas Kristof prescribes here: ""The fundamental reason kids are dying in massacres like this one is not that we have lunatics or criminals -- all countries have them -- but that we suffer from a political failure to regulate guns.""Politics is a messy business. It's easy to turn away from the ugly noise that has overcome our political system. It's easy to let someone else fight the insidious battles over power and money. But this is our fight as mothers, fathers, parents and citizens to protect children.We must demand that our children are safe from gun violence.Do you want your children asking their babies, ""How will I keep you safe at school, at the mall, in the playground, in the movie theatre, in our home...?""
