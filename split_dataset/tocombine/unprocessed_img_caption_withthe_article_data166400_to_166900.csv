0,WELLNESS,Extreme Breast Cancer Prevention: Should At-Risk Women Have Both Breasts Removed?,"Barron H. Lerner, Contributor

(Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images for USO of Metropolitan New York)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb69d2100003100c53c1a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The news that 24-year-old Allyn Rose, Miss District of Columbia in this year's Miss America competition, is planning to have both of her breasts removed in the near future is the latest case of what we might call ""extreme breast cancer prevention."" Rose's mother died of breast cancer, but she herself has no evidence of the disease -- nor do women her age often develop the disease.Just decades after women with breast cancer fought for and won the right to save their breasts, why is there such a spate of these prophylactic double mastectomies? Do they make sense from a scientific perspective, or are women choosing such surgery due to unwarranted fear and anxiety?In order to answer these questions, it is helpful to reflect on the history of breast cancer surgery. Well into the 1970s, surgeons routinely performed the disfiguring Halsted radical mastectomy -- developed in the late 19th century -- on their breast cancer patients. Women lost the cancerous breast, nearby lymph nodes and both chest wall muscles on the side of the cancer. Many felt ""mutilated."" Working with a few iconoclastic surgeons, feminist women -- such as journalist and breast cancer patient Rose Kushner -- questioned the science behind radical surgery and urged less-aggressive operations. Unfortunately, many of these overwhelmingly male surgeons reacted defensively, calling women who asked for more information ""silly and stubborn."" One termed breasts ""one of the most dispensable parts of the body."" [1]Ultimately, randomized controlled trials showed that for localized breast cancers, radical mastectomies were no better at saving lives than operations that merely removed the breast or those that only removed the cancer, providing radiation was later given. What these activist breast cancer patients had achieved was surely a feminist triumph. ""I think what I did was the highest level of women's liberation,"" wrote Babette Rosmond. ""I said 'No' to a group of doctors who told me 'You must sign this paper, you don't have to know what it's all about.'"" [2]But these activists were as much consumerists as feminists, interested in getting women to explore all options and make good choices. Kushner taught herself to read the medical literature and even reviewed grant applications for the National Cancer Institute. This mindset continues today through the National Breast Cancer Coalition's Project LEAD program, which trains laypeople to sit on scientific review committees.So women like Allyn Rose, who study factors such as their family history of breast cancer, whether or not they carry a genetic mutation that raises the chance of getting breast cancer and their various screening and treatment options, are following in this same tradition of being a good medical consumer. Rose's mother, grandmother and great aunt all died of breast cancer. ""If there's something that I can do to be proactive,"" Rose said, ""it might hurt my body, it might hurt my physical beauty, but I'm going to be alive."" Although prophylactic breast removal cannot remove all of a woman's breast tissue, studies show that it reduces the chances of developing breast cancer by more than 90 percent. Coincidentally, two family friends have recently undergone preventive double mastectomies. Amy, who is 40 years old and has a mother who survived breast cancer, chose this option when a mammogram revealed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), abnormal cells that may eventually develop into a cancer. Although Amy was offered minimal surgery and radiation, she was told that the DCIS could still come back. Ultimately deciding that the ""factory was broken,"" she had both breasts removed and is thrilled with her decision.Lisa had actually tried twice to have her DCIS removed but, in both instances, some abnormal cells remained. Although she might have had a third procedure and then supplemental radiation, she, too, chose to have both breast removed. She, as well as doctors, believed that additional procedures would have diminishing returns.It is hard not to applaud the choices of these three women as well as others who thoughtfully choose such drastic surgery to try to save their lives. Women with or at risk of breast cancer are among the savviest patients I see. In contrast to their peers in the 1970s, today's physicians go overboard in presenting a menu of options to such patients. Nevertheless, I believe that we should view preventive mastectomy -- at least for women without a clear genetic predisposition to breast cancer -- as a last-ditch measure. Just because a woman has a family history of breast cancer, it does not mean that she will get breast cancer. It is even less likely that she will die from the disease. Mammography is far from a perfect screening tool, but overall survival from breast cancer is 89 percent at five years, as high as it has ever been.There is an old expression among surgeons: ""Heal with steel."" That often happens. But before operating, we should always make sure that there is really something amiss that needs healing.References:1. Barron H.

The only thing worse than having an argument with someone in public is doing it in a charitable place like Habitat for Humanity. It's like yelling at a nun or cutting off an ambulance.",2013-01-13,"General view of christmas decorations on display, Birmingham",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9caa383c0000660009d991.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I belong to an organic produce cooperative. Every other week, I pick up a box of fruit and vegetables at the home of a woman who lives about seven minutes away. I like to take my 22-month old son, Eddie, because in her backyard, the woman has a rabbit in a cage. I usually grab my box of produce and pluck out two carrots: one for Eddie and one to him to feed the rabbit. Eddie usually winds up eating both.The woman lives two blocks from our local supermarket so I sometimes stop there on our way home, which is what I did the other day. But as often happens, while I went in for broccoli, I came out with a shopping cart full of groceries. About halfway through, Eddie's patience began to wane, and I started handing him things to buy myself a little more time. By the time we got to the register, there was a helium Santa balloon attached to our cart, Eddie was carrying a Sponge Bob candy cane, and he'd already finished off half a dozen strawberries, a red bell pepper and a coconut and chocolate granola bar. A smart woman would probably have taken the child straight home after that. Me, I'm a hopeless thrift store shopper, and my babysitter told me our local Habitat for Humanity store had Christmas decorations. I couldn't resist. I decided to stop there on our way home.The last time I was in Habitat for Humanity, a salesgirl scolded me for allowing Eddie to roam freely in the store. He likes to paw things, mostly glass things. The items don't cost much, but no one likes to hear glass shatter, even in a thrift store. This time, I made sure Eddie was close by. I kept handing him soft things, like little stuffed animals, thinking idle hands touch glass.As I scoured the bins for unique ornaments, Eddie sat on a couch reading a book about a Christmas tree. But he soon grew bored and got down and began to roam through the store. I quickly put down the ornaments I was holding and ran after him. I found another couch in front of a VHS machine that was playing Winnie the Pooh. I sat Eddie on the couch and I showed great enthusiasm for the video playing. Eddie began to watch. I stood there for about a minute to make sure he was sufficiently engaged. I then slipped off to do some more shopping. A minute later, I looked over and saw Eddie was standing over the VHS machine pressing all of the buttons until the tape popped out. By the time I got there, the carriage that ejects the tape was moving in and out of the machine like a cuckoo clock, and the tape was nowhere to be found.I tried carrying Eddie in my arms as I moved around the store, but he kept squirming to get down. I finally gave up on shopping and brought my basket of ornaments and a piece of fabric I'd found up to the register. There were two people already in line so I placed Eddie on the floor and put my basket on the counter. Eddie made a beeline for some glass ashtrays that were on a coffee table behind us. I ran after him. I tried to carry him back to the register, but he simply would not be carried, so I let him wander around the front of the store while I followed close behind. I kept glancing over at the register to see whether it was my turn to pay.After about 10 minutes, I picked Eddie up and walked over to the register to see why it was taking so long to reach my turn. I realized everyone had been cutting in front of me, presumably because I wasn't there to defend my rightful place in line. I turned to the woman who was now at the register and said, ""I was next.""""Oh, I'm sorry,"" she said in a flat, unapologetic as tone. ""Well, you weren't standing here.""""I wasn't standing here because I was chasing my child around the store so he wouldn't break anything,"" I said.""Oh. Well, I'm sorry about that,"" she said.She didn't sound sorry at all. And so I told her so. ""You don't sound sorry,"" I said.""Oh, I am. I have five children of my own. I know what it's like,"" she said. She continued to place her purchases on the counter in front of the cashier, with the hesitation of someone driving through a ""Yield"" sign.""Well, I can see you're very sympathetic,"" I said.Eddie was now squirming, trying to get out of my arms. I wasn't surprised. I was setting a fine example in the art of getting along with people.""You're obviously having a stressful day. I hope your day gets better,"" the woman said. Her tone was to sincerity what saccharine is to sugar.The woman had kinky blonde hair and wire-rimmed glasses and looked a bit weathered. I would loved to have written her off as a kook except her friend had just gotten in line behind me with a big pile of books, all of them great, literary choices -- the kind of choices only an educated person would make. I was disappointed. I figured if crazy was friends with someone with that kind of taste, she couldn't be a kook.By the time I got to the register, I felt like a pariah. The only thing worse than having an argument with someone in public is doing it in a charitable place like Habitat for Humanity. It's like yelling at a nun or cutting off an ambulance.The cashier began tallying up my purchases. I had about 25 ornaments, each priced differently, forcing the cashier to pick every one of them up, scan it for its price tag, and then ring it up. I was certain she hated me. She then lifted up the vinyl Christmas tablecloth I'd found. She opened it up and began looking on both sides of it for a price tag. She eventually asked me if I knew how much it was. I didn't.""Give it to her,"" said the store manager, who was standing next to the cashier. ""For having to wait so long.""Perhaps they didn't view me as a pariah, after all.Another woman behind the counter then asked if Eddie wanted a children's book. I asked if they had one about Hanukkah. She ran over to the book section and scanned the shelves but came back empty-handed.""I'm sorry,"" she said, but then handed Eddie a book about a Christmas tree that he'd not only seen already when he was sitting on the couch, but had torn the plastic fastener you could snap to hold the book closed. ""Oh, he liked that one,"" I said.I picked him up and grabbed my packages. As I approached the exit, the woman with the kinky blonde hair was standing at the door. ""Here, I'll get that for you,"" she said, stretching her arm out awkwardly to hold open the door.""Thank you,"" I said.As I walked out, our eyes met, and for a brief moment we both got a little teary-eyed, as we empathized about the frustrations of motherhood and felt bad about any hardship we had caused each other."

The park replaces human contact with mountains, glaciers, forests, waterfalls and lakes all perfect for hiking, climbing, fishing and good old-fashioned, non-masturbatory alone time.Kayak the Beagle Channel The rough, frigid waters of the Beagle Channel are often sailed, but jump in a lesser boat (like a kayak) to get closer to the wildlife here. Sea lions swim alongside your kayaks, the albatross circle appears overhead and penguins stand at attention on shore. You can navigate your seacraft through icebergs and watch giant ice chunks carve off glaciers into the channel. This waterway inspired Charles Darwin to start asking questions that, still to this day, piss off school boards across the Bible Belt.Climb the Martial Glacier Back in the day, this entire island was one monster glacier. But because you didn't listen to Al Gore, only a few chunks remain. Luckily, the Martial Glacier is just outside of Ushuaia and can be climbed in one good day hike. Bypass the ski lift that shuttles old people to the glacier's base and attack the steep hour-and-a-half trail on foot. From here, you can climb up and around the glacier to get postcard views of Ushuaia and the Beagle Channel. There are signs warning you not to do this without a guide, but let's just say you can't read Spanish, gringo. Best of all, the entire day is completely free.Go Even South-er You've come this far -- why stop now? Ushuaia is the main launching point for cruises to Antarctica and, although this trip may have a tough time fitting under your credit card limit, if you need this one last pin to stick into your world map, this is where you start. You'll cruise amongst whales, cut through massive icebergs, get pummelled by unforgiving waves on Zodiacs rafts, hike across jagged glaciers, march with penguin colonies and get chased by sea lions on this land that man has yet to fuck up. Seven countries claim territory on the uninhabited continent, so stick your own flag into the southern final frontier.This may not be the gaucho Argentina you're used to, but the unspoilt terrain of Patagonia -- all the way south to Tierra del Fuego -- will quickly teach you that Argentina's wilde side extends far beyond a porteño's hips on the dance floor.Written By: Brian Biros"

I imagined the demure Arab women in burqas with fabulous and elaborate eye makeup and Gucci shoes peeking out from beneath their floor-length garments. Well, I wasn't entirely wrong.First things first, of course there was no gold in the streets, but there are plenty of Ferraris, Porsches and Lamborghinis. The men and women mostly wear the same types of clothes that we do, but there are throngs of traditionalists, with men in ghutras (head scarves) and thobes (robes). I didn't see any burqas (head-to-toe body covering where no part of the body, not even eyes, are seen). But there were plenty of ladies in abayas (a loose-fitting neck-to-ankle garment) and hijabs (head scarves). Some of them also wore a niqab that would cover their face and mouth, but not their eyes. Also, the population of Dubai is heavily international. Less than 5 percent of the residents are natives, with the rest of population migrating from as far away as Eastern Europe and Africa to Saudi Arabia, India and Pakistan.The Royal Radisson was the home base of my Arab adventure. Occupying one of the twin Nassima Towers, the high-rise is a monument to creativity and modernism, evident in its decor and architecture. The view from my 33rd-floor room overlooked Sheikh Zayed Road -- a major artery in the Dubai traffic system. Skyscrapers covered the landscape near and far, but still there were undeveloped areas of desert, complete with a camel race track in the distance.To appreciate the splendor of Dubai is to first understand the history. There's a reason the city hasn't been on the mainstream radar until the past 10 years. The Emirate of Dubai as we know it didn't exist 50 years ago. Oil was not discovered until 1958, and it was found in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi. As recently as 1960, the people of the U.A.E. were riding camels and donkeys, and living in palm-leaf structures. When the oil was discovered under the reign of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, he felt that the wealth not only belonged to him, but to the people of his Emirates. Hailed as the father of the nation, Sheikh Zayed built roads, infrastructure, and began building the bubbling metropolis that exists today. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi has enough oil to last 150 years, while nearby Dubai only has enough to last 2.5 years, which is why it was designed to be more of a tourist attraction--the money needs to come from somewhere.And it's worked. People from around the globe flock to Dubai to shop, dine and experience a slice of the luxe life. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi is content to blush quietly in Dubai's long shadow of tourism, backstroking in the lucrative oil and gas business. On my trip, I visited both Emirates.Read about the rest of my Dubai and Abu Dhabi adventure and check out the photos and video on MyJetSetStyle.com."

They said I'd become addicted to Facebook and it was destroying my life and the lives of my family and friends. Of course I denied it. Me? Addicted to Facebook? No way. While they made their case, I was Facebook-chatting on my iPhone with a woman from Phoenix named Barbara, poking a hottie named Lana and commenting on a photo of somebody's banana bread. When I looked up, my family and friends were staring at me in a way that said, ""Put the damn thing down, asshole."" I asked them to smile so I could take a group photo of them and post it with the status entry, ""My Intervention.""I'll admit that my life changed after I joined Facebook but I wasn't addicted. I knew I could stop anytime I wanted. Granted, I was fired from my job as an air traffic controller because two Lear jets almost crashed when I was commenting on a post featuring a photo of a cute cat playing with a ball of yarn (my comment got three ""likes!""). I get such an incredible rush when I get a ""like.""Things continued to change, but it had nothing to do with Facebook. After getting fired, my wife kicked me out of the house because, during sex, I was posting a picture of some interesting-looking dirt, so I unfriended my wife and blocked her. I messaged her that I wanted a divorce. We'd had issues anyway, mainly because she never commented on my posts.I couldn't get another job and money grew scarce. I lost my house and emptied my 401(k). I kept my iPhone, but sold my laptop and iPad. How was I going to pay my phone bills? I freaked out -- no phone meant I'd have no Internet. How long could I endure that? I'd been told by one of the guys I lived with in the alley behind a Chinese restaurant that withdrawal was not a pretty sight. He said he once saw a guy writhing on the ground and yelling, ""I need a poke! Just one more poke!""To keep my Internet lifeline, I turned to robbery. Once, when I was hitting a 711, I accidentally shot myself in the leg because I was busy scrolling down the page, giving a ""like"" to very post, and my finger hit the trigger. I limped away, but I was bleeding badly, so I hobbled to a hospital, where I refused treatment because the surgeons wouldn't let me take my iPhone into the operating room so I could post a video of the doctors opening up my leg. That could've gotten at least thirty comments!Long story short, my family and friends put me in rehab. Of course, I had my iPhone hidden in my ass crack, but they found it and confiscated it.Every day, we sat in a room and told our stories, but we were not allowed to use the words ""post,"" ""comment,"" ""poke,"" ""friend,"" ""share,"" ""timeline"" or ""status."" Sometimes, a few of us would meet secretly and verbally post and comment on an imaginary Facebook feed until the orderlies caught us and disbanded the group. A guy named Bob was so desperate, he drew his timeline on a piece of paper and made a mouse out of clay in art therapy. When the orderlies took away his writing implements and prohibited him from sculpting, he tried to hang himself, but someone reminded him that he couldn't post a video of the suicide, so he took off the noose.Two months later, I was released. I felt like a new man. I would still have to attend Facebook Anonymous meetings every week, and I was not allowed to get the Facebook app, but that was okay. I got a sponsor named Dave who had started on MySpace as a teen before getting into the hard stuff. He kept me clean.I haven't gone on Facebook in a year. Whenever I am tempted, I speak to God.

JPMorgan’s board will weigh releasing an internal report this week that pins some of the fault for the bank’s “London Whale” trading loss earlier this year -- which cost the company more than $6.2 billion -- on Dimon, Bloomberg reports, citing “two people with direct knowledge of the matter.” What’s more, the board will likely cut Dimon’s bonus, the WSJ reports, citing “people close to the company.”The bank and each member of its board declined to comment to Bloomberg. Dimon declined to comment to the WSJ as did a JPMorgan spokesman.The report, which board members will decide whether to make public, also takes ex-CFO Doug Braunstein and former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew to task for their role in the loss, according to Bloomberg. Drew retired earlier this year in the wake of the scandal. Some British regulators are urging Dimon to keep the report private until they’ve reviewed it, according to the WSJ, but Dimon reportedly would rather take a more transparent approach.If Dimon’s bonus suffers from the London Whale loss, it could put him at risk of losing the title of best-paid banker. Dimon took home $23.1 million in total pay in 2011; that’s more than Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan’s $7 million and former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit’s $14.9 million, according to a separate Bloomberg report.The reports that Dimon will be faced to shoulder some of the blame for the loss come after the CEO criticized some of his executives for the way they acted in the wake of the news. “Instead of helping, they were running around with their head chopped off. 'What does this mean for me personally? How's my reputation?” Dimon told the audience at a conference earlier this month.The loss came from a complicated bet on credit derivatives made by Bruno Iskil, a trader known at the time as the “London Whale” who was working out of the London unit of the chief investment office. Iskil left JPMorgan in July and the bank took back about two years’ worth of his pay. "

After a difficult fiscal cliff battle, President Barack Obama said he would not negotiate over the debt ceiling, but Republicans have said they won't authorize an increase in the country’s spending limit without major spending cuts.""We should not allow this to become thought of as a legitimate or normal budget strategy,"" Krugman said on ABC's ""This Week."" “This is hostage taking.”Krugman has made similar statements in the past, particularly when defending the idea of minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin to avoid the debt ceiling crisis -- a loophole the White House ruled out Saturday. In a blog post earlier this month, Krugman argued that Obama should be ready to mint the coin because it offered a “silly, but benign” solution to the crisis. The alternative: Putting the nation’s ability to meet its financial obligations at risk, an option that Krugman described as “both vile and disastrous.”“The debt ceiling is a fundamentally stupid but dangerous thing,” Krugman said on ""This Week."" “It’s incredibly scary, this is much scarier than the fiscal cliff,” he added later.If Congress does nothing to raise the debt ceiling, the U.S. could lose its ability to meet its financial obligations by as early as February 15, according to a recent report from the Bipartisan Policy Center. Republican leaders and the White House came to an agreement earlier this month to address the so-called fiscal cliff, a combination of tax increases and spending cuts that economists warned could have plunged the country into recession.

The 46-year-old, sometimes referred to as the longest-serving woman in the video game arena, jokes that these days one can even encounter long lines for the ladies' room at the Game Developers Conference, one of the industry's largest gatherings.""Over the years, greatly helped by the social and mobile boom, there have been many, many women coming into game development,"" Brathwaite Romero said.With women comprising just over 1 in 10 in the video game workforce, the industry has a reputation for being among the most testosterone-fueled of the traditionally male-dominated technology sector. But thanks to the mobile revolution, industry executives say that's changing.With smartphones going mainstream and delivering gaming to a new, broader population, publishers and developers are keen to tap an audience beyond young males. And, not surprisingly, as women have explored a growing range of mobile games on Facebook or other platforms, they have discovered the allure of working in the industry.The number of women hired by game companies has tripled since 2009, according to recruiting firm VonChurch, based on over 350 placements it has made in digital gaming firms like CrowdStar and GREE.In 1989, when veteran games designer Sheri Graner Ray started out, women made up less than 3 percent of the workforce. That's now up to 11 percent.""In 20 years, it's not a lot of growth,"" said Graner Ray, who has worked at leading companies like Electronic Arts and Sony Online Entertainment. But she agrees that number will rise as more women assert themselves in the industry, educational programs take hold, and mobile games continue to flourish.Some of the first engineers at mobile games maker Pocket Gems were women, and though that wasn't intentional when the company was founded in 2009, it proved instrumental to success, said Chief Executive Ben Liu.Pocket Gems, best known as a maker of family-friendly mobile games like its popular ""Tap"" series, recently launched ""Campus Life"", where players can build and run a college sorority, to target a female audience.""I've worked at other, different game companies and I've been on floors where it's only guys,"" Liu said. ""Our aspiration is to create games that are mass market and accessible to all people, and having that representative base of employees helps us keep true to that.""DEBAUCHERY 'WAY, WAY DOWN'Gaming still conjures up images of young men glued to flickering screens for hours on end, fueled by energy drinks and waging online battles unto death in such ""shooters"" as ""Call of Duty"" or tactical war games like ""Starcraft.""But the advent of affordable smartphones and tablets and the burgeoning world of social media has drawn in a whole new world of gamers. Individuals who had never been tempted to plunk down hundreds of dollars to buy a gaming console found themselves enticed by a whole new genre of games.These days, gaming might just as easily mean launching attacks on pigs in ""Angry Birds"" or slicing produce with swiping motions in ""Fruit Ninja"" -- games that have mass appeal.""Mobile is still the Wild West and it's founded on this idea of inclusion, because everyone has these mobile devices and everyone wants to play,"" said game content designer Elizabeth Sampat, who works at social game company Storm8.That's partly why more than half of America's social and mobile gamers are women, according to research firm EEDAR, while they comprise just 30 percent of those who play hard-core violent games like Microsoft's ""Halo 4"" on game consoles.Erin McCarty, 24, grew up playing such fare. She went to engineering school at Carnegie Mellon University, with a goal toward working in the video game industry.Today she's the only female engineer in a seven-member team crafting multiplayer-shooter game ""Realm of the Mad God"" at social and mobile game company Kabam that targets male gamers.But far from feeling different, McCarty considers herself just another coder at Kabam, where women make up just a fifth of the payroll.""I'm around guys a lot and they are always people that I'm happy to work with,"" McCarty said.Brathwaite Romero recalls how her male coworkers on the team that created the mature-rated ""Playboy: The Mansion"" game with nude characters that was published in 2005, were wholly professional.""I've fortunately not experienced the level of misogyny that I've heard other people experience,"" Brathwaite Romero said.""Some of the debauchery that was evident in the early days of the industry, like meetings at strip clubs, having strippers at your party, that sort of stuff has gone down way, way down from where it used to be.""DANCING GIRLS AND SEXISMThat's not to say the industry doesn't have a ways to go.First, there's a 27 percent gap in average incomes, with women making $68,062 versus men at $86,418, according to Game Developer Magazine's 2011 annual salary survey.Women in the game industry are underrepresented in software engineering and top-level management, reflecting a similar trend in the broader technology sector, industry executives say.VonChurch found engineering positions were skewed more toward men in their placements since 2009. Female engineers made up 21 percent from the pool of women it placed, while over half of the men it placed were hired in engineering positions.Then there are the occasional throwbacks to the male-dominated 1980s and 1990s. Gameloft created a stir a few weeks ago after a holiday party at its Montreal studio ran amok.The studio, which makes games for devices like Apple Inc's iPhone, hired a burlesque dance troupe that featured scantily clad women in body paint. By the end of the evening, several dancers began to discard their bathing suits, according to a person with knowledge of the event, who asked not be named.The dancers were expelled from the event ""as soon as their misconduct was brought to light,"" Gameloft said in a statement.Over a month ago, a tweet from a male gaming professional -- ""Why are there so few women in gaming?"" -- ignited a top-trending Twitter conversation under the #1reasonwhy hashtag, that quickly morphed into a now infamous discussion of discrimination and sexism in the workplace.""I was told I'd be remembered not on my own merits, but by who I was or was assumed to be sleeping with,"" Seattle-based pen and paper game designer Lillian Cohen-Moore, who goes by @lilyorit, tweeted.Gaming conventions can bring out the worst in attendees, said several women gaming professionals. While not a pure work environment, they are a forum for professionals from across the industry to convene to talk shop and do business.Cohen-Moore, 28, said she was appalled to see men at the annual Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle groping women working as costumed characters when she worked there last year.""I've been leery about transitioning into video games because the culture over there is a lot more blatant and active in how many sex trolls they have,"" she said.Brathwaite Romero, who is married to industry legend and ""Doom"" creator John Romero, also recounts a jarring instance at last summer's Electronic Entertainment Expo, the industry's biggest gathering.""I was discussing a potential contract with somebody and the guy right next to me is talking about -- to quote him -- 'the tits and ass' on this particular model. And he's going on and on and on about this,"" she said. ""This is wrong.""Sampat said in some workplaces, though not at her current employer Storm8, women are often expected to tolerate off-color jokes - of which they're often the target.Before stepping into an interview at an online game company a couple of years ago, Sampat said a female human resources employee told her: ""It's my job to make sure that all potential candidates can, you know, take a joke.""""I couldn't help but wonder if she asked the white male programmer who came in before me whether he could take a joke too,"" Sampat said.Women outside the United States find similar challenges. Alisa Chumachenko, CEO and founder of Game Insight, a fast-growing mobile and social company in Russia, thinks having more women in senior and more diverse roles will help. Her company of 450 employees has three other women in high-level positions, but she wishes she knew more women in gaming.""We need to really look at the women who have become movers and shakers in this industry,"" the veteran games designer Graner Ray said, ""and claim them and hold them up and say: 'Here's where we are, here's what we can do. Pay attention to us.'""(Editing by Edwin Chan and Leslie Adler)"

Swartz, who committed suicide Friday, faced charges for attempting to publicly release academic papers from the digital library JSTOR, which potentially could have sent him to jail for more than 35 years if he were convicted. In a statement, Swartz's family blamed the intensity of the charges for contributing in part to his suicide. By Sunday morning, hundreds of academics had begun tweeting links to their copyright-protected research as a protest in Swartz's honor, using the hastag #pdftribute. Links scraped from Twitter posts featuring the hastag are being aggregated at Pdftribute.net.

Swartz, who committed suicide Friday, faced charges for attempting to publicly release academic papers from the digital library JSTOR, which potentially could have sent him to jail for more than 35 years if he were convicted. In a statement, Swartz's family blamed the intensity of the charges for contributing in part to his suicide. By Sunday morning, hundreds of academics had begun tweeting links to their copyright-protected research as a protest in Swartz's honor, using the hastag #pdftribute.

There is time enough for that. Today I just want to talk about fact checking. The Journal editorial board is egregious in its misuse of data. It writes what it wants without fact checking. Where is the journalistic profession to call them out?There are two editorial pieces this weekend of note. The story on ""Europe's Bankrupt Welfare State"" asserts that, ""the European way of welfare is bankrupt."" This is easy to check. Look at European countries with large welfare states, and see how they are doing in terms of debt, deficits, unemployment, and other indicators of ""bankruptcy."" I do this in Table 1 here comparing the U.S. with Europe's five leading welfare states: the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Germany. For all six countries, I use the IMF data easily available on http://www.imf.org. The IMF reports data on key macroeconomic variables. I chose the estimated data for the year 2012, which is still preliminary. One can just as easily use the data for 2010 or 2011 and find the same results. The IMF reports fiscal and debt data for ""general government,"" meaning the combination of federal, state, and local levels. That is handy, as it enables comparisons across countries without distortions by the level of government or fiscal-federal definitions and practices. Looking at Table 1, the conclusion is simple. The European welfare states tax and spend more than the US as a percent of GDP, yet also have lower budget deficits as a share of GDP, lower debt-GDP ratios, and lower unemployment rates. Note that the government sectors of Norway and Sweden have net assets rather than net debt. Some bankruptcy! The second comment is by editorial board member Holman Jenkins, Jr. Mr. Jenkins tries to debunk global warming by writing that ""the warmest year on record globally is still 1998 and no trend has been apparent globally since then."" His claim is both false and irrelevant. It is false because most data point to more recent years as being warmer than 1998. (For the National Climatic Data Center, for example, 1998 comes in third, behind 2005 and 2010.)The claim is also irrelevant, since 1998 was an exceptionally strong El Nino (essentially, a tilt of Pacific warm water towards the west coast of Latin America). The El Nino made 1998 an exceptionally warm year both because of El Nino and because of long-term human-induced global warming. Comparing subsequent years to a very strong El Nino year mixes up trends and inter-annual variability. It's not hard to strip away the El-Nino fluctuations (since the El Nino -- Southern Oscillation is directly observable independent of global temperatures) to get a sense of the underlying global temperature trends. There is no doubt that the temperatures of the recent 10 years have been among the hottest of the entire climate record. These years are much warmer than in earlier decades, even if temperatures have jumped around year to year as one would expect. The long-term trend is clear. The Wall Street Journal editors have failed to notice that even the climate skeptics have come around. Interested readers might look at the reports of one such skeptic, Professor Richard Muller, physicist at Berkeley, whose team recently re-analyzed the global climate record in very great detail. They summarized their main conclusions as follows: ""Berkeley Earth has just released analysis of land-surface temperature records going back 250 years, about 100 years further than previous studies. The analysis shows that the rise in average world land temperature globe is approximately 1.5 degrees C in the past 250 years, and about 0.9 degrees in the past 50 years.""And:""Many of the changes in land-surface temperature can be explained by a combination of volcanoes and a proxy for human greenhouse gas emissions. Solar variation does not seem to impact the temperature trend.""See the results of the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Project, here.  The Wall Street Journal editorial board needs a fact checker plain and simple. It's a major paper, with excellent news coverage, and should not destroy its integrity by an editorial board that flouts the basic process of checking the facts."

Recently this was clearly the case whereby the New York Times elected to regale its readership by twice publishing a screed fulminating against the construct of the contemporary art world.The New York Times, in a blatant editorial election, contrived to use its banner of influence to revile contemporary art by flagging in two separate editions the same letter parading the moth-eaten defamations of the contemporary art world.First, in the letters to the editor column on January 1, 2013 and then with much fanfare, over again, in the January 6th Sunday Review section's 'Sunday Dialogue' page.Taking issue with the Times' machinations, the following letter to the editor was emailed by this writer. To the Editor:(Needless to say the letter never reached the light of day in its august pages.)For those not familiar with Hilton Kramer, he was the acerbic often brilliant chief art critic of the New York Times who had preference for bucolic landscapes and who militated for years against all that was new, edgy, difficult and personally revealing in the plastic arts. His hectoring was also instrumental during my tenure, many years ago, on the National Council of the National Endowment for the Arts, in terminating the Endowment's Critics Fellowship Program that awarded minuscule but highly meaningful stipends to critics to help hone their skills. A significant loss to the field and the nation.It is a blessing that the current line-up of critics of the New York Times' arts section is extraordinarily talented, professional and unencumbered. One can only hope that the editorial page's meanderings on this issue are but a transitory aberration."
