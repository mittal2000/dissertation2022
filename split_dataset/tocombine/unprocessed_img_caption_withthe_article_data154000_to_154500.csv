Despite being a massive hit with children and adults alike, German lawmakers want to ban Kinder surprise eggs on safety grounds, press reports said on August 7, 2008. AFP PHOTO DDP/MARTIN OESER GERMANY OUT (Photo credit should read MARTIN OESER/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2fa8240000510094f9f0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you're American, you may not be familiar with Kinder Surprise eggs, an Italian candy product that is not sold in the U.S. because of a 1938 law prohibiting putting non-edible things inside of food.Or maybe you recently discovered these eggs through the powerful and viral anti-gun campaign run by Moms Demand Action:Kinder Surprise eggs target the 5-10 age range, I'm guessing, based on the kinds of toys that are in them. I grew up with toys in cereal boxes and Cracker Jacks. It's part of being a kid! My little brother and I would choose our breakfast cereal based on what the ""free-inside"" was. One day, when I was 7, I was sure I'd seen a fairy disappear into my room's heating vent just as I woke up. And, that morning, I got two free-insides in my cereal! I knew it was the fairy's doing...Now I live in France, where you can always find Kinder Surprise eggs just before the register at the grocery store, in the impulse-buy zone, and just where you're likely to wish for something to placate your antsy little kid for a bit while you wait in line. That's where I was when I saw the pink boxes covered with pictures of tiny fairies from Winx Club, an Italian cartoon series I'd never heard of. They looked cute, and I grabbed one. On impulse. As promised by the name, I was surprised. Once I got home and saw the fairy up close, I knew that if I'd had a little girl at home, there is no way on earth I would have bought one. Even if she'd pitched a tantrum on this scale in the store.There is something very, very wrong with this picture. I probably don't even have to say what it is. But I will, just in case you've been on another planet. They're too skinny, their proportions are unnatural and they're way too sexy. And no normal girl can bend her back or her hips like that. These poor fairies have severe scoliosis or something. It looks painful.There's a sickening trend towards sexualization of girls in toys and entertainment. And there's a long-term issue, going back to Barbie's youth, with presenting girls with unhealthy and unrealistic physical ideals through toys and entertainment intended for them. This April 2013 article in The Atlantic sums up these issues nicely. And, since this article appeared, there has been yet another controversy surrounding the addition of Merida, the girl heroine of Disney's Brave, to the Disney princess line-up. After cinching in her waist, slapping some make-up on her face, lowering her neckline, and more, of course. Because the destiny of all spunky young women is to grow up to be decorative princesses.(Of course, every male action figure that a boy sees in his life looks like someone's ideal of male physical perfection, and there's no doubt this takes its toll on little boys too. Not to mention that action figures are almost always associated with violence. So for boys, there's an unrealistic physical expectation and an expectation/endorsement of violence inherent in their toys... People don't talk nearly enough about this issue, if you ask me. I raised a son.)I asked the 19-year-old daughter of a friend what her impressions were of these fairies. This young woman, a mechanical engineering student at Boston University, could be the model for the fairy in the blue skirt (but with realistic proportions, no scoliosis and more class). Her first response, like mine, was ""Cute!"" Then I pointed out that they were for very young girls, and told her I was planning to write about the sexualization of girls' toys. She mentioned the Atlantic article I link to above, and told me how things had changed since she was small. (Oh-so-long ago.)For example, she said that when she was very young, her dance class performed ""Puff the Magic Dragon,"" and the little girls were dressed in ""puffy little"" dragon suits. She tells me little girls performing it now are dressed in frilly green skirts and v-necked leotards. In her opinion, the ""Toddlers and Tiaras"" phenomenon may be partly responsible. She says that her dance clothes in general consisted of unitards and simple skirts, but that the clothes girls are wearing now look like ice-skating costumes.My friend's daughter, whom I've known since she was two months old, was visiting me here in Paris because she's spending a semester in Germany and she had a long weekend. I took advantage of her presence to ask her to try to pose like the fairies. Try as she might, lean and limber as she is, she couldn't twist her body into any of these positions. Gee. Makes you think. Or at least it should.So, what can we do about the exploitation of children by the greedy makers of toys and kids' entertainment? Amy Jussel, of Shaping Youth suggests,We need to start asking bigger, tougher, hardball questions; look deeper into the effects of playing with thin dolls on body image and food intake in young girls for example, or the increase of sexual assault, dating violence and ""rape culture"" with social norming of misogynistic media, hyper masculine toys and monstrous marketing messages.All that and, of course, just don't buy it."
5,WELLNESS,Pfizer Takes Its Shot At A Vaccine For Evasive MRSA Superbug,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pfizer-vaccine-mrsa-superbug_us_5b9d2fa8e4b03a1dcc855338,GlaxoSmithKline has been quiet about its approach. The drugmaker had been partnering with Nabi's failed StaphVax candidate,2013-05-23,"Scanning electron micrograph of MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2fa82200008300d9874e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO, May 23 (Reuters) - Kathrin Jansen is a microbiologist with at least two breakthrough vaccines to her name: she brought the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil to market for Merck and helped develop the $4 billion a year pneumonia and meningitis vaccine Prevnar 13 for Pfizer.Jansen's next vaccine success could come by taming the superbug MRSA, a drug-resistant bacterium that she has seen ravage a healthy man up close and personally.Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infects an estimated 53 million people globally and costs more than $20 billion a year to treat. In the United States alone, MRSA kills 20,000 Americans each year, exceeding annual deaths from AIDS.Jansen watched the infection unfold two years ago when visiting her stepfather, who was in the hospital for a hip replacement. The man in the bed next door died soon after MRSA attacked the vascular graft in his leg.""He went in healthy and died very quickly,"" recalls Jansen, senior vice president of vaccine research and early development at Pfizer Inc, the world's largest drug maker. She says the experience steeled her resolve to develop an effective vaccine that could prevent such deaths.But Staphylococcus aureus has proven a tenacious adversary. In the past decade, vaccine candidates by Nabi Biopharmaceuticals and Merck & Co Inc failed in costly, late-stage clinical trials. Now, led by Jansen, Pfizer is taking a shot. Competitors, including vaccine giants GlaxoSmithKline , Novartis and Sanofi, are, too.And while the race could lead to a viable vaccine, potentially worth billions in sales, critics say companies may be risking costly failure with so much work on a bacterium that is still barely understood. 'BAG OF TROUBLE'Staph has been living in and on its human hosts for centuries. At any given time, 25 to 35 percent of individuals will test positive for staph, often with no symptoms. But the bacterium can cause a range of diseases from boils and impetigo to raging blood infections and deadly bacterial pneumonia.The discovery of penicillin in 1928 gave doctors a way to defeat staph infections, but overuse and misuse gave rise to drug-resistant staph. Methicillin was developed to overcome drug-resistance, but by the 1960s, staph evolved new defenses to overcome this more powerful version of penicillin.Thus began the decades-long battle against methicillin-resistant staph, now the most common cause of hospital-acquired infections that is increasingly spreading into army barracks, prisons and daycare centers.Dr. Bill Gruber, a Pfizer senior vice president who led clinical trials for Prevnar 13 and is running the company's Staph aureus trials, thinks of the bacterium as ""a little bag of trouble.""""Basically, it has a number of different toxins and defenses to try to defeat you.""That may explain why vaccines from Nabi and Merck failed. Both tried to defeat this bug by attacking on just one front.The vaccine by Nabi, now Biota Pharmaceuticals, focused only on the sugar capsule the bacteria make to hide from the immune system, while Merck's focused on a single protein that helps staph gets its nutrition. Neither lived up to expectations.""We've learned that just focusing on one target of Staph aureus might not be sufficient,"" said Dr. Buddy Creech, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. IT TAKES STAMINAJansen has been working on a Staph aureus vaccine for the past decade, first at Merck, then at Wyeth, and now at Pfizer.The East German-born scientist - who fled to the West in 1960 and earned her PhD in biology at Philipps University in Marburg - says it takes stamina to develop a successful vaccine, a process that can take 15 years or more. With the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil, which had 2012 sales of $1.6 billion, it took 14 years from lab bench to government approval. ""That's actually a fast development program,"" she said.With Staph aureus, it took eight years from the first experiments to human safety trials. Now, it could take another seven to 10 years to wind up clinical trials, putting the team about midway through the process.Pfizer's initial vaccine targeted three mechanisms key to staph's survival and ability to cause disease. Two of those focused on sugar capsules. The third attacks a mechanism called ""clumping factor,"" which allows bacteria to stick to proteins when they enter the body.But Jansen's team wanted one more point of attack. They added a fourth antigen, a protein that allows the bacterium to steal manganese - a key nutrient - from host cells.The result is a four-antigen vaccine that generates antibody responses at distinct points of the life cycle of the bug. The company is testing this in Phase 1/Phase 2 trials in healthy adults in the United States.If Pfizer gets the results they hope for, likely later this year, the company expects to meet with regulators to iron out a plan for larger trials involving thousands of individuals.Initially, the vaccine would be aimed at preventing infections in millions of people globally who need elective procedures such as a hip replacement. Ultimately, it could be used to protect people at risk in the broader community. RIVAL VACCINESPfizer is furthest along, but the large, untapped market, estimated to be worth $3 billion to $4 billion a year, has drawn interest from several companies.GlaxoSmithKline has been quiet about its approach. The drugmaker had been partnering with Nabi's failed StaphVax candidate, and in 2009 bought another Nabi candidate called PentaStaph for $46 million.Company researchers declined to discuss their program, but Glaxo spokeswoman Melinda Stubbee confirmed the company has a four-component vaccine in Phase 1 development. ""We are still evaluating the data and haven't yet announced plans to present the data or to pursue further development,"" she said.NovaDigm Therapeutics, a private company based in Grand Forks, North Dakota, is developing a single-antigen vaccine that targets both staph and yeast infections caused by the fungus Candida.Other rivals with early-stage programs include Novartis, which has a vaccine in Phase 1 trials, and Sanofi, which is partnering with privately held biotech Syntiron.Although academic researchers applaud these efforts, they say companies may be rushing into trials too soon, especially when so much is unknown about how staph interacts with people.""Our development of Staphylococcal vaccines has predated an adequate understanding of the human response to infection,"" Creech said.For instance, it is still not clear whether a Staph aureus vaccine that protects against skin infections will also protect individuals from bloodstream infections. It may be that instead of preventing infection, some vaccines will merely blunt infection.Dr. Robert Daum, who leads the MRSA Research Center at the University of Chicago Medical Center, doubts any of the current candidates will make it into widespread use. ""I am convinced we need a vaccine. I'm just not sure anyone knows how to make one yet.""Jansen, who knows Daum, said she understands his skepticism. ""I'm a microbiologist. I know bacteria pretty well. They are very potent adversaries.""She says there's a reason the company was not the first out of the gate. ""We wanted to make sure that we looked under all the rocks and found what we needed to find.""Tests in animals and people suggest the vaccine induces production of antibodies that defeat staph's defenses and kill the bacteria. ""To our knowledge, we are the only ones who have demonstrated very, very robust killing responses.""That was enough for Jansen. ""We essentially said, 'That's it. We put it together as best as we know how. Now is the time to test it.'"""
