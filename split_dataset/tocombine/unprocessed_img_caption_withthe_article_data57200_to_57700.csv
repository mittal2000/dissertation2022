But milkweed, on which butterfly larvae feed, can cause stomach problems for cattle that eat it, so ranchers and farmers destroy the plant, researchers say.The butterflies spend the winter in Mexico and then go through several generations as they fly north, through Oklahoma, on their long migration to Canada.While an estimated 1 billion monarchs migrated in 1996, only about 35 million made the trip in 2013, according to Marcus Kronforst, a professor of ecology and evolution at the University of Chicago who has studied monarchs.Their numbers have rebounded in recent years but are still well below what they were two decades ago.""The tribes are natural leaders on this issue,"" said Jane Breckinridge, project co-director and owner of the Euchee Butterfly Farm, which breeds butterflies."

The federal indictment, first reported by The Post and Courier, serves as an alternative route to convict Slager in Scott's death, and marks one of the few times an officer who shot and killed someone while on duty has been indicted on federal charges.The federal grand jury charged that Slager shot Scott ""without legal justification, willfully depriving him of the right, secured and protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States, to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a law enforcement officer.""Slager also faces charges for using a weapon during a crime of violence as well as an obstruction of justice charge. Slager allegedly ""intentionally [misled] South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) investigators in statements he provided in connection with SLED's investigation"" of the shooting. Slager allegedly ""knowingly misled"" investigators when he ""falsely stated that he (SLAGER) fired his weapon at Scott while Scott was coming forward at him with a Taser.""A video filmed by a witness showed that Scott was running away from Slager when the former North Charleston officer shot and killed him.

6,POLITICS,Employers Will Have To Publicly Disclose Their Workers' Injuries Now.

David Michaels, the head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, compared it to a public-health grade for a restaurant, saying it could ""nudge"" companies in the right direction.""Employers want to be seen as the top employers in their industry,"" Michaels said on a call with reporters Wednesday. ""No employer wants to be seen publicly as offering a dangerous workplace."" Michaels said the idea was to apply behavioral economics to workplace safety.Many employers are already required to collect information on injuries, but the data rarely sees the light of day under the current system. With the new rule, OSHA will be posting the information right on its website, enabling workers, safety advocates, researchers and others to assess the safety records of particular worksites.OSHA says the new rule will create ""the largest publicly available data set on work injuries and illnesses"" to date. It will only cover worksites in particular industries, and smaller worksites will have fewer reporting requirements than larger ones. Michaels said the new rule will not add any new costs to businesses, since the employers that fall under the rule should already be collecting the data.The rule is part of a raft of new labor regulations that the White House wants to wrap up in the last months of President Barack Obama's tenure. Other reforms will expand the availability of overtime pay, limit workers' exposure to the carcinogen known as silica, and bar low-road employers from securing federal contracts. The Labor Department is finalizing the rules now before Republicans can bottle them up through the Congressional Review Act.Trade groups representing employers are not happy with the injury reporting rule. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called it a ""misguided"" regulation that will ""lead to sensitive employer data being published without context or explanation."" The National Association of Manufacturers said it would lead to the ""unnecessary public shaming"" of companies. The Retail Industry Leaders Association said the data would be ""vulnerable to misinterpretation.""But worker advocates say companies with good safety records shouldn't fear the data being made public -- only those with poor track records should. Christine Owens, the director of the National Employment Law Project, said it would help OSHA target its limited resources toward worksites that need the scrutiny. And the Teamsters union said the rule would address a ""widespread problem"" in which employers withhold injury data from their own employees.This isn't the first time OSHA has ramped up reporting guidelines on employers during the Obama years. Last year, employers were required for the first time to promptly report all worker hospitalizations and amputations to the agency. "
7,GREEN,Why Activists Are Waging War Against This Walmart Product,Casey Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greenpeace-walmart-canned-tuna_us_5730d52ee4b096e9f092293c,So many problems in such a little can.,2016-05-11,"In addition to campaigning against Walmart, Greenpeace has deployed a ship to recover FADs in the Indian Ocean.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57333d451300001a013814a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Walmart has a tuna problem. Thanks to unscrupulous tuna suppliers and a retail system that does little to hold them to account, getting the popular fish from the sea to Walmart’s shelves can damage marine ecosystems and violate workers’ rights, according to Greenpeace USA, an environmental activist group. In April, Greenpeace launched a campaign to pressure Walmart, the country’s largest retailer, to purge its supply chain of tuna caught using destructive fishing techniques and forced labor. The campaign is one front in a larger effort to urge retailers in the United States and United Kingdom to clean up their tuna supply chains. For now, the campaign is only targeting a major supplier of the abundant Skipjack tuna, which accounts for most of the tuna found in cans, not the endangered Bluefin tuna, often found in expensive sushi.The Greenpeace has already pushed one company to change the way it sources tuna. Under pressure from environmental group, British grocery chain Waitrose announced this week that it would seek to remove unsustainably caught tuna from its shelves by the end of 2017. Like Waitrose, Walmart sources much of its tuna from Thai Union, the world’s largest canned tuna supplier. Thai Union owns the packaged seafood brand Chicken of the Sea and supplies to Walmart’s Great Value brand, both of which are sold in Walmart stores. Despite its popularity among retailers, Thai Union is notorious for using fish aggregating devices (FADs), which draw lots of fish to a small area, making them easy to scoop up. The company also relies on so-called “long lines,” which can stretch up to 80 miles and bear thousands of hooks.Though FADs and long lines can be effective fishing tools, they often snag sharks, turtles and juvenile fish as bycatch. Every year, bycatch from industrial fishing contributes to the death of 100 million sharks, including endangered white and blue sharks, as well as over 250,000 endangered loggerhead and leatherback turtles, according to the World Wildlife Fund.In a video (below), Greenpeace explains how FADs work and why they’re bad for marine animals: Thai Union has also been linked to labor abuses. Most recently, in 2015, one of Thai Union's suppliers was found to have forced Burmese migrants, some of them children, to work without pay in inhumane conditions, according to an Associated Press investigation. Greenpeace hopes that by urging Walmart to stock more sustainably and ethically sourced tuna, the group can pressure Thai Union to clean up its act. While Wal-Mart isn’t the worst offender when it comes to destructive fishing, the company has enough suction in the industry to demand that Thai Union improve its practices, according to Greenpeace. ""[Walmart] really has the buying power to call on Thai Union to demand better products and ensure its consumers and the public it’s not connected to destroying the ocean,"" David Pinsky, senior oceans campaigner for Greenpeace, told The Huffington Post.Environmentalists have pilloried the tuna industry for decades. But the time is right to once again ramp up pressure on tuna suppliers and retailers, Pinsky said in an email. ""We’re starting to see [a] shift in public awareness as more and more scandals have emerged,"" he added. Walmart says the controversy over its canned tuna is overblown. In 2015, the company adopted new sustainability guidelines for the product with input from Greenpeace. While the guidelines aren’t overflowing with specifics, they require all Walmart and Sam's Club stores, which are also owned by Walmart, to buy tuna from suppliers that comply with the International Sustainable Seafood Foundation’s sustainability rules or whose methods have been certified as sustainable by a third-party organization, like the Marine Stewardship Council.The company expects that all of its seafood will meet these new standards by the end of the fiscal year. “We are committed to finding safe, affordable and sustainable seafood for our customers that does not negatively affect global communities or the environment,” Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis told HuffPost. “Our goal is to build transparency and continuous improvement with the seafood supply chain.”But the company's commitment to buying sustainable seafood hasn't translated into action on the part of its suppliers. That's because third-party certifications aren't perfect, and the company has neglected to do more to ensure that its tuna is sustainably sourced, according to Pinsky.""Walmart's canned tuna policy is weak, riddled with loopholes, and will not significantly help our oceans or protect seafood workers,"" Pinsky said. The policy amounts to little more than “greenwashing,” he added. Pinsky said that Walmart’s efforts to crack down on forced labor, which include its support for the anti-slavery group “Project Issara,” don’t necessarily translate into a slavery-free supply chain.“Walmart has made no indication that it's demanding suppliers like Thai Union offer more sustainable and ethical products,” Pinsky said. “If Walmart were serious about the sustainability and social responsibility of its seafood, it would have no problem sharing with its customers its timeline and goals for eliminating any destructive and potentially unethical seafood from its supply chain.”While Walmart has not denied that parts of its supply chain rely on forced labor, McInnis told HuffPost that it's working with other retailers to address the issue. ""Some time ago, Walmart recognized forced labor as issues that needed to be addressed through combined, concerted action,"" she said via email. ""Both the company and the Walmart Foundation have engaged non-profits and other companies to find solutions.""Despite Walmart's efforts, Greenpeace means to press on with its campaign until the retailer ensures that its suppliers aren't abusing their workers or killing endangered animals. Rooting out unsustainable and unethical tuna ranks among the organization’s top priorities.""Here in the U.S. we’re going to continue in very public way to focus on some of the biggest buyers,"" Pinsky said. “We’re trying to really ensure we’re maintaining the health of our oceans.""CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Thai Union owns Walmart's Great Value brand. In fact, Thai Union is merely a supplier for this brand."
8,POLITICS,There's Almost No Evidence That Merrick Garland Will Take Away Your Guns,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/merrick-garland-gun-rights_us_57335475e4b016f37897c2db,A congressional report on the Supreme Court nominee should relieve fears that he's a nemesis of the Second Amendment.,2016-05-11,Rumors that Merrick Garland will strip you of your gun rights are vastly exaggerated.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A myth that has taken hold in conservatives circles since President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court is that his choice is an abomination to the legacy of Justice Antonin Scalia on gun rights.It's a widely dishonest yet potent meme, premised in part in the late justice's landmark 2008 decision that found a constitutional right to bear arms for personal use within the home.""I can't imagine that a Republican majority in the Senate would want to confirm ... a nominee that is opposed by the National Rifle Association,"" declared Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) mere days after Garland's name was revealed -- as if somehow the decision to move forward with a confirmation belonged chiefly to the gun advocacy group.The rumor casting Garland as the Second Amendment's biggest foe has taken conservative media and politicians by storm, thanks in no small part to an aggressive campaign by the Judicial Crisis Network, an organization committed to doing everything within its power to paint the otherwise centrist judge as a liberal threat to the Supreme Court.The group's ads are as scary as they come:The network is going for broke with its anti-Garland crusade, pouring upwards of $4 million into a ""let the people decide"" campaign in markets where multiple vulnerable Republican senators face tough re-election prospects. But looking at Garland's record on the Second Amendment, it turns out that there is barely any evidence there to suggest that he'll join a liberal Supreme Court majority to strip away Americans' gun rights as soon as he gets the chance. In fact, he's never written a single word on the issue.The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which advises members of Congress on legal and policy issues, took a deep dive on Garland's paper trail as an appellate judge. The ""right to bear arms"" section was barely a page long.The reason for that was simple: only one of the cases Garland considered in his nearly 20 years on the bench dealt squarely with the constitutionality of gun ownership. Garland's involvement in that case was merely procedural: a three-judge panel he wasn't part of had ruled, on a 2-to-1 vote, that a D.C. handgun ban violated the Constitution.After that ruling, the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit declined, on a 6-to-4 vote, to reconsider it. Garland was one of those four dissenting votes, which means he would have preferred for all 10 judges to give the case a second look.The reason this case may stick out in the minds of Garland's critics is what happened after: the Supreme Court agreed to hear it a year later, setting the stage for what would become District of Columbia v. Heller, the Scalia watermark that would forever reshape the Second Amendment.But the Congressional Research Service remained unimpressed as to what this meant for Garland. This and other scant evidence, its report concluded, ""would seem a tenuous basis for any firm conclusions as to Judge Garland’s approach to the Second Amendment and firearms restrictions if he were to be confirmed to the Supreme Court.""In a separate legal brief, this time two pages long, zeroing in on the Second Amendment, the service reached the same conclusion: that the nominee's paltry record on gun rights renders it ""difficult to pinpoint with certainty what views Judge Garland may have towards the Second Amendment and the regulation of firearms.""Which is to say, conservative naysayers are wrong to jump to sweeping, fearsome generalizations from Garland's record that he is somehow determined to roll back Scalia's single greatest opinion while on the bench. The evidence just isn't there.In effect, since that ruling was handed down nearly eight years ago, the Supreme Court has turned away dozens of Second Amendment cases seeking to clarify the scope of the right to bear arms -- most recently in December, when Scalia was still alive.That's good news for the otherwise centrist Garland. It's a sign that he might fit right in with the current trend among the justices: a hands-off approach that allows Scalia and Scalia alone to have -- for better or for worse -- the final word on the right that the Supreme Court has been unwilling to expand."

The proposal is creating anxiety on the Eugene campus, as similar policies have elsewhere. On the table is a plan to make every school employee a ""mandatory reporter,"" or a ""responsible employee,"" meaning that if a student tells the employee that he or she was sexually assaulted, the employee must report that to the University of Oregon's Title IX coordinator.The general counsel's office says that the school needs this policy to comply with federal guidance under the gender equity law. It also argues that such a policy will help ensure that sexual assault survivors get access to the resources they need.But some faculty disagree. They think widespread required reporting policies will take away decision-making power from rape victims, betray the trust students have in professors and potentially threaten academic freedom.""I think people get confused between stopping a cover-up and, on the other hand, requiring victims to give up their options,"" Jennifer Freyd, an Oregon professor who studies sexual violence trauma, told The Huffington Post.One study Freyd pointed to found that attempts to control the decisions of rape victims after they revealed an assault were associated with increased symptoms of post-traumatic stress.""I don't know of any research in the other direction,"" Freyd said. ""We know there's a bad side effect; the question is does the drug work at all? And I don't think we have any evidence of that at all.""Still, the University of Oregon is not alone. Nationally, schools are essentially taking one of two tracks: either declaring that all but a small handful of employees are mandatory sexual assault reporters or listing the categories of employees who must report.A University of Oregon spokesman said the school's goal to make sure survivors can still ""choose what happens after experiencing an incident of sexual violence, while also ensuring they are quickly connected with vital support resources.""Sexual assault is a vastly underreported crime, much research has shown. Proponents say these required reporting policies could improve how colleges respond to sexual violence on campus, helping them catch repeat offenders or spot survivors who are struggling but haven't yet made an official report to the Title IX office. In lawsuits and other complaints, students have faulted schools for not acting when an employee received a previous report of a particular person committing an assault.But others fear that blanket required reporting policies could drive survivors not to speak to anyone because they aren't sure what might happen next.""Title IX does not require such a broad sweep,"" the American Association of University Professors wrote in a recent white paper. The group blamed the U.S. Department of Education's 2013 agreement with the University of Montana, which imposed wide-ranging required reporting, for prompting other schools to take this route. That's not far off the truth, according to Julian R. Williams, vice president for compliance at George Mason University.The Education Department hasn't required it, ""but they've really encouraged institutions to make all of their employees -- with some exceptions -- mandated reporters,"" Williams said.These policies can also help protect schools against accusations of deliberate indifference, said former federal prosecutor Shanlon Wu. The school could point to its policy if no action were taken because a required reporter had failed to inform the designated office about an allegation of sexual assault.""I think faculty really just have to step up to the plate and accept their responsibility in these situations,"" said Wu, who is currently teaching at George Washington University. ""You certainly can't leave it up to individual faculty members about when to report, even though they might have the best intentions.""Moreover, Williams said, the reporting ""doesn't have to be as onerous as it sounds.""""What you want to do is be supportive, ask if they're OK, if they're safe -- there's no runaway train that starts,"" Williams explained. ""A good Title IX coordinator will reach out to the student and let them know their options, both internal and external resources. The ball is still very much in the student's court.""There are some concerns about who exactly must be mandatory reporters. The University of Michigan's policy, for example, generally considers people in positions of authority or a supervisory capacity as ""responsible employees"" -- which excludes most graduate students, something favored by Michigan Ph.D. candidate Kathryn Holland.""Graduate students are in a weird place,"" Holland said. ""Most of us are considered employees at the university, but we're also considered students.""The American Association of University Professors said it was especially concerned about whether these policies would chill speech in the classroom.""A while ago, I started getting emails from faculty in the composition program telling me they didn't know what to do because they teach writing, but are they supposed to turn over the essays students have written,"" said Freyd, the Oregon professor.The solution to that problem, according to Wu, is to tell students that they should omit identifying details if they want to talk about a personal experience without sparking a Title IX report. ""I don't want to hear names and dates,"" Wu suggested saying. ""This is a classroom discussion -- don't make it like a police report.""This article has been updated to more accurately reflect the higher-education terminology surrounding this policy.______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter who covers higher education and sexual violence and is based in New York.

10,QUEER VOICES,NC Official Changes Stance On Pepper Spray In Trans-Friendly School Bathrooms (UPDATE),Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nc-school-official-wants-kids-to-carry-pepper-spray-in-trans-friendly-bathrooms_us_573259a1e4b016f378977bc0,"""Perverts and pedophiles taking advantage of this law in bathrooms was my major concern,"" Chuck Hughes said.",2016-05-11,A gender-neutral bathroom is seen at the University of California in Irvine in 2014. The Obama administration is suing North Carolina over its ban of transgender-friendly restrooms.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573344f013000029003814b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: 3:35 p.m. -- Chuck Hughes, a board member who voted for students to be allowed to carry defensive sprays, told BuzzFeed Wednesday that he will change his vote. Hughes said he believes that his previous comments were ""inappropriate"" and that he didn’t mean for them to be related to the LGBT community.""Perverts and pedophiles taking advantage of this law in bathrooms was my major concern,"" he told BuzzFeed.PREVIOUSLY:High school students in North Carolina may soon be allowed to carry defensive sprays to protect themselves, with one school board member citing transgender bathroom use as a reason to be armed.The Rowan-Salisbury Board of Education ruled Monday in favor of allowing the defensive sprays, like mace or pepper spray, on its school campuses beginning this fall, the Salisbury Post reported. The board later said it will review the decision at a meeting later in the month of May.Board member Chuck Hughes voiced support of students carrying sprays, saying it could be a useful weapon should transgender students be allowed to use the restroom that matches their gender identity.""Depending on how the courts rule on the bathroom issues, it may be a pretty valuable tool to have on the female students if they go to the bathroom, not knowing who may come in,"" Hughes said, according to the Salisbury Post.Board Chairman Josh Wagner has since spoken out against that train of thought, however, telling the Huffington Post: ""This discussion in no way addressed the issue that Mr. Hughes brought up.""""He is certainly entitled to his opinion and comments. However, that idea had no bearing on the situation or discussion,"" Wagner wrote via email Wednesday to HuffPost. ""I assure you that the board did not see this as an opportunity to endorse the use of sprays in school for any reason.""Wagner went on to say that the discussion was solely based on general student safety, particularly young women when traveling to and from school, especially in the evening hours.Hughes' concern alludes to a lawsuit filed by the federal government on Monday against the state's signing of HB2, or the so-called ""bathroom bill."" It would prevent individuals, specifically transgendered individuals, from using a public restroom that doesn't match their birth gender, and the bill has been called by the Obama administration a violation of civil rights.Wagner, speaking to WBTV Tuesday, said ""concerns"" brought up after the meeting have led to the planning of a second review of whether or not defensive sprays will be allowed on school campuses. He went on to say that they've since learned that defensive sprays are not considered a prohibited item from schools by the state statute. The size and quantity of the spray can be regulated by the state, Wagner said."
11,WOMEN,Sanders Told A Female Reporter Not To 'Moan' About Hillary Clinton,Jenavieve Hatch,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sanders-told-a-female-reporter-not-to-moan-about-hillary-clinton_us_5733755ae4b0365741116fd2,Here's why that's not OK.,2016-05-11,"Bernie Sanders told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell not to ""moan... about Hillary Clinton's problems.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57339e17130000010538157c.png?cache=sPm1vojjzx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Tuesday, MSNBC anchor and news correspondent Andrea Mitchell interviewed presidential candidate and proud progressive Bernie Sanders. As Mitchell tried to discuss the challenges that fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has come up against -- especially where misogynist rhetoric from Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is concerned -- Sanders responded with a phrase that could have come from Trump himself: ""Do not moan to me about Hillary Clinton's problems.""MSNBC reporter Alex Seitz-Wald tweeted the transcript of the full exchange between Mitchell and Sanders for context: Sanders is not the first (and won't be the last) person to reduce a woman's experience to the act of ""moaning."" And regardless of shared political affiliations and goals, when a man tells a woman that she is ""moaning,"" like Sanders did to Mitchell, he is discrediting her opinion and shutting her down -- and, in this case, also invalidating Clinton's particular experiences as a woman running for public office. Sanders may not fully understand Clinton's roadblocks in this election. After all, Sanders seems to be able to show up just about anywhere, disheveled and shouting -- only to be the more charming for it. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton can't so much as get a haircut without attracting swarms of criticism. People (mostly men, but also some women) are especially keen on telling women to stop ""moaning"" or ""nagging"" when women speak up about instances of inequality and injustice. A quick browse through ""moan""-worthy headlines in the past two years shows that demanding equal pay, for example, makes men particularly defensive. What makes Sanders' statement so disappointing is that throughout his campaign, he has cemented himself as the prophet of progressives. And yet not even he -- Civil Rights protestor, socialist, feminist -- is immune to nullifying a woman's opinion with coded language. Whatever his disagreements with Clinton's policies -- or Mitchell's interpretation of the presidential race -- may be, shrugging off a woman's opinion as a mere ""moan"" is never OK. As long as men hold on to positions of power while women are simultaneously held to higher standards, there will be plenty of ""moaning."" And only when a woman can run for president without being told to ""smile"" will the days of ""moaning"" be over. Until then, men, get used to it. "

He made it even tougher on himself.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5732975c160000e60431e5ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an interview a few months back, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) explained exactly what was going through his head as his career hit a new nadir. The setting was a press conference in the midst of his 2013 mayoral campaign, and the news had broken that Weiner was sexting with Internet liaisons after he had already been forced to resign from Congress due to a similar scandal. Now in the bright spotlight of the New York media universe, he hastily arranged a press conference to address the new revelations. His wife Huma Abedin stood awkwardly by his side. ""I had had this ethos about this, that one thing I could not do anymore is be dishonest about this stuff,"" Weiner told the Huffington Post's Candidate Confessional podcast. ""What I did not realize fully at that moment was that the way I had spoken about this up till then, that most stuff was going to come out, was not satisfactory to the people I had spoken to.""Talking about that press conference in the interview, Weiner seemed sullen but not overly pained. He was, by then, far removed from the anguish.But in “Weiner,” a new documentary chronicling his failed 2013 New York City mayoral bid, viewers get a sense of how raw and panicked that moment, and those leading up to it, actually were. In the clip below, provided exclusively to The Huffington Post, Weiner sits in the back of a car with a campaign aide going over potential questions that he's bound to face after the latest scandal has emerged. The wheels turning inside Weiner's head are obvious as he tries to remember the past (unsatisfactory) answers he's given to these questions. Watching it, you get a sense of how incredibly tempting it is for politicians to try to dodge, to find a cleverly worded way out that keeps their political hopes intact. But Weiner ultimately settles on telling the truth. In turn, he begins to realize that his campaign is about to morph into a discomforting carnival, and that instead of ending up the Democratic nominee for mayor, he'll now be running for some form of political and/or moral redemption.

McSpadden has openly mourned the tragic loss of her son since he was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014. His untimely death -- and the controversial circumstances that led to it -- are topics she has openly discussed on national television, at various conferences and now in a new memoir titled, Tell the Truth & Shame the Devil: The Life, Legacy, and Love of My Son Michael Brown, which released Tuesday.She recently also shared her grievances during a special moment in the music video for Beyoncé's song ""Freedom,"" which marked perhaps one of the most powerful scenes from the singer's critically-acclaimed visual album, ""Lemonade."" McSpadden's touching tribute to her late son in the scene from the video shows her with tears in her eyes as she held a framed picture of her son. According to McSpadden, being featured in ""Freedom"" was a moment she'll never forget. ""I felt special,"" McSpadden told SiriusXM on Tuesday during an emotional interview. She also talked about how Beyoncé left a lasting impression on her. ""She had done some nice things for my son's foundation so, at that point whatever you want me to do, I'll do it... She's a sweet person... really down to earth,"" she added. ""She treated us well, made sure we were comfortable. I tried to hold it together but, any time I'm talking about my son or looking at a picture I just think that he's gone. I appreciate her for being bold enough to confront things and be sensitive at the same time."" McSpadden has worked hard to advocate for a better relationship between black communities and law enforcement. She founded an organization called The Michael O.D. Brown We Love Our Sons And Daughters Foundation, which aims to bring about systemic change to justice, health, the environment and family. She also developed the organization's first signature program ""Rainbow of Mothers,"" which was an idea sparked after she met Beyoncé's mother at the ""Rally 4 Peace"" concert Prince held last year. She recalled the defining moment in her book: I felt a light tap and turned to see Beyoncé's mama, Tina Knowles, standing there. She immediately wrapped her arms around me… For the next few minutes she shared something very special with me.McSpadden wrote in her book that she created ""Rainbow For Mothers"" because she wanted to use her voice and her platform to ""bring together a rainbow of mothers from all races and backgrounds who had either lost a child to street violence, gun violence, excessive police force, or just untimely death due to illness.""She has also teamed up with countless moms through her organization to help raise awareness around the issues that led to their children's deaths. She went on to share some very potent advice to all parents and children, too, who may potentially face circumstances similar to her own: ""I don't want them to be scared,"" she told SiriusXM. ""I want them to be aware."" "

Lew visited the island for the day to draw attention to its crumbling education, health care system and economy. Puerto Rico is facing $70 billion in debt that it cannot pay.As the House returns from a brief recess this week, Republicans are poised to unveil a third draft of legislation that would establish an oversight board to help the Puerto Rican government restructure its debt and craft a broader economic recovery plan. Previous drafts failed because they didn't get enough votes to be carried out of committee. Partisan divisions also haven't helped: Conservatives haven't supported any of the drafts because they say the legislation leans too heavily toward a bailout, and Democrats are wary of giving the oversight board too much authority. Lew’s visit lent a sense of urgency to that legislation, and put pressure on lawmakers. But it remains to be seen if they will act expeditiously.Locks bolted every door on the Paseo de Diego Pedestrian Corridor, a once-thriving strip where vendors fought for space, as Lew and his staff walked to a meeting with local business leaders. José Vazquez Barquet, president of Puerto Rico’s Chamber of Commerce, explained that nearly 80 percent of the businesses in the shopping mall are now shuttered -- an impact of the debt crisis, which has forced islanders to leave in numbers not seen in 50 years. Much of the debate in Washington has taken a financial focus, as those opposing any kind of restructuring legislation argue it would be “unfair to Puerto Rico’s creditors.” Last year, Lew explained, lawmakers were able to shrug off Puerto Rico’s dire state of affairs because the commonwealth avoided crises -- even if just barely -- until November. It used such tactics as diverting money from pensions to pay near-term bills, but that’s not possible anymore. “I don’t think it’s helpful to anyone to pretend that there’s not a crisis,” Lew told reporters after touring San Juan. “It’s important to know when you’re no longer at the beginning, but well in the middle of a crisis.”Throughout the day Lew met privately with local business leaders, members of Puerto Rico’s legislature and Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee.With a 45 percent poverty rate -- plus a 56 percent poverty rate for children -- and dwindling public services, many residents can’t afford to stay and are migrating to the mainland (84,000 people moved in 2014 alone). This has also only further hurt the economy. Antonio Weiss, counselor to Lew, told the House Natural Resources Committee earlier this year that Puerto Rico’s situation was not only a fiscal and liquidity crisis, but would turn into an “humanitarian one as well.” While visiting the Eleanor Roosevelt Elementary School, Lew saw the crumbling and unsanitary conditions that children must deal with every day. The restrooms didn’t have toilet paper or soap. Fans and open windows provided the only respite from the 80-degree weather outside. Termites infected classroom walls. Lew asked a kindergarten teacher if conditions had always been this poor, or if the deterioration was recent. She told him the problems had increased in the past year. “Here in Puerto Rico, due to the crisis that we inherited, this is an everyday job of borrowing [from] Peter to pay Paul,” Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla told reporters when he joined Lew at the school.The secretary visited three more classrooms, including one filled with fourth-graders, according to a pool report. Teacher Elizabeth Claudio pointed to the room's one electrical outlet and said it isn't possible to run laptops, TVs and fans simultaneously. And if multiple classrooms try to run several appliances at once, the electricity will go out. ""You all keep doing your work, and we'll keep doing our work to help you,” Lew told the kids on his way out. Lew’s trip to the island, which is home to 3.5 million Americans, was meant to shift the focus from more technical details of the debt crisis to the personal. But the government, creditors and retirees are still facing a struggle. Retirees in the commonwealth who invested their pensions in Puerto Rico bonds have argued that previous drafts of the House bill would allow stateside bondholders to be paid back first.“There’s going to have to a be a balance of the interest of creditors and those who get the retirement benefits,” Lew said. ""There's not going to be a Puerto Rico"" if conservatives on the fence about the bill insist creditors must be paid before anyone else, he added. That’s why Lew has argued for an oversight board that would have the discretion when working with the local government to make tradeoff decisions. “If the economy of Puerto Rico collapses even more, if the retiree income isn’t in the economy, if people leave the island because they are not willing to work for a system that doesn’t pay any benefits, how is that going to help all the bondholders?” Lew said. The Treasury has worked closely with Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee, but Lew said he hasn't seen the version that is set to be released Wednesday. Congress has dragged its feet for some time on debt relief legislation, and has gone back to the drawing board after coming close to agreements. Lew said he hopes things will be different this time, even if it's only because time is running out. ""I hope Congress does not, as it sometimes does, try to find that last possible moment and miss it,"" Lew said.July 1 is one of the largest debt payment deadlines Puerto Rico has faced so far -- $2 billion. And that’s on the heels of defaulting on a nearly $400 million payment on May 1.  “What happened on May 1 was just bigger than anything that could be ignored, and what’s coming in July is five times as large,” Lew said. “It’s ratcheting up, and what we saw today is that the crisis is immediate in terms of real life.”"

22,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Inspired This Progressive To Challenge A Democratic Incumbent,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-oregon_us_57323332e4b096e9f092f077,The Working Families Party is hoping the connection will help a House candidate defy the odds next Tuesday.,2016-05-10,A section of one of the mailers the Working Families Party is sending to voters in Oregon's 5th District on McTeague's behalf.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573237192200008f032562ed.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A progressive House candidate is tying himself as closely to Bernie Sanders as possible in the hopes that it will help him pull off a major upset against a relatively conservative Democratic incumbent in Oregon next Tuesday, foreshadowing a way in which the independent Vermont senator's political revolution may continue after the presidential primary has concluded. Dave McTeague served as a state representative in Oregon’s legislature before working as the executive director of the state’s chiropractic examiners board. He’s challenging Rep. Kurt Schrader, who is serving his fourth term as the representative for Oregon’s 5th district. Schrader is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition for conservative Democrats and has one of the most conservative voting records for a Democrat in the House. As a superdelegate, Schrader is backing Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at the party’s convention this summer.McTeague has said he entered the race for Schrader’s seat because he was inspired by Sanders, who has engaged millions of supporters across the country. Schrader voted last summer to give President Barack Obama Trade Promotion Authority, otherwise known as fast-track approval, to negotiate international trade deals, and it's one the main issues McTeague is now running on. Schrader called AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka a “bully” because of the labor organization’s threat that it would withhold campaign donations to Democrats over the fast-track legislation.“These days a lot of voters, Democratic voters too, don’t feel represented by the Washington Establishment and want real change,” McTeague said in a statement announcing his candidacy. “This is evident in the success of Sen. Sander’s insurgent presidential campaign, which I strongly support … I don’t have any illusions about this effort. Running against an entrenched incumbent is like taking on the Death Star in Star Wars especially one with access to a million or more dollars of PAC money.”McTeague has some well-organized help behind him. The Working Families Party (WFP), a political group that campaigns for progressive candidates and policies, has sent two different Sanders-themed mailers to roughly 20,000 households in the district in support of McTeague. (The WFP, which has chapters in a dozen states, endorsed Sanders in December, which was its first national endorsement.)""Progressive voters in Oregon are lucky to have a choice on the ballot who will bring the fight for Bernie's political revolution to Congress,” said Dan Cantor, the WFP’s national director. “It takes courage to stand up against a well-funded and powerful incumbent, and Dave McTeague is someone who has always shown that kind of courage. From his time as a state legislator standing up to insurance companies and polluters to his opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership to his bold endorsement of Bernie Sanders, McTeague has distinguished himself as a true champion for our values.” The WFP has also put up digital advertisements aimed at Sanders supporters and is hosting phone banks for the candidate. While McTeague may have only the slightest chance of defeating Schrader -- he got into the race only a week before the filing deadline and has raised only a fraction of what Schrader has raised -- the contest between the two Democrats is an illustration of the sorts of races that may happen more frequently. Law professor Tim Canova’s race is another example; he has has garnered media attention in his bid to unseat Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida. The Florida race has drawn attention in part because Wasserman Schultz is of the country's highest-profile Democrats. But Sanders’ record-breaking fundraising and strong challenge to Clinton may embolden more progressives to run against incumbents in future election cycles, with the recognition that progressive Democrats need to focus more on down-ballot races. Unlike Republicans, Democrats rarely challenge sitting Democrats. A congressional primary candidate hasn’t defeated an incumbent in Oregon in 36 years. The WFP hopes that Sanders’ likely primary win in Oregon against Clinton on May 17 will boost McTeague. But even if he loses, the group wants Democratic incumbents like Schrader to think twice about voting for bills like fast-track, which progressive groups and labor unions abhor."
23,SPORTS,There Are No Internet Headlines To Describe What Stephen Curry Just Did,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-curry-overtime-portland-trail-blazers_us_5731e4dbe4b096e9f0928c30,"Even in the age of Internet hyperbole, Wardell leaves us speechless.",2016-05-10,"Stephen Curry drives to the rim against the Portland Trail Blazers in Game Four of the Western Conference Semifinals on May 9, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5731e62822000036002561fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The ever-intensifying competition for eyeballs in an online media landscape with a seemingly endless number of publications, posts, tweets, videos and statuses has led to an economy dependent upon hyperbole.With so many publications vying every minute to convince a finite number of humans to stop mid-News Feed and realize their story is the one that matters, media outlets have taken to creative (and often deceptive) eye-catching tricks to heighten their chances. This is the reason for the rise of ""clickbait,"" headlines that scream ""LOOK AT ME"" in the hope of cutting through the noise and winning your attention, even for a few mere seconds. It is the reason you can't believe what happens next, and that you need to see this hot new thing. It is the reason behind ""WHOA"" and ""LOOK"" and ""WATCH"" and ""GASP,"" that the best thing ever happens every night, and that the worst thing ever happens, too.By sheer force of competition, the online media has gotten great at twisting hyperbole to their advantage, much to the dismay of many of its consumers (and if you ask them privately, many members of the media, too). But at least we have Stephen Curry, the one member of the sports establishment that is beyond all that. The greatness of what Curry did on Monday night in five minutes of overtime cannot be exaggerated by the Internet. There are no tricks in the Secret Online Media Handbook to adequately describe what he did, nor any clickbait devices that would come across as deceptive, or exaggerated, or groan-worthy, or insincere. For once, someone actually did something that was amazing. For once, a human being was placed into a situation, and you truly could not believe what happened next.Curry had not played in 15 days. He had missed his last four games with an MCL sprain. He was only supposed to play 25 minutes, to shake off the rust during Game 4 of the Western Conference semi-finals against the Portland Trail Blazers so that he would be fully ready to return to his MVP form during Game 5. Instead, he entered overtime with a respectable 23 points, then spent the next five minutes disrespecting the entire Trail Blazers organization.Every shot from Stephen Curry's historic 17-point overtime.In a game that was supposed to work as something of a warm-up for an injured star hoping for the best, Curry took advantage of the Trail Blazers' defense when it faltered and overcame it when it did everything right. By the time the final buzzer sounded, Curry had scored 17 points in a single overtime -- the most by any player in NBA history, playoffs or regular season -- and 40 for the game, the most by a bench player in the history of the NBA playoffs to boot. The Warriors won the game, 132-125, putting them up 3-1 in the series. But as has been the case in so many of the Warriors' games this season, the victory felt like an afterthought. Climbing back from injury, Curry had outscored the opposing team 17-14 in overtime. ""I'm here! I'm back!"" he screamed. And he was.Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen's shocked expression, his mouth agape, would soon become the latest victim of the Internet. Head coach Steve Kerr could only bring himself to say, ""That was crazy."" Asked whether he thought the Trail Blazers were done, Draymond Green replied, ""Do I think they're done? Of course I think they're done."" Curry will be starting the next game, but there's really nothing else to say. You just have to watch the overtime yourself, your mouth agape, unable to describe quite what you're seeing, like everyone else."
