Unfortunately, colder weather takes a toll on skin. To learn how to cope we spoke with board certified dermatologists Dr. Gervaise Gerstner and Dr. Roopal Kundu. Find out what the experts recommend:1. Moisturize.  ""Some patients get very dry in the colder weather. Wind chaps the skin, and heat from radiators can really dry it out. During the winter months you can keep your skin healthy by moisturizing regularly.""- Dr. Gervaise Gerstner, Assistant Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical School 2. Update your skincare routine.  ""You can compensate for seasonal weather changes by switching up your cleansers. In the colder weather, use a more moisturizing cleanser. It tends to be more humid in the summertime and there tends to be a little more oil production, so in the summertime you can switch to a more oil-free, acne-prone product.""- Dr. Gervaise Gerstner, Assistant Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical School3. If you have sensitive skin that tends to get more dry in the winter, try different products. ""People who have sensitive skin can change up their cosmeceuticals if they want. For example, when it comes to anti-aging treatments, Vitamin C and peptides might be less irritating for sensitive skin.""- Roopal V. Kundu, MD, Associate Professor of Dermatology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine4. Do not stop wearing sunscreen.  ""You need to wear sunscreen everyday, even on snowy February days. Read the labels very carefully. You need a broad spectrum sunscreen, and you need to read the label very carefully to make sure it says UVA/UVB coverage. For day-to-day use, SPF 15 is fine. ""- Dr. Gervaise Gerstner, Assistant Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical School 5. When you go on vacation, update your skincare routine. ""If you go on holiday, remember to adjust your daily SPF accordingly, even if you're going on, say, a ski trip. Snow creates a lot of reflection, which can cause damage. Always remember to wear sunscreen.""- Roopal V. Kundu, MD, Associate Professor of Dermatology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine"

So you do your best to prevent that by avoiding the typical things: no beer before liquor, drinking a cup of coffee so you can sober up efficiently before bed, and staying away from the Red Bull and vodkas that you used to love so much. But sadly, none of these things are actually going to help you out.

While some drinks may be more alcoholic than others, it has nothing to do with their color, even though many believe darker beers are automatically higher in alcohol than their light counterparts. And as for those alcoholic energy drinks you're steering away from, that's probably a good idea, but it's not necessarily going to keep you from getting less intoxicated. People like to believe they can curb the side effects of a hangover by vomiting up the rest of the alcohol in their systems before hitting the hay or consuming lighter colored alcohol rather than dark whiskeys and cognacs, but in reality, if you overindulge at all, you're going to be hungover.

Now his words are coming back to bite him in the derri√®re, as a group called Belle, Ronde, Sexy et je M'assume has filed a legal complaint against him in France.The organization, whose name translates to ""Beautiful, Round, Sexy and OK with It,"" is accusing the Chanel designer of ""defamatory and discriminatory comments,"" reports AFP. Betty Aubriere, the group's president, told AFP, ""We're fed up. Many young girls are insecure and hearing such comments is terrible for them,"" particularly from famous people. ""Today it's him who insults us and tomorrow who will it be?"" With its move against Lagerfeld, Aubriere says it hopes to address size discrimination broadly. Most individuals aren't as outspoken as Karl, who famously called Adele ""a little too fat"" and supposedly told a reporter, ""No one wants to see curvy women."" But discrimination against curvier women as well as men seeps into society in countless inconspicuous ways, from the lack of plus-size celebs in movies to stores that strategically cater to smaller sizes and even anti-fat biases in the workplace.Targeting Karl Lagerfeld will likely focus attention specifically on the fashion industry, where unspoken (and sometimes spoken) standards for body shape have had damaging effects on both the models and the consumers who see them in ads and magazines. On a more local level, Aubriere told the AFP that they are also pushing to end bullying, advocating more awareness in schools ""so that people understand that curves are often an illness or genetic, and not due to a poor diet.""Think that this latest legal filing will make a difference in France... or force Lagerfeld to change his loose-lipped ways?On the record:Want more?

The U.N.'s health agency said Tuesday it has confirmed 10 polio cases in northeast Syria, the first confirmed outbreak of the diseases in the country in 14 years, with a risk of spreading across the region. (AP Photo/UNICEF, Omar Sanadiki)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9da0fa2000003000fe09d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Stephanie NebehayGENEVA, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Polio has broken out among young children in northeast Syria after probably originating in Pakistan and poses a threat to millions of children across the Middle East, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tuesday.The crippling disease, which is caused by a virus transmitted via contaminated food and water, could spread especially fast in Syria, where civil war has led to falling vaccination rates.Twenty-two children in Deir al-Zor province bordering Iraq became paralysed on Oct. 17 and the polio virus has been confirmed in samples taken from 10 victims. Results on the other 12 are expected within days.""This virus has come over land which means the virus is not just in that corner of Syria but in a broad area,"" Bruce Aylward, WHO assistant director-general for polio, emergencies and country collaboration, told Reuters in an interview.""We know a polio virus from Pakistan was found in the sewage of Cairo in December. The same virus was found in Israel in April, also in the West Bank and Gaza.""It... is putting the whole Middle East at risk quite frankly,"" he said by telephone from Oman.Polio, which invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours, can spread rapidly among children under five, especially in the unsanitary conditions endured by the displaced in Syria or crowded refugee camps in neighbouring countries.It is endemic in just three countries - Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan - raising the possibility that foreign fighters imported the virus into Syria, where Islamist militants are among the groups battling to oust President Bashar al-Assad.Genetic sequencing of the virus found in Syria is expected within the next days, which will identify the geographic origin of the first polio outbreak in the war-torn country since 1999.""Everything suggests this virus will be linked to the virus that originated in Pakistan,"" Aylward said.""We are looking basically at re-infection of the Middle East. Syria is the canary in the coal mine,"" he said. VACCINATIONSMost of the 22 Syrian victims are under two years old and are believed never to have been vaccinated or to have received only a single dose of the oral vaccine instead of the three which ensure protection, WHO spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer said.""Immunisations have started in that area,"" Rosenbauer said, referring to Deir al-Zor, whose main city is partly controlled by Assad forces while rebels hold the surrounding countryside.A previously planned immunisation campaign was launched in Syria on Oct. 24 to vaccinate 1.6 million children against polio, measles, mumps and rubella, in both government-controlled and contested areas, the WHO said on Tuesday.Anthony Lake, executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), said he had held ""businesslike and encouraging"" talks with Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi in Damascus.He called for the estimated half a million Syrian children who have not been vaccinated against polio and other debilitating diseases because of the war to be vaccinated.Syria has about three million under-5s in total.As well as Syria, Aylward said at least six other Middle East nations - Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinian territories - plan polio immunisation campaigns.""This will cover over 20 million children in the next months,"" he said.The campaigns are likely to begin in early November and to last at least six to eight months, the WHO said in a statement.About 4,000 refugees flee the war in Syria every day, mainly crossing into Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Turkey.Before the conflict, which began with peaceful protests in March 2011 and led to a civil war, 91 percent of Syrian children had been vaccinated against diseases including polio, but the rate has fallen to about 68 percent, Rosenbauer said.""So it makes sense that very young kids would get it.""
