As it happens, these two ingredients pair incredibly well with ripe plums!The cornmeal finds its way into the streusel that adorns the sweet-yet-tangy fruits. Along with the crystalline turbinado sugar, it gives the topping a marvelous crunch. The Bourbon ends up in the luscious crème fraîche, and ties all the elements of the dessert together in a delicious knot.The plums I always use to make this crisp are the purplish Italian prune plums (also called Empress plums). They're small and egg-shaped, with a sweet yellow flesh, but their skins are tangy and make your saliva glands tingle when you bite into one. It's that juicy acidity that makes these plums so wonderful to cook with. Because of my love affair with the petite fruit, I haven't made this crisp with other kinds of plums yet. But my guess is that it would be delicious with just about any variety.Here's wishing you a fantastic time baking this delicious crisp!Plum Crisp with Cornmeal Streusel and Bourbon Crème FraîcheServes 6 Active time: 30 minFor the crème fraîche 1/3 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons organic sugar 2 tablespoons Bourbon 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup crème fraîcheFor the fruits 2 1/2 lbs (1.1 kg) prune plums - unpeeled, pits removed and quartered 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1/2 cup turbinado sugar 1 tablespoon cornstarchFor the crisp topping 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour 1/2 cup cornmeal 1/3 cup turbinado sugar pinch sea salt 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 6 tablespoons unsalted butter - cold 6 one-cup-capacity ramequins - lightly buttered or 1 medium ceramic baking dish (12"" x 9"") - lightly butteredPreheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC).Step 1: For the crème fraîche - Place the heavy cream, sugar, Bourbon and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat at medium speed until the cream is thick. Add the crème fraîche and continue to beat for a few seconds at slow speed until just incorporated. Transfer to a container and refrigerate until ready to serve.Step 2: Place the plum slices in a large bowl. Sprinkle with the lemon juice, sugar and cornstarch and stir until well incorporated. Spoon into the prepared individual molds (or single mold) and set aside.Step 3: Place the flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Process until well blended. Add the vanilla and chunks of butter and pulse until coarse crumbs form and start to come together (do not over-process or the mixture will form a dough). Sprinkle the streusel on top of the fruits. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until the streusel is golden-brown and the fruits are bubbly. Remove from oven and let cool until warm. Serve the individual crisps in their molds with a dollop of the Bourbon crème fraîche.Cook's note: The crisps can be made up to 6 hours ahead and kept at room temperature. To serve, preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC) and bake for 6 to 8 minutes until just warmed. Leftovers can be refrigerated for up to two days, although the topping will lose its crunch."

Including you.",2013-09-20,Ever wondered would look like pointed lensbaby up into snow blizzard and fired a shot with flash.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d87f626000036007fe9b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The book, Happiness as a Second Language, opens with the description of my comically stupid attempt to end my own life. This sentence alone has already offended some people, because suicide is clearly not a laughing matter, but there is no other way to describe it for me. My one and only try was incredibly stupid, and in hindsight, pretty funny. It wasn't a cry for help, since no one ever knew about it until 15 years later when the book came out, but it was a rash act, in a moment of hopelessness, that I cannot for the life of me figure out the reason for, looking back now with perspective.Perspective is, of course, one of the great casualties of despair. Whatever we are going through, we think it's the worst thing to ever happen to anyone and it will never improve. We also think we are all alone in the universe, which is completely wrong. The human experience has some recurring and very common themes, a fact that I find extremely comforting. Two things discussed in the foreword of Happiness are a series of horrible events that all happened on the same day (which, in hindsight, were the best things that ever happened to me), and my suicide attempt -- before realizing the upside of those events. Since this book came out, I have heard from so many people who have had similar experiences.Turns out, it's fairly common for people to get a huge, unexpected jolt to the system that makes them question every choice they've ever made. It might be a death in a family, the departure of a spouse, a job loss, an illness, an act of God, or something so out of the ordinary, I can't even think of it right now, but many, many, many of us have been there.And a handful of us hit a point where we feel we can't take it anymore, so we contemplate, and possibly attempt, and sadly, sometimes succeed at, ending it all. We think we are so alone that no one could ever understand how bad things are, and also, we get a warped idea that everyone else would be better off if we were gone. Both of these things are completely untrue, and more people would realize that, if they could just find it in themselves to reach out to someone -- anyone -- and talk about what they're going through. That takes boundless courage, but it sure beats the alternative.Every single day, I hear from people who, at one time or another, got to the point of trying to end it all and now, years later, are so grateful that what they tried didn't work. Some of these emails are from total strangers, but shockingly, a lot come from friends; people I have known for years. I've gotten messages along the lines of, ""Remember that time I didn't return your call for a week? Yeah, I was in the hospital because I took all the pills in the house."" What?! I'm stunned each time, but I guess it's what I deserve. None of them knew I'd been there and done that until they read it in a book, along with thousands of other people. My parents didn't know. My sister didn't know. The friend whose phone call saved my life was never told, but when I asked her to sign the release (since her real name is in the book), she told me she knew something was going on at the time. That's why she wouldn't get off the phone until I agreed to come meet her. I'm glad her call arrived when it did, but it never occurred to me then that I could have made that call.We are all in this together. Look around -- at the other people in your office, at your school, on the bus, going to your church, working out at your gym. Someone has been where you are. And they're still here. And they would want you to know that. You are one in a million. Which means there are 7,100 of you on the planet. Instead of going to meet your maker, call a friend, walk into a clinic, go on the Internet. Find a support group. Enter a chat room or join a message board where everybody is kind and supportive. Whatever you are feeling, someone will know what to say or what to do to make it seem less overwhelming. What you're going through, another person on the planet is going through, too -- at this very moment. And someone else. And someone else. And someone else. And some of them are having an easier time than you and some are having a much tougher time than you, but the bottom line is, you are not a unique snowflake. Stick around a while longer. It's the whole blanket of snow that makes the world beautiful, and we need every flake to be part of it.

Modern couples are much more likely to cite unreasonable behavior as the cause of their splits; 47 percent of divorcés today cite unreasonable behavior, compared to 28 percent in the '70s.According to The Guardian, some examples of unreasonable behavior include ""an unsociable husband making his wife feel guilty when she wanted to go out with her friends, a cross-dressing husband who decided to have a sex change, and a spouse withdrawing all the family savings.""This isn't the first study to look at rationales for divorce. Research from August 2013 found that parents are more likely to divorce after their kids' summer vacations, and a recent study out of Kansas State University found that couples who argue about finances, particularly early in their partnerships, face a greater risk of divorce.Click through the slideshow below to see even more fascinating divorce research.Keep in touch!

My siblings and I sift through the items my mother cannot take with her to her new ""home"" at the assisted-living facility. Divorced for 27 years, she lived independently into her early 80s, but the combination of her macular degeneration (which led to legal blindness) and the early stages of Alzheimer's disease has forced our hand.Among the nostalgic items, we can't resist perusing my mother's wedding album from 1957. The final black-and-white photo strikes me silent as I gaze at the close-up of my mother and father on their wedding day. Through an open window, they look out at me from the back seat of a classic '50s car with the biggest grins I've ever seen them wear at the same time. He sports horn-rimmed glasses; she wears a stylish white hat. In every sense of the word, they seem ""home.""One would think that seeing this image makes me sad, given where that car ultimately leads my parents. And that is part of my reaction. In fact, a shaded peephole frames the photo, like an eye closing slowly. But I also can't stop admiring the photo for its simple beauty. I think all adult children have to acknowledge that no matter the course of our relationship with our parents, highlights along the way inevitably frame themselves on the walls of our minds. Such moments help explain key parts of our saga. As the youngest of my five siblings, I am the furthest from 1957 -- hence the pull of seeing my parents' original bliss. My wife, Michele, and I have been married for 18 years. As I think about our wedding photos, I suspect the one my children will cherish someday is of Michele and me about to cut into our three-tiered chocolate wedding cake. Indeed, my 13-year-old daughter recently tried on the wedding dress in the photo, which was worn by both my wife and mother-in-law. As she twirled, three generations danced.If I could choose, however, I'd prefer my children favor a goofy picture of Michele and me during our courtship. It features me with a ridiculous beard and her with a ridiculous head of big, fake-blonde hair. But our grins also feature ridiculous happiness.My parents were married for 28 years, just one shy of how long they've been divorced. I don't know what to make of that symmetry, but I do know that via a photograph, their wedding day still exists.As my mother's condition progresses, memories and verb tenses are starting to jumble through her speech. While this is often frustrating for her and heartbreaking for her children, there are also moments of timeless joy. Thanks to an image in an album, on a wall, or in a mind, you can indeed go home again -- if only for a flash."
7,WELLNESS,6 Ways To Be Happier At Work,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-be-happier-at-work_us_5b9d7f32e4b03a1dcc88c568,"3. Don't fight other people's battles. It can be tempting to get involved in other people's grievances at work, but you can",2013-09-19,Young woman holding a placard reflecting her feelings,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d7f3226000033007fe5f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Alison Green for U.S. NewsGiven how much time most of us spend at work, it's worth doing whatever you can to make sure you're as happy as possible there. The basics are probably obvious -- find work you like, with co-workers you enjoy and a manager who does her job. But here are six less-obvious ways that you might not have thought of to increase your happiness at work.More From U.S. News: The 100 Best Jobs Don't Worry, Be Happy -- at Work 6 Ways To Build a More Positive Workplace1. Don't let resentments simmer. Often people become resentful of expectations that they assume their colleagues or managers have of them, when in fact those expectations are all internal. For instance, you might be frustrated that your boss regularly emails you late in the evening, making you feel like you have to respond to work emails from home. But if you talked to her, you might learn that she doesn't expect an immediate response at all -- she just prefers to work when the office is quiet and empty.If something is bothering you, don't stew in silence -- ask about it. Whatever the issue, it's worth communicating and making sure that your assumptions are correct before letting yourself get bothered.2. Don't attribute to malice what might be a mistake. For instance, if your co-worker routinely ignores your emails, you might get angry at what seems like disregard or disrespect. But if you approach him from that stance, the conversation is likely to be adversarial. You'll generally get better results if you approach him with the assumption that there's been a mistake instead -- maybe your emails are getting caught in his spam filter or there's some other technological glitch. Even when people really are at fault, starting with the assumption that they're not to blame will make most conversations go better.3. Don't fight other people's battles. It can be tempting to get involved in other people's grievances at work, but you can end up taking on the emotional burden of battles that aren't yours. For instance, if Joe hates your manager and complains about her all the time, you might find over time that you've come to dislike her too -- even though you got along with her perfectly well before. This can lead you to make bad decisions for yourself, like becoming unhappy with a job or manager you otherwise liked, or even leaving your job over it. This isn't to say that you shouldn't be sympathetic to co-workers' troubles or that you shouldn't speak up about serious workplace problems, but for routine complaints, keep in mind that you don't know the full story and try to stay out of it.4. Use your benefits. When you think about your benefits package, you probably think about health insurance and vacation time. However, many employers offer tons of other benefits as well -- fitness memberships, employee assistance programs, credit unions and more. Lots of employees don't even realize they have these benefits, let alone use them. But these are part of your compensation, and you should take advantage of them if they might make your life better.5. Thank people. If someone made your life at work easier, connected you with a helpful contact, or simply has been a pleasant person to interact with, tell them! Openly appreciating your colleagues can strengthen your workplace relationships, improve the way people see you and make you genuinely more appreciative of where you work and the people you work with.6. Know your bottom line. Yes, your job has frustrations. But before you get too focused on them, it's helpful to get really clear in your own mind on what your bottom line is: what things matter most to you and what trade-offs you are and aren't willing to make. For instance, maybe you hate your manager but love having a short commute. You'd rather keep that commute, even if it means your manager is part of the deal. Or maybe you're willing to put up with a lower salary because you get to do work that fascinates you -- or will tolerate less interesting work because you get paid generously. Getting really clear about what matters most to you will help keep you focused on what you care most about, and prevent you from getting sidetracked on things that don't ultimately matter as much to you.Alison Green writes the popular Ask a Manager blog, where she dispenses advice on career, job search, and management issues. She's also the co-author of Managing to Change the World: The Nonprofit Manager's Guide to Getting Results, and former chief of staff of a successful nonprofit organization, where she oversaw day-to-day staff management, hiring, firing, and employee development."
