Author, ""This Made Me Think of You""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dear-bravo-the-lesbians-are-pissed_us_5bafb27ae4b0ad7692604ab5,"In the Tuesday, March 19, episode of The Millionaire Matchmaker, Patti Stanger was charged with matching her first lesbian, Khristianne Uy, aka Chef K. Bravo had the opportunity to showcase a real lesbian courtship and matchmaking and completely dropped the ball.",2013-03-23,"LOS ANGELES, CA - MAY 14: TV personality Patti Stanger arrives to Bravo Media's celebration of the book release of Andy Cohen's 'Most Talkative: Stories From The Front Lines Of Pop Culture' at SUR Lounge on May 14, 2012 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafb27a2400003100550e25.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I love Bravo. For years I have watched quality programming that has been geared toward me and the rest of the LGBT community. The Real Housewives franchise is basically Mean Girls 20 years later, and I'm obsessed. Watching Tabatha Coffey take over salons and bring unsuspecting business owners to tears makes me swoon, and pretty much anything that Rachel Zoe does basically cries, ""Gays! Come watch me! I'm pouting!"" Most of the programs are can't-miss. However, I must admit that the Tuesday, March 19, episode of The Millionaire Matchmaker left me wondering whether the folks at Bravo really know their audience as well as they claim.The episode featured Patti Stanger overly excited to match her first lesbian, Khristianne Uy, aka Chef K. This was a huge deal for the show. Over the years Ms. Stanger has had the opportunity to match not only heterosexual millionaires but, in more recent years, gay male millionaires, but this was the first time that the show had the chance to showcase women falling in love with women and what it's like for mature lesbians to find a real relationship. After watching the show, I can safely say that that wonderful opportunity was squandered; the episode was poorly representative of what a lesbian pursuant of a relationship is like.After interviewing the first three women who were hoping to be matched with one of the episode's millionaires, Patti immediately started trafficking in stereotypes, saying, ""Did you notice how I didn't ask the first three women whether they were straight or gay? I just knew they were straight."" When the second group of women entered, she asked the first woman if she is gay, and the woman responded that she is bisexual. Then Patti called out another woman as a lesbian. Granted, she was correct, but she should not have been making assumptions about any woman's sexuality based on her appearance, especially considering that she was now being commissioned to match a lesbian. While interviewing straight women who were there to be matched with a male millionaire, she asked them about their careers, what they are looking for as far as family goes, and what they aspire to be. However, when she interviewed the women who were there to be matched with Chef K, all she seemed to ask them was whether or not they would be open to dating someone who identifies as ""butch.""""Patti is extremely good at what she does,"" says Meghann Novinskie, an LGBT relationships expert and the executive director of Mixology: Matching With a Twist. ""And I am sure, as a matchmaker myself, that Patti asked the potential daters further questions about what they were looking for in a potential partner and not just whether or not they were butch of fem. It's a shame that Bravo didn't air that. In relationships, gay or straight, there is more to a love connection than outside appearances. It was a shame that because lesbians are often stereotyped as butch or fem and will only date the opposite, it seemed almost as if they were perpetuating that stereotype.""Indeed, after six seasons on the air and countless success stories, it's quite clear that Patti Stanger knows what she's doing, so there's little doubt that questions beyond the aesthetic were touched upon, so it then becomes an editing issue. Bravo is a network that has a large gay audience, so whoever was in charge of editing the program did the network and the LGBT community a huge disservice. Bravo had the unique opportunity to showcase a real lesbian courtship and matchmaking and completely dropped the ball. Just in case anyone over at the network was wondering, the ""L"" in ""LGBT"" stands for ""lesbian"" -- and every lesbian that I know who saw the episode is extremely disappointed in the stereotypical portrayal of their community.""When someone hires a matchmaker, they're looking for the whole package, not just a pretty face,"" Novinskie adds. ""You can get a pretty face on your own at a bar. It seems like Chef K was looking for the whole package. Bravo could have showcased Patti, a successful, well-respected matchmaker, screening the lesbians as well as she screened the straight women, but they didn't.""I will continue to watch Bravo, because their overall support for and representation of the LGBT community far surpasses that of many of the other networks, but the single lesbian inside me died a little bit on March 19. Here's hoping that the next time Bravo decides to feature lesbians in a program, they will do it in a much more flattering and realistic light."

How do I teach my sons to understand and respect girls when there is a larger culture and marketplace that shamelessly hyper-sexualizes very young girls?,2013-03-22,Little blond boy picking an apple from a tree branch. he laughs. Wear a shirt.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf30626000036007fadcc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My sons are the love bugs in our family. Jonah and Gabriel are six and three, and they are full of affection for their older sister, and for me. They are the ones most likely to share hugs and kisses, to remind their sister that she is adored, and to draw hearts for my husband and me. Their thoughtful, loving, and strong spirits have always made me feel confident about what kind of men they will become.But I must admit that Steubenville has shaken me. I feel challenged by what it means to raise boys against the backdrop of what is becoming our rape culture. How do I teach my sons to understand and respect girls when there is a larger culture and marketplace that shamelessly hyper-sexualizes very young girls? How do I teach my sons about respectful physical interactions when most boys learn about the female body through mainstreamed, hardcore porn? What rules of personal responsibility can be sketched out for them when there is still a narrative that ""boy will be boys"" when it comes to assault or rape, but girls are expected to be responsible for themselves and for how they are treated by others? What notions of masculinity can I share with them that have nothing to do with subjugating, objectifying or denigrating women and girls?I am grateful to have a husband who models for his sons a masculinity that is rooted in love and respect for women and girls, that is demonstrated everyday in the way that he loves our daughter and me. I am also grateful for many of the posts by other parents that have appeared on this website and other social media sites as we struggle together to do right by our children. Part of the work is having these public square conversations about our children and sexual violence. And I take comfort from Zerlina Maxwell's five points on how to teach boys and men not to rape. She writes:1. Teach young men about legal consent:  2. Teach young men to see women's humanity, instead of seeing them as sexual objects there for male pleasure:  3. Teach young men how to express healthy masculinity:  4. Teach young men to believe women who come forward and not to blame the victim. 5. Teach young men about bystander intervention.Folks like Neil Irvin and Ted Bunch of Men Can Stop Rape and A Call to Men are teaching these new lessons in manhood to other boys and men. Nevertheless, there is a very pervasive rape culture, against which it feels daunting to teach our sons healthy constructs of masculinity. But this is what we must do, as mothers and fathers. Our children deserve no less."

But it's not until you've been through divorce or a tough breakup that you begin to realize how much truth that platitude actually holds. Take it from the folks on Reddit. On Thursday night, the thread ""Divorcees of Reddit, what things did your ex do before your marriage that, in hindsight, you should have known not to marry him/her?"" blew up on the social network, with both men and women weighing in with the pre-marriage warning signs they ignored. So what were some of the most ominous red flags? For one man, it started with meeting the folks: intensenerd: When I arrived, there were two men leaving their home wearing suits and driving a rental car. When I asked who they were, her mom explained that it was 2 producers from the Jerry Springer show. They were there to interview her grandfather and her big brother.Yikes. Down-thread, one woman said a shady office relationship should have been warning enough: OfTheBegin_Ning: He had an uncomfortably close “friendship” with a girl he worked with, and it was practically a weekly thing for me to ask if he was involved with her. He always denied it up and down. Yeah, they’re married now.The last straw for this Redditor? When her husband asked for an open marriage. For another woman, the pre-marriage warning sign was her boyfriend's utter lack of compassion when her grandfather died. Valeskatriona: The day my grandfather died, I was crying on the front porch and he just stood there with his arms crossed and stared at me. I had to ask for a hug. He also did not come to the funeral and when I was with my family afterwords he sent me several text messages asking why I wasn't home already. When I got home he guilt tripped me, because I wasn't home earlier for him to comfort me. Yeah... I was an idiot. Needless the say, the marriage did not last. But perhaps the most glaringly obvious red flag mentioned on the thread? butthead_is_my_cat's partner's tendency to refer to their marriage as a ""starter marriage."" Eek.
