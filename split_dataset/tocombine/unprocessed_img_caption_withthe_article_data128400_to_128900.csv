When I made a paella using snails left over from last week's dish I wasn't being innovative at all: They're a venerable part of the Valencian repertoire. Nor was I breaking new ground when I saw that Jackie and I weren't eating that savoy cabbage in the fridge and decided to incorporate it into a first-course risotto for a group of friends. Cabbage risotto doesn't generally come to mind, but it crops up in various parts of Italy, sometimes in a vegetarian version but more often with a little meat for seasoning, most typically sausage meat or air-cured ham -- such as lightly smoked speck, which, for me, is the ideal partner for cabbage, as for so many other things.In the Old Country, the cabbage and the rice cook together, which makes for cabbage that has almost disappeared, texturally at any rate. I wanted it soft but recognizable, so I started the dish (which would serve six as a starter and two or three as a main course) by cooking 2 two-mitted handfuls of savoy cabbage that had been cut into strips less than half an inch wide and perhaps a couple of inches long (1 by 5cm or thereabouts). This I did in 2 tablespoons (25g) of butter and some salt in the pan that I'd be using to make the risotto, over medium heat. When it had wilted and shrunk in volume but was not fully cooked, I set it aside in a bowl to cool. (You can certainly use regular cabbage, but you might want to trim the thickest parts of the leaves and cut it into finer shreds.)In the same pan, still over medium heat, I placed another piece of butter and about two ounces (60g) of speck cut into matchsticks; when its fat became translucent I added the white and pale green parts of a medium leek that I'd previously cut into julienne shreds -- how you cut it isn't important, so long as it is sliced thin - washed and drained and seasoned with salt and black pepper. If I hadn't had a leek, I'd have used two shallots or a small onion.When the leeks were mostly cooked and the speck had begun slightly to brown -- such browning is not usual in risottos, but here it enhances the flavor of the ham and of the whole dish -- I added a cup of risotto rice (I almost always use carnaroli), stirred it around in the butter and speck fat for a minute, raised the heat just a wee bit and poured in a quarter cup (60ml) white wine, which quickly disappeared, some evaporating, some being absorbed by the rice.From this point, it was standard operating procedure: gradually adding lightly salted chicken stock diluted one-to-one with water (vegetable stock would have been fine), and stirring pretty much constantly, which I'm convinced enhances the viscosity of the risotto's liquid. When the rice was a minute or two from completion, I added the reserved cabbage and kept stirring, ladling in enough stock to yield a somewhat soupy dish: just on the border between eating with a fork and eating with a spoon. I checked for seasoning (the cabbage somehow made this rather salt-hungry), then vigorously stirred in a final lump of butter and just two tablespoonsful of grated Parmesan. (I topped each portion with a few oven-toasted walnuts for crunch and additional warm flavor. They were a real enhancement, but aren't really necessary.)The appeal of this dish is sneaky: At first spoonful, you may reach for the grated parmesan. But there won't be any on the table, because it's fine the way it is. The second spoonful, believe me, will put a smile on your face. There's a gentle sweetness in the cabbage -- and indeed in the leeks and the speck -- along with that slight funkiness that's part of the reason we love that vegetable. As noted, we ate it as a first course, but on a cold day it would be as comforting as a bowl of soup."

Can you tell?Dear Huffington Post Makeup Readers,No sleep? No worries! You don't need to hide just because you have not gotten enough rest! I often go without Zs, especially during fashion week when I pretty much have to be ""on"" around the clock. How do I remedy my exhausted look situation? Here are eight of my personal quick fix tips to brighten even the most tired of faces:Step 1: Perk yourself up with a five-minute Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Soap bath. Add plenty of this magic liquid soap to your tub, and you will be instantly revitalized and refreshed. (Important: Make sure to put your face in the water too!)Step 2: Add a few eye drops to each eye to take out the tired burn and redness. This alone really helps a lot.Step 3: Moisturize your face and neck with your favorite cream, tap some eye serum under and over your eyes and then SPRITZ your face and neck to death with rose water or Evian water mist. When you mist your face after creaming it, it not only wakes you up, but it hydrates the heck out of your exhausted skin which creates the perfect canvas to then add makeup.Step 4: Now that your skin is all aglow, counteract your exhausted look (which usually one can see under the eyes in the form of puffiness or dark circles) by distracting your audience's attention and playing up a different feature with a bright color: YOUR LIPS! Red lips, florissant lips, berry stain or gloss or both will immediately create a well-rested, happy illusion that can win any crowd. People will naturally only stare at your mouth when there is a bold color on it and that pulls focus away from your tired eyes. Of course add foundation, concealer, blush, mascara and whatever else you want, but keep the eye makeup simple and play up those lips!Nicole Bryl, Make-Up New York played up her lips here for an evening event to detract from a week of very little sleep.Step 5: Bronze up your skin! Tan skin always alludes to rest and vacation; it is another way to detract from looking tired. Bronzed skin combined with bright lips alone will make you look very well rested.Step 6: Make your hair look amazing! Even if it is neatly slicked back, when your hair looks groomed people are less likely to realize how tired your face looks.Step 7: Wear your favorite pair of slightly tinted sunglasses with those bright lips and tan skin. It's just a hot look in general, but it will block out all the extra light which can often irritate tired eyes.Step 8: Make sure to grab a bottle of water and a straw (not to ruin your lipstick) as you walk out your door and drink the whole thing down. When you are tired your face needs hydration, so DRINK LOTS OF WATER throughout the day!Check out: NB's BLOG for her list of can't live without beauty products!

3,PARENTING,Multiple Personality Parenting,"Mackenzie Lawrence, Contributor
Mom and blogger, RaisingWildThings.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/multiple-personality-parenting_us_5b9d5522e4b03a1dcc86befc,I parent each of my kids differently. I suppose you could call it multiple personality parenting. But I like to call it doing what's best for my kids. Each one of them. Individually.,2014-02-18,Their Baby Cuteness Doesn't Predict Adult Attractiveness ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9b03bb26000036007ef76b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Each of my kids has a different mom. Sort of. No, we didn't adopt. No, we didn't use surrogates. I definitely grew and birthed all three of them. Believe me, I remember. But I have a mommy confession: I parent each of my kids differently. I suppose you could call it multiple personality parenting. But I like to call it doing what's best for my kids. Each one of them. Individually.Before having kids, I knew exactly the type of parent I wanted to be. My hubby and I talked through everything. I was going to breastfeed. We weren't going to use binkies. We weren't going to introduce TV for the first two years. We'd make all of our own baby food. We wouldn't eat fast food. We weren't going to co-sleep. We weren't going to use spanking as a form of discipline. In other words, we had it all worked out. We were so pleased with the kick-ass parents we were going to be.And then we actually had a kid.And you know what? Aside from a few circumstances beyond our control (our first was born 11 weeks early and couldn't breastfeed, for example), we were pretty much able to be those kick-ass parents we dreamed of being. Belle* was such an easy baby. She slept well everywhere: in her crib, the swing, the pack 'n play. She ate well. She naturally fell into a sleeping and feeding schedule very early on. She travelled well. She hardly ever fussed. Looking back, it's no wonder we were able to be those ideal parents we had set out to be. We didn't have any resistance, and Belle's personality meshed so well with how we wanted to parent.And so we had a second kid.And boy, did this throw a monkey wrench into things. Enter Saurus*. I am not exaggerating when I say that he was the complete opposite of his sister in every single way as a baby. He was the king of fussy babies. He didn't sleep well. He cried all the time. We could never seem to get him on a consistent sleeping or feeding schedule. And god forbid we try to take him out of town. Or out to a restaurant, for that matter. Any time we'd start to make progress with him, something would happen to land us right back where we started.I was in shock. I was depressed. I was confused. I felt like a failure. And I was left analyzing every parenting philosophy that my husband and I swore to abide by and that worked with our first child. I felt like I was a first-time mom all over again. I had done all of this before. What the hell was the problem? What was I doing wrong?I started getting angry. And frustrated. I blamed my child. What was wrong with this kid? Why couldn't he just sleep like his sister? Why couldn't he eat like his sister? Why couldn't he be easygoing like his sister? Why was he making it so hard for me to parent him like I did with his sister?Because he wasn't his sister. BECAUSE HE WASN'T HIS SISTER!! This realization hit me like a ton of bricks. What the hell was I doing? Why was I trying to parent my children the same exact way when they clearly had very different needs?This was another ""aww, hell"" moment for me. I realized that the perfect, kick-ass parent I was able to be with Belle existed because that was the type of parent she needed. Saurus, on the other hand, needed me to be an entirely different parent. In many ways, the type of parent I had never intended on being. Where Belle was content to be put to bed awake and drift herself off to sleep without a peep, Saurus needed to be rocked, swayed and cuddled until he fell into a deep sleep and could finally be put into bed. Where Belle could sit in her swing and be content for 30 minutes to watch her little birdies fly 'round and 'round, Saurus couldn't stand to be in one place for more than five minutes at a time. Where Belle was independent, Saurus was clingy and needy.This was a difficult realization for me. One that was not apparent in the baby books I read or in the advice I was given from family and friends. Sure, the ""do what's best for you and your kids"" mantra was thrown around a lot -- heck, I've even shared that advice with people -- but the missing piece for me was that this mantra applies to each child. Individually: ""Do what's best for this kid. But also do what's best for that kid.""And then we had a third kid. And although at 1, he's just now coming into his own, we'll be parenting him the same way we parent our older two: By whatever methods work best for him.Don't get me wrong. My kids are not running around willy-nilly doing whatever the hell they want. We have rules and we have consequences for breaking the rules. We have expectations for our kids to behave in certain ways in certain circumstances, and we have consequences when this doesn't happen. But our approaches for fostering these behaviors are not the same for each of our kids.With Belle, for example, the mere mention that she might have to go to time-out is usually enough to get her behavior in check. With Saurus, we usually need to not only put him in time-out, but also take away a toy or privilege before he understands we mean business. With Belle, a hug and a quick kiss is usually all it takes to help her feel better when she is upset. With Saurus, we often have to hold him in a tight embrace until he is calm.And we'll do whatever works best for the baby... once we have some more time under our belts and learn what this is.What about consistency? What about being fair? How can you possibly parent your children so differently? Well, we're consistent when something works. And then when it doesn't, we find something else that does. Our consistency is always doing what is best for our children. And this seems pretty fair to me.I'm learning that as my kids get older, my parenting needs evolve every day, every second for each of my kids. Sometimes what's best for one kid is best for all. But sometimes, it isn't. And sometimes, what's best for one kid on one day isn't what's best for that kid on another day. And that's OK. At least for me. Because I know that ""I am exactly the kind of mother my children need."" Each and every one of them.This post was originally published on Mackenzie's blog Raising Wild Things.
