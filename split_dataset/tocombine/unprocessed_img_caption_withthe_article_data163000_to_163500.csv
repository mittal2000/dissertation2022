Garvey, a Jamaican born black nationalist, founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and spoke around the country urging blacks to embrace their race and culture by returning to Africa, their ancestral homeland. In 1919, he founded the Black Star Line to provide transportation to the continent.Ultimately, Garvey was arrested and later deported to Jamaica, but he remains known as the premier proponent of black pride and Pan-Africanism.

There were so many aspects of transitioning and being treated like a woman in society that I was totally unprepared for.",2013-02-18,2013-02-16-Ohareyoutwosisters__Microagressions1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-02-16-Ohareyoutwosisters__Microagressions1.jpg,"Exactly two years ago, I sat apprehensively in the reception area of the public health clinic in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood, waiting for my name to be called. If all went according to plan, I would leave that evening with my first prescriptions for estradiol and spironolactone -- day 1 on hormones. I had just come from work, and because only a handful of my colleagues knew about my transition, I was still presenting as a boy (albeit an androgynous one wearing gold eye shadow). I remember looking around the room at the other trans girls sitting nearby. I couldn't wait to be just like them -- to have people see me as my true gender and to finally start feeling comfortable in my body.It was hard to believe that I had been closeted only two months earlier, and yet here I was, about to embrace the part of myself that I had been ashamed of for nearly all my life. I was ready. Since coming out, I had pored through several radical gender books, watched transition videos on YouTube and researched the hormones I was about to take. I knew what to expect in the weeks and months ahead.Day 1 on hormonesTwo years and 4,860 pills later, I now realize how little I actually understood back then. There were so many aspects of transitioning and being treated like a woman in society that I was totally unprepared for. And today I'd like to share 10 lessons that I wish I had known in February 2011.(Note: This advice is based on my own personal experience as a queer, femme, white, upper-middle-class trans girl with ""passing privilege,"" so some of it might not be applicable to you.)1. Brace yourself for beauty culture.This is especially true for my fellow femme girls, and there's a reason it's #1 on my list. Before I started presenting as female, I had no idea just how toxic beauty culture is in this country. Women are constantly inundated with airbrushed images and messages aiming to tear down our self-esteem and make us feel inadequate. Fashion magazines and the beauty industry make billions every year by exploiting these insecurities with the promise that if we only try harder to be prettier, we too can be happy.As a trans girl, beauty culture can be especially difficult to navigate, because most of us have haven't been exposed to it very long. Our cis partners and friends have been dealing with it since middle school (if not earlier), and many have had years to develop effective coping strategies, so we DMAB (""designated male at birth"") ladies have to make up for lost time, and on top of that, cissexist standards of beauty add another way for us to feel insecure.It helps to maintain a sense of perspective. Many trans girls, including me, have a habit of romanticizing the cisgender experience. A month or two into my transition, I told my girlfriend that I couldn't wait until I could look in the mirror and see a pretty girl staring back at me. ""You realize that's never going to happen, right?"" was her response. ""You're going to look at your reflection and feel unsatisfied -- just like every other woman."" And it's true: Even the most gorgeous of my friends can list a dozen things she'd change about her appearance. So the next time you're feeling unattractive, don't blame yourself; blame capitalism and a beauty culture designed to make you feel that way.2. Say goodbye to male privilege.If, like me, you presented as a normative guy before transitioning, you probably didn't realize just how many privileges you were about to give up. I took so many little things for granted, like being able to walk outside or go to a bar without random men feeling the need to comment on my appearance. Sexual harassment is such a routine thing now that I can't even remember what life was like without it.You'll probably also notice that people take you less seriously at work because of your gender and presentation. You'll have to be twice as assertive as you were before in order to get people to pay attention to your contributions, and you'll possibly be labeled a ""bitch"" for doing so.3. People will surprise you.Coming out as trans* is a great way to find out who your true friends are, and it's not always the people you'd first suspect. In my experience, if someone is a fundamentally good person, they will almost always be accepting, despite any religious or political misinformation about trans* people they may have learned. It's a lot harder to otherize being trans* when you know a trans* person personally. So try to give people the benefit of the doubt when coming out to them; you'll probably be pleasantly surprised.4. Prepare for (micro)aggressions.I grew up in a mostly white, conservative suburb where my family was considered ""middle-class"" because we didn't have a house on the water or a yacht. In other words, I lived in such a privileged bubble that I had never even heard of microaggressions until I started experiencing them after coming out. If, like me, you were presenting as a heternormative white boy before transitioning, these can seem a little jarring at first, but it's something that nearly everyone but straight, white cis men have to deal with on a regular basis. So what are microaggressions, exactly? In my case, it's every time a well-intentioned friend posts an article about a trans* person on my wall or remarks on my physical changes since the last time they saw me, or every time someone asks if my girlfriend and I are sisters (even if we're holding hands). It's the little interactions that happen every day that remind you that you are ""different"" in some way.(Unfortunately, many trans* people, especially trans women of color, face more than just microaggressions. They are often subjected to discrimination, violence and institutional hostility. I realize that I am incredibly privileged, and in no way am I trying to diminish the struggles of others, but microaggressions are still unpleasant and something that I was not prepared for.)""Oh, are you two sisters?""5. Go to therapy.Seriously, you should go to therapy. I don't think it should be required to ""prove"" your gender before starting hormones, but it's something that I'd recommend for every person going through transition. It's an incredibly emotional time, full of triumphs and setbacks and too many feelings to process all by yourself, so take care of your mental health by discussing them with a therapist. I didn't start seeing one until more than seven months into my transition, and in hindsight I think that waiting as long as I did was a mistake.6. Pursue other interests.Transitioning is such a monumental undertaking that it's easy to let it consume all the other aspects of your life if you're not careful. That's why it's important to maintain other hobbies and interests during this time. Make time to read books that have nothing to do with gender, listen to music, learn a new language, go for a walk, you name it. The important thing is to take a break from thinking about being trans*, even for an hour or two. You'll start to drive yourself crazy after a while if you don't.7. Take a deep breath and be patient.Hormones are incredible, but they take time to work their magic. You're not going to notice results overnight. When I first started HRT, I couldn't wait for the weeks and months to go by. I looked forward to each new dose, because it meant that I was one step closer to feeling comfortable in my own body. I fantasized about ways to fast-forward the next couple of years so that I could finally start enjoying life as my true self. But in constantly looking to the future, I often neglected all the amazing and wonderful things happening around me. I found it hard to simply be in the moment.My girlfriend and I have recently started practicing mindfulness meditation, and it's been a really useful tool to help me stay present. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to slow time down and experience life in the moment. A little anticipation can be a good thing, but our life will pass us by if we're only focused on what lies ahead.8. Save money.Transitioning is really expensive. Currently only a handful of insurance companies offer trans*-inclusive health care benefits, which means that many people have to pay for medications, lab tests and doctor's visits out of pocket. Laser hair removal and electrolysis are also quite pricey and are never covered by insurance, because they are considered ""cosmetic"" procedures. Changing your legal name and gender in California will set you back at least another $500. And buying an entirely new wardrobe isn't cheap, either. Bottom line: Start saving now. Your future self will thank you for it.9. Don't expect transitioning to solve all your problems.When I was still closeted, I often blamed every unpleasant experience or emotion on the fact that I had to pretend to be a boy. ""One day,"" I would tell myself, ""I'll be able to finally be myself, and I'll be pretty and carefree and never have to deal with this again."" And it's true that transitioning has made a lot of things better. I connect on a much deeper level with my girlfriend and other people. I'm a kinder and more empathetic person. Little things like painting my nails and getting to express myself through fashion make my days more colorful and enjoyable. I'm so much happier now that I'm no longer hiding who I really am.But transitioning is not a panacea; it won't solve all your problems. If you were prone to anxiety before coming out, you'll probably still have to deal with it afterwards. I still sometimes get in stupid arguments with my girlfriend for no good reason, just like I did two years ago. I'm still addicted to caffeine, and I sometimes forget to turn the lights off when I leave my apartment in the morning. At some point in my transition, I came to terms with the fact that living as my true gender wouldn't magically fix everything. And it felt really good to let go of that impossible expectation.10. You do you.Most trans* people spend years pretending to be someone we aren't in order to please others: our parents, our friends, our classmates or society in general. And most of us make ourselves miserable because of it. With each passing day, it gets harder for me to remember what it was like to interact with a world that perceived me as a boy, but I'll never forget how exhausting it felt to be cast as the wrong character in a seemingly never-ending play.Before coming out as trans*, I never allowed myself to fully relax. I constantly policed my gender presentation and mannerisms to make sure that I wouldn't raise suspicion. I was terrified that someone would learn the truth about my gender. But one thing that transitioning has taught me is that life is too short to worry about what others think of you. There are more than 7 billion people on this planet, and some of them are inevitably going to disapprove of you and your life choices. For me, the decision is simple: I'd rather face the possibility of rejection then spend another minute in the closet.Most people don't ever get the chance to spontaneously and completely reinvent themselves, but trans* people do. Take advantage of this opportunity by being the most authentic you that you can be, and don't worry about trying to conform to society's expectations of how someone like you is ""supposed to"" look or act. If you're a trans girl who enjoys rugby and hates dresses, don't let anyone try to deny the validity of your gender. If you're a trans guy who loves sparkles and makeup, own it. And if you're trans* but don't feel comfortable in either binary category of ""male"" or ""female,"" resist the pressure to pick one. Be proud of who you are, and don't be afraid to show it. You deserve to live an authentic life.* * * * *So there you have it, 10 things that I wish I'd learned before embarking on the incredible adventure of the past two years. There are many others that didn't make the list, such as realizing that girls can sometimes be just as gross as guys. (I thought the transition would mean an end to unpleasant public bathrooms, but I was wrong.) I'm undoubtedly still learning; I don't claim to have everything figured out at this point. But my two-year anniversary on hormones seems like the perfect time to begin the next chapter of my life, a chapter that focuses less on my gender and the fact that I was DMAB.A version of this blog post originally appeared on Autostraddle.

We have updated our numbers to reflect the earnings of the still-living presidents. One thing remains clear: it pays to be president, especially after leaving office. 24/7 Wall St. examined the finances of all 43 presidents to identify the richest.  In our updated list, the only currently living president who makes the wealthiest list is Bill Clinton, who now has an estimated net worth of $55 million. Clinton continues to make millions of dollars in speaking fees. This January, following an email from Bill Clinton to supporters, Hilary Clinton’s 2008 campaign debt was paid off.Click here to see The Ten Richest PresidentsPresident Obama is not one of the wealthiest presidents of all times. Yet his net worth increased from $5 million in 2010 to an estimated $7 million, primarily from his book sales. If Bill Clinton is any indication, Obama can expect to make much more money in speaking engagements once he exits office in 2017.The net worth of the presidents varies widely. George Washington amassed over half a billion in today’s dollars, while other presidents went bankrupt. The fortunes of America’s presidents are often tied to the economy of their time. Over time, as the focus of the economy has changed, so has the way the presidents made their money.It is not surprising then to find that the first few presidents — from Washington’s election to about 75 years later — were large landowners. They generally made money from land, crops and commodity speculation. Of course, this left them highly vulnerable to poor crop yields, and they could lose most or all of their properties because of a few bad years. Similarly, they could lose all of their money through land speculation — leveraging the value of one piece of land to buy additional property.By 1850, the financial history of the presidency entered a new era. Beginning with Millard Fillmore, most presidents were lawyers who spent years in public service. They rarely amassed large fortunes and their incomes often came almost entirely from their salaries. These American presidents were distinctly middle class and often retired without the means to support themselves in anyway close to the presidential lifestyle. Buchanan, Lincoln, Johnson, Grant, Hayes and Garfield had modest net worths when they died.At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, there was another significant change to the economy. Large, professionally organized corporations in the oil, mining, financial and railroad sectors allowed individuals to amass large fortunes. The Kennedys were wealthy because of the financial empire built by Joseph Kennedy. Herbert Hoover made millions of dollars as the owner of mining companies. Indeed, since the early 20th century, the fortunes of many presidents, including Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and both of the Bushes were driven by inherited wealth.The net worth figures for the 10 wealthiest presidents are in 2010 dollars. Because several of the presidents, particularly in the early 19th century, made and lost huge fortunes in a matter of a few years, the net worth of each president is for the peak time. The exception to the 2010 rule are the presidents who are still living, who have more recent earnings. In the case of each president, we have taken into account hard assets such as land, estimated lifetime savings based on work history, inheritance and homes. Wages considered were earned for services as varied as collector of customs at the Port of New York to royalties on books, as well as ownership of companies and yields from family estates.This is 24/7 Wall St.’s list of the richest U.S. presidents.

""It's really too close to tell,"" said Tom McCarty, president of SPEEA.Goforth said: ""The vote is going to be 60-40, but I don't know which way.""At stake is an estimated $200 million a month in cash that Boeing is losing by not delivering the 787, which is grounded until a fix for its burning battery problem is found and regulators approve it.A walkout by engineers also could slow or halt production on Boeing's other airplane lines for the 737, 777, 767 and 747, several of which have been speeded up to capitalize on a huge book of orders.BIG RISKSCritics say Goforth's more aggressive approach has put SPEEA in a difficult position. If members reject the contract and approve the strike authorization, they are hurting Boeing when it newest aircraft needs them. But if members do not vote that way, they are defying the recommendations of its leaders, flouting Goforth.""Goforth has billed this as a low-risk way to get Boeing back to the bargaining table,"" said Doug Alder, a Boeing spokesman. ""We don't see it that way.""Governor Jay Inslee of Washington state, where Boeing does nearly all of its aircraft manufacturing, is also worried about any disruption. ""Both partners have a responsibility to prevent that,"" he said, referring to Boeing and the union.Some criticism of SPEEA has cropped up on local Internet message boards. ""I will accept this final offer hands down and try to put these childish and embarrassing negotiations behind us,"" a poster identifying himself as a SPEEA engineer wrote in commenting on a recent Seattle Times story about the union vote.He criticized SPEEA for rejecting a lucrative contract with 5 percent annual raises during tough economic times.McCarty, the SPEEA president, said the offer is ""a lot better than it was initially, thanks to our efforts. I don't think we should be embarrassed. We moved the company past their comfort zone.""The sticking point is Boeing's insistence on putting new hires into a defined-contribution retirement plan instead of the traditional pension SPEEA members have. SPEEA said the new plan pays 40 percent less over a 30-year career. Boeing says it believes the union is undervaluing the plan.Goforth contends that despite the 787 problems, Boeing is living through a modern-day gold rush. High oil prices and easy financing have spurred airlines to order record numbers of new, fuel-efficient planes. Boeing is speeding up its factories to deliver them as fast as possible.With Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, Goforth, 45, has given the union a social media presence. But he says his actions simply reflect the will of the members, whose views filter up through the democratic structure of the union. ""Because I'm the public face, people have the mistaken impression that I run things,"" he says. ""None of these decisions are taken by me or the executive committee."" NEW TONEAs the first non-engineer to run SPEEA in more than 20 years, Goforth is able to take a stronger stance. Prior leaders were engineers on leave from Boeing to run the union, and had some worried about their own careers, union members say.""Ray is very focused on what's good for the members,"" said SPEEA Council Chairman Joel Funfar.He's not afraid to play hardball with the company. Some say the company views him as the devil, but it allows the union to play good-cop, bad-cop during negotiations, said McCarty.""Ray can go right up to the line and step over it if he feels it's appropriate, and not be intimidated or concerned about how it will affect his career,"" he said.A transplant to the Northwest from California, Goforth majored in political economy at Evergreen State College with a focus on post-industrial economic systems. He then earned a doctorate degree in international and comparative law at the University of Washington.He has large brown eyes that reflect his quiet, thoughtful demeanor. His belief in justice is so strong that he gave his three children that word as their middle name. In the mid-1990s, he worked for several years at the state attorney general's education office, where he negotiated on Washington's behalf against the state-worker unions at state colleges and universities.Millicent Newhouse, who was Goforth's supervisor then, said his sympathies were with the opposing side. ""To his credit, I recall him being very capable of doing the job,"" she said. ""But I think on personal level it wasn't always easy to do.""He became SPEEA executive director in 2008, after 10 years at Professional and Technical Employees Local 17, a union representing public-sector engineers and information technology experts.Goforth sees unions as a crucial check on corporate power, and reflecting the members views. In October, SPEEA members rejected Boeing's early contract by a 96 percent margin.Goforth said he does not view the vote as either win or lose for the union leadership. He said members recently gave him a standing ovation for negotiating a good deal. ""And some of them were saying, 'I'm voting yes to the contract.'""Ultimately, it is the members' call, he said. ""If they reject it, we'll go back to the bargaining table. If they accept, then it's job well done and we move on."""

The divergence complicates the ECB's interest rate-setting plans.The Bundesbank data released on Monday showed that German banks owed the central bank 49.5 billion euros ($66.1 billion) at end-January, 23.6 billion less than a month earlier, suggesting they took advantage of the first opportunity to pay back the 3-year loans to the ECB, known as LTROs, on Jan. 30.Most - 20.6 billion euros - of the fall came in German banks' use of longer-term facilities, which cover anything from one month to three years.The ECB gave banks the ultra-long term loans in two instalments roughly a year ago, with euro zone lenders taking more than a trillion euros in cheap cash.In the first of the twin loans, offered in December 2011, banks took 489 billion euros. In the first opportunity to pay back those loans early, banks returned 137.2 billion euros to the Eurosystem of euro zone central banks on Jan. 30.Banks with market access can get overnight funds at 0.06 percent, while the interest rate for 3-month loans is 0.223 percent. CORE CONFIDENCEECB President Mario Draghi said earlier this month that the financial market conditions had improved significantly and that the early repayments were ""a sign of confidence"".""Many banks had accessed (3-year) LTRO for precautionary reasons because they were, a year ago, uncertain about the liquidity situation - about the funding prospects. And now they are less uncertain, than they were a year ago. So, that is also a positive sign,"" Draghi said in a post-rate decision news conference.National central bank balance sheets showed, however, that a lion's share of funds paid back came from core countries of Germany, France and Belgium, and that peripheral countries' banks continue to rely to great extent on the central bank for funds.This complicates the ECB's task of setting interest rates suitable for the whole block, as its policy decisions do not get transmitted in the same form to all countries.The ECB has announced a yet-to-be-activated bond-buying programme, dubbed Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT), to address the issue.While the plan has calmed worst fears in the market, ECB lending data shows that national divergence still looms large.The use of ECB lending also went down considerably in France and Belgium, data from their national central banks showed.French banks' use of ECB facilities was 152.7 billion euros on Feb. 12, down from 179 billion a month earlier. Virtually all of the reduction came from longer-term refinancing operations, which was cut by 25.6 billion.Belgian banks chopped off a quarter of their borrowing from the ECB, which went down to 29.2 billion euros at end-January from 40 billion at the end of last year.By contrast, Italian banks used the facilities more at the end of January, taking 273.9 billion, up from 271.8 billion. Italian banks' share of total ECB lending rose to 27 percent from just above 24 percent.In Spain, which together with Italy has been drawn deeper into the centre of the debt crisis, banks used the central bank for funds almost as much in January as a month earlier.They took 346 billion euros from the central bank, down from 357.3 billion, but they remained the heaviest users of the ECB, with their share amounting to 34.1 percent.Banks in countries hit hardest by the debt crisis, especially in Greece and Ireland, rely on emergency liquidity assistance from their national central banks, as they lack suitable collateral to access regular ECB operations.($1 = 0.7490 euros) (Reporting by Sakari Suoninen, editing by Paul Carrel and Philippa Fletcher)"

(Photo by Larry Busacca/Getty Images For The Eagles)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb416902400005100977c07.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 1972, I was the singles reviewer for the music trade Record World. It was an awesome job, but someone had to do it.There were lots of mediocre records to plow through, but what a thrill it was when a clear-cut hit arrived -- like Carly Simon's ""You're So Vain,"" ""Oh, Girl"" by the Chi Lites and ""Take It Easy,"" the first single from the Eagles. The breezy, hooky ""Take it Easy,"" written by Jackson Browne (the ""Winslow, Arizona"" verse was added by Eagle Glenn Frey), distilled the California country rock sound pioneered by such winged-mates as the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers. The Eagles -- Frey, Don Henley, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner -- soon scored again with the spooky ""Witchy Woman."" Their third straight 1972 hit, ""Peaceful Easy Feeling,"" assured their place in history as the only act to have two ""Easy"" chartmakers in the same year.I asked Henley whether the band knew they had a hit with ""Take It Easy."" He said, ""We had no idea what would happen. We were pretty sure that we had made a compelling recording, but you never really know what is going to be a hit. There are so many other factors besides the music."" Once the record began to surge, he added, ""We couldn't believe it was really happening. We kept waiting for the bad news, but the single just kept climbing up the charts. We had a few brief, celebratory moments, but mainly we just kept working. We were always thinking about what to do next. It was important not to lose momentum.""Later in '72, my Record World colleague John Gibson (yes, that John Gibson; he was a great guy and a great reporter) joined his then-wife Sandy in the greenback pastures of Atlantic Records, which distributed David Geffen's Asylum label, where the Eagles nested. Les Gibsons took me and the guys to dinner at the fabulous Café Nicholson near Manhattan's groovy 59th Street Bridge, and it was clear they were hell-bent on taking their enterprise to the limit.Fast forward 40 years to this week's airing of History Of The Eagles, an eye-opening two-part documentary produced by Oscar- and Grammy-winning documentarian Alex Gibney  and directed by his frequent collaborator Alison Ellwood, which bowed impressively at Sundance and debuted on Showtime February 15 and 16.Part I draws from scads of material, including vintage footage beginning several years B.E. (before Eagles). In a sequence worthy of the St. Hubbins/Tufnel Spinal Tap back story, we learn that among the bands for whom Henley and/or Frey toiled were the Mushrooms, The Four of Us, The Heavy Metal Kids, the Subterraneans, Longbranch Pennywhistle, The Four Speeds and Shiloh.Spoiler alert: Frey recalls that he learned the value of relentless attention to detail in songwriting courtesy of Jackson Browne, who lived in a crummy Echo Park studio below the crummy digs Frey shared with fellow mellow man J.D. Souther, who would later co-write such Eagles standards as ""Best of My Love,"" ""Victim of Love,"" ""Heartache Tonight"" and ""New Kid in Town."" Early each morning and punctuated only by the occasional tea whistle, Browne played and sang the same riffs ad infinitum until they were perfect. It was, for Frey, as valuable as it was annoying.During pre-production of the Eagles' eponymous debut album, famed producer Glyn Johns (The Faces, The Who, The Stones) was not crazy about the group until, at a certain moment, he grokked the distinctive, crystalline blend of voices that would propel them to superstardom.Henley and Frey were anything but mellow when it came to their careers. Their desire to rock out led to the laid-back Leadon's departure and the arrival of Joe Walsh, a certified power guitarist and one of the funniest musicians ever to grace a stage. (Turn off the volume and watch the film's concert footage of Walsh in action and you will laugh out loud.) Of course, there's a boatload of pain -- and redemption -- in Walsh's story, which plays out in Part II.As much as Henley and Frey defined the Eagles, erstwhile members Leadon, Meisner and Don Felder and current bandmate Timothy B. Schmit contributed mightily, and each gets to tell his unvarnished story. The band reached its highest altitude during the mid to late 1970s, when the single and album  Hotel California cemented what Rolling Stone called their ""note-perfect Hollywood-cowboy ennui."" Gibney's film draws on excellent footage from a 1977 concert in Washington, D.C. which features the memorable dueling guitars of Walsh and Felder at the end of a chilling ""Hotel California.""By 1980, the Eagles were done and the record industry was in a pre-MTV, pre-CD tailspin. Fourteen years later, the band reunited with their current lineup: Henley, Frey, Walsh and Schmit. What happened during the past 30 years is the subject of History Part II.Wendy (aka my wife) is a long-time, passionate Eagles-lover whose enthusiasm became infectious as we watched a screening of Part I together. By the film's end, I appreciated the group more than ever.Difficulties notwithstanding, Henley says, ""All of it was fun. For me, hearing a song we'd written come to fruition in the recording studio was very gratifying, and then, of course, hearing it on the radio. Being onstage before a crowd of enthusiastic fans was a real rush, too ... and still is. Best job in the world."" Except maybe for being a singles reviewer, circa 1972."

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb417903c000066000c8391.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Saturday night, Beyoncé, birth-giver to our future overlord Blue Ivy Carter, capped off what can only be described as a month-long media invasion with the premiere of her self-directed ""documentary"" on HBO, Life Is But a Dream. I put the word ""documentary"" in quotation marks because, to the extent that a documentary is supposed to reveal a candid truth about its subject, a truth that can often only be sussed out by the presence of a third-party filmmaker, Life Is But a Dream is certainly not one. Really, the film sees Beyoncé, who, at this point, is known as much for her authoritarian control over her image as for her talent, playing a bit of a clever trick on her devoted following: We're ostensibly getting a view into the ""real"" Beyoncé, but only the version of ""real"" that she has decided we're allowed to lay our non-Shawn-Carter retinas on. In fact, the biggest revelations about the ultra-private superstar in Dream are that, yes, she too gets sad, lonely and scared sometimes (breaking news: Beyoncé is not an animatronic robot!); that she loves her daughter and her family (um, no duh!); and that she and Jigga, a man who once rapped, ""I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em, cuz I don't fuckin' need 'em,"" also have super-dorky sing-a-longs to Coldplay's ""Yellow"" after a few Pinot Grigios. But the aforementioned Coldplay karaoke moment, while admittedly an extraordinarily touching, genuine and intimate moment, is about as deep as Bey gets in the film. What really makes this woman tick is still a complete and utter mystery, which I'm pretty sure is just how Beyoncé likes it. Or is it? Of course, the thing is that when I sat down to watch Life Is But a Dream with a bunch of other mega Bey fans (just to be clear: I own every record, have gone to every electrifying tour and know the entire ""Single Ladies"" dance, step for step, and will gladly perform it upon request), I knew we weren't going to get much. This is Beyoncé, after all. It isn't like she just woke up one morning and completely changed from the person who spent an entire decade denying her blatant romance with her now-husband. I wasn't expecting her to show up on HBO, shit-talk about Michelle Williams' lack of talent, girl-talk with us about Jay's favorite sex position and tell us what really went down between her and her Svengali father when she fired him as her manager. (She claims that she was searching for ""independence,"" but we all know the child-star/stage-parent relationship is endlessly laden with complex emotions.) But all that is what leads me to my main question: If you're not really letting us in, why even make this ""documentary"" in the first place?One of Beyoncé's most endearing qualities has always been the old-school mystique she has managed to maintain in the information age, a glamorous allure that has truly kept the focus primarily on her art. While her pop-star kin Rihanna, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry, like the rest of us laypeople, social media till their fingers bleed, until six months ago it was unclear whether Beyoncé even knew what Twitter or Facebook was -- which, when you think about it, is really kind of amazing and singularly charming. Indeed, Beyoncé has never built her name on being on the cutting edge of anything, including technology. Unlike the other ladies, Beyoncé doesn't need to portray ""cool""-ness in order to attract our attention and garner our adoration: While we're certainly curious about her personal life, we love her primarily for her formidable talents as a singer and performer and for her class and grace as a superstar. Even her music and dancing often unabashedly reference the sounds and styles of the past rather than being on the vanguard of the future: the blaring Chi-Lite horns of ""Crazy in Love,"" the Fosse steps that inspired the ""Single Ladies"" dance and the Tina Turner pumps she performs it in, and the traditional stance toward heterosexual love and sex that she often espouses (she sings in ""Upgrade U,"" ""It's very seldom that you're blessed to find you're equal / Still play my part but let you take the lead role, believe me."") But with that said, there is also no denying that the world has changed immensely since Beyoncé first broke through as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child in the late '90s. In 2013 we demand much more on a personal level from our pop stars, a demand that the majority of Beyoncé's contemporaries seem more than happy to meet. It is not enough for them to merely put out an album, tour and do label-sanctioned interviews with Rolling Stone and Vogue. We want access, or at least the appearance of access, to their day-to-day lives through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and the like. The other important truth of note is that, though a truly accomplished and thrilling listen, Beyoncé's last record, 2011's 4, was her first that not only failed to produce a number-1 single but contained not one song that cracked the top 15. The record sold about a third of what her prior release, the far-inferior I Am... Sasha Fierce, did in 2008.For a while, I was certain that Beyoncé was going to maintain her defiance on the social media front. Then, in the middle of last year, following the relatively soft sales of 4, she joined Tumblr, releasing a series of personal (albeit highly controlled) images of herself and her family. I was shocked. Later that year she joined Instagram, a platform dominated by a woman on the complete opposite of the pop-star spectrum, Beyoncé's primary foil in PopStarVille: Rihanna. I was floored. Was this the same Beyoncé who was not even seen in public with her boyfriend until six years into their romance? In contrast to Bey, Rihanna is a mediocre singer and dancer, but her music is very much rooted in in the now: She is a cool kid, and she is the most cutting-edge of her pop-superstar ilk. Rihanna also allows ample glimpses into her personal life through social media. She tweets, unfiltered, often 20 or 30 times a day and Instagrams pictures of herself smoking blunts, sticking her face in strippers' behinds and waking up with sex-face after spending a drunken night with her former abuser, Chris Brown (which, yuck). She also openly discusses her lack of desire to be viewed as a role model and her pursuit of the freedom to live her life and make mistakes, even if it means doing so in the public eye. By joining Instagram, Beyoncé is clearly admitting that Rihanna is onto something, and she's right: Since Beyoncé last reached the top 10 as a lead artist, Rihanna has graced the top 10 no fewer than 14 times. But Bey also knows that she is not Rihanna on a myriad of fronts. Unlike Rihanna, still a young woman on the ascent, Beyoncé exists in a weird space in her career, somewhere between contemporary pop star and living legend. This, coupled with her immense control issues, is where Bey is getting confused and may have even lost her way. Whereas Rihanna's social media presence presents her as highly flawed but genuinely intriguing and authentic, qualities that add to her overall appeal as an artist, Beyoncé's, much like Life Is But a Dream, comes off as a stiff, surface-level imitation, a portrait of a woman who can't ever fully let go of control and let her ""freak flag fly."" There is nothing ""candid"" about it. Sure, we are seeing her backstage at a show, but she is in full hair and makeup, posing for a picture clearly taken on a professional camera and selected to make her appear as perfectly untouchable as possible.So here's my thought: If Beyoncé just accepted her role as the pop star who stands for old-school values and avoids social media and so-called documentaries, she may be taking a commercial risk but also would be staying true to her values. She would therefore be portraying a more inherently authentic version of who she she truly is: a private person whose art speaks for itself. The real truth implicit in her stilted attempts at ""revealing"" herself actually lies outside the world of filtered pictures and this odd film. The truth is that Beyoncé doesn't know exactly who she is and where she fits in the modern pop landscape, and she's a little freaked. In an interview that aired before the documentary, she disclosed to Oprah that releasing the documentary was a ""really hard choice to make,"" a reluctance that is evident in the fact that she really doesn't ""document"" anything too vulnerable that we didn't already know about. The irony is that by attempting to reveal things but not actual reveal anything, Beyoncé is giving us the most blunt truth we've ever come to know about her: She is scared to let people know who she is, and she is petrified of losing of control of her image, but she is even more horrified by the notion of irrelevance, scared enough to at least attempt to make us feel like she is playing the ""get to know the real me"" game without actually playing it. Beyoncé, as an adoring fan, let me give you a little sage advice: Just be your dorky, control-freak, uncool but supremely gifted self and ditch this trendy shit. Rihanna needs to show us pictures of her blazing up and looking forlorn with Breezy, because she doesn't bring a ton of talent to the table. You have more to offer artistically in one flip of your glorious weave than Rihanna does in an entire lifetime of number-1 hits. Be that old-world star whom we don't know much about beyond what you present in your music. We may be frustrated and want more, but as you say in Life Is But a Dream, dissatisfaction is what drives us through life. When you're onstage, you give us more than enough of the ""real"" you. When you're onstage, I believe there is a God. That is enough. No need for sepia-toned Instagrams appearing in my feed next to snaps of Rih's pasties and my douchey friend's brunches. It's beneath you. And certainly no more of your ""documentaries."" That is just not you. I'm totally good with that. Are you? "

The problem was, reportedly, that Sony wanted a 2011 release date and Raimi felt he couldn't deliver a quality product before that date. The fourth ""Spider-Man"" was canceled, replaced with a 2012 reboot, ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" directed by Marc Webb.On Sunday, we spoke to Raimi who is promoting his new film, ""Oz: The Great and Powerful."" (The full interview will publish closer to the film's March 8 release.) While discussing a host of topics (""For Love of the Game"" and ""A Simple Plan"" were discussed at length), the subject turned to Spider-Man. Specifically, if he had had a chance to see Marc Webb's new interpretation.I remember a quote about how you were concerned about how you introduced Gwen Stacy in ""Spider-Man 3."" Stacy is introduced first in the new version. Have you seen ""The Amazing Spider-Man""? Well, I'm a big Marc Webb fan and a giant fan of Emma Stone. And of Andrew Garfield. I saw him on Broadway in ""Death of a Salesman"" -- it's just brilliant. And I love the producers of that movie because they are dear friends, and the writer. But, I haven't had the guts to go see the movie yet. Because I don't want to go to my girlfriend's wedding. I just can't bring myself to do it. I don't have the guts. But, I hear it's great. My wife even loved the picture and said it was a wonderful, excellently produced, beautifully acted, brilliantly written Spider-Man picture. She'd tell me the truth and that's what she said.Is it a weird position to be in? There seemed to be a sense, at first, that he and the new film were in your shadow. I don't feel he was in my shadow at all. I think I handed the torch to Marc and I hear that he ran with it and succeeded and made a brilliant picture. I'm happy for him and all the team. And I only wish him the best and I salute them because it's a tough job, too. And obviously he's pleased the fans -- so, I'm proud for him. I'm happy for my friends on the picture.Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment. You can contact him directly on Twitter."

Clearly Weddings Unveiled is afraid of alienating their straight audience. They have a business. I get it. But the millennial generation, the majority of those planning weddings, overwhelmingly support same-sex marriage. In one study, 68 percent of American millennials supported same-sex marriage.Still, there are examples of businesses that would rather not support these fabulous gay weddings. There's the bakery in Oregon that refused a wedding cake to a lesbian couple. There's the transportation company in Maryland that decided not to service ANY weddings rather than complying with the state requirement that they now service same-sex weddings. There's the venue in upstate New York that told a lesbian couple to go elsewhere. And so on. Many other businesses suddenly get all booked up when they realize they're talking to a same-sex couple. Others don't return calls and e-mails regarding gay weddings. This stuff happens all the time and I'm thrilled to see some press about it. I'm also pleased with how Weddings Unveiled quickly and sincerely responded: The issue is very sensitive and it is also very divided. We knew that it was possible that people would be offended if we published the ad and we knew that it was possible that people would be offended if we did not. We are so sorry that we acted out of fear and uncertainty. We had never been faced with such a decision and we should have acted with our hearts.Because as Anne so beautifully said to Weddings Unveiled, ""I hope you will see it through the eyes of history, for surely someday very soon your decision will seem archaic and absurd.""

But what about when the offspring in question happens to be the coolest girl in attendance? That's something we hadn't seen before today.Anais Gallagher, daughter of Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher and Meg Matthews, sat front and center during yesterday's Moschino Cheap & Chic show during London Fashion Week. The 13-year-old was pretty hard to miss in her aqua blue silk pajamas, high heels and heart-shaped sunglasses. Way to tap into our tween dream wardrobe, Anais.Of course, the duds in question were actually Moschino pieces sent directly to the cute youngster by the label. Former child star Miley Cyrus even showed her support for the look after Moschino tweeted a photo of Anais at the show. Miley's response? ""You know I die for this!!!!!!"" Plus, Anais actually has some fashion cred. She's already signed to Select Model Management and has been snapped by Mario Testino. No wonder she's able to hold her own next to London's fashion set. In other words, her seat mates better watch their backs -- ahem Daisy Lowe.

What better way to celebrate Black History Month than by taking a moment to acknowledge the snapshots of time that represent the struggle and triumph of African-Americans through the years?As part of our Black History Month coverage, we will be featuring one photo a day that honors years of groundbreaking achievements within the black community. These photos bring tears to our eyes, instill pride in our hearts and motivate us to carry on the legacy of strength and perseverance.Today's photo was taken on December 5, 1955, the first day of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The movement, an immediate reaction to Rosa Parks' arrest on Dec. 1, after she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger, was initially planned as a one-day protest to mark Parks' appearance in court. It ultimately lasted 381 days. To this day, the protest is seen as the catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement and the first step in realizing the monumental goals of the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court case.
