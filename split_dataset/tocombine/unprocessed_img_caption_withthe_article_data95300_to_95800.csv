0,POLITICS,Will The Marathon Trial Re-Traumatize Boston?,"David Freudberg, ContributorHost of the public radio series “Humankind”",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/will-the-marathon-trial-re-traumatize-boston_b_6795542.html,"As the trial recreates the crime and its repercussions in devastating detail, one concern is the likelihood that Boston will be traumatized all over again and that deep emotional wounds that victims have worked hard to heal will inevitably be torn back open.",2015-03-04,2015-03-03-1425422327-95206-Gertnerphotocloseupheadshot.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-03-1425422327-95206-Gertnerphotocloseupheadshot.jpg,"The memory of John Adams will hover over the courtroom of U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. Wednesday in Boston, where the trial of accused Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will finally commence.In 1770, 27 years before succeeding George Washington to become second president of the United States, young John Adams stepped forward as an attorney to represent reviled British soldiers, who were charged with killing and wounding colonists during the infamous Boston Massacre, whose anniversary is this week. Himself a harsh critic of British occupation, Adams represented the soldiers on principle, to assure a fair trial for highly despised defendants.It's hard to imagine that even the fury of colonial Bostonians, who would shortly launch the American Revolution, exceeded the vehemence felt today toward the perpetrators of the Marathon bombing in April 2013. At the finish line in Copley Square, across from the Boston Public Library in the heart of downtown, two pressure cookers filled with ball bearings and other projectiles exploded in rapid succession. Three spectators, including an eight-year-old boy, were killed. The boy's younger sister -- who lost her left leg -- was among 264 survivors who were injured and treated at 27 local hospitals. 14 victims required amputation. Tsarnaev, now 21, is accused of planting one of the bombs and of participating in the murder of an MIT police officer three nights after the bombings, when the defendant and his brother Tamerlan (now dead) were allegedly planning to flee Boston. In the ensuing police chase, the suspects detonated Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) shattering the late-night silence of the Boston suburb of Watertown -- blasts I heard from my home several blocks away. With armed and dangerous criminals at-large and rampaging through the streets, the entire city of Boston and many surrounding towns were locked down the following day while police searched for the assailants. That night, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found wounded and hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown, where he was taken into custody.These disturbing events are seared deeply into the collective memory of Bostonians. The city now prepares for the trial, which could last until June when we all pray the mountains of snow from this punishing, endless winter will have finally melted into the glory of a New England summer.As the courtroom drama begins this week, important questions of justice and of healing hang in the balance. For an upcoming episode of the Humankind public radio program, I ventured to Harvard Law School to discuss them with Prof. Nancy Gertner, a civil rights lawyer, who served 17 years as a U.S. district judge in Boston. />She recalls that agonizing week of shock, first responders and memorial services. ""The city rose up to shore each other up at every public event, at every opportunity and the stories of people helping one another are legion. So it was remarkable in that respect and what I hope is that legal system lives up to those standards, this extraordinary admirable result.""But she has her doubts. In a city where many of us know someone who ran in the 2013 marathon, where nearly everyone has seen the video footage that apparently depicts Dzhokhar Tsarnaev planting a backpack near the Boylston Street finish line, within a few feet of children, can he get a fair trial? The American system presumes even people accused of the most hideous acts, such as those that played out on the streets in Boston in 2013, to be innocent until proven guilty -- because prosecutors are imperfect human beings, because prejudice clouds judgment, because we are not North Korea or Syria.""The Constitution privileges the defendant's right to a fair trial,"" says Judge Gertner. ""And while the community has an important interest, an important role to play, the victims clearly have an important role to play, I think the victims' interest is in the legitimacy of the process and I think that a process that doesn't appear legitimate and appears skewed doesn't help anyone.""Gertner asks why the trial needs to be in Boston, where nerves are still raw. ""The best model here was the Oklahoma City bombing case, which was tried in Denver... which is the only analogous situation. A building was blown up which was the centerpiece of the community and everyone was affected.""Gertner co-authored a Boston Globe Op-Ed piece in December advocating that Tsarnaev plead guilty in exchange for prosecutors agreeing to recommend a life sentence (rather than the death penalty, which federal prosecutors are seeking). For now, the defense maintains Tsarnaev's innocence and prosecutors have agreed to no plea deal to date.As the trial recreates the crime and its repercussions in devastating detail, one concern is the likelihood that Boston will be traumatized all over again and that deep emotional wounds that victims have worked hard to heal will inevitably be torn back open. A plea deal would spare the city a graphic re-enactment of the tragedy, yet victims would be allowed to testify and confront the defendant in the sentencing phase.So now that a jury has been selected, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- who has spent nearly two years incarcerated under close watch at the Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts -- will have his days in court in the tradition of John Adams. That's what sets us apart from terrorists.Trials are unpredictable events. But perhaps in this one we'll get closer to answering the one question that defies pop psychology and haunts everyone: Why?"

3,ENTERTAINMENT,Neil Patrick Harris Doesn't Know If He Could Host The Oscars Again,Bill Bradley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neil-patrick-harris-oscars_n_6795084.html,,2015-03-04,"HOLLYWOOD, CA - FEBRUARY 22: Host Neil Patrick Harris (R) and actor David Burtka attend the 87th Annual Academy Awards at Hollywood & Highland Center on February 22, 2015 in Hollywood, California.

The problem is Harris doesn't seem sold on the idea of a return engagement.""I don’t know that my family nor my soul could take it,"" he said with a laugh in an interview with The Huffington Post. ""It’s a beast. It was fun to check off the list, but for the amount of time spent and the understandable opinionated response, I don’t know that it's a delightful balance to do every year or even again.""The actor, who recently teamed up with Funny or Die for the 70th anniversary of Thomas the Tank Engine, opened up about the his thoughts on the Oscars, #TheDress and even one big ""How I Met Your Mother"" mystery: Image: TwinfiniteWe saw you tweeted about #TheDress. What do you think about it? I was as fascinated as anyone. I was with my great friends, Josh and Emma, having a much needed sushi meal on the West Coast. And they said, “Have you heard about the dress?"" I had no idea what they were talking about. They showed me the picture, and I didn’t understand it because that was a white and gold dress. I thought that Josh was mocking me by demanding it being blue and black. It made no sense to me. It was clearly white and gold ... And recently, I was looking at it and talking to friends ... and then it was exactly the same picture I had seen the night before, but now all of a sudden I could only see that blue and the black. That's awesome. I still just see white and gold. Do you know what someone said on Twitter in response? That they thought it had a bit to do with how much the photo is cropped because if you’re seeing a lot of the outside white sunlight, that it affects the way you look at it too. Fascinating. It was a nice reprieve from all the Oscar bereavement, so I was thrilled that it exists.Have you been following the Oscars feedback? I didn’t keep up with it obsessively, but it was interesting to see just what people thought landed and didn’t. It’s so difficult for one who’s simply watching the show to realize just how much time and concession and compromise and explanation has gone into almost every single thing. Every joke. Wording of joke. Placement of joke. Canceling of joke. Embellishment for just one line. And I'm not saying that to defend everything I said as if it was the absolute best choice, but it’s also an award show, and you’re powering through 14 acts filled with 20 plus awards. So my job was to try and keep things as light and specific to this year’s set of films as possible. And if people are critical of that, it’s a big giant platform, so I would assume that they would be. What are your thoughts on it? I was glad we got through it, and I thought that those in the audience at the Dolby [Theatre] seemed to be enjoying themselves more as the show went on, when I was told that the opposite would be true. I was told that as the room fills, with you know it's four-fifths of the room didn’t win, and you get further into the award giving they get less enthusiastic and less excited. And I felt while we were doing it that people were enjoying themselves more and more, so for that I’m happy. Image: GiphyOn ""How I Met Your Mother,"" we never found out who's the mother of Barney's kid. Do you know? I do. We actually filmed a scene that they ended up cutting short that involved Barney meeting a girl at MacLaren's [Pub]. And that was the girl that they end up using, and she’s actually one of my closest friends, named Emma, and they ended up not. They ended up wanting to be more ambiguous about who it would be as opposed to putting a face to the character. So I know and the crew knows, but I don’t think it’s a big secret that we’re trying to hide. Crazy. I always thought it was Britney Spears. [Laughs] Well, you could assume she was the answer to a lot of the ""How I Met Your Mother"" questions. Couldn’t you?Do you actually play laser tag in real life? No ... because for the same reason I don’t play paintball. I'm not a fan or running around in a dark maze playing against people who have memorized that maze and know exactly where to hide to destroy you. Do you wear suits all the time like Barney? I do wear a fair amount of suits. They’re not only sartorially suave but quite comfortable and eliminates a lot of decision making. Nice suit, white shirt, matching tie, you’re good to go. Don’t worry about denim shade and sweater color and shirt tucked in or out. Throw on a suit, pop on a watch ... that’s advice.What do you think about Lady Gaga going to ""American Horror Story""? I'm always impressed by Lady Gaga’s talents, and the fact that she branching out beyond what people know her for. It's a bold move, and there's no better show to surprise people with than ""American Horror Story.""Will there ever be a ""Dr. Horrible"" follow up? I would love to. Everyone’s been champing at the bit to do so. They’ve written songs. They have an outline and stuff ... but we’re all working on other things at the moment, so it’s hard to find the time.Image: Giphy"
4,POLITICS,Oklahoma Is One Step Closer To Allowing Nitrogen Gas Executions,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oklahoma-nitrogen-gas-approved_n_6795480.html,,2015-03-04,"'The Oklahoma State Capitol under a deep blue sky.For more Oklahoma City images, see:'",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ec122100002501c96c08.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Oklahoma would become the first state in the nation to allow execution by nitrogen gas under a bill that overwhelmingly passed the state House with no debate Tuesday. Members of the Oklahoma House voted 85-10 in favor of legalizing “nitrogen hypoxia"" -- which causes death by depleting the oxygen supply in the blood -- as a gas chamber alternative to poisonous hydrogen cyanide gas. The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration. ""It's revolutionary,"" Rep. Mike Christian (R-Oklahoma City) who sponsored HB 1879, said of the nitrogen hypoxia method when speaking to The Huffington Post by phone Tuesday. ""If Oklahoma is a state that does executions, we can find a better, humane way to carry them out."" He told HuffPost he got the idea from a 2014 Slate article. Execution by nitrogen gas currently is not a state-sanctioned method anywhere in the world, the piece notes. Dr. Joel Zivot, assistant professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University School of Medicine, previously told HuffPost that it's ethically impossible for a doctor to conduct tests -- and therefore reach conclusions -- on execution procedures.""No physician is an expert in killing, and medicine doesn’t position itself intentionally in taking a life,"" Zivot said. ""There’s no therapeutic use of nitrogen gas, and there’s no way to ethically or practically test if nitrogen gas is a humane alternative.""Christian said he and the bill's supporters are optimistic about the future of nitrogen hypoxia -- especially as the state's current lethal injection protocol faces scrutiny by the U.S. Supreme Court. “I think most of people I’ve talked to across the country think that lethal injection is probably on the way out,"" Christian added. Lethal injection is currently the state's primary execution method, though legal challenges to the constitutionality of the drug have cropped up in the wake of botched executions, like that of inmate Clayton Lockett in 2014. On Jan. 28, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the executions of three Oklahoma death row inmates until it can evaluate the state's lethal injection protocol. The proposed nitrogen gas method would be a backup method should Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol be declared unconstitutional or if the department of corrections is unable to maintain the drug supply. Electrocution is currently Oklahoma's second alternative method -- one Christian said he'd be interested in striking out altogether. ""I don’t see why there’s any need to have the electric chair in the 21st century,"" Christian said. The Oklahoma Senate has a companion bill that has already cleared the judiciary committee.""They have the same language,"" Christian said. ""We'll see which one crosses the finish line first."""

The Associated Press is once again teaming up with technology company Automated Insights to bring its ""robot"" journalism to NCAA college sports, AI announced Wednesday. Starting this spring, the AP will crank out automated sports stories on Division I baseball, and will gradually begin to include Division I women’s basketball, Division II and III men’s basketball and Division II and III football within the next two years. AP and AI joined forces in July to produce quarterly earnings reports for business stories faster and more efficiently. The new focus on college sports will allow the AP to use game statistics provided by the NCAA to produce thousands of college sports stories, bringing coverage to ""every college sports town."" ""Our goal is to be fully live with stories generated automatically when a game is over and onto AP wires and, in this case, NCAA sites,"" AP's Vice President and Managing Editor Lou Ferrara told The Huffington Post in an email. Ferrara said the decision to bring robot journalism to its sports coverage comes from the high quantity of data involved in sports reports, as well as the general lack of certain types of sports coverage available online.""At AP, we have been looking at automation with anything involving data, as we did with corporate earnings reports,"" he said. ""Sports have been in our DNA for a long time and automation for certain sports seems like a logical move, particularly for sports not receiving much widespread coverage yet in demand in certain markets.""AP has used automated technology to report sports stats before. Most of the company's sports agate uses automation, and has for several years. Ferrara told HuffPost that AP has worked a bit with AI on football rankings online, but this is the first time, however, that full-text game stories would be produced.Furthermore, AI's James Kotecki told HuffPost that the company looks forward to growing their relationship with AP, adding that their tools are also used in areas outside of journalism including finance, personal fitness and marketing analytics. The Associated Press also recently hired an automation editor as it explores new ways to use the technology. That's because it's paying off. After partnering with AI to write breaking business stories and earnings reports last summer, AP has been able to go from writing 300 reports to 3,000 reports each quarter, and many of those without any human intervention at all.Of course, critics continue to question whether or not the use of such technology will one day replace real-life journalists. In the past, both AP and Automated Insights have assured readers that no jobs have been lost or threatened due to the introduction of automated articles. Still, AI said in January that the stories written by robots ""contain far fewer errors"" than those that had been written by humans. Ferrara echoed this idea to HuffPost, adding that the only potential for error comes from humans. ""We are always concerned about accuracy,"" Ferrara said. ""But for automation the only error potential, in general, is the result of data being entered incorrectly upstream in the process. And that would be by a human."""

Part of Program 4, it shares a double-bill with Jerome Robbins' 1969 classic, Dances at a Gathering and runs through March 8. Luke is teamed with Principal Dancer Yuan Yuan Tan in a formidable pas de deux set on the second movement of The Tirol Concerto for Piano and Orchestra by Philip Glass. As the title suggests, the composer's signature patterns and driving rhythms mean to illuminate deep roots and far-away points. Scarlett's choreography moves the couple between certainty and the ambiguous, from faith to misgiving and then dissolves into an icy split. Around seventeen minutes in length, the sequence offers the most arresting view of Australian-born Luke Ingham and his easy compatibility with contemporary abstractions. Luke appeared as the Nutcracker Prince in this season's opening night performance of the Tchaikovsky favorite. Yuan Yuan Tan joined him in the brilliant Grand Pas de Deux of Act II. The duo proved dynamic. ""I'm at the stage where I still really enjoy doing Nutcracker,"" he said. LUKE INGHAM. Photo, Chris HardyIt's my third Nutcracker here, but it's still very new. The first year, I did King of the Snow. Last year, I did both Snow and the Grand Pas. I had some things in mind that I really wanted to work on and that I was aiming to show. In my variation, for example -- just that little bit of dancing on my own. I mean, I wasn't going to be just standing behind YY. She's a great partner. But I wanted to show that I can do stuff on my own as well.Mission accomplished. Case in point -- during his variation, the fiery energy of his circling leaps around the stage (the Jetés en manège) drew a huge response from the viewers. In the Company's ultimately glamorous Opening Night Gala on January 22 (its theme, ""Infinite Romance""), Luke was shown to his complete advantage with Sofiane Sylve in a pas de deux from Christopher Wheeldon's There Where She Loved, and later with Mathilde Froustey, Carlo Di Lanno and Sarah Van Patten in the U.S. premiere of Souvenir d'un lieu cher choreographed by Alexei Ratmansky. In Program 2: Giselle -- Luke was paired with Sarah Van Patten. We talked about the challenging dramatic aspects in his role as the appealing but unfaithful Prince Albrecht. ""When did you get it that you have all the equipment of a romantic lead?"", I asked. He laughed.I don't know if I've gotten that yet! I think with ballet it can be very difficult. There are a lot of physical attributes that go along with dance -- and there are so many different parts for people with different qualities. That is what I find really appealing. I think these different qualities have always been in me.  Yuan Yuan Tan and Luke Ingham in Liam Scarlett's Hummingbird. Photo, Erik TomassonLuke has been in dance class since he was five. It all started where he was born -- Mount Gambier, a town of about 28,000 people in South Australia. Luke pointed out that Sir Robert Helpmann was from there. Remembered for his performance as Ivan Boleslawsky in the 1948 film classic, The Red Shoes, Helpmann went on to become the favorite partner of Dame Margot Fonteyn and director of The Australian Ballet. Luke eventually joined the company and stayed for eight years.My mom was a dancer when she was young. She went to a ballet school and also did tap. She never did it professionally, it was more of a hobby. Like me, going surfing on the weekends. It was sort of the same thing for her. She never pushed me into it. When I was about three, I found a pair of shoes and a leotard she had. I wanted to know what it was. She said that when I turned five I could go to class. I think she was hoping I would kind-of forget about it -- you know, being in a country town. When I turned five, she said I asked about it again and then took me along. She and the teacher grew up dancing together. I didn't see my first ballet until we moved to Adelaide, the capitol city. It's about four hours away from where we lived. I was eleven. I was a very hyperactive kid. I played cricket at lunch time and football-Australian football. But I never stopped going to class. Once we moved to Adelaide, I was introduced to this other teacher who really pushed me a lot. Around thirteen, I was swimming. Every night I had something going -- sports or swimming or ballet. On the weekend, I did this thing called Surf Lifesaving. I would come home and fall asleep on the couch. Eventually my mom said, 'You can't keep doing all this, it's too hard.'Prior to coming to San Francisco Ballet, Luke's dramatic roles included Lescaut in Kenneth MacMillan's Manon which is set to music from the opera score by Jules Massenet; Franz in the Coppélia choreographed by Peggy van Praagh; and Jerome Robbins' 1953 hit, Afternoon of a Faun.When I first joined the Company, I knew they were doing Onegin the following season and I really want to do the role. When I got the opportunity, I was so excited. Jane Bourne was here to put the ballet on, so I spent a lot of time with her. She has so much insight into the characters, plus everyone I worked with had done it the previous year. Onegin has made a choice. He has experienced so much of the world and has lost touch with the people that were around him. He thinks he is better than everyone else and laments being there. I think the ballet says a lot about Cranko as well. The third act pas de deux [Onegin and Tatyana] is amazing and so technically challenging. You can see how tortured he is about all the mistakes he made. The choreography is all laid-out for you. With Albrecht, it's kind-of the opposite. He wants to have an experience outside of the palace, something different. It's all new and exciting and he's not thinking of the consequences.The second act of Giselle offers the wayward Albrecht a wide variety of dance opportunities and dramatic expression. The dictates of tradition have him approach Giselle's gravesite wearing an extra-long cape while carrying a bouquet of white lilies. He is filled with anguish and grief such as he has never known. His movements are slow, deliberate and highly stylized. The overall tone and look -- easily described as ""histrionic"" -- is the stuff of purist poetry to great Russian dancers such as Rudolf Nureyev, Mikhail Baryshnikov and San Francisco's own Yuri Possokhov. This is Luke's second season of dancing Albrecht with SF Ballet. I asked him what he noticed in coming back to the role.I feel more secure with everything -- with the mime, the partnering, the acting, the story. I'm able to relax a lot more. That's when I get the most out of it. I really want to try to create a mood, especially in that first scene. I used certain events I've had in my life to focus-in on how I felt in those moments. I try to bring that to the character -- for instance, when Giselle dies -- to put myself back in that moment I'm drawing from. Maybe that's not a conventional way, but it's what feels comfortable. I have to feel really comfortable before I'm able to express that. I still find it very difficult to do in the studio.Luke actually performed in San Francisco in 2010. He was traveling as a guest artist with Morphoses/The Wheeldon Company and one of the stops was the Yerba Buena Centre. Helgi Tomasson saw the performance. Luke came back in 2012 for an audition. Sofiane Sylve and Luke Ingham in Wheeldon's There Where She Loved. Photo, Erik TomassonI had met one of the Ballet Masters here a couple of times and so I e-mailed him and said I was coming to San Francisco and wanted to audition. I did a couple of classes and Helgi offered me a Soloist contract. I was really happy about that. I started here in July 2013, my first show was in London. I can't remember all the pieces, but I performed in Christopher Wheeldon's Within the Golden Hour. I went on with Sarah Van Patten. She had been dancing with Pierre Vilanoba, but he hurt his foot in the first ballet. It was lucky I was actually in the theatre because I wasn't supposed to be on. It was one of those situations where I had thought -- 'Oh, I can just go out and enjoy London, it will be fine. Or go to the theatre like I'm supposed to.' The guilt got the better of me and I went. I ended up going on without any rehearsal. Chris was there and was a bit worried. But the show went really well.I was really happy to get the opportunity for that to be my first show. Within the Golden Hour is definitely very unique. Since then, it's been pretty much the same. I've been thrown into a lot and have just really embraced all the opportunities I've been given. You have to look at the positive side. And make the most of it!"

Collins speaks about the BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative, Tuesday, April 2, 2013, in the East Room at the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ec142400003200577917.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Young scientists entering biomedical research find themselves in the worst financial environment in a half a century, the head of the National Institutes of Health said Tuesday. In an appearance before the House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations, Dr. Francis Collins offered a familiar warning to lawmakers considering future appropriations for scientific research. Investments are falling relative to inflation, he said, forcing changes likely to snowball into the future. “Given international trends,” Collins said, citing a recent article in the medical journal JAMA, “the United States will relinquish its historical international lead in biomedical research in the next decade unless certain measures are undertaken.” Collins warned that these trends would convince a future generation of researchers that their field was inhospitable. Fewer young scientists would mean fewer scientific discoveries, making it more difficult for companies to profit and for public health authorities to guard against diseases. “This is the issue that wakes me up at night when I try to contemplate the future of where biomedical research can go in the United States,” Collins said. “They are finding themselves in a situation that is the least supportive of that vision in 50 years. They look ahead of them and see the more senior scientists struggling to keep their labs going and suffering rejection after rejection of grants that previously would have been supportive. And they wonder, 'Do we really want to sign up for that?' And many of them, regrettably, are making the decision to walk away.”Sobering budgetary assessments are nothing new from Collins, who heads the federal government's main funder of biomedical research. He has been preaching the need for stable NIH budgeting for years, and has amplified those warnings since the spending cuts brought about by sequestration went into effect in 2013. NIH has lost about 22 percent of its purchasing power since 2003. In fiscal 2014, it was appropriated $30.1 billion. A two-year bipartisan budget agreement brought a temporary reprieve. But that agreement runs out in September. Collins’ appearance in the House on Tuesday is likely the first prong in a months-long campaign arguing that the days of sequestration shouldn't return. The budget situation for NIH, like every other federal agency, is uncertain come September. Under current law, non-defense discretionary spending would be $493 billion in fiscal 2016, up just $1 billion from fiscal 2015., according to a document put together by House Democrats. Without a change, appropriators will have little discretion to provide more funding. If they did increase the NIH budget, it would come at the harm of other domestic programs. A recent report by the group United for Medical Research made clear the high stakes of stagnant scientific research funding. Compared with countries that have “made long-term commitments to increase their support of biomedical sciences,” the report said, federal funding cuts are leading to “an erosion of America’s preeminence in biomedicine.” “China is filing more patents in biomedicine than the U.S. -- not just as a portion of GDP, but absolutely more patents,"" Collins said. ""And the consequences, I think you can imagine, are going to be significant.” Members of Congress from both parties have tried innovations to funnel funds to NIH. Proposals have included creating an incentive fund to encourage appropriators to make steady financial commitments; a biomedical research private-public bank; to remove the NIH from the discretionary budget; to generate money by penalizing big pharmaceutical companies that break the law; and to certify that the sequester no longer applies to NIH. None of these have gained significant traction in the new Congress, where some conservative members have criticized NIH for funding quixotic-sounding projects at the expense of critical short-term needs. Collins wasn’t asked about this critique (though in the past, he has argued that science funding decisions are best made through peer review and that even funny-sounding ideas may bear great fruit). He also didn’t address any new funding proposals during his two-hour appearance on Tuesday morning. Instead, he offered a broad pitch for lawmakers to fund NIH in a way that “that keeps up with inflation, plus a little bit.”The reception he received underscores the difficulty and frustration of his objective.Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) called the hearing “the most popular panel we will see all session long.” Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) called for a “group hug” among attendees. Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) said the discussion was “so very exciting” and happily offered enthusiasm for doubling NIH funding, which happened during the Clinton and Bush administrations. And Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) noted that, “the bipartisan nature of this subject with this committee is pretty obvious.” Then Simpson delivered a bitter pill. Everyone on the committee would like to “substantially increase the research we’re doing,” he said, “if we didn’t have an $18 trillion debt and $500 billion deficit that we are having to deal with at the same time, which makes it more difficult.”"

I do not want children ever.",2015-03-03,A woman with a floppy hat and native shall overlooking a lake.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb600d92400003000981a45.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am about to tell you something that may shock you. Are you ready? Are you sitting down? Okay.I do not want children.Now let me be clear, it's not that I don't want children right now. It's not that I don't want children until after I'm married, or after I've paid off my student loan debt, or after I've bought a house. There is no caveat to this statement.I do not want children ever.If I'm being totally honest, that's largely because I don't like children. I'm not good with them. I have spent my whole life as an only child and have utterly loved every minute of being sibling-less. I could be the poster girl for only child syndrome: spoiled, achievement-oriented, impatient, etc. And as such, I don't really have a ton of experience with children. I've never even held a baby (and no, I don't want to hold yours, thanks for asking). And so, I'm extremely awkward around them. I have no idea how to interact with a child younger than 12. Children are a mystery to me.My only child-ness has also made me equal parts introverted and selfish. This is, admittedly, not a great combination if you have to sacrifice your own needs and want to constantly care for another, smaller human being who can't fend for itself yet. And I have no desire to change these things about myself. It's who I am, and I like who I am. I like the life I have and the childless life I envision for myself in the future.Now, none of this is meant to be a knock against folks who do want children. If that's what you want to do, then you should do it. Parenthood is a phenomenal thing that makes so many feel fulfilled and happy. And that's great, but it's not for everyone.We live in a society -- in a world, really -- where it is assumed that the default desire of women is to have children. Producing offspring is supposedly so hardwired into not only who a woman is, but also who she is supposed to be, so that if she doesn't want to have kids, there must be something wrong with her. She has deviated from the societal norm regarding what is expected of her, and therefore she's defective. She's less than other women who do wish to take advantage of their reproductive systems. Or she is, simply, wrong about what she wants. She clearly does not know her own mind, and if given enough time (and, perhaps, enough patronizing lectures about how a ""real"" woman is naturally supposed to want children) she will change it. And if you think I am being hyperbolic about any of this, you have clearly never been a woman who has expressed a desire to remain child-free out loud. Believe me, I have encountered all of this rhetoric at one time or another.There are, rather obviously, a number of things wrong with these stereotypical notions of who women should be and what they should want (thanks, patriarchy). I am convinced that there are few things more frustrating in this world than expressing how you feel, and then being told you are, actually, incorrect. The response I've been given the most often when I tell someone I don't want kids is immediately ""Oh, you're young. You'll change your mind."" Full disclosure: I'm 22. And yes, I'm still young, but that doesn't automatically mean I'm incapable of coming to a mature, well-reasoned conclusion about who I am and what I want for my life, you know what I'm saying? The casual dismissal of something you know to be absolutely true about yourself is infuriating at best, and dehumanizing at worst. Let us also acknowledge not only the vast amount of sexism contained within these ideas, but also the cissexism embedded in them as well. Not all women can have children, and not all people who can have children are women. Gender stereotypes like these end up being all the more harmful because they refuse to operate outside of a binary that winds up being exclusionary to the many folks who don't neatly fit into it.Throughout my teenage years and now into my early twenties, as I became more and more certain about wanting to remain childless, I unwittingly internalized a lot of these ideas about who I was supposed to be as a woman, and what I was supposed to be wanting and feeling. There's all this talk about maternal instincts women of childbearing age feel and how they begin yearning to start a family. I wasn't feeling anything of the sort. I recoiled inside at the thought of having a child instead of being filled with this warm, wistful glow. I didn't understand. What was wrong with me?Then, about a year ago, I slowly began to come around to a surprising revelation:There is absolutely nothing wrong with me.I do not want to have children, and that's okay. As it turns out, not wanting kids will absolutely not make me ""less"" of a woman. I am not defective. I am not wrong. I know my own mind. I have intrinsic value as a singular, autonomous person, and that value is not contingent upon me using my body to produce another person. Wanting to be child-free does not make me any better or worse of a human being than any other person who does choose to have children. It's just a choice I've made about my own life. It's no less valid a choice than the choice to become a mother. And that, to me, gets at the real heart of feminism: being granted the freedom to make choices for myself without judgment.Now, if you happen to know any good cats that need homes, call me. I'm positively nuts about cats.This post originally appeared on Femsplain.com.--Jessica Burnell works for a think tank in Washington, D.C.

11,POLITICS,ICYMI: Here's Everything That Happened During The Netanyahu News Dump,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/netanyahu-boehner_n_6793464.html,,2015-03-03,"National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden appears on a live video feed broadcast from Moscow at an event sponsored by the ACLU Hawaii in Honolulu on Saturday, Feb. 14, 2015. (AP Photo/Marco Garcia)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ec073c000018010dff9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday morning, an event that was -- for many Beltway swells -- the hot ticket for the social event of the season. But all the media attention focused on Netanyahu's remarks has made for the perfect opportunity to do a rare Tuesday Morning News Roundup. Here's what everyone missed.1. House Republicans cave on DHS funding.So ends that winsome melodrama. Days after Congress extended the final act of the ""Will They Defund the Department of Homeland Security"" saga by one week, House Speaker John Boehner is calling for an anti-climax. As Elise Foley reports:Senate Democrats have already shown that they will not vote for a funding bill that passed the House in January. That bill would tie funding to ending President Barack Obama's immigration actions, which could allow as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants to temporarily stay in the country and work.The center of this contretemps is a series of executive actions from Obama, implementing his policy preferences on immigration. At the moment, 26 states are suing the administration over those executive actions, a fact that Boehner cited in telling House Republicans there'd be a vote on a ""clean"" DHS funding bill. ""The good news is that the president’s executive action has been stopped, for now,"" the speaker said. ""This matter will continue to be litigated in the courts, where we have our best chance of winning this fight.""Shutting down Homeland Security is an option that Boehner on Tuesday deemed to be ""untenable."" Given his approval of the lawsuit lodged against the White House, it makes you wonder how a threatened shutdown made it even this far.2. David Petraeus gets slapped on the wrist in a plea deal.""The alternative to this bad deal is a much better deal,"" said Netanyahu of the current negotiations over Iran's nuclear future, on which the Israeli prime minister would like to put the kibosh. As if to emphasize the secret existence of really great deals you had no right to expect, the U.S. Department of Justice reached an accord with wayward military guru and retired general David Petraeus, who scandalized himself after it came to light that he'd shared classified information with his inamorata and biographer, Paula Broadwell.The New York Times' Michael S. Schmidt and Matt Apuzzo have the story:Mr. Petraeus will plead guilty to one count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison. Mr. Petraeus has signed the agreement, said Marc Raimondi, a Justice Department spokesman.What's the over/under on ""number of days Petraeus will spend in jail""? I'd advise you to go low -- this is, after all, an American Thought Leader. I'd sort of like to see some people at least apologize to MoveOn over this thing, as it seems only fair at this point. Speaking of:3. Edward Snowden may be returning to the United States.Russia -- don't know if you've heard -- is a really hectic place right now, and apparently Edward Snowden wants out. According to Reuters' Gennady Novik and Gabriela Baczynska, a Russian lawyer told reporters there is some sort of ongoing trilateral legal wrangling that could ultimately return Snowden to America:Anatoly Kucherena, who has links to the Kremlin, was speaking at a news conference to present a book he has written about his client. Moscow granted Snowden asylum in 2013, straining already tense ties with Washington.There are, of course, opportunities for content synergy.4. Russ Feingold will do some stuff.Former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) is heading for the door at the State Department, where he's been serving as the special envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rumors are plentiful that his aim is to return to the Senate by defeating the man who defeated him (in a thoroughly ironic result), Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). That is no easy task. As Roll Call's Nathan Gonzales points out, ousting the senator who ousted you is a political trick that ""hasn't happened in nearly a century.""Feingold took to Facebook on Tuesday to offer the precise sort of vague intimations that make political reporters freak themselves:After I leave the State Department this week, I will spend portions of 2015 teaching international relations and law at Stanford University. For most of the rest of this year, I will be living at my home in Middleton, Wisconsin, from where I will travel the state extensively. I will listen carefully to my fellow Wisconsinites talk about their concerns, especially those involving their economic well-being. I will also seek their counsel on how I can best further serve my country and the state I love.Here's hoping he stuck to his government email account while at State.Anyway, that's what you missed this morning if you were caught up in ""Netanyahu speech"" Twitter.Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?"

If Uruguay as a country is part exile, part refuge, Mujica made the country more the latter. One thing is certain, the world will remember Mujica -- the president, the person.",2015-03-03,"Uruguayan President Jose Mujica waves after participating in a conference on the last day of the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, Mexico, on December 7, 2014. Argentina is this year's Guest of Honour Country at the Guadalajara Fair, the largest in the Spanish-language world. AFP PHOTO/Hector Guerrero (Photo credit should read HECTOR GUERRERO/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baea49d2200005700db02a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Uruguayan president that stepped down on Sunday could sound strident and empathetic at the same time, appear both hopeful and defeated, uttering one sentence, and offer a strange confluence of political beliefs while addressing a single issue. In short, the world famous Jose ""Pepe"" Mujica was a person. He represented all the paradoxes and contradictions inherent in that state of being. Mujica became the distinction for all that he was, and, almost in equal measure, all that he wasn't.True, Mujica's remarkable personal narrative -- he endured 10 years in solitary confinement during Uruguay's dirty war -- singles him out. But he is not riding on victim clout. Mujica distinguished himself, not only through his fantastic story, but also by saying what he thought. We all know officialese when we hear it. And people the world over have something in common: When their head of state speaks, he or she adopts that certain presidential affectation. In the United States, in particular, the president's words are vetted, edited and packaged until becoming a consumer product. Our presidents seem almost ready for trademark.Mujica's forthright style came to have broad significance. It led to action. Those actions earned the attention of people all over the globe. That a head of state from little Uruguay garnered so much attention is remarkable, particularly in an age where GDP and strategic positioning are so paramount.Mujica changed Uruguay. He embodied the principles and essence of the country, but he also willed it to change through sheer force of personality and good will. He welcomed the Guantanamo detainees that the United States had cleared for release, but no one else wanted. He legalized same-sex marriage. He created a legal marketplace for marijuana, while at the same time denouncing the health effects of the drug. Most importantly, he made all those major reforms, despite the fact that a majority of Uruguayans opposed every single one of those initiatives. Nevertheless, he managed to maintain the support of the Uruguayan electorate.Mujica wasn't perfect, but he was reliably honest and original. Most importantly, the Uruguayan president was earnestly optimistic amid a disastrous global context. After having intervened with such human and financial expense in the Middle East, the United States is witnessing a horrifying conflagration in the region -- of the likes not seen in perhaps a millennia. The horrors are worse than unrelenting -- they are escalating. The situation in North Korea, which some years ago seemed destined for improvement with the ascension of a young leader, is now a dangerous crapshoot. Uruguay's large neighbor to the south, Argentina, is on the verge of country-wide nervous breakdown, given the near-fictional political turmoil and corruption. Indeed, there seems to be no good news anywhere.And then there was Mujica -- who in his latest, pudgy, scrunched-up-eye incarnation seems the opposite extreme of the wildly alert and Hollywood-handsome guerrillero of his youth. Mujica seemed to project a luminous spot on a shadowed globe. He became known, not only as the poorest president for living in a ramshackle cottage and getting around on an old VW bug, but also as the president people around the world would like to have for themselves. Regardless of where people live, a great multitude want a different kind of leadership. The kind of president that just talks.Mujica didn't disappoint in his last days in office. Shortly before stepping down, he expressed the awe-inspiring depth and range of his individuality when addressing the complaints that one of the former Guantanamo detainees had about his situation in Uruguay:""If these people were humble people of the desert, poor people, they'd surely be stronger and more primitive, but they're not,"" Mujica said, adding: ""Through their hands, features and family histories, it seems to me that they're middle class.""There is no doubt that Mujica is the first head of state to hurl the lexicon of class warfare against a former Gitmo inmate. Perhaps he is the first person to ever do so. And if that wasn't enough to blur conventional political lines and boundaries, Mujica tapped into conservative meritocratic principles for the dressing down -- basically telling the former detainees to get out there and get their hands dirty with honest work. When Mujica gets downright testy, he can deliver a unique ideological rebuke. And while the Uruguayan leader later expressed greater sympathy for the Guantanamo refugees, people in pain and paralysis sometimes benefit from a no-nonsense drubbing -- particularly from a head of state who was, himself, imprisoned without trial.Mujica projected, from his presidential perch, the wildly innocent virtue of Uruguay itself -- and magnified it. If Uruguay as a country is part exile, part refuge, Mujica made the country more the latter. One thing is certain, the world will remember Mujica -- the president, the person.Postscript for the Reader: As a first-generation American of Uruguayan descent, Mujica evokes in this writer powerful feelings of childhood nostalgia. In short, Mujica reminds me of an Uruguayan uncle. Not any particular uncle per se, he just looks and feels like family. This portrayal should be interpreted and registered with such partiality in mind. Reader beware. "

But my father didn't believe in God, though he worshipped the sea. Today, etchings by Gauguin who at 34 lost his job when the French Stock Exchange crashed and beyond his fear, his gift for painting was waiting. No one wants to accept this. But when the first dream comes down, the real dream begins. With no formal training, Gauguin was compelled to cross the sea till he found himself in Tahiti carving mysterious statues from old tree trunks. I'm now before a woodblock of a woman listening to a voice in the sky. She's made of lime wood. The chisel marks smell like the shavings in our basement when I'd watch my father stroke the nicked up surface of mahogany to reveal its woody center. This is where we meet: craftsman, artist, poet. I imagine the three of us in some café: Gauguin impatient with us, my father wondering why I brought us together, and me feeling awkward but content, to know the place we all come from.A Question to Walk With: Tell the story of a time when one dream came apart which in time revealed another.

Notice that the image now has artifacts that look (to me anyway) like damage in an old photograph. This is a sample size of one, so I'm curious to know if this inversion changes the perceptions of any other black-and-bluers out there.We know that training can alter the ""light-from-above"" prior, and it seems plausible that people's differing perceptions of the photo are due to their different experience, and in particular their experience with light, shading, material, and overexposed photographs. Our brains have to make guesses, but they don't always make the same guesses, even though we live in the same world. One of the hardest inference problems our brains have to solve is figuring out how everyone else sees the world. Perhaps with some very hard work, I can be a Black-and-bluer, too.--Michael Buice is a scientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science.

The issue centers around ""no-go zones."" In January, a pundit on Fox News claimed that there were neighborhoods in France and the United Kingdom that had been taken over by Muslims and were off-limits to others. The claim, however, was false, and the network apologized. But last month, Tennessee state Rep. Susan Lynn (R) and state Sen. Bill Ketron (R) introduced legislation in the House and Senate aimed at ridding the state of no-go zones, or, as the bills describe them, ""contiguous geographical area[s] consisting of public space or privately owned public space where community organizing efforts systematically intimidate or exclude the general public or public workers from entering or being present within the area."" The Council on American-Islamic Relations said that even though Muslims are not specifically singled out in the legislation, it appears to be motivated by Islamophobia. ""The whole fantastical notion of a no-go zone, which has been disproven by even Fox News, is almost gospel on the right wing of the political spectrum now,"" CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper told The Huffington Post after likening the zones to unicorns. ""It's just utter nonsense but, [as] with so much in the Islamophobia industry in the United States ... it passes for statesmanship in the current climate.""Robert McCaw, CAIR's government affairs manager, recently wrote a letter to leading lawmakers in the Tennessee General Assembly requesting that they abandon the legislation. The bill does not explicitly target or single out any particular group that may be at risk for creating ""no-go zones."" But according to Lynn, some constituents have expressed feelings of discomfort when in areas they consider sketchy.""And as you know, when there's activity happening where people sort of feel intimidated, there's not exactly a sign up on the wall,"" Lynn told The Tennessean. ""But it's just an overall feeling of intimidation.""Lynn also likened her bill to civil rights era legislation that integrated schools. Hooper said the comparison is absurd. ""It's all just a smoke screen for anti-Muslim bigotry,"" he said. ""It's all part of the Islamophobia machine's campaign to demonize Islam and marginalize American Muslims. And anything that contributes to that marginalization is okay with them -- no matter how fantastical it is."" Hedy Weinberg, executive director of Tennessee's American Civil Liberties Union, told The Huffington Post the bill is an attempt to subject the state's Muslim population to unwarranted discrimination. ""Existing laws already ensure that public safety and access to public space are protected, without threatening Tennesseans' rights to peaceable assembly and religious freedom,"" she said. ""To put it simply, there are no places in Tennessee that are exempt from existing state and federal laws."" The Knoxville News Sentinel also slammed the bill in an editorial Monday, writing, ""The bill is obviously aimed at Muslims, though they are not mentioned by name in the bill. Bigotry, however it is disguised, remains bigotry.""Ketron, the bill's Senate sponsor, has a history of supporting anti-Muslim legislation. According to CAIR, Ketron raised concerns in 2013 that a sink in the state Capitol was being used by Muslims to perform ablutions before daily prayer. The previous year, the senator co-sponsored the Putting Tennessee First Act, which would have limited the number of immigrants working in the state's charter schools, after a conservative group claimed Islamic influence was rising in the state. Ketron also introduced a bill in 2011 that would have outlawed adherence to Sharia within Tennessee's borders. Most of these proposals addressed issues that didn't exist in the first place, according to Hooper -- but they still had negative effects.""The impact that they do have is a public relations propaganda impact in terms of getting people to feel hostility toward Islam and Muslims,"" he said. Weinberg said the state's general assembly should put its focus elsewhere. ""The legislature should focus on issues that require real attention like access to health care, economic development and education rather than creating non-existent problems,"" she said. Lynn and Ketron did not immediately return requests for comment. "

As a palette, paint, and brush artist, his hands have never stopped working. His figurative art draws out the form and essence of his subjects, provoking a higher sense of sensuality, flexibility and grandeur. Reality is transformed through his imagination: sometimes into kindness, other times into scathing violence. The sculptures, paintings and drawings have created a relevant artistic production, whose objective is ""to create a formal opulence."" These powerful figures, whether in marble or bronze, have been on exhibition in the most important venues in the world, such as: The Champs Elysees in Paris, Park Avenue in New York, The Grand Canal in Venice, and The Paseo de Recoletos in Madrid.The still-lifes, the bull fighting, the circus, the religion and the eroticism make up an extensive theme rooted in Latin America -- specifically in his native country -- with a manifest skill in drawing and color. The beautiful and the violent combine together in the Boterian imagery that brings us closer to Colombia'ssoul through a nostalgic reminiscence. Through his studies in Montecarlo, with views of the Mediterranean sea and his characteristic lighting, we can draw closer to the soul of this magnificent artist.Elena Cué: His knowledge about art history is plentiful and has unquestionably influenced his art work. Do you believe that an artist can be complete without being influenced by culture?Fernando Botero: A great artist is born from a profound knowledge of the tradition and problems of painting. However, there are many works in which freshness and audacity surprise, as can be seen in popular art and in certain examples of modern art.E.C: You have said that ""art is a permanent accusation."" Do you believe an artist has a moral duty to use his work to point out and denounce injustices in this devastating world?   F.B: The only duty an artist has is in the quality of the art. There is no moral obligation to denounce. An artist confronted with a tremendous injustice sometimes feels inclined to say something. Denouncing the situation is the artist's choice.E.C: Goya's influence in your paintings is evident. The series of engravings, ""Casualties of War"" (""Los desastres de la guerra"") totally reveals a dramatic cruelty and barbaric humanity. Your work includes a series about the crimes that occurred in the Iraqi jail of Abu Ghraib after the United States attacks in 2001. In this world of cyber-technology, events are ephemeral, since the new always replaces the old, in contrast to art which is powerful and timeless, making it more applicable. Why did you choose this precise series of crimes?  F.B: I did not choose this series of crimes, it was impossible to ignore them: just like Iraqi prisoners being tortured by Americans, in the Abu Ghraib jail - the same place where Sadam Hussein was tortured. Or, the violence in Colombia which left thousands of victims, on both sides, and displaced people, and since this happened in my country, it was especially painful for me.E.C: Goya already stated that illustration didn't make barbarism disappear. Do you believe there is hope in this respect?F.B: It is not possible for art to resolve situations which are basically political. The artist shows the situation that exists like a ""permanent denunciation."" Nobody would recall the small village, Guernica, which was bombed, if it were not for Picasso. E.C: Wisdom comes from a long life. What do you believe is the meaning of life?F.B: The meaning of life is different for everyone. Some take on a hedonist attitude. For others, there is a necessity for spiritual or cultural fulfillment based on discipline. E.C: You have already embraced the life of an artist in every possible way, in all of its complexities. What counsel would you give the younger generations of artists?  F.B: An artist is born like a priest is born. If they are born an artist, I would tell them art is not a game, it is something very serious which completely requires everything you have to give.E.C: With an aesthetic technique as identifiable as yours, in which reality is expressed through a volumetric sensuality, what opinion do you have of the English artist, Beryl Cook, whose work reflects a seemingly jovial nature with an aesthetic sense very similar to yours?  F.B: This is the first time I have heard of Beryl Cook.E.C: Your artistic production has beentypecast as ""Magic Realism"" determined by the importance of the myths in Latin-America, as well as the ""New Figurative""artcharacterized by a return to the informal methods of figurative painting. Do you agree with this description?  F.B: Magic Realism, definitely not, because in my works nothing is magic. I paint about things which are unlikely but not impossible. In my pieces, nobody flies and nothing impossible happens.Art is always an exaggeration in some sense; in color, in form, even in theme, etc... but it has always been this way. It is the same with the nature of some works by Giotto or Massacio, or the color of life as expressed by Van Gogh.It could be a new figurative work. It is probable because we have inherited the liberty from abstract art, and we have a liberty in terms of shapes. Color and space involves thinking, not realism. E.C: What literature works have influenced and helped in the type of works you paint?F.B: I do not believe that other arts can influence painting - sometimes a vulgar image or a piece of popular art have more affect in the sensitivity of the painter than a masterpiece of literature. Since the very beginning I intuitively had an interest in exaggerating sizes. E.C: What importance does sketching have in your painting?F.B: It is of utmost importance. Sketching is almost everything. It is the painter's identity, his style, his conviction, and then color is just a gift to the drawing.E.C: The generous donation of more than 200 works from your own collection to the Botero Museum in Bogotá, and almost 20 others to the Antioquía Museum in Medellín is exemplary.   What have your motivation and satisfaction been in this respect? F.B: The donation I made to Columbia from my collection, and from many of my works, is one of the best ideas I ever had in my life. The public's enjoyment is the best reward.E.C: The millennial Hindu book, Kama Sutra, about the art of love in its spiritual and sexual fullness is reinvented by your imagination in Boterosutra. Which artists, from your point of view, have the best ability to represent love?  F.B: Eroticism has made great plastic manifestation all over the Orient, in Persia, Japan, India, etc. I did my Boterosutra series using more imagination than memory, trying as always to make the artistic expression more important than the theme - the rhythm of drawing, the subtle modeling, the application of color were the dominant elements in this series. The theme is extraordinary and unique because only in loving the human body can you make postures which could only be repeated in the circus.E.C: Nietzsche, in The Birth of a Tragedy, writes ""it is only as an aesthetic phenomenon that existence and the world are eternally justified."" Is the art, as stated by Nietzsche, the metaphysical activity of life? For an artist like you, would this metaphysics be the only way we can make our avatars existence tolerable?  F.B: I have never read Nietzsche, but I do believe that the artist presents a world as the metaphysics of art. The artist presents, through his work in general, a more beautiful loving world that makes the ""avatars of our existence,"" as you said, more tolerable.E.C: The study of the relationship of an artist's biography and work has been a constant throughout the history of art. The Colombian history, social and political reality are expressed through your career. How do you see your country evolving right now? What vision do you have for spreading your national cultural identity?  F.B: The work of an artist, in its totality, is like a self portrait - in my country, in between great dramas, there has been an economic evolution and culturally positive advancements. I believe in the importance of the roots in an artist's work. That 'something' that comes from the motherland is what gives works their touch of honesty.E.C: What have been the most important moments of your life?F.B: The most important moments of my life have always been connected to my work. They were moments in which I felt I accomplished something unexpected.E.C: What do you have left to do?F.B: Learn to paint.Photos: François Fernández"

True story. It's because of King v. Burwell, a case before the Supreme Court involving four tiny little words in the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) that, if the plaintiffs are successful, could cause nearly 10,000 unnecessary deaths each year.How is this possible? Let's go back to 2010 for a moment, shortly after Obamacare passed. A group of conservative lawyers, all having presumably wonderful health insurance, gathered to find a way to stop millions of mostly lower-income people from accessing affordable health care. Sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, partly funded by the Koch brothers, they zeroed in on Section 36B, which covered how the marketplaces would work -- for an amazing reading of Obamacare, check this out. In describing who is eligible for the federal tax subsidies offered to lower-income people who can't afford the high premiums of health insurance, Obamacare refers to the marketplaces as ""established by the State."" Well, cut to 34 states refusing to create marketplaces, resulting in the federal government setting up an exchange for people in those states.The thing is though, Obamacare foresaw states refusing to set up marketplaces, but it didn't foresee the four words ""established by the State"" to be used in a petty lawsuit stating that only people who live in states that set up their own marketplace can get the federal subsidy. If that's true, and the Supreme Court agrees, then the 7.5 million people in those 34 states will lose their subsidy, which is the only way many of them can afford health care in the first place.So where are the 34 states that these 10,000 soon-to-be dead people live in? They are mostly Republican-controlled states, largely in the South. Oh, you probably should know that most of these states have the lowest access to preventive public health measures, meaning that if you're poor, the closest thing you've got to health care is Advil (but generic, because poor).So why don't these people just move to a state that has marketplaces? Uh, have you ever rented a U-Haul? That shit is expensive, even with that free ladder they throw in.Can't Congress just fix this seemingly small problem? Yes, very easily, but the current Congress is more likely to pass a resolution to have three-ply toilet paper in Congressional bathrooms than pass meaningful legislation that could help millions.But you know what else, it doesn't just affect poor people (this is where all the old white people say, ""Wait, did someone say I could lose money?""). If 7.5 million people lose their subsidy, and half of them can't afford their current insurance policies, then premiums go up for everybody!I live in California, a state that fortunately set up a marketplace. My family lives in Missouri, a state without a marketplace. So there's a possibility that my brother, who happens to have cerebral palsy, won't be able to afford his insurance any longer. Which means he can't get the services he needs to like, live. All because of four little words. I mention this to stress how close to home this hits for millions of Americans.Lawsuits like this feed into a pattern that is quickly becoming a cancer on the United States: the relentless attack on the working poor. This lawsuit and most of the rhetoric of those that oppose Obamacare is a blatant disrespect for lower-income Americans. Who are these Americans? They are families, college students in deep debt, people with serious health issues, senior citizens, first-generation Americans, single mothers, YOU.Remember when you were a kid and your friend did something to make you angry, so to get back at him you went and did something petty? You probably felt bad about it afterward. It was mean and beneath you and hurt others unintentionally. Unfortunately for many conservatives, hurting 7.5 million people unintentionally just because they don't like President Obama isn't a big deal. Is it because he won? Because he's black? Because he sought to help millions of low-income people out there looking for something stronger than Advil? I'll let you answer this, because I'm too busy worrying how my brother will get the health insurance he needs to survive.This piece was originally published on Thought Catalog. "
