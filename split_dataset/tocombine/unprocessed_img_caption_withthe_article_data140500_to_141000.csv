According to a new report by Moneysupermarket.com, one in ten people admit that hidden credit card purchases have played a part in their separation or divorce.Polling 1,000 men and women, the British price comparison site also found that 36 percent of those who had lied about their spending did so because they knew their other half would be angry, while a further 35 percent said they kept their purchases hidden because they knew their partner would disapprove. But it wasn't all frivolous purchases the respondents were keeping under wraps. While 50 percent of the people confessed to treating themselves on things like new shoes and clothes using their credit card, the same number claimed they were using their credit card for living expenses, including utility bills, rent, food and gasoline. Another interesting finding? While women were 60 percent more likely to hide a statement from their partner -- and admitted feeling more guilt for doing so -- it was the men who spent more on average. This certainly isn't the first time a survey or study has found a link between divorce and financial disagreements. In July 2013, researchers out of Kansas State University found that arguing about money is the top predictor of divorce. And in 2011, a study conducted by the National Endowment for Financial Education found that 68 percent of the time, financial infidelity has had a negative impact on relationships, with 16 percent of marriages ending because of it.Click through the slideshow below for more surprising divorce research.Keep in touch!

It stole all its ideas from dreams and from earlier works of art. Dali et al were great promoters and the impact of the Surrealists is such that when you are walking through ""La Renaissance et le Reve,"" the exhibit now running at the Musee du Luxembourg, you keep thinking how that the works of Bosch, El Greco, Bronzino, Durer amongst others exhibited epitomize twentieth century surrealism. One of the loveliest things about the show are its locutions. The same wine may be served in different bottles, but there are nuances that can't readily be translated. Thus the curators ask ""comment representer ce que reve un revuer?"" ""le reveur peut-il entrer en contact avec le devin?"" The show also points to the fact that the image of the sleeping woman is associated with dreaming using Ghilandaio's ""Allegory of the Night,"" depicting a naked woman, an hourglass, a lamp being lit and masks to make its point. Then there are the classifications of the show: ""Visions de l'au-dela"" (Visions of the Beyond), ""La vacance de l'ame"" (Journey of the Soul), ""La Vie est un reve"" (footnoting Calderon's 17th century classic Life is a Dream). In the Visions de l'au-dela category you have El Greco's ""La Reve du Phillip II,"" which is almost hieroglyphic in its complexity. But there are lots of royal and biblical dreams including Garofalo's ""Apparition de Sainte Pierre et Sainte Paul a l'emperor Constantine"" and dreams of Jacob by Ludovic Cardi's and Giorgio Vasari. No exhibit of Renaissance dreaming would be replete without Bosch's visions of apocalypse or at least one Durer dream (""The Dream of the Doctor "") and the current show even includes a book, Francesco Colonna's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili: The Strife of Love in a Dream. Guess what? You can find this one on Amazon!{This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog or rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"

As a new mom herself to 1-year-old son Camden with husband Nick Lachey, Vanessa can truly relate to her role.Here, YourTango.com sits down with the former Miss Teen USA to talk about her ""big guy and little guy” and more: YourTango: How is it being a working mom, juggling both career and baby?  Vanessa Lachey: Working on the show makes it easier because there's truth behind what I'm doing—it's pretty much who I am. And because it's a multi-camera comedy, it's basically a 9 to 5 job. I can wake up in the morning, get my son out of bed, change him and give him his morning bottle then go to work, come home and feed him, bathe him, and put him to bed at night.YourTango: Is Nick a hands-on dad?  Vanessa Lachey: Nick is extremely hands-on. Without him, I wouldn't be able to do it. I tell him that constantly. My heart goes out to single mothers. It's been challenging for us because Nick's been on tour all summer. Fortunately, he [came] home August 5 and I [went] back to work August 12.YourTango: Has having Camden made your relationship closer?  Vanessa Lachey: Yeah. We just got married two years ago this [past] July. We're still newlyweds, but it's amazing. I like to think that it hasn't brought us closer together, it's enhanced what we already had—he's the icing on the cake. It's been awesome. I feel very lucky, very blessed, and excited.YourTango: If you could tell your younger self something you know now about love, what would that be?  Vanessa Lachey: One thing I always did believe is that love is important; it should always be a priority in your life. But one thing I would tell my younger self is don't take everything so seriously in love. Trust is the most important part of a relationship, closely followed by communication. I think that if you have those two things, everything else falls into place—your affection, your emotional connection.YourTango: What's the best love advice you received?  Vanessa Lachey: Don't lie to your partner. Ultimately the expression on your face gives you away, and they feel betrayed by the lie. If this is the person you're going to be with—forever and ever, for better or worse—they will love you for all of your good and all of your bad. They'll love you for you. So open communication is key. I have no secrets and no skeletons in my closet with my husband, and I love that. I feel comfortable and at ease with myself when I'm around him. I love the woman that I've become with him.More Stories From YourTango: Win Everything You Need For A Simple, Scrumptious DIY Dinner Date How The Government Shutdown Is Causing Wedding Day NightmaresStill In Love!

The one that I really call love is when I feel like everything’s okay,2013-10-13,"Daphne Zuniga poses on arrival for the American Film Institutes 41st Life Achievement Award Gala Tribute at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood, California, on June 6, 2013, where Mel Brooks was presented with the award, considered America's highest honour for a career in film. AFP PHOTO/Federic J. BROWN (Photo credit should read FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d97e22100005100c595d8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The following is an excerpt from ORIGIN Magazine.Interviewer: Maranda PleasantMaranda Pleasant: What is that thing in you that you pull your passion from?Daphne Zuniga: I get really excited when I have moments where my head -- my mind -- disappears, and I get this moment where I start to tingle, and maybe sweat a little bit, when I’m in that space of feeling real connected with everything, every living thing. I first started feeling this probably as a child, but again when I started meditating. I know it comes from my meditation practice. It shows up everything now and then. It’s not an organization that I’m involved with and it’s not a thing I want to happen on the planet. It’s a state that reminds me that being alive is such a unique, bizarre, beautiful, electric thing, and it reminds me that a lot of the times, I’m not in that state. But that’s what turns me on. The purest thing. There are people in my life that I’ve met that have helped that happen. I’ll look at my boyfriend one moment and go, holy f***! In this moment I so love you just exactly as you are. Because all the other moments I’m subtly and not-so-subtly trying to change him. Fix him. Improve him. That turns me on. Where I’m just sort of shocked into the revelation, once again, of this planet is a living organism; this living thing, being alive, is a living thing. It’s every breath you take. That was the last one. It’ll never come back. You are riding on this wave of awareness, second to second to second. If you just sit and spend time with yourself -- you were born as you, just you, and that’s how you’re gonna die. Why do we spend the time in between trying to not be ourselves? That’s what meditation is. You just sit with yourself. Through all of it. It’s like John Patrick Shanley said: “Where the terror is, you must go.” Where the terror is, is where you must go. MP: What makes you vulnerable?DZ: Where I must go. Telling the truth. I finally have that with my boyfriend, and that makes me vulnerable constantly. Without vulnerability, you’re not really alive. Your vulnerability is your power. Sitting in your house alone, breathing through it. Calling a friend when you need to cry. Being really honest in your therapist’s office. Whatever it is. Bringing it into a role, for me. It is your power.MP: How do you handle emotional pain when it comes in?DZ: First of all, the true answer is, a lot of times it’s really unskillful. [laughing] My go-to reaction to true emotional pain is to lash out and to annihilate. After that gets out of the system, and if I have the wisdom enough and skillfulness, the next level is to admit the truth of it, and then give it space. Whatever the emotion is, I have learned over the years to give it space, which is also why I love acting. MP: [laughing] That’s perfect. What is love to you?DZ: Wow. Well. Two things. There’s a feeling that feels like what I’ve been told is love. It has to do with what Louis Schwartzberg said today about beauty, love, whether it’s squirrels outside my door, the rabbits, or the birds. They’re not trying to impress me or anything, and me watching them isn’t getting me or advancing me in anything. It’s just beautiful. When I think of the relationship I’m in, there’s a feeling that comes over me sometimes. The one that I really call love is when I feel like everything’s okay. That state of, it’s all right here. I spent most of my adult life looking for romantic love. I’ve been in therapy since ’87. What I learned was, that connection that I was looking for that I thought was really romantic love, my therapist literally said, “Well, when you feel that next, you probably shouldn’t go towards that for a partner.” She was trying to help me learn the difference. It took twenty-five years to find the man that I’m with now, and the feeling I feel about him is subtle, strong, amazing. I look at him and I smile. But I also look at him and say, “Can you please just put down the toilet seat?” It’s not like it’s perfect at all. But it’s there. The love, it’s there. The respect. The day to day has to bring you ease and comfort and safety. The waking up in the morning and going to bed at night, and everything in between has to bring you that. Or else what is the point?MP: Let’s talk about some of the things you’re involved with. You’re so passionate about so many things.DZ: I am. Women and girls, definitely. The one that I find is Equality Now. They’re based out of New York and they have offices all over the world. Gloria Steinem’s on the board. It’s basically a very small outfit of lawyers, and these lawyers go to the countries where there’s a case -- maybe a woman’s been burned, or genital mutilation, or trafficking -- they’ll go to those and find a case, and win the case so that the law changes. They go in and find an organization that’s living there, right there on the ground, and they’ll work with them legally. It’s all pro bono, because these people don’t have money. That’s what I love about Equality Now -- they’re these amazing women who go out and change the laws. Susan Smalley started the Mindful Institute at UCLA. She’s a scientist. She discovered Equality Now and got very close with Gloria Steinem, and brought me in, and some of her other friends. Now she’s going to have an incredible event on November 4, in Beverly Hills. We want to raise a bunch of money and bring more awareness to the West Coast for Equality Now.MP: Tell me about your eco involvement.DZ: About three and a half years ago, the mayor of Los Angeles appointed me to the board of a nonprofit called the Los Angeles River Revitalization Corp. We were given a little bit of money that we had to continue to raise so that we could sustain ourselves. Our goal is to bring the L.A. River back, which is a cement channel, thirty-two miles long. It runs through L.A., the Valley, down through Glendale, Burbank, L.A., and south. We have architects, real estate people, community leaders, and other nonprofits all on board to bring that river back, and to bring people to the river. We’ve expanded bike paths; we have a kayaking program so that people can go down, get in a kayak, and experience the LA River. If you go to thelariver.com, we’re on there under Revitalization. MP: What has been one of your biggest life struggles? DZ: Early on, my emotional work had to do with feeling unheard and invisible. My parents' divorce at six, when I was six, really affected me. We moved around and I was with my mom and my sister. I have learned, by the way, there were amazing gifts that came out of that. For one, I’m living my childhood dream. I feel very fortunate. That came from a single mom. My dad was in the picture, but it was my mom who was supporting us, took job to job, and moved us around to wherever we could live. She was a minister. She was an amazing, independent woman herself, who rode a motorcycle across the country, from East Coast to West Coast and back. One year, when she turned forty-something, she went off and climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro. Has hitchhiked from here to there. She’s a real adventurer, my mother. In one sense, I felt not seen and heard enough as a child. At the very same time, I’m watching her and modeling her. At seventeen, I left to go to Hollywood to pursue my dream, as if there was no other option. I only learned that, the gift of it, recently. And I often forget it.I’ve been acting since I was a little kid. It was my escape from my day which had to do with a father leaving, and a mother not being home, and her struggling and doing her best and all that. But it wasn’t fun. I would go into theater class. If she were a stay-at-home mom, I wouldn’t have that discomfort inside that kept me pushing.

(AP Foto/dpa, Soeren Stache, Archivo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb36ab5260000360082214e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sarah McBrideSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Among Twitter Inc's highest-paid executives, Christopher Fry's name stands out.The senior vice president of engineering raked in $10.3 million last year, just behind Twitter Chief Executive Dick Costolo's $11.5 million, according to Twitter's IPO documents. That is more than the paychecks of executives such as Chief Technology Officer Adam Messinger, Chief Financial Officer Mike Gupta and Chief Operating Officer Ali Rowghani.Welcome to Silicon Valley, where a shortage of top engineering talent amid an explosion of venture capital-backed start-ups is inflating paychecks.""The number of A-players in Silicon Valley hasn't grown,"" said Iain Grant, a recruiter at Riviera Partners, which specializes in placing engineers at venture-capital backed start-ups. ""But the demand for them has gone through the roof.""Stories abound about the lengths to which employers will go to attract engineering talent - in addition to the free cafeterias, laundry services and shuttle buses that the Googles and Facebooks of the world are already famous for.One start-up offered a coveted engineer a year's lease on a Tesla sedan, which costs in the neighborhood of $1,000 a month, said venture capitalist Venky Ganesan. He declined to identify the company, which his firm has invested in.At Hotel Tonight, which offers a mobile app for last-minute hotel bookings, CEO Sam Shank described staging the office to appear extra lively for a prospective hire. He roped in two employees for a game of ping-pong and positioned another group right by the bar.It worked: the recruit signed on and built a key piece of the company's software.In Fry's case, his compensation came mostly in the form of stock awards, valued last year at $10.1 million, according to Twitter's IPO documents registered with securities regulators. He drew a salary of $145,513 and a bonus of $100,000.Some might call that underpaid. Facebook Inc's VP of engineering, Mike Schroepfer, took in $24.4 million in stock awards the year before the social network's 2012 initial public offering. He also drew a salary of $270,833 and a bonus of $140,344. But Facebook that year posted revenue of $3.71 billion, 10 times more than Twitter's $317 million.Grant said more than three-quarters of candidates who took VP of engineering roles at his client companies over the last two years drew total cash compensation in excess of $250,000. Many also received equity grants totaling 1 to 2 percent of the company, the recruiter added.LORE OF 10XThe hot demand for engineers is driven in part by a growing number of start-ups, venture capitalists say. Some 242 Bay Area companies received early-stage funding - known as a seed round - in the first half of this year, according to consultancy CB Insights. That is more than the number for all of 2010.Another factor is the increasing complexity of technology. Many in Silicon Valley like to discuss the lore of the ""10x"" engineer, who is a person so talented that he or she does the work of 10 merely competent engineers.""Having 10x engineers at the top is the only way to recruit other 10x engineers,"" said Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy Ventures, an early-stage venture fund.Former colleagues said Fry, who joined Twitter earlier this year, fits the bill. The messaging service poached him from software giant Salesforce.com Inc, where Fry had worked in various positions since 2005, rising from engineering manager in the Web Services team to senior VP of development.Perhaps most attractive to Twitter is the fact that Fry joined Salesforce when it was also a 6-year-old company with big ambitions of taking on the software establishment. At that time, Salesforce's product development needed help, Fry has said in previous interviews. He whipped them into shape, helping build the company into one of the hottest enterprise-software providers in the industry today.Twitter has had its share of technical problems, such as the notorious ""fail whale"" that regularly appeared on screens during outages. That made Fry's experience all the more valuable.""All it takes is a couple of bad incidents where Twitter is down, or there's a security breach. That could be the end of the company,"" said Chuck Ganapathi, an entrepreneur who previously worked with Fry at Salesforce, where he was senior vice president for products.""You need somebody of this caliber to run it.""Neither Twitter nor Fry responded to requests for comment.PERSONAL DRUM STUDIOToday, even entry-level engineers can draw lucrative salaries in the Valley. Google Inc offered $150,000 in annual wages plus $250,000 in restricted stock options to snag a recent PhD graduate who had been considering a job at Apple Inc, according to a person familiar with the situation.The average software engineer commands a salary of $100,049 in Silicon Valley, according to Dice, a technology-recruitment service. That is down from $113,488 last year, due to an increase in hiring of less experienced engineers, said a Dice spokeswoman.By comparison, the average salary for all professions in San Francisco's Bay Area is $66,070, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Other jobs in the area can command higher wages - physicians make $133,530, a lawyer about $174,440 and a civil engineer makes $107,440 - but the tech industry often offers restricted stock or options on top of salaries.Even for plain-vanilla engineers, competition is intense, said Dice CEO Mike Durney, leading companies to go to great lengths to attract and hold onto the right people.Accommodation-search service ApartmentList rents a drum studio on an ongoing basis to help retain a key engineer, said CEO John Kobs.In one of the better-known examples, Google famously allowed engineers to devote 20 percent of their time on personal projects. It is worth it, many recruiters and industry executives say.Many of the most talented engineers bring more than programming chops, promoting the sort of career diversity prized in Silicon Valley.Take Fry, who earned a PhD in cognitive science from the University of California at San Diego in 1998. He is a surfer, a sailor and a snowboarder, according to his personal website.In a fitting twist for Twitter, known for its blue bird mascot, Fry also has avian expertise. His postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley, focused on the auditory cortex of zebra finches.(Editing by Edwin Chan, Tiffany Wu and Richard Chang)"
