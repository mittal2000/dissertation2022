At least two civilians were killed and six others wounded in Kubaisa, said an official at the hospital in Hit.Since taking Hit on Thursday, Islamic State fighters have raised their flags on the municipality building and police stations, while Islamic State vehicles were patrolling the streets of the town.Islamic State took advantage of refugees fleeing Hit to enter Kubaisa, 19 km (10 miles) to the east.A man escaping Hit, named Abu Saif, described approaching the checkpoint for Kubaisa when three or four cars sped up from behind them and shot dead the soldiers guarding the city.""We thought that they were displaced families as well. They didn't look like Islamic State militants to us,"" Abu Saif said.The radical Sunni Muslim militants have captured swathes of western and northern Iraq, including the north's biggest city Mosul in June, as well as large areas of the east and north of neighboring Syria.In Mosul, for the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, Islamic State released a video of its followers celebrating the day in Mosul, with children waving machineguns and followers holding its black flag.Elswhere, two bombs exploded just north of Baghdad in the towns of Tarmiyah and Husseiniyah, killing seven and wounding 18 others, police and medical officials said.To the northeast in Diyala province, an officer and seven soldiers were killed in two ambushes in the nearby districts of Mansuriya and Muqdadiya, according to military sources.

Duncan later had to be brought back to the hospital by ambulance on Sept. 28. In a statement released Thursday, the hospital said that Duncan had told a nurse that he had traveled to Africa within the last four weeks, and that the nurse followed protocols by entering that information into the hospital's electronic health records system.According to the hospital's statement, the lapse was due to ""a flaw in the way the physician and nursing portions of our electronic health records (EHR) interacted in this specific case. In our electronic health records, there are separate physician and nursing workflows."" The statement went on to say that, ""As designed, the travel history would not automatically appear in the physician's standard workflow.""However, in a ""clarification"" released on Friday, the hospital said that there was in fact ""no flaw"" in the interactions between the physician and nursing portions of the record systems.The hospital's reversal on its previous statement leaves the public with no clear explanation for why Duncan was initially released on Sept. 25.The hospital's full statement can be seen here: We would like to clarify a point made in the statement released earlier in the week. As a standard part of the nursing process, the patient's travel history was documented and available to the full care team in the electronic health record (EHR), including within the physician's workflow.Texas Health Presbyterian did not immediately respond to a request for further information Saturday.UPDATE: 12:55 -- During a press conference Saturday, city and U.S. health officials said they did not have any additional information regarding the hospital's latest statement.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said that the broader issue is the need to ensure that careful travel histories are taken for all potential patients, and that such information is shared across health care teams."

Practically, it controls the fate of Roe v. Wade,"" Goldstein said in a ""Meet the Press"" chat on Twitter.Thirteen abortion clinics shut down in Texas overnight after a federal appeals court ruled this week to allow a strict new anti-abortion law to go into effect. That leaves Texas with only seven providers, all of them concentrated in urban areas.Goldstein predicted that the justices would take up the issue of same-sex marriage, which has continued to gain legal recognition across the nation. Missouri became the latest state to join the ranks after a judge struck down part of its gay marriage ban on Friday.""[S]ame-sex marriage is the case of the (young) century. They have to take it. My guess is they hear the Utah challenge,"" he added.The high court passed up an opportunity to hear a challenge on gay marriage on Thursday. Justices have their pick of bans on same-sex marriage in Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana and Wisconsin, which have all recently been overturned by lower courts.Also on Goldstein's radar is yet another challenge to the Affordable Care Act. The court may decide to hear a lawsuit that, if successful, would eliminate subsidies to millions of Americans who currently receive subsidized health insurance under its state-run exchanges.""Way, way too few people are paying attention to this Obamacare challenge. It would destroy the statute,"" he said.The Supreme Court scribe also predicted that Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg would make liberals wait several more years before stepping down. Some Democrats would like the 81-year-old justice to retire during President Barack Obama's final two years in office, so as to not risk a conservative appointment should Republicans take the White House in 2016. Ginsburg has other thoughts, however.""Justice Ginsburg is going exactly nowhere. Not until after 2016,"" Goldstein said."
4,RELIGION,All Eyes On The Changing Catholic Family As Synod Approaches,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/catholic-family-pope-synod_n_5929020.html,,2014-10-04,"VATICAN CITY, VATICAN - SEPTEMBER 14: Pope Francis attends the Sunday Mass at the St. Peter's Basilica on September 14, 2014 in Vatican City, Vatican. During the Mass Pontiff celebrated the marriage of twenty couples. (Photo by Giulio Origlia/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f06724000032005728c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This article first appeared on the Global Sisters Report, a project of National Catholic Reporter.Chances are, you probably know more DINKs now then you used to. So-called dual income, no kids households are on the rise in the United States while both men and women focus on their careers, putting off having children until they’ve reached a certain level of success in the workplace. Yet, just a few generations ago, DINKs were unheard of, especially among American Catholics. It almost went without saying: husbands were the breadwinners while wives stayed home, raising the children who inevitably followed their marriage.Sixty years ago, a marriage like Dave Kolesar’s – gay, Catholic and DINK – was unheard of. But today, Kolesar and his husband, Patrick Wojahn, have been able to carve out their own comfortable niche in the American Catholicism. Married for nine years (three of them legally, after D.C. legalized same-sex marriage), they live just outside of Washington where Kolesar is a radio transmitter engineer and Wojahn is a lawyer and lobbyist. They don’t want children because their lives are too busy, but they attend Mass every Sunday evening.Are Wojahn and Kolesar at odds with church teachings on homosexuality? Yes. But then again, so are many American Catholics, 52 percent of whom support the legalization of same-sex marriage. Actually, over the last decade, the Pew Research Center reports that Catholics have consistently outpaced almost every other Christian groups in their support of same-sex marriage, despite the fact that the church’s unambiguous teaching that marriage is only between a man and a woman. Furthermore, when asked if homosexual behavior was a sin, only 44 percent of U.S. Catholics agreed.And that’s one of the topics some 250 people – most of them bishops – will discuss when they gather at the Vatican on Sunday for the third-ever extraordinary synod of bishops. Convened by Pope Francis, the group will spend two weeks exploring not just Catholic views on same-sex marriage, but how Catholics around the world do sex, marriage and family and what, to borrow the bishops’ language, is causing the “breakdown” of the family. And while much of the pre-synod discussion has centered on whether divorced and remarried Catholics can receive Communion, the issues up for grabs this month are wide-ranging, including poverty and the need for family-friendly work hours to premarital sex and a lack of concern about abortion.The fact of the matter is that, in the U.S. at least, many Catholics often express little interest in church teachings on certain family issues. For example, in 2012, the Pew Research Center reported that only 27 percent of Catholics who attended Mass on a weekly basis considered birth control to be morally wrong. When broadened to include all Catholics, that number dropped to 15 percent, and only 43 percent of American Catholics have a strong opposition to legal abortion.The way Americans view marriage, sex and family is changing, and Catholics are no exception. Divorce, while less common among Catholics than other Americans, is still more prevalent today before; in 2012, the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate reported that 28 percent of American Catholics who had ever been married had also been divorced. In 2007, the last time CARA published on the topic, almost 5 percent of surveyed Catholic adults were cohabitating with a partner.“In these times, a widespread social and spiritual crisis is posing a challenge in the Church’s work of evangelizing the family, the vital nucleus of society and the ecclesial community,” opens the bishops’ working document, an 85-page summary of a survey sent to parishes around the world last fall that will serve as the initial reference point for the synod.“To meet this urgency,” the document continues, “the episcopate throughout the world is being called . . . to listen humbly to the Holy Spirit and reflect on today’s pastoral challenges.”Conspicuously underrepresented in this discussion, however, are women. Only 25 women were invited to be part of the synod (that’s less than 10 percent of synod participants), and only one vowed religious woman. Although a handful of married couples were invited – a move largely applauded by those concerned that a bevy of celibate men would determine the state of the Catholic family – the overall lack of women bodes ill for a meeting many are hoping will do more good than the commission that preceded the publication of Humanae Vitae.That includes Sr. Margaret Muldoon, the sole woman religious who will be at the synod.In an email to the Global Sisters Report, Muldoon, the Superior General of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Bordeaux, said when she found out she was the only woman religious invited, she almost decided not to go.“I was totally taken aback and questioned the value of going,” she wrote. “On reflection, I came to accept that one is better than none!” At the synod, Muldoon would like her presence to help propagate a more nuanced understanding of the family – one that Catholic sisters have long cultivated through their work with families on the margins of societies.Muldoon wrote that she hopes the synod will be able to undertake a broadening of the church’s definition of family, one that includes the diverse families that are actually trying to live their lives within the church. Furthermore, she hopes the synod will be able face the fact that “truth can’t be put into doctrines and dogmas that are clear cut, that separate the good and the bad,” adding that no one, not even the church, is in a position to issue immutable directives for the family in any case.“Can we admit that we are at an early stage of understanding the good news of Jesus Christ and the way of being human that he offered and invited us to?” she said, which is not to say that Catholic sisters aren’t aware of the very real struggles of Catholic families. On the contrary, women religious working with young people and in family ministries are keenly aware of their pastoral challenges.Take Congregation of Notre Dame Sr. Susan Kidd, for example. As the sole campus minister at the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada, Kidd interacts daily with the very same young people the church sees eschewing their parents’ and grandparents’ view of marriage. Comparable to numbers in the United States, 11 percent of Prince Edward Island’s households are cohabitating couples, an issue of particular concern to the synod.“Do I see it? Yes,” she said from her office at the heart of the university’s campus. “It’s interesting because these kids will commit to a mortgage before they’ll commit to the sacrament of marriage, and they don’t see that as incongruous.”What they do see as incongruous, Kidd said, is the Catholic church – an institution they perceive as having lost a lot of moral credibility – demanding that they make nearly impossible financial decisions all for the sake of morality.“These kids are in debt from education loans. If they go all the way, they’re going to graduate with at least $80,000 debt, and that’s just kind of part of their lives,” Kidd said. So young couples move in together, jointly taking on a mortgage or rent in an effort to save money and pay down their debt.And if the relationship doesn’t work out?“It’s easier to declare bankruptcy,” Kidd said, “so they would rather deal with a bank than with faith or with judgmental people.”Judgment, however, is one of the things the synod hopes to move parishes away from, at least in certain situations – like teen motherhood, for example. Instead of being ostracized, the document reads, single teen mothers ought to be “esteemed for the love and courage with which they welcomed the life conceived in their womb and now provide for the upbringing and education of their children.”Cohabitation, on the other hand, is living situation for which the church may have grace (last month, Pope Francis, married 20 Roman couples, some of them previously cohabitating), but no patience. In fact, the working document lists the church’s teaching on cohabitation among a slew of directives (the others being those on birth control, divorce and remarriage, homosexuality, fidelity, premarital sex and in vitro fertilization) the bishops say Catholics simply choose to “overlook.”In fact, this so-called overlooking is so endemic that Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of Manila, one of the synod’s three plenary session chairs, had to admit that it hints at a shocking indication that Catholics do not understand the church’s teachings on family life.And that may be true.In the U.S., at least, some Catholics may genuinely not know what the church teaches about sex, marriage and family. Fewer are hearing it at church because they aren’t going (depending on whom you ask, the number of American Catholics attending Mass every week is either less than a quarter or less than half), and fewer are learning it in school since both the number of American parochial schools and the enrollment in those schools has drastically decreased over the last generation.Today, a lot of the responsibility for religious education falls on extracurricular parish programs, but how many families are really interested?To hear it from Notre Dame Sr. Bernadette Turgeon, the director of religious education and youth ministry at the Parish of the Transfiguration in Manchester, N.H., for some families, Catholicism has become something of an accessory they put on when it suits them to do so.“Kids are coming to make first Communion, and they may never have been in church until I bring them,” Turgeon said, “and we may never see them again.” The reason, she said, is because some parents don’t value religious education anymore. Instead, they see the sacraments cultural rites of passage.It’s one of her parish’s biggest family ministry problems, which Turgeon says she just doesn’t get. And when she asks parents why they want their children confirmed in a church to which they have no connection, they often tell her they want to get first Communion and confirmation “out of the way” in case their children want to one day be married in the Catholic church. (Which, incidentally, she says is not necessarily a prerequisite).“This one mother actually said this to me: ‘Sister, your church has the best aisle in the city for a bride to walk down, so I want my son to be able to be married in that church,’” Turgeon said, laughing.Turgeon says she has tried to meet the various religious education needs of the families in her parish. Youth attendance for religious education is high, near-perfect in some instances, she says, but her efforts to include entire families are often thwarted. For instance, when parents of religious education students said they wanted a special teaching Mass to help them understand the eucharistic liturgy, Turgeon arranged it. But no one came.She’s currently spearheading an effort to make religious education at the parish an activity families do together, though she’s aware that it’s an uphill battle. But in the end, she says she would be happy if she could reach just three or four families, encouraging them to make faith part of their family structure.“They do all these sports religiously,” she said, “some families, their kids are on traveling hockey teams, and they religiously go to every hockey game, no matter what part of the country it’s in. But when it comes to doing something with religious education, that’s not important.”On the other hand, some Catholics are all too aware of what the church has to say about family and sexuality. Dave Kolesar is a lifelong Catholic, but he walked away from the church after high school in part, he says, because what it taught him about himself drove him to suicidal thoughts. But today, he is quite happy. He and his husband have been worshiping with Dignity/Washington, a faith community for LGBTQ Catholics, since they met 13 years ago, and Kolesar says it was exactly what he needed.“I came back to the church on my own terms,” Kolesar said. “You sort of have to realize that your own sense of self-respect, your system of ethics — it has to contribute to your own sense of mental well-being. If there are church teachings that go against that, go against your own sense of self-worth, then you literally have to discard those teachings . . . the church is supposed to guide you, not drive you into the grave.”His husband, Patrick Wojahn, agreed, noting Christians of all stripes should be feel welcome and nourished at church.“For the bishops to come forward to set rules about how we’re supposed to live our lives and relate as a married couple is problematic,” he said. “It really calls into question what gives them the authority to be able to judge that – and I’m sure they would say it comes from God, but every person is fallible. No one person can be the arbiter for everybody of what it means to believe in God, or to be spiritual, or to be Christian.”And, yet, the inclusion of more Christians is exactly what Sr. Margaret Muldoon would like to see come out of the synod. All Christians should be allowed to participate in the church’s mission, she wrote to GSR, because God sent his son because he loved the entire world. For that reason alone, she added, the church should be more understanding of the Catholic family in all its iterations.“I hope we are prepared to really listen to the reality of people and to enter into dialogue rather than telling them what to do, be, think,” she wrote.In 2015, a larger meeting of bishops will meet to continue the work done over the next two weeks, and it is expected that in 2016, Pope Francis will use the information gleaned from both meetings to issue an apostolic exhortation on pastoring Catholic families. It obviously remains to be seen what Francis might say, but Sr. Sue Kidd, while cautiously optimistic, said she is encouraged by the fact that the pope even wants to talk about families.“When you think of the litany of issues that would be on his desk in the morning – holy smack!” she said. “But as long as the topic is on the table, I’m happy. It’s a step. It’s not the only step, but it’s a step.”Dawn Cherie Araujo is the staff reporter for Global Sisters Report, a project of National Catholic Reporter.For more stories from the Global Sisters Report, visit the National Catholic Reporter's site."

""COWARDLY ACT""Imam Asim Hussain of the Manchester Central Mosque said it was a ""cowardly and criminal act of appalling brutality, by a group who do not represent Islam at all.""Henning's aid convoy had been taking supplies to a hospital in northwest Syria last December when it was stopped by gunmen.Fears for his safety had grown since the British parliament voted last month to authorize British involvement in air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq.In the YouTube video, Henning appears to read from a script before being killed. ""Because of our parliament's decision to attack the Islamic State, I, as a member of the British public, will now pay the price for that decision,"" he says.Britain's Muslim leaders have in the past been accused of being reluctant to publicly confront Islamic extremism.Henning's case prompted a united response, however.Last month, a letter signed by over 100 British Imams and Muslim leaders said the threats to Henning had no justification in Islam. ""This is not Jihad (Holy war) - it is a war against all humanity,"" it read.Henning's wife Barbara and his two teenage children said they were devastated at the loss of a man who had cared about the welfare of others. ""He will be remembered for this and we as a family are extremely proud of him and what he achieved,"" they said in a statement.On Friday, the father of journalist John Cantlie, another Briton being held by Islamic State, appealed for his son's release.In Brussels, the European Union's External Action Service said the EU was ""committed to contribute to the fight against all terrorist groups that endanger regional and global stability,"" and would spare no effort to ensure that ""an end is put to this atrocious terrorist campaign and all perpetrators are held accountable.""

On Monday, he addressed a half empty UN General Assembly chamber and then came to Washington for what was reported to be a rather chilly meeting with President Obama. His United Nations' speech was classic Netanyahu -- ominous doomsday warnings coupled with red meat for the faithful, followed by misdirection and, for good measure, a bit of outright deceit intended for media consumption. The latter, most notably, included the Prime Minister's offer to the Arab States to join with Israel in creating ""a productive partnership that would build a more secure, peaceful, and prosperous Middle East"" -- the idea being something like ""we can't make peace with the Palestinians, but if you, Arab States, make peace with us, then we can work together to find a solution to all our problems"". This Israeli fantasy of making peace with the Arabs without first making peace with the Palestinians has been around for decades. It is, in effect, a desire to turn the Arab Peace Initiative on its head with Israel seeking to secure the benefits of regional recognition and normalization, while paying no price, in return. To the uninitiated, or the true-believer, the idea has some appeal -- making it appear that Netanyahu is taking the ""high road"" in fighting extremism and seeking peace. It is, however, a non-starter since it is something that no Arab leader, and most certainly no segment of Arab public opinion will tolerate. No Arab, at this point, will walk over the bodies of Gaza's dead or by-pass Arab rights in Jerusalem. There is another more fundamental problem and that is that Netanyahu wasn't serious. His proposal wasn't real. It was, instead, the sort of clever gamesmanship, playing for headlines, for which the Israeli PM is notorious. As is often the case, when he is backed into a corner, Netanyahu will try to maneuver by changing the subject. It was disturbing that instead of straight-away dismissing this stunt, the New York Times took the bait and headlined their report on the Israeli leader's speech and meeting with President Obama -- ""Netanyahu Sees Arab Alliance Aiding Mideast Peace"". The accompanying story began,Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday raised the tantalizing prospect that a new Arab alliance could resuscitate Israel's moribund peace talks with the Palestinians, but President Obama responded with a familiar complaint -- that Jewish settlements are the real problem.The headline and the framing of the story were misleading and disturbing, portraying Netanyahu as a visionary who sees new possibilities in a changing world, and Obama as stuck in the past with nothing to offer but ""a familiar complaint"". But wading further into this story makes it clear that the headline and the lead paragraphs were, in fact, nothing more than the misdirection, Netanyahu had hoped for. Right before the White House meeting, Israel had approved over 2,000 new settlement units in East Jerusalem and a group of hardline settlers, with Israeli military protection occupied a number of homes in Silwan, an Arab community also in East Jerusalem. Far from being just President Obama's ""familiar complaint,"" settlement expansion designed to frustrate peace and embarrass the White House is the modus operandi of the Israeli government -- which, by its very actions, makes it clear that it has no intention of reaching a just peace agreement with the Palestinians. In the aftermath of the horrific slaughter of innocents in Gaza and in the midst of the rapid expansion of Jewish-only colonies in and around occupied Jerusalem, any talk of an ""Arab Alliance"" with Israel becomes sheer nonsense. And the notion that Israel is now in an ""arguably stronger position in the region, if not internationally"" is also nonsense. With Israel facing a UN investigation into its bombing of UN facilities in Gaza, a Security Council vote on a pending Palestinian resolution to set a date for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, and growing international outrage over Israel's behavior in the Gaza war and its ever expanding settlement program -- Israel is, in fact, more isolated then ever before. And because the U.S. continues to be Israel's strongest ally, it is putting the U.S. at risk, as well. The very next day, the Times ran an editorial entitled ""Mr. Netanyahu's Strange Course"", in which they rebutted not only the Prime Minister, but the aforementioned article. They referred to the newly announced settlements as ""another in a string of calculated embarrassments that... have undermined American efforts"" and quoted the Administration rebuke that the new construction ""would bring international condemnation [that would] 'distance Israel from even its closest allies.'"" As is often the case, Netanyahu's clever, but disingenuous, ploys can't stand up in the face of reality. The Israeli Prime Minister may have initially fooled the New York Times headline writers and story editors. But in the end, the Times got it right when they closed their editorial noting ""Mr. Netanyahu's present course is antagonizing everyone"". Follow @AAIUSA for more."

Landrieu and her brother New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu endorsed Rep. Richmond during the event. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d86f200000f90101d384.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The following post first appeared on FactCheck.org.The National Rifle Association employs images in a series of TV ads of an intruder breaking into the home of a mother home alone with her baby to make the case that several Democratic candidates have “voted to take away your gun rights.” But the implication of the jarring imagery — that the legislators would prevent the woman from defending herself — goes far beyond the facts.Music in the ad sets an ominous tone as a woman in a bathrobe checks a baby crib in a darkened house before getting a text message – presumably from the spouse – saying they have “Landed. Miami.” She texts back, “Love You. Good night.” Then, a shadowy figure passes by a window before violently breaking through the front door. “It happens like that,” the female narrator says. “The police can’t get there in time. How you defend yourself is up to you. It’s your choice.”With images of the home now bathed in flashing police lights and cordoned off by crime tape, the narrator in a version of the ad attacking Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu continues, “But Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights. Vote like your safety depends on it. Defend your freedom. Defeat Mary Landrieu.”Similar ads target Colorado Sen. Mark Udall and Florida gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist.The implication of the ad’s imagery is unmistakable: the targets of the ad have voted or supported policies that might prevent homeowners from being able to protect themselves against a violent intruder. But the NRA has to stretch the legislators’ records to the breaking point to make that connection.First, and most importantly, none of the three politicians targeted in the ads is against people owning a gun or using it for self-defense in their homes. In its backup material, the NRA makes a more nuanced argument that the politicians have — in various ways — either voted for or expressed support for legislation that would limit the rights of law-abiding gun owners. It cites support for legislation that sought to expand background checks, or to limit assault weapons or large capacity magazines, or because they voted for the confirmation of Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan — both of whom the NRA views as hostile to gun rights.The NRA’s Case Against LandrieuLet’s start with the ad targeting Landrieu, as it has the weakest backing.There are three legs to the NRA’s case that “Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights” — and none of them hold any weight with regard to the implied claim that Landrieu would limit the ability of the woman in the ad to defend herself with a gun against an intruder.The first is Landrieu’s vote for the Manchin-Toomey amendment for expanded background checks. The amendment, created by Sens. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Republican, in the wake of the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, would have expanded background checks to private sales by unlicensed individuals at gun shows and over the Internet.In a vote of 54 to 46, the Manchin-Toomey amendment failed to garner the 60 votes needed to move forward — despite Landrieu’s support.So how exactly would that amendment have prevented a woman from having a gun in her home to protect herself from an intruder?Our fact-checking colleague at the Washington Post, Glenn Kessler, knocked down an unfounded hypothetical situation posed by the NRA — that the law would have prevented a woman threatened by a stalker, who lives in a remote area far from gun stores, from making the quick purchase of a shotgun from a cousin’s neighbor. But even in that narrow situation, Kessler noted the law would not have stood in the way of such a purchase.NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told us the vote on the Manchin-Toomey amendment “was considered a gun control vote” and that it would have “diminished 2nd Amendment rights.”Besides, Arulanandam said, that vote was “in addition to other anti-gun votes she has cast.”The NRA also pointed to Landrieu’s votes to confirm Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court — both of whom the NRA contends have been hostile to gun owners’ rights, based on positions they took in prior cases. We asked Arulanandam how those votes could have been a deal-breaker for the NRA given that Republican Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina both voted for Sotomayor’s confirmation; and Graham voted for Kagan’s as well. In September, the NRA endorsed the re-election bids of both Alexander and Graham.Arulanandam said people need to consider the totality of Landrieu’s record on gun control. But the only other votes cited by the NRA were ones Landrieu cast in 1999 and 2004 for amendments to close the so-called “gun show loophole” by requiring background checks on firearm transactions at gun shows. Expanded background checks “make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to obtain a firearm,” Arulanandam said.“As the ad said, Mary Landrieu votes to take away your gun rights,” Arulanandam insisted.But the ad does more than that. It shows frightening images of an intruder breaking into a mother’s home at night. We’re not going to wade into the debate about the inconvenience of background checks at gun shows, but it’s a long stretch from there to the implication that Landrieu would prevent the woman in the ad — and anyone else like her –from obtaining a gun for self-defense.Landrieu’s campaign notes that Landrieu has co-sponsored and voted for legislation to allow people with permits to carry concealed weapons in states other than their own; has repeatedly opposed a ban on assault weapons and high capacity ammunition clips; and that she voted to prevent the seizure of firearms during a state of emergency. And perhaps most germane to the NRA ad, Landrieu praised a decision by the Supreme Court to repeal a ban on carrying handguns in Washington D.C.; and voted in 2009 to “restore Second Amendment rights in the District of Columbia” and to repeal its ban on semi-automatic weapons. In other words, Landrieu has been an advocate for people like those featured in the NRA ad being able to keep a firearm in their home for protection.Udall, Crist & Gun RightsIn its backup material for the claim that Udall “voted to take away your gun rights,” the NRA again cites votes for the Manchin-Toomey amendment and votes to confirm Sotomayor and Kagan to the Supreme Court. The Udall campaign noted that in Sotomayor’s confirmation hearing, the Colorado senator specifically asked her views on the 2nd Amendment’s right to bear arms. According to an Associated Press account at the time, Sotomayor “told Udall she would follow a 2008 Supreme Court ruling that affirmed Americans’ right to own guns for self-defense.” But in addition to those votes, the NRA cites Udall’s vote in 2013 to regulate large capacity ammunition feeding devices. The proposed amendment failed 46-54.The NRA’s Arulanandam says law-abiding people ought to be able to possess the “firearms they feel comfortable with,” including those with large-capacity ammunition feeding devices.“People have to be prepared for the worst and plan for the worst,” Arulanandam said. “What if there is more than one attacker? … Our position is that law-abiding people should be able to have the upper hand in situations like these.” On the same day as the Manchin-Toomey vote and the vote to regulate large capacity ammunition feeding devices, Udall also voted against an assault weapons ban; and in favor of cross-state reciprocity for the carrying of concealed firearms. The Udall campaign issued a statement to us, via e-mail, stating that “the implication that he [Udall] would prevent a responsible gun owner from purchasing a gun to protect herself is completely preposterous.” The NRA backup for the ad about Crist, the Florida gubernatorial candidate, refers to an article in the Tampa Bay Times in 2012. In that article, Crist — who was reliably pro-gun rights when he served as a Republican Florida governor — said that in light of the “wake-up call” from the Newtown shooting, he now supported an assault weapons ban, a size limit on ammunition clips and tougher background checks.“We need to have some restrictions, that’s pretty obvious to most people,” Crist told the Tampa Bay Times. “What do you need a 30-clip magazine for? Not to go hunting deer. I can tell you that because I hunt deer.”There is enough in the article to make a case that Crist supports legislation that would infringe on your gun rights, but does this mean he is “opposed” to your gun rights? Even the Supreme Court has said that Congress has the right to impose reasonable restrictions on gun rights. The argument then becomes what is a reasonable restriction. But as with all three ads, the comment about Crist needs to be considered in the totality of the ad’s imagery.It’s one thing for the NRA to make the argument, in the case of Udall, that he would limit this woman’s ability to use large ammunition clips; or in the case of Crist, that she might not be able to use an assault weapon; or in the case of Landrieu, that the woman might have to pass a background check if she had sought to buy a firearm at a gun show. But the imagery of the ad goes well beyond any of those more narrow issues.To be clear, none of the three — Landrieu, Udall or Crist — opposes the right of law-abiding Americans to own a handgun, or to use that gun to defend themselves against a home intruder.We should note that there is also a version of the NRA ad, using the same imagery, supporting NRA-endorsed Republicans — including Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Senate candidate Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Those ads say the Republicans have “protected your right to self-defense.” (You can view all of the ads here). To that, we would add that the record shows their Democratic opponents, Alison Lundergan Grimes and Sen. Mark Pryor, respectively, have also supported Americans’ right to own a gun and to use it in self-defense against an intruder in their home.– Robert Farley"

Eighteen people were injured, including six police officers, according to local broadcaster RTHK.Student activists, established protest groups and ordinary Hong Kongers have joined forces to present Beijing with one of its biggest political challenges since it violently crushed pro-democracy protests in and around Tiananmen Square in 1989.Tens of thousands of protesters have staged sit-ins across Hong Kong over the past week, demanding the city's pro-Beijing leader Leung Chun-ying step down and China reverse a decision made in August to handpick the candidates for Hong Kong's 2017 leadership election.After police fired tear gas against mostly student protesters last weekend, the demonstrations have been largely peaceful.But on Saturday, some pro-democracy supporters - umbrellas in hand and wearing motor-bike helmets, gloves and black leather jackets - braced for trouble. Scores of yellow signs around the site occupied by pro-democracy supporters read: ""Police and mob working together - an alternative violent crackdown.""The pro-Beijing group, Caring Hong Kong Power, that organized the Mong Kok rally on Saturday afternoon said it supported the use of guns by police, if necessary, and also the deployment of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).Hong Kong leader Leung has said the use of PLA soldiers would not be necessary.One of the main student groups behind the ""Occupy Central"" protest movement said it would pull out of planned talks with the Hong Kong government, because it believed authorities had colluded in the attacks on demonstrators in Mong Kok.Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok said allegations police were co-operating with the Triads were false.The notorious gangs operate bars, nightclubs and massage parlors across Mong Kok, an area of high-rise apartment blocks across the harbor from the main protest areas.At times over the past week, police have left the streets, saying they wanted to ease tensions, though the reason for their apparent absence from this scene on Saturday morning was unclear.Police have defended their handling of fighting in the area, saying they had exercised ""dignity and restraint and tried our best to keep the situation under control.""But Amnesty International issued a statement criticizing them for ""(failing) in their duty to protect hundreds of peaceful pro-democracy protesters from attacks by counter demonstrators.""The Foreign Correspondents' Club in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Journalists' Association (HKJA) and local broadcaster RTHK all strongly condemned violent attacks on members of the press during street clashes over the past 24 hours.""Hong Kong is in a turmoil unseen after the 1967 riot. Without an effective monitor of the media, the condition will only deteriorate further, making any rational discussion impossible,"" the HKJA said in a statement.About 1,000 protesters maintained their blockade outside administrative buildings in the city center. PROTESTS ""BUT A DAYDREAM""The ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, in a front page editorial on Saturday, praised Hong Kong police for their restraint in the face of what it said was lawless protests, including ""poking"" of police with umbrellas.The protests will never spill over into the rest of China, the newspaper added. ""For the minority of people who want to foment a 'color revolution' on the mainland by way of Hong Kong, this is but a daydream.""Facing separatist unrest in far-flung and resource-rich Tibet and Xinjiang, Beijing is standing firm on Hong Kong, fearful that calls for democracy there could spread to the mainland, especially if successful. Demonstrations across Hong Kong have ebbed and flowed since last Sunday, when police used pepper spray, tear gas and batons to break them up in the worst unrest in Hong Kong since the former British colony was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997.At times, tens of thousands of people gathered to block roads and buildings in central areas of the global financial center, bringing them to a virtual standstill.China rules Hong Kong through a ""one country, two systems"" formula underpinned by the Basic Law, which accords Hong Kong some autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland and has universal suffrage as an eventual goal.But Beijing decreed on Aug. 31 it would vet candidates who want to run for chief executive at an election in 2017, angering democracy activists, who took to the streets.

Its capture would allow Islamic State to consolidate its hold on swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq.Swift offensives by Islamic State since June have sent shockwaves through the region and prompted the United States and its allies to carry out a series of bombing raids to halt the insurgents' rapid advance.Rami Abdelrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said several hundred people had been killed on both sides since the assault on Kobani started two weeks ago.The rumble of artillery could be heard on both the eastern and western flanks of the town on Saturday but the barrage was less intense than on the previous day, a Reuters witness said.Coalition warplanes destroyed one insurgent vehicle and killed five fighters during raids in the countryside to the east and south of Kobani on Friday night, the observatory said. Ten Kurdish fighters were also killed in heavy fighting that carried on long into the night. "

Batts announced Friday that he was asking for a review. The move was backed by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who said in an emailed statement that she welcomed any partners willing to work in reducing excessive force complaints. A day earlier, City Council President Bernard Young sent a letter to outgoing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder asking federal officials to take a look at the department.Young wrote that cases of people not charged with crimes suffering injuries at the hands of arresting officers ""damage the fragile relationship between the city's police officers and citizens.""Since Batts was appointed in September 2012, he said he has disciplined roughly 30 officers found guilty of misconduct.

""We have nothing to hide and everything to gain. Since my arrival I have not been afraid to bring outside reviews.

And even some de Blasio allies acknowledge the mayor could do a better job of leading the department he is simultaneously trying to reform.""This is difficult terrain, particularly for a new mayor,"" said Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who was on the mayor's transition team. ""Morale has been low on the force and it's only getting worse.""Following a pair of mayors who were largely lockstep with the NYPD, de Blasio was viewed suspiciously by police from the beginning with his fierce push to end stop-and-frisk, the crime-fighting tactic that allowed officers to stop anyone they deemed suspicious but a judge ruled sometimes discriminated against minorities.He drew their ire when he called a police official to inquire about the arrest of a political ally, who was later released. Police said the release had nothing to do with the mayor's request but the unions said the call made it seem like de Blasio was undermining officers.And the latest strain was the revelation that Rachel Noerdlinger, first lady Chirlane McCray's chief of staff and a highly visible face at City Hall, is dating Hassaun McFarlan, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in a 1993 shooting when he was 15 and later served time for drug trafficking. The news website DNAinfo reported that McFarlan's Facebook page, now taken down, had several posts referring to police as ""pigs.""The city's largest police union has called for Noerdlinger's dismissal over the matter.""It raises serious questions about her judgment and character and the quality of the counsel she provides to City Hall,"" said union head Pat Lynch.Although de Blasio defended Noerdlinger — ""We don't care what someone's boyfriend says,"" he said — the controversy shows no signs of abating. It was revealed that Noerdlinger recently joined McCray for a high-level NYPD crime-fighting briefing while he city's Department of Investigations opened an investigation into whether Noerdlinger failed to disclose that she lived with McFarlan. It later closed the investigation without recommending any disciplinary action.But it's de Blasio's close ties to Sharpton — who is also Noerdlinger's former boss — that has fueled much of the unions' anger.Sharpton spent months denouncing the NYPD for the death of Eric Garner, a black man who died from a police chokehold in July while being arrested for selling loose cigarettes on the street. A grand jury this past week convened to consider possible charges against the white officers involved and the entire police department is being put through use of force retraining.In a City Hall summit called to ease tensions, de Blasio sat awkwardly between Police Commissioner William Bratton and Sharpton, who proceeded to rail against the NYPD, saying the mayor's teenage son, who is black, could also be a ""candidate for a chokehold.""Police unions were outraged that Sharpton was given equal billing with Bratton. That became a central point in a full-page ad taken out by the Sergeant's Benevolent Association in The New York Times opposing the city's bid to host the 2016 Democratic National Convention.""The mayor has provided a public platform to the loudest of the city's anti-safety agitators,"" wrote union president Ed Mullins. The ad also claimed that City Hall's ""diminished support for police officers translates directly into crime spikes and drops in quality of life.""Mayoral aides strongly disputed any suggestion that de Blaiso's leadership over the NYPD had been compromised.""The mayor has nothing but the strongest support for the brave men and women of the NYPD,"" said spokesman Phil Walzak, who noted crime continues to fall.But experts said there are political risks for de Blasio if the complaints grow louder.""The perception that City Hall and the police are not on the same page does not usually sit well with voters,"" said Costas Panagopoulos, political science professor at Fordham University.De Blasio has repeatedly defended Bratton but the perception that Sharpton is given an outsized voice at City Hall has penetrated even the city's elite, as evidenced by a roast at the annual white-tie Alfred E. Smith dinner Wednesday night.""What a crowd tonight,"" Home Depot founder Kenneth Langone said, looking around the ballroom at the Waldorf-Astoria.

She never made it into the first draft, but that was one of the hard ones [to cut]. I just realized there are all sorts of quirky supporting characters that are just kind of strange little cul-de-sacs in the book that just weren't going to make it into the film. The key to a good adaptation is respecting the incredibly huge differences between a book and a film — and just kind of setting out not to save everything I liked from the book, but saving everything I needed to. It boils down to the plot, which moves everything (and is very hard to disassemble too much) and making these characters believable so you can go to the crazy places that the story goes.  Maybe the really fascinating thing about Desi's mom is that one of her descriptors involves smelling ""vaguely vaginal""?

Cardinals will hold a final set of meetings on Monday before they are locked away to choose a new pope to lead the Roman Catholic Church through troubled times. AFP PHOTO / JOHANNES EISELE (Photo credit should read JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f02d25000094003a0b22.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Public disagreements over whether the Roman Catholic Church can change its teachings on Communion for remarried Catholics are growing sharper on the eve of a major Vatican summit, with conservatives led by U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke making another push against loosening the rules.In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday (Sept. 30), Burke, who currently heads the Vatican’s high court, singled out the leading proponent of reforms, German Cardinal Walter Kasper, and his claims that critics of his proposals are really attacking Pope Francis.Kasper has said that the pope supports his efforts to find ways to fully reintegrate divorced and remarried Catholics into church life. The proposals have become a prime focus of the upcoming Vatican meeting, called a synod, which will convene on Sunday for two weeks to consider changes in family life in the modern world.“I find it amazing that the cardinal claims to speak for the pope,” said Burke, the former archbishop of St. Louis, speaking from Rome. “The pope doesn’t have laryngitis. The pope is not mute. He can speak for himself. If this is what he wants, he will say so.”“But for me as a cardinal to say that what I am saying are the words of Pope Francis? That to me is outrageous,” said Burke, who is reportedly set to be sidelined by Francis to a largely ceremonial post as patron of the Knights of Malta, a global church society based in Rome.Burke also said whatever Francis thinks about a more lenient approach on Communion for remarried Catholics, the pope can’t change current church teaching because he and all bishops “are held to obedience to the truth” about marriage, and that cannot change.Burke’s comments were echoed by others on the call and represent the latest effort by church conservatives to try to head off any possibility that the bishops and cardinals meeting at the Oct. 5-19 synod would open the door to changing any Catholic teaching, especially on marriage.Under current church law, divorced Catholics who remarry without first obtaining a church annulment — a complicated and sometimes expensive venture — are barred from Communion because they are considered to be living in sin. Critics say the practice alienates otherwise faithful Catholics and perpetuates the stigma around divorce.The high-level summit will cover a range of other hot-button issues, such as same-sex partners and the rise of cohabiting couples. The discussions will set out a road map for discussions at a larger, follow-up synod in 2015 where bishops could decide to make changes in church policies, or leave things as is.The focus of the debate as the process gets underway has come down to whether the church can change its doctrines or practices at all — and that argument has come down to whether Rome could allow divorced and remarried Catholics to receive Communion.Kasper, with the encouragement of Francis, last February opened the debate with a lengthy lecture to the world’s cardinals in which he said the church could and should adopt a more merciful approach to Catholics living in unorthodox relationships.A test case for such adaptations, Kasper said, is on Communion for the divorced and remarried. Kasper said that would not require changing church teaching on the indissolubility of marriage but only on the “discipline” related to receiving Communion.Opponents, including Burke, say that you can’t separate the discipline from the doctrine without undermining Christianity’s moral truths. They’ve become increasingly vocal and organized in lobbying against the reformers.* Earlier this week some 48 mainly conservative Catholic clergy and intellectuals — as well as prominent evangelical leaders such as Rick Warren – published an open letter to Francis and the synod delegates urging them not to dilute church teaching on marriage but to fight secularizing trends that they say have weakened marital standards. * This month, Burke and several other influential cardinals in the Roman Curia, including Cardinal Gerhard Mueller and Cardinal George Pell, collaborated on a book designed to counter Kasper’s ideas. * All told, as many as 10 cardinals aligned with the hierarchy’s conservative wing have written in opposition to Kasper.In an interview this week, Kasper expressed confidence that bishops at the back-to-back synods would ultimately back some change, and he hit back at critics like Burke, saying they are engaged in political maneuverings. He said they are afraid that any changes would lead to a “domino effect.”“This is all linked to ideology, an ideological understanding of the gospel that the gospel is like a penal code,” Kasper, who is retired from a curial job but lives in Rome, told America magazine.Critics of change in church policies are displaying “a theological fundamentalism which is not Catholic.”“If fear is at work,” he said, “fear is always a bad counselor. The church should not act out of fear. The church should be the people of hope.”"

The Dodgers won the series 4 games to 3. Koufax was the series MVP and played for the Dodgers from 1955-66. (Photo by Focus on Sport/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb76ef82600003600834cf2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On the field, Sandy Koufax wasn't just any baseball player. Off the field, he wasn't viewed that way either. The Hall of Fame pitcher isn't just remembered by baseball fans as ""the man with the golden arm,"" but is revered by his Jewish admirers as ""the left arm of God"" for his talent as well as the public observance of his faith, most notably during the 1965 World Series. A legendary left-handed pitcher who spent his entire career with the Dodgers, Koufax dominated batters like few ever have, atop mounds in Brooklyn and Los Angeles -- as well as just about every major league locale in between. His preternatural gifts -- notably that knee-buckling curve and relatively overlooked fastball -- earned him three Cy Young Awards and all-time great status in an injury-shortened career that lasted from 1955 through 1966. Five years after retiring at the age of 30, Koufax became the youngest player ever inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.For many Jewish fans, he was something even more important than a plaque in Cooperstown. The lanky, reserved product of Lafayette High School in Brooklyn was a role model for young Jewish boys -- and girls -- who dreamt big league dreams while also bolstering the hopes of Jewish adults who hoped to find success or even simply acceptance in an America they may have felt viewed them as outsiders.Koufax's roles as Jewish talisman and big league superstar intersected during the 1965 World Series. The opening game of series between Koufax's Dodgers and the Minnesota Twins was scheduled for the afternoon of Oct. 6, the date of Yom Kippur. The holiest day of the year for Jews, Yom Kippur is the annual holy day of atonement that is set aside for fasting, religious service and repentance.It is not a day for pitching in the World Series, even if you're the ace of the team representing the National League fresh off a historic Cy Young Award-winning season that included the eighth perfect game in MLB history. Koufax told Dodgers manager Walter Aston that he would not be available to pitch because it was a holy day. ""By refusing to pitch that day, Koufax became inextricably linked with the American Jewish experience,"" wrote author Jane Leavy in her bestselling biography of the pitcher published in 2002. ""He was the New Patriarch: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Sandy. A moral exemplar, and single too! (Such a catch!)""Reserved to the point of being considered reclusive, Koufax chose to speak little of his decision or his faith through the years. His few comments suggest the choice to remove himself from consideration for the start was not difficult to make.“Respect,” Koufax responded before the 2014 season when asked by Jewish Week why he sat out the game. He would also tell the publication that he felt ""no pressure"" from his teammates to start the game. With Koufax unavailable, Alston gave the ball to Don Drysdale, a right-handed power pitcher who was named the 1962 Cy Young Award winner and earned his own spot in the Hall of Fame. Despite his own formidable talents, Drysdale struggled against the Twins in the series opener, surrendering seven runs over just 2.2 innings. When Alston came to the mound to remove him from the game, Drysdale quipped, ""I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too,"" according to ESPN.com. The Dodgers would lose Game 1, 8-2.Back in uniform for the second game, Koufax was unable to even the series, giving up two runs over six innings as the Dodgers suffered a 5-1 loss. After the Dodgers won the next two games, Koufax twirled a complete-game, four-hit shutout in Game 5. The Twins would win Game 6 to force a winner-take-all Game 7. With Koufax on just two day's rest by virtue of having started the second and fifth games of the series rather than the first and fourth, Alston still gave him the ball. He wouldn't regret it. With the World Series hanging in the balance, Koufax pitched another complete-game shutout, allowing just three hits as the Dodgers won the decisive game 2-0. Tired and struggling with his curve as the game advanced, Koufax turned to his fastball in the later innings as Drysdale, with an extra day's rest, waited in case he was needed.Koufax would be named the World Series MVP and later Sports Illustrated's Sportsman Of The Year for 1965. Plagued by an arthritic left arm, he would retire after just one more sterling season. But his legacy was assured. Not only was he the pitcher that every lefty would be measured against, but he had broadened the horizon for innumerable Jewish kids. ""There are three things any self-respecting Jewish boy should want to grow up to be: a doctor, a lawyer, or Sandy Koufax,"" Alan Siegel wrote for The Atlantic in 2010. "

General Assembly approved the de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine in 2012 but the European Union and most EU countries, have yet to give official recognition.""The conflict between Israel and Palestine can only be solved with a two-state solution, negotiated in accordance with international law,"" Lofven said during his inaugural address in parliament.""A two-state solution requires mutual recognition and a will to peaceful co-existence. Sweden will therefore recognize the state of Palestine.""For the Palestinians, Sweden's move will be a welcome boost for its ambitions.With its reputation as an honest broker in international affairs and with an influential voice in EU foreign policy, the decision may well make other countries sit up and pay attention at a time when the Palestinians are threatening unilateral moves towards statehood.However, there is likely to be strong criticism of Sweden from Israel, as well as from the United States and the EU, which maintain that an independent Palestinian state should only emerge through a negotiated process.Within the EU, some countries, such as Hungary, Poland and Slovakia recognize Palestine, but they did so before joining the 28-member bloc.If the center-left government fulfills its plans, Sweden would be the first country to recognize Palestine while being a member of the European Union.The Social Democrats and Greens hold a minority of seats in parliament and the incoming center-left government is likely to be one of Sweden's weakest for decades.The former center-right government would not recognize Palestine as the Palestinian authorities did not control their territory.The Palestinians want an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza, with its capital in East Jerusalem. While Gaza's boundaries are clearly defined, the precise territory of what would constitute Palestine in the West Bank and East Jerusalem will only be determined via negotiations with Israel on a two-state solution, negotiations which are currently suspended.

""I'm not a scientist, I am interested in protecting Kentucky's economy, I'm interested in having low cost electricity,"" said McConnell Thursday in an interview with the editorial board of The Cincinnati Enquirer. In August, McConnell gave a similar response on the issue, telling Politico, ""Each side has their scientists, and they can all go in and argue."" He was a bit more direct in March, telling The Cincinnati Enquirer that ""for everybody who thinks [the planet is] warming, I can find somebody who thinks it isn't."" Actual scientists have weighed in, however, and have determined that man-made global warming is very real. Dodging a direct answer on science-related questions by pointing out the obvious -- that they're not scientists themselves -- has become a popular tactic for Republican politicians.Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) demurred in May when asked whether he believed in climate change, stating ""I'm not a scientist"" and trying to change the conversation to what his administration had done about flooding. In 2012, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) refused to take a position on the age of the planet Earth, saying, ""I'm not a scientist, man."" (Scientists have long estimated the planet's age as 4.54 billion years.)In September, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) sidestepped a question on evolution by saying, ""The reality is I'm not an evolutionary biologist."" Jindal is right that he's technically not an evolutionary biologist, but he is a Rhodes Scholar who studied biology at Brown University. Rep. Rush Holt (D-N.J.), who is a scientist, went to the House floor on May 30 and pointed that even non-scientists are perfectly able to weigh in on climate change: ""Yesterday, Speaker Boehner said he was not qualified to debate the science of climate change, but he was confident that all plans to deal with climate change would hurt jobs and our economy,"" Holt said.""Mr. Speaker, I am a scientist, but that doesn't uniquely qualify me to debate climate change. As Members of Congress, we rely on the expertise of others to inform our decision making. And I agree with the overwhelming consensus among scientists: the climate is changing largely as a result of human activities, and we can and must act now.""President Barack Obama has in the past mocked Republicans who use the ""I'm not a scientist"" dodge. In June, he joked: ""I mean, I'm not a scientist either, but I've got this guy, John Holdren, he's a scientist. I've got a bunch of scientists at NASA and I've got a bunch of scientists at EPA. I'm not a doctor either -- but if a bunch of doctors tell me that tobacco can cause lung cancer, then I'll say, okay. Right? I mean, it's not that hard."" Jonathan Chait at New York magazine wrote in May that using this line allows Republicans to avoid alienating their science-skeptic base, while at the same time not appearing completely untethered from reality. ""'I'm not a scientist' allows Republicans to avoid conceding the legitimacy of climate science while also avoiding the political downside of openly branding themselves as haters of science,"" wrote Chait. ""The beauty of the line is that it implicitly concedes that scientists possess real expertise, while simultaneously allowing you to ignore that expertise altogether.""*************************What's happening in your district?

Of the nearly three dozen films in NYFF52, there are only a handful that I haven't already seen that I actually wanted to see. Even then, because I live and work in New York, I'm able to see other screenings, aside from the NYFF press screenings, for most of those. Several others are films that I saw at Sundance or Toronto. The NYFF51 film selections -- the first after the 25-year reign of tedium of former festival director Richard Pena -- seemed to promise a less numbing devotion to intellectual exercises in cinematic aesthetics. But this year's slate seems to be a reversal of fortune, with an unfortunate devotion to what I refer to as ""oat-bran films,"" movies that are supposed to be good for you.As I said, as of today, I've been to two press screenings at NYFF25. One was the grippingly human film, Two Days, One Night, by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, which offers an Oscar-caliber performance by Marion Cotillard. This commentary continues on my website."

There was no indication that the new rules were related to that case.Growing international media interest in the outbreak that has killed nearly 2,000 people and infected 3,696 in Liberia has highlighted the challenges to the West African country's healthcare system.Journalists could be arrested and prosecuted if they fail to get written permission from the health ministry before contacting Ebola patients, conducting interviews or filming or photographing healthcare facilities, officials said.""We have noted with great concern that photographs have been taken in treatment centers while patients are going in to be attended by doctors. That is invasion of the dignity, privacy and respect of patients,"" Tolbert Nyenswah, assistant minister of health and head of Liberia's Ebola Incident Management System, said.""Ebola patients are no different from any other patients. We should do that (report) under permission so that we don't just take pictures or send out stories of naked people (in a way) that does not respect their privacy,"" he said. CUBAN MEDICS ARRIVEThe outbreak of the disease which causes fever, bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea has overwhelmed health systems in the three most affected countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea where it originated. It has also spread to Senegal, Nigeria and the United States.The first person to be diagnosed with the disease in the United States could face prosecution in Liberia for making a false declaration on an airport questionnaire if he returns to the country, Liberian officials said on Thursday.Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian, had helped a pregnant woman in Liberia who later died of Ebola, just days before he flew to Texas via Brussels and Washington two weeks ago. On an airport questionnaire meant to help control the spread of the disease he wrote that he had not had contact with an Ebola sufferer.U.S. authorities said Duncan was in a serious condition and four of up to 100 people he had direct or indirect contact with, have been quarantined.The World Health Organization has declared the epidemic an international public health emergency, and governments from the United States to China, Cuba and Britain have sent troops and medics in an attempt to contain the disease.A first batch of 165 medical staff - 62 doctors and 103 nurses - from Cuba arrived in Sierra Leone on Thursday to join the fight against the disease after more than two weeks of training with international experts at a Havana hospital specializing in tropical diseases.Another 296 Cuban doctors and nurses will go to Liberia and Guinea after their training.""We have 165 medical officers, qualified health professionals that are here to help us in the fight against Ebola,"" said Sierra Leone's deputy Health Minister Madina Rahman. ""As we know we need as much healthcare and professionals as possible. This will make a dent in the fight, we need more if we can get more,"" Rahman said.

Mayville Jr. speaks about the Syrian bombing campaign September 23, 2014 in Washington, DC. Mayville talked about the U.S. and Arab air strikes in Syria against the jihadist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d864220000bb01dd7cb8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the things that our ongoing military operation against the Islamic State does not currently have -- besides congressional approval, clearly demarcated goals, the sense that it won't turn into a long-term military commitment, or an exit strategy, I mean -- is a name. These things have got to have a zazzy name, for branding purposes. Remember ""Operation Enduring Freedom,"" and how much awesome durable freedom we got from that? That's what this war-ish thing in Iraq and Syria needs. But as HuffPost's Amanda Terkel reported Thursday, it might not get one:Lawrence Korb, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who served as assistant secretary of defense under President Ronald Reagan, said the Pentagon usually names military operations to bolster public support and bring attention to the campaign. In bombing the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, attention might not be what the Obama administration wants.As the Wall Street Journal's Julian Barnes reports, the main idea anyone has had for a name is ""Operation Inherent Resolve,"" which is a strange because once you start dropping bombs on people, stuff stops being inherent and starts getting pretty damned explicit. And insisting on the ""inherence"" of your own resolve sounds like the sort of thing that someone who is really unsure of himself does. So it's not surprising that ""Operation Inherent Resolve"" sort of landed with a wet thump at the Pentagon. Per Barnes:To some military officers, Inherent Resolve didn’t properly evoke the Middle East. Others faulted it for failing to highlight the international coalition the U.S. had assembled. Still others simply found it uninspiring.Well, if it's inspiration and non-bleh nicknames that the Pentagon needs, Eat The Press is here to help.
