0,POLITICS,EPA Finally Proposes New Smog Standards After Years Of Hesitation,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-ozone-standard_n_6225404.html,,2014-11-26,"UNITED STATES - MAY 18: Commuters clog a freeway on Friday, May 18, 2007, in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Jamie Rector/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dea9260000350083bd5d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON –- The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday announced new standards for ozone pollution that have riled up public health advocates and industry.EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy announced in an op-ed on CNN that the agency is proposing to lower the standard from where it is currently set, at 75 parts per billion, to a standard within the range of 65 to 70 parts per billion. She said the agency also would accept comments on whether to lower the allowable concentration even further, to 60 parts per billion. Public health groups had hoped for a tougher standard, while industry groups have said a lower limit will be too costly. McCarthy argued in her announcement that every dollar spent to meet the new standard would save $3 in healthcare costs -- ""totaling up to $38 billion in 2025, and going up from there.""Ground-level zone pollution, often called smog, is formed by chemical reactions between nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds emitted from factories, power plants and automobiles. Exposure causes respiratory symptoms such as airway inflammation, and is particularly hard on children, the elderly and people with respiratory issues like asthma. The agency has been at work on new standards almost since President Barack Obama took office. Under the George W. Bush administration, the EPA adopted new ozone standards in March 2008 to set the limit at 75 parts per billion, which was higher than agency scientists had advised. Environmental and public health groups sued over the weak rules, and the Obama administration announced a proposed new rule in January 2010 that it would lower the limit to 60 to 70 parts per billion.But then, after months of delays on a final rule, Obama himself announced in September 2011 that he had directed the EPA to withdraw the new rules as part of the administration's efforts to reduce ""regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty."" He asked the EPA to delay new rules until 2013. Environmental and public health groups again filed suit. In August of this year, a federal judge directed the EPA to produce a new draft rule by Dec. 1, 2014, and a final rule by Oct. 1, 2015.The EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee recommended lowering the standard in a letter to McCarthy in August, saying that there was ""adequate scientific evidence"" to support lowering it to 60 to 70 parts per billion. The panel strongly advised against setting it at the higher level of 70, however, concluding that it ""provides little margin of safety for the protection of public health, particularly for sensitive subpopulations."" The scientists wrote that the lower level of 60 parts per billion ""would certainly offer more public health protection.""According to the American Lung Association, the current standard puts as many as 186 million Americans at risk of breathing unhealthy levels of smog. Harold P. Wimmer, the association's president, said in a statement Wednesday that the updated rule was ""long overdue"" but did not go far enough. ""We are concerned that EPA did not include 60 [parts per billion] in the range, though it was the clear recommendation of independent scientists as well as health and medical societies, including the American Lung Association,"" he said. ""The scientific record clearly shows that a standard of 60 [parts per billion] would provide the most public health protection.""The American Public Health Association also welcomed the rule, while expressing disappointment that it did not call for a 60 parts per billion standard. “While EPA’s proposal does not include the stronger public health protections of 60 parts per billion this is a step toward improving health for all, especially for the millions who need protection the most,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, APHA's executive director. But industry groups are balking at the proposed rule. The National Association of Manufacturers put out a statement on Wednesday saying the rules would burden American companies. ""This new ozone regulation threatens to be the most expensive ever imposed on industry in America and could jeopardize recent progress in manufacturing by placing massive new costs on manufacturers and closing off counties and states to new business by blocking projects at the permitting stage,"" said NAM's president, Jay Timmons.Congressional Republicans have also been gearing up for a fight over the ozone rule. On Nov. 20, Sens. David Vitter (R-La.) and James Inhofe (R-Okla.) sent a letter to the Office of Management and Budget arguing that the rule would be ""one of the costliest rules ever issued by EPA and will serve as one of the most devastating regulations in a series of over-reaching regulatory actions taken by this administration."" Inhofe has pledged to subject the proposed rule to ""rigorous oversight"" when Republicans control Congress next year. "

Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab, and its surrounding areas, has been under assault by extremists of the Islamic State group since mid-September and is being defended by Kurdish fighters. (AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1417e2400003200229c80.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Amena BakrDOHA, Nov 26 (Reuters) - At a desert base, Gulf state Qatar is covertly training moderate Syrian rebels with U.S. help to fight both President Bashar al-Assad and Islamic State and may include more overtly Islamist insurgent groups, sources close to the matter say.The camp, south of the capital between Saudi Arabia's border and Al Udeid, the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East, is being used to train the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and other moderate rebels, the sources said.Reuters could not independently identify the participants in the program or witness activity inside the base, which lies in a military zone guarded by Qatari special forces and marked on signposts as a restricted area.But Syrian rebel sources said training in Qatar has included rebels affiliated to the ""Free Syrian Army"" from northern Syria.The sources said the effort had been running for nearly a year, although it was too small to have a significant impact on the battlefield, and some rebels complained of not being taught advanced techniques.The training is in line with Qatar's self-image as a champion of Arab Spring uprisings and Doha has made no secret of its hatred of Assad.Small groups of 12 to 20 fighters are identified in Syria and screened by the Central Intelligence Agency, the sources said.Once cleared of links with ""terrorist"" factions, they travel to Turkey and are then flown to Doha and driven to the base. GROUND FORCE""The U.S. wanted to help the rebels oust Assad but didn't want to be open about their support, so to have rebels trained in Qatar is a good idea, the problem is the scale is too small,"" said a Western source in Doha.The CIA declined to comment, as did Qatar's foreign ministry and an FSA spokesman in Turkey.It is not clear whether the Qatari program is coordinated with a strategy of Western and Gulf countries to turn disparate non-Islamist rebel groups into a force to combat the militants.Such efforts have been hampered by Western hesitancy about providing significant military aid, because it could end up with extremists. Gulf states dislike the West's emphasis on fighting Islamic State. Assad is the bigger problem, they say.""Moderate rebels from the FSA and other groups have been flown in to get trained in things like ambush techniques,"" said a source close to the Qatari government who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the topic.""The training would last a few months, maybe two or three, and then a new group would be flown in, but no lethal weapons were supplied to them,"" one of the sources said. SCREENING PROCESSAs the war against Assad has dragged on, frustrated rebels asked their trainers for more advanced techniques, such as building improvised explosive devices (IEDs), requests which were always denied.""They complain a lot and say that going back they need more weapons or more training in IEDs but that's not something that's given to them,"" said a Qatar-based defense source.The Qatar project was conceived before the declaration of the hardline Islamic State, when militants belonging to its predecessor organization were not regarded as an international security threat.The group's rise in Syria and Iraq has hampered the rebellion: Moderate groups cannot fight Assad when the better-armed Islamic State seeks their destruction as it strives to build its ""caliphate.""In recent weeks, the Qataris, disappointed by lack of progress in the fight against Assad, have started to consider training members of the Islamic Front, a coalition of Islamist rebels less militant than Islamic State or the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, but stronger than the FSA.None have been trained as yet, but Qatar has sought to identify candidates, the sources say.Some analysts say screening Islamic Front fighters would be harder than FSA rebels, since some Islamists have switched between various groups. ISLAMIST NETWORKTraining fighters from Islamic groups could displease fellow Gulf state the United Arab Emirates, which dislikes Qatar's support for the Muslim Brotherhood's international Islamist network.But Saudi Arabia, which shares the UAE's mistrust of the Brotherhood, is more indulgent of moderate Islamist forces when it comes to fighting Assad, diplomats say.Asked about the Qatari training, a Saudi defense source said: ""We are not aware of this training camp, but there's one thing we agree on: Assad needs to go and we would not oppose any action taken towards that goal.""To Qatar, ousting Assad remains a priority and youthful Emir Sheik Tamim has said that military efforts to tackle Islamic State will not work while the Syrian president remains in power.A source who works with rebel groups said Qatar had delivered weapons, mostly mortar bombs, to the Islamic Front and some FSA brigades about two months ago and had paid some salaries for Islamic Front groups.

4,BLACK VOICES,Pharrell Williams' Remarks About Michael Brown's 'Bully-ish' Behavior Surface,Cavan Sieczkowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pharell-williams-michael-brown-bullyish_n_6226960.html,,2014-11-26,"ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - NOVEMBER 22: Pharrell Williams performs on stage at du Arena, Yas Island on November 22, 2014 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

But I’m very troubled by what happened in Ferguson, Mo.” In the interview, published on Ebony's website Nov. 13, Hunt asked if the singer had seen the surveillance video allegedly showing Brown stealing cigarillos from a local convenience story and pushing a store employee. ""It looked very bully-ish; that in itself I had a problem with,"" he said. ""Not with the kid, but with whatever happened in his life for him to arrive at a place where that behavior is OK. Why aren’t we talking about that?""Hunt aligned Williams' remarks with Bill Cosby's sentiments about black society, publicized in a 2004 speech at an NAACP event. Williams agreed:And I agree with him. When Cosby said it back then, I understood; I got it. Listen, we have to look at ourselves and take action for ourselves. Cosby can talk that talk because he created Fat Albert, he tried to buy NBC, he portrayed a doctor on The Cosby Show and had all of us wearing Coogi sweaters. You’ve got to respect him. I believe that Ferguson officer should be punished and serve time. He used excessive force on a human being who was merely a child. He was a baby, man. The boy was walking in the middle of the street when the police supposedly told him to “get the f--k on the sidewalk.” If you don’t listen to that, after just having pushed a storeowner, you’re asking for trouble. But you’re not asking to be killed. Some of these youth feel hunted and preyed upon, and that’s why that officer needs to be punished.The ""Happy"" singer went on to acknowledge the harm of police militarization and omnipresent racism in America, saying: ""The hangover from Ferguson is going to be a long one, worse than Trayvon Martin,"" he said. After the grand jury reached its decision Monday, Williams' quotes were highlighted in articles published by blogs like The Root and Madame Noire. Some, including Jezebel's Madeleine Davies, criticized the celebrity:Pharrell has every right to his opinion and it would be fucking insane and wrong for me to try to inform or correct his version of the black experience. That said, after seeing Darren Wilson go unpunished for what he did to Brown (which is something that, in all fairness, Pharrell didn't know was going to happen at the time of his interview), we should probably be spending more time critiquing the American white supremacist culture where it's okay to shoot an unarmed teenager for allegedly stealing cigarillos than we spend critiquing why Michael Brown stole those cigarillos in the first place.This is not the first time Williams' comments about race have landed in the headlines. In April, Williams made waves discussing his ""New Black"" theory during an interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""The New Black doesn't blame other races for our issues,"" he said at the time. ""The New Black dreams and [realizes] that it's not pigmentation: it's a mentality and it's either going to work for you or it's going to work against you. And you've got to pick the side you're going to be on.""For his part, Williams expressed sadness over the grand jury's decision in a tweet Monday night. "

The report states that North Vietnam risks renewed war with the Untied States unless it lives up to the Vietnam cease-fire. As the last U.S. combat troops left Vietnam 40 years ago, angry protesters still awaited them at home. North Vietnamese soldiers took heart from their foes' departure, and South Vietnamese who had helped the Americans feared for the future. While the fall of Saigon two years later â with its indelible images of frantic helicopter evacuations â is remembered as the final day of the Vietnam War, Friday marks an anniversary that holds greater meaning for many who fought, protested or otherwise lived it. (AP Photo/Harvey Georges)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8de96220000bb01dd7e97.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Pentagon has hijacked the history of the Vietnam War, magically transforming it into a memory to honor and cherish. George Orwell never imagined better. The Pentagon omits any discussion of the deception and misdirected policies which sucked us into that quagmire. It ignores failures of both civilian and military leaders. The widespread breakdown of military command and discipline is glossed over and the military effort was led only by medal winners. The rending of the American social and political fabric which marked the 1960s and '70s is not acknowledged. Most of all, the Pentagon is unwilling to face the painful truth: we lost.The Pentagon has launched a 50th anniversary commemoration of the war to provide ""historically accurate materials"" for schoolchildren. Get 'em young.Will the Pentagon acknowledge the mistakes of American presidents and generals who for seven years steadily increased our commitment to more than 500,000 troops, the largest army raised since World War II? Will it recognize the growing public protests against the war, with increasing criticism in Congress, until eventually it was willing to cut off funding for the war, an unprecedented step which pointedly rejected the validity of the war? Most importantly, if our war aim was to preserve the independence of a non-Communist South Vietnam, where is a South Vietnam today?The human cost overwhelms our lost pride. Over 58,000 U.S. soldiers were killed in action; over 150,000 wounded; a downwardly revised figure of 1,641 MIAs; and contrary to organized, wealthy public pressure groups, no American POWs are in Vietnam and have not been since 1973. Let us not forget, 1 million Vietnamese lost their lives.Will the Pentagon's educational campaign include lessons learned from the war -- most particularly the lesson of the limits of American power and what critics of the time labeled the arrogance of American power? Such lessons remain blissfully ignored as we witness futile attempts of intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan.The spokesman for the Pentagon's commemoration efforts insisted ""there is no attempt to whitewash the history of the Vietnam War."" The Pentagon, he said, only wanted ""to assist a grateful nation"" in thanking veterans and their families. But what will the Pentagon say to Vietnam veterans who actively criticized, questioned, and opposed the war, then and now? Truth is the best thanks and honor we can render.We erred in intervening in a civil war, and then our military and civilian leaders made colossal errors for more than 15 years, errors resulting in defeat. We offer an obligatory bow to the brave soldiers who fought and died, all the more tragically because they were sent on a fool's errand, covered in arrogance and deceit. Pentagon in-house historians are determined to shelve the ""domino theory,"" that empty justification for the war which insisted that if we did not stop the Communist ""hordes"" in South Vietnam, they would be in the Philippines, Hawaii, and eventually on the beaches of La Jolla. Such theory is every bit as fraudulent as George W. Bush's 21st century search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. When Richard Nixon finally agreed to the 1973 Paris Peace Accords -- the peace that he and Lyndon Johnson could have had for five years -- he told the nation that he brought us ""peace with honor."" More deceit for the Accords offered neither peace nor honor. No one knew better than Nixon and Henry Kissinger, who cobbled together and then delayed any settlement because of domestic politics. ""Peace is at hand,"" said Kissinger, a month before the presidential election, and then waited 3 months before signing the agreement. They knew we could not ""save"" South Vietnam, only hoping for a ""decent interval,"" before the inevitable collapse. Nixon realized in 1968 that the war was doomed. Yet it lingered for nearly 5 more years, with another 25,000 American deaths. That is our shame.Le Duc Tho, Kissinger's North Vietnam counterpart, declined the empty honor of the Nobel Peace Prize; Kissinger needs to return his. Within months, and without a ""decent interval,"" our artificially contrived state fell to the rapidly advancing communist forces. No domino fell.Beyond the bravery and valor of our soldiers, we cannot expect the Pentagon to offer the flip side of war. They have reduced the savagery of My Lai to an ""incident."" We have ample documentation of the breakdown of discipline, the ""fragging"" of officers, the rampant use of drugs, and the repeated breakdowns in command. Teach that to children.The Vietnam War has been lost and obscured in the mists of history. Its lessons on the limits of American power are rarely raised and discussed; military circles are well aware of why and how we lost, as it is widely taught in the military academies. The lessons focus a recognition that wars have domestic political consequences; and to effectively deal with such situations, the military needs to sharpen their use of public relations. The current Pentagon website offers a lesson learned.Historical revision is as inevitable as death and taxes. New documents and evidence might reveal previously ignored or overlooked facts. New viewpoints, supported by fresh evidence, deserve a respectful hearing at the bar of history. But the Pentagon now offers history reflecting its own interests and needs, ignoring contributions of numerous, acclaimed historians. Its efforts are an elaborate hoax as it rewrites history for its own convenience, dismissing salient, painful facts. The Pentagon is not our Ministry of Propaganda. History is a potent weapon, dangerous weapon, especially when used to mold the minds of the young. The military is not simply providing materials for school children; instead it consciously seeks to scrub the real history of the Vietnam War. History should be a way of learning; it is not in this case.Stanley Kutler has written ""Nixon's the One"" with Harry Shearer, now on YouTube, and the play, ""I, Nixon."" He has written widely on Vietnam."

(AP Photo/Rahmat Gul)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14165240000360076f10a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This weekend, policy and thought leaders gathered in Norway for the Oslo Symposium on Advancing Women's Rights and Empowerment in Afghanistan, which was co-sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Afghanistan and the U.S. Department of State, along with the Afghan Women's Network, the Peace Research Institute of Oslo, and the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security. The symposium brought together government leaders, civil society representatives, Afghan and international experts, and an impressive Afghan delegation led by First Lady Rula Ghani to discuss ways Afghans and the international community can continue to work together to sustain and advance gains made by women and girls in Afghanistan. There is growing momentum in Afghanistan today. Millions of Afghans voted in the presidential elections, and the new unity government is enjoying strong support. On December 4, at the London Conference on Afghanistan, the Afghan government is expected to set out its vision for reform, and the international community is expected to demonstrate its continuing support for Afghanistan.Earlier in the week, the Asia Foundation released its annual Survey of the Afghan People for 2014, giving us up-to-date insight on what Afghans believe to be the biggest areas of progress and the serious challenges that still remain in their country. This year's survey included interviews of more than 9,000 citizens from all 34 of the country's provinces. This is a critical time to reflect on the significant progress that has been made by and for the Afghan people, and to listen to the priorities of women in Afghanistan.Afghanistan has changed significantly since the fall of the Taliban, and the ways in which Afghans view themselves and their country continue to evolve. As we see in the Asia Foundation survey, Afghans are more optimistic and hopeful about the future. Afghans are showing greater support for the Afghan Army, as well as support for the international role in providing technical and advisory assistance to the army and police. Afghans claim being Afghan as a defining feature of their identity.Although change in some of these areas remains challenging, the progress is well-documented. According to the survey, Afghans perceive some of the biggest problems facing their country to be insecurity -- some 65% are concerned about security -- unemployment and corruption. These are challenges that both men and women in Afghanistan confront, but women face an additional set of challenges -- and successes -- that are specific to them. Women want greater opportunities for education and employment, as well as protection from violence. Domestic violence continues to be pervasive.An interesting change that has come about in recent years is that women are seeking employment in steadily increasing numbers, and are demanding greater opportunities for education as well. This indicates that women are no longer seeing their place in society as solely within the home; many Afghan women see themselves as needed breadwinners who have the right to work. This shift in mindset is a marked contrast from a decade ago. Women are also reporting instances of domestic violence at higher rates, which suggests that women are now recognizing domestic violence as a crime that they feel able to report. The fact that Afghan women are prioritizing these issues is an indicator of the societal shifts that are taking place in large measure because of women's leadership and engagement.Many women fear that any future negotiations with the Taliban could lead to a reversal in the gains they have made. Numerous human rights violations continue to be committed against women and girls in Afghanistan on a regular basis. Women's full participation in the decisions of their government, including in any future negotiations to end the conflict, is essential if Afghanistan is going to solidify the gains that have been made and build a better future.When women progress, all of society makes progress. That is true in Afghanistan and around the world. The message out of Oslo this weekend was that we must continue to enable and empower the women of Afghanistan, who, as Mrs. Ghani noted, have a significant role to play in ""returning peace and prosperity to Afghanistan."""
