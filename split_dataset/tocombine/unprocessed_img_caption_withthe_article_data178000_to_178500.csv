Dear designers, what happened to below the knee or mid-calf?I know what this is. I'm being punished for having ugly knees. Ugly, round, dimply knees that I've always hated. In elementary school, my mother hemmed my school skirts above the knee to show what she called my ""cute, round, dimply knees."" I suffered the humiliation and vowed never to show my knees again.It was the '80s, and sure, the decade was a sea of fashion what-were-we-thinking, but despite the sickening wave of pastels and shoulder pads, a woman had a choice of hemlines. From trampy mini to hippie chic, every length was the right length.And sleeves. There were sleeves, too. Today, if it's below the knees, you're not allowed sleeves. Like those poor women on Say Yes to the Dress who buy the sleeveless wedding dress (do they sell any other kind?), even though they are not gifted with Michelle Obama's arms.So, what's a maxi dress-wearing woman to do? She buys a cardigan to cover her arms. Now, women everywhere are wearing dowdy cardigans and holding up their maxi dresses so they don't sweep the dirt off the street as they walk. Hmm... maybe that's why seven-inch heels are in vogue.All right. All right. I can hear the criticism already... Work on those knees! With beautiful legs, you reason correctly, I can wear the minis and get sleeves, too.But I'm walking on the stair machine (I could have climbed to Mars by now), and I'm so low on carbs that I doubt the existence of bagels, and I look down, and yep, the knees are still there.Who do I have to talk to? Michael Kors, are you out there? How about you, Calvin Klein? Can you give a nice woman with deficient knees a break? And sleeves?I'm counting on you, fashion designers. Make it work."
1,DIVORCE,Must The Visits With Our Children Be So Awkward?,"Linda Lipshutz, MS, ACSW, Contributor
Marriage and Family Therapist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/must-the-visits-with-our_us_5b9c3785e4b03a1dcc7d2b62,Non-custodial divorced fathers have a particularly tough challenge. These men are often at a disadvantage because they are not privy to the casual sharing that evolves around day-to-day interactions.,2012-09-10,Father and little son sitting on grass and looking at scene - Rear view,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c37852200005600d927ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We try not to stare. But we know too well that uncomfortable scene in the local fast food restaurant: that flustered father sitting with his children, trying desperately to keep the conversation going, as the kids' eyes are glued to electronic devices. The father peppers out questions, hoping to hit pay-dirt with a topic of interest. He receives one-word mumbled responses in return. And, sadly, the harder this man tries to engage his children, the more apparent it is that he's totally out of his league. While the above scene often involves a non-custodial divorced parent trying to make the best of awkward visits, it's just as likely we're observing a very much-married dad who's in charge of the kids while his wife is tied up. Historically, in so many households, mothers have been in charge of navigating the emotional and social lives of their children, assuming the responsibility of interfacing with the schools, peers and extra-curricular activities. And while the trend has been growing for men to take a much more active role in their children's lives, oftentimes, their schedules and discomfort get in the way.It's never too late for fathers to take active steps to improve the relationships they have with their children. Some parents assume they just don't have the necessary skills to build a closer bond and are defeated before they start. However, if they push through the discomfort, tolerating the missteps along the way, they may be pleasantly surprised to see how receptive their children can be.Non-custodial divorced fathers have a particularly tough challenge. These men are often at a disadvantage because they are not privy to the casual sharing that evolves around day-to-day interactions.Let's assume for the moment that everyone has taken the high road and the custodial parent has supported his efforts (a big assumption, of course). Children will still carry their own feelings about the break up and these emotions often spill over, impacting the ease of conversation. Having said that, divorced parents are likely to assume their children's moodiness can be attributed to the divorce, when in fact, so many other factors come into play. Divorced parents need to let go of their guilt sufficiently so it doesn't color every aspect of the interaction. Children may find it tiresome to be asked repeatedly how they're feeling about the divorce. When divorced parents become too defensive, they may assume an edge or impose pressure on the situation. Or, even worse, they may retreat with discouragement, assuming there is little they can do. Children may wrongly assume the non-custodial parent no longer has the time or interest. It will take extra effort to soften the hurt and to demonstrate a true commitment.There's tremendous value in taking the time to learn the names of their friends and teachers (and to remember them). Our kids pay attention to if we're carefully listening to their stories. They become exasperated if we don't know all the players in their lives and assume it's because we don't care. It often helps to contact the children's school and request the calendar. This heads off feeling hurt or angry if the children or ex haven't provided this information. Some of us have had our best conversations with our children in the car. When kids are fresh from an activity, we have a natural opportunity to ask casual questions. Showing interest and curiosity about their day is apt to promote further sharing. It makes a huge difference when we show we are truly open to hearing what matters to them, and won't be too quick to judge them or imply that we know better. Kids can also pick up if we're distracted and are having the expected conversation by rote. We can all demonstrate a true willingness to bond with our children by actively participating in activities as a family or one-on-one.It's important to remind ourselves that it's okay to have silent moments. When we rush in prematurely to fill the empty spaces, we may inadvertently head off conversation. Our children sense when we are trying too hard, and, feeling pressure, may resist. Take the lead from many experts who advise asking open-ended questions, rather than queries that let them off the hook with easy one-word answers. For example, when we ask if they enjoyed the basketball game, they might be inclined to mumble a quick yes or no. However, if we find an interesting question to ask about the game, referring to specific players or the coach's strategy, we're more likely to find ourselves immersed in spirited discussions. It's human nature for people to clam up when they sense another person is poised to initiate a heavy conversation. Our children often have a sixth sense and may freeze when we're about to bring up a tough topic. Trying to approach a subject in a conversational tone and watching our tone of voice may lighten the mood sufficiently.Most of our kids give us openings when they're troubled and looking for guidance. We just have to keep an eye out for the cues. Sadly, our kids often reach out when it's the least convenient time. We might be crafting an important email for the next day's meeting, heading off to a golf tournament, worried about a past due bill, or just preoccupied by life. If we tell them ""not now"" too many times, they may misinterpret our commitment to them and stop trying. It's so important for mothers, also, to examine their role in encouraging or discouraging the other parent's involvement. Some women have such a strong investment and pride in their relationships with their children that they inadvertently communicate they don't have confidence in the other parent. There's so much to be gained for everyone concerned when both parents are supported in assuming active roles in their children's lives.Our children truly appreciate when we take the time to put ourselves in their shoes. When we let them know that we are open to learning about their lives on their terms and refrain from preaching or talking at them, they often surprise us with their openness.Linda Lipshutz, M.S., LCSW is a psychotherapist serving individuals, couples and families.

2,DIVORCE,Do Doubts About Getting Married Predict Divorce?,"Robert Hughes, Jr., Contributor
Professor of Human Development, University of Illinois at Urba...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/do-doubts-about-getting-m_us_5b9c400ae4b03a1dcc7d5bfb,"To provide more insight into the significance of premarital doubts, Lavner and colleagues interviewed 464 spouses from 232",2012-09-10,Couple Getting Married at an Outdoor Wedding Ceremony,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c400a2200003000d92a9e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Do you still want to get married?"" my mother-in-law asked my future wife on the day we were to be married. Her intuition told her to be alert to premarital doubts, and she wanted to make sure my wife wanted to go through with the marriage. According to a new study by Justin Lavner and colleagues, reported in the Journal of Family Psychology, my mother-in-law was right to ask. Although there is a long history of folk wisdom about uncertainty before marriage, there has been little scientific study of this issue. There are two competing views about the significance of premarital doubts. On the one hand, it is not uncommon for people to have some doubts about making big decisions in their lives, and marriage is a big decision. However, there is also evidence that suggests that premarital difficulties tend to persist in the marriage. To date, there has been insufficient evidence to sort out these competing claims. To provide more insight into the significance of premarital doubts, Lavner and colleagues interviewed 464 spouses from 232 newlywed couples. The couples were all in their first marriages. The husbands and wives were older than 18, but younger than 35 years of age. They all had at least a 10th grade education. In their initial interview six months after the marriage, the scientists asked, ""Were you ever uncertain or hesitant about getting married?"" They also asked questions about marital satisfaction and other factors that have been shown to be related to divorce, including cohabitation, parents' marital history and neuroticism. For four years, researchers collected information about marital satisfaction and also whether or not the couples were still together. The researchers found that at least one partner in two-thirds of the couples reported having premarital doubts; 47 percent of the husbands and 38 percent of the wives reported being uncertain about getting married. This finding alone suggests that premarital doubts are common among couples and that men are more likely than women to have doubts. So what do these doubts predict about the likelihood of divorce in the early stages of marriage? About 12 percent of couples in this sample divorced in the first four years. For husbands, premarital doubts did not seem to predict divorce, but for wives, doubts did predict divorce. Among wives who did not report doubts, only 8 percent divorce, while for those wives who did report doubts, almost one out of five ended up divorced. Of course, perhaps doubts about marriage simply reflect a fragile relationship or other factors that predispose divorce. The scientists also examined whether growing up with divorced parents, living together, or having a difficult personality explained the findings rather than ""doubts about the marriage."" They found that premarital doubts still predicted divorce above and beyond these factors. The findings in this study are interesting and significant, yet as noted by the researchers, there are important limitations of the research. Two major limitations are that ""doubts about the marriage"" were measured after the couple had been married for six months, so this may not be the best indicator of their premarital views. Also, ""doubts"" were measured in a very simple way -- by interview -- and it may not be a good measure of this dimension of relationships.Despite these limitations, these findings suggest important new areas for scientists to study in regards to marriage and divorce. Likewise, if these findings hold up, it will be important for couples considering marriage to address the factors that contribute to their premarital doubts. My mother-in-law already knew this."
3,WELLNESS,Does Your Menopause Affect Your Mental Health?,"Mache Seibel, MD, Contributor
Global Leader in Women's Wellness and Menopause",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/menopause-mental-health_us_5b9c41dbe4b03a1dcc7d6640,"Many women worry that reaching menopause will tip their emotional wellbeing. If your menopause seems to be affecting your mental health, talk openly about it with your doctor.",2012-09-10,Portrait of a depressed older woman suffering from stress or a strong headache isolated on black,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c41db1f00002c002126a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since September is Menopause Awareness Month, here is the first in a series of articles on menopause. Many women worry that reaching menopause will tip their emotional wellbeing. Doctors typically blame estrogen, because estrogen levels drop in the years leading up to menopause -- the perimenopause -- and lower levels of estrogen can lead to hot flashes, poor sleep, night sweats and more frequent urination. All of these things can keep a woman up at night or at least disturb her sleep. And tired people are at more risk of being cranky and depressed. But midlife itself is also a time that many people are at risk for depression, mood swings and irritability. If your menopause seems to be affecting your mental health, talk openly about it with your doctor. Here are seven things to consider before you have that conversation:• Were you depressed before menopause? Could this be part of an ongoing problem that just got worse? • Are too many wrinkles and too little energy making you feel old and negative about yourself and lowering your self-esteem? • Is your life under increased stress? • Are you suffering from severe menopausal symptoms that are bringing you down? • Are you socially isolated -- no relationship, friends or family for support? • Are you having financial problems that limit your happiness? • Are you sad because you don't have kids or can't have any more kids?Here are some ways to help you feel better:• First, talk about menopause with your doctor. Consider estrogen and find out if it is a good choice for you or if not, what the alternatives are. • Consider talk therapy with a mental health professional or someone trained to deal with mental health issues and menopause. I treat many women who are in or near menopause and need guidance through this window of transition. Talking with friends or others who have similar problems can also help. • Discuss medical prescriptions for depression with your doctor to find out if this treatment would be helpful for you. • Get enough sleep. As Shakespeare said, ""sleep knits the raveled sleeve of care."" Click here for a free sleep diary to see if you are getting enough sleep. • Get physical -- start to exercise (walk, garden or go dancing) for at least 30 minutes at least four days a week. • Look for ways to de-stress -- listen to relaxing music, read a book or try relaxation techniques. Click here for a free relaxing song I wrote called ""Summer Day."" Breathe in and out slowly while listening to the song. • Use positive affirmations such as ""I attract only healthy relationships,"" ""I am capable and deserve success,"" or ""I believe in myself and others believe in me too."" Positive self-talk works.To further help you, download my free Stress-Busters eBook.

The special surprise at her Spring/Summer 2013 show, one of the Sunday highlights of New York Fashion Week, was a collaboration with none other than Google. With Google co-founder Sergey Brin seated in the front row, DVF sent several of her lithe models down the runway with the Glass by Google, the company's much-hyped ""augmented reality"" glasses, on their faces. For the finale, Von Furstenberg and creative director Yvan Mispelaere emerged for their bow and pulled Brin up onstage, all three waving and smiling in their own pairs of Google Glass.The purpose, reports the New York Times, was for the glasses to record footage from the models' perspective which would be used later for a short documentary film (debuting online this week, supposedly). ""For the past week, we've been using Glass to capture the DVF creative process from entirely new perspectives,"" the companies said in a joint statement.But it was also one serious exercise in brand synergy, as DVF's chic coterie of fashion friends, including Sarah Jessica Parker, delighted in trying on the glasses for themselves after the show. So will the show inspire fashion's tastemakers to purchase their own Google Glasses? Doubtful -- with their space-age feel and untrendy look (didn't anyone mention to Brin that it's chunky plastic frames, not delicate wire rims, that are in these days?), Google Glasses aren't exactly poised to take over the eyewear department at Barneys. Personally we'd be more inclined to wear them if they looked less like prescription glasses that still have the security tag left on and more like, well, normal glasses.But the documentary thingy should be cool, right?
