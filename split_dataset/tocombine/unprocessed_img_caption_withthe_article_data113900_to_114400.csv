Maybe they had trouble coordinating head positions as Gisele leaned in to tell Tom a secret about that man whose arm is in the photo. It's also not impossible that Gisele had a massive clump of spinach on her face, which Tom was trying to remove, using only his nose. They're probably making out, though. "

In response, Kaiser Wilhelm II ordered Alfred Graf von Schlieffen, Chief of the German General Staff, to develop a plan to successfully fight both France and Russia. The strategy he developed would have a profound effect on both the scope and the conduct of the war. What came to be called the Schlieffen Plan was not the first attempt to craft a German strategy to fight a two front war. Such a strategy had already existed prior to Schlieffen. Simply put, that strategy had been ""hold in the west and attack in the east."" The traditional invasion route into eastern France was through the Belfort Gap or ""Burgundian Gate,"" a relatively flat, high plateau between the northern rim of the Jura Mountains and the southernmost part of the Vosges Mountains. This was the invasion route that German armies had taken during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. Subsequently, the French had heavily fortified the area. An extensive network of new forts was built centered on the four ""front line"" cities of Belfort, Epinal, Toul and Verdun. The German General Staff reasoned that a breakthrough through the heavily defended Belfort Gap would be difficult - a point driven home by the subsequent slaughter at the Battle of Verdun in 1916. Its strategy was to pin down or ""hold"" French forces on the Western front while it first dealt with Russian forces in the east. Russian mobilization was expected to be slow. Germany's forces, were better trained and more mobile. The combined Austrian and German armies would deliver a knockout blow to Russian forces and force Russia out of the war. Bereft of its Russian ally, France could not hope to take on the combined might of Germany and Austria, and would have little choice but to sue for peace.In December 1905, Schlieffen began circulating his proposed plan to the General Staff. The first version of the Schlieffen Plan, there would be many modifications, reversed the prevailing strategy. It envisioned a rapid thrust westward with the bulk of the German army in order to envelop the French army and annihilate it in less than 45 days. With France knocked out of the war, Germany would then use its modern railroad network to quickly transfer troops to the east and deal with its Russian opponents. Russia, Schlieffen believed would need at least six weeks to mobilize. That would give the Germany army a window in which to defeat France. Even if the Russians were able to advance into eastern Germany, he reasoned, these gains would be short lived and would easily be reversed.By using its more rapid mobilization to its advantage, Schlieffen reasoned that he could bring the whole weight of the German army on each of its opponents in turn. The key to Schlieffen's plan was to engage and destroy the French army and quickly knock France out of the war. To do this he envisaged a broad enveloping movement into northern France that would bypass Paris and trap the French army between the German right wing and its central and left wing, and then surround it and annihilate it. A rapid thrust through the Belfort Gap, however, was unlikely given its extensive fortifications. There was one other alternative route, a thrust through the Meuse valley across Belgium to the English Channel and then a pivot into northern France. The Meuse Valley or Meuse Gap was straddled by the Belgian city of Liege, which was in turn protected by a chain of twelve forts. The original Schlieffen plan had called for an invasion of Belgium, and also of a tiny sliver of the Netherlands, in order to better outflank the Belgian forts defending Liege. Subsequent revisions dropped the incursion into the Netherlands. The Dutch were thus able to retain their neutrality during the war. The proposed invasion of Belgium added a political element to the Schlieffen plan whose consequences were not fully appreciated at the time. By invading Belgium, Germany made it a virtual certainty that Great Britain would intervene on behalf of France in the defense of Belgium. The Anglo-French accords of 1905 did not specifically obligate Great Britain to come to the defense of France in the event she had been invaded. Both the British General Staff and the British government had given private assurances to the French government, and its military, of their willingness to come to their aid, but it is unlikely that a formal treaty of alliance would have had sufficient parliamentary support or public approval to be ratified. There are too many possible ""what ifs"" to speculate how both the war and its outcome might have been altered had the Schlieffen plan never been adopted by the German General Staff. Had Germany pursued a policy of ""holding"" in the west what would France and England have done? Would France have invaded Germany? At the very least, given its preoccupation with the restoration of the ""lost provinces"" of Alsace and Lorraine, it is likely that France would have seen German preoccupation with a war in Russia as an opportunity to take back its historic territory. In such an event, the ""Western Front"" might well have been limited to a relatively narrow engagement in the 25-mile Belfort Gap and not the 200 miles of trench warfare that would ultimately result. In such a narrow theater, the participation of the British Army would have been superfluous. Unburdened by its 1839 treaty commitment to uphold Belgian neutrality, British involvement might have been limited to bottling up the German High Seas fleet in the Baltic and to defending the French coasts from naval attack by the German fleet. British involvement might have stopped well short of committing ground troops much less mobilizing the manpower of the Empire.In this scenario the conflict that erupted in 1914 might have been limited primarily to a war on the Eastern Front, a larger version of the First and Second Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913, and falling far short of the world war that resulted instead. The fact is that there was nothing inevitable about the outcomes that eventually produced the First World War. Had the cards that history dealt been played a little differently those outcomes could have stopped far short of the destructive war that resulted -- a possibility that made the consequences of the war all the more tragic."

(Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb76ab22200004301dd0e5d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Joe Fortenbaugh, National Football PostThe amount of time dedicated to fantasy football draft preparation varies from owner to owner, with one end of the spectrum hosting junkies who spend weeks gearing up for the big day and the other housing the aloof characters I like to refer to as “dead money.”Whatever side of the spectrum you find yourself calling home, remember that how you spend your prep time is just as important as the amount of time spent overall. Everybody is on the lookout for the next big sleeper, but a common pitfall for many owners is spending an inadequate amount of time identifying which players are headed for either a regression of full-blown meltdown of a season. Remember, the key is drafting the right players at the right prices.After dedicating last week to an in-depth preview of our top sleepers for the 2014 season, today we analyze those players who are being overvalued by the current fantasy market. Some will have respectable seasons, but at too high a cost. Others will flat out fall on their respective faces.ADP: Average Draft Position (courtesy of FantasyFootballCalculator.com)QUARTERBACKSCam Newton, Carolina Panthers (ADP: 81.9): This isn’t so much an indictment of Newton as it is the Carolina front office, who has done a piss poor job of providing their franchise quarterback with a capable supporting cast. This past off-season saw the departure of 53.4 percent of Newton’s 2013 completed passes (Steve Smith, Brandon LaFell, Ted Ginn and Domenik Hixon), which has since been replaced by 32-year-old Jerricho Cotchery, 31-year-old Jason Avant (who has never amassed more than 53 receptions in a season) and raw rookie Kelvin Benjamin. Newton will once again roll up some impressive numbers with his feet, but his week-to-week fantasy production should be highly inconsistent.Johnny Manziel, Cleveland Browns (ADP: 132.7): Johnny Party Boy currently boasts a lower ADP than veterans Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Ryan Tannehill and Josh McCown, all of whom will score more fantasy points this season than the former Heisman Trophy winner. I love Manziel’s antics as much as the next guy, but he is being severely overvalued by fantasy owners who are expecting a breakthrough performance in 2014. For Manziel to justify his draft position, he’ll need to beat out hard-working veteran Brian Hoyer for the starting gig, have wideout Josh Gordon dodge a bullet when it comes time to hand down a suspension and then—and this is the best part—he’ll have to go out on the field and start making plays. Keeper league owners are justified in taking a shot on Manziel sometime over the final few rounds, but everybody else should stay away.RUNNING BACKSDoug Martin, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (ADP: 24.1): More important than the statistical plummet Martin experienced last season due to a shoulder injury that limited the second-year back to just six games is the fact that he won’t be the workhorse runner in Tampa Bay in 2014. New offensive coordinator Jeff Tedford is on record detailing his desire to use a running-back-by-committee approach and the Bucs spent the 69th pick in May’s draft on West Virginia RB Charles Sims, not to mention the fact that Mike James and Bobby Rainey are still on the roster. Martin should be the Week 1 starter, but his snaps and touches will be less than what we’ve grown accustomed to witnessing over the last two years.Marshawn Lynch, Seattle Seahawks (ADP: 11.2): No doubt Lynch is a stud who will continue to handle the bulk of the Seattle workload in 2014. But he’s coming off back-to-back 300-carry seasons, saw his yards per carry average dip from 5.0 in 2012 to 4.2 last season and turned 28-years-old in April. It’s time for the Seahawks to get backups Robert Turbin and Christine Michael more involved in the offense and, as a result, we no longer feel Lynch is worthy of a first or high second-round draft pick.Trent Richardson, Indianapolis Colts (ADP: 53.3): Fool me once, shame on you. In 31 career NFL regular season appearances, Richardson is averaging just 3.3 yards per carry and is now on the verge of washing out of the league if he doesn’t figure out how to justify that first-round pick Indy sent to Cleveland last year in exchange for his services. Donald Brown’s off-season signing with San Diego freed up more of the workload for Richardson to handle, but Ahmad Bradshaw is back and healthy (for the moment) and the Colts just loss starting offensive guard Donald Thomas for the season with a torn quad. Stay away, no matter how good the price looks.Ray Rice, Baltimore Ravens (ADP: 57.7): He’ll miss the first two games of the season due to a suspension, turned 27-years-old in January, has 1,430 career rushing attempts on his legs and is coming off his worst season since turning pro in 2008. The upside is that the Baltimore offense was upgraded during the off-season and should find a way to improve on last year’s 20.0 points per game average (25th in NFL). The downside, other than what we’ve already mentioned, is the fact that backup Bernard Pierce could impress during Rice’s suspension, leading to a larger piece of the pie even after the starter becomes eligible to play in Week 3.Darren McFadden, Oakland Raiders (ADP: 95.0): After six years in the league, here’s what we know about McFadden: The guy has never appeared in more than 13 games during any regular season, has averaged a pathetic 3.3 yards per carry since 2012, has one 1,000-yard campaign to his name and maxed out at ten total touchdowns back in 2010. Throw in the fact that he’ll be 27-years-old come Week 1 not to mention the arrival of veteran running back Maurice Jones-Drew and fantasy owners are looking at yet another sub-par season from the former Arkansas standout.Zac Stacy, St. Louis Rams (ADP: 27.7): I like Stacy, especially after watching him bulldoze opposing defenses last season to the tune of 1,114 total yards and eight scores in 14 games. And I think the 23-year-old from Vanderbilt is going to have another productive year running behind the St. Louis offensive line in 2014. But the thought process here is that the third-round is a bit high for a back who averaged just 3.9 yards per carry last season and watched his franchise use a third-round selection on 2013 Heisman finalist Tre Mason. Stacy will be the starter come Week 1 and should hold the job for the majority of the season, but I think he’s being overvalued by fantasy owners heading into August.Knowshon Moreno, Miami Dolphins (ADP: 99.4): Don’t let last year’s career-high numbers fool you. That was more a byproduct of playing with Peyton Manning than anything else. Moreno has a lengthy history with injuries and won’t have the luxury of consistently running against opposing defenses hell-bent on stopping the pass like he did in Denver. In addition, owners shouldn’t forget about third-year back Lamar Miller, who we believe will win the starting job and produce an overall better stat line this season than Moreno.WIDE RECEIVERSSammy Watkins, Buffalo Bills (ADP: 73.7): The fourth selection in May’s draft is going to be a stud in the National Football League. But it’s going to take Watkins some time to adjust to the speed and consistent press coverage he will face at the professional level, not to mention the fact that quarterback E.J. Manuel is only entering his second year and is still developing as a pro passer. Keeper league owners are welcome to roll the dice with an eighth round pick, but the rest of you should look for more consistency and experience at the position unless Watkins plummets past the tenth round.Cordarrelle Patterson, Minnesota Vikings (ADP: 43.9): Based on the latest ADP data, Patterson is currently being selected higher than the likes of Michael Crabtree, DeSean Jackson and Percy Harvin. Why? No doubt the 23-year-old from Tennessee is a dynamic deep threat with speed for days, but Patterson hauled in just 45 passes as a rookie last season and will be catching balls in 2014 from one of Matt Cassel, Christian Ponder or rookie Teddy Bridgewater. With little to no consistency at the quarterback position, this is far too high a price to pay for a young wideout who still needs to improve his route running.Dwayne BoweForget about Dwayne Bowe...no matter what the price is. Dwayne Bowe, Kansas City Chiefs (ADP: 99.6): Since Bowe’s two-season stretch from 2010-2011 that yielded outstanding results (153-2,321-20), the seven-year veteran hasn’t done much of anything. The last two years have resulted in just 116 receptions and eight scores with zero 1,000-yard efforts. In fact, Bowe’s numbers were actually worse last season than they were in 2012 despite him playing in two more games. It looks to me like this guy’s best football is behind him.T.Y. Hilton, Indianapolis Colts (ADP: 59.0): A rising star whose target total just got derailed thanks to the off-season acquisition of free agent wide receiver Hakeem Nicks. Hilton should see a decent amount of snaps and will be good for a handful of big-time plays in 2014, but owners are currently drafting him based on his 2013 stat line rather than his role as the third receiver in the Indy offense. Remember, Reggie Wayne is healthy and back in the lineup and the coaching staff is keeping a close eye on second-year man Da’Rick Rogers. Barring injuries, Hilton won’t see nearly as many targets this year as he did last.Danny Amendola, New England Patriots (ADP: 113.5): He gets injured every season, has scored a grand total of just nine touchdowns during his five years in the league and has never topped 700 receiving yards in a season. In addition, tight end Rob Gronkowski is back in action and 2013 rookie wideouts Aaron Dobson and Kenbrell Thompkins will be expected to step up and take on bigger roles this year. Drafting Amendola, at any price, is just asking for trouble.Cecil Shorts, Jacksonville Jaguars (ADP: 118.6): His stat lines over the last two years have been respectable, but Shorts has a plethora of competition to contend with for targets this season as the Jaguars added wide receivers Marqise Lee and Allen Robinson to the roster in May’s draft. In addition, this is a football team that prefers to grind it out via the ground game and, despite lackluster results over the last few seasons, is getting better under second-year head coach Gus Bradley, which means less garbage time opportunities for Shorts in 2014.TIGHT ENDSKyle Rudolph, Minnesota Vikings (ADP: 94.8): If he played on a team with a viable starting quarterback, Rudolph would be one of the most prolific tight ends in the league. But that’s not the case, as the newly-minted three-year veteran will be catching passes from some combination of Matt Cassel, Christian Ponder and Teddy Bridgewater in 2014. Despite his impressive skill set, Rudolph was only able to muster 30 receptions for 313 yards and three scores last season due to a combination of injuries and poor quarterback play. There are better options out there for a cheaper price.DEFENSE/SPECIAL TEAMSCarolina Panthers (ADP: 114.6): In terms of talent and pedigree, Carolina’s got both in spades. The problem, however, is twofold. First, defensive end Greg Hardy and his career-high 15.0 sacks in 2013 are headed for a suspension. Second, the Panthers’ offense is going to struggle this year, resulting in more three-and-outs meaning more time on the field with less rest for the defensive unit. This is still a terrific NFL defense, but we don’t feel they’re worthy of being the third D/ST off the board, as current ADP data indicates.Arizona Cardinals (ADP: 137.8): Arizona’s two leading tacklers from 2013 are gone, as Karlos Dansby bolted for the big payday in Cleveland while Daryl Washington was hit with a one-year suspension due to a violation of the league’s substance abuse policy. Additionally, outside linebacker John Abraham is looking at a suspension for a recent DUI offense while cornerback Antonio Cromartie and defensive tackle Darnell Dockett are both on the wrong side of 30. This is a good unit, but it needs to be complemented with another D/ST so owners can play the more favorable weekly matchup.Hit me up on Twitter: @JoeFortenbaugh"

But it also raised an issue for journalists: if the president of the United States can call torture by its real name, why can't they?By now, the story of the media's hesitancy around the term ""torture""—at least when it applies to American actions—is well-known. So is the fact that elite outlets began finding new terms to describe practices they once labeled torture right around the time that the Bush administration began insisting that it wasn't torturing anyone. That shift is still firmly in place.Many of the press reports about Obama's comments avoided using the term when they weren't quoting him directly. The New York Times referred to ""brutal interrogation"" and ""the conduct of some in the intelligence community."" The Los Angeles Times wrote that Obama had ""acknowledged the CIA’s use of brutal interrogation tactics"" and also, in something of an understatement, mentioned ""sometimes-grisly tactics."" USA Today used the phrases ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" and ""disputed interrogation techniques.""Other outlets, such as the Associated Press, split the difference, going back and forth between using the word and using euphemisms:The United States tortured al Qaida detainees captured after the 9/11 attacks, President Obama said Friday, in some of his most expansive comments to date about a controversial set of CIA practices that he banned after taking office."

The United Nations was more guarded in its censure of Hamas but demanded Goldin's release.Seeking to shift responsibility, Hamas said it believed its gunmen had struck before Friday's ceasefire began and that if they captured Goldin, he probably died with his captors in heavy Israeli barrages that followed.A Palestinian delegation was to fly to Cairo for new truce talks, which would include Hamas's demand Egypt ease movement across its border with blockaded Gaza. Turning its back on those negotiations, Israel said it would not send envoys as scheduled.""They (Hamas) cannot be trusted to keep their word. They cannot stop (firing) because, for them, a ceasefire at this stage, whether by arrangement or not by arrangement, would mean acknowledging the worst possible defeat,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Tzachi Hanegbi told Israel's Channel Two TV.""I believe this is the point at which the ground maneuvers should be brought to an end. Hamas can be hit as much as will be required in response to firing that, I expect, will persist.""A poll by Israel's Channel Ten TV found 32 percent of the public wanted a truce, 31 percent wanted ground forces withdrawn even without a halt to hostilities, and 31 percent wanted the military to step up operations, reoccupy Gaza and topple Hamas.Hamas, its guerrillas massively outgunned by a Jewish state it considers an eternal enemy, said it would prevail.Any unilateral pullout by Israel would mean ""it has failed to achieve any of its goals and would be a clear defeat for the occupation army and for its leaders,"" Hamas's bloc in the Palestinian parliament said in a statement. ""Gaza resisted, endured and will achieve victory."" TUNNEL HUNTIsrael launched a Gaza air and naval offensive on July 8 following a surge of cross-border rocket salvoes by Hamas and other Palestinian guerrillas, later escalating into ground incursions centered along the infiltration tunnel-riddled eastern frontier of the enclave but often pushing into urban areas.With U.S. backing, Israel had said that whether or not there is a ceasefire its forces would pursue their main mission of hunting tunnels used by Hamas for several cross-border attacks. More than 30 of these, and dozens of access shafts, have already been unearthed and were being blown up, the military said.""Our understanding is that our objectives, most importantly the destruction of the tunnels, are close to completion,"" a military spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner, said.Crowded Gazan towns close to the Israeli border have seen devastating clashes, and the flight of tens of thousands of Palestinians, as tanks and troops swept in to confront dug-in guerrillas after the army warned civilians to evacuate.The Palestinian Center for Human Rights said 520,000 people had been displaced by the fighting - more than a quarter of Gaza's population. Another group, the Al-Mezan Center for Human Rights, said some 3,000 homes had been totally or partly razed.Israel said on Saturday evacuees from Beit Lahiya, a northern town of 70,000 residents, could return. But fear still gripped the townspeople.""No one has told us to go back,"" said Talab Manna, a 30-year-old father of seven camped out at a U.N.-run school serving as a refugee haven. ""We can't risk going back and being bombed by the Israeli forces.""After Friday's ceasefire was shattered, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called his security cabinet into special session to discuss Goldin's suspected capture in the southern town of Rafah, and warned Hamas and other Palestinian guerrillas would ""bear the consequences of their actions"".But Israeli media said Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon would likely hold course in Gaza rather than escalate.Citing an internal investigation complicated by inability to communicate with its gunmen in the Rafah area, Hamas's armed wing said on Saturday it believed their ambush happened an hour before the truce began, in response to Israeli troop advances.Hamas said it did not know what had happened to the soldier but if he was captured, he probably died in Israeli hostilities that followed the ambush.Quoting a senior military officer, Israel Radio also said Goldin's condition was not known. It said he was last seen next to the two troops killed by a Hamas suicide bomber - suggesting Goldin may not have survived and his captors had a corpse.Israel has confirmed that 63 soldiers have died in combat. Palestinian shelling has also killed three civilians in Israel.Hamas had long threatened to capture Israelis for a prisoner swap. In 2011, Israel released more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Gilad Shalit, a soldier snatched by Hamas five years earlier. Israel has twice freed prisoners for the bodies of soldiers held by Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. RAFAH IN RUINSThe Rafah clash triggered Israeli shelling from the middle of Friday morning that killed 150 Palestinians. By afternoon, Israel declared an end to the truce - which was meant to have lasted 72 hours, allowing humanitarian relief to reach Gaza's 1.8 million Palestinians and for further de-escalation talks.Rafah residents said they had received recorded telephone warnings from Israel to stay indoors during a barrage that wreaked widespread ruin. Medical officials on Saturday counted at least a dozen homes destroyed.""It was like an action movie - explosions everywhere, cars flying up in flames, people crushed under houses that were bombed,"" local man Bassim Abed told Reuters.Ashraf Goma, Palestinian lawmaker from Abbas's Fatah party said 50,000 people in villages to the east of the town had been displaced. He accused Israel of committing a war crime.Among targets of Israeli air strikes on Saturday was a building in the Islamic University campus in Gaza City. The military said the building had been used by Hamas for weapons research and development.Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi cast Cairo's truce efforts as worth pursuing.""The Egyptian initiative is a real chance to find a real solution to the crisis taking place in the Gaza Strip,"" he said. ""Lost time ... complicates the situation more and more."" (Writing by Dan Williams; Additional reporting by Mostafa Hashem and Oliver Holmes in Cairo; Editing by Giles Elgood)"

The extradition of a white Orthodox Jewish man to New York City to face hate crime charges over a black manâs attack has renewed questions about the case. Supporters of Shuchat say thereâs no evidence of racial hatred in the 2008 street encounter he had with Andrew Charles. (AP Photo/NYPD, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e69c463230000321ade31b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK (AP) — Yitzhak Shuchat, a white member of a civilian patrol group, and Andrew Charles, the black son of a police officer, came face to face in 2008 in a neighborhood with a history of racial strife — that much is certain.But six years later, the circumstances of the encounter in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn remain murky, even as prosecutors pursue charges against 28-year-old Shuchat alleging he attacked Charles because of his race. Shuchat's supporters in the neighborhood's Orthodox Jewish community have reacted with dismay over what they call a hate crime investigation gone awry.Authorities ""took a minor incident and made it into a very serious situation,"" said state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who is Jewish. ""This could have been resolved a long time ago. It makes absolutely no sense.""The case received renewed attention last month when deputy U.S. Marshals retrieved Shuchat from Israel after he lost a lengthy extradition fight. He pleaded not guilty July 18 in a Brooklyn court to second-degree assault as a hate crime, attempted assault and other charges and was released on $300,000 bail put up by Jewish benefactors.Prosecutors have yet to explain why they're treating the case as a racial incident, said Shuchat's attorney, Paul Batista. In other hate crime cases, there are typically racial slurs or other clear evidence of bias.""I don't know where the hate element came in,"" Batista said. ""Yitzy has no racial animus toward anyone.""Asked in a recent television interview to describe their encounter, Charles responded, ""They attacked us, and that's about it."" He didn't elaborate.The Brooklyn district attorney's office declined to comment.The case resurrected old wounds in Crown Heights, where violence exploded in 1991 after a black child, Gavin Cato, was accidentally hit and killed by a car in a Jewish motorcade. A group of blacks responded by stabbing to death a rabbinical student from Australia who was walking down the street.Over the years the tensions in Crown Heights have dissipated as the neighborhood has become more gentrified. But occasional violence linked to race or religion has persisted — and can still stir up old fears.In 2008, the New York Police Department increased patrols in Crown Heights after the incident with Charles and a report that a Jewish teenager was robbed and beaten by black kids.According to police, Charles was walking with a black friend when they they were confronted by a white man who pepper-sprayed Charles. Then an SUV pulled up and a white passenger — later identified by police as Shuchat — jumped out and hit him with a nightstick.Authorities concluded Shuchat and the other man were volunteers with the civilian patrol, Shmira, and convened a grand jury to look into the matter — a move criticized by the Jewish community but welcomed by black leaders.""You can't have a group, whether it's the Bloods, Crips or Shmira, acting like vigilantes,"" then-District Attorney Charles Hynes told a local Jewish newspaper.After learning he was wanted as a suspect, Shuchat fled to Israel through Canada amid claims he couldn't get a fair trial. He was indicted on the hate crime charges a few weeks later after prosecutors concluded bias was the only motive.The defense doesn't dispute that Shuchat had a run-in with Charles. But it says Shuchat was responding to a radio call reporting that two black men were throwing rocks and cursing at Jews. It also claims Charles wasn't harmed despite being taken to the hospital.""It was an argument between two people on the street,"" Batista said. ""There's nothing more to it.""Shuchat started a family in Israel before Brooklyn prosecutors sought his extradition. While he fought it, Crown Heights Jewish leaders circulated letters of support and started a defense fund.""Ytizy's young family does not deserve to be torn apart by a prosecution out to pander to rabble-rousers in the community,"" wrote the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council.Community activist Taharka Robinson, who's advising Charles' family, said Shuchat's decision to leave the country was telling.""I don't believe anyone would flee and go through Canada to get into Israel if they did not engage in an act that injured someone,"" he said.Shuchat's supporters see the extradition as an opportunity for vindication.""I'm glad he's back so things can be cleared up,"" Hikind said.

House GOP leaders Tuesday pitched a plan to fellow Republicans to counter an emerging Senate deal to reopen the government and forestall an economy-rattling default on U.S. obligations. But they stopped short of promising a vote later in the day after the plan got mixed reviews from the rank and file. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d1cb2100002501c963aa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The House approved a funding bill Friday evening to address a crisis of unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S. border illegally, sending the legislation to a Senate that is out of town and wouldn't consider it anyway -- and a president who has already promised a veto. The bill passed 223 to 189. One Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, joined Republicans voting for the bill, while four Republicans joined Democrats in opposition: Reps. Stephen Fincher of Tennessee, Paul Broun of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Walter Jones of North Carolina.House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement after the vote that it was ""a responsible bill to address the humanitarian crisis at our southern border."" He called on the Senate to approve it.""If President Obama needs these resources, he will urge Senate Democrats to put politics aside, come back to work, and approve our bill,"" Boehner said. ""There are also steps the president can take to address this crisis within the law, and without further legislative action. Every day the president and his party fail to act is another day this crisis continues.” The legislation is meant to address an influx of 57,500 unaccompanied minors who have been apprehended since October crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. President Barack Obama requested $3.7 billion in funds, which House members quickly ruled out. They first considered a $1.5 billion package, which shrunk to less than $1 billion, then to $659 million.It almost didn't get a vote at all. Republican House leaders pulled the bill from the schedule on Thursday, the last planned day before the August recess, because it didn't have the votes to pass. On Friday, the leadership returned with a reworked bill containing stricter provisions and $35 million in funding for states that send National Guard troops to the border on their own, putting the final price tag at $694 million. The bill received significant opposition from Democrats, who criticized provisions such as changing a 2008 law so unaccompanied minors from countries other than Mexico or Canada could be deported more quickly. Democrats also said sending the National Guard to the border was unnecessary, and the funding was far too little to address the crisis. Democratic opposition was strong even before the GOP made changes to toughen the bill, and was nearly unanimous by Friday evening. The House GOP's funding bill will be followed by a vote on a separate measure meant to attract support from Republican members who were previously wary of supporting the border crisis legislation. Members will vote later on Friday on whether to end a policy that protects undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children from being deported, and to prevent the president from taking further action to slow deportations.Obama has already dismissed the GOP's funding bill as ""extreme and unworkable,"" and said it's ""going nowhere."" The Democratic-led Senate already left for the August recess after its own border crisis funding bill failed on Thursday evening. ""They're not even trying to actually solve the problem,"" Obama said of House Republicans at a press conference earlier Friday. ""This is a message bill that they couldn't pull off yesterday, so they made it a little more extreme so maybe they can pass it today. Just so they can check a box before they're leaving town for a month.""This article has been updated with vote details and Boehner's comments. "

Israel has confirmed that 63 soldiers have died in combat, while Palestinian shelling has also killed three civilians in Israel.Netanyahu's comments came as Israel signaled it was taking action to withdraw on its own terms, saying it would not attend talks in Cairo this weekend aimed at achieving a new truce.In some areas of Gaza, witnesses saw Israeli tanks pulling back towards the border, while the Israeli military gave Palestinians who had fled one town the all-clear to return.Israel's main goal in its incursion into Gaza last month was to destroy Hamas's network of tunnels, and the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) said they were close to achieving that.More than 30 tunnels and dozens of access shafts have been unearthed and were being blown up, the military said.""Our understanding is that our objectives, most importantly the destruction of the tunnels, are close to completion,"" a military spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner, said.Netanyahu said in a televised speech that military action would continue even after that goal is achieved.""After completing the anti-tunnel operation, the IDF will act and continue to act, in accordance with our security needs and only according to our defense needs, until we achieve our objective of restoring security to you, Israel's citizens,"" he said.

Charles Schumer, D-New York, takes questions, Monday, April 28, 2014, in New York, after proposing a major retooling of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey with seven reforms he says are needed to address the organization's dysfunction and bring it back to its core mission of focusing on critical transportation infrastructure on long-term regional economic development. (AP Photo/Kathy Willens)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d1892100002501c9638c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DETROIT AND WASHINGTON -- They call him ""Wall Street Chuck"" on Capitol Hill. He has raised at least $70 million from the financial sector for the Democratic Party and showered the banking establishment with political aid for decades. He protected ultra-low tax rates for hedge fund managers and private equity kingpins, pressed to repeal the Glass-Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking, gutted a bill to regulate credit-rating agencies during the housing bubble, and even attacked the Securities and Exchange Commission's budget.But over the past eight years, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has also served as the accidental architect of the Senate bank reform caucus, the primary bulwark against a flood of bank deregulation bills passed in the House after the 2010 tea party wave.Schumer's early and persistent support for Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and, most prominently, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has created a core of Wall Street critics on the Senate Banking Committee -- a panel that has historically enjoyed a cozy relationship with banks. All three have proven to be effective legislators on financial issues and used their positions to broadcast populist critiques of the banking status quo. During an interview at the July Netroots Nation conference in Detroit, an event littered with activists hoping to draft Warren into a presidential run, Schumer is happy to detail his own influence on her rise.""I put the idea in her head of being senator,"" Schumer says. ""You should have seen the dinner. ... I said, 'You should run for Senate!' I remember the restaurant in downtown Washington. It was on 12th Street. She nearly fell off her seat!"" It turns out that Schumer can't actually remember the specific restaurant, but he recalls giving Warren a hard sell, making the case for her candidacy over three different meals before she agreed to test the campaign waters. The Senate has since transformed Warren from an influential academic into the hottest commodity in Democratic Party politics, lauded by progressives and courted by red-state Democrats for appearances at rallies and fundraisers. Her rhetoric is nothing like what the political class has come to expect from Schumer, whose biggest home-state industry is high finance.""Just look at the big banks,"" Warren said in her Netroots speech. ""They cheated American families, crashed the economy, got bailed out, and now the biggest banks are even bigger than they were in 2008. They still swagger through Washington, blocking reforms and pushing around agencies. A kid gets caught with a few ounces of pot and goes to jail, but a big bank launders drug money and no one gets arrested.""While Warren may be the nation's best-known bank reform advocate, Merkley and Brown have been just as effective as legislators. In his second year in office, Merkley co-authored the Volcker Rule, which bans banks from speculating in securities markets for their own accounts. Brown's bipartisan bill to dramatically curb the amount of risky debt that banks use to fund their operations hasn't passed Congress, but it put pressure on regulators, who eventually required big banks to raise an additional $68 billion in capital.The trio has been most effective, however, as a voting bloc within the Banking Committee, shaping or killing legislation, approving or rejecting critical Obama appointees and, perhaps most importantly, offering a bank reform seal of approval to the broader Democratic caucus. While members of Congress in general have become more financially literate since the 2008 crash, they still look to expert allies on the banking panel when determining how to vote -- a phenomenon former committee Chairman Chris Dodd detailed at a Bipartisan Policy Center event in July.""When I served on the Banking Committee for 30 years, when we would come to the floor of the Senate with as close to unanimity as possible ... all the question you'd get from your colleagues would be, 'Is it okay?'"" said Dodd, a former Democratic senator from Connecticut. ""And if the answer was, it was okay, you got their votes. Because you were going into areas that most members just don't have the vaguest idea what you're talking about.""And so the Senate, which is typically more corporate-friendly than the House, has become a surprising source of big bank skepticism. When President Barack Obama pushed to nominate chronic deregulator Larry Summers to be chairman of the Federal Reserve, Brown organized dozens of signatures from Democratic senators on a letter to the president suggesting Janet Yellen instead. The Summers nomination ultimately collapsed when Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) joined Brown, Merkley and Warren as opponents, making it impossible for the nomination to clear the Banking Committee.The three senators have been just as effective in stopping legislation. The House has repeatedly passed deregulatory bills chipping away at the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, only to see them die in the upper chamber. When asked if the bank reform activism of his acolytes irritates his friends on Wall Street, Schumer shrugs off the question.""Well, that's too bad! We should have a broad, diverse Democratic Party,"" Schumer says. ""You go to Wall Street; they think I don't defend them enough. You go to the left, and they think I defend them too much.""Indeed, Schumer has long had a troubled relationship with progressives. His prolific fundraising is the foundation of his political power, which frequently puts him at odds with the party's anti-corporate wing. When it comes to Senate recruiting for the Democratic Party, Schumer cares far more about a candidate's electability than about his or her exact policy views. In primary races, he has often supported conservative Democrats over more progressive alternatives. For example, Schumer protégé Kay Hagan, who eventually became a senator from North Carolina, has been a consistent bank-backer.Progressives were not happy about Schumer's effort to enlist Warren for the Senate either. Back in 2011, Warren had been agitating to be named the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency she conceived of and helped shepherd into existence during the negotiations over Dodd-Frank. But Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Obama adviser Summers were jockeying to torpedo her candidacy, and Schumer's recruitment was seen in many circles as an effort to appease the banks by taking her out of the CFPB running and thereby gutting the nascent agency before it got off the ground. Today, the CFPB is alive and well, having returned $4.6 billion to consumers over its first four years. Schumer says that Republicans had already doomed Warren's candidacy (they also attempted to block the eventual nominee, Richard Cordray) and that he had long admired Warren's academic work. ""She was the first person -- and this was brilliant -- to uncover that middle class incomes, median income was declining,"" Schumer says. ""To this moment, I consider the greatest crisis in America the decline of middle class incomes.""Liberal activists were just as frustrated with Schumer's earlier work in recruiting Brown and Merkley when Schumer chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2006 and 2008. In Brown's 2006 Senate race, Iraq war veteran Paul Hackett was the preferred candidate of the liberal blogosphere. Schumer infuriated many Ohio liberals by pressuring Hackett to back out of the race.Two years later, the affable Steve Novick was the choice of Oregon liberals, who liked his unusual biography and his work as lead litigator in the Love Canal environmental lawsuit. Schumer spent $300,000 on ads backing Merkley, a very large sum in a primary contest, which turned a double-digit Novick lead into a narrow Merkley win.Novick, now a Portland city commissioner, tells The Huffington Post that he harbors no ill will toward Schumer or Merkley, noting a graceful call he received from Schumer the day after the primary. ""But I definitely believe he cost me a Senate seat,"" Novick says. ""As a business model, it was really effective. They picked their guy early, and it sent a clear signal to all the donors. By the end of the primary, he was getting a ton of money from out of state. ... We just didn't have the money.""Schumer is aware of his reputation in the liberal blogosphere and has occasionally thrown his own barbs back. Last year, he told The New Republic that ""left-wing blogs"" were the ""mirror image"" of tea party sites, ""only with less credibility and less clout.""But the New York senator is trying to do more progressive outreach these days. He attended Netroots Nation this year for the first time, giving a speech about immigration reform. And he's quick to highlight his bank reform votes in the interview with HuffPost. Although he once supported the carried interest loophole that allows hedge fund and private equity managers to be taxed at low rates, he has since voted to close it. Since the meltdown, he has pushed to expand the SEC's budget and protect it from Congressional defunding. ""I call the shots as I see them,"" Schumer says. ""I supported the Volcker Rule and helped get it put in. In 2000, when Bill Clinton and Larry Summers wanted to loosen up derivatives, I opposed it.""He did, in fact, work to defang some of the worst elements of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. But the resulting legislation, which is widely blamed for the 2008 crash, still passed the Senate unanimously. Schumer can hold his own discussing high finance, yet his heart clearly isn't in it: His tone is flat, his eyes focused but dispassionate. His true love isn't Wall Street; it's the Democratic Party. And when the subject shifts to winning seats in Congress, he's a different man, exuberant with an almost childlike sense of glee at his party's 2016 prospects.""Their only two candidates who are not on the hard right are both wounded in one way or another,"" Schumer says, referring to Republicans. ""[New Jersey Gov. Chris] Christie, wounded by the bridge. [Former Florida Gov.] Jeb Bush, well, not wounded but who I don't think will run. Well, if they run any of their other candidates, my early prediction is that we'll carry the Senate, carry the House by significant amounts. President will carry almost all the states -- Hillary [Clinton] ... If [Texas Sen.] Ted Cruz becomes their nominee, we will carry 50 states, including Texas.""No word on how many states a Warren presidential ticket would carry.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article claimed that Sen. Schumer had raised ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" from the financial sector. Only $70 million has been documented by the Center for Responsive Politics, although much of his fundraising from the DSCC remains uncoded. This article has also been updated to include more detail on Sen. Schumer's current positions."

Lerner invoked her Fifth Amendment right not to testify.

Lerner, the official at heart of the scandal, wrote that some members of the GOP were ""crazies"" and ""assholes."" Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the messages showed Lerner's ""disgust with conservatives.""But according to copies of the emails leaked by Democrats, Lerner was writing to her husband, not to another IRS official. As the Post noted, federal employees are free to express political views in private conversations. They may not, however, promote candidates at work or use their position to influence the political process -- something that Republicans allege occurred at the IRS.The Daily Caller reported last year that Lerner's husband, Michael Miles, is an attorney whose law firm hosted a voter registration organizing event for President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign in 2012.This isn't the first time Lerner's emails have come under scrutiny. In June, congressional investigators released an exchange they hyped as the smoking gun: messages purporting to show that Lerner had sought an audit relating to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).
