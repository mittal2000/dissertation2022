When I was approximately 23, a simple utterance reminded me of this. The ire coldness of the air",2016-08-28,"A self-portrait of Vincent van Gogh, the famous painter who possibly suffered from vertigo, nausea, and tinnitus. This topic remains debated.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c32c041800002800bcd9ee.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Acts of speech hold power. When I was approximately 23, a simple utterance reminded me of this. The ire coldness of the air that carried it pierced me. And while the breath that carried it has long since dissipated, it emerged from me without its words.“Get used to it.”Funny, even anti-climactic, these words: this is because they are so simple, common, and unimaginative. Certainly, they can be insensitive. However, I never imagined what gravity they could wield. I never guessed that they could be so deleterious. At any rate, these were the words that an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist dryly imparted to me near the end of my consultation.Not long before this, I had begun to suffer from a cacophony of noises and ringing in my ears, and all over and within the inside of my head, without any clear precipitating event. Sometimes there were three, four, or five different tones, rumbles, or roars. My hearing had been faltering, which I had only discovered after attempting to enlist in the military, an action that resulted in me being rejected for my apparent deficits. Soon, I experienced dizziness and felt grossly overwhelmed, like I was alien in my own world. Phantom noises interrupted my sleep and triggered seizure-like bursts of adrenaline at random. Slowly but surely, my focus was slipping. Conversations became hard, tiresome. Words started to arrive to me as stones, devoid of meaning, heavy with force.I told the doctor all of this. He conducted tests. Outwardly I was mostly still and tense. Mildly sweaty, I continued to attempt stoicism, not wanting to show weakness. Emotion crept through wobbles and cracks in my voice as I answered his questions. He seemed to register this, and rather intellectually, but he remained indifferent.You are going to die from this. That was my thought in that moment. You have cancer, or a tumor, or something terrible. It’s obviously killing you.“You have sensorineural hearing loss. The ringing is called tinnitus,” he said, rather pragmatically, at the conclusion of his short investigation.“From what? Should I get an MRI or something?“No, that’s not necessary.”“What’s causing it?”He shrugged. “There is no way to know.”“What can I do?”And then those words arrived. “Get used to it.”Following this exchange, he offered me a prescription for an antidepressant with all the bearing of a lord offering a beggar some change. I refused it. Something was physically wrong with me, I remember thinking. I didn’t want a prescription. I wanted an answer, a cure. After explaining that I didn’t feel comfortable with an anti-depressant without knowing what was wrong with me, he simply shrugged. “See your primary care doctor if you change your mind. I don’t usually give these prescriptions anyway.” And with that, he promptly concluded the appointment.The physical sensation in that moment is indelibly impressed in my memory. I cannot explain it, but it was akin to nausea and vertiginous emptiness. I was moving downward while my body stayed still and my auditory sensations engaged in a riot.How could anyone live like this? I was slipping. No one can. I can’t do this.To be fair, I don’t necessarily blame the doctor for his manner. I was his last patient of the day. He didn’t know me. Fatigue greeted me from the puffiness of his face, from the caving of his shoulders. As someone who later joined a helping profession, I know that we all have these bad days. Still, the affects of his callousness and silence on my condition were palpable. He offered neither an explanation of my symptoms nor words of encouragement, no hope nor referral. He did not even offer me a follow up.Well, that’s it.Time passed. Thanksgiving came. Hunched inward, I ate quietly, mechanically, somehow not used to my hands amidst other people. My family was conversing and laughing. Meanwhile, I was pretending to be the young man they once knew. In that moment, I remember estimating that I would definitely not live to see 30 years of age. Suicidal ideation occurred daily; however, I did not think that I would be dead so soon because I had any intention of killing myself. Instead, I figured that the sheer amount of stress that I experienced on an almost moment-to-moment basis would accomplish this thoroughly, either by heart attack or stroke.And quite honestly, I did not mind the thought. There is no space here to properly explain my judgment, but I’ll try. Sensory deprivation and its consequences depress the mood and complicate every life challenge and developmental hurdle. Soon I was left without a relationship, without friends, and without hope. Bit by bit, I experienced my personality being deleted. I was not stimulated; I was still. Ruminated and ill. Who could live in those conditions?Well, I did, and against my will. I kept on breathing to my own chagrin.The journey was difficult. I had to fill the time. I had to distract my mind from the cacophony. So I wrote. Books, short stories, essays ― most of it terrible, obtuse, and didactic, and I knew this, but I wrote anyway. Loads of it was doggerel, but it served as life support for my imagination. Strangely, I became more spiritual and religious where I had previously been so staunchly unbelieving. I did not attend church. The thought of that overwhelmed me. Instead, I read a bit of Dostoevsky when I could focus, which made me love writing all the more. The man has been dead for over a century and his words helped save my life.I had to get up in the morning although my spirit felt dull and my heart and mind felt dire. When I wanted to numb and wither, I walked, or ran, or boxed. When my mind began to slip and there was no escape, for elusion is impossible when your enemy is your own anatomy, in place of meaningless suffering, of odious stillness, again I wrote stories and fairytales.I am thankful for my family and my few friends of this time period. I do not mean to convey that I did all of this on my own. They supported me in ways I cannot even cognize. They housed me, fed me, provided me with the invisible manifold of social support so crucial to anyone facing life challenges. They pushed me; they forced me to socialize. Never did they shame me, but they made me so angry, so irritable. And I love them for it.Soon enough, I enrolled in school. New friends arrived in bundles. Slowly, things improved, but not in any linear fashion. I would go to class, do my work, and socialize but I became known for ceaseless, misplaced smiles and endless head bobbles. Every moment of every conversation required conscious effort, inference, and risk. People always had to repeat themselves or I would make a mistake and slow down the flow of dialogue. Despite their best efforts, I would always notice their agitation, their tiredness of me. I was lost, alienated. My speech became pressured, insecure, rambling. Still, my head rang and I often staggered. Reclusion thus became more comfortable. I lived for years like this, without hearing aids.Why did I live without hearing aids for so long? Good question! Hearing aids are considered cosmetic in the United States and are not covered by most insurances. Decent ones cost in the thousands of dollars. This is unconscionable. Not only do they improve the quality of life, they are medically necessary. The more time you spend without hearing aids, the more your brain forgets how to process sound ― words ― social cues. Disability can soon pursue, precluding your ability to work and afford them, which, again, only hastens the decompensation.Finally, I obtained them, but only after I managed to rebuild my life to some major extent, with my family’s help and my own perseverance, and procure a job that allowed me to finance their purchase.Surprisingly enough, during this time, I also had to quest after my diagnosis and recovery plan. None of the litany of medical professionals I ever consulted with ever helped me find an answer until the last. In fact, only two years ago was I finally diagnosed with “cookie bite hearing loss,” a rare auditory condition that affects the processing of mid-frequency sounds, and educated on exercises to help preserve my balance. I’m supremely and inexpressibly thankful for this last doctor who cared enough to do a full workup and name my condition. A good mystery might be entertaining when it is found in a novel, but I can assure you, it is hardly fun when it is found in your health.Now, for the positives. Obviously, I have not died. Although, if I have, at least this would be rather exciting for paranormal enthusiasts. After all, that would mean that I was a revenant and solid proof of the existence of an afterlife. Perhaps this could also land me a role in a future Ghostbuster’s movie. Call me, Leslie Jones.Anyhow, all humor aside, I am 33 now. I smile a lot. I am neither ruined nor deleted and while I am indeed a different person, I am also a better one, emboldened in new ways and capable of loud and annoyingly boisterous laughter.I am a clinical social worker, having obtained my Master of Social Work. I have started my own business and I am involved in a nonprofit that seeks to enhance the quality and accountability of mental healthcare through evidence-based practice and quantitative methods. Presently, I spend much of my time being of service to individuals who are struggling with life changing illnesses, obstacles, or situations, helping them to recover and/or grow.Importantly, as deprived as I was, I am conscientious that I was fortunate to have access to the resources that I did. Paying this forward is an ethical mandate and I have a debt to remunerate. Innumerable individuals suffer from even more complicated forms of deprivation on top of mine, be it for reasons related to poverty, to institutional racism, or to so many other factors.Such injustices can transform a Kafkaesque horror story into a Lovecraftian nightmare. This is also why slogans such as “Black Lives Matter” are so important. I can’t imagine what my life would have been like if I was born into different circumstances. Perhaps I would not be alive.To this day, life isn’t perfect. I continue to lose my hearing. There is a marked probability that I will be legally deaf within a decade and a half. My dizziness, my nausea, are common companions. More and more, I find myself lost and aloof in the same social situations that I once enjoyed. Strangely, while I have forgotten what the experience of silence is like, I have at least trained myself not to be swallowed by the wormhole in my head, which can so readily estrange me and sap my sense of wellness.The loss is unutterable. The feeling of a personal death is real. I thought I was dead—and in many ways, more spiritually speaking, I was in part. There are many things I am not sharing. I am irrevocably different.However as long as you do not give up you will adapt and grow. You will be given opportunities to experience life again in ways you never imagined.Many days will temporarily block out the sun. Nonetheless, if this experience has taught me one important lesson, it is that regardless of the pain, regardless of the hopelessness, it is invariably ephemeral—it does pass, it does fade, and days of happiness and accomplishment follow.I can honestly say that I think I am happier than I ever would have been otherwise. Irrevocable difference is not irrevocable or universal loss. Again, the loss is indeed there, but the gains can also be just. So please, don’t give up. Now, I want to breathe. There will be life again.Although this article is about hearing loss and its associated conditions, I hope that the message is also helpful for individuals who are suffering from other life changing illnesses or situations. Moreover, many soldiers experience hearing loss, tinnitus, and other similar and/or related symptoms as a consequence of their service, in addition to the burdens of injury, trauma, and post-traumatic stress. I can never speak for them, but I still hope that a facet of my experience is of use.The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) is an institute that advocates for individuals experiencing communication-related disabilities and supports professionals and research in these areas.

Believe it or not, it didn’t feel difficult because",2016-08-28,"Monique Alvarez enjoying the streets of Guanajuato, Mexico.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c326fa1800002700bcd9e1.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After waiting 35 years to have kids, I had two babies in twelve months.Believe it or not, it didn’t feel difficult because it was what I wanted. My boys are now half way to their second and third birthdays and they already have stamps in their passports. They have been on their first plane ride, they are soaking up a second language, they are taking in a new culture and they are eating plenty of new offerings.Travel should happen after the kids have graduated and you’re ready to retire right?I recently read a mom post on Facebook about her plans of traveling the world. She said she would start the moment her two kids graduated from high school, and I get it. She’s got little ones. Some days the basics feel like adventure enough, if you know what I mean. Others say they will travel once they reach retirement. Once they’ve got a nest egg and investments working for them they will be financially ready to enjoy their life. The responsibilities of raising children will be behind them and they can really focus on their lives. But how often does this actually happen? How often does later turn into never?So why on earth would we choose to live abroad and travel now?Here is the straight and honest truth ― being committed to nurturing a marriage, caring for kids and running several businesses does make for a full plate, but those things are not enough to satisfy my soul fully. Living lean on possessions in order to be free to pick up and get on a plane to whatever place has caught our attention, now that lights me up! Plus it makes the other key pieces of my life much richer and fulfilling. When given the option to do what I love now or later, I always choose now. There are no guarantees. We often convince ourselves that there’s plenty of time or that the opportunity will always be there and that simply may not be true. Want the real truth on how hard it is to pull off?It’s not harder than living in the U.S. In fact, it’s loads easier. And the reason why lies in the culture in which we are living. Mexico is super family and kid-friendly. They could not be more patient and loving. They enjoy it when our kids run up to their table in a restaurant. When my kids are turning up the volume for no particular reason, they find it amusing and remind me to let them be kids. They take life at a slower pace so it’s quite alright that it takes two hours to eat breakfast and half an hour to walk a block. They don’t care about being stared at or have a strict rule of personal space. They see kids as a blessing. And don’t let me forget to mention that with a lower cost of living I only work three hours a day, so my children get loads of time with me to play, nap and cook. When my husband and I want to have a date night, we can easily afford to have a nanny come over for a few hours and we feel confident that our boys are being taken care of. As a mother there is no greater feeling than witnessing your children being loved on all the time.I’m a different mother while traveling.I’m less uptight and self-conscious when living abroad because I don’t feel the judgements and experience the darting eyes. Motherhood is no longer a competition. I’m not trying to measure up to anyone else’s standard of success. I am simply enjoying my kids. Interestingly enough, I am much more trusting, as well ― when my kid is on the other side of the park I can be certain that another mom will pick him up when he falls. I have a village here and it most definitely takes a village to raise kids well.And if I could give one piece of advice, one gypsy mama to another, start when they are young.The culture in which we are raised soaks into our bones so slowly and subtly it goes unnoticed until we enter a new one. If you want your family to be open-minded, accepting of every culture and people, if you want to cultivate curiosity and adventure, do not delay. There is a natural monotony of having little ones, so give them the balance of routine and new experiences. Make the plans, be courageous and leap!Here are my final three pieces of advice for parents who have a love affair with travel like I do:1. If travel is in your blood, make the move and be sure that your kids will adapt faster and better than you can.2. If you are happy living abroad, your kids will definitely pick up on it and embrace the experience, too.3. If you are committed to being their constant, the variety will serve them well - both now and later.Monique Alvarez is an adventurer and unconventional entrepreneur.

2,THE WORLDPOST,The Plight Of Myanmar’s Muslim Minority: The Genocide No One Is Talking About,"Nazir Harb Michel, ContributorPost-Doc Senior Researcher Fellow, Sociolinguist, Georgetown U...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-plight-of-myanmars-muslim-minority-the-genocide_us_57c35684e4b0b01630dfb7a0,The genocide no one is talking about.,2016-08-28,<p>Rohingya Muslim children wearing traditional Islamic headdresses</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c357ba1800002500bcda45.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"According to the United Nations, the Rohingya Muslims are the most persecuted minority in the world. Yet their tragic story is not often discussed. Amid the whirlwind of other breaking news events, persecution in Myanmar takes a backseat. So, who are these persecuted people? Why is this minority targeted, what exactly is happening to them, and what is being done to help?Who are the Rohingya Muslims?Muslims comprise 4% of Myanmar’s population of around 60 million. The country is 90% Buddhist. Of the 135 races that are recognized by the government of Myanmar, one, the Rohingya (or “Rakhine” in Burmese) is largely Muslim. Since 1982, however, the Rohingya have been considered stateless, undocumented immigrants - they have no citizenship and, since the passing of the Burmese Citizenship Law (Pyithu Hluttaw Law no. 4), no longer constitute an ethnic group. So when these people are attacked or blamed for bouts of instability, violence, or rioting, they are defenseless. Human rights groups, including the Organization of Islamic Countries, have been denied entry into the country. In 1991 and 1992, some 260,000 Rohingya Muslims fled to neighboring countries following human rights violations, including torture, rape, and summary executions carried out by the Burmese military. In 2012, following a spate of attacks by the majority Rakhine Buddhists, between 140-200,000 Rohingya became internally displaced. 2015 estimates show 86,000 fled to other Southeast Asian countries. With no papers, no sponsors, and no resettlement options, the UN classifies the Rohingya as “the most persecuted minorities in the world.”Why are the Rohingya being persecuted? While the 1982 Burmese Citizenship Law is largely to blame for the Rohingya’s statelessness and their lack of access to employment, education and even basic healthcare services as well as the confiscation of their property, the conflict has its origins in Myanmar’s colonial period in the 18th and 19th centuries. Many Rohingya began migrating from modern-day Bangladesh in the late 18th century, but in 1826 Britain annexed the part of Myanmar where most Rohingya Muslims live today. Rohingya remain there today as Britain’s takeover of the Arakan state encouraged mass migration of Bengali Muslims who would become laborers and administrators in the newly established colony. As a result of the influx, Burmese Buddhist peasants were internally displaced. It’s not difficult to understand then, why, in 1948, after Burma gained its independence from Britain, the government sought to rectify the plight of its displaced Buddhist population. However, this was no simple task. New generations of now-Burmese Muslims were born and raised in the country and so, in response to attempts to force them out, they attempted to declare their own independence. They failed. Tensions with the government escalated again in 1961 when the Rohingya tried their hand at secession once more and were put down. Recent political events, along with a historical narrative that blames the Rohingya victims rather than the British colonial forces, have unfortunately converged into a lethal dose of Islamophobia. What is being done to help?Not enough. In 2010 Myanmar transitioned from a military junta to a democracy but, during that period, its minority Muslim population faced unprecedented levels of violence. The newly-minted government allowed the self-styled “969 movement” led by a Buddhist monk named Wirathu to form (969 are numbers that refer to attributes of the Buddha). Wirathu had been imprisoned by the ruling military junta for violence against Muslims. He calls himself “the Burmese bin Laden”. The group is supported by present-day senior leadership in the government, including the army’s former lieutenant general and current minister of religious affairs, Sann Sint, as well as other Buddhist monks and members of the National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of Nobel peace laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi. 969 believes in the “moral justification… of anti-Muslim bloodshed” and encourages the boycotting of Muslim-owned businesses; it also opposes interfaith marriages and regards mosques as “enemy bases”.In 2015, Myo Win, a member of the Burmese Muslim Association compared 969 to the KKK and argued that the group is backed by the government. Despite numerous deadly attacks on Rohingya Muslims by 969, the current government, and Suu Kyi herself, have refused to recognize what Desmond Tutu has termed “the slow genocide”. In an interview with Today’s Mishal Husain, Suu Kyi seemed exasperated by repeated questions about Human Rights Watch reports that identified Arakan’s extremist Buddhist 969 movement as responsible for the systematic persecution and ethnic cleansing of Muslims. Suu Kyi dismissed the possibility of extending government aid to the targeted Muslim population and attempted to change the subject by instead citing the need to create security and stability for all — not unlike the ‘all lives matter’ tack in the United States. After the interview’s abrupt end, Suu Kyi was caught on microphone saying, “No-one told me I was going to be interviewed by a Muslim”. Her comments shocked many and prompted questions about her true commitment to human rights and democracy in Myanmar. Her biographer, Peter Popham, was quick to point out, however, that Suu Kyi had had a Muslim Pakistani boyfriend while a student at Oxford and that she was inspired to join the struggle to democratize Burma by a Muslim journalist named Maung Thaw Ka. Still, as the fate of the Rohingya Muslims hangs in the balance, some important questions remain.Is the worst behind us?There have been some improvements under Suu Kyi’s NLD-led government but some 1.2 million Rohingya remained internally displaced and are still denied basic rights and freedoms. The leaders of the violent 969 group continue their pogrom-like attacks against the Rohingya with impunity. They incite hate and violence against the Muslim minority by fabricating conspiracy theories about “a jihad threat” and Muslim drug dealers doping Buddhist youth and convincing them to take up arms against the government. Like Islamophobic fear-mongers in the United States and Europe, 969’s discourse is replete with references to Huntington’s ‘clash of civilizations’ doctrine. So brazen is 969’s Islamophobic rhetoric that The Daily Show’s November 2015 spoof - “The Myanmar Daily Show with Trevor Noah” - included an interview with Wirathu wherein he compares Muslims to “mad dogs” and, when asked if Muslims have a place in the country, replied coldly: “Muslims were [expletive meaning defecating] on Burma”.Stop scapegoating Muslims Suu Kyi’s government must recognize the Rohingya as citizens with full and equal rights. The Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar are not to blame for the migration policies of 19th century colonial Britain. The 969 movement must be dismantled, its leadership acknowledged as militants who have committed crimes against humanity, and those crimes must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of both national and international law. Islamophobia is racism. Anti-Muslim sentiment and violence are no lesser offenses than anti-Semitism or other forms of racism. The existence of monstrous, contemptible terrorist organizations like ISIS and Al-Qaeda who claim Muslim identity or to have some sort of Islamic license to legitimize their heinous actions, does not justify harassment, hatred, threats against, violence to, occupation, internment, ethnic cleansing or genocide of ordinary Muslims in Myanmar or anywhere else in the world. Muslim lives are human lives too. Islamophobia kills because it does not differentiate between the acts of a handful of terrorists and the 1.6 billion Muslims in the world who lead peaceful, normal lives and who are just as weary of terrorism, if not more so, as everyone else.

4,POLITICS,Someone Using The Email Address Of Trump's Doctor Demanded Money For An Interview,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-doctor_us_57c2f2a1e4b0267344507f50,"“325 per hour in advance.""",2016-08-28,HuffPost's initial inquiry to Harold Bornstein's email address.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c2f4041800002100bcd997.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Someone using an email address connected to Harold Bornstein, Donald Trump’s doctor, apparently doesn’t want to miss out on the opportunity to cash in on the GOP presidential nominee’s campaign.Bornstein wrote a letter in December saying Trump would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” The doctor told NBC News on Friday that he had written the letter in five minutes while a limo waited outside.A Huffington Post reader pointed out that the letter mentioned a website that wasn’t actually registered until several months after the endorsement of Trump’s health was written, so I sent an email on Saturday afternoon to the Gmail address listed in the letter’s header. Someone replied from the address a little after 1 a.m. on Sunday, saying he or she wanted money to talk. “325 per hour in advance,” the person wrote.I asked the person to confirm that they were in fact Trump’s doctor. HuffPost would not pay for an interview, I wrote, but would this person still be willing to answer some questions? The response was curt: “No.”Was he or she declining to do an interview, or were saying they weren’t Trump’s doctor? “Yes, no,” the person wrote back.I was still confused, so I phrased the question more directly: “You are Mr. Trump’s doctor and wrote the letter attesting to his health, correct?”“No interview, senza soldi,” the person wrote back, using an Italian phrase that means “without money.” “Are you Donald Trump’s doctor. Yes or no?” I asked.“Quanti soldi?” the person wrote back, which means “how much money?” in Italian. A follow-up question was also answered in Italian, and also referenced money. Finally, I asked why the person was writing to me in Italian. I didn’t receive a response.Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the exchange.Gizmodo reported on Friday that a photo of Bornstein appears to show that he uses Windows XP, an outdated operating system that could make a computer less secure. Not using an up-to-date operating system may violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, according to the outlet. Jennifer Gunter, an OB/GYN, wrote in a HuffPost blog post earlier this month that it was unusual for a doctor to list a Gmail address on a professional letter because the email service is not a secure method of communication.Both Trump and Hillary Clinton ― the two oldest candidates to face off against each other in a presidential election ― have released limited data about their health. Trump and his surrogates have peddled the suggestion, unsubstantiated by evidence, that Clinton is concealing something about her health.UPDATE, Aug. 30 ― The Huffington Post was referred to the Trump campaign when it contacted Bornstein’s office multiple times to find out if the doctor speaks Italian. One of Bornstein’s online biographies lists him as fluent in Italian. The person using Bornstein’s email address denied that a Twitter account with several tweets in Italian belonged to him. A GoFundMe campaign to raise money to interview the person using Bornstein’s account has raised just $20 so far.

Quinones Miller, ContributorJournalist, Best-Selling Author, Activist, An All-around Angry...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emmett-till-61-years-later-lets-keep-pretending_us_57c335cce4b00c54015e6022,"Emmett Till was killed before he could marry or have children, but writer Bernice McFadden ― author of 14 books including",2016-08-28,"Roy Bryant, one of two men charged with the kidnapping and lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till of Chicago, sits in court on the opening day of the trial.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c473cb1600003503bff2bb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Note: This post contains graphic images which may be upsetting for some readers.It was 61 years ago this past weekend ― on August 28, 1955 ― that two white men, carrying guns, pulled 14-year-old Emmett Till out of his grandparents’ home in Money, Mississippi.The teenager’s body was discovered in the Tallahatchie River three days later.It was revealed that he had been severely beaten, his eye had been gouged out, and he had been shot in the head; then a 70-pound cotton gin fan was attached to his neck by barb wire and his body was thrown in the river.The two men ― Roy Bryant and J. W. Milam ― who had pulled him out of the house were charged with kidnapping and murder. The defendants were allowed to sit with their families, even bouncing toddlers on their lap while testimony was being given.It took the all-white jury just one hour and seven minutes to find the men not guilty. One juror later said they would have come back with the verdict sooner if they had not stopped to get a pop; they wanted to stretch it out in order to make it look good.One year later, both men admitted their guilt in a Look Magazine interview. Milam told the writer, William Bradford Huie, that their intentions were just to scare Till. Push him around a little, pistol whip him, and then let him go. But, Milam, said, Till took the whipping but remained unrepentant ― even told his persecutors that he was unafraid of them, and that he was just as good as them.“Well, what else could we do? He was hopeless. I’m no bully; I never hurt a nigger in my life. I like niggers ― in their place ― I know how to work ‘em. But I just decided it was time a few people got put on notice. As long as I live and can do anything about it, niggers are gonna stay in their place.”So Roy Bryant and J. W. Milam happily committed kidnapping, torture, and murder and got away with it.Emmett Till, on the other hand, was murdered for the crime of... oh, that’s right, I didn’t say . . .His alleged crime, was whistling at a white woman ― Carolyn Bryant, the wife of Till’s murderer Roy Bryant.Emmett Till was killed before he could marry or have children, but writer Bernice McFadden ― author of 14 books including “Gathering of Waters,” a novel based on Till’s tragic demise ― maintains that he still has a long line of descendants. Not necessarily related to him by a shared bloodline, she explains, but descendants nonetheless. “His descendants are the hundreds of Black men and women who’ve had their lives taken by racist civilians and police officers in the sixty-one years since Emmett Till was murdered,” says McFadden, seen in the above video discussing “Gathering of Waters” ― which made The New York Times 100 Notable Books list ― at the Center for Fiction in New York.Oh, let me assure you there was an outcry from the African-American community about Emmett Till’s lynching, of course. We’re soooo good at public outcries.Don’t you think? But, hmm, I wonder why rapper Lil Wayne felt so comfortable using Emmett Till’s name in a most vulgar way in a guest verse on fellow rapper Future’s 2013 song, Karate Chop. In the verse, which was pulled from the song by Epic Records before it went on sale in retail stores, Lil Wayne raps about his sexual prowess, and him “beating that pussy up like Emmett Till.” Oh, of course he apologized ― a couple of weeks after there was a public outcry (there we go again!), but would he even have done it if we were really serious about we’ll never forget?OK, let me bring up some sore points.Remember 17-year-old Trayvon Martin? You should. He was killed in 2012, not some sixty years ago. He didn’t do anything as awful as whistling at a white woman. All he did was wear a hoodie in the rain while walking home after buying a package of Skittles.His killer was identified, and was acquitted.Yeah, public outcry. HUGE public outcry. And yet, just a year later there was Tamir Rice. Wow, he was even younger than Till ― only 12-years-old! Shot by a Cleveland police officer while holding a toy gun. Thankfully his murderer was put on trial, found guilty and locked up. Oh, wait a minute, he wasn’t. “The point of remembering is to remind ourselves we don’t live in a colorblind society,” Sharlia Lebreton Gulley, a friend of my daughter, told me in a recent conversation.To forget, continued Gulley ― a 27-year old postgraduate candidate at Florida International University ― is to run the risk “of drinking the kool-aid,” and pretending the murder of Tamir Rice had nothing to do with race. “We’d starting thinking we really do have equal opportunities, and that black lives actually matter.” I don’t know... but it seems that we really have that a great track record when it comes to remembering. The murders stay in the media, and in our minds for a few weeks, a few months ― and now, perhaps because of the Black Lives Matter movement, maybe even a few years. But only a few years ― if that much.When the Lil Wayne verse controversy occurred in 2013, I talked to about 20 people under the age of 30, but only seven of them knew who Emmett Till was, and, of those, only three thought it was a big deal that Lil Wayne associated his horrific death with sexual encounters. Ironic, because Mamie Till Bradley, the murdered teenager’s mother, insisted on having an open-casket funeral, so that people around the country could see what the murderers had done to their son. Photos of his body were printed in African-American newspapers around the country, as well as in Ebony and Jet Magazine. But you know how it is. After a while, we just forget.Like we forgot about Jesse Washington, a 17-year-old lynched in Waco, Texas in 1916 after being found guilty of murdering a white woman ― though some have questioned the authenticity of his confession. After the verdict was announced, a white mob of more than 500 men dragged him through the streets, and cut off his testicles before tying him to a tree. They then lowered him over a bonfire, and then raised him back up, only to lower him again.They did this for two hours, while a crowd of about 15,000 cheered... though not quite loud enough to drown out Washington’s screams.Lowering and raising him over the dancing flames. Lowering and raising him until his Black body was charcoal, and the screaming finally stopped. It took two hours for the screaming to stop.And there were photographs! Some even made into postcards and sold as souvenirs. An outraged W.E.B. Du Bois led the outcry (yes, even 100 years ago we were out crying. Oh! Uh, I mean, outcrying.), and ran the photographs in the Crisis Magazine, and like the Emmett Till lynching, the story and picture was picked up by newspapers around the country. But, yeah, the 100-year anniversary of Mr. Washington’s lynching was just a few months ago, but it barely received a mention in either mainstream or social media. Even though the photograph is one of the most well-known lynching photos in American history. Here it is. You’ve seen it before, haven’t you? I thought so. So, yeah, we remember the photograph, but not the person killed who we keep vowing we’ll never forget. I don’t know... is that our memories are really that bad? Oh, maybe, it takes more than a long memory to bring about change?"

I have actually contacted some of these clowns to ask them which Best-Seller lists their self-published books graced and - even though Amazon has more categories than the Academy Awards on steroids - I have obviously never received a response.(Truth be told, one of my DVDs was the number #1 best-seller in its category on Amazon for a week a few years ago - so I sparingly use the phrase ""best-seller"" regarding the DVD because... ah... it's accurate - accurate, that is, if you believe that the universe is curved and truth is thus somewhat elastic.) Two buddies from university who became agents told me how they hacked the New York Times Best-Sellers' lists for their celebrity clients' (sub-par) books. If you think that our government is rigged, just ask a publicist how much it will cost you to get on the NY Times Best-Seller list for a week - then you will understand what the word ""rigged"" really means.Humility?Decency?Honesty?Authenticity?When people are constantly legitimizing themselves by fabricating their own biographies on the Internet and their self-published book jackets, these concepts seem to be from a parallel universe.People of whom I have never heard spam me hawking their wares and claiming that they are ""World-Renowned"" at their particular service (as legitimized by their self-published book).

Enjoying the campfire with drums in the distance. Who can ask for more this very blessed night."" ~~An Elder at the Standing Rock Main Camp, Cannon Ball ND Smells of sweet burning sage linger in the late evening and drift over the main camp on Highway 1806 at Cannon Ball North Dakota. Junior Cuero of the San Diego Campo Reservation chants the Bird Song, a mesmerizing, meditative and repetitive song of respect and honor to the Standing Rock people. A gourd rattle accompanies this ancient chant; a message given to the people by the Creator. Creator sent a bird to teach the People how to sing and dance and treat each other with empathy and not indifference. The sun is setting, bathing the campsite in warm light as the prairie winds begin to calm, and people gather around the campfire, feet tapping in rhythm.There are two camps. One is located within the ""official"" reservation boundary and the second ""main camp"" with the majority of the protesters is located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineer's land just north of the Cannon Ball River. The North Dakota Department of Emergency Services says it is not on tribal property, but the original treaty line was moved in 1889, so if you support broken treaties, you could call it illegal. In this case legality is in the eye of the beholder. The Dawes Act and the Allotment Act opened the reservations throughout the United States to settlement by non-Indians. The tribe maintains jurisdiction on all reservation lands, ""including rights-of-way, waterways, and streams running through the reservation."" On paper, that is. See the history of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and learn more about the broken Fort Laramie Treaty that arbitrarily moved boundaries and tried to divide the Sioux Nation.Standing Rock lies just south of the pipeline's path under the Missouri River. How do you stop an oil spill at a boundary drawn on a map? Ask the people of Saskatchewan, who are facing 66,000 gallons of heavy crude from a broken pipeline owned by Husky Energy, Inc. It is making its way downstream and threatening the drinking water of several communities. Despite local media accounts to the contrary, this gathering of Nations to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline are Spirit Camps of thoughtful prayer. There is no need to prolong the misinformation and outright lies perpetuated by the North Dakota Forum News Service. A governor steeped in the sticky flow of oil and money that has all but ruined portions of the North Dakota landscape feeds the news cycle with threats and lies about behavior at the encampments and issues emergency orders. Truth about what fuels the reactions of authorities can be found in the discarded detritus of the failed oil boom. Abandoned RVs form small mountains in salvage yards, wells are shut down, man camps are ghost towns, and the promises of great wealth are only memory. The loss of oil revenue dollars provokes great fear in the offices of politicians. The Dakota Access Pipeline is really another name for the ""abandoned"" Keystone XL Pipeline and the goal is to wring every last drop of Bakken crude from North Dakota. Authorities are reacting with anxiety that the pipeline will be compromised, and believe that concrete barricades along the main road to Standing Rock will stop the people from coming to protect their life source; water flowing from the mighty Missouri river. But people continue to come, taking the long detour meant to complicate their journey to the Spirit Camp and reduce business at the Prairie Knights Casino and Hotel. But the authorities, despite the show of force at a ""safety checkpoint"" and rerouting of traffic on 1806 from Bismarck to Standing Rock, have failed. The hotel is almost full and the diversion along Highway 6 is spectacularly beautiful. Those who have purpose and appreciate the land and all it has to offer do not mind this ""detour.""Descendants of the Massacre at Wounded Knee by the Seventh Cavalry come. Young riders, many teenagers, come on their horses--they are some of the Big Foot Riders who travel 300 miles every year to Wounded Knee to pay respect to the ancestors who were massacred by the U.S. 7th Calvary Regiment. They, along with tribes from across the continent, do not want this pipeline that would involve 200 water crossings and pass through 300 sacred sites. They come. They come by car. They come by horse. They come on foot.They are still coming.Read Winona LaDuke's excellent analysis of all that is at stake, ""What Would Sitting Bull Do?""  I am not sure how badly North Dakota wants this pipeline. If there is to be a battle over the pipeline, it will be here. For a people with nothing else but a land and a river, I would not bet against them. The great Lakota leader Mathew King once said, "" the only thing sadder than an Indian who is not free, is an Indian who does not remember what it is to be free."" Let's for a moment reject the profane response of North Dakota authorities and focus instead on the sacred. So many have traveled great distances to stand in solidarity. Many Nations now united as one. An Elder from the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe talks of raising his granddaughter in the old ways. Seeing the tipis fills him with ""cante waste""-- ""heart felt good."" M. Jay Cook is a member of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) School Board and says that sometimes raising his granddaughter ""is my only motivation to live."" I receive a text from him one morning and a photo that is incredibly evocative of what is at stake here. He writes of the campfires and ""hearing memories of growing up in iron lightning"" as the stars speak to him of days gone by. He intends to ""face the storm (oil) like the Tatanka (Buffalo) Nation."" Hazel Red Bird is 91 years old and a regal presence around the campfire. Many stop to greet her and share stories of growing up in Fort Yates. Red Bird is now back home at Standing Rock after living a good part of her life in Wisconsin. She is a true warrior woman, having enlisted in the Army Air Corps during World War II to train as a nurse at St. Mary's School of Nursing in Pierre, South Dakota. The Great War ended just as her training did, and she began her working life as a registered nurse in the civilian white world. Red Bird surveys the gathering and says she is ""amazed, thankful and humbled."" Then she glances down at the writer's notepad to make certain those three words are written accurately. ""I am amazed because I didn't think I would live long enough to witness this unity and resiliency among the Nations.""Red Bird is quiet for a moment as her eyes narrow and she surveys the movement of the people who have gathered around the green tent that serves as a food and information center.""I am thankful that I have lived 91 winters and humbled that prayers have been answered.""At 91, this elegant Lakota woman still projects a warrior's stance. There is more to learn about this fascinating woman who is also a repository of the Lakota language, and you can read more here.There are other spiritual warriors who have gathered in joyful celebration and unity. Several young women from the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe wanted to make it very clear that they ""are standing for our water."" Their ancestors fought and died along the northern and eastern shores of the Missouri River.  The Crow Creek Indian Reservation was established by executive order following what was known as the Minnesota Uprising, as a prison camp for the exiled Isanti Dakota and Winnebago people. These were the survivors, mostly women and children, of the largest known public execution in American History, ""The Hanging of 38 Dakota Men at Mankato Minnesota."" From 1863 to 1866 approximately 300 died at Fort Thompson suffering from starvation, sickness, disease, exposure, hardship, and heartache.A federal judge will rule on the legality of the Dakota Access Pipeline on September 9. It remains to be seen whether the traumatic past will be repeated and define the present. How much can be endured; how much more can be stolen? This is a spiritual battle for generations to come. Clean water and air is a right, not an option.The bird song says this is true."

I told the hundreds of thousands of people in Washington that day, ""We do not want to go to jail. But we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for love, brotherhood, and true peace.""Fifty-three years later, the right to vote is still the most powerful nonviolent tool of transformation we have in our society. In 2016, we must use it to elect Hillary Clinton as our next president.In this election, we've seen old, rejected ideas of division and hatred rear their ugly heads. We've seen aspirational immigrants called criminals and rapists. We've heard hardworking young African-Americans smeared as violent. We've even seen insults hurled at the Gold Star parents of a young Muslim American who gave his life in service to our country.We can now clearly understand that there are forces in this country that want to take us back. We don't want to go back. We want to move this country forward.So we must vote in this election like we have never voted before.In 1965, when the March on Washington and even the Civil Rights Act still didn't bring the right to vote to all Americans, the Reverend Hosea Williams and I set out to lead a march from Selma to Montgomery on a day that would come to be known as ""Bloody Sunday.""At that time, African-Americans were made to take a so-called ""literacy test"" before we were permitted to register to vote. Some people were asked to count the number of bubbles on a bar of soap or the number of jelly beans in a jar. Black lawyers, doctors, and college professors were publicly humiliated and told they failed the test.

Why, in the face of such violence, did I keep marching forward?The only answer I know is that in my mind, that day, we didn't have a choice.

We've made tremendous progress, but there are those who still try to turn us back. To strip down our rights, to deny us our dignity, and turn us against each other. But I know we won't let them. We must keep marching forward.We march for all our brothers and sisters to be judged not by the place of our birth, the color of our skin, or the faith we practice, but by the content of our characters. We march for the black men and women who've lost their lives to gun violence and police violence -- and we march for the police officers who kiss their children goodbye knowing they might never come home. We march for 26 people at an elementary school in Newtown, and we march for 49 people celebrating their pride at a club in Orlando. We march for a brave young Army captain named Humayun Khan whose parents would not keep their silence.I bled for Dr. King's dream. He gave his life for it. We're not going to let anyone rip away our progress.We knew on that bridge in Selma that we were staring down a pivotal moment in history.

I believe that Hillary will work to take our country to another place, a better place. That's why I choose to fight with her. But I learned in Selma that you can't win these fights alone.

Café-restaurant (left) and studio (right) at ""Chaplin's World"" (Abu-Fadil)The house is filled with family pictures, memorabilia, scripts, music scores, magazines featuring the star, furniture, newspaper clippings, wax figures of Chaplin, Oona, and others whose paths he crossed, created by the Paris Grévin wax museum artists, as well as steamer trunks in a room chronicling his worldwide travels. Picture of Charlie and Oona Chaplin (Abu-Fadil)In one room there's a photo gallery of famous figures he knew. He paid special tribute to world-renowned scientist Albert Einstein.I will try and give you an impression of this great man. The eyes have a look as though they see clearly the simplicity of all things. The brow wears no furrows. One feels that all the superficial entanglements of thought that obscure our vision have been swept aside by him, and that he sees only the fundamentals Chaplin on Albert Einstein (Abu-Fadil)Every room has at least one screen projecting videos of home movies, clips from his professional films, and more. The studio is chock full of interactive multimedia installations recreating scenes from Chaplin's films, countless reels of movies, film strips, scripts, editing machines, and awards he received for his achievements in the movie industry. Countless film reels and scripts (Abu-Fadil)Charles Spencer Chaplin was born in London in 1889 and began his career as a comedian with a troupe that later toured the U.S. from 1910 to 1912. He returned to America, began his quick rise to fame in films and established a loyal fan base.He traveled extensively in the following two decades and realized his growing popularity, later declaring: ""I am a citizen of the world."" Room chronicling Chaplin's worldwide travels (Abu-Fadil)But with fame came infamy, triggered by an FBI witch-hunt, several lawsuits, attacks in the media and boycotts of his films which detractors saw as vehicles to promote anti-American and pro-""Red"" ideas in a charged xenophobic, conspiracy-minded environment egged on by the likes of communist-baiting Senator Joseph McCarthy.  Noted figures in Chaplin's life (Abu-Fadil)Chaplin fervently denied the charges. In one movie sequence the actor is seen asking a school lad engrossed in a book what he had been reading. The boy said Karl Marx, to which Chaplin's character asked if the boy was a communist. When reading Karl Marx is a liability (Abu-Fadil)The boy's retort: ""Must one be a communist to read Karl Marx?""Chaplin had lived in the U.S. for about 40 years but remained a British citizen. As he sailed with his family from New York to attend the premiere of his film Limelight in London, he got word he'd become persona non grata amid fears of Soviet penetration in America. Scene from ""The Immigrant"" (Abu-Fadil)A Norwalk, Ohio newspaper headlined on September 20, 1952: ""Charlie Chaplin Barred from U.S.""The estate's studio is fascinating for movie buffs. Scene from ""The Great Dictator"" (Abu-Fadil)After viewing a brief documentary on Chaplin in a theater, visitors walk behind the lifting movie screen into a replica of a street, through a 360-degree circus-like hall, along a corridor with statues of comedians Laurel and Hardy, pop star Michael Jackson, pictures, posters of his films, and videos, then down a steep staircase to a mock Hollywood studio with scenes from different movies. Oscars, a testament to Chaplin's talent and genius (Abu-Fadil)A plaque says Jackson idolized Chaplin: ""[He] was everything that I want to be - songwriter, dancer, director, producer."" Jackson dressed as The Tramp for a photo shoot on one of the London streets where Chaplin had lived, visited Oona, and later the families of Michael and Eugene Chaplin, in Corsier. In 1995, he recorded his favorite Chaplin song Smile for the HIStory album. Many say that Chaplin's dance during the ""Nonsense"" song at the end of Modern Times was one of the inspirations for Jackson's Moonwalk.  Queen Elizabeth II knights Chaplin in 1975 (Abu-Fadil)The anti-war Chaplin was given an award by the World Peace Council in 1965, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975, and honored with Oscars and the Lion d'Or of the Venice Film Festival."

One feels that all the superficial entanglements of thought that obscure our vision have been swept aside by him, and that he sees only the fundamentals Chaplin on Albert Einstein (Abu-Fadil)Every room has at least one screen projecting videos of home movies, clips from his professional films, and more. The studio is chock full of interactive multimedia installations recreating scenes from Chaplin's films, countless reels of movies, film strips, scripts, editing machines, and awards he received for his achievements in the movie industry. Countless film reels and scripts (Abu-Fadil)Charles Spencer Chaplin was born in London in 1889 and began his career as a comedian with a troupe that later toured the U.S. from 1910 to 1912. He returned to America, began his quick rise to fame in films and established a loyal fan base.He traveled extensively in the following two decades and realized his growing popularity, later declaring: ""I am a citizen of the world."" Room chronicling Chaplin's worldwide travels (Abu-Fadil)But with fame came infamy, triggered by an FBI witch-hunt, several lawsuits, attacks in the media and boycotts of his films which detractors saw as vehicles to promote anti-American and pro-""Red"" ideas in a charged xenophobic, conspiracy-minded environment egged on by the likes of communist-baiting Senator Joseph McCarthy.  Noted figures in Chaplin's life (Abu-Fadil)Chaplin fervently denied the charges. In one movie sequence the actor is seen asking a school lad engrossed in a book what he had been reading. The boy said Karl Marx, to which Chaplin's character asked if the boy was a communist. When reading Karl Marx is a liability (Abu-Fadil)The boy's retort: ""Must one be a communist to read Karl Marx?""Chaplin had lived in the U.S. for about 40 years but remained a British citizen. As he sailed with his family from New York to attend the premiere of his film Limelight in London, he got word he'd become persona non grata amid fears of Soviet penetration in America.

Scene from ""The Great Dictator"" (Abu-Fadil)After viewing a brief documentary on Chaplin in a theater, visitors walk behind the lifting movie screen into a replica of a street, through a 360-degree circus-like hall, along a corridor with statues of comedians Laurel and Hardy, pop star Michael Jackson, pictures, posters of his films, and videos, then down a steep staircase to a mock Hollywood studio with scenes from different movies. Oscars, a testament to Chaplin's talent and genius (Abu-Fadil)A plaque says Jackson idolized Chaplin: ""[He] was everything that I want to be - songwriter, dancer, director, producer."" Jackson dressed as The Tramp for a photo shoot on one of the London streets where Chaplin had lived, visited Oona, and later the families of Michael and Eugene Chaplin, in Corsier. In 1995, he recorded his favorite Chaplin song Smile for the HIStory album. Many say that Chaplin's dance during the ""Nonsense"" song at the end of Modern Times was one of the inspirations for Jackson's Moonwalk.  Queen Elizabeth II knights Chaplin in 1975 (Abu-Fadil)The anti-war Chaplin was given an award by the World Peace Council in 1965, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975, and honored with Oscars and the Lion d'Or of the Venice Film Festival."

The murder case triggered debate on misogyny in Korea, as the crime was motivated for the murderer's hatred towards women.] AsiaToday reporter Lee Mi-hyun - The term ""misogyny"" has been bandied around in the newspapers, TV, and everyday conversations quite often since earlier this year in South Korea.Misogyny has been often covered by newspapers along with heavy issues, such as radical Korean feminist community Megalia, Gangnam murder case, Nexon's replacement of voice actress, and more. We wondered what would Koreans think about misogyny in reality, not on the Internet. So we asked four ordinary Korean men and women about their thoughts on misogyny. Foreigners also gave their thoughts, too. First question. Does misogyny exist in South Korea? Interviewee A. ※ age/ sex/ occupation/ opinion ▷ 30 years old/ Female/ Nurse/ No, misogyny doesn't exist. - Misogyny doesn't exist. I think some of minorities made the term 'misogyny' to highlight some women's shortcomings. I've heard a lot people saying ""women are such and such"" and ""men are such and such."" Considering the fact that the book ""Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus"" became a big hit, I can tell that men and women are mostly different.Interviewee B. ▷28 years old/ Male/ Civil servant/ No, it doesn't. - I believe that 'gender war' frame has been excessively reported online rather than the fact that misogyny actually exists. I've never seen any men around me with misogynistic mind. However, there are many people who think that men experience more unfair treatment than women when it comes to relationship, due to conventional way of thinking that man should generally win favor with woman.Considering gender inequality and women's marriage delaying, Korea's marriage rate will continue to fall while dissatisfaction rate of those men with relatively higher desire of getting married will continue. I'm concerned that such dissatisfaction of men could be expressed into misogyny. Interviewee C. ▷29 years old/ Female/ Office worker/ Yes, misogyny exists. - I think misogyny exists in Korea. Of course, there is nobody around me who leaves such misogynistic comments online. But sometimes I see some men, who are usually very nice and smart, have misogynistic minds without any intentions.  Depending on your gender, people make different judgments of the same action. Besides, there are some specific attitudes and characteristics required only to women. In this context, many misogynistic terms, including 'Kimyeosa' and 'doenjangnyeo', have been created. Kimyeosa is used to describe a Korean woman with poor driving skills. Deonjangnyeo is used to describe a Korean woman who spends too much money on luxury products compared to their income. By contrast, there are no terms for men who do the same actions as mentioned above. There are used seldom, if ever. For instance, there are many men who would often drink expensive coffee at café. But nobody would blame them for doing so. Besides, car accident rates are lower for women drivers than men drivers. (Reporter's note: A study showed that last year's car crash rate was 0.34 per 100 women drivers and 1 per 100 men drivers.)A few years ago, there were rumors spreading online that voting rate of women in their 20s accounted for only 8%. Since then, I've seen many comments saying that young women these days are pathetic. Then people start to use problematic words that are used in a gender negative way for women, and those words become frequently used ones. Then both men and women start to use them without realizing the problem. I think this frame itself is misogyny. No one thinks it's strange because everyone is familiar with it. There is an online culture where netizens make a sweeping criticism towards women in general claiming that women are extravagant while men work hard to collect money to get married. There is also an online culture where netizens would look at a picture of an ordinary woman and evaluate how beautiful she is. Of course, I hear this kind of conversation in real life as well. At my working office, I heard two male managers saying that women don't have to go to a good college and the only thing that women should be concerned of is marrying well. There was a boss who even told me, ""If you're not a morning person, how would you prepare breakfast for your husband?"" He said, ""My wife works, too. But she prepares breakfast for me.""In addition, there are problematic sayings that are commonly used in this society, such as ""Woman's beauty peaks at early 20s and declines since then.""Interviewee D. ▷36 years old/ Male/ Office worker/ No, misogyny doesn't exist. - Misogyny doesn't exist in Korean society. I think it's a problem for few people. However, I think this is hardship our society has to face as times change. It's true that Korean women had to endure abusive circumstances in traditional Korean society, sacrificing themselves to do all the house chores and raise children as wife and mother. And now they want to live in a society where everyone is treated equally and participate in society as men do. Although that's the direction the society should go to, it's not settled yet. As a result, some women today shout for their rights while not taking responsibility. In workplaces for instance, you also have to deal with chores such as moving heavy boxes or cleaning up the office besides your team project. Then I find some female employees who would run the easy things and leave men to do the physically hard things.  Of course, men are generally physically stronger than women, and normally they would do the physically demanding things. But some women take men for granted. There are few women would think, 'Oh, I can't do it because I'm a woman. But I should be treated equally for other things.' They believe that men must buy a house to get married, thinking, 'I'm the one who would give birth to a child. It's fair for women to buy furnishings for the home.'If we look at it the other way round, there are some men claiming that they face reverse discrimination. According to them, traditional Korean men had to buy a house to get married and earn money for family, and now men is supposed to do house chores and raise a baby together as well. I think this kind of social atmosphere played a part in widening the gender split.

Korea) Yes, misogyny exists. - Misogyny is not valuing women as a person. This usually manifests itself as only valuing women for sex and not for their intelligence. I think misogyny exists everywhere, but it is more pronounced in Korea. I've noticed it in my time here and I think a big part is the sexualization and infantilization of women that is even more pronounced than in the US. I think the biggest issue is the media and advertisement. Another issue is protective legislation that can fight back against the culture. Where I am from there are many laws protecting women who are in violent relationships or subject to abuse by husbands or romantic partners along with anti-discrimination laws that protect women's rights. In Korea there are none. This is shown also in the fact that in Korea on average women make 2/3rds less than men in the same jobs.Interviewee F. ▷28 years old/ Male/ IT startup (American living in S. Korea)/ I'm not sure. - To be honest, I'm not sure what misogyny is about. I don't know if misogyny exists in Korea because I haven't experienced it. But in my experience of staying here, Korean women seemingly find the pressure to engage in plastic surgery procedures. So I think bad-looking women could face discrimination. (The end of interview pt. 1)From the response of interviewees, you will notice that each of them responded with their own definition on misogyny. It seems the different views themselves reflect the different thoughts on misogyny. Misogyny is still a controversial concept among the public in South Korea.There is significant debate about whether misogyny exists or not. And the most controversial point is the extent of misogyny. It appears that many people in Korea misuse ""misogyny"" because it is interpreted as ""hatred of woman."" Due to the strong image that the word ""hatred"" has, some claim that it's not good interpretation and that the word ""misogyny"" should be interpreted as ""looking down on woman"" instead. What does ""misogyny"" really mean?The Oxford English Dictionary defines ""misogyny"" as ""dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against women.""In fact, the Dictionary of Literary and Critical Terms, the only Korean dictionary that has the word ""misogyny"" as its headword, defines ""misogyny"" as ""the belief that women are intellectually inferior, emotional rather than rational, infantile, and sensual.""While there are dictionary definitions of misogyny, people take it differently on the extent of misogyny. Some would react strongly against the extent of misogyny. ※ The next interview will share opinions on Gangnam murder case, changing gender role, and misogyny controversy that heated the Korean society."

Image courtesy of SCAD.Colleges of art that also administer a bona fide affiliated campus museum featuring a lively exhibition program provide an amazing advantage to their students and the surrounding community, particularly from an educational point of view, as well as the growing positive exposure to the institution and to its enduring reputation. However, it is a rare occasion indeed to discover a robust school of art with a handsome museum attached at the hip that also is surrounded by a uniquely historic built environment, such as the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) and its use of Savannah Gray Brick. SCAD was founded by Paula Wallace, a woman of vision and a thoughtful preservationist, who first saw the potential for adaptively reusing many of the city's great brick buildings that were in disrepair and potential victims of the wrecking ball. She began by saving the magnificent 1892 Savannah Volunteer Guard Armory and turning it into a school for the visual arts--SCAD--which remains today as a testament to the inherent value and aesthetic inspiration of historic preservation.Before examining the current show at SCAD, it's important to get a brief perspective on the history of this great American city. In 1733, James Oglethorpe and 114 colonists from England arrived on the Savannah River to found America's thirteenth colony, Georgia. The idea was to increase imperial trade and navigation along the coastal waterway and to establish a protective buffer during the Spanish War. Oglethorpe demonstrated remarkable vision and foresight as he designed the basic layout of Savannah into blocks of five symmetrical lots and twenty-four public squares, earning the distinction of ""America's first planned city."" Today this wonderful, genteel southern town certainly is among the finest preserved communities in America, constructed brick by brick from the area's rich native clay soil--the silver lining that protected over 2,300 structures through centuries of deterioration, turmoil and the debilitating Civil War.  Installation of ""Built, World"" at SCAD Museum of Art. Photo courtesy of SCAD. Foreground: Wim Delvoye, D-11 Scale Model 2.0, 2008, Laser-cut stainless steel, 38 ¼ x 87 ¾ x 48 in. Courtesy of Sperone Westwater Gallery, New York.""Built,World"" is a group exhibition highlighting twenty leading international artists, whose works examine architecture and constructed actualities with a assortment of media across a wide range of interpretations and scale. The title couldn't be more appropriate, as the museum itself is a walking, talking work of art, carefully crafted and maintained where possible as an exciting, groundbreaking showplace that combines vintage industrial architecture with new utilitarian vision, developed and transformed by hotshot architect Christian Sottile, SCAD alumnus and dean of the college's School of Building Arts. Built in 1853, it is the oldest surviving antebellum railroad depot in the country, now housing the SCAD museum and considered a National Historic Landmark. The museum has breathed new life into these ruins after five decades of neglect, which apparently were standing precariously and had an uncertain future. Originally conceived as a major trade post for Savannah, the railroad complex was occupied by Union troops at the close of the Civil War. Salvaged bricks and original heart pine timbers appear throughout the museum, and the high ceilings provide a dramatic setting for the exhibitions, much like Renzo Piano's use of innovative and adaptively reused materials for the new Whitney Museum of American Art in downtown Manhattan.The unusual exhibition through a variety of mediums ""...engages the social landscape, explores the real and mimetic and deconstructs architectural forms, histories and legacies,"" according to the show's curators, Aaron Levi Garvey and Storm Janse van Rensburg. The artists, who are from a variety of countries, including Germany, Belgium, France, Denmark, Iceland, Portugal, Cuba, Angola, Japan, Trinidad, Syria, and India, as well as the United States, assemble an appealing visual document and cohesive supportive arguments for thoughtful environmentalism; appreciating industrialization; related social activism; and historical contexts that we can deduct from this remarkable variety of works that have an underlying common denominator.

Collection of Deutsche Bank, New York.While it's not possible to evaluate each work in the exhibit, the following examples offer a robust overview of this delightful investigation into exciting architectonic subject matter and its subsequent interpretations. Although there have been a great variety of artists and photographers who have documented the built environment, from Eugène Atget to Harry Callahan, the German husband and wife team of Bernd and Hilla Becher was the most pioneering in documenting multiple built structures, from water towers to blast furnaces, bringing to the contemporary art world the inherent aesthetic components of repetition and consistency of architectural DNA to the forefront of contemporary photography.

Bobby Davidson has six mysterious and provocative archival pigment prints that possess an eerie and ghost-like presence; these are oddly beautiful vignettes of the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, objects covered in dust but retaining a measure of dignity and an entirely different perspective. Subjects include a barely recognizable water tower, as well as a park bench, phone booth or a hot dog cart, which were active and occupied prior disaster.  Bobby Davidson, US LETTER, Escalator (Blue), 2012, Archival Pigment Prints, 15 x 20 in. Courtesy of the artist.Perhaps the most dramatic and telling work is US LETTER, Escalator (Blue), which depicts ambulatory electric stairs that are frozen in time, permanently unplugged and unusable, after transporting thousands of commuters like clockwork every day, and then suddenly, horribly, shut down for good. While it is very difficult for artists to find and portray splendor and mystery in tragedy, Davidson has found a respectful and strangely lovely end run, which may be the most memorable in this exhibition.Perhaps the most ingenious and literally jaw-dropping handmade object in this show is Wim Delvoye's D-11 Scale Model 2.0, courtesy of Sperone Westwater Gallery (see installation image above), where the sculptor meticulously laser-cut stainless steel into the shape of a bulldozer that offers an irony of depth and width as well as weight and volume.  Susan Hefuna, Grid Drawing, 2015, Bronze, 9.75 x 10.2 in. Courtesy of the artist and Rhona Hoffman Gallery, Chicago.Susan Hefuna's series of cast bronze wall objects titled Grid Drawing obviously have an appropriate connection to the built environment, as they present a common theme in fabrication, whether a hut made of sticks or the cor-ten steel ribs of a modern skyscraper tied together with orange-hot bolts and the sweat of a construction worker precariously balanced on an open beam.

Neolithic monuments in Wales at the same time incorporated balance and ingenuity and the sheer beauty of man-made minimalist structures, created by collecting or shaping giant rocks. As humankind evolved, it didn't take long for invention and the idea for giant, shaped ""bricks"" were cut and painstakingly moved to eventually take shape as a pyramid. For every millennium, the human spirit continued to progress and use modern and sophisticated methods of building, leaving a legacy that still remains.

Image courtesy of SCAD.Colleges of art that also administer a bona fide affiliated campus museum featuring a lively exhibition program provide an amazing advantage to their students and the surrounding community, particularly from an educational point of view, as well as the growing positive exposure to the institution and to its enduring reputation. However, it is a rare occasion indeed to discover a robust school of art with a handsome museum attached at the hip that also is surrounded by a uniquely historic built environment, such as the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) and its use of Savannah Gray Brick. SCAD was founded by Paula Wallace, a woman of vision and a thoughtful preservationist, who first saw the potential for adaptively reusing many of the city's great brick buildings that were in disrepair and potential victims of the wrecking ball. She began by saving the magnificent 1892 Savannah Volunteer Guard Armory and turning it into a school for the visual arts--SCAD--which remains today as a testament to the inherent value and aesthetic inspiration of historic preservation.Before examining the current show at SCAD, it's important to get a brief perspective on the history of this great American city. In 1733, James Oglethorpe and 114 colonists from England arrived on the Savannah River to found America's thirteenth colony, Georgia. The idea was to increase imperial trade and navigation along the coastal waterway and to establish a protective buffer during the Spanish War. Oglethorpe demonstrated remarkable vision and foresight as he designed the basic layout of Savannah into blocks of five symmetrical lots and twenty-four public squares, earning the distinction of ""America's first planned city."" Today this wonderful, genteel southern town certainly is among the finest preserved communities in America, constructed brick by brick from the area's rich native clay soil--the silver lining that protected over 2,300 structures through centuries of deterioration, turmoil and the debilitating Civil War.

Courtesy of Sperone Westwater Gallery, New York.""Built,World"" is a group exhibition highlighting twenty leading international artists, whose works examine architecture and constructed actualities with a assortment of media across a wide range of interpretations and scale. The title couldn't be more appropriate, as the museum itself is a walking, talking work of art, carefully crafted and maintained where possible as an exciting, groundbreaking showplace that combines vintage industrial architecture with new utilitarian vision, developed and transformed by hotshot architect Christian Sottile, SCAD alumnus and dean of the college's School of Building Arts. Built in 1853, it is the oldest surviving antebellum railroad depot in the country, now housing the SCAD museum and considered a National Historic Landmark. The museum has breathed new life into these ruins after five decades of neglect, which apparently were standing precariously and had an uncertain future. Originally conceived as a major trade post for Savannah, the railroad complex was occupied by Union troops at the close of the Civil War. Salvaged bricks and original heart pine timbers appear throughout the museum, and the high ceilings provide a dramatic setting for the exhibitions, much like Renzo Piano's use of innovative and adaptively reused materials for the new Whitney Museum of American Art in downtown Manhattan.The unusual exhibition through a variety of mediums ""...engages the social landscape, explores the real and mimetic and deconstructs architectural forms, histories and legacies,"" according to the show's curators, Aaron Levi Garvey and Storm Janse van Rensburg. The artists, who are from a variety of countries, including Germany, Belgium, France, Denmark, Iceland, Portugal, Cuba, Angola, Japan, Trinidad, Syria, and India, as well as the United States, assemble an appealing visual document and cohesive supportive arguments for thoughtful environmentalism; appreciating industrialization; related social activism; and historical contexts that we can deduct from this remarkable variety of works that have an underlying common denominator.

Collection of Deutsche Bank, New York.While it's not possible to evaluate each work in the exhibit, the following examples offer a robust overview of this delightful investigation into exciting architectonic subject matter and its subsequent interpretations. Although there have been a great variety of artists and photographers who have documented the built environment, from Eugène Atget to Harry Callahan, the German husband and wife team of Bernd and Hilla Becher was the most pioneering in documenting multiple built structures, from water towers to blast furnaces, bringing to the contemporary art world the inherent aesthetic components of repetition and consistency of architectural DNA to the forefront of contemporary photography.

Photo: Beth Phillips, (c) The Easton Foundation / Licensed by VAGA, NY Courtesy of the Wieland Collection, Atlanta.The late Louise Bourgeois' Untitled ink and watercolor created in 1946 is an unexpected and unusual surprise, depicting a four-story dollhouse-like form filled with domestic objects. Bobby Davidson has six mysterious and provocative archival pigment prints that possess an eerie and ghost-like presence; these are oddly beautiful vignettes of the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, objects covered in dust but retaining a measure of dignity and an entirely different perspective. Subjects include a barely recognizable water tower, as well as a park bench, phone booth or a hot dog cart, which were active and occupied prior disaster.  Bobby Davidson, US LETTER, Escalator (Blue), 2012, Archival Pigment Prints, 15 x 20 in. Courtesy of the artist.Perhaps the most dramatic and telling work is US LETTER, Escalator (Blue), which depicts ambulatory electric stairs that are frozen in time, permanently unplugged and unusable, after transporting thousands of commuters like clockwork every day, and then suddenly, horribly, shut down for good. While it is very difficult for artists to find and portray splendor and mystery in tragedy, Davidson has found a respectful and strangely lovely end run, which may be the most memorable in this exhibition.Perhaps the most ingenious and literally jaw-dropping handmade object in this show is Wim Delvoye's D-11 Scale Model 2.0, courtesy of Sperone Westwater Gallery (see installation image above), where the sculptor meticulously laser-cut stainless steel into the shape of a bulldozer that offers an irony of depth and width as well as weight and volume.  Susan Hefuna, Grid Drawing, 2015, Bronze, 9.75 x 10.2 in. Courtesy of the artist and Rhona Hoffman Gallery, Chicago.Susan Hefuna's series of cast bronze wall objects titled Grid Drawing obviously have an appropriate connection to the built environment, as they present a common theme in fabrication, whether a hut made of sticks or the cor-ten steel ribs of a modern skyscraper tied together with orange-hot bolts and the sweat of a construction worker precariously balanced on an open beam.  David LaChapelle, Emerald City, 2013, Chromogenic print, 50 x 63 in. Edition of 3. © David LaChapelle Studio. Courtesy of Paul Kasmin Gallery.On the brighter side, renowned and risk-taking Manhattan-based photographer David LaChapelle's large-scale chromogenic print titled Emerald City embodies the true essence of this fascinating show by highlighting a gleaming futuristic architectural masterpiece of a reflective metropolis, which has an uncanny illustrative connection to the Wizard of Oz.

Courtesy of the artist and David Zwirner Gallery, New York.Speaking of glistening cities, Yutaka Sone's extraordinary, luminous white marble carving courtesy of David Zwirner Gallery is a sensational scale-model of Manhattan Island in a relatively accurate representation of America's greatest city as a mighty fortress, where bridges and subway tunnels end and the surrounding bodies of water from the Hudson disappear.

Collection of University of South Florida Contemporary Art Museum, TampaThis super fine exhibition also includes Olafur Eliasson's Your House (Artist's book), Angela Ferreira's For Mozambique, Takahiro Iwasaki's Edinburgh Castle on the Bin Bag (a small plastic city on the top of a cast garbage bag), Los Carpinteros' architectural ""footprints"" cast into rubber flip flops, Roxy Paine's Machinery of Indeterminacy, carved exclusively out of birch wood (from Paul Kasmin Gallery and Kavi Gupta Gallery in Chicago) and James Casebere's Tripoli, a convincing digital chromogenic print mounted to Plexiglas from Sean Kelly Gallery, among others.New revelations for radiocarbon dating have allowed us to age the very first free-standing buildings, constructed around 4000 BC for the sole purpose of shelter and continuous occupancy. Neolithic monuments in Wales at the same time incorporated balance and ingenuity and the sheer beauty of man-made minimalist structures, created by collecting or shaping giant rocks. As humankind evolved, it didn't take long for invention and the idea for giant, shaped ""bricks"" were cut and painstakingly moved to eventually take shape as a pyramid.

21,POLITICS,Inside The 2016 Fight For The White Working Class,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-working-class-voters_us_57c07874e4b02673444fe787,A pro-Clinton labor group is going after Donald Trump's core demographic in swing states.,2016-08-27,"Donald Trump has made the struggles of white, working-class voters central to his campaign. But on-the-ground canvassers are trying to swing voters in the other direction.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c08f4e170000aa0fc75bde.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WICKLIFFE, Ohio ― Joshua Lewis is knocking at a front door when the homeowner pulls into the driveway in a red Toyota pickup truck. Out steps Craig. Craig is fresh off from work, and he’s just the voter Lewis is looking for. Lewis has a question for Craig: If he had to vote in the presidential election tomorrow, whom would he choose ― Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?“I would vote for Trump,” says Craig.It’s not the answer Lewis was hoping to hear. But it’s the reason he’s been knocking on doors in the Cleveland suburbs for months on end, asking people to explain what matters most to them in 2016.“I was a Democrat all the way up to this election,” Craig explains. “We need a change.”“Smart change is better change,” Lewis counters. “A lot of what he’s saying is not only disturbing, but incorrect.”“Look, I don’t think he’s the perfect candidate,” Craig goes on. “But I don’t think she can be trusted. We need integrity.” Lewis and Craig find some common ground in their five-minute chat in the driveway ― both believe trade deals like NAFTA have been bad for American workers ― before Craig gives Lewis his email and phone number, so Lewis can follow up with him before the election. Craig is still leaning toward Trump. “There are some people who say they’ve been Democrats all their lives, but a lack of progress has driven them the other way,” Lewis says after his discussion with Craig. “We have to meet them on their level.”Lewis is a canvasser for Working America, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO union federation. The AFL-CIO created the group in 2003 to make inroads with non-union workers at a time when unions are shrinking. Working America has campaigned to pass Obamacare, raise the minimum wage and stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Right now, it’s all-in against Trump. The group says it has 150 paid, full-time canvassers hitting the pavement hard in a handful of swing states, and as election day nears, that staff will ramp up to 500. Working America’s sweet spot is the same as Trump’s ― working-class, mostly white, former industrial strongholds. Though the vast majority of its support used to come from the AFL-CIO, Working America now pulls much of its funding from foundations and liberal donors, as well as members’ voluntary dues.On a recent evening, Lewis was canvassing in Wickliffe, Ohio, the blue-collar Lake County town where he grew up outside Cleveland. Wickliffe, which went for Obama in 2012, is 93 percent white (Lewis is African-American), and has a median household income of $48,000, according to census data. It’s just the sort of Rust Belt area that pundits point to when they say Trump could potentially redraw the electoral map with his nationalist, anti-trade message, if he can get his campaign in order.“There are folks who like Trump because his promises are appealing to them,” says Lewis. “A lot of them are concerned with the lack of good-paying jobs, and they think someone from the outside can come in and make those changes. But Trump doesn’t have a plan.”The canvassing by Working America illustrates one of Clinton’s many advantages in the election. The former secretary of state has vastly outraised Trump throughout the campaign, and she is hammering her opponent with TV ads in battleground states like Ohio. But beyond her own campaign, groups like Working America are already running an ancillary ground game on Clinton’s behalf. A pillar of the Democratic base, the AFL-CIO and major national unions have uniformly endorsed Clinton ― despite Trump’s proclamations that he is the candidate for union members ― and will run get-out-the-vote operations as the election nears. Working America is particularly invested in the battleground state of Ohio, which Trump will likely need to win if he’s to prevail in November. As of the latest polling, Clinton probably holds a very slight lead in Ohio. Working America has 80 canvassers based in the state. Though it’s now ramping up, the Trump campaign had just 82 staffers nationwide in the month of July. (Clinton, by contrast, had 705.) Come October, Working America’s hopes to have 200 bodies in Ohio.The Ohio staff includes Lewis, whose knuckles are smudged with white paint from knocking on 70 doors a day. (His goal is 40 conversations per shift.) He quit his job as an account manager to join Working America last year. Raised by grandparents who were union members, he wanted to campaign for labor-friendly policies and candidates. Now he finds himself interrupting people’s dinners to hear how they feel about Trump. “The Cleveland area’s been hurt by the loss of manufacturing jobs,” he says. “A lot of people are hurting, and they’re looking for answers.”Voters like Craig are exactly who Lewis and his colleagues want to reach. Craig is not wearing a “Hillary for Prison” T-shirt. He does not appear to be a white nationalist. Hell, he typically votes Democratic. Craig is just another guy who thinks the cost of living is too high and wages are too low. And like a lot of voters, he says he has trust issues with the Democratic nominee. “We’re up against years and years of what people have been hearing on television,” Lewis says. As one would expect from the favorability polling, Lewis’ Wicliffe canvass turns up plenty of distaste for the Democratic nominee, some of it startling: “I don’t care for her.” “I don’t believe in her.” “I think she’s a liar.” “She’s a murderer.” Sometimes his goal is simply to warm someone to the idea of Clinton being president. “It’s tough to start out in a hole where you’re explaining that she wasn’t indicted,” he says.On his nightly canvass, Lewis is aiming for what he calls pivots. There are two kinds. The half-pivot is when you steer an undecided voter toward Clinton’s side of the line. The full pivot is when you take a Trump supporter and flip him or her to Clinton. Not surprisingly, full pivots are much more elusive. The day before he met Craig, Lewis says he pulled off a rare feat ― half-pivoting a libertarian.His proudest pivot came in Brunswick, Ohio, south of Cleveland. He was speaking to a single mother who said she had voted for Obama but now supported Trump. Her biggest concern was education. Lewis told her Trump has floated the idea of eliminating the Department of Education (true). By the time he stepped off the front stoop, the woman said she planned on voting for Clinton.Before he can sway someone, Lewis needs them to explain what’s important to them going into the election. “We’re holding up a mirror and letting them talk,” he says. “I just try to plant a seed. Give them a chance to verbalize their thoughts on the election and the working class. I want to have a polite talk with the facts, try to have people open up and have a conversation.”Working America was one of the first groups to document Trump’s potential appeal in the Rust Belt in a general election. Back in the winter ― when most pundits and odds-makers were still writing Trump off in the GOP primary ― canvassers like Lewis were talking with people in Pittsburgh and Cleveland on their front porches, hearing their thoughts and concerns. They called it the “front porch focus group.”They concluded that, out of the entire cluttered field of Republicans and Democrats, Trump was the single most popular candidate with the hundreds of people they spoke to. The group issued a splashy report essentially sounding the alarm: “Key white working-class voters have not made up their minds yet in the 2016 presidential race, but of those who have, Donald Trump is the strongest choice.” Once Working America endorsed Clinton, the group began actively campaigning against Trump.Near the end of his night canvassing in Wickliffe, Lewis knocks on the door of a 34-year-old mother who’s never voted before. She recently registered to vote, after growing concerned about a plan to consolidate local schools. Lewis asks her a simple question that she clearly doesn’t get asked often: What’s important to her and her family right now?“Better wages would be nice,” she says after a long pause. “Anything more than I’m making right now.”This will be the first time she ever casts a ballot for president. She was jazzed about it, until the candidates were decided. “Honestly, I don’t care for either one,” she says.Lewis leaves after a five-minute chat on her steps, the undecided voter still undecided. But all in all, Lewis considers the talk a success. “We’re letting people flesh out their own stories,” he says. “And it pumps me up when I’m at a door and someone’s willing to listen.”"

Sort of.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c0ae181700000011c75c7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal appeals court on Friday seemed to reach a limited compromise in the controversy over Wisconsin’s voter identification law, which has been in the crosshairs of multiple lawsuits and appeals for years.With one judge recused, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit consolidated the disputes and issued an order that kept the law on the books, but appeared to give voting rights advocates a small consolation prize ahead of the November election.The court explicitly rejected a softening device ― like one ordered by a federal judge this month in Texas ― that would allow voters lacking the required voter ID card to simply sign an affidavit attesting to their identity before they cast a ballot.Instead, the court accepted assurances from the state of Wisconsin that its Division of Motor Vehicles would “mail automatically a free photo ID to anyone who comes to DMV one time and initiates the free ID process.”“No one must present documents, that, for some, have proved challenging to acquire; no one must show a birth certificate, proof of citizenship, and the like,” the court noted, quoting the state from a prior legal filing.The 7th Circuit stressed that mere “initiation” of this process ― showing up at the DMV, regardless of what documentation the prospective voter has ― was enough for a voter to receive a voting credential at no cost.But this also presupposes that affected voters, especially those of lesser means or without transportation, actually can make it to a DMV location. Or that the state will actually keep voters informed that this mechanism even exists.Pointing to other rulings striking down similar voter ID laws in other states, the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought one of the lawsuits against Wisconsin, didn’t seem to trust the state to deliver.“Two trial courts have found that, over the last five years, Wisconsin has utterly failed to get IDs into the hands of voters who need them,” Sean Young, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s voting rights project, said in a statement. “There’s no reason to believe that the state’s latest eleventh-hour ‘emergency’ procedures will work any better than its past failed policies.”Young added that the ACLU would keep fighting the law in court, but didn’t say whether he would seek Supreme Court review.Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who specializes in election law, wrote in a blog post that, given time constraints ahead of the November election, it’s unlikely that the Supreme Court would intervene.“I think this is the end of the line for this election,” Hasen wrote."

Much like the changing winds of Britney Spears’ career, this award show is famous for its unpredictability — but there are a few things we can confirm about the actual ceremony. Before the VMAs kick off at 9 p.m. ET, Snapchat impresario DJ Khaled will serve as the pre-show host alongside MTV2’s Charlamagne Tha God and MTV’s “Wonderland” Host Lizzo. Major pre-show key?

26,POLITICS,Donald Trump: The NSA Is ‘Coddling’ Hillary Clinton,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-nsa-hillary-clinton_us_57c1b036e4b085c1ff29a190,"The intelligence agency has access to Clinton's deleted emails, according to the real estate mogul.",2016-08-27,"Donald Trump is fond of calling Hillary Clinton ""Crooked Hillary.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c1b0fb1700000011c75e1e.jpeg?cache=jF0vCRVMKB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump accused the National Security Agency on Friday of having the ability to access Hillary Clinton’s erased emails, but declining to do so in order to protect the Democratic presidential nominee.“I hear the NSA maybe has the emails,” Trump said in a phone interview on Fox News’ “On The Record.” “A lot of people say the NSA would have the emails if they really wanted to get them.”“Obviously they don’t want to get them,” he added. “They’re protecting her, they’re coddling her. And it’s the only way she could even consider running.”Clinton deleted some 32,000 personal emails from a private server she used as secretary of state after her lawyers determined that they did not contain information relevant to her work for the government. The State Department has already released 30,000 of Clinton’s work-related emails to the public, and is scheduled to release an additional 15,000 in the coming months. In July, the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to prosecute Clinton for using a private email server during her time as secretary. FBI Director James Comey, a Republican, condemned Clinton’s behavior as “extremely careless” after the agency found there were 100 classified messages on the private server. But Comey argued that “no reasonable prosecutor” would press charges because of the absence of evidence that Clinton intended to use the server to send classified information. None of the classified information she sent or received was entirely properly marked as classified.Trump has argued that Clinton’s deletion of a portion of the emails is evidence of a criminal coverup that law enforcement should have pressed charges on.Trump implied on Friday that Clinton’s only reason for deleting the emails is that they contained some kind of damning evidence against her.“She knows what was on those emails and it was very, very bad,” he said. “And maybe somebody should, in fact, ask the NSA whether or not they have the emails.”Attributing unsubstantiated rumors to an anonymous “they” is one of Trump’s preferred methods for peddling theories without fully taking ownership of them.He employed the same language to accuse the NSA of going easy on Clinton during a campaign rally in Altoona, Pennsylvania, earlier this month. “I don’t know what the law is, but they say that they would have the emails,” he said.“I guess somebody came out from the NSA and they said, ‘We have everybody’s emails,’” Trump continued, apparently referring to the revelations of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. “So I don’t think they tried too hard. Do you, folks?”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
27,POLITICS,Trump Goes Back To Original Immigration Position With Second 180 Flip,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-immigration-flip-iowa_us_57c21d25e4b085c1ff29b41f,"He now promises immediate action on deportation, with no mention of a path to legal status.",2016-08-27,"Trump said that if elected, he would ""begin swiftly removing"" the ""hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants"" who are in the country.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c21d8e170000a014c75ecf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DES MOINES, Iowa – Donald Trump’s experiment with “softening” his immigration policy came to a dramatic end Saturday in a fairgrounds livestock pavilion, with the Republican presidential nominee promising deportations within an hour of his inauguration.“We are going to rid of the criminals, and it’s going to happen within one hour after I take office,” he said. “We will move justly, but we will move fast. Believe me.”Trump has made the forcible deportation of the 11 million people in the country without documentation a cornerstone of his presidential campaign from its start last year. It made him a favorite among a segment of the Republican base, and helped him win the nomination over a dozen Republican senators and governors.Then, last week, Trump explained in an appearance on Fox News that “thousands and thousands” of people he had met with on the issue had urged him not to deport undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for years and have no criminal record, but rather stable jobs and families. That new tack brought an immediate backlash from some of his hardcore supporters – including author Ann Coulter – for breaking his promise, as well as “I told you so” claims from mainstream GOP critics who had long predicted his eventual flip.Trump backtracked on his new position later in the week – including in a CNN interview, where he claimed the modification was not a “softening” but actually “a hardening.” The Saturday remarks appear to complete the process, with Trump suggesting that undocumented immigrants commit a significant percentage of the country’s crimes and making zero mention of finding some way for those who have not committed any crimes to stay.He also asserted – without any supporting evidence – that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would, if she were to win, end “all routine immigration enforcement.”“In other words, totally open borders. Which will lead to a massive crime wave,” Trump said.“I think he was trying to make up for his missteps,” said Brian Zegers, a 48-year-old personnel consultant who attended the biker-themed event in a leather vest and bandana. Smiling, Zegers attributed Trump’s original reversal to the advice of consultants and said the reversal of the reversal was just what the boisterous crowd of Trump supporters wanted to hear.Other, more committed Trump fans said his shifts in position were of no concern to them. “The message will get tightened up before the election,” said Jim De Kruif, 57 an investment adviser who has always assumed that Trump will modify his policies heading into the general election. “That’s what politicians do.”Trump also continued his recent practice of pledging to work for African-Americans and Latinos in front of virtually all-white audiences. He spent about five minutes of his 50-minute speech promising lower taxes for family farms and offering a commitment to the corn-based ethanol mandate in gasoline for his Iowa audience, and then spent twice as long telling members of the two ethnic minorities that the Democratic Party had not helped them and that they should support Trump. “What do you have to lose?” he asked, repeating a new favorite line.Saturday’s event was organized by Iowa’s freshman Sen. Joni Ernst, the second of what she is hopes will become an annual ritual: a motorcycle rally raising money for a veterans’ charity, followed by a GOP pep rally.Trump, though, did not participate in the motorcycle ride from the local Harley Davidson dealership to the Iowa State Fairgrounds. Instead, as is his preference, he flew in specifically for the event aboard his personal airliner, delivering the final speech of the afternoon to the crowd of about 2,000.Ernst and other Iowa elected officials preceded Trump on stage. While urging voters to support Trump, the leaders spent little time praising their presidential nominee, and mainly pointed out the importance of keeping Supreme Court nominations out of Clinton’s hands.Even that approach, though, could not entirely insulate the hometown Republicans from the danger of such a volatile candidate at the top of their ticket. At a news conference to explain the benefits of the ride for a veteran’s charity, Ernst was confronted with a question about one of the latest controversies for Trump’s campaign: reports of CEO Steve Bannon’s domestic violence charge from his first marriage.Ernst pointed out that it was not her job to vet Trump’s staff. “I am not making the hiring decisions,” she said, but then quickly added: “Sexual assault and domestic violence is never OK – is never OK.”"

The sources also said the jets hit six Islamic State targets.Turkish military sources said one of its soldiers was killed and three others wounded when a tank was hit by a rocket that they said was fired from territory held by the Kurdish YPG. The sources said the army shelled the area in response.Syrian rebels opposed to Ankara’s incursion said Turkish forces had targeted forces allied to the YPG and no Kurdish forces were in the area.On the ground, Turkish-backed Syrian rebels fought forces aligned with the SDF near the frontier town of Jarablus. Forces opposed to Ankara said Turkish tanks were deployed, a charge denied by Turkey’s rebel allies.Turkey’s offensive into Syria began on Wednesday, supporting its rebel allies with Turkish special forces, tanks and warplanes. It seized control of Jarablus from Islamic State seeking to stop any Kurdish forces moving in first.Saturday’s use of warplanes against what Turkey said was a Kurdish YPG militia target highlights its determination to prevent any Kurdish territorial expansion in north Syria.Any action against Kurdish forces in Syria puts Turkey at odds with its NATO ally the United States, which backs the SDF and YPG, seeing them as the most reliable and effective ally in the fight against Islamic State in Syria.It adds complexity to the Syrian conflict that erupted five years ago with an uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and has since drawn in regional states and world powers.“DANGEROUS ESCALATION”The Jarablus Military Council, part of the SDF, had said earlier on Saturday that Turkish planes hit the village of al-Amarna south of Jarablus, causing civilian casualties. It called the action “a dangerous escalation”.The Kurdish-led administration that controls parts of northern Syria said Turkish tanks advanced on al-Amarna and clashed with forces of the Jarablus Military Council. But the Kurdish administration said no Kurdish forces were involved.However, the leader of one Turkey-backed rebel group gave a rival account. He told Reuters the rebels battled the Kurdish YPG around al-Amarna and denied any Turkish tanks took part.Turkish security forces simply said Turkish-backed forces had extended their control to five villages beyond Jarablus.A video released by Turkey’s military showed the Turkish Red Crescent distributing food and aid to people in Jarablus, with the help of Turkish troops. It also showed what appeared to be Turkish-backed rebels flicking v-for-victory signs in the town.The newly formed Jarablus Military Council has said it was made up of people from the area with the aim of capturing the town and the surrounding region from Islamic State militants. However, the Turkish-backed rebels seized Jarablus first.Several militias under the SDF banner pledged support to Jarablus Military Council after it reported the Turkish bombing.The Northern Sun Battalion, an SDF faction, said in a statement it was heading to “Jarablus fronts” to help the council against “threats made by factions belonging to Turkey”.Tension has mounted in Syria’s Aleppo region in the past year between the U.S-backed Kurdish YPG force and its allies on one hand and Turkish-backed rebel groups on the other. The two sides have clashed on several occasions.(Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay and Orhan Coskun in Ankara and Tom Perry in Beirut; Writing by Edmund Blair; Editing by Ros Russell)"

The United States has insisted that the Syrian air force, which has dropped barrel bombs and chlorine on residential areas, be grounded but Lavrov said on Friday that was not the goal.Assad’s future is not part of the current talks. Instead, discussions are focused on finding an effective and lasting solution to end the violence, which would open negotiations on a political transition in Syria.“If the remaining details can be completed, we believe we will be able to address the two primary challenges to the cessation of hostilities - the regime violations and the increasing influence of the al-Nusra Front,” Kerry said.Kerry believes the plan is the best chance to limit fighting that is driving thousands of Syrians into exile in Europe and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching tens of thousands more.The talks came as opposition groups effectively surrendered the Damascus suburb of Daraya to the government after a grueling four-year siege.Kerry said the Syrian regime had “forced the surrender” of Daraya in contravention of the February cessation of hostilities agreement, but Lavrov said the local accord was an “example” that should be “replicated”.The Russian foreign minister said another besieged area was “interested in such an operation with mediation of the Russian Federation.” He did not name the area.Residents and insurgents in Daraya began to leave the besieged area where civilians have been trapped since 2012 and the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross expressed concern for their safety.(Additional reporting by Lisa Barrington in Beirut and Firas Makdesi and Kinda Makieh in Damascus; Editing by Richard Balmforth and Tom Brown)"

However, the decision only became public on Aug. 22, to the dismay of animal protection groups like IFAW and Friends of the Koala.The construction is part of a 96-mile upgrade of the Pacific Highway between the towns of Woolgooga and Ballina. Specifically, animal advocates and environmentalists are opposed to Section 10 of the highway, a four-lane, eight-mile expanse planned to run between the towns of Wardell and Ballina, Thompson-Jones said. That’s because this portion of the route will cut directly through the middle of the habitat of around 200 koalas, known as “Ballina’s koalas.”Clearing for the construction will destroy half of the koala’s food trees, Phillips told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in April. But food source destruction isn’t the only peril the highway will bring. The commotion caused by cutting down the trees, as well as the highway construction, could have fatal consequences.“Koalas often get panicked and stressed and will not move, sometimes dying as a result of the stress or getting ill or starving,” Thompson-Jones said. “Some of these koalas will be separated from their social group of koalas and have to find each other.”Stress also reduces how much koalas reproduce and makes them more susceptible to the effects of illnesses like retrovirus, chlamydia and pneumonia, she said. And on the ground, searching for new trees to live in, they’re more vulnerable to attacks from predators. And finally, both the construction itself and the existence of the highway will increase the risk of vehicle strikes — a major source of deaths for koalas around the country.However, New South Wales’ Roads and Maritime Services Department contends that activists are overblowing the concerns and the koalas will be fine. They conducted their own analysis, released in February, and found that the highway would reduce the koala population by less than 10 percent, News.com.au reported. The department also stated that the koalas are already dying off, with or without a highway.Plans to offset damage done to the koalas include fencing to keep them off the roadway, wildlife crossings to provide a safe way for animals to get across the road and the planting of about half a square mile of revegetation to make up for the trees lost, according to an RMS statement.But activists say that’s not going to cut it. For one thing, koalas are highly territorial: It’s unlikely many of them will move to a new area of their own accord, Thompson-Jones said.She called the revegetation strategy “misleading,” noting that it includes plants which studies have shown the local koala population rarely eat, and one variety that’s not local. On top of that, the plantings will take between four to seven years before they’re even viable for the koalas to eat, she said.And none of the RMS’ plans will mitigate the stress and immediate disturbance the construction will cause.While cute and iconic koalas have grabbed most of the media attention surrounding the road, they aren’t the only species potentially threatened.“Section 10 of the highway is currently known to be home to over 30 state and-or nationally threatened species,” Thompson-Jones said. In particular, conservationists have voiced concern for the long-nosed potoroo, a native marsupial that thrives in what is now the highway’s path.“The area where the Highway is going through,” Thompson-Jones said, “is a tranquil paradise.”"

36,PARENTS,"In A World Of Bullies, Be A Real Man","J.W. Holland, ContributorPolitical Writer and Editor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-a-world-of-bullies-be-a-real-man_us_57c1fa54e4b06384eb3ffe0d,It’s been an interesting couple of weeks for me. Indeed it has been a time that I continue to be disappointed in my fellow,2016-08-27,"<strong>Are physically weaker males real men? According to David French's article, the answer is no.</strong>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c1fe311700000411c75ea5.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been an interesting couple of weeks for me. Indeed it has been a time that I continue to be disappointed in my fellow men. Not the generic word man as in “mankind” but the very specific “male,” variety of our species. I keep asking myself the same question, “when will we grow up?”My oldest son has been dealing with a group of bullies at school for the better part of a year. They tease him with cursing and insults. Calling him a “fag” and telling him he isn’t good enough to go out for sports. They gang up on him in a group, like a pack of jackals circling a gazelle. This past week we made the decision to move him to another school that, from our research, seems to have a better handle on such issues.Oh, I have heard all the jargon about this type of situation. “Toughen ’em up!” or “Let him kick their asses!” All that sounds great until you realize that, number one that isn’t how the real world works. Number two he was outnumbered and could have ended up in an even worse situation. My son is a good looking intelligent kid. He is an accomplished swimmer and an extreme extrovert. Yet, he was targeted.◊♦◊Bullying isn’t about just going after weaker victims; it’s also going after those you view as a threat. It’s a defense mechanism of the insecure and unproperly trained. Unfortunately, it begins at home and is fueled by parents who are either themselves bullies, or unable to see any fault in their own offspring.I never really had a problem being bullied in school. Sure there was the occasional jerk you had to deal with but not to the extent I saw it happen to others, or to the degree that it happens today. I am well aware of those around me who had a much worse experience.We live to attack those who are different from us, be it based on skin color, sexuality, religion, atheism, weight, political views, or even socio-economic status. This country seems to thrive on it. Go to a political rally, especially this year, and listen. Not just to the speakers but also to what is being said in the crowds. We have no respect for each other, and we have no restraint in voicing those opinions.We’ve not grown at all as a country in this area. No matter what we say this problem is increasing. Social media is the new hunting ground for these predators. Every picture posted, every status update, every tweet and opinion in public view open you up to attack from the faceless trolls who never grew out of middle school.I have had an acquaintance who’s son committed suicide at 11 because of bullying. And seeing stories like this are becoming all too common. When a kid is left feeling that his only option is to “give up” and take their own life, it is an indictment on the entire civilization.Bullying isn’t just an issue that is relegated to the male of the species either. Girls are victims and participants as well. We however rarely tell our daughters they should “suck it up and deal with it!”◊♦◊ Then today as I am scrolling Facebook I see this article from David French, and I realized, we may never grow up.French goes on a long diatribe about how we are a culture that is no longer raising men basically because we don’t enroll them all in gym memberships. That because we don’t make them change oil or build porches, they aren’t able to develop masculinity. He states that we should “never ever underestimate the positive effect that raw physical strength can have on a young man’s development.”While all that sounds great, and it hits on the key points of a Trump testosterone driven movement. It’s bullshit!To simply focus in on this generation and claim that we are in some extreme moment of de-masculinity is to ignore human history. It’s also an argument that has been used in previous generations. It’s an argument that again, says women aren’t equal and can’t compete. It’s an argument against education, technology advancement, and innovation!Mainly it’s an argument used by bullies!Do we tell someone that doesn’t do manual labor for a living, say a writer for the National Review, that he is less of a man because of his chosen profession? We shouldn’t, but apparently that is what we are supposed to do. Do we tell a physically challenged male that he isn’t really a man? I mean after all his grip strength may not be on par with a coal miner from 1935!I would ask Mr. French to compare his requirements as a youth to that of his father’s. Then compare his father’s to his grandfather’s. They aren’t equal for a couple of reasons. Technology, and intelligence. Human’s are intelligent, we are constantly looking for better, and yes easier, ways of doing things. When is the last time you saw a farmer plowing a field behind a mule? When is the last time you heard of a logging company that only used axes and hand saws? They don’t because that would be inefficient and stupid! But according to French’s argument, using a chainsaw, or riding in an air conditioned tractor means you’ve been brainwashed by militant feminists, hellbent on putting you in a dress!◊♦◊French makes an argument against the instant oil change. While I do like to change my oil and my sons do help me occasionally, the argument has a problem. Who do you think is doing the oil changes at the local quick lube? It certainly, at least so far, isn’t done by robots. For the most part, it’s younger men, and yes some women, who are working entry level automotive jobs to learn a skill.The article also ignores another fact of generational difference. Humans get smarter with the passage of time. I suppose we should harken back to a day when we died of chickenpox, but we could bare knuckle fight a bear.What do bullies say? You’re not as strong, you’re fat, you’re slow, you can’t do what I can do! Those types of beliefs lead to things like 13-year-olds taking their his life because he didn’t think he could ever fit in. A belief he would never measure up to some trivial standard that “men” should reach.It’s not only an incorrect argument Mr. French; it’s dangerous.So while David French may not agree, I am raising men. Three of them. Men who will respect their fellow “man”. Who will judge people on the content of their character and not by how much they can bench. Men who will be secure in their masculinity enough to know that women in the workforce aren’t a threat if you’re willing to work and compete on an equal playing field. Men who can lay their heads down at night knowing that all they’ve received in life was earned, not because of their sex, but because of their drive.Then I will be able to sleep at night knowing, in some part, I contributed to the betterment of society. Not just from my own actions, but through the legacy of real men that will follow me.That, Mr. French, is what real strength is.―- This article originally appeared on The Good Men Project Photo:Flickr/Stuart Grout"

And no, I’m not on vacation. It’s just a normal workday.A year ago, I would have been embarrassed to admit this. After all, I live and work in the United States where sleeping in the middle of the day is practically stigmatized. In my 20s, my friends and I proudly proclaimed (as we downed cases of energy drinks) “Who needs sleep? There’s plenty of time to sleep when we’re dead!”Today, I’m more embarrassed by that admission than I am of saying I regularly schedule power naps into my days because, the truth is, it was that kind of twisted thinking in my younger years that left me feeling perpetually irritable and exhausted — not exactly qualities that inspire creative thinking.As a writer and creative, I was sabotaging the very things that fuel my best creative work: a rested mind, a relaxed body and a refreshed spirit.I realized there was nothing noble about being sleep deprived, or denying I needed more shut eye. So I started getting to bed earlier.At first, the motivation to get more sleep was purely vain. I got tired of looking in the mirror and seeing a sallow complexion and dark circles around my eyes. After watching Arianna Huffington’s TedWomen talk, How to Succeed? Get More Sleep, I realized not only did I need more beauty sleep, I also needed more Creativity ZZZs if I wanted to get better at my writing craft.Creativity ZZZs, as I call it, are 10- to 20-minute power naps that I work into my schedule a few times a week, usually between noon and 3 p.m.In South America, where my family’s from, it’s not unusual for people to take a “siesta” in the afternoon. But in the U.S., naps have become the domain of the “lazy”, the “unproductive” folks who either don’t work or don’t want to work.But there’s a growing body of research that makes the case for getting more sleep. Sleep, it turns out, is not just good for your body. It also boosts your creativity.Here’s what I discovered when I started taking more cat naps:Ideas FlowedIt no longer felt like I was trying to pull thoughts out of cotton. At a certain point in the afternoon, usually around three o’clock, I hit a mental wall. In the past, I tried to climb over that wall with gallons of caffeine and sugar. But that did nothing to unlock ideas or creative musing that seemed trapped in dark, unreachable corners of my brain. The crash that inevitably ensued after my caffeine high only made me feel worse. But after a power nap, my mind is able to brainstorm and draw connections between seemingly disparate ideas because it’s clear and refreshed.Got More FocusedCreative work requires uninterrupted stretches of time where you are immersed in whatever activity you undertake. It’s what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls Flow. Power naps help me get more focused, and more “in the flow.” I stop reading the same sentence in an email, a book, a blog post, an article, even my own writing, over and over again trying to understand what I was reading. After a nap, I feel reinvigorated and ready to focus on something intensely for a longer period of time.Became More EnergizedAs a kid, I spent my summers in Colombia, where my parents were born. On most days everyone took “siesta”, an afternoon nap usually taken after lunch. That makes sense, of course, since most people tend to feel sluggish between noon and 4 p.m., the time of day that coincides with the lowest point in our circadian cycles. My low point usually begins around 2 p.m. when my eyelids start to feel heavy and my brain starts to slow. A short nap can feel like a shot of espresso without the caffeine jitters.Became HappierThere’s no doubt sleep deprivation can leave you feeling cranky, irritable and moody. In fact, studies have shown that even partial sleep deprivation has a significant effect on mood.“People who have problems with sleep are at an increased risk for developing emotional disorders (such as) depression and anxiety,” says Harvard University professor Dr. Lawrence Epstein.Feeling tired and run down is not just bad for your mood, it’s bad for creative endeavors because stress and anxiety feed creative blocks. But when you’re feeling good and rested, ideas flow which leads to more good feelings.So if you if you want to be at your creative best, do yourself a favor:Go take a nap."
38,TRAVEL,The Happy Truths Of A Solo Traveler,"Katie Lesniewski, ContributorWriter, Editor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/solo-the-mostly-beautiful-and-sometimes-brutal-truths_us_57c0baa5e4b0b01630dee130,You will realize that it's not all about you.,2016-08-27,"<p><em>Humboldt Falls, Hollyford Valley Southland</em></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c1de4f1800002700bcd82d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“I haven’t been everywhere, but it’s on my list.” ― Susan Sontag4:30am. Tasman Sea. Twelve people. One boat. We set off in search of orca (killer) whales, but it soon became clear that the captain had other intentions. Namely, death. Or as the first mate put it: “pounding the fear of the sea into you lot”. My nine companions in this expedition were in a wedding party from South Africa. They helped me untangle the straps of my life jacket and we huddled together in hopes of surviving the next four hours. Between jolts of the boat and mouthfuls of water, we exchanged the usual questions and answers of where we were from and how long we were traveling. After the deck flung us into the air for one particularly back-bruising jump, one of the women looked at me and said: “You’re so brave.”Really? Me? Why? The simple answer: because I was traveling on my own. The long answer: because I was traveling on my own, and signed up for a boat ride with a bunch of strangers, at a time when the waters were so dark and dangerous the sun dared not shine, and still you could hear me talking about adventure with a silly grin on my face. Perhaps your next adventure is just a step, drive or flight away, but you might never leave if you keep waiting for someone to go with you. Take hold of your deepest core value – bravery, strength, joy, compassion, generosity, ambition – and make the leap!Truth #1: You will be on your ownSo you’ve decided to be an independent world traveler? Congratulations! You brave one, you. All I can say is bring a bottle of water, a book and a smile wherever you go and you will go far. Only eleven percent of world travelers are flying solo. For my first long-term solo trip, I went to New Zealand in the spring (their autumn) of this year. The landscape boasted rolling green pastures, sparkling turquoise waters, and friendly faces as far as the eye could see. While I did not spot any whales, I saw plenty of dolphins! An island getaway might be just the thing you need for a breath of fresh, salty air. The South Pacific is speckled with islands you could be hopping!Truth #2: You will meet loads of peopleSure you’re traveling alone, but that doesn’t mean you should be lonely. You have the potential to meet all the people, see all the places, and do all the things your heart desires. If you want to share a baguette with a stranger at a corner café, you can! If you want to hike Mount Doom with a new friend (who just happens to look like Frodo), you can! If you want to go boogie-boarding down a sand dune with a parrot on your shoulder, you can! Basically what I’m saying is: if you believe you can, you can! Of course there are several important factors to consider, but your bank account should not determine your amount of fun. If you can’t afford another night out on the town with the Brits, then settle in for a wild game of Monopoly with the post-army Israelis.There’s such a wide variety of people on the road, and while a lot of them are friendly and game, not everyone is going to talk to you or treat you with basic respect. Trust your instincts. I cannot emphasize this one enough. That feeling in your gut, that tap on your shoulder, that spidey-sense tingling – trust it. Be strong and vulnerable, but most importantly be aware. If you stay true to the goodness within you, then you will meet good people. These people might stick around for a day or stay in your heart forever. Appreciate the power of connections. Don’t hole up in your hotel room. See the sights! If you travel with joy and confidence, then you’ll have no problem meeting new people. Mankind has legs to wander and arms to embrace.Truth #3: You will make (and break) a budgetThis is inevitable. Money does not grow on trees in any land. No matter how magical it would be to dive into the Great Barrier Reef or take a trip to Hobbiton, it’s going to cost you. Transportation, food and accommodation are major drains on that contemptible bank account balance. That’s not even mentioning all of the activities that you’ll want to experience. I made a budget for several months of trekking New Zealand. Since I was on that side of the world, I figured I might as well visit Australia, too. I bought tickets to Sydney and Melbourne and obliterated my bank account. The detour cost me a few weeks of travel and I had to return to the States early. Was it worth it? I’m not entirely sure. Sometimes less is more. Sometimes it isn’t. If you’re wondering how much “spending money” to have: plan for spontaneity.Truth #4: You will experience time travelAnd its effects, which include, but are not limited to: bad skype timing, bad breath on long flights (bring a mini tube of toothpaste and toothbrush in your carry-on, you won’t regret it), and seriously bad doubts about your decision to leave behind all the familiar things of your life. Because in reality, no matter where you are or what time zone you’re sporting those tennis shoes in, plans don’t always workout (and people don’t understand that by tennis shoes you mean sneakers).Before I made it to New Zealand, I had a seven-hour layover in Fiji. I planned to get out of the airport and explore the island. It was a bright, sunny day and the beach was calling. However, thanks to my terrible sense of direction, I entered the airport through the wrong line and the customs officers wouldn’t let me leave.So I did what any sensible person would do. I sat in a corner and cried. Eventually, a beam of fluorescent light poked through my misery and I realized that this moment could make or break my trip. I wiped at my eyes and looked around. There was a guy sprawled out on a couch on the other end of the terminal. After a casual walk-by, I plopped down on the chair beside him and started talking. He had fourteen tattoos. I had fifty-two cards. He had some cheesy jokes. I had a loud laugh. Soon enough we forgot all about the time. Even though we didn’t get to feel the foreign sand between our toes, we did get to experience something new: each other! Forget the doubts. Forget the time constraints. All you have promised is this moment. Seize it.Truth #5: You will have many momentsHopefully you will have at least one Moment with a capital “M”. Will it be meeting the love of your life? Will it be eating a slug off the oldest kauri tree in the rain forest? In the moment, you’ll know it. It will feel like the heavens are opening up to reveal something just for you.In Kaikoura, New Zealand – an east coast beach town crawling with seals – I took a rusty, red bike for a two hours’ ride along the peninsula. The bike seat broke off as the country road hit a dead end. Grumbling to myself about the bruise on my bum, I hauled the bike over a low wired fence, through a pasture of dairy cows, and across an abandoned railroad track. For once my lack of an internal compass paid off, as I stepped onto a black sand beach. I dropped the bike and dove into the sea. The waves crashed over my head. The waters swirled around like a troupe of dancers, and I had a Moment. As though my soul suddenly remembered the beauty of being.The nightclubs are great, but keep in mind that sometimes you have to go off the grid to have a dance with nature.Truth #6: You will lose thingsRight when you think you don’t need something, you do, and it’s not there. I’m talking insect repellent. I’m talking earbuds. I’m talking that sweet as jasmine perfume you haven’t worn because you haven’t been trying to impress anyone and suddenly you just want one spritz of it for your own pleasure.Of course there are the seriously important things to triple check for – like your passport, tickets, keys and wallet – but everything else is only worth a shrug. I packed a purse, backpack and duffel bag for my trip. Within a week I was tired of hauling the big, yellow duffel around. Unfortunately, it was a vintage tennis bag – very painful to part with – and I might’ve cried “Wilson!” yet it was a literal weight off my shoulders once I dropped the duffel bag into a donation bin.In the long run, it’s more important to keep track of a diary than to worry about having those designer shoes. Besides, the feel of organic earth under your bare feet is incomparable.Truth #7: You will find thingsStep outside your front door and there’s a whole world of wonders just waiting to be discovered. I found a wharf where the stingrays played in Picton. I found an apple whiskey that tasted like sunshine in Sydney. I saw the glowworms sparkling like little blue stars in the Waitomo Caves. I even danced around a lighthouse to celebrate the life of a deceased Maori elder in Cape Reinga. It’s so important to try new things – foods, traditions, tours and perspectives. Even though your water spins down the drain in a clockwise direction, halfway around the world in the southern hemisphere it spins the opposite way.Bonus Truth: You will realize that it’s not all about youThere are billions of people, millions of species, and thousands of mosquitoes on this planet. Whether you travel or not, the world will continue to turn. Time will continue to burn. There is one thing that makes it all worthwhile. Love. The discovery of it time and again – in yourself, in others, and in the most unexpected and exciting ways – that’s the adventure!Truth be told, everything will not go according to plan. Go anyway."

Bush and is often referred to as the architect of the Iraq War, says he may vote for Hillary Clinton.Wolfowitz told the German newspaper Der Spiegel he might vote for the Democratic nominee because of the threat Donald Trump poses to U.S. security.“The only way you can be comfortable about Trump’s foreign policy, is to think he doesn’t really mean anything he says. That’s a pretty uncomfortable place to be in,” he said. “Our security depends on having good relationships with our allies. Trump mainly shows contempt for them. And he seems to be unconcerned about the Russian aggression in Ukraine. By doing this he tells them that they can go ahead and do what they are doing. That is dangerous.”“I wish there were somebody I could be comfortable voting for. I might have to vote for Hillary Clinton, even though I have big reservations about her,” he added.Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have spoken warmly of each other in public. Last month, Trump urged Russia to hack Clinton’s email, and has suggested he would not automatically defend members of NATO ― something that could invite aggression from Russia.Paul Manafort, the former chair of Trump’s campaign, also resigned last week after the Associated Press reported on his work on behalf of pro-Russian forces in Ukraine.Wolfowitz is part of a number of Republicans who have refused to back Trump. It’s a list that includes former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft.In an interview with The Los Angeles Times last month, Wolfowitz said America’s credibility in the world would be undermined if Trump was elected.“It’s the fact that our friends aren’t going to trust us and our enemies aren’t going to fear us,” he said.Wolfowitz, who served as a foreign policy adviser on the presidential campaign of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, said in 2003 that the United States would be greeted as liberators in Iraq.Trump has attacked Clinton for voting to support the Iraq war in 2002 and claimed he was against it. Trump’s claim is false ― he did support the invasion.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
40,SPORTS,Why Colin Kaepernick Refused To Stand For The National Anthem Before A 49ers Preseason Game,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-black-lives-matter_us_57c1a1bde4b085c1ff299efd,"""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" the quarterback said.",2016-08-27,San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick (7) throws the ball against the New York Giants in the second quarter at MetLife Stadium.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c1a63e1600002900bfed9b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the playing of the national anthem before the team’s Friday night preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, and on Saturday, he explained why.“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick told NFL.com’s Steve Wyche. “To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”The protest makes Kaepernick the latest athlete to use his platform to call attention to problems facing African-Americans across the country, particularly the issue of police killings. Four NBA stars ― Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Chris Paul ― called attention to the issue in an on-stage speech at the ESPY Awards in July. Anthony has also marched in protests in Baltimore; and Wade and James, along with their then-Miami Heat teammates, donned hoodies to protest the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2013.Players from three WNBA teams wore shirts that bore the “Black Lives Matter” slogan during pre-game warmups in July. And during previous seasons, an assortment of NFL and NBA players have warmed up in T-shirts honoring African-Americans killed by police, and spoken out against police brutality after their games.Kaepernick did not tell the 49ers of his plans not to stand for the anthem. He also sat through the song during a previous preseason game.“This is not something that I am going to run by anybody,” Kaepernick told NFL.com. “I am not looking for approval. I have to stand up for people that are oppressed. ... If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.”Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the anthem is similar to a protest from former Denver Nuggets player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, whose choice to sit down through the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” before NBA games in 1996 blew up into a nationwide controversy. Abdul-Rauf, a converted Muslim, eventually served a one-game suspension before striking a compromise with the NBA that required him to stand but allowed him to bow his head in prayer during the anthem. The flag, Abdul-Rauf said then, was “a symbol of tyranny, of oppression.”The Nuggets traded Abdul-Rauf after the 1996 season, and his career never rebounded from the controversy. The 49ers said that they respected Kaepernick’s decision to exercise his rights of expression.“The National Anthem is and always will be a special part of the pre-game ceremony,” the team said in a statement, according to NFL.com. “It is an opportunity to honor our country and reflect on the great liberties we are afforded as its citizens. In respecting such American principles as freedom of religion and freedom of expression, we recognize the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem.”"

Communicating via email and voice recordings, which were delayed 20 minutes to simulate communication in deep space, the HI-SEAS crew shared everything from personal hardships and plans for the future to the realization that humans are capable of anything.Since entering the habitat on Aug. 28 of last year, HI-SEAS members have only been allowed to venture outside while dressed in full spacesuits.In the hustle and bustle of everyday life on Earth, a year can seem to fly by. But isolate yourself to a 1,000-square-foot dome on rocky terrain 8,200 feet above sea level ― or perhaps in the future, in a small habitat on Mars ― and one might expect time to drag on. Luckily, the NASA-funded mission kept the HI-SEAS crew busy with a rigorous daily schedule of scientific research, geological field work, equipment testing, cooking, exercise and much more.Crew Commander Carmel Johnston said so much happens on simulated Mars that at times “you are just trying to keep your head above water.”The idea that the team has been up there an entire year, Gifford added, is “almost absurd.”“It doesn’t feel like a year, I think that’s the strangest part. It feels like we’ve been here a few months,” she said, adding a person’s sense of time progresses completely differently.That’s not to say the last 12 months have been a breeze. Beyond obvious things, like missing fresh food and the wind on your face, time away from Earth presents enormous emotional challenges. And that’s one of the main goals of the simulated journey: to better understand the risks associated with space travel, including conflict, stress and depression.For example, Gifford’s grandmother died about a month ago. Although her death was expected, Gifford said not being there for her family was extremely difficult. “I said goodbye to my grandmother over a delayed video message,” she told HuffPost. “That’s not something any of us ever want to do. So simply not being on Earth, I think everyone would agree, is the most challenging part of space.”Johnston said she struggled with the “out of sight, out of mind” treatment she received from people who she expected would stay in touch. “We changed everything about our lives and limited ourselves to only communicating by email,” she said. “If anyone didn’t want to hop on that wagon, we just didn’t hear from them this year. It can be pretty disheartening to feel like you are missing out on everything happening at home.”Tristan Bassingthwaighte, the crew architect, told HuffPost he often felt “bored to death.” Other times he just wanted to be alone, to find a place to get away.“A person can be totally cool one minute and severely annoying the next,” he said in an email. “The little things people do that you’d never notice in real life can make you think about tripping them on the stairs here.”Ultimately, it’s how they dealt with such situations and interacted with one another that’s of interest to NASA, which hopes to send astronauts to Mars at some point in the 2030s. Using cameras, body movement trackers and electronic surveys, researchers gathered data on a wide range of cognitive, social and emotional factors that could affect team performance during an extended mission to Mars.Surprisingly, the crew said that at no point did they ever feel like giving up, leaving their false, faraway world to return to Earthling life. When they did get bored or had down time, they found ways to keep busy. An avid reader, Bassingthwaighte said books were his “little doors to worlds that aren’t this one.” He’s also been working on Doctor of Architecture degree and learned to cook with the limited resources he has available. He lost 20 pounds while in the habitat. Gifford, who also served as crew journalist, published numerous online articles, including several blogs for HuffPost.The big question moving forward is what researchers can learn from the mission. The crew itself has no doubts that their sacrifices will help humans reach Mars.“With all the good and the bad comes lessons that you can’t learn unless you are in isolation,” Johnston wrote. “Every success or failure is still data and an outcome that can be used to improve the lives of astronauts and Martians.”“We still need to make the ships and bases (Looking at you SpaceX, I’m available) and understanding this will help us make them right,” Bassingthwaighte wrote. “After that, a little time and effort and we’ll have people on Mars in no time.”Counting down to their so-called “re-entry,” the crew had their sights set on everyday things we Earthlings take for granted ― hugging loved ones, feasting on a burger, swimming in the ocean and running on grass. In addition to spending time with family and getting outside, Bassingthwaighte’s said he’s looking forward to living in a place with a window. “I mean holy crap! A whole window that belongs just to me?” he wrote. “I don’t even know what to do with that, we’ve all been sharing a window the size of a medium pizza for the last year.”In her time away, Gifford said she’s come to realize that the journey to Mars will likely prove more challenging in ways we don’t expect than in ways we do. The good news, she said, is “human beings are pretty much capable of anything.” There’s one other point that Bassingthwaighte said he wants to clear up once and for all: The HI-SEAS crew is not actually on Mars, and they are not being sent to Mars.“You’d be amazed at how many people don’t get that,” he wrote.

But never in public. In public Pola parades around acting cool until she walks into closets and bumps into walls ― still, she considers that a better alternative than being seen wearing glasses.It was in primary school when my eyesight started to fail me and I found I needed glasses. I rebelled against the thought of being shortsighted by using my newfound condition as an excuse to submit messy and careless work. Being told by my teacher I had to sit in the front row to see was a difficult realization to accept. What followed was a trip to the eye specialist with mom and an afternoon spent choosing frames. My first pair were round and navy blue with spots. The pairs to follow in my teens were just as sexy.I made changes to my appearance in my mid-20s once I could afford the costly laser vision correction surgery. I conducted research, read articles to prepare myself, yet I was scared. There were two options: the procedure where they slice a layer of your eye or the one where they zap your eye for a few seconds. My eyes were suited to the latter procedure, and I decided to have both my eyes done at the same time ― the sooner the better. My parents drove me home after surgery as I was unable to see anything but a blur and wore eye patches. I spent a few weeks in bed and my mother helped to constantly apply drops to my eyes so that they did not dry up and reverse the surgery.All this because I didn’t feel attractive wearing glasses.Two weeks ago I was back at Spec Savers selecting new frames. Ten years since my surgery and I’ve been struggling to see tram stops, supermarket isle signs and lights while driving at night. Even my own film on the big screen seemed blurred and bad quality. As I squinted my eyes and shuffled closer to the screen I noticed my eyes that were the problem, not the TV or the DVD quality. What I had been denying the last few months was true; I needed glasses again for long distance, driving, and watching screens. I made and appointment for an eye check and a week later I picked up my frames just before I was due to meet a client to shoot a promo video. I popped them on and smiled all the way to the gig. I loved the look of my Love Moschino frames on my face ― I felt attractive and interesting. Glasses can show your personality through the frames style you choose plus make you look mysterious.But I’ve never understood TV, film and advertising making a connection with wearing glasses to nerds or educated people. Nerds don’t choose to wear glasses to look smart or fit in, people who wear glasses are shortsighted or have cataracts and need them to see. Surprise! You don’t become super smart once you put glasses on.The fantasy of the hot librarian who prances around in her tight pencil skirt, unpins her bun and throws her glasses off to reveal a goddess in waiting annoys me too. This female character stereotype is was always easy to spot – Cameron Diaz as Elizabeth Hasley from Bad Teacher or the not so easy to spot Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle/Catwoman from 1992’s Batman Returns.Thinking back to growing up wearing glasses and the female characters who, like myself wore glasses on TV shows, in movies or cartoons, they were mostly the nerd of the group or duo ―-Velma Dinkley from Scooby-Doo, Enid from Ghost World and Natalie from House Bunny fit the stereotype well. The popular girls however do not wear glasses and the boys are not attentive to the girls who did, unless they were transformed into beautiful swans, sans spectacles- Mia Thermopolis from The Princess Diaries is a strong example.On rare occasions the quirky girl wearing glasses is the lead character given kooky, individual traits which in turn make her fun and interesting, as demonstrated by Zooey Deschanel playing teacher Jess Day in New Girl. My favorite girl with glasses is Daria, in the cartoon of the same name. She’s the lead and the show is based around Daria’s dry humor and her cynical nature justified by teen angst. Daria is the nerd who refuses to fit in and often makes fun of her popular sister, who is written as the classic American ‘it’ girl.As expected most portrayals of the smart female character with glasses show her as a conservative secretary, teacher or a scientist. Amy Farrah Fowler from The Big Bang Theory is a neurobiologist and in Legally Blonde 2 Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a law student donning glasses in an attempt to look smart, feeding the idea that glasses do that for you and people take you seriously with glasses.How to Marry a Millionaire ends with Pola discovering that men are attentive to girls who wear glasses after landing a man who informs her that the statement is redundant. What I enjoyed about Pola was that she wasn’t the typical stereotype of a girl wearing glasses ― she was an attractive model among model friends, she wasn’t smart but she was physically desirable and funny.Maybe since that 1953 film, portrayals of female stereotypes with glasses have been inflated to the extent of totally predictable making characters written easier for the viewer to identify as a nerd or popular person. If you ask me it’s a cope out. Show me female superheros and sex workers wearing glasses and show me athletes or rock chicks wearing glasses leading bands ― just don’t show me any more librarians and scientists with glasses or teachers ― it’s been done to death and us spectacle wearers deserve better."

Jeremiah Wright's generation raised amid racial segregation still bear. He addressed ""a similar anger'' among white Americans who've worked hard yet ""feel their dreams slipping away"" only to see ""an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed...  ""Opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense,'' candidate Obama said in Philadelphia, in March 2008, with words that still apply near the close of his second term. ""This is where we are right now. It's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years. Contrary to the claims of some of my critics, black and white, I have never been so naïve as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle, or with a single candidacy -- particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own.""  The president, his public job approval riding above 50 percent in his final year, will return to Philadelphia in September, this time campaigning for his intra-party rival in that 2008 campaign, Hillary Clinton, immersed now in countervailing accusations of bigotry and racism in a contest with Republican Donald Trump.""From the start, Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia,'' Clinton said in a multi-faceted assault on Trump's lack of character or qualification for the nation's highest office delivered this week in Reno. ""He's taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over one of America's two major political parties,'' she said of ""a man with a long history of racial discrimination, who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far reaches of the Internet.""   And with the hiring of campaign CEO Stephen Bannon, publisher of the breitbart.com site favored by the ""Alt-Right"" -- which the Wall Street Journal describes as a mostly online movement that ""rejects mainstream conservatism, promotes nationalism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity"" -- Clinton suggested that ""the de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump campaign represents a landmark achievement for the Alt-Right. A fringe element has effectively taken over the Republican Party.""  ""It's the oldest play in the Democratic playbook,'' Trump complained in his own attempt at a prebuttal in Manchester, N.H., before Clinton's address in Nevada. ""When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument: 'You're racist, you're racist, you're racist.' It's a tired disgusting argument.""  For a couple of weeks now, in an attempt to convince moderate swing voters that he is not a racist, Trump has made an odd appeal to African American voters who tend to vote 9-1 Democratic in presidential contests: ""What the Hell have you got to lose?"" It's Clinton, he contends, who views black Americans simply as votes to be won, and he argues that for generations ""millions of African-American and Hispanic-American citizens... have been betrayed by Democratic policies.""  Yet this war of words is not merely another manifestation of the ""racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years,'' as Obama put it. Some contend that the reporting of the week's cross-fire between the candidates -- which continues on Twitter and will loom large in the Sunday morning talk shows -- is actually purveying a ""false equivalency."" The idea here is that Clinton actually possesses far more ammunition in her case against Trump than he holds in his claim that she's ""a bigot.""  And it's no coincidence that Trump is launching his first appeal to minorities at a juncture in which Clinton has gained a double-digit lead in some national polls.  ""I think Trump is fairly desperate at this point and to a certain extent has painted himself into a corner,'' says Carl Tobias, professor of law at the University of Richmond. ""His outreach to African Americans seems to ring hollow, and once Obama is out there talking, that is sure to help Clinton in a lot of ways, certainly with that constituency.""  In a contest dominated by two of the most unpopular nominees in the history of modern opinion polling, there may be little gain for either in a debate on racism.""I think everybody all the way around is going to hold their noses and vote, which is unfortunate,"" Tobias says. ""I think people almost stop listening at this point. I don't know where the high ground is, but nobody seems to be on it.""  Trump arrived at this fight with a history of questionable acts and remarks. In November 2014, the Twitter aficionado tweeted this about the president: ""Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!"" Asked by ABC News' Jonathan Karl at the time what he meant by that, Trump said: ""He has set a very poor standard. I think that he has set a very low bar and I think it's a shame for the African American people... And by the way, he has done nothing for African Americans.""  Before that, Trump was among the highest-profile and most vocal proponents of the rumor that Obama is not a naturally born American citizen. Clinton running mate Tim Kaine, campaigning on the campus of historically black Florida A&M University the day after the Trump-Clinton exchange over racism, said: ""Donald Trump was a main guy behind the scurrilous, and I would say bigoted, notion that President Obama wasn't even born in this country.""  The actual accusation of racism reached its highest volume in the campaign underway after Trump accused the federal judge handling a lawsuit alleging fraud at Trump University of bias because he's ""a Mexican"" and Trump wants to build a border wall against illegal immigration. It was the Republican Party's own House Speaker Paul Ryan who delivered the strongest rebuke of Trump's remark about Judge Gonzalo Curiel, a Mexican-American born in Indiana who has fought Mexican drug cartels as a prosecutor. Ryan said: ""Claiming a person can't do their job is sort of the like the textbook definition of a racist comment.""Trump also has seized upon some stray Clinton comments to make his case for bigotry. ""Hillary Clinton needs to address the racist undertones of her 2008 campaign,'' he tweeted to his 11 million followers on Friday, offering a video montage of news clippings. In one, Clinton is pictured on an old episode of NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" delivering a speech in which she said: ""Dr. King's dream began to be realized when President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act."" In that clip, it's the late host Tim Russert who suggests to Clinton: ""It's as if you are minimizing, 'I have a dream.' It's a nice sentiment, but it took a white president to get blacks to the mountaintop."" The comment goes unanswered by Clinton.  It was during her contest against Obama in the 2008 Democratic primaries that Clinton suggested that Obama is an eloquent speaker lacking a record of action and it's proven political leaders who've brought about real change. ""I would point to the fact that that Dr. King's dream began to be realized when President Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, when he was able to get through Congress something that President Kennedy was hopeful to do, the president before had not even tried, but it took a president to get it done,'' she said. ""That dream became a reality, the power of that dream became real in people's lives because we had a president who said we are going to do it and actually got it accomplished.""  Obama was forced to deny that his campaign was circulating the remark to rally black voters. ""Senator Clinton made an unfortunate remark, an ill-advised remark, about King and Lyndon Johnson. I didn't make the statement,"" Obama told reporters. ""I haven't remarked on it, and she, I think, offended some folks who felt that somehow diminished King's role in bringing about the Civil Rights Act. She is free to explain that, but the notion that somehow this is our doing is ludicrous.""  Trump is playing another remark attributed third-hand and without direct quotation to Bill Clinton. Two years after that 2008 campaign, in their book Game Change, John Heilemann and Mark Halperin reported about the former president attempting to convince Sen. Ted Kennedy to support Hillary Clinton. ""Bill then went on, belittling Obama in a manner that deeply offended Kennedy. Recounting the conversation later to a friend, Teddy fumed that Clinton had said, A few years ago, this guy would have been getting us coffee,"" the authors wrote. In the years since, the comment relayed by an unidentified someone who purported to hear it from the one who claimed to hear it from Clinton has been repeated in media accounts as an alleged direct quote.  Then there is the business of the ""super predators,"" which Trump is replaying online. ""How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth SUPER PREDATORS' -- has she apologized?"" Trump tweeted this week. In the 1990s, after President Clinton won passage of the Violent Crime Control Act, the first lady warned in a 1996 speech of ""the kinds of kids that are called 'super predators...' no conscience, no empathy, we can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel."" In this year's Democratic primaries, Bernie Sanders took issue with the remark: ""It was a racist term,'' he said in their final debate, ""and everybody knew it was a racist term."" Clinton later allowed: ""I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today.""""The Clinton's are the real predators,"" Trump has tweeted.For her part, Clinton claims Trump has demeaned the African American community with his portrayal of black neighborhoods as ""war zones.""""He doesn't see the success of black leaders in every field... the vibrancy of black-owned businesses... or the strength of the black church,'' she said in Reno. ""He doesn't see the excellence of historically black colleges and universities or the pride of black parents watching their children thrive...And he certainly doesn't have any solutions to take on the reality of systemic racism and create more equity and opportunity in communities of color.''  She has reached far back into the billionaire's own business career to portray a record of racism. ""When Trump was getting his start in business, he was sued by the Justice Department for refusing to rent apartments to black and Latino tenants,'' she said. ""Their applications would be marked with a ""C"" -- ""C"" for ""colored"" -- and then rejected.""  The New York Times reports that the legacy of discrimination in Trump housing developments started with the developer's father. In the 1960s, as Civil Rights legislation was advancing in Washington, the Times reports: ""Over the next decade, as Donald Trump assumed an increasingly prominent role in the business, the company's practice of turning away potential black tenants was painstakingly documented by activists and organizations that viewed equal housing as the next frontier in the civil rights struggle. The Justice Department undertook its own investigation and, in 1973, sued Trump Management for discriminating against blacks. Both Fred Trump, the company's chairman, and Donald Trump, its president, were named as defendants. ""Absolutely ridiculous,"" the son said.""When it was over,'' The Times reports today, ""Mr. Trump declared victory, emphasizing that the consent decree he ultimately signed did not include an admission of guilt."" But the paper's investigation -- ""drawing on decades-old files from the New York City Commission on Human Rights, internal Justice Department records, court documents and interviews with tenants, civil rights activists and prosecutors -- uncovered a long history of racial bias at his family's properties, in New York and beyond.""  ""It takes a lot of nerve to ask people he's ignored and mistreated for decades, 'What do you have to lose?'"" Clinton said this week. ""The answer is everything!""  Clinton went on to enumerate the support Trump has attracted from white nationalists such as David Duke, whose backing Trump took some time to disavow. She spoke of Trump's plans for a religious test for Muslims entering the United States -- a requirement to disavow Sharia law. ""Under Donald Trump, America would distinguish itself as the only country in the world to impose a religious test at the border,'' she said. ""Come to think of it, there actually may be one place that does that. It's the so-called Islamic State.''  And finally, Clinton says, Trump's campaign is being run by the publisher of a platform, Breitbart, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as embracing ""ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right. Racist ideas. Race-baiting ideas. Anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideas -- all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the 'Alt-Right.'""""There's an old Mexican proverb that says, 'Tell me with whom you walk, and I will tell you who you are,'' Clinton said. ""We know who Trump is. A few words on a teleprompter won't change that. He says he wants to 'make America great again,' but his real message remains 'Make America hate again.""'Clinton has taken the fight to campaign ads, including the newest about losing ""everything.""  Obama, who plans to campaign for Clinton in Philadelphia on Sept. 13, went there in March 2008 to disavow the comments of a pastor he'd known for years -- while standing by the man himself and offering a social context for his sentiments.This time, Obama plans to speak of Clinton's ideas for improving the economy. But his words from 2008 still resonate today.""Race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now,'' he said then. ""We would be making the same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons about America -- to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality.''Ironically, Obama in 2008 took a turn at describing the very electorate to whom Trump has appealed in his own campaign for president this year:""Most working- and middle-class white Americans don't feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race,'' Obama said then. ""Their experience is the immigrant experience -- as far as they're concerned, no one handed them anything. They built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pensions dumped after a lifetime of labor. They are anxious about their futures, and they feel their dreams slipping away...  ""Just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze -- a corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices and short-term greed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that favor the few over the many,"" Obama said in Philadelphia. ""And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns -- this too widens the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding."""

Photo: ZEALnycMark McLaren, Editor in Chief, ZEALnyc August 27, 2016Last week, the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal and its music director Kent Nagano concluded a marathon four-day music festival that attracted some of classical music's brightest stars and well over 60,000 Canadians in celebration of the city's rich classical music tradition - a tradition grounded, it seems, in the city's symphony orchestra.""It's very important for us, especially here in Montreal where we have such an enthusiastic audience, such a faithful audience, to go out and really play directly to the public,"" says OSM music director Kent Nagano. ""Over the last five years, the OSM Couche-Tard Classical Spree has enjoyed a steadily growing success,"" reports OSM chief executive officer Madeleine Careau, and attendance at over forty concerts held at Montreal's Place des Arts grew this year to over 30,000. This support, in addition to an audience of over 30,000 at Montreal's Olympic Park that opened the festival, suggests that the city of Montreal does, in fact, maintain a special relationship with its home-town orchestra. OSM music director Kent Nagano. Photo: Wilfred Hösl/International Classical ArtistsThe OSM began its festival at Montreal's Olympic Park with Galaxy of Heroes, an outdoor concert celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Montreal Olympic games and featuring popular orchestral fare from Holst, Mussorgsky, and Wagner accompanying live athletic performances and vintage footage from the '76 olympic games.The festival moved to downtown the following day with the debut of an electro-acoustic work by composer Robert Normandeau celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Montreal metro. Organist Philippe Bélanger followed with an impressive (and crowd-pleasing) improvised soundtrack to the silent film For Heaven's Sake, playing OSM's newly gifted Grand Orgue Pierre-Béique at Maison Symphonique.The next two days were filled with an ear-staggering collection of concerts, large and small, in four different Place des Arts venues. Violinst Pinchas Zukerman and pianist Nelson Freire headlined, joining the OSM for orchestral fare (Bruch, Milhaud, Mozart) and solo recitals (Freire offered a particularly intimate peak at the Brahms Piano Sonata no. 3 in F minor op. 5 at Place des Arts' Cinquième Salle). The OSM played multiple concerts of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony featuring a quartet of Canadian vocalists and the utterly accomplished OSM Chorus. It wrapped the festival with a rare performance of Saint-Saëns Organ Symphony which again featured the new Casavant organ (Op. 3900) at Maison Symphonique.And throughout in chamber ensembles and small recitals, a host of today's exciting (truly) and leading musicians marched through Place des Arts. The young and gifted German violinist Arabella Steinbacher led a performance of Brahms' Quintet for Piano and Strings in F minor, op. 34 and thrilled with Prokofiev. The vivacious Avi Avital, the world's leading classical mandolinist, played Vivaldi and Beethoven in both solo recital and with OSM. Spanish cellist Adolfo Gutiérrez Arenas played Schumann and Chopin with Canadian pianist Charles Richard-Hamelin and Franck and Piazzolla with pianist Suzanne Blondin. New York pianist Gille Vonsattel brought gravitas to Vivaldi, Beethoven, and Debussy and offered a compelling partner to Ms. Steinbacher in Prokoviev and Mozart. OSM concertmaster Andrew Wan and other OSM instrumentalists appeared frequently, as did the National Youth Orchestra of Canada.OSM's Couche-Tard Virée Classique is a pretty impressive undertaking - some remarkable music-making over the course of a very short time. At its most intense, my listening began with Vivaldi at 10:30am, and concluded with Saint-Saëns at 11:00pm. Between were impressive performances that delighted the ear.The following are short reviews and excerpts of select OSM Couche-Tard Virée Classique performances.__________For Heaven's Sake with Improvised Organ Soundtrack by Philippe BélangerIn an interview with ZEALnyc moments before he began his performance, organist Philippe Bélanger claimed that, like his audience, he had ""no idea what he would hear"" during an improvised soundtrack to the silent film For Heaven's Sake. I suspect this is a bit of showmanship on the part of Bélanger, who accompanied the film from Maison Symphonique on the newly gifted Casavant (Op. 3900) Grand Orgue Pierre-Béique. Whether Mr. Bélanger's performance was truly improvised or carefully planned, it was unarguably thrilling. The improvised soundtrack, taking its cue from the film, was nicely shaped, entertaining, and at its moments of conflict, compelling. Mr. Bélanger reports that accompanying For Heaven's Sake, which clocks in at just under one hour, is a relatively simple task when compared to the lengthier Ben Hur (over two and a half hours) which, with its long chariot race, is particularly popular with silent movie audiences.Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal Beethoven Ninth Symphony, Kent Nagano ConductingOSM played multiple performances of Beethoven's popular symphony, offering a showcase not only for the orchestra and its relatively new Maison Symphonique, but for a quartet of skilled Canadian vocalists and the very fine Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal Chorus. Nagano drove the performance with characteristic passion and detail, and the OSM retains its exciting sound in its home (I had last heard them at Carnegie Hall, ""a sound with tremendous polish but little varnish, and the result is exciting""). Exciting also was to hear the fine OSM Chorus, with a sound that is also polished with impressive diction and a passion to meet its orchestral partner. The Maison Symphonique provides an arresting environment for the chorus, with lighting that cinematically highlights individual choristers. (I suspect that this lighting was working on stage left, but not on stage right on the evening of August 12.) And while the chorus placement is visually impressive, the distance from the house makes the choral sound slightly remote. This is a small complaint, and both the OSM and its chorus offered a superb performance of this orchestral favorite.Johannes Brahms Quintet for Piano and Strings in F minor, op. 34Performances outside of Maison Symphonique began impressively at Place des Arts' Cinquième Salle with a touching performance of Brahms' grand masterpiece. Young German violin sensation Arabella Steinbacher began the first of three Virée Classique appearances leading an intimately sublime performance with Andrew Wan (violin), Neal Gripp (viola), Adolfo Gutiérrez Arenas (cello), and pianist Gille Vonsattel. The small hall provided the listener with close look at both the work of this impressive roster of individual players and the ensemble, in a reading that was nicely shaped and texturally rich.Viva Vivaldi! with Pinchas Zukerman, OSM and GuestsIn a star-studded morning concert, the biggest star of this salute to Vivaldi may have been Maison Symphonique itself, which with its rich wood interior and oscillating curved walls, is an impressively happy environment for the smaller forces of baroque ensembles. Within the relatively large space, the sound of the morning's smaller ensembles danced deep in the middle of the hall, providing a sound that while nicely blended, brought the appearance that the performers were considerably closer to the ear than their actual physical distance. OSM chief operating officer Marie-Josée Desrochers says that this particular acoustic effect has influenced programming in future seasons, with next year's highlighting the symphonies of Haydn.On this morning, Vivaldi did indeed live. Both pianist Gille Vonsattel and cellist Amanda Forsyth gave sure accounts of his music for keyboard and cello. Of particular charm was mandolinist Avi Avital, who brought a plucky reading of Vivaldi's Violin Concerto in A minor RV 356 adapted for mandolin. Mr. Avital is the world's leading classical mandolinist, and hearing him perform, it is hard to believe that the instrument won't become a standard guest in concert halls, just as the guitar joined its ranks several decades ago. Mr. Avital's playing is secure and exciting with sure tuning and powerful interpretive instincts - both sensitive and spunky. Look for Mr. Avital at a concert hall near you - very soon.Steinbacher and Vonsattel play Mozart & ProkofievBoth outstanding soloists returned to the intimate Cinquiéme Salle for an impressive recital of violin and piano. It may have been just past noon, but following Mozart's Violin and Piano Sonata no. 18 in G major, K. 301, the duo performed an impassioned reading of Prokofiev's Violin and Piano Sonata no. 1 in F minor, op. 80. In an interview with ZEALnyc, Steinbacher reveals that Prokofiev and Shostakovich are composers particularly close to her heart, and this reading of Prokofiev, played on the 300 year old Booth Stradivarius which has been her performing instrument for over a decade, cast no doubt as to her understanding of this music. Steinbacher plays with both technical acumen and lovely passion. Her technique is both nimble and secure, and she pulls from her instrument a huge range of sound, all securely grounded in tuning and tone. Her interprative pallette is equally reaching - she plays Mozart with as much intention as she does the often emotionally wrenching music of Prokofiev. Superstars reign in classical music, and look for Steinbacher (following Perlman, Bell, Mutter, Zukerman) to join this list very soon. In Vonsattel, she found a happy partner who plays with impressive skills of his own and empathetic sensitivity.Spanish Cellist Adolof Gutiérrez Arenas plays Franck and Piazzolla  The young Spanish cellist Adolfo Gutiérrez Arenas made several appearances at OSM's Couche-Tard Virée Classique including an early and successful collaboration with Arabella Steinbacher, Andrew Wan, neal Gripp, and Gilles Vonsattel in a compelling performance of the Brahms Quintet for Piano and Strings in F minor, op. 34. Later, he joined pianists Charles Richard-Hamelin and Suzanne Blondin for duo recitals. With Blondin, he played Franck's monumental Violin Sonata in A Major (cello version) and Astor Piazzolla's Le grand tango. At this stage, Arenas' sound isn't huge, but it is expressive - important for the work of both Franck and Piazzolla. His tuning is a tad rich (though more contained in the Brahms earlier in the week) and his heartfelt interpretation of Franck suffered slightly as a result. His interpretation of Piazzolla, on the other hand, was as moving as it was accurate. Look for this talented soloist down the road.Camille Saint-Saëns with OSM and Kent NaganoThe final concert of the festival again featured the Maison Symphonique's organ, now in a night of orchestral music by Camille Saint-Saëns. OSM has spent time with the composer of late, last year recording his three violin concertos with OSM concert master Andrew Wan as soloist. Saint-Saëns Tarentelle for Flute, Clarinet and Orchestra op. 6 began the festival's final performance and featured OSM principals Timothy Hutchins (flute) and Todd Cope (clarinet).But frankly, the star of the night was, again, the Maison Symphonique and its Grand Orgue Pierre-Béique. More about these two.The Maison Symphonique was inaugurated in 2011. With a seating capacity of 2,100, 70% of its interior is finished in blond wood, fostering a warmth of sound and a visually cool, modern interior. European seating in the house, though perhaps inconvenient to concert-goers, creates a uniform visual line in the hall while chorus seating behind the stage mirrors the seating levels within the house. This stage seating builds to a dramatic reveal of the organ, the pipes of which (the largest playfully inverted as they hang from the ceiling) act as frame and proscenium to the stage below.Inaugurated in 2014 and at a reported cost of $4 million, Maison Symphonique's Grand Orgue Pierre-Bélanger is the product of the French organ builder Casavant and includes nearly 6,500 pipes. The organ was donated by Jacqueline Desmarais as a tribute to OSM's founder and first general manager who ran the OSM from 1939 to 1970. Many a U.S. concert hall looks to electronic instruments these days to fulfill organ needs, and it is a stark reminder of the Montreal's European personality that, in such a time and at such an expense, this organ was commissioned and installed. The organ console sits dramatically high over the stage, producing more visual excitement in the hall as the organist reigns over proceedings, while at the same time engulfed by the instrument he plays. Organist Jean-Willy Kunz Grand Orgue Pierre Béique at Maison Symphonique, Montreal Canada August 13, 2016. Photo: ZEALnycAnd over the course of OSM's Virée Classique, the Grand Orgue established itself as a truly fine instrument. Distinctly flexible at the hands of Philippe Bélanger earlier in the week, with Saint-Saëns the organ demonstrated its subtlety. The composer's Organ Symphony is by no means a concerto - the instrument is not featured as a solo instrument. Rather, it acts as another orchestral 'section' adding new tonal color, and in this case an excitingly rich palette. Organist Jean-Willy Kunz is masterful in his registration choices, and the organ acted as a delightful community member - adding a compelling non-orchestral color without dominating. The first of the organ entrances was sublime - soft, delicate strings blended with the orchestra to create an utterly unique sound - a sound that beat in waves. As the piece moved toward completion, its chordal language moved to that of the organ, which rose appropriately to the dominant color.Throughout, OSM's unique sound thrilled. Their strings are firm, emphatic and beautiful. The brass and winds, proud and confident. The balance among this youthful collection of musicians is spot on, but it is a balance in which individual components maintain a bright presence. In an era when individual sounds among orchestras become rare, OSM under the leadership of Kent Nagano is a happy exception.Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal adds a rare new orchestral instrument to its family in October.

Lucky Mwachi,  Join the Pipe, Nairobi, KenyaIt's hard to imagine 400,000 people using a single park on a daily basis. Yet in Uhuru park in Nairobi, this is far from extraordinary. However, until recently people using the park were forced to either drink contaminated water, or, if they were wealthy enough, to purchase bottled water. The Join The Pipe project is changing that with the installation of a drinking water station which will provide clean and safe water that is affordable for everyone while also reducing the plastic bottle waste which plagues the park. It is projects like this that will bring clean water to the 56% of people in Kenya who currently lack access.Samuel Cadet and Winter Luc,   Plantons pour le futur!, Cite Soleil, Port au Prince, Ouest, HaitiFollowing the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the sprawling slum of Cité Soleil was badly afflicted by cholera, and remains heavily polluted and lacking essential infrastructure.

Working on issues like local food production and food security, clean water access, protecting biodiversity with indigenous seeds and plants, and raising the next generation of youth environmental leaders- our latest Youth Environmental Grants paint a picture of young leaders re-imagining what it takes to build resilient and sustainable communities from the grassroots up. Stay tuned - our team is still out there making grants as you read this!Elson-n Auquel,  Agri-venture Savanette, Savanette, HaitiAfter seeing sustainable agriculture replaced by commercially driven mono-cropping in his native land, Elson-n Auquel recognized that the health of both the people and the land of Haiti were being destroyed by these practices. Determined to reconnect young people to the land by showing them how they can revitalize the health of their communities and Haiti's fertile soils together, he and his team founded  WHYFARM. An interactive, innovative, and fun 2 month 'agri-venture' camp, WHYFARM teaches young people how to produce sustainable, healthy food, while also making growing crops cool again!Valeria Monserrath Ortega Salazar and Lia Deside Villa Salazar,   MONLIB, Reworking Trash To Help Marine Life, Guadalajara, MexicoAlthough so young that they do not yet have a bank account, Valeria and Lia can already see that the thousand tons of trash produced daily by their Metropolitan community in Guadalajara, Mexico, has serious implications for the health of our oceans. Working in community centers and involving their peers, they created  MONLIB, an organization which seeks to reduce the future impact of waste by educating young people about reducing and reusing, while also addressing the current situation with imaginative recycling projects which involve producing jewelry and other crafts from trash.M. Iwan Kurniawan,  Budidaya Tanaman Obat dan Rempah dalam Pelestarian Makanan Tradisional Aceh (Cultivation and Conservation of Herbs and Medicinal Plants for Traditional Food of Aceh, Aceh, IndonesiaIn the lush Northern region of Sumatera in Indonesia, one of the last primary rainforests on earth is facing the threat of deforestation. As the forests are destroyed, so too is the culture of the people who have called them home for generations. Recognizing the deep interconnection between these cultural and environmental catastrophes, biology major M. Iwan Kurniawan came up with a plan that incorporates local knowledge preservation with the conservation of biodiversity within the forests. Seeds will be collected and preserved, and traditional food and medical preparations of plants will be archived and shared on a website so that these precious species and knowledge will not be lost.Irma Patricia Espinoza Magaña,   Eduación Ambiental para Todxs/ Environmental Education for All, Zapopan, MexicoIn the neighborhood of Santa Margarita, in the city of Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico, four passionate women are working to change their streets and schools by inspiring youth to protect and care for the environment. Working with young people who receive little environmental education, The  Environmental Education Project for All is teaching young people environmental stewardship through community gardening, and giving them the skills to carry out an environmental impact assessment of their school - laying the foundation for them to incorporate an environmental perspective throughout the rest of their personal and professional livesPeninah Wangithi Wanjohi,   Dagoretti Market Bio-Latrine Water Kiosk, Nairobi, KenyaAfter successfully revitalizing a public meeting space, Peninah and her team are now set on turning it into a touchstone for environmentally sensitive community driven development in urban Kenya. Through the construction of a latrine block which will produce biogas, and the installation of a water kiosk, they will be bringing essential services and providing clean water to hundreds of people each day who are currently forced to drink dirty and contaminated water from dubious sources. Youth from the community will staff these facilities, providing much needed income and demonstrating that it is possible to lift up communities economically while caring for the environment.Talia Schmitt and Mashaba Rashid,   Eco-Schools Leadership Initiative, Virginia, USAIn Virginia the  Eco--Schools Leadership Initiative is taking a hands-on approach to environmental education in communities who often do not receive exposure to these kinds of lessons. Recognizing that getting kids engaged in problem-solving is the best way to produce young leaders, ESLI partners elementary school students with high school and college mentors to solve environmental problems facing their communities - including things like water sampling and run off reduction. These partnerships are a win-win: the program skillfully weaves the education of very young children with the creation of an emerging cohort of environmental educators. Lucky Mwachi,  Join the Pipe, Nairobi, KenyaIt's hard to imagine 400,000 people using a single park on a daily basis. Yet in Uhuru park in Nairobi, this is far from extraordinary. However, until recently people using the park were forced to either drink contaminated water, or, if they were wealthy enough, to purchase bottled water. The Join The Pipe project is changing that with the installation of a drinking water station which will provide clean and safe water that is affordable for everyone while also reducing the plastic bottle waste which plagues the park. It is projects like this that will bring clean water to the 56% of people in Kenya who currently lack access.Samuel Cadet and Winter Luc,   Plantons pour le futur!, Cite Soleil, Port au Prince, Ouest, HaitiFollowing the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the sprawling slum of Cité Soleil was badly afflicted by cholera, and remains heavily polluted and lacking essential infrastructure. Politically and socially marginalized, youth in this urban neighborhood often struggle to connect with the natural world. Partnering their community garden and school programs, Samuel and Winter seek to rebuild and inspire a connected community of young people who will ensure a better and healthier future for themselves and their country.Dejah Powell,   Get Them to the Green, Chicago, Illinois Get Them to the Green is an organization in Chicago which inspires students from diverse communities to be changemakers and leaders within their communities and beyond. G2G founder Dejah Powell believes that if we want children to protect the planet in the future, then it is essential that they learn to love the environment from an early age. To engage these young environmentalists, G2G runs summer camps and partners with schools to connect them to the beauty of the natural world while showing them how environmental science is taking place all around us.Along with our partners at Levi Strauss & Co., and our global team of grassroots grantmakers, we are so proud to fund these innovative young leaders. Do you have a project that can change the world? We welcome grant applications for Pollination Project seed grants, every day."

Are You Looking For Bingo Or Competitive Tennis On Thursdays?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ac54891700004000bafbcd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"I don't speak Canine. But apparently my 91-year-old mother does. She is closer to her yapping beagle, Chipper, than anyone in the world. She walks him twice a day, cuddles with him on her couch, feeds him from the dinner table and worries about him constantly.She knows exactly how he feels and what he is thinking at all times. During our weekly car ride from her senior apartment to my house, she translates for me his every wish.Chipper yearns for the freedom of backyard so that my mom won't have to walk him every morning. He would love another dog to play with. He wants to live in a house again. He's worried that he may interfere with my life, but he would love to move in with my husband and me. I know these thoughts are my mom's, but it's easier for her to speak to me through the dog. Sometimes I answer her. Sometimes I answer Chipper. Most often I'm answering myself. Because I've had these exact thoughts, the root of which were planted when I was a young girl. My grandfather moved into our home when I was only 8-years-old. At the time my mom was in her thirties. She was in the prime of her life: physically, mentally, spiritually. Having her father-in-law wandering the halls late at night not only dampened her sexual freedom with my father, it changed everything in our lives: Family trips, dinners, pool parties, picnics, bed times, grocery shopping. Where we had been a family of four, we were now five, and the fifth person was not another child, but a grown man, set in his ways and beliefs. He often favored my sister, taking her side whenever we had a fight. To this day I have memories of standing outside his bedroom on the other side of an invisible wall, watching the two of them laughing.But my husband and I are way past our prime, with no desire to run naked down the hallway. Our children our gone. We have the room for my mom and we want nothing more than to help her enjoy the twilight of her life.As Chipper tells my mom -- they are living among the dying. They'd much rather be living among the living. As we near my house, a smile spreads on my mom's face. Chipper becomes so excited, I'm afraid he'll jump onto my foot and press it against the gas pedal. The minute we arrive in the driveway, he licks me in the face. I open the door and he bolts for the front yard. ""Chipper loves your neighborhood,"" my mom says, gazing at my lemon trees and rose bushes. ""That tree is his favorite.""""We love having him,"" I answer. ""He's getting close to making a change."" My mom nods, stares out the window, and I can only imagine where her mind is going. Back in time, perhaps? Or toward the future? Whichever direction, she begins to smile. ""I guess he'll let you know,"" I say as I help her out of the car.""He will,"" she answers. Then again, I may speak Canine by the time Chipper decides to move in and I'll be able to discuss the arrangements with him myself.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"
