""What is wrong with me?"" she wanted to know.This woman was puzzled and upset because she feels that she hasn't done or said anything inappropriate that would trigger their behavior. They hurt her already fragile emotional state. Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon experience. Most people in troubled marriages don't wear their unhappiness on their sleeves for all to see. They often put on a mask that life is grand. It's not that they don't complain from time to time about a certain incident or an aspect of their marriage; it's that overall, outsiders would think they have a happy marriage.When one couple in a circle of friends gets divorced, it sends an emotional shockwave through the group. Those who feel it most are in unhappy marriages themselves, or are struggling with who they are.Your divorce forces them to look at their marriage and say, ""If they were unhappy, maybe we are unhappy too."" They may look at your situation as a threat to their marriage, and they may not be ready to deal with the problems in their marriage. So what they unconsciously do is push away the threat -- you. It's like avoiding that person who has a severe cold because you don't want to get sick yourself.Divorce is a time of transition; a client of mine refers to it as pruning. You'll have friends that will drop off your radar, but you'll also have some whose friendships stand the test of time. Often those people are comfortable in their own skin and if they're married, their marriage is built on a firm foundation and your divorce is no threat to them; they give it no second thought.This is also a time where you will form new friendships. You'll find yourself befriending others who are in similar situations. Divorce is a common bond.Embrace this as part of your new life. As I was making new friendships after divorce, it was validating to know that people wanted to be my friend for who I was; I didn't need to wear my mask anymore. I could stand on my own and be welcomed into the lives of others. You can too."
1,TRAVEL,Tips For Finding A Great Airfare Deal,"Fly.com, Contributor

Travelers still have to put up with packed planes, rising fees and unpredictable security lines, but they are missing fewer business meetings or chances to tuck their kids into bed. Nearly 84 percent of domestic flights arrived within 15 minutes of their schedule time in the first half of the year, the best performance since the government started tracking such data in 1988. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c1d912400003100531433.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For many families Labor Day is synonymous with the end of summer. It represents the last big family holiday before Thanksgiving and, for most school districts, it is the precursor to the start of a new school year. It is also often considered the last chance for a quick summer vacation. With this in mind, and with the cost of flights rising, we thought now might be a good time to share some tips and tricks that will help you find the best airfare deals for Labor Day and beyond.Don't delay Start looking for flights as soon as possible. For holiday travel in particular, the further out you are from your travel dates, the more likely you are to get a good deal.Pick the right day Tuesday and Wednesdays are typically the best days to search for flights because this is when airlines often release their sale fares. Also Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays are normally the cheapest days to fly. Often flying on the actual holiday, rather than the day before or after, can lead to better prices and smaller crowds in the airport.Embrace your impulses If you see a good price, act on it. Airfare prices fluctuate, so the deal you find might be available for only a few hours. For instance, only this week, Fly.com's deal experts discovered a jaw-droppingly low $337 roundtrip flight from New York City to Tel Aviv, Israel. It turned out to be the result of an airline error but, in the three hours that the airfare was available, more than 5,000 tickets were purchased. Be flexible Try to be flexible with your travel dates. Airfare prices are often different from one day to the next. And you will also find that flying outside of peak hours can also be financially beneficial. Flying late morning through afternoon is often a lot more expensive than catching a red eye or hopping on the first flight of the day.Think ""outside the box"" Consider nearby airports. For instance, while it may be more convenient to fly into San Francisco or JFK, flights to Oakland and Newark (respectively) are often a lot less expensive. Shop around Like many travelers, you may have your favorite airline or online travel agent (like Expedia, Orbitz or Travelocity) but it doesn't pay to restrict yourself to just one search. Plenty of times, better deals can be found by shopping around. And if you don't have the time to comparison shop, consider using a meta search engine that pulls airfare information (from hundreds of airline carriers and online travel agents) for you. Look at package deals It may seem obvious but, if you are not wedded to a specific hotel, consider package deals that bundle airfare with hotel and/or car rentals. Over the years we have seen some spectacular deals where, for as little as $2 more, you can also stay at a top-notch hotel. Know what you are paying for At the end of last month, a U.S. appeals court upheld a U.S. Transportation Department rule that states that any airfare shown in an advertisement must be ""the entire price to be paid by the customer."" This is great news because it means the fare that you see will now incorporate all taxes and government fees. However, there are other fees and charges that you should also know about -- for instance baggage fees.Stay connected The Internet is a wonderful thing. Thanks to social media there are now plenty of places where you can get alerts about incredible airfare deals. For instance Fly.com's own Twitter feed was named among the best by TIME magazine. If you are looking for even more of a helping hand, here are some cheap Labor Day flights found by our deal experts. - - Michelle Erickson is the director of public relations at Fly.com and is based in California.

Take Calculated Risks You can't get ahead in your finances without taking a few risks, but always research and assess those risks to make them as safe as possible. The few hours you'll spend checking out a purchase or investment will pay off far more than you would have earned spending those hours at work. Play the Long Game Buffet is said to never trade stocks, but only to invest. He rides out momentary dips in market prices and relies on the general upward trend of successful companies and economies. Your personal finances may suffer from occasional bumps and bruises, but that's never a reason to abandon your long-term goals.

There's tons of great information out there that you can research, but there's always the ""fine print"" details that most consumers overlook. How many of these were you aware of?1) We all know that getting a cash advance on a credit card is a dangerous route. Cash advances are treated differently than your standard purchases. These often come with unusually high interest rates, sometimes as high as 29.99%. However, did you know that your payments are applied to your standard purchases first? This means that the balance you're carrying on your cash advance will always accrue the 29.99% interest charge until you pay off your standard purchases first. So if you're still accumulating a balance on your credit card, you'll ultimately never be able to pay off your cash advance balance.2) Have you heard of the universal default clause on your cardholder agreement? The universal default allows credit card companies to increase your interest rates from your original agreement at any given time if you've defaulted on other accounts. It doesn't matter if you've been their best customer for years. Credit card companies run soft credit reports on you every month so they have an idea of how you're keeping up with other accounts. If they see that you defaulted on a mortgage, auto loan, or another credit card, they may assess you as a possible high risk consumer.3) Did you know that you can ask for a different due dates? If you're juggling multiple credit cards, it can be easy to lose track of all the different due dates. And of course, this is why we always recommend setting up payment reminders. All it takes is a simple phone call.4) Have you ever looked at the return address on your credit card statement? Chances are that it's based in South Dakota or Delaware. That's because these two states have weak ""usury laws"" which means that there is no cap on the interest rate they can charge. See below for a list of states where your creditors are mostly located.5) Are you paying your bills on time? You're considered a deadbeat. Yes, a deadbeat. The credit card industry refers to people who carry a balance as a ""revolver"" and people who pay off their balance in full as ""deadbeats."" This is because credit card companies tend to make very little money off financially responsible consumers.The important lesson to be learned is to always be a deadbeat! Avoid cash advances and always make sure you're paying every single one of your bills on time. Late payments can get you trapped into a never ending spiral of debt.Originally published on OnBetterTerms"

The Spanish government issued arrest warrants on August 8 for left-wing activists, including Gordillo, after a large group of left-wing activists occupied and looted supermarkets in Ecija and Arcos de la Frontera on August 7 to redistribute goods to a local non-profit providing food to the needy and those affected by the recession. Gordillo is currently participatin in a land occupation action and protest at the 'Turquillas' camp, farmland owned by the Ministry of Defence which the activists say is misused and should be redistributed to local families and farmers, east of Sevilla, between the towns of Osuna and Ecija.

In the 21st century, this is an absolute disgrace,"" he told Reuters this week in an interview in the Atocha train station in Madrid, tugging on his greying Fidel Castro-style beard.Sanchez Gordillo says he wants to draw attention to the human face of Spain's economic mess - poverty levels have risen b y over 15 percent since 2007, a quarter of workers are jobless and tens of thousands have been evicted from their homes.The conservative government says an official has no business flouting the law.""You can't be Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham,"" said Alfonso Alonso, spokesman for the ruling People's Party (PP) in the national Parliament. ""This man is just searching for publicity at the cost of everyone else.""Media coverage of the supermarket stunt has made Sanchez Gordillo a national celebrity. While talking to Reuters he was approached by supporters who shook his hand and thanked him for his stand against the conservative government.MARCHHis home province of Andalusia is one of the parts of Spain worst hit by its crisis: one worker in three is jobless.On Thursday he begins his trek from Jodar, the town with Andalusia's highest unemployment rate, planning to march across the region in blistering summer heat to persuade other local leaders to refuse to comply with government reforms.He plans to tell mayors to skip debt payments, stop layoffs, cease home evictions and ignore central government demands for budget cuts, a message that infuriates Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government as it tries to convince investors in Spanish bonds that he can fix the battered economy.The EU has demanded Spain shrink one of Europe's highest budget deficits to prevent the continent's debt crisis from spreading. Rajoy, in power since December, has ordered spending cuts and tax hikes. With poverty rising at one the fastest rates in Europe, protests have gained momentum.Despite the small size of the town where he has been mayor for 30 years, Sanchez Gordillo has long been a fringe figure on the national stage, known for criticism of the mainstream political parties.He has introduced a cooperative farming system in Marinaleda and has repeatedly tried to take over land for farming, the latest target being 1,200 hectares of land owned by the Ministry of Defence.His message used to draw only a small following during Spain's boom years when many farm workers, especially in agricultural Andalusia, abandoned fields to work in the profitable construction sector.But now he has won far more attention as the collapse of a housing bubble forced thousands of unskilled workers back onto farms, while the government sank billions of euros of taxpayer funds into weak banks.""They say I'm dangerous. And the bankers who are let off for fraud? That's not dangerous? The banks which borrow from the ECB for 1 percent then resell that debt to Spaniards for 6 percent - they're not dangerous?"" he said."

Bailed-out Portugal has managed to sell euro 2 billion ($2.5 billion) in short-term bonds at a lower cost than Spain, suggesting the much larger country's troubles are not spilling over to its neighbor. Spain and Italy are struggling to borrow money at affordable rates, and Greece, Ireland and Portugal have needed bailout loans from the other countries. (AP/Paulo Duarte)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c22801f00005100211acf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Our culture is fascinated with winning, from high-stakes activities like the Olympics or the NBA Finals to college football to even Little League games. It's how we've been raised and it's become a part of who we are. Even when it comes to money and investments, we are fascinated with winning. Whether it's picking the next hot stock or participating in exclusive ""referred in only"" investment opportunities a la Bernie Madoff, our goal is to win. So much emphasis has been placed on winning it's no wonder no one pays any attention to losing.Your buddy is quick to share with you any big wins with his investments but doesn't dare discuss those major losses he's racked up. As someone who has traded stocks, options and E-mini futures, I can certainly relate to the psychological battle. But what if it were possible to win without losing? What if your investment or trading activities could be structured in such a way that you win by simply not losing? You would consider something like this a riskless way to invest or trade. Can such a thing exist? Absolutely! You just need to move past your blind spots and think outside of the box to make it happen.A quick story will illustrate this concept. After years of losing money in the stock market, delaying retirement and seeing what was once a $2 million portfolio now only worth $1 million, John decides to pull all of his money out of the market and ""park"" it in a safe CD that pays 5 percent per year. After the first year of doing this, he takes the 5 percent yield from year one to gamble at a weekend Las Vegas trip. Figuring his retirement goals are all but dead, Vegas for the weekend was a welcomed treat for him.After a weekend of gambling in Vegas, it turns out he had a lucky hand and returns back home with twice what he took with him. Monday morning he heads off to the bank to add all of that money to his CD so now he has $1.1 million in his CD as opposed to just $1 million. At the end of year two, he takes the yield from year two and makes a similar trip to Vegas. Surprisingly, lady luck is on his side and again he comes back with twice what he took with him. He took the 5 percent yield on $1.1 million, or $55,000, and returned with $110,000 from Vegas. On Monday morning, he makes another deposit to his CD account taking the balance from $1.1 million to $1.21 millionAt the end of year three, you know the deal, he takes the 5 percent yield on $1.21 million, or $60,500, with him to Vegas for another weekend of gambling except this time around, lady luck is not on his side. He loses the entire $60,500. So upon returning home, he has nothing to add to his CD but as he reviews his statement, he realizes he still has $1.21 million safely tucked away in his account that will still earn a 5 percent yield for year four. The question to ask yourself is: If you were John, would you have taken your initial principal of $1 million with you to gamble in Vegas and left the $50,000 yield back at the CD?If you said no -- and by God I hope so -- then the question is if you are investing for your future or trading for a living, why would you put your entire nest egg or principal amount you've accumulated after all of these years of working at risk in the stock or financial markets? Isn't that the same thing as taking it all with you to Vegas? The key to this strategy is finding the right place to ""park your money."" Managing my wealth this way allowed me to achieve financial independence at the age of 34 as well as avoid the market crashes of 2008 and 2009.Apply these principles to help you win the money game!
