Growing up in working-class Boston in the late '70s/early '80s, I loved all the things that a good little gay boy would -- jelly bracelets, Lisa Frank stickers, Doug Barr from The Fall Guy -- but I never got to truly let my gay freak flag fly with Barbie. My father was an old-school Italian with a Magnum P.I. mustache and a night job loading trucks for UPS. His son wasn't going to be gay. And he sure as hell wasn't going to be playing with dolls.But this universal struggle not only opened gay boys' eyes but taught us how to improvise, operate on the down-low to sneak what we so desperately needed. So I had contraband Barbies, acquired Barbies from my older sisters that operated under cover. I either had to play with them when my dad wasn't around or play with them like men would: I could mutilate them, cut off all their hair or just straight-up decapitate them. (Hi, commentary on society.)Of course, all I really wanted to do was dress them, braid their hair, give their lives purpose. The life's purpose of my contraband Barbies was to borrow a cup of sugar. That's all they did: walk to whichever couch leg I deemed ""next door"" and borrow a cup of sugar. My storytelling was a bit limited at the time. When I got older, I finessed my plotting as a TV writer, forging a career specializing in complicated women who could be anything: an astronaut, the president... or a cheerleader.I don't call my dancers ""cheerleaders"" on my new scripted VH1 drama Hit the Floor. They are dancers, thank you. Specifically, they're Los Angeles Devil Girls, the premiere dance team in all of professional basketball. They've got fierce outfits, more sequins than you could choke a gay horse with and gloriously long, flowing, braidable hair. That's right: I finally got my own Barbies. And these are fabulous:""Girl-Next-Door Barbie"" Ahsha Hayes is played by newcomer Taylour Paige. Ahsha tries out for the Devil Girls behind the back of a mother who was burned by her own experience dancing for the team back in the day. She comes complete with heaps of optimism and a magnet for attracting drama.""Haunted Barbie"" Sloane Hayes is played by Kimberly Elise. Sloane fled the wild world of pro basketball and is being dragged back into it by her daughter. Her accessories include a comb for her gorgeous natural hair and ghosts from the past.""Bitch Barbie"" Jelena Howard is played by Logan Browning. Jelena is the superstar team captain who sees the threat in Ahsha and promptly sets out to wreck her. She comes with a super-cool red satin jacket with a ""J"" on it and a thirst for blood.""Stripper Barbie"" Kyle Hart is played by Katherine Bailess. Kyle shook her moneymaker for car salesmen in Carson, Calif., but tries out for the Devils to dance for their A-list front row with way deeper pockets. Be careful when pulling her string; she's likely to say anything. (For ages 21 and up.)""Telenovela Barbie"" Raquel Saldaña is played by Valery Ortiz. A Devil Girl vet, Raquel leads with her heart instead of her head, so she can sometimes be her own worst enemy. She comes with a 4-year-old son, with one of the douchiest guys on the planet as his baby daddy. ""Businesswoman Barbie"" Olivia Vincent is played by Charlotte Ross. Olivia is the director of the Devil Girls, a former Devil Girl herself who's part den mother, part exacting taskmaster. Her many designer outfits go for two grand a piece. Collect them all!Of course, we also have Kens: prickly all-star-turned-coach Pete Davenport, played by Dean Cain; Ahsha's soulful gym-teacher boyfriend German Vega, played by Jonathan McDaniel; the Devils' star baller and king to Jelena's queen Terrence Wall, played by Robert Christopher Riley; and bad-boy shooting guard and rival for Ahsha's affection Derek Roman. Like Ken, their abs are rock-hard. Unlike Ken, they aren't just another one of Barbie's accessories. These Kens have junk down below.Every week I dress my Barbies in different outfits, do their hair, put on their makeup and have them perform a big dance number. None of them have had an opportunity to go next door and borrow a cup of sugar, but I'm working on it.People grow up, including gay boys and their fathers who didn't know any better. I get to play with Barbies every week, and my dad couldn't be prouder.Hit the Floor premieres on Memorial Day, Monday, May 27, at 9 p.m. EDT on VH1."

It's the flag that was draped over my wife's coffin at her funeral on Feb. 10. It is military custom to personally and proudly present that flag to the spouse of a fallen soldier, but because my wife, CW2 Charlie Morgan of the New Hampshire National Guard, was married to a woman instead of to a man, our marriage doesn't exist in the eyes of the government that she served for 17 years. Charlie was an amazing wife, mother and soldier who died in February after a five-year battle with metastatic breast cancer. But in our 16 years together, cancer wasn't the only battle that we fought. Even as Charlie served her country, we lived as a family in hiding, with the discriminatory ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy hanging over our every move. It was only when DADT was lifted in 2010 that we could safely be a family in the eyes of the military and make the public promise of marriage to each other.But our short-lived celebration quickly came to a halt when we realized that the federal Defense of Marriage Act still prohibited the military from acknowledging both our 10-year civil union and our legal New Hampshire marriage. It dawned on us that if Charlie were to lose her battle with cancer, I would not be viewed as her wife. I would not be assured the financial protections that military spouses depend on in the wake of losing a life partner. I was terrified. I couldn't stop worrying about what this meant for our 5-year-old daughter, Casey Elena. Charlie was a soldier in every sense of the word, and she fought her final battle ferociously so that others wouldn't have to go through that same pain. In the end, cancer claimed Charlie before the battle was won.Now I keep fighting in her memory. In March, just weeks after losing my wife, I watched with tears in my eyes as the cases against both DOMA and California's Proposition 8 made their way to the Supreme Court of the United States. I had that strength only because of Charlie. She dedicated her life to her country and her family, and before she died, she made me promise never to give up.Since Charlie's death, I have applied and been rejected for survivorship benefits, such as VA and Social Security benefits that would have automatically been available to a heterosexual spouse. I do not have access to the health insurance that heterosexual spouses have when their loved one dies on active duty. When I die, I will not be allowed to be buried beside my wife in the veterans' cemetery.Facing this future as a second-class citizen, I desperately hope that the Supreme Court will bring equality to all gay families and strike down DOMA. It haunts almost every aspect of our lives, and it doesn't measure up to the litmus test of freedom and equality that we've set as a standard for our way of life in the United States. It's time for freedom and justice to prevail, and for those who purport to stand for those values to apply them fairly to all the citizens of our country."

NY1 reports that 19-year-old Manuel Riquelme allegedly assaulted Queer Rising co-founder Eugene Lovendusky, 28. Officials say the alleged attack took place in the wee hours of May 25 on West 42nd Street, not far from Times Square in Manhattan. Riquelme has been charged with hate crime and aggravated harassment after allegedly hitting Lovendusky in the face. Sources told NY1 that Lovendusky was leaving the XL nightclub with his boyfriend and another friend when a group of nine teenagers, including Riquelme, passed the three men and started calling them anti-gay slurs.Lovendusky was not seriously hurt, according to reports. Fellow activist Scott Wooledge was among those to sound off on the attack. Wooledge, who's also a HuffPost Gay Voices blogger, wrote that the attack ""hits home as I know this man personally"" on Facebook. He then added: ""I can’t do much to help make the world safer for my friends. But I have a platform, and I’m sending out this message to gay bashers: 'You can kick us. You can punch us. You can shoot us dead as you did Mark Carson and Harvey Milk. But the LGBT community will not go back to the days before Stonewall Riots and DADT repeal. We will not abandon our righteous claim to be treated equally under the US Constitution and the laws of our states. You will lose eventually. And eventually we LGBT people will meet our respective Gods with our hands clean of blood.'""As The Advocate points out, Lovendusky helped organize a May 20 vigil honoring Carson, who was shot and killed in an alleged anti-gay hate crime in New York's West Village. In addition to Carson, Lovendusky's case marks the ninth alleged anti-LGBT attack in New York in the past month, The New Civil Rights Movement points out. On May 5, a gay Brooklyn couple was allegedly knocked to the ground by four men emerging from a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden. The alleged culprits shouted anti-gay slurs at the pair in broad daylight, according to the report.Meanwhile, two 21-year-old suspects, Asllan Berisha and Brian Ramirez, were arrested and charged with gang assault and assault as a hate crime in connection with yet another alleged anti-gay attack in the area, according to the New York Post.Another victim, who was not identified, was coming out of the West Village gay bar Pieces when he was attacked by two men who were yelling gay slurs earlier this month.

But most important to remember in times when we're forced out of our comfort zones is that we come equipped with an unbelievable capacity to adapt to change and a God-given gift of resilience. And although we're creatures bound by habit, our true strengths and authentic selves awaken only in the face of unfamiliar circumstances.Each day, I experience the challenges of my clients and their difficulties transitioning to new stages of life: a complicated divorce, the sudden death of a loved one, losing a lucrative job, or being forced to move. Rightfully so, unforeseen changes cause distress, uncertainty, and a pressing sense of fear. So what are we to do when our habits are interrupted and our stability is tested? Keep these few truths in minds when the comfort rug is swept from under your feet:Be prepared: Don't let an unanticipated event devastate your life. It's all too easy to become your own worst enemy when you've been pushed out of your comfort zone; you can fall victim to false comforts such as addictive substances or negative behaviors. But if you plan ahead and prepare yourself for the changes that are bound to happen, you can anticipate their occurrence and take the necessary steps to secure your well-being.Understand the greater reason: There is a greater reason behind every unwelcomed event. What may seem like a tragedy at first can end up being a blessing in disguise. Though you may not understand it (and you don't have to until the time is right), trust that what is happening to you is happening for a higher purpose and for your own ultimate good. Each one of your hardships is a catalyst for necessary change.Seize the opportunities: Every new chapter comes with challenges, yes, but it's also accompanied by brand new opportunities. For example, your relationship may have ended, but maybe you weren't treated the way you deserved and now you have to opportunity to finally meet the right person for you. Embrace your challenges and break from what you're used to; allowing opportunities to come to you means detaching from old patterns that can keep you stuck in vicious cycles. Think accordingly: Alter your mentality to adapt to your changes. Just as a chameleon adjusts its colors based on its surroundings, so too must you camouflage with your environment. You are multifaceted and possess all the skills required to succeed; utilize your wide range of talents to thrive in any given situation. It all begins with having the right mentality and the right attitude. Distract with productivity: The single best way to overcome any life challenge is to be productive. Take up new hobbies that can also help your physical, mental, or spiritual health such as exercise, brain games, inspirational stories, or group classes. Being productive engages you wholly by rerouting your attention towards positive activities. Reenergize yourself with something fresh and different.Recognize your true strength: You are stronger than you imagine. And only when you're out of your comfort zone does your deepest strength emerge to help you survive a trying time. It's like a part of you that has been dormant awakens. In time, your strength grows, just as your muscles grow with exercise. Remind yourself of all the times you've been faced with a similar situation and have successfully surpassed it. Let time be your healer: Whenever you find yourself feeling down, remember that it gets better each second of each day; time is your inevitable healing force. Allow this thought to soothe your heart and still your mind. When feelings of anxiety or worry creep in, refer to the age-old phrase: ""In time, this too shall pass.""Look toward the future: Anticipate a near future in which you feel secure, stable, and in your rightful place. Practice visualizations of the resolution of outstanding issues: How will your problems be solved? Who will help you? How will you feel, look, react when that day comes? Using your mind's eye, paint the picture of a time soon to come when the details that seem disoriented now have fallen into perfect order once more.Pray and believe: No matter your creed, having faith in a higher force indirectly endows you with faith in yourself. Understand that your comfort zone is actually a place within you and not a set of circumstances outside of you. Prayer will switch your mindset to acceptance, tranquility, and harmony. When you pray, you hand your problems to the divine and become unburdened so that you can focus on what's most important to you.While we may want to settle in our comfort zones forever, sudden shifts are simply unavoidable. But if we accept our challenges as critical to personal evolution and progress, we can surpass the inconvenience of unwanted circumstances. The unpredictability of life then becomes the miracle of life, and perhaps we begin to look forward to our next challenge.

Despite her victory, McQueen spent her senior year sequestered from her peers and was never awarded a true diploma.An early 1959 Virginia Supreme Court ruling overturning Massive Resistance would have allowed McQueen to attend the previously all-white Lane High School.The School Board, however, had other ideas. McQueen was barred from Lane, and spent her senior year being tutored in the School Board office.Albemarle County Public Schools Superintendent Pamela Moran, and Charlottesville City Schools Superintendent Rosa Atkins awarded McQueen her diploma in a ceremony at what is now Burley Middle School. When McQueen was a student, Burley served as the black high school for both county and city students. It is now an Albemarle County school.""What a day this is,"" McQueen, who grew up on Ridge Street, said. ""It really was a surprise when I received a call saying that something was being planned, but I didn't know to what extent something was being planned.""In the auditorium where she watched her peers graduate in June 1959, the school system and the Burley High Varsity Club celebrated McQueen's contribution to generations of African-American school children who came after her.""I would like to think that I have made a difference, and continue to make a difference,"" she said after being handed a framed diploma by Atkins and Moran. ""But the truth is, we have all made a difference.""McQueen's lack of a high school diploma did not slow her down. After high school, she attended Hampton University, where she received a bachelor of science degree in early childhood education in 1963. She then earned a master's of education from Trinity College in Washington, D.C.From there, McQueen spent her career as an educator outside of Virginia, county school officials said. She now lives in Washington, D.C.Waltine Eubanks, a 1959 graduate of Burley High School, presented McQueen with two flowers tied with ribbons in Burley's green and gold school colors and Lane High's orange and black.""I just have to say 'Hallelujah' and 'Thank you, Jesus,'"" Eubanks said as she presented McQueen with the flowers. ""Olivia, you were born for a time such as this.""For Atkins, the event held special meaning.""I stand here so proud of you, so proud of your strength, so proud of your determination,"" she said. "" ... Because 10 years later, this superintendent was allowed to go to school with other white boys and girls.""Charles Yancey, president of the Burley High class of 1959, compared McQueen's struggle to that of Ernie Davis, a football running back and the first black Heisman Trophy winner. Davis was drafted first overall into the NFL, but died of leukemia before ever playing a game.""Just as Ernie Davis faced insurmountable obstacles, so did Olivia McQueen,"" Yancey said.

If technology becomes invisible to us, we risk losing sight of how it shapes us, for good and for ill.",2013-05-26,"A visitor of the 'NEXT Berlin' conference tries out the Google Glass on April 24, 2013 in Berlin. 'NEXT Berlin' describes itself as 'a meeting place for the European digital industry'. Organisers say that at the conference, 'marketing decision-makers and business developers meet technical experts and creative minds to discuss what will be important in the next 12 months'. The conference is running from April 23 to 24, 2013. AFP PHOTO / OLE SPATA / GERMANY OUT (Photo credit should read Ole Spata/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb365d63c000018010c613b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Heading home last week after a walk in Central Park, I saw a bearded man on his hands and knees, peering at a patch of plants poking up between the sidewalk's cobblestones. Lost key or contact lens? I stopped to ask. No, he was just looking, he told me, running his fingers across a tuft of grass and over a mossy cushion of green. Two plants that normally flower in April and August were blooming simultaneously in May, he said. Are you a botanist? I asked. He stood up beside his bicycle. No, he said, just interested.You never know what you might see if you look down, or around, or in a new direction. Take a minute and you might notice something unexpected -- evidence of a tiny glitch in a seasonal rhythm, or a bonsai-size bit of wilderness breaking though a stony byway.Yes, we often hear this exhortation to 'wake up.' Immersed in virtual worlds, we particularly miss much of the earthly wonder budding around us. In her intriguing new book On Looking, the animal cognition expert Alexandra Horowitz takes 11 city walks with experts such as a geologist or an artist in order to make the ""familiar become unfamiliar."" Her book is timely. With our finite attentional capacities, we do miss so much in life.But as Horowitz would attest, the topic of awareness can be a Pandora's Box. Why should alert awareness matter when we have so much 'coming at us' all day long? Isn't the real problem honing our focus, rather than trying to drink more from the experiential firehose? The question of exercising our awareness is complex, and yet matters more than ever today. Here's why:First, we are creatures of habit, prone to see, hear and think the familiar and expected -- whether online or on the sidewalks we cross each day. This is in part why babies amuse us. They exude delighted interest in everything, since nearly everything is new to them. We can't exist child-like, open to everything. But turning off our ingrained 'eyes of habit' once in a while makes us more inventive. People who live abroad or are bilingual are more likely to be creative, simply because inhabiting a new country or language inspires what psychologists call 'cognitive flexibility.' Knowing two ways to drink tea or multiple words for love expands our horizons of understanding. We need to look up from our humdrum commute -- or from our same old stomping grounds on the Web.Even more importantly, truly seeing anew isn't simply a matter of glancing around. It involves noticing, and then comprehending what's familiar and what's new on multiple levels. Two blooming weeds in the pavement may cause a moment's admiration for their unexpected beauty. But understanding whether or not their cycles of flowering are askew and so further evidence of climate change demands effort, not simple snapshot observation. Exercising our awareness involves probing and testing our assumptions.Today, the popular idea that our devices should fade into the background -- exemplified by Google's aim to get technology 'out of the way' via its Google Glass -- is alarming. As I told the Huffington Post's Bianca Bosker in a recent interview, if technology becomes invisible to us, we risk losing sight of how it shapes us, for good and for ill. We will stop noticing the 'Google effect' -- the complacency we show while searching online -- and we will sadly keep assuming that Facebook-style template identities can express our whole enigmatic selves.We can't see our devices and their torrents of information anew each moment. Our tools invariably will fade into the background of our lives. (While reading a book, I see its content, not the print technology I hold in hand.) But we must sometimes step back and try to comprehend how new, powerful digital technologies influence us, as well as what they deliver to our minds. Waking up to the world is a two-fold responsibility: seeing, then understanding. If we don't manage to do this with our digital and earthly habitats, we will be abdicating a role in the making of our future."

And, at the very least, the inevitable death of independent cinema, which admittedly ranks lower at the box office than it did in the years between 1950 and 1980. There are several reasons for this: the proliferation of entertainment options, the displacement of creative inspiration to unfamiliar countries, cost inflation, scarcity of funding, industry pressure, etc.Undaunted by the deluge of these various threats, the Cannes Film Festival isn't lowering its guard. It is pursuing its mission to protect independent cinema. It celebrates, cultivates, encourages, support and cherishes it. For the one as for the other, this is a matter of survival.I remember all the unknown directors the festival has discovered in the last 30 years. I remember a proud young boy named Nanni Moretti, presenting his first film Ecco Bombo in Super 8 in competition in the Grand Auditorium. I remember a young Danish punk prone to panic attacks who couldn't even go down the Hotel Carlton stairs... He became Lars von Trier. I remember Krzysztof Kieslowski, Steven Soderbergh, who won the Palme d'Or and his star the Best Actor award the year Bertolucci chaired the jury. I remember Jane Campion, who came to show three short films and left with the Palme for shorts, and then a few years later with the Palme d'Or for The Piano. I remember Quentin Tarantino and how his film Reservoir Dogs cultivated black humor to the point of having a mobster cut off another mobster's ear, then pick it up and, literally, speak into his ear! I remember.For all these years the Cannes Film Festival has had this function of springboard, look-out, launching rocket, and it will continue to perform it in the future.This perpetual discovery, moreover, is the most exciting aspect for someone on the selection committee.Yet this does not mean it should ignore popular cinema, the quality commercial cinema of the kind American studios, for example, have been making for years.Indeed, the two souls of cinema coexist in Cannes: independent cinema and commercial cinema. And this magical equilibrium must be preserved, one embellishing the other, making it sing the way a fine wine inspires a delicious dish.Who, then, will win the Palme d'Or this year? Remember the Palme goes, by definition, to a film that, in addition to its great intrinsic qualities, has the potential to be a hit with the public, while the Grand Prix is supposed to foster exploration, originality, the new writing of tomorrow's films.So, who, dear Steven Spielberg? Who, ladies and gentlemen of the jury?We can't wait! At this point, we'll know soon.What's wonderful in Cannes, in either case, is when a film grabs the audience, takes them to paradise, moves them, touches their hearts, transports them to an altered state. There, moved, overwhelmed even, all they can do is applaud wildly, tirelessly, for minutes on end, left bound and helpless in the hands of the god-like creator.Until the small ordinary facts of life, life as it is, everyday life, take over again, while waiting for the next time, waiting for the next conflagration of the soul."

(Photo by Aby Baker/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb42b0b250000360038e20b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Reviewing my Huffington Post archive recently, I was reminded that my very first piece, published on the sixth anniversary of 9/11, concerned New York City movies that brought back the city of my youth, which (to age myself) was during the seventies and eighties.A decidedly grittier town back then, it was no less exciting.As a native New Yorker who has never really left, and never wanted to, it felt totally appropriate for New York movies to be the topic of my first entry. And now, nearly six years later, it feels ripe for revisiting.It's a point of pride that no other city has so many good movies set in it as New York. Even a cursory Google search yields literally hundreds of titles shot here. I challenged myself to winnow down this massive list to a manageable number of classics that I would pick to own and watch till the end of my days.Not content with the typical top ten list, I went for 11 quintessentially New York movies I simply couldn't live without. (Just click on any title for the full review on our site.)For those cynics who may cite the obvious character of these picks, let me reference a quote from director Robert Altman: ""It's better to see a great movie again than an average one the first time. Because even though the movie hasn't changed, you have. And you'll see something new.""Words to live by. I doubt your re-screening any of these titles after a period of years would result in disappointment. Try it and see.Of course, there are so many more New York City winners, many of them under-exposed- so please submit your own picks.The Pride Of The Yankees (1942) -- Talk about the power of nostalgia. Sam Wood's reverential biopic on Lou Gehrig is not just a tribute to our city, our national pastime, and one of our homegrown heroes, it also celebrates New York's proud immigrant, melting-pot traditions, felt strongly to this day.Rear Window (1954) -- Why was Hitchcock a genius? One reason: he built an immense yet intricate set on a soundstage, and then made a stunningly effective and evocative New York City film- in L.A.!Sweet Smell Of Success (1957) -- ""I love this dirty town!"", says Burt Lancaster -- and so do we, in one of his signature films -- a sour, caustic tale about a twisted gossip columnist, partly modeled on the legendary Walter Winchell. Lancaster is superb, and guess what, so is Tony Curtis.The Apartment (1960) -- Billy Wilder's bittersweet summit, with Jack Lemmon a lonely insurance man in Manhattan who falls for elevator girl Shirley MacLaine. Often categorized as a comedy, it's really a romantic drama with funny bits sprinkled throughout. Midnight Cowboy (1969) -- Two drifters meet in a mutual attempt to survive in, then escape from, Manhattan's grimy underbelly. Hoffman is incredible as Ratso. The kind they don't make anymore, this ""Cowboy"" still packs a hefty wallop.The French Connection (1971) -- Maybe the best cop movie ever, portraying one of the city's bigger drug busts back in the day. Gene Hackman won as Oscar and became a bankable star with this movie -- and it's easy to see why.Mean Streets (1973) -- Scorsese's breakthrough about a conflicted small-time crook and his wacko, self-destructive cousin in Little Italy. Rich in emotion, immediacy, and atmosphere, this film set the pungent, propulsive Scorsese style we'd see again in movies like 1990's Goodfellas.The Godfather, Part 2 (1974) -- Coppola managed to improve on a masterpiece with this one, which paints on a broader canvas and offers even richer period flavor. And for the price of Brando, we get a young Robert De Niro, who's equally brilliant.Annie Hall (1977) -- Inveterate New Yorker Woody Allen's best film ever, with some hilariously dead-on insights about the bi-coastal dilemma: New York vs. Los Angeles. I'm with Woody: give me Gotham every time. This turned Diane Keaton into a star, and it's still her signature role. Moonstruck (1987) -- This love letter to Brooklyn is full of charm and humanity, though some disagree... worth the price of admission for Vincent Gardenia and Olympia Dukakis alone. And look for an unusual early turn from Nic Cage as a mooning, eccentric baker.As Good As It Gets (1997) -- Writer with serious Asperger's and OCD falls for a waitress at his neighborhood diner, where the management barely tolerates him. Only in New York, right? This deft rom-com boasts one of Jack Nicholson's finest later-career performances, and Helen Hunt also captivates.Looking for good movies to watch? Top movie recommendations?

(Photo by Harry How/Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6e4bd2200004301dceeba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Commissioner Bud Selig's contract is set to expire in 17 months. When it does Selig expects to gracefully walk into the sunset at age 80 leaving the game in the hands of an eventual successor.Bob Costas' name came to mind as, not only as candidate heir to Selig's throne, but a legitimate one. Costas is arguably the top sports journalist in the country. He also happens to adore baseball.Does Costas' impeccable journalistic career, his love of baseball and overall intellect make him a viable candidate to lead Major League Baseball?Instead of wondering I decided to reach out to Costas and gauge his potential interest in being commissioner. I also wanted to know Costas' thoughts about possible changes he would make in baseball and what he'd recommend to increase the percentage of African-Americans playing in the Major Leagues.When asked if he would consider replacing Bud Selig as commissioner Costas responded:""I have no interest at in succeeding Selig. I have always flatly stated I considered myself unqualified for the position.""I then proposed the following hypothetical question: If you were commissioner what is the one thing you would change about the game to make it better?Costas replied, ""I would expand the use of instant replay in the post-season, and change the rule regarding 40 man rosters in September. Having so many players available distorts strategy, and it makes no sense to play important pennant race games under drastically different conditions than the rest of the season.""The number of African-American players is steadily declining. In 1975 the player representation rate was at an all-time high of 25 percent but today it's at an all-time low. According to Dr. Richard Lapchick, the director of The Institute of Diversity and Ethics in Sports, African-American participation rate is at 7.7 percent.I asked Costas what variables he feels have contributed to the methodical decline in African-American participation and what needs to happen to entice more African-Americans to play the game? Costas stated, ""Baseball has actually tried very hard to increase African American participation, with marketing efforts, and with inner-city academies and programs like RBI reviving baseball in the inner cities. But they are up against some cultural trends.""He continued, ""Young black athletes seem to prefer basketball and football, which obviously have much higher levels of African-American participation. Also, very few college baseball programs offer as many scholarships or the full scholarship benefits that basketball and football do. And college baseball, in most places, is not a glamour sport drawing large crowds like the football and basketball programs do.""Costas then touched on the economics of the game and how that potentially factors into the African-American decline: ""In addition, elite baseball programs at the youth level have become more and more expensive with travel teams and the like. Many, though certainly not all African-American kids, can't afford to be part of those programs where as their high schools provide basketball and football opportunities.""Costas talked about the family unit and how it plays a pivotal in the lack of a strong African-American presence at the Major League level. Costas suggested, ""Last, and this is a sensitive area, but one that does realistically play into the issue. Baseball tends to be a father son game-at least when a kid is first introduced to it. As we know, in certain portions of the black community, fatherlessness is a problem that goes well beyond baseball, but probably is a factor when it comes to declining baseball participation among black youth.""Some experts, me included, believe racism plays at least a role in the lack of African-Americans currently in baseball. To the contrary, Costas suggests the lack of an African-American presence is not so much a result of race-rather it's a complicated cultural dichotomy that exists within the African-American community.Costas stated, ""This is not a question of bigotry. Witness the huge influx of Hispanic players, many of them players of color, along with increasing numbers of players from Asia. This is a cultural rather than racial question. It's complicated, but I believe baseball is sincere in the pride it feels about the rich history of African-Americans in the Major Leagues, and its desire to see more African-Americans -- both on the field and in the stands.""Sadly facts indicate African-Americans are methodically becoming strangers to a game that was once a rich part of the fabric in their communities.It's safe to say there's no clear-cut reason for the methodical decline of African-Americans participation: Only the passage of time and a well orchestrated plan will change the current issues that hamper baseball in hopes of a brighter future for African-Americans in the game.Email Dexter directly at drttcd@gmail.com and/or follow him on Twitter: @DextersVPoint."

(AP) — Quarterback Everett Golson is no longer enrolled at Notre Dame.University spokesman Dennis Brown said Saturday night that Golson, who had three years of eligibility left after not playing as a freshman, was no longer enrolled at Notre Dame as of Friday. Brown says he couldn't comment on why because of federal privacy laws.Golson helped lead the Fighting Irish to an undefeated regular season and the BCS title game last season as a first-time starter.The departure leaves a major question mark at a position where coach Brian Kelly was expecting to see major improvement in an offense that struggled for much of last season, with the Irish finishing 54th in the nation in total offense, including 71st in passing offense. The most likely replacement is Tommy Rees, the 2011 starter who came in to play key roles in victories over Purdue, Michigan, Stanford and Brigham Young when Golson either struggled or was injured.But Rees lacks the mobility that Kelly likes and struggled with turnovers as a starter two seasons ago. The other possibilities are senior Andrew Hendrix, who has seen limited action but is more mobile than Rees and has two seasons of eligibility left, and freshman Malik Zaire. Gunner Kiel didn't take part in spring practices with the Irish and has enrolled at Cincinnati.Golson was 187 of 318 passing, a 58.8 completion rate, with 12 touchdown passes and six interceptions as the Irish went 12-1 last season, losing 42-14 loss to Alabama in the championship game. He had a pass efficiency rating of 131.01, placing him 62nd among quarterbacks nationwide. But after a year of quarterback controversy a year earlier, Golson was locked in as the starter for the upcoming season until the news broke Saturday.It's the latest in a string of bad news for the Irish this year, starting with the blowout loss to Alabama, leaving many to question whether the Irish were as close to challenging for a national title as they appeared to be when they finished the regular season 12-0 and were ranked No. 1 for the first time in nearly two decades. Then soon after the embarrassing loss, news broke about linebacker Manti Te'o, the Heisman Trophy runner-up, was duped into an Internet romance with a girlfriend he never met who turned out to be a man pretending to be the woman."
