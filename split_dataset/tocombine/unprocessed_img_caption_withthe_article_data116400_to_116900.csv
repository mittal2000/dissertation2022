A large swath of Lac Megantic was destroyed Saturday after a train carrying crude oil derailed, sparking several explosions and forcing the evacuation of up to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul Chiasson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb159d7240000510096bf84.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Mathieu BelangerLAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec, July 6 (Reuters) - Thousands of people gathered in the small town of Lac-Megantic, Quebec on Sunday to remember the victims of a fiery crude oil train crash that killed 47 people and destroyed dozens of buildings in the picturesque lakeside village.In the early morning hours, survivors and family marched in silence along a newly-built boardwalk, past construction rubble and across the train tracks, where exactly one year earlier the runaway train derailed and exploded into a wall of fire.Hours later, politicians and dignitaries, including Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard, joined local residents in the St. Agnes church for the official memorial ceremony. Hundreds more, including an honor guard of emergency responders, lined the square outside to watch the service on screens.""On the first anniversary of this tragedy, we express again the suffering that we live with and the pain that is still very present,"" said Luc Cyr, Archbishop of Sherbrooke, leading the service in the French-speaking town. ""But in the middle of that personal and communal destruction, there is a rebirth underway, for this town and for its people.""It was in the early hours of July 6, 2013 that the brakes failed on a 72-car train parked uphill from Lac-Megantic, a quaint town nestled in Quebec's hilly Eastern Township region. Unattended, the train rolled downhill 11 km (7 miles), hit a curve and derailed near the waterfront.The subsequent explosions leveled more than 30 buildings, including the popular Musi-Cafe bar, which was packed with late-night revelers and a live band. The fiery blast also destroyed homes, killing families in their beds.One year later, a swath of Lac-Megantic's downtown core is still in rubble, with the slow pace of recovery frustrating residents, entrepreneurs and public officials.At the epicenter of the crash site, where thousands of liters of oil leaked from crushed tanker cars into the soil, the ground remains too polluted for reconstruction. Displaced businesses are slowly being rebuilt a short distance away.The community, shattered by the tragedy, is also slowly rebuilding. On Saturday, locals released young fish into the lake, planted flowers along the train tracks and set free hundreds of butterflies, according to media reports.And a new monument bearing the names of all 47 victims was unveiled on Sunday, with Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche urging her community to find peace in each other and the natural beauty of their town, founded in 1884 on the shores of its namesake lake.""To each and every one of you, I wish that you may continue to hope, and that you may continue to believe that we can rebuild our town and make it better than ever before,"" she said.In the aftermath of the train crash, regulators in both Canada and the United States moved to shore up safety with a slew of new rules. Canada's Transportation Safety Board said on Friday that its final report would be released in the next few months.The investigation has already led to criminal charges against the conductor and two other employees of the now-defunct Montreal, Maine & Atlantic (MMA) railway, and has also prompted Canada to adopt numerous safety measures, including the phasing out of older DOT-111 tanker cars by 2016.After the incident, MMA went bankrupt and the line was purchased by a New York investment firm. Repairs on the tracks were completed last autumn and trains now pass through Lac-Megantic several times a week. (Writing and additional reporting by Julie Gordon; Editing by Marguerita Choy)"

From the time it began operations in 1898, the 800 cells of the prison had almost continually been over crowded. Throughout it's history numerous calamities have occurred at the penitentiary including riots, mass escapes, and fires. Conditions at the facility were forbidding and harsh due to overcrowding, sanitation problems and insufficient ventilation. In 1983 a federal court decision prohibited the Tennessee Department of Corrections from ever housing prisoners at the TN State Prison. Since 1992 the facility has been left mostly abandoned. Several buildings on the massive compound are still in some use today, but the rest of the prison lies in disrepair and deterioration. The Tennessee State Prison is now a wonderland of decay. Not without danger, the buildings on the site are contaminated with black mold, asbestos, and lead based paint among other obvious perils. Yet, it is a completely fascinating location to explore. Numerous films and music videos have been shot on the grounds of the prison. Nearly all of my exploration of this site on this visit was of the medical facility on the northern end of the compound. The medical facility one of the most restricted buildings at the prison, attributable in part to damage caused by a film crew from VH1 that were visiting to shoot the ￃﾢￂﾀￂﾜCelebrity Paranormal Project.ￃﾢￂﾀￂﾝ References <a href=""http://www.historicdecay.com/component/option,com_rsgallery2/Itemid,26/catid,23/"" role=""link"" class="" js-entry-link cet-external-link"" data-vars-item-name=""Historic Decay"" data-vars-item-type=""text"" data-vars-unit-name=""5ba2b554e4b0c2784da4d059"" data-vars-unit-type=""buzz_body"" data-vars-target-content-id=""http://www.historicdecay.com/component/option,com_rsgallery2/Itemid,26/catid,23/"" data-vars-target-content-type=""url"" data-vars-type=""web_external_link"" data-vars-subunit-name=""article_body"" data-vars-subunit-type=""component"" data-vars-position-in-subunit=""0"">Historic Decay</a><a href=""http://www.abandonedonline.net/index.php?catid=301"" role=""link"" class="" js-entry-link cet-external-link"" data-vars-item-name=""Abandoned Online"" data-vars-item-type=""text"" data-vars-unit-name=""5ba2b554e4b0c2784da4d059"" data-vars-unit-type=""buzz_body"" data-vars-target-content-id=""http://www.abandonedonline.net/index.php?catid=301"" data-vars-target-content-type=""url"" data-vars-type=""web_external_link"" data-vars-subunit-name=""article_body"" data-vars-subunit-type=""component"" data-vars-position-in-subunit=""1"">Abandoned Online</a>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2b5542000004e00fec364.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MEXICO CITY, July 5 (Reuters) - Mexican police have detained a man who allegedly murdered four children and a woman in a small town in the center of the country, authorites said on Saturday, as statistics show a marked increased in the number of women being murdered.The state attorney's office in the town of San Luis Potosi said Filiberto Hernandez, 43, was detained on Thursday and confessed to five murders between 2010 and 2013. The office said he also raped his victims.The crimes took place in Tamuin, a town of 16,000 southeast of San Luis Potosi, where Hernandez was a karate teacher.The state attorney said it used the confession to find the remains of two of his victims, 9-year old Dulce Jimena Reyes, who disappeared in April, and Eliehoenai Chavez, 32, abducted in May after leaving the factory where she worked.He is also alleged to have killed Adriana Martinez, found dead in 2011 at the age of 13 after disappearing on the way home from school.State authorities are searching for the body of Rosa Maria Sanchez, missing since 2010 when she was 16, and that of 12-year old Itzel Castillo who disappeared in 2013, in fields close to where the others were found.Since former President Felipe Calderon launched a military offensive on Mexico's drug cartels at the end of 2006, more than 85,000 people have died. Between 2007 and 2012, the total number of murders more than doubled, rising 112 percent.Most victims were young men but the number of women killed shot up by more than one and a half times, 155 percent, to 2,764 in 2012, according to official data.

2,MEDIA,On Being a Foreign Correspondent,"Magda Abu-Fadil, ContributorDirector of Media Unlimited in Lebanon",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/on-being-a-foreign-corres_b_5560984.html,,2014-07-06,2014-07-06-LastissueoftheInternationalHeraldTribuneAbuFadil.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-06-LastissueoftheInternationalHeraldTribuneAbuFadil-thumb.jpg,"Rachele Kanigel's ""10 Tips for Training the Next Generation of Foreign Correspondents"" immediately drew my attention but her headline didn't quite match my expectations. She focused more on her experience in running a study abroad program than on preparing her charges for the rigors of overseas assignments. Kanigel, an associate professor of journalism at San Francisco State University, a former daily newspaper reporter, and an ex-freelancer for magazines and websites, hit on interesting points like making contact with local news organizations in the countries she and her students visited and finding in-country partners -- universities, language schools, or media.But her tips fell short of providing advice on how to equip aspiring correspondents with the necessary skills to function in foreign environments.It's true the heyday of the Paris-based International Herald Tribune (once co-owned by the mighty New York Times and Washington Post and replaced by the International New York Times), and flashy overseas network TV news bureaus are gone. Last issue of the International Herald Tribune (Abu-Fadil)Not everyone is cut out to be a foreign correspondent. Whether it's Belgian cartoon character Tintin or more thought-provoking live examples, foreign correspondents are different animals. Screen shot of Tintin and Milou (Snowy)In 2013, former New York Times executive editor Bill Keller opined that it is the golden time of news.He acknowledged the explosion of news outlets across various platforms on countless permutations of devices but recognized the diminished presence of foreign bureaus and correspondents around the globe.""Yes, there are fewer and fewer experienced correspondents out there, but I can now access all of them without leaving my desk, and most of this feast will be free,"" he wrote. ""When auto-translate software gets better, I'll even have access to news sources in Persian and Mandarin.""Fair enough.But nothing beats feet on the ground, eyes to observe and record, ears to distinguish variations in tone, human contact, and interaction with different players in a story.Keller, a Russian speaker, said freelance work was traditionally the way to break into international reporting, but had increasingly become THE way into that line of business -- a trend he found disturbing.A foreign assignment at a major news organization has traditionally come with traveling expenses, medical coverage, security and first-aid training if you are covering conflict, fixers and translators and, in a few instances, paid leave for language training. It comes with technicians who make sure your computer and satellite phone work. It comes with lawyers in case you get sued or arrested. It comes with editors who will tell you not to take foolish chances, and notify your family if something bad happens.True. I've been there and done that for newspapers, magazines and international news agencies. It's quite a load on these organizations.Yet one shouldn't minimize the importance of multilingualism, cultural curiosity and sensitivity, a good grasp of history, international relations and economics, top-notch first-aid and security training, media ethics, and, other survival skills needed in foreign and/or hostile environments alongside solid news gathering, writing and digital multimedia proficiency.Far too many ""indies"" are drawn by the notion of exotic adventures without realizing the implications.According to Keller: ""They gravitate to the bang-bang, because that's what editors and broadcast producers will pay for. And chances are that nobody has their backs.""In the Middle East/North Africa region, for example, a number of past and ongoing conflicts have seen scores of non-local journalists and adventure seekers rush to cover the (insert appropriate cliché) event of the day or week before flitting on to the next hot spot with little regard for what impact their coverage will have.The other extreme is of correspondents who stay for years and decades covering a country or region only to be accused of having gone native and skewing their reports although a happy medium does exist.Sadly, the former variety mixed with good and bad citizen journalists using any number of social media and digital tools are taking the lead and their cacophonous content is often deafening and distorted.You don't pick up on nuance or acquire substance at the click of a mouse. Like a good wine it requires depth and maturity.In 2010, Cardiff School of Journalism professor Richard Sambrook wrote ""Are Foreign Correspondents Redundant? The Changing Face of International News."" This insightful Oxford-Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism publication points to the transformation of ""foreign"" reporting, the role of social media in supplementing and complementing traditional news organizations' output, and how outside actors like NGOs and governments are circumventing correspondents by going directly to the public with content.  Screen shot of ""Are Foreign Correspondents Redundant?""Globalization has also led to significant changes in how the world is reported, an executive summary of the report said. In multicultural societies the notion of 'foreign' is more complex. International and domestic news agendas have merged to a significant degree. More organisations are relying on local staff -- with advantages and risks attached.Four years later we also see growing reliance on drones and robo-journalists to collect and curate information. It's a far cry from the golden and privileged days of TIME when my late mentor Wilton Wynn headed the magazine's bureaus in Cairo, Beirut and Rome and was deemed an expert on the Middle East and the Vatican. Wilton Wynn's Vatican reference ""Keepers of the Keys"" (Abu-Fadil) As Sambrook concluded:In future, foreign correspondents are likely to be far more diverse in gender, ethnicity and background. They will speak the language and have specialist knowledge of the country before they are eligible to be appointed. They may well have grown up there or lived there before. They will work to multiple deadlines each day across multiple media (text, audio and video), they will be heavily networked with other specialists and with public sources in their area of expertise. Their network of sources will be counted in the hundreds. Their brief may not be purely geographical, but subject-led as well. They may work for several different organisations as a stringer or freelance rather than being on the staff of one organisation. They are more likely to work from home. They will be addressing multiple audiences around the world and will be aware that they are not the only, or even main, source of information. Their role will be as much about verification, interpretation and explanation as revelation. As such they will need social and collaborative skills. They will take steps to ensure the way they work is as transparent as possible in order to win the trust of editors and the public.So before launching their students on this path, journalism faculty members should consider immersion courses in how to function as 21st Century foreign correspondents and provide initial hands-on training in foreign countries as orientation for what lies ahead.Good preparation is half the battle."

Tamsin Lonsdale, is most definitely not like any ordinary English rose. She is undeniably beyond intelligent, worldly by definition, unique and strikingly beautiful, jet-setting socialite with impeccable taste, witty as you'd expect from a refined English girl to be but yet she remains humble.  My featured interview guest is creative, sharp, and competitive but embodies a balanced personality with compassion, gratitude and sweetness. She is the sort of charismatic friend you'd want to dream up. She is intriguing with extraordinary hostess skills that are at first glance very traditional, like a young Martha Stewart, yet with applaudable freshness and modernity all at once. She's the sort of girl that goes on a hike in the morning, then meets you to go to a strenuous riding lesson in the Malibu summer heat in the afternoon (true story), then off to lunch and still has energy to go on an early evening surf lesson then out to dinner. I envy her peppiness, she barely breaks a sweat while building a huge brand called The Supper Club. She is most definitely the brainy girl that fits the what-it-takes mold to make a cover story of a magazine like Forbes thanks to her own brilliance and single handedly creating a fresh new version of the private members party scene by curating each event to be completely memorable for her members making her company relevant and current year after year. She has lovely baby blue eyes, golden skin from suntan, blonde waves, contagious smile, her famous sultry voice is crisp with a very posh accent. She listens carefully when one speaks to her, and I feel this is because she perceptively studies people. My interview with her is followed by these photo's of Tamsin hosting her events, and of several different Supper Club parties, and a couple of photos of her charming family....

In Hampshire - Jane Austen countryside and the inspiration for many of her novels.How do you think your family & and upbringing shaped your personality?? Quite a lot. We grew up in a liberal household and were sent to the most liberal school in England - Bedales - famous for not having many rules and being progressive with a creative approach to education. My parents were both hippies in the 70s (my mum a fashion model and dad the founder of a chain of denim stores in London named The Jean Machine) and our upbringing (myself and 3 younger sisters) was very relaxed with not so many rules in the household either. All this helped to encourage my entrepreneurial spirit. Inspired by my dad's success as an entrepreneur in the rag trade I always knew that I wanted to work for myself and have my own business, and so I chose to study business and accounting at the University of Edinburgh finishing with a first class degree.Describe yourself at 9 years old, and 15? and what about at 21? At 9 - sweet - I think I was voted the cutest girl in my year at school around this time, at 15 - rebellious, just discovering that there was a life beyond ponies and parents namely parties... at 21 - intrepid adventurer - having caught the travel bug at 18 after spending a year traveling around Australia, I proceeded to explore a whole host of other countries during my holidays at Edinburgh, which spanned almost 4 months every summer - traveling to Morocco, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, The Philippines, Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, Honduras, India, South Africa, Brazil, to name just a few.What was your favorite family vacation as a child? Now as an adult, where do you love to go for relaxation? The Florida Keys- as kids we had a holiday home in Marathon in the Florida Keys, and would holiday there 3 times a year. It was the fondest memories, from fishing with dad to swimming with manatees, long bike rides down to K-mart, collecting hermit crabs, playing tennis at twilight, sailing on the Hobie Cat and eating BBQ'ed lobster on the dock, freshly caught out of the ocean that day. Now as an adult I love to go to Antigua to relax, where my dad has a house. It's like paradise there, so quiet and lush, with beautiful secluded beaches. My favorite things to do whilst there are to get lost in a novel on the beach, go for sunset runs and take the boat out. I also love to go to Aspen, especially for New Years eve. I love to ski and the apres ski is not bad there either.How did you get started hosting these amazing events, and when was The Supper Club born? how did you make it a business? I must have been 13 when I threw my first party - for my birthday, inviting my whole class back to my house for pizza and cola. I have always loved planning dinners and holidays and bringing friends together. It was at Edinburgh University, when I got really into event planning both personally and professionally. For my birthday every year I would rent a big mansion or fort in the Scottish countryside, and invite 50 of my closest friends for a 3 day party, complete with big dinners parties, deejays flown in from Russia, lots of dancing and treasure hunts - and always a theme - from Cowboys & Indians to Boogie Nights and Lord of the Rings. Whilst at university I also started 2 regular clubs night, a trance party held monthly called Aswang, with my best friend Chaz - we'd decorate the club with real ivy and hammocks, and serve spicy chai tea and fruit to guests at the end of the night, and make all of the decor, mainly UV fairies and pixies on giant size drapes. That was a lot of fun. The other club night was an 80s party, called Glitterati, held bi-weekly. When I graduated university I toyed with the idea of working in the city as a management consultant, but decided against that (and pleased I did). I tried my hand in corporate events, property, was a fashion stylist for Italian Vogue and even moved to Cape Town for a year before falling into The Supper Club. At first it was a hobby - I missed the big dinner parties we used to throw at university and meeting new and eclectic friends around the dinner table and wanted to revive this in London which at the time was more about going out to nightclubs, where the music was so loud it was difficult to have a conversation. My first Supper Club dinner party was held in 2004, at my father apartment in London, around an oversized table, for 20 friends. I remember staying up all night the evening before, cooking fish pies in preparation for all of my guests the next night. It was only after a year of organizing these underground dinner parties very much as a hobby, that I realized there was a gap in the market and people would pay a premium for the service I provided. It was then that I decided to set The Supper Club up as a fully fledged business and charge a membership fee. It was an instant hit and after 2 years in London I then took it to New York in 2007 and shortly after that to LA.From small quaint dinner parties to elaborate themed parties, how do you decide what is the next party? Good question - it's more about how I decide what the next 8 parties are though, as we host up to 8 Supper Clubs a month, mainly in NY and LA. Currently I have about 30 events I am planning, as I tend to plan out few months in advance, as well as having private clients ranging from The Guardian Newspaper to America Express. I've also been hired quite a bit to plan our members birthday parties, and a few weddings! There are a few factors though that determine what the new party will be - new restaurant openings (we always like to be the first into these restaurants, makes it an extra special experience and occasion). Most recently we hosted a pop up Supper Club dinner at Botequim, a new Brazilian restaurant just off Union Square in Manhattan. The husband-and-wife restaurant owners, Marco Moreira and Joann Makovitzky were a dream to work with, the food excellent and the setting magical. I also let seasonal social and sporing events dictate my parties, from a 'Brunch at Wimbledon', 'Polo Day Out' and 'London Olympics Viewing Party' to a 'Mad Hatter's Easter Tea Party' and 'Nightmare before Halloween' themed gatherings. I love a good theme and have an endless supply of ideas for these -the limit is my imagination!  It's also important that I see the space first before deciding the theme - most recently we hosted a Summer Solstice celebration in a gorgeous home in the Hollywood Hills, with Villa Maria wines, and it was only after seeing the home that I knew this would be the perfect theme - due to the clean and modern lines of the house, making it perfect for entertaining, killer views and a infinity pool with glass bottom which was just dying to have a mermaid in it! The next themed parties we have coming up that I am most excited about are a Film Noir Garden Party in September at one of our members, Mae Brunken's gorgeous home in the Hollywood Hills. She's a fantastic interior designer, and her house reflects her talents. Often our members love to open up their homes for our events. At the end of July we are hosting a Sustainable Summer Soiree at the founder & CEO of LivingHomes, Steve Glenn's, LEED certified Santa Monica property. I am also really inspired by our Supper Club passport series, where each year we invite members to join us on a number of different exotic holiday locations. Last year we went to Cape Town and Kruger park, and this year we are planning trips to Bali and Morocco.What is your personal favorite style of event or party? I've always love Old Hollywood - you can't beat it, its classic, timeless, and everyone looks glamorous. Masquerade parties are fun too. I also love day time events, from pool parties to sunday brunches.What was your proudest press moment? I loved the write up we received from Joshua David Stein in Page 6 Magazine, as well as the NY Post piece , back when I was launching The Supper Club in NY. I also loved this piece in Brit newspaper the Telegraph written by one of our Supper Club members Sebastian Doggart.You have hosted many celebrities at your parties in the past, which celebrity would you like to host or plan an event for in the future? Hmmm. Good question. Richard Branson, Tim Burton or Baz Luhrmann - The last 2 because they have amazing imaginations and a planning a party for them would need to reflect this. The former (R Branson) because I've always admired him as an entrepreneur, and his mind also seems to have no limits.You traveled a lot, where is your favorite city to live and why? Los Angeles. I've lived in London, Australia, Cape Town, and New York and it was not until I landed in LA that I found the place I was happy to put down roots in. I love the climate, the ocean and healthy lifestyle - it brings my life balance, what with the hectic nature of event planning. I also feel in LA that I get to live my life, rather than my life living me. In LA I get to slow down and focus on other things beyond work. I've learnt to surf and play polo and love going on road trips up to Big Sur and Napa and skiing at the weekends. I've also made incredible friends in LA and my business is really busy.What is your favorite country for vacation? Favorite country would be India - I like Rajasthan best, the colors and spices, it's out of this world and exotic, it feels like a proper holiday, escaping and immersing oneself in a whole new and different culture. I have not been to Costa Rica yet, that's next on my list.What was the most lavish party that you hosted for your members? In London - Mary Greenwell's (make up artist to the star's) birthday party at Beach Blanket Bablyon - inspired by F Scott Fitzgerald - a Beautiful and the Damned birthday party, and we had some many celebrities come, from Uma Thurman to former bond girl Maryam D'abo, Mike Figgis, Jemma and Jodie Kidd to name a few. In Los Angeles - a Black Dahlia themed party- with menu and cocktails to match and lots of entertainment, hosted at Sowden House one of my favorite party locations in LA, a Frank Lloyd Wright designed house and it's also where the Black Dahlia was found murdered, so it was very fitting for our party. In New York - a Jazz-Age picnic held in the garden of a historic Harlem mansion, where we transported guests there on a big red British double deck bus as well as vintage sports cars (for the celebs).What brands have you had a working relationship with in the past that you really loved collaborating with? Pernod Ricard - especially Absolut Elyx. Moet Hennessy - in particular Krug champagne. Bacardi - we recently hosted a spectacular party with Facundo rum. The 86 company - owned by one of my members, Malte Barnekow, as well as tasting good, their packaging is beautiful too - from Fords Gin to Cana Brava Tequila - we've worked with the whole portfolio. Jim Beam's small batch bourbons.Who can be a member at your Supper Club? It's all about personality - we look for those bright shining stars, people that you would naturally gravitate towards at a dinner party - with great energy and charm, style and charisma. Many of our member are the industry leaders as well as rising stars, entrepreneurial in spirit and international, with a hunger for life and experiences.  What are the criteria you look for when looking for a venue to plan the next event? It's important that the venue is excited about working with us, as this translates into the end product 'the event'. Food, atmosphere and service are also all extremely important too and I tend to do a food tasting before an event if I've not dined there yet.What venues do you like to work with most? How is it different than a house party? New restaurants and local neighborhood gems as well as private homes. Private homes make for the best spaces to host our events in, as they deliver a truly unique one-of-a-kind experience, however they are also the most work because you are essentially starting from scratch each time, from bringing in the chef, staff, rentals, valet, entertainment, cleaning crew etc. So I tend to limit these events to once a month, to allow myself breathing room in between.You always impress your members! How do you come up with the next theme? Your recent ""Summer Solstice"" party at the amazing home of Andrew Nikou in Hollywood Hills, you hired an elegant mermaid to swim around the infinity pool all night. Marquis made delicious cocktails like ""Marquis Fleur"" with elderberry, my favorite, and with Owls Brew and Villa Maria Wines, all fit together so elegantly. How do you connect the brands you choose to bring to the particular parties-the entertainment you choose and so forth? In terms of working with brands, we work with many, high end luxury brands, and it's important that we always weave them into our events organically. For our Summer Solstice party we teamed up with Villa Maria wines, who had a whole marketing campaign around the Summer Solstice, so this was just such a natural fit. Their wines are also top notch, so it was nice to treat our members to a sampling of some of their finest vintages.Which activity do you prefer doing on your day off? Hiking, playing polo, riding or surfing? You know me too well - running is a huge passion of mine. I start every day with a long run around Runyon Canyon, it gets the day off on the right foot! I also tend to end the day with a sunset run too, if I have time. I also adore to play polo and show jump, as well as reading, decorating my new home, cooking, road trips and planning the next holiday (I am off to Ibiza and Barcelona later this month).I love Ibiza, we should plan the next one together. You're so competitive when you play polo, when we go riding and your fearless in jumping, do you feel challenging yourself has helped you in your business as well? Yes! I am driven and ambitious, which has been helpful in pushing myself further to take my business further, without this I might never have had the inclination and courage to move from London and open The Supper Club in NY and LA.You make it look so easy, always cool under pressure, but I know you are detail oriented and a perfectionist, how do you look so calm and relaxed at your events? What helps you? what happens if something goes wrong, how do you deal with unforeseen issues? Practice makes perfect and I've been doing it for a while now. I think though, it's because at the end of the day I truly enjoy all of my events, so it does not feel like work. I am lucky in this respect that my job is made up of all of the things I am most passionate about - entertaining, meeting new people, bringing friends together, trying out new places, eating and drinking and traveling the world.Tamsin, what is the difference with your members at your parties in LA, Miami, NY, and London? Not so much. Our members are really international and embody many of the same personality traits - charismatic, interesting, interested, stylish, creative, fun, smart, successful... However in terms of professional fields/industries we tend to have more members in LA in music, art and film, whereas in NY we have more members in finance, fashion, media and design.Which brands do you look forward to working with more in the future? There are so many. I've really been enjoying working with The Guardian recently, creating a custom Supper Club series just for them, as well as the Chef Agency and Audi. I am also looking forward to working more with Jim Beam, Bacardi, and Casamigos ultra-premium Tequila and Matches Fashion.You have been featured in so many magazines and websites, name a few that you personally felt proud to be written in, the recent one for CNN was quite cool... CNN for sure! NY Post, Page 6 Magazine, GQ, Vanity Fair, Telegraph.Your Hollywood Hills house is decorated so impeccably, you're latest hobby seems to be interior design? Is that something that you feel helps you when you are planning a dinner table? Well thank you to Mae Brunken, one of my members, whose been helping me with the interior design of my home...But yes. I am a very creative person. It's in my genes. My whole family is pretty creative. My sister, Chloe, is a fashion designer and owner of MiH Jeans and my other sister, Tahnee, is an incredible artist (I recently commissioned her to do a piece for my home). My events give me a creative outlet - I see them very much as a blank canvas - where the theme, chef, location, and entertainment are the colors making up the final painting. It gives me great satisfaction to see it all come together and the end product being the members having a fantastic time at the event.You are a true fashionista, always so stylish, where do you love to shop most, if anywhere in the world? Beckley, Intermix & Barney's in LA. In NY, I like to wonder around Soho and West Village diving into all the little boutiques, in London - Portobello market and Top Shop.What is your favorite types of music to you listen to? What band do you want to see next in concert? I'm quite eclectic in my music taste, I love bosa nova, in particular Bebel Gilberto who I never get tired of listening to. I love Goldfrapp, Lykke Li, Fleetwood Mac, James Taylor, The Killers, Feist, Carla Bruni, Mystery Jets, Prince, The Cure, MGMT. I also adore jazz music. Whilst I love concerts, I prefer festivals, where over a few days I can watch lots of bands and really relax into the whole experience. We are musical soul-mates! What do you prefer to be in? Heels or flats? Dress or jeans? Skinny jeans, t-shirt and boots in the day, but at night time if I'm going out, definitely heels and a dress.The way you set up your company is brilliant you could literally do Supper Club anywhere in the world which must be so liberating. Did you realize going into this that you would have this sort of freedom? It's priceless... Not so much, unlike most businesses I never had a business plan, it was more organic in the way my company grew. I love the way that I can literally pick anywhere in the world to live and could take the supper club with me, that gives me a tremendous sense of freedom and empowerment. However whilst it may seem like I have a lot of freedom, I am to some extent anchored to the cities my events are in. I host all of my events in LA myself - I think in the last 5 to 6 years I've been in LA, there's only been two dinners I've missed. In NY I personally host one event a month, flying in especially for it. I have a great team in NY that coordinates and hosts the dinners when I am not there.You are a bit of a matchmaker? Yes you could say that. I've got a good eye for matching people up and have quite a few marriages under my belt, especially in London.You are a savvy business woman-yet so much fun to be around, beautiful and quite a catch! If I were a man I would absolutely kidnap you! What do you look for in a relationship? Haha! A man that is passionate, kind, accomplished, generous, stylish, social and smart, and likes to travel.What do you like taking with you when you fly? A good book, magazines, my cashmere blanket and laptop.If you had a pet, what would it be, and what would be it's name? German Shepherd. Rum, or a horse, dying to have a horse.I agree on that, as your humble loyal riding-buddy! So what is next for Supper Club? Possibly opening a bricks and mortar venue in Hollywood, and opening an outpost in SF, as well as brining out a beautiful glossy coffee table book on party themes.What is your all-time favorite film? and book? For books I loved: Papillon a memoir by convicted felon and fugitive Henri Charrière and Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, by David Mitchell. Really anything by David Mitchell is great - loved Cloud Atlas. Hunger Games was also a great read and I love His Dark Materials, an epic trilogy of fantasy novels by Philip Pullman. For movies I loved Vanilla Sky, Elysium, Oblivion, Independence Day, Hunger Games. I really love si-fi and I guess anything with Tom Cruise (laughing).Me too! What do you feel makes a splendid friend? Loyalty and positivity.I cannot agree more!

Tamsin Lonsdale, is most definitely not like any ordinary English rose. She is undeniably beyond intelligent, worldly by definition, unique and strikingly beautiful, jet-setting socialite with impeccable taste, witty as you'd expect from a refined English girl to be but yet she remains humble.  My featured interview guest is creative, sharp, and competitive but embodies a balanced personality with compassion, gratitude and sweetness. She is the sort of charismatic friend you'd want to dream up. She is intriguing with extraordinary hostess skills that are at first glance very traditional, like a young Martha Stewart, yet with applaudable freshness and modernity all at once. She's the sort of girl that goes on a hike in the morning, then meets you to go to a strenuous riding lesson in the Malibu summer heat in the afternoon (true story), then off to lunch and still has energy to go on an early evening surf lesson then out to dinner. I envy her peppiness, she barely breaks a sweat while building a huge brand called The Supper Club. She is most definitely the brainy girl that fits the what-it-takes mold to make a cover story of a magazine like Forbes thanks to her own brilliance and single handedly creating a fresh new version of the private members party scene by curating each event to be completely memorable for her members making her company relevant and current year after year. She has lovely baby blue eyes, golden skin from suntan, blonde waves, contagious smile, her famous sultry voice is crisp with a very posh accent. She listens carefully when one speaks to her, and I feel this is because she perceptively studies people. My interview with her is followed by these photo's of Tamsin hosting her events, and of several different Supper Club parties, and a couple of photos of her charming family....

In Hampshire - Jane Austen countryside and the inspiration for many of her novels.How do you think your family & and upbringing shaped your personality?? Quite a lot. We grew up in a liberal household and were sent to the most liberal school in England - Bedales - famous for not having many rules and being progressive with a creative approach to education. My parents were both hippies in the 70s (my mum a fashion model and dad the founder of a chain of denim stores in London named The Jean Machine) and our upbringing (myself and 3 younger sisters) was very relaxed with not so many rules in the household either. All this helped to encourage my entrepreneurial spirit. Inspired by my dad's success as an entrepreneur in the rag trade I always knew that I wanted to work for myself and have my own business, and so I chose to study business and accounting at the University of Edinburgh finishing with a first class degree.Describe yourself at 9 years old, and 15? and what about at 21? At 9 - sweet - I think I was voted the cutest girl in my year at school around this time, at 15 - rebellious, just discovering that there was a life beyond ponies and parents namely parties... at 21 - intrepid adventurer - having caught the travel bug at 18 after spending a year traveling around Australia, I proceeded to explore a whole host of other countries during my holidays at Edinburgh, which spanned almost 4 months every summer - traveling to Morocco, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, The Philippines, Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, Honduras, India, South Africa, Brazil, to name just a few.What was your favorite family vacation as a child? Now as an adult, where do you love to go for relaxation? The Florida Keys- as kids we had a holiday home in Marathon in the Florida Keys, and would holiday there 3 times a year. It was the fondest memories, from fishing with dad to swimming with manatees, long bike rides down to K-mart, collecting hermit crabs, playing tennis at twilight, sailing on the Hobie Cat and eating BBQ'ed lobster on the dock, freshly caught out of the ocean that day. Now as an adult I love to go to Antigua to relax, where my dad has a house. It's like paradise there, so quiet and lush, with beautiful secluded beaches. My favorite things to do whilst there are to get lost in a novel on the beach, go for sunset runs and take the boat out. I also love to go to Aspen, especially for New Years eve. I love to ski and the apres ski is not bad there either.How did you get started hosting these amazing events, and when was The Supper Club born? how did you make it a business? I must have been 13 when I threw my first party - for my birthday, inviting my whole class back to my house for pizza and cola. I have always loved planning dinners and holidays and bringing friends together. It was at Edinburgh University, when I got really into event planning both personally and professionally. For my birthday every year I would rent a big mansion or fort in the Scottish countryside, and invite 50 of my closest friends for a 3 day party, complete with big dinners parties, deejays flown in from Russia, lots of dancing and treasure hunts - and always a theme - from Cowboys & Indians to Boogie Nights and Lord of the Rings. Whilst at university I also started 2 regular clubs night, a trance party held monthly called Aswang, with my best friend Chaz - we'd decorate the club with real ivy and hammocks, and serve spicy chai tea and fruit to guests at the end of the night, and make all of the decor, mainly UV fairies and pixies on giant size drapes. That was a lot of fun. The other club night was an 80s party, called Glitterati, held bi-weekly. When I graduated university I toyed with the idea of working in the city as a management consultant, but decided against that (and pleased I did). I tried my hand in corporate events, property, was a fashion stylist for Italian Vogue and even moved to Cape Town for a year before falling into The Supper Club. At first it was a hobby - I missed the big dinner parties we used to throw at university and meeting new and eclectic friends around the dinner table and wanted to revive this in London which at the time was more about going out to nightclubs, where the music was so loud it was difficult to have a conversation. My first Supper Club dinner party was held in 2004, at my father apartment in London, around an oversized table, for 20 friends. I remember staying up all night the evening before, cooking fish pies in preparation for all of my guests the next night. It was only after a year of organizing these underground dinner parties very much as a hobby, that I realized there was a gap in the market and people would pay a premium for the service I provided. It was then that I decided to set The Supper Club up as a fully fledged business and charge a membership fee. It was an instant hit and after 2 years in London I then took it to New York in 2007 and shortly after that to LA.From small quaint dinner parties to elaborate themed parties, how do you decide what is the next party? Good question - it's more about how I decide what the next 8 parties are though, as we host up to 8 Supper Clubs a month, mainly in NY and LA. Currently I have about 30 events I am planning, as I tend to plan out few months in advance, as well as having private clients ranging from The Guardian Newspaper to America Express. I've also been hired quite a bit to plan our members birthday parties, and a few weddings! There are a few factors though that determine what the new party will be - new restaurant openings (we always like to be the first into these restaurants, makes it an extra special experience and occasion). Most recently we hosted a pop up Supper Club dinner at Botequim, a new Brazilian restaurant just off Union Square in Manhattan. The husband-and-wife restaurant owners, Marco Moreira and Joann Makovitzky were a dream to work with, the food excellent and the setting magical. I also let seasonal social and sporing events dictate my parties, from a 'Brunch at Wimbledon', 'Polo Day Out' and 'London Olympics Viewing Party' to a 'Mad Hatter's Easter Tea Party' and 'Nightmare before Halloween' themed gatherings. I love a good theme and have an endless supply of ideas for these -the limit is my imagination!  It's also important that I see the space first before deciding the theme - most recently we hosted a Summer Solstice celebration in a gorgeous home in the Hollywood Hills, with Villa Maria wines, and it was only after seeing the home that I knew this would be the perfect theme - due to the clean and modern lines of the house, making it perfect for entertaining, killer views and a infinity pool with glass bottom which was just dying to have a mermaid in it! The next themed parties we have coming up that I am most excited about are a Film Noir Garden Party in September at one of our members, Mae Brunken's gorgeous home in the Hollywood Hills. She's a fantastic interior designer, and her house reflects her talents. Often our members love to open up their homes for our events. At the end of July we are hosting a Sustainable Summer Soiree at the founder & CEO of LivingHomes, Steve Glenn's, LEED certified Santa Monica property. I am also really inspired by our Supper Club passport series, where each year we invite members to join us on a number of different exotic holiday locations. Last year we went to Cape Town and Kruger park, and this year we are planning trips to Bali and Morocco.What is your personal favorite style of event or party? I've always love Old Hollywood - you can't beat it, its classic, timeless, and everyone looks glamorous. Masquerade parties are fun too. I also love day time events, from pool parties to sunday brunches.What was your proudest press moment? I loved the write up we received from Joshua David Stein in Page 6 Magazine, as well as the NY Post piece , back when I was launching The Supper Club in NY. I also loved this piece in Brit newspaper the Telegraph written by one of our Supper Club members Sebastian Doggart.You have hosted many celebrities at your parties in the past, which celebrity would you like to host or plan an event for in the future? Hmmm. Good question. Richard Branson, Tim Burton or Baz Luhrmann - The last 2 because they have amazing imaginations and a planning a party for them would need to reflect this. The former (R Branson) because I've always admired him as an entrepreneur, and his mind also seems to have no limits.You traveled a lot, where is your favorite city to live and why? Los Angeles. I've lived in London, Australia, Cape Town, and New York and it was not until I landed in LA that I found the place I was happy to put down roots in. I love the climate, the ocean and healthy lifestyle - it brings my life balance, what with the hectic nature of event planning. I also feel in LA that I get to live my life, rather than my life living me. In LA I get to slow down and focus on other things beyond work. I've learnt to surf and play polo and love going on road trips up to Big Sur and Napa and skiing at the weekends. I've also made incredible friends in LA and my business is really busy.What is your favorite country for vacation? Favorite country would be India - I like Rajasthan best, the colors and spices, it's out of this world and exotic, it feels like a proper holiday, escaping and immersing oneself in a whole new and different culture. I have not been to Costa Rica yet, that's next on my list.What was the most lavish party that you hosted for your members? In London - Mary Greenwell's (make up artist to the star's) birthday party at Beach Blanket Bablyon - inspired by F Scott Fitzgerald - a Beautiful and the Damned birthday party, and we had some many celebrities come, from Uma Thurman to former bond girl Maryam D'abo, Mike Figgis, Jemma and Jodie Kidd to name a few. In Los Angeles - a Black Dahlia themed party- with menu and cocktails to match and lots of entertainment, hosted at Sowden House one of my favorite party locations in LA, a Frank Lloyd Wright designed house and it's also where the Black Dahlia was found murdered, so it was very fitting for our party. In New York - a Jazz-Age picnic held in the garden of a historic Harlem mansion, where we transported guests there on a big red British double deck bus as well as vintage sports cars (for the celebs).What brands have you had a working relationship with in the past that you really loved collaborating with? Pernod Ricard - especially Absolut Elyx. Moet Hennessy - in particular Krug champagne. Bacardi - we recently hosted a spectacular party with Facundo rum. The 86 company - owned by one of my members, Malte Barnekow, as well as tasting good, their packaging is beautiful too - from Fords Gin to Cana Brava Tequila - we've worked with the whole portfolio. Jim Beam's small batch bourbons.Who can be a member at your Supper Club? It's all about personality - we look for those bright shining stars, people that you would naturally gravitate towards at a dinner party - with great energy and charm, style and charisma. Many of our member are the industry leaders as well as rising stars, entrepreneurial in spirit and international, with a hunger for life and experiences.  What are the criteria you look for when looking for a venue to plan the next event? It's important that the venue is excited about working with us, as this translates into the end product 'the event'. Food, atmosphere and service are also all extremely important too and I tend to do a food tasting before an event if I've not dined there yet.What venues do you like to work with most? How is it different than a house party? New restaurants and local neighborhood gems as well as private homes. Private homes make for the best spaces to host our events in, as they deliver a truly unique one-of-a-kind experience, however they are also the most work because you are essentially starting from scratch each time, from bringing in the chef, staff, rentals, valet, entertainment, cleaning crew etc. So I tend to limit these events to once a month, to allow myself breathing room in between.You always impress your members! How do you come up with the next theme? Your recent ""Summer Solstice"" party at the amazing home of Andrew Nikou in Hollywood Hills, you hired an elegant mermaid to swim around the infinity pool all night. Marquis made delicious cocktails like ""Marquis Fleur"" with elderberry, my favorite, and with Owls Brew and Villa Maria Wines, all fit together so elegantly. How do you connect the brands you choose to bring to the particular parties-the entertainment you choose and so forth? In terms of working with brands, we work with many, high end luxury brands, and it's important that we always weave them into our events organically. For our Summer Solstice party we teamed up with Villa Maria wines, who had a whole marketing campaign around the Summer Solstice, so this was just such a natural fit. Their wines are also top notch, so it was nice to treat our members to a sampling of some of their finest vintages.Which activity do you prefer doing on your day off? Hiking, playing polo, riding or surfing? You know me too well - running is a huge passion of mine. I start every day with a long run around Runyon Canyon, it gets the day off on the right foot! I also tend to end the day with a sunset run too, if I have time. I also adore to play polo and show jump, as well as reading, decorating my new home, cooking, road trips and planning the next holiday (I am off to Ibiza and Barcelona later this month).I love Ibiza, we should plan the next one together. You're so competitive when you play polo, when we go riding and your fearless in jumping, do you feel challenging yourself has helped you in your business as well? Yes! I am driven and ambitious, which has been helpful in pushing myself further to take my business further, without this I might never have had the inclination and courage to move from London and open The Supper Club in NY and LA.You make it look so easy, always cool under pressure, but I know you are detail oriented and a perfectionist, how do you look so calm and relaxed at your events?

I am lucky in this respect that my job is made up of all of the things I am most passionate about - entertaining, meeting new people, bringing friends together, trying out new places, eating and drinking and traveling the world.Tamsin, what is the difference with your members at your parties in LA, Miami, NY, and London? Not so much. Our members are really international and embody many of the same personality traits - charismatic, interesting, interested, stylish, creative, fun, smart, successful... However in terms of professional fields/industries we tend to have more members in LA in music, art and film, whereas in NY we have more members in finance, fashion, media and design.Which brands do you look forward to working with more in the future?

In Hampshire - Jane Austen countryside and the inspiration for many of her novels.How do you think your family & and upbringing shaped your personality?? Quite a lot. We grew up in a liberal household and were sent to the most liberal school in England - Bedales - famous for not having many rules and being progressive with a creative approach to education. My parents were both hippies in the 70s (my mum a fashion model and dad the founder of a chain of denim stores in London named The Jean Machine) and our upbringing (myself and 3 younger sisters) was very relaxed with not so many rules in the household either. All this helped to encourage my entrepreneurial spirit. Inspired by my dad's success as an entrepreneur in the rag trade I always knew that I wanted to work for myself and have my own business, and so I chose to study business and accounting at the University of Edinburgh finishing with a first class degree.Describe yourself at 9 years old, and 15? and what about at 21? At 9 - sweet - I think I was voted the cutest girl in my year at school around this time, at 15 - rebellious, just discovering that there was a life beyond ponies and parents namely parties... at 21 - intrepid adventurer - having caught the travel bug at 18 after spending a year traveling around Australia, I proceeded to explore a whole host of other countries during my holidays at Edinburgh, which spanned almost 4 months every summer - traveling to Morocco, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, The Philippines, Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, Honduras, India, South Africa, Brazil, to name just a few.What was your favorite family vacation as a child? Now as an adult, where do you love to go for relaxation? The Florida Keys- as kids we had a holiday home in Marathon in the Florida Keys, and would holiday there 3 times a year. It was the fondest memories, from fishing with dad to swimming with manatees, long bike rides down to K-mart, collecting hermit crabs, playing tennis at twilight, sailing on the Hobie Cat and eating BBQ'ed lobster on the dock, freshly caught out of the ocean that day. Now as an adult I love to go to Antigua to relax, where my dad has a house. It's like paradise there, so quiet and lush, with beautiful secluded beaches. My favorite things to do whilst there are to get lost in a novel on the beach, go for sunset runs and take the boat out. I also love to go to Aspen, especially for New Years eve. I love to ski and the apres ski is not bad there either.How did you get started hosting these amazing events, and when was The Supper Club born? how did you make it a business? I must have been 13 when I threw my first party - for my birthday, inviting my whole class back to my house for pizza and cola. I have always loved planning dinners and holidays and bringing friends together. It was at Edinburgh University, when I got really into event planning both personally and professionally. For my birthday every year I would rent a big mansion or fort in the Scottish countryside, and invite 50 of my closest friends for a 3 day party, complete with big dinners parties, deejays flown in from Russia, lots of dancing and treasure hunts - and always a theme - from Cowboys & Indians to Boogie Nights and Lord of the Rings. Whilst at university I also started 2 regular clubs night, a trance party held monthly called Aswang, with my best friend Chaz - we'd decorate the club with real ivy and hammocks, and serve spicy chai tea and fruit to guests at the end of the night, and make all of the decor, mainly UV fairies and pixies on giant size drapes. That was a lot of fun. The other club night was an 80s party, called Glitterati, held bi-weekly. When I graduated university I toyed with the idea of working in the city as a management consultant, but decided against that (and pleased I did). I tried my hand in corporate events, property, was a fashion stylist for Italian Vogue and even moved to Cape Town for a year before falling into The Supper Club. At first it was a hobby - I missed the big dinner parties we used to throw at university and meeting new and eclectic friends around the dinner table and wanted to revive this in London which at the time was more about going out to nightclubs, where the music was so loud it was difficult to have a conversation. My first Supper Club dinner party was held in 2004, at my father apartment in London, around an oversized table, for 20 friends. I remember staying up all night the evening before, cooking fish pies in preparation for all of my guests the next night. It was only after a year of organizing these underground dinner parties very much as a hobby, that I realized there was a gap in the market and people would pay a premium for the service I provided. It was then that I decided to set The Supper Club up as a fully fledged business and charge a membership fee. It was an instant hit and after 2 years in London I then took it to New York in 2007 and shortly after that to LA.From small quaint dinner parties to elaborate themed parties, how do you decide what is the next party? Good question - it's more about how I decide what the next 8 parties are though, as we host up to 8 Supper Clubs a month, mainly in NY and LA. Currently I have about 30 events I am planning, as I tend to plan out few months in advance, as well as having private clients ranging from The Guardian Newspaper to America Express. I've also been hired quite a bit to plan our members birthday parties, and a few weddings! There are a few factors though that determine what the new party will be - new restaurant openings (we always like to be the first into these restaurants, makes it an extra special experience and occasion). Most recently we hosted a pop up Supper Club dinner at Botequim, a new Brazilian restaurant just off Union Square in Manhattan. The husband-and-wife restaurant owners, Marco Moreira and Joann Makovitzky were a dream to work with, the food excellent and the setting magical. I also let seasonal social and sporing events dictate my parties, from a 'Brunch at Wimbledon', 'Polo Day Out' and 'London Olympics Viewing Party' to a 'Mad Hatter's Easter Tea Party' and 'Nightmare before Halloween' themed gatherings. I love a good theme and have an endless supply of ideas for these -the limit is my imagination!  It's also important that I see the space first before deciding the theme - most recently we hosted a Summer Solstice celebration in a gorgeous home in the Hollywood Hills, with Villa Maria wines, and it was only after seeing the home that I knew this would be the perfect theme - due to the clean and modern lines of the house, making it perfect for entertaining, killer views and a infinity pool with glass bottom which was just dying to have a mermaid in it! The next themed parties we have coming up that I am most excited about are a Film Noir Garden Party in September at one of our members, Mae Brunken's gorgeous home in the Hollywood Hills. She's a fantastic interior designer, and her house reflects her talents. Often our members love to open up their homes for our events. At the end of July we are hosting a Sustainable Summer Soiree at the founder & CEO of LivingHomes, Steve Glenn's, LEED certified Santa Monica property. I am also really inspired by our Supper Club passport series, where each year we invite members to join us on a number of different exotic holiday locations. Last year we went to Cape Town and Kruger park, and this year we are planning trips to Bali and Morocco.What is your personal favorite style of event or party? I've always love Old Hollywood - you can't beat it, its classic, timeless, and everyone looks glamorous. Masquerade parties are fun too. I also love day time events, from pool parties to sunday brunches.What was your proudest press moment? I loved the write up we received from Joshua David Stein in Page 6 Magazine, as well as the NY Post piece , back when I was launching The Supper Club in NY. I also loved this piece in Brit newspaper the Telegraph written by one of our Supper Club members Sebastian Doggart.You have hosted many celebrities at your parties in the past, which celebrity would you like to host or plan an event for in the future? Hmmm. Good question. Richard Branson, Tim Burton or Baz Luhrmann - The last 2 because they have amazing imaginations and a planning a party for them would need to reflect this. The former (R Branson) because I've always admired him as an entrepreneur, and his mind also seems to have no limits.You traveled a lot, where is your favorite city to live and why? Los Angeles. I've lived in London, Australia, Cape Town, and New York and it was not until I landed in LA that I found the place I was happy to put down roots in. I love the climate, the ocean and healthy lifestyle - it brings my life balance, what with the hectic nature of event planning. I also feel in LA that I get to live my life, rather than my life living me. In LA I get to slow down and focus on other things beyond work. I've learnt to surf and play polo and love going on road trips up to Big Sur and Napa and skiing at the weekends. I've also made incredible friends in LA and my business is really busy.What is your favorite country for vacation? Favorite country would be India - I like Rajasthan best, the colors and spices, it's out of this world and exotic, it feels like a proper holiday, escaping and immersing oneself in a whole new and different culture. I have not been to Costa Rica yet, that's next on my list.What was the most lavish party that you hosted for your members? In London - Mary Greenwell's (make up artist to the star's) birthday party at Beach Blanket Bablyon - inspired by F Scott Fitzgerald - a Beautiful and the Damned birthday party, and we had some many celebrities come, from Uma Thurman to former bond girl Maryam D'abo, Mike Figgis, Jemma and Jodie Kidd to name a few. In Los Angeles - a Black Dahlia themed party- with menu and cocktails to match and lots of entertainment, hosted at Sowden House one of my favorite party locations in LA, a Frank Lloyd Wright designed house and it's also where the Black Dahlia was found murdered, so it was very fitting for our party. In New York - a Jazz-Age picnic held in the garden of a historic Harlem mansion, where we transported guests there on a big red British double deck bus as well as vintage sports cars (for the celebs).What brands have you had a working relationship with in the past that you really loved collaborating with? Pernod Ricard - especially Absolut Elyx. Moet Hennessy - in particular Krug champagne. Bacardi - we recently hosted a spectacular party with Facundo rum. The 86 company - owned by one of my members, Malte Barnekow, as well as tasting good, their packaging is beautiful too - from Fords Gin to Cana Brava Tequila - we've worked with the whole portfolio. Jim Beam's small batch bourbons.Who can be a member at your Supper Club? It's all about personality - we look for those bright shining stars, people that you would naturally gravitate towards at a dinner party - with great energy and charm, style and charisma. Many of our member are the industry leaders as well as rising stars, entrepreneurial in spirit and international, with a hunger for life and experiences.  What are the criteria you look for when looking for a venue to plan the next event? It's important that the venue is excited about working with us, as this translates into the end product 'the event'. Food, atmosphere and service are also all extremely important too and I tend to do a food tasting before an event if I've not dined there yet.What venues do you like to work with most? How is it different than a house party? New restaurants and local neighborhood gems as well as private homes. Private homes make for the best spaces to host our events in, as they deliver a truly unique one-of-a-kind experience, however they are also the most work because you are essentially starting from scratch each time, from bringing in the chef, staff, rentals, valet, entertainment, cleaning crew etc. So I tend to limit these events to once a month, to allow myself breathing room in between.You always impress your members! How do you come up with the next theme? Your recent ""Summer Solstice"" party at the amazing home of Andrew Nikou in Hollywood Hills, you hired an elegant mermaid to swim around the infinity pool all night. Marquis made delicious cocktails like ""Marquis Fleur"" with elderberry, my favorite, and with Owls Brew and Villa Maria Wines, all fit together so elegantly. How do you connect the brands you choose to bring to the particular parties-the entertainment you choose and so forth? In terms of working with brands, we work with many, high end luxury brands, and it's important that we always weave them into our events organically. For our Summer Solstice party we teamed up with Villa Maria wines, who had a whole marketing campaign around the Summer Solstice, so this was just such a natural fit. Their wines are also top notch, so it was nice to treat our members to a sampling of some of their finest vintages.Which activity do you prefer doing on your day off? Hiking, playing polo, riding or surfing? You know me too well - running is a huge passion of mine. I start every day with a long run around Runyon Canyon, it gets the day off on the right foot! I also tend to end the day with a sunset run too, if I have time. I also adore to play polo and show jump, as well as reading, decorating my new home, cooking, road trips and planning the next holiday (I am off to Ibiza and Barcelona later this month).I love Ibiza, we should plan the next one together. You're so competitive when you play polo, when we go riding and your fearless in jumping, do you feel challenging yourself has helped you in your business as well? Yes! I am driven and ambitious, which has been helpful in pushing myself further to take my business further, without this I might never have had the inclination and courage to move from London and open The Supper Club in NY and LA.You make it look so easy, always cool under pressure, but I know you are detail oriented and a perfectionist, how do you look so calm and relaxed at your events? What helps you? what happens if something goes wrong, how do you deal with unforeseen issues? Practice makes perfect and I've been doing it for a while now. I think though, it's because at the end of the day I truly enjoy all of my events, so it does not feel like work. I am lucky in this respect that my job is made up of all of the things I am most passionate about - entertaining, meeting new people, bringing friends together, trying out new places, eating and drinking and traveling the world.Tamsin, what is the difference with your members at your parties in LA, Miami, NY, and London? Not so much. Our members are really international and embody many of the same personality traits - charismatic, interesting, interested, stylish, creative, fun, smart, successful... However in terms of professional fields/industries we tend to have more members in LA in music, art and film, whereas in NY we have more members in finance, fashion, media and design.Which brands do you look forward to working with more in the future? There are so many. I've really been enjoying working with The Guardian recently, creating a custom Supper Club series just for them, as well as the Chef Agency and Audi. I am also looking forward to working more with Jim Beam, Bacardi, and Casamigos ultra-premium Tequila and Matches Fashion.You have been featured in so many magazines and websites, name a few that you personally felt proud to be written in, the recent one for CNN was quite cool... CNN for sure! NY Post, Page 6 Magazine, GQ, Vanity Fair, Telegraph.Your Hollywood Hills house is decorated so impeccably, you're latest hobby seems to be interior design? Is that something that you feel helps you when you are planning a dinner table? Well thank you to Mae Brunken, one of my members, whose been helping me with the interior design of my home...But yes. I am a very creative person. It's in my genes. My whole family is pretty creative. My sister, Chloe, is a fashion designer and owner of MiH Jeans and my other sister, Tahnee, is an incredible artist (I recently commissioned her to do a piece for my home). My events give me a creative outlet - I see them very much as a blank canvas - where the theme, chef, location, and entertainment are the colors making up the final painting. It gives me great satisfaction to see it all come together and the end product being the members having a fantastic time at the event.You are a true fashionista, always so stylish, where do you love to shop most, if anywhere in the world? Beckley, Intermix & Barney's in LA. In NY, I like to wonder around Soho and West Village diving into all the little boutiques, in London - Portobello market and Top Shop.What is your favorite types of music to you listen to? What band do you want to see next in concert? I'm quite eclectic in my music taste, I love bosa nova, in particular Bebel Gilberto who I never get tired of listening to. I love Goldfrapp, Lykke Li, Fleetwood Mac, James Taylor, The Killers, Feist, Carla Bruni, Mystery Jets, Prince, The Cure, MGMT. I also adore jazz music. Whilst I love concerts, I prefer festivals, where over a few days I can watch lots of bands and really relax into the whole experience. We are musical soul-mates! What do you prefer to be in? Heels or flats? Dress or jeans? Skinny jeans, t-shirt and boots in the day, but at night time if I'm going out, definitely heels and a dress.The way you set up your company is brilliant you could literally do Supper Club anywhere in the world which must be so liberating. Did you realize going into this that you would have this sort of freedom? It's priceless... Not so much, unlike most businesses I never had a business plan, it was more organic in the way my company grew. I love the way that I can literally pick anywhere in the world to live and could take the supper club with me, that gives me a tremendous sense of freedom and empowerment. However whilst it may seem like I have a lot of freedom, I am to some extent anchored to the cities my events are in. I host all of my events in LA myself - I think in the last 5 to 6 years I've been in LA, there's only been two dinners I've missed. In NY I personally host one event a month, flying in especially for it. I have a great team in NY that coordinates and hosts the dinners when I am not there.You are a bit of a matchmaker? Yes you could say that. I've got a good eye for matching people up and have quite a few marriages under my belt, especially in London.You are a savvy business woman-yet so much fun to be around, beautiful and quite a catch! If I were a man I would absolutely kidnap you! What do you look for in a relationship? Haha! A man that is passionate, kind, accomplished, generous, stylish, social and smart, and likes to travel.What do you like taking with you when you fly? A good book, magazines, my cashmere blanket and laptop.If you had a pet, what would it be, and what would be it's name? German Shepherd. Rum, or a horse, dying to have a horse.I agree on that, as your humble loyal riding-buddy! So what is next for Supper Club? Possibly opening a bricks and mortar venue in Hollywood, and opening an outpost in SF, as well as brining out a beautiful glossy coffee table book on party themes.What is your all-time favorite film? and book? For books I loved: Papillon a memoir by convicted felon and fugitive Henri Charrière and Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, by David Mitchell. Really anything by David Mitchell is great - loved Cloud Atlas. Hunger Games was also a great read and I love His Dark Materials, an epic trilogy of fantasy novels by Philip Pullman. For movies I loved Vanilla Sky, Elysium, Oblivion, Independence Day, Hunger Games. I really love si-fi and I guess anything with Tom Cruise (laughing).Me too! What do you feel makes a splendid friend? Loyalty and positivity.I cannot agree more!

Israel holds Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and his Palestinian Authority responsible for the safety of three teenagers snatched from the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. AFP PHOTO / JACK GUEZ (Photo credit should read JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cee01f00000002257273.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the Presbyterian Church (USA) made the unprecedented decision to divest from three corporations linked with the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, it marked the first time that a large entity within the United States actively divested millions from those that contribute to the violence and repression against Palestinians. As the Huffington Post reported, they chose Motorola Solutions because the Israeli Defense Force purchases their communication technologies, Caterpillar because its bulldozers have been used to demolish Palestinian homes, and Hewlett-Packard because the Israeli Navy uses its products at checkpoints and to coordinate the blockade of the Gaza Strip. In total, the Presbyterian Church divested $21 million from these three specific companies. While many attempted to downplay this historic move, the world -- including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- took notice. And unlike movements from around the world, this push came from within Israel's biggest ally, the United States. In an effort to counteract this growing rallying cry for Palestinian self-governance and a two-state solution, Netanyahu is now using the tragic death of teenagers to shift the narrative and further reign terror on a minority already living in subjugation. Too bad for him, the world is once again watching.The notion of peace in the Middle East has taken another unfortunate, downward spiral over the last few weeks. When Israeli officials announced on Monday that the bodies of three missing teenagers, Naftali Frankel, Eyal Yifrach and Gilad Shaar, were discovered, both Israelis and Palestinians were mortified, disgusted, saddened and simultaneously fearful of what may transpire next. Contrary to what is often depicted in the media, most Israelis are against the creation of further settlements and are in favor of a two-state solution just as most people around the world are. Many residents of Israel -- I would argue the majority -- do not support their government's tactics of aggression, just as many in the United States do not support our aggression in other sovereign countries (i.e., Iraq circa 2003). But instead of urging calm at such a volatile moment, and instead of releasing facts from an investigation into the deaths of these three innocent boys, Netanyahu doubled down on his heated rhetoric and fulfilled people's worst fears from all sides: an increase in hostility.""Whoever was involved in the kidnapping and the murder will bear the consequences,"" said Netanyahu earlier this week. ""We will neither rest nor slacken until we reach the last of them. And it does not matter where they will try to hide."" What followed was the kind of indiscriminate, blanketed brutal force that has become synonymous with Israel's behavior, and that often keeps Palestinians up at night. Israeli troops conducted countess raids, and arrested and detained hundreds. Israeli jets launched dozens of airstrikes, hitting at least 34 locations the very next morning before dawn. And according to the Washington Post, the United Nations' aid agency in East Jerusalem says that at least seven Palestinians were killed and almost 200 wounded between June 13 and July 1 in the search for the alleged perpetrators. Authorities and medical workers in Gaza place the figure even higher. Without releasing specific details from the investigation, Netanyahu placed blame for the deaths of the three young boys squarely on Hamas. Even when pressed for proof, he and other Israeli leaders simply said that the evidence exists and they were justified to take action. That action has been continuous airstrikes and raids which renewed later in the week, and are taking place even as I write this piece. Contrast that with Netanyahu's reaction to the death of a Palestinian teenager, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, who many believe was killed in a revenge attack. While the Prime Minister condemned the murder and called it ""reprehensible"", he also told people not to jump to conclusions and stated that an investigation would have to be conducted before we could speculate on the perpetrators. He pushed for restraint, but somehow failed to show restraint when ordering airstrikes and raids in Gaza. Do we really believe that innocents have not been killed in that process? Imagine if Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ordered airstrikes into Israel in order to catch the culprits behind Khdeir's death? Do we really think that would fly?The murder of the three Israeli teenagers is unconscionable, horrific and beyond tragic, just as is the murder of the Palestinian teenager. All should be equally condemned. But when the death of children is used to justify further bloodshed, one must question the motives of those taking such actions. For years, nations around the world have been pushing back against Israel's treatment of Palestinians. As I pointed out in a Huffington Post piece in 2011, Palestinians are subjected to daily profiling, second-class status, segregation, routine checkpoints, diminished opportunities, acts of brutal force and more that resemble nuances of apartheid South Africa. And it is this reality that leaves Israel vulnerable to charges of crimes against humanity from the International Criminal Court if Palestinians are able to achieve statehood. That scenario scares many.Just as the global anti-apartheid movement targeted businesses directly contributing to the problem in South Africa, a modern global movement is afoot to push for divestment from those businesses that contribute to the occupation of Palestinians. And for the first time, a major American organization -- a 1.76 million member Church -- has chosen to divest millions of dollars, citing humanitarian reasons as the basis for their decision. Could this be a signal of future divestment movements here at home, similar to the divestment push against apartheid South Africa? Quite possibly. If anyone thinks the Presbyterian Church's decision is miniscule, they are only kidding themselves. There's a reason why many people and organizations descended in Detroit at the Church's General Assembly. And there's a reason why Rabbi Rick Jacobs of the Union for Reform Judaism addressed the Presbyterians twice on the assembly floor against divesting, and even offered to set up a meeting for Church leaders with Netanyahu if they voted the measure down, as the Huffington Post reported. Choosing to divest, or highlighting oppressive acts sanctioned by a government are not anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish in the slightest. The majority of those pushing for an end to the settlements and the creation of a two-state solution -- as the U.S. is -- support two equally autonomous nations. Until the inhumane treatment of Palestinians is ended, Netanyahu cannot play the victim no matter how hard he may try to spin a situation -- even when he disgustingly uses the deaths of innocent teenagers to do so."
9,GREEN,Could This Plan Save The Endangered Florida Panther?,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/endangered-florida-panther_n_5559695.html,,2014-07-05,"WEST PALM BEACH, FL - APRIL 03: A 2-year-old Florida panther is released into the wild by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) on April 3, 2013 in West Palm Beach, Florida. The panther and its sister had been raised at the White Oak Conservation Center since they were 5 months old. The FWC rescued the two panthers as kittens in September 2011 in northern Collier County after their mother was found dead. The panther is healthy and has grown to a size that should prepare him for life in the wild. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb159b726000036008186dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Letitia SteinTAMPA, Fla., July 5 (Reuters) - The endangered Florida panther, running out of room to prowl as its numbers rebound, may find its best chance at survival is a program to pay distrustful ranchers to protect what remains of its habitat.The payment plan proposed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has never been tried before on a large scale with a wide-ranging predator, officials say.Landowners could receive $22 per acre (0.4 hectare) to maintain the cattle pastures and wooded scrub increasingly critical as panther terrain.A growing number of panthers are hemmed into a shrinking corner of southwest Florida, where their ability to roam is threatened by ever expanding subdivisions and highways.Florida panther numbers have more than tripled in recent decades to between 100 and 180, according to government estimates. But state officials say more than twice as many would be needed, in multiple populations, before the species could be downgraded on the endangered list.""It's really about buying us some time,"" said Kevin Godsea, manager for the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge. ""We are never going to be able to purchase all the land that we are going to need to recover the species.""Seventeen panthers already have died this year, mostly hit by cars, putting the year on track to be one of the deadliest for the species in recent history, according to state records.The deaths exacerbate the struggles that panther advocates face in building on past successes. The rebound came after eight Texas pumas were introduced in 1995 to strengthen the Florida panther's genetics. The Florida panther is the last subspecies of puma surviving in the eastern United States.Continuing the progress requires help from private landowners, say wildlife officials, acknowledging that many ranchers resent the official state animal, which can prey on their livestock.Cattle, goats, chicken, turkeys - even cats and dogs - have all been known to become panther prey. It is difficult to prove a big cat killing from a carcass, complicating discussions about reimbursing ranchers for losses.Jack Johnson, a rancher of three decades in rural Immokalee, Florida, said the payment proposal unveiled in late May did little to change his views of the Florida panther as a nuisance.""Ultimately what I think is going to happen?"" he said. ""The three S's are going to be come into play - shoot, shovel and shut up.""It's also unclear how the payments, yet unfunded, would affect other federal farm bill programs, as well as state and private conservation efforts.Wildlife officials would start with a three-year pilot project covering 10 percent of the desirable terrain in private hands, at a total cost of about $1.5 million.But the money would not stop landowners from selling out to development in another decade or two. Conservation groups call the short-term horizon a concern.Still, the proposal is one of the few viable options, said Alexis Meyer, who runs the Florida panther critical habitat campaign for the Sierra Club.The panther, which roamed throughout the southeast, hasn't been welcomed in other states with suitable habitat, she noted.""It really is hard to try and move a large predator,"" she said.

In this false-color image, the faint, blue glow surrounding the dead star is material that was energized by a shock wave, called the forward shock, which was created when the star blew up. The forward shock is now located at the outer edge of the blue glow. Stars are also seen in blue. Green, yellow and red primarily represent material that was ejected in the explosion and heated by a slower shock wave, called the reverse shock wave.

Argentina defeated Belgium 1-0 in the 2014 World Cup quarterfinals at Nacional in Brasilia on Saturday. With the victory, La Albiceleste advanced to the semifinals for the first time since 1990. In Messi's two previous World Cup appearances, his teams had been sent home by Germany in the quarterfinals.The lone goal of the match came in the eighth minute when Argentina forward Gonzalo Higuain, previously scoreless in Brazil, turned a deflected pass beyond Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois with a stunning right-footed shot. The scoring surge began, predictably, with Messi. Argentina's 27-year-old talisman began the scoring sequence after receiving a pass just into Belgium's half of the field. He pirouetted around two defenders as he moved the ball upfield. With the defense focused on his every move, Messi passed the ball to teammate Angel di Maria, stationed wide to his right. Di Maria, who scored the decisive goal against Switzerland in the Round of 16 after receiving a pass from Messi, attempted a through ball for Pablo Zabaleta. The pass was blocked by Belgium defender Jan Vertonghen but dropped for Higuain at the top of the penalty area. Argentina will face either Costa Rica or the Netherlands on Wednesday, July 9 at Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo. "

The money will be matched by contributions from deep-pocketed donors yet to be announced.Mayday.us plans to target five yet-to-be-determined congressional races in the 2014 midterm elections. But in order to get money out of politics, the super PAC ironically needs to secure its own funds. It's trying to raise $12 million overall -- $6 million in crowd-sourced funds and $6 million in matching funds from big donors.If Mayday.us had missed the $5 million goal, all money would have been returned to the donors.“The frustration with the mess we call Congress is palpable, and the desperate urge to do something about it is raw,” Lessig said in the letter on Friday.Mayday.us reached its initial $1 million goal in half the allotted time, despite the fact that its website crashed under the pressure of so many visitors. That amount was matched by contributions from Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, TED’s Chris Anderson, and Union Square Ventures’ Fred Wilson and Brad Burnham. Lessig said that while 2014 would offer a proving ground for the effort to reform campaign finance, supporters may ultimately have to wait until the next election to see any results.""The pundits say 'America doesn’t care about this issue.' This is America caring. And this is America demanding something more. Ideally now. But if we have to wait till 2016, then ok: Because by 2016, we’re going to elect a Congress that will fundamentally change how campaigns are funded. You have guaranteed it,"" Lessig said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the $5 million would be matched by investors Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, Chris Anderson, Fred Wilson, and Brad Burnham. Donors who will match the $5 million round have yet to be announced. We regret the error."
