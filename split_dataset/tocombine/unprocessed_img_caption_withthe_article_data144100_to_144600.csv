Just one year later, they tied the knot. In the October 2013 issue of Town & Country, the couple -- who have been married since 1996 -- recalled the beginnings of their love story. The ""X-Men"" actor explained that in spite of their palpable chemistry, he was hesitant to confess his true feelings because he was embarrassed about falling for the leading lady. Eventually he came clean to Furness, only to discover she felt the same way. Still, he tried to play it cool. “I decided, I won't ask her to marry me for six months,” Jackman told the magazine. “Then after four months I thought, 'That's the most ridiculous rule!'”In August, the actor opened up about how he popped the question. First he set up a table with croissants and flowers next to a lake at a botanical garden, then he led her to the table during a morning stroll.

A study of over 15,000 people found that women were only half as likely as men to be checked for signs of heart disease, which many cardiologists believe is due to doctors missing crucial symptoms when their patients appear well-groomed.""I think doctors -- general practitioners and cardiologists -- often do not realise the risk for women,"" said lead researcher Dr. Pierre Sabouret. ""Too often they will think if a female patient looks healthy, and dresses smartly, and looks after herself, she is probably okay.""It is important to note that the discrepancy is, most prominently, between men and women -- not between well-dressed women and their poorly-dressed counterparts. But the fact of the matter remains that women often alter their appearance with makeup and grooming that make them appear healthier than men.Sabouret says the study's findings are globally applicable, though specifically prevalent in the U.K., where women are one and a half times likelier than men to suffer a fatal stroke. He recommends more rigorous screening procedures and at-home tests. We think the lesson here is clear: Wear sweats to your next doctor's appointment. Some inspiration:Want more?

The comedian took to the stage Tuesday, Sept. 3 at the British GQ Men of the Year awards at The Royal Opera House in London to accept the Oracle Award. Instead of a short ""thank you,"" Brand decided to use the podium to take a jab at Hugo Boss, the event's presenter, the Daily Mail noted. ""Any of you who know a little bit about history and fashion will know that Hugo Boss made the uniforms for the Nazis,"" Brand said. ""The Nazis did have flaws, but, you know, they did look f**king fantastic, let's face it, while they were killing people on the basis of their religion and sexuality."" He then joked about the sales during that era. ""Like, 'We're selling a lot of these... It's flying off the shelves. We had a lot of clients in the 30s and 40s, I can't remember all of them.' Did you make a lot of elasticated crotches, Hugo?"" Brand added, while imitating Hitler and doing the Nazi salute. ""Does it ring any bells?"" Later on in the night, Brand was allegedly kicked out of an after-party because of the Nazi comments, according to the Sun. The company purportedly paid upwards of $390,000 to sponsor the awards show. Still, the 38-year-old Brit defended his comments. Hugo Boss acknowledged the Nazi link back in 1997, the New York Times reported at the time. In the '30s, the clothing company was better known for making uniforms rather than business suits and polos. The company became aware of the connection to Hitler's regime when Boss' name appeared on a list of dormant bank accounts released by Switzerland bankers that year. ''Of course my father belonged to the Nazi Party,'' Siegfried Boss said, according to the New York Times. ''But who didn't belong back then? The whole industry worked for the Nazi Army.''Watch Russell Brand's speech in the video below."

WWD reports that the lawsuit will continue in court, with the date set for October 15th. Ghesquière's ""harmful"" comments were expressed during an interview last spring, following the November decision that he and the fashion house would ""end their working relationship,"" shortly after which he was replaced by Alexander Wang. The interview in question, published in the London-based fashion magazine System (which included the work of Ghesquière's loyal stylist Marie-Amélie Sauvé, who is also named in the suit), included such disgruntled anecdotes as: Over the last two or three years it became one frustration after another ... There was no one helping me on the business side ... They wanted to open up a load of stores but in really mediocre spaces, where people weren’t aware of the brand ... There wasn't really any direction ... I began to feel as though I was sucked dry, like they wanted to steal my identity while trying to homogenize things ...Balenciaga's lawyer, Thierry Lévy, claims that Ghesquière's vitriol constitutes a breach of contract insofar as it is damaging to Balenciaga's reputation in a decidedly sensitive industry. “In general, the parties, knowing the hypersensitivity of the fashion industry to changes in creative direction, were forbidden from commenting on the break in order to avoid any detrimental effect on their economic interests or their image,"" he said in a phone interview with WWD.If Balenciaga is fully victorious in their claim, the judgement will be published in a variety of French fashion and business magazines, which, we suppose, fits quite well with the whole public-shaming in a sensitive industry thing. Revenge is a dish best served in court. To get an idea of what Ghesquière and his ex-house have to look forward to, here are some of the crazier fashion battles of recent years: Want more?
