6,SPORTS,Are We Focusing Too Much Attention On Football Concussions?,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/football-concussion-subconcussive-hits_us_56742a1ce4b0b958f6565152,"As ""Concussion"" sets to premiere, Bennet Omalu and Julian Bailes worry the sport has another head problem.",2015-12-21,"Director Peter Landesman, Dr. Bennet Omalu and Will Smith at a screening of ""Concussion"" on Monday, Nov. 23, 2015, in Los Angeles, CA.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_7_171_3449_1784%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale,"For months now, controversy has followed “Concussion,” the highly anticipated film about the NFL’s concussion crisis, starring Will Smith.The film, which will be released on Christmas day, traces the story of Dr. Bennet Omalu (Smith), the Nigerian forensic pathologist who discovered the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in Pittsburgh Steelers legend Mike Webster after he died. Omalu assumed he would be celebrated for his discovery, which he believed made plain the dangers of football, but soon found himself at odds with a powerful organization that tried to discredit him.Questions have continued to emerge about the film’s accuracy ever since a September story in The New York Times suggested Sony Pictures Entertainment softened the film to avoid conflict with the NFL -- a claim ""Concussion"" director Peter Landesman has repeatedly denied. Just last week, The Times published another story about ""Concussion,"" this one about the family of former NFL player Dave Duerson, who believe the movie misrepresents Duerson's story; the Associated Press quoted researchers who claim Omalu took too much credit for the discovery of CTE. Omalu himself has told The Huffington Post that he believes the film to be accurate, as did Jeanne Marie Laskas, the journalist whose 2009 GQ article about Omalu became the basis for the film, and Julian Bailes, the neurosurgeon who fought to have Omalu's research recognized. “The basic facts are correct,” said Bailes, who is played by Alec Baldwin in the film.Arguments like these over the movie's finer points will likely never be settled -- Bailes admitted that filmmakers did take some small artistic liberties -- but what is less up to debate is this: Today, neuroscientists increasingly have a sense that the very injury that titles the film -- the concussion -- is receiving outsized attention in the battle against brain disease. Lurking alongside it is something much less noticeable but potentially just as harmful: the smaller, near-constant hits to the head inherent to the sport of football. For years now, any discussion of football safety has inevitably come back to the concussion, a mild traumatic brain injury that can lead to symptoms including dizziness, nausea and blurred vision. But in separate conversations with HuffPost, Omalu and Bailes emphasized that there are growing signs that brain disease may not be caused by a handful of concussions, but by the total numbers of blows a football player takes to the head, regardless of whether they cause concussions or not. Hits to the head that don’t lead to diagnosable concussions are called subconcussive, and studies have shown that the average football player will suffer hundreds of them in a single season, and thousands of them over the course of a long career.These hits to the head, which don’t lead to diagnosable symptoms, are what researchers believe will become the real concern in the years ahead.“It is not about concussions,” Omalu insisted to HuffPost. “We now know that all types of repeated blows to the head, no matter how seemingly innocuous, have the potential to cause brain injury.”Bailes, who has worked with Omalu and others on papers related to subconcussive hits, reiterated this point to HuffPost.“There’s a lot of evidence [now] that says it’s not just a recognized or known concussion [that’s the problem],” said Bailes, who is now co-director of the NorthShore Neurological Institute. “It’s the exposure to repetitive brain impact.”In recent years, the general public has come to understand that football is dangerous, a result of the hard work of people like Omalu and Bailes. Multiple surveys have found that roughly half of those polled would rather not have their children play the sport.Landesman is one such person. The ""Concussion"" director played football in high school and college. He cheered when the New York Giants beat the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl. But while researching the dangers of the sport for the movie, something in him changed.“Now that I know too much about what happens to these guys, I can no longer watch without feeling complicit,” Landesman told HuffPost. “I start to feel like I’m part of the problem instead of the solution.”“I would not let my child play football,” he added. “Not in any way.”The newfound understanding of the dangers of football by people like Landesman is a victory for public health advocates. But whether because of scientists, the media or others, the country has collectively zeroed in on the concussion as the root problem. Football organizations, from youth leagues to the NFL, have spent years implementing and perfecting procedures to identify concussion symptoms and pull athletes. Football's crisis has been called the ""concussion crisis.""This has frustrated researchers, who are having trouble getting across the message about subconcussive hits. On June 25, 2014, Robert Stern, a professor of neurosurgery at the Boston University School of Medicine and the director of clinical research at the Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center, expressed his irritation in written testimony provided to the United States Senate’s Special Committee on Aging (emphasis ours):Over the past few years, there has been a tremendous increase in public awareness of concussions and the need to prevent and manage them. The “concussion crisis” in sports is a hot topic in the media, on playing fields, and in doctor’s offices. However, when it comes to the long-term consequences of sports-related brain trauma, concussions are likely the tip of the iceberg. That is, subconcussive trauma appears to be as important or more important [than concussions] in the development of CTE.Ann McKee, one of the Stern’s colleagues, is at the forefront of football's CTE crisis. A professor of neurology and pathology Boston University of School of Medicine, McKee and her research team in Boston made headlines in September when they announced that they had discovered signs of CTE in 87 of 91 deceased former NFL players.But in a conversation with HuffPost, McKee reiterated Omalu's and Bailes’ argument that there is increasing evidence that concussions aren't the only or even root concern. Her research has yet to discover a direction correlation between the number of diagnosed concussions and the severity of CTE, but she said there are strong signs of an association between the length of exposure to subconcussive injuries and brain disease.“So, research is really pointing in the direction of exposure [to total hits],” she said. “Not the number of isolated concussions.”Should researchers in coming years more definitively determine that brain disease is linked to the total number of hits to the head a football player experiences, no matter the degree, it could be an even larger blow to football than the one it received at the beginning of the century, when a little-known scientist in Pittsburgh named Bennet Omalu discovered something odd in the brain of recently deceased NFL legend Mike Webster. At least concussions can be diagnosed and recorded. What can you do about the sort of hits that so many players incur so many times every game?Today, Bailes is the medical lead for Pop Warner football, the oldest and largest youth football league in the country, and he’s more optimistic than most that the sport will be able to become safer in recent years. But he’s still honest with himself when it comes to where football ranks among other sports in terms of its potential dangers.“Football is the worst, because hitting your head, hitting the helmet and cranium repetitively hundreds or thousands of times a year is part of the play,” he said. “The same thing happens in the others, soccer or hockey, but it’s not so intentional.""“And it’s not every play.""Also on HuffPost:"

An internal report from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services warned that lead poisoning rates ""were higher than usual for children under age 16 living in the City of Flint during the months of July, August and September, 2014.""In April 2014, city and state officials switched Flint's water source from Detroit's water system to the Flint River, immediately prompting citizen complaints about tap water quality.Edwards led a team that conducted its own analysis of Flint's water, reporting high lead levels in early September of this year. Brad Wurfel, spokesman for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, essentially dismissed the allegations in an interview with Michigan Radio, saying the state's analysis of blood data didn't show any signs of a problem. The government continued to insist that the water was safe until a Flint pediatrician with the Hurley Medical Center reported later in September that the water change corresponded with a significant spike in lead poisoning among city children.However, the memo obtained by Edwards suggests the state knew about the lead poisoning weeks earlier, yet continued to say the water was okay.""They discovered scientifically conclusive evidence of an anomalous increase in childhood lead poisoning,"" Edwards wrote Monday on the website he created to track Flint's water crisis, ""but stood by silently as MDEQ officials repeatedly and falsely stated that no spike in blood lead levels (BLL) of children had occurred."" Reached for comment on Monday about the memo, Michigan's DHHS said it had made an honest mistake by attributing the spike in blood lead levels to seasonal variation.""When initially looking at the citywide and county elevated blood lead level numbers, the increase appeared to be consistent with the routine seasonal fluctuation seen in the summer months,"" agency spokeswoman Jennifer Eisner said in an email. ""It wasn’t until the Hurley report came out that our epidemiologists took a more in-depth look at the data by zip code, controlling for seasonal variation, and confirmed an increase outside of normal trends.""The July 2015 memo didn't indicate definitively what had caused the higher lead levels in the children's blood, nor did it show elevated lead for subsequent months. Other emails obtained by Edwards indicate that the data had been sent to the director of the DHHS, as well as to the office of Gov. Rick Snyder (R), sometime between July and September.The county declared a public health emergency and told people to stop drinking the water in October of this year. And Snyder, who appointed emergency managers overseeing the city's switch to the Flint River as its water source, has signed legislation returning Flint to Detroit's water system. The governor also appointed a task force to investigate what went wrong. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible health and behavioral problems, and children exposed to too much lead can permanently lose IQ points. The lead author of the Hurley report, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, joined the ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast, to talk about Flint's lead poisoning crisis:"
9,POLITICS,Here's What The First 100 Days Of A GOP Presidency Could Look Like,"Mariam Baksh, Ruby Mellen, and Philip Lewis",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-presidency-100-days_us_565dd5a6e4b08e945fecad06,Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes.,2015-12-21,Demonstrators appeal to the Supreme Court to implement President Obama's immigration reforms.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/566609d8160000290094bde5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The various GOP presidential hopefuls, like all politicians since time immemorial, have made a lot of promises this campaign season. Here are some of the things they've vowed to do if they make it to the White House.Reverse action on climate change.Republicans across the board have sworn to roll back the country's efforts to mitigate climate change, despite polls showing that a majority of Americans are in favor of addressing the problem. First to go would be the Clean Power Plan, which the Environmental Protection Agency announced in August. The plan would cut carbon emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and enable the U.S. to meet its current commitments to the United Nations.Every GOP candidate running for president has come out against the Clean Power Plan. Even former New York Gov. George Pataki, who has supported other measures to rein in climate change, told Bloomberg in August that the Clean Power Plan “is a classic top-down, government-imposed solution"" that will ""result in higher costs of energy [and] an increase in the vulnerability of the electrical supply, and I think it's just completely wrong.” Other candidates have taken a harder line against the Clean Power Plan, and indeed against all executive actions taken by President Barack Obama.“If you live by the pen, you die by the pen,” Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) told The Washington Post in June for an article about what his first 100 days would look like. So there's that.Repeal Obamacare.After two years of sign-ups following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, more than 16 million people now have health insurance who didn’t have it before. But every GOP candidate except Ohio Gov. John Kasich has promised to repeal Obamacare -- though for the most part, they've been pretty vague about what would take its place.“[I'd] figure out a way to repeal Obamacare,” former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said at a roundtable in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, this May, responding to a question about actions he’d take in his first 100 days. “I think repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a 21st-century consumer-directed, patient-driven health care insurance system has to be a high, high priority.”Deport, deport, deport.Last year, Obama bolstered the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and initiated a new one: Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents. These actions would defer the prosecution of childhood arrivals to the U.S. for two years and allow the parents of any U.S. citizen or resident to live and work in the country without fear of deportation -- meaning that 6.3 million U.S. citizens wouldn’t have to see their families dismantled.But the Republican presidential candidates have opposed this, for the most part characterizing it as executive overreach, a la Cruz, who called the measure “patently unconstitutional.” Real estate mogul Donald Trump has been the most aggressive candidate on immigration. He has repeatedly promised that his plan to lead the forceful removal of 11 million immigrants, reminiscent of a 1954 program called “Operation Wetback,” would be done in “a very humane way.” Experts say that’s not possible. Make America ""great"" again, and make China a loser.On Trump’s campaign website, the candidate promises to take swift action against China for not playing fair: “On day one of the Trump administration the U.S. Treasury Department will designate China as a currency manipulator.”Democrats like Sen. Charles Schumer (N.Y.) would rejoice. He and many in Congress agree that China’s intervention in the world’s currency market is stifling U.S. exports and costing the country millions of manufacturing jobs. China deliberately devalues its currency -- which should be traded at the highest rates, because it’s in greatest demand by all the countries that need to buy China’s exports in the local currency -- by using its massive reserves to buy up U.S. dollars. This lowers the supply of the dollar compared to the Chinese yuan, which makes U.S. exports more expensive, and therefore tougher to sell.The U.S. trade deficit “has increased by $200 billion to $500 billion per year as a result,” according to a 2012 report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The United States has lost 1 million to 5 million jobs due to this foreign currency manipulation.”Earlier this year, the International Monetary Fund declared China’s currency “fairly valued.”Remind Congress that it's super important for everyone to get along.In response to a question about how his first three months in office would be unique, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson said at a National Press Club event that he would call a joint session of Congress to address hyper-partisanship in the legislature, stressing the importance of Judeo-Christian values.“We've gotten to the point where we believe that if somebody disagrees with you, then you need to try to destroy them, destroy their family and their livelihood,” Carson said. “Where did that come from? I guarantee you, it did not come from our Judeo-Christian values and roots.”Wage yet another war against same-sex marriage.This summer, a week after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said he would not accept the ruling. ""I reject this decision and will fight from 'Day One' of my administration to defend our Constitution and protect religious liberty,"" Huckabee said of the Supreme Court's ruling in a press release.On his website, Huckabee promises to push for a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman. Those efforts would likely be a waste of time, since a constitutional amendment requires a two-third majority in Congress -- or in a state vote -- and same-sex marriage currently enjoys record-high support among Americans.Roll out the red carpet for Wall Street, and let them wipe their feet on consumers.Everyone in the GOP field has promised to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act, which put into place a package of Wall Street regulations following the 2008 financial meltdown. Dodd-Frank also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to act as an arbiter for the public in the face of unscrupulous business practices.In July, Carson wrote in a Washington Times op-ed that the CFPB is “the ultimate example of regulatory overreach, a nanny state mechanism asserting its control over everyday Americans that they did not want, did not ask for and do not need.” For what it's worth, the CFPB has secured over $10 billion in relief for consumers since its creation in 2011. It's currently addressing the student debt crisis by suing for-profit colleges for fraud and taking on the country’s largest student loan company for allegedly cheating borrowers. Reduce college student loan debt by discouraging liberal arts degrees.Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), who has voted consistently against Dodd-Frank and the CFPB, said in November that within his first 100 days as president, he would deal with the student debt issue by adjusting the academic accreditation system to incentivize low-cost training of professions like welding, rather than philosophy degrees, for example.Renege on the Iran deal.GOP candidates Rubio, Cruz, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and former Sen. Rick Santorum (Pa.) have all promised to immediately undo an international agreement that lifts financial sanctions on Iran in exchange for constraints on uranium enrichment programs meant for the development of atomic weapons.Expressing dissatisfaction with the deal in September, Fiorina said the first thing she'd do in the Oval Office would be to make two phone calls. The first would be to reassure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of America’s support. The second would be a message to Iran’s supreme leader: “Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime, anywhere, for-real inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.""End mass government surveillance?Rand Paul's staunch opposition to the government collecting metadata from U.S. citizens is one reason the Kentucky senator may not win the Republican nomination in a time of heightened concern over national security. To date, he’s been the only person in the field who's argued that privacy should win out.“The president created this vast dragnet by executive order,” Paul said at the beginning of his campaign. “As president, on day one, I will immediately end this unconstitutional surveillance.”Boost cybersecurity, somehow.Carson has said he would prioritize tightening cybersecurity, although he's been less specific about it than some critics would like.“We must immediately harden our electrical grid and have multiple layers of alternative energy,” Carson told The Washington Examiner in September. “That's critical ... We also must beef up our cyber capabilities both offensive and defensive.”Keep former lawmakers from going straight to K Street.Pataki has taken a strong stance on eliminating the “revolving door” between lawmakers and lobbyists, though he's in the minority as far as actually making this a campaign issue.In September, Pataki said he would “propose a law on day one"" of his presidency: ""You serve one day in the House or Senate, there’s a lifetime ban on you ever being a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.”Invade Chinese airspace with Air Force One.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie would solve U.S. challenges with China by flying Air Force One over military installments in the South China Sea to show them “we mean business.”At the undercard GOP debate in November, Christie said this would be the first thing he would do when it comes to China -- surely a smart way to establish a good rapport with the United States' primary trading partner.Send Vladimir Putin a message -- that we're gonna keep doing what we've been doing.Fiorina pledged at a town hall meeting in August to address the threat of Russia by ""rebuild[ing] the 6th Fleet,"" a part of the U.S. Navy that conducts operations in Europe and Asia. But as Vox's Ezra Klein points out, the 6th Fleet doesn't actually need rebuilding. In fact, most of what Fiorina has promised to do regarding Russia in her first 100 days, including starting military exercises in the Baltic States and putting more troops in Germany, are things the Obama administration is doing or has already done. Balance the budget, by sheer force of will.Never fear! Amid all the flurry, Kasich has promised he'll manage to balance the budget, using... methods.""I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio. And I will go back to Washington with my plan. And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass, and we will be strong again,” Kasich said during an October GOP debate. “Thank you.""No, governor, thank you."

Graham was elected to represent South Carolina in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 and won one of the state's U.S. Senate seats in 2002.

None of the answers broke new ground on the policy front, with each calling for more resources for treatment and a shift away from a criminal justice-first approach. Hillary Clinton said that she regularly hears from people hit by the crisis and as a result created a five-point plan to address it. Vermont's Bernie Sanders (I) said that a ""variety of treatments"" ought to be available to those addicted, presumably a reference to a debate within the community over whether strict abstinence is the only acceptable route to recovery, or whether medications such as methadone or Suboxone should be allowed -- a debate highlighted earlier this year in an in-depth HuffPost investigation. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who has extensive experience with the issue given the problems plaguing Baltimore, had the most specific response, highlighting the value of intervening when an addict arrives at an emergency room (which sounds like common sense, but often they are ignored or turned away with perfunctory treatment). He also described two overdose deaths of people connected to him.Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) agree that the United States shouldn't be the world's only developed country with no guaranteed paid family leave policy. But they have very different visions for how such a program should be funded. During the Democratic presidential primary's third debate Saturday evening, Clinton gave Sanders an opening to criticize her mechanism for funding paid leave when she pledged that she would not raise taxes on those making less than $250,000 a year were she elected president.""I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle-class families' taxes,"" she said. ""I don't think a middle-class tax should be a part of anybody's plans right now.""Sanders argued that Clinton's promise was inherently at odds with the Democratic Party's legacy.""When Secretary Clinton says, 'I'm not going to raise taxes on the middle class,' let me tell you what she is saying,"" Sanders said. ""She is disagreeing with FDR and Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and Senate who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.""Sanders pointed out that the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in Congress' upper chamber, would increase the payroll taxes for workers and companies by 0.2 percent, or roughly $1.38 a week for the median wage earner. He is one of the bill's co-sponsors. ""Now you can say that's a tax on the middle class. It will provide three months' paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country,"" he said.Clinton objected to Sanders' suggestion that she was wrong on the issue. Though she hasn't yet released her specific proposal for paid family leave, she and her aides have said it would be funded by raising taxes on the wealthy.""Senator, I have been fighting for paid family leave for a very long time. I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it, not everybody else,"" she said.Also on HuffPost:"

Trump, the Republican frontrunner, said in a separate interview on the same show.Though they agree on little else, both the Democratic challenger and Trump appeal to voters who view the 2003 invasion of Iraq as a mistake and are leery of getting too deeply involved in the region.Sanders, seeking to bite into frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s big lead in the November 2016 Democratic White House race just six weeks before the first nominating contest in Iowa, has criticized her for being too quick to intervene in the Middle East.He has repeatedly reminded voters of Clinton's support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which she has since called a mistake and has been critical of her support for the speedy departure of Assad, who has resisted all diplomatic efforts to leave power with a civil war raging in his country and swathes of territory controlled by Islamic State, also known as ISIS.The U.S. bombing of Libya in 2011 when Clinton was Secretary of State hastened Gadaffi's downfall but created a vacuum which is being filled by extremist groups, the Vermont senator said.""Gaddafi, terrible dictator, gotten rid of,"" Sanders said. ""Right now, ISIS is gaining ground in Libya because of all of the destabilization in the region and all of the turmoil.""Trump has sought to appeal to hawkish Republican voters by criticizing the Obama administration for not pressing the fight against Islamic State aggressively enough.At the same time, he has criticized Republican rivals such as former Florida Governor Jeb Bush who believe that Assad must go, warning that regime change can lead to unintended consequences.""Every time we get involved with rebels ... it ends up being far worse than the people who were there in the first place,"" he said.Sanders and Trump both said the United States should focus on defeating Islamic State rather than trying to oust Assad at the same time.""I don't agree with him on much, but if he says that, I'm okay with it,"" Trump said, referring to Sanders.(Reporting by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Alan Crosby)Also on HuffPost:"
16,POLITICS,Watch Bernie Sanders And Hillary Clinton Slam Martin O'Malley,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-sanders-omalley-gun-control_us_56760b8ce4b06fa6887daaa7,They reacted after O'Malley accused them of flip-flopping on gun control.,2015-12-20,1981: The Attempted Assassination Of President Ronald Reagan,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587a8abe1200002d00ad7981.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley on Saturday attacked Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton for their respective records on guns.During the Democratic debate on ABC, Clinton received a question about the role of gun control in countering terrorism and declined to attack Sanders, as she has in the past.O’Malley showed no such reticence.“Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill,” O’Malley noted. “Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers. And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.”The Brady Bill, named for the assistant to President Ronald Reagan who was shot and paralyzed in 1981, mandated background checks for gun purchases. Sanders has said he opposed it at the time because a version of the bill would have mandated national background checks.O’Malley then pivoted to criticize Clinton who he said had only supported gun control when it was politically convenient.“Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don’t need federal standards,” O’Malley continued. “What we need on this issue is not more polls. We need more principle.”O’Malley then touted his own record of passing more restrictive gun safety laws in Maryland. His state’s assault weapons ban, he said, might have stopped the man who bought assault rifles for the San Bernardino attackers from doing so.When pressed, however, O’Malley declined to endorse collecting the assault weapons already in circulation.But when he again blamed ""the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there,” those colleagues interjected.“Whoa whoa whoa, let’s calm down a little bit, Martin,” Sanders said.“Let’s tell the truth, Martin,” Clinton added.“I am telling the truth,” O’Malley shot back.“Let’s start by maybe having some rules here,” Sanders said.Sanders retook the floor, emphasizing a familiar theme in his discussion of gun policy: that he is uniquely qualified to build a consensus on gun control, given his political base in Vermont where there are lax gun laws.“We can do all the great speeches we want -- we ain’t gonna succeed unless there is a consensus,” Sanders said.He invoked his opposition to assault weapons and subsequent 1988 loss in a race for a congressional seat as evidence of his commitment to gun safety.“So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where Democratic governors and Republican governors have supported virtually no gun control... Do not tell me that I have not shown courage!” Sanders insisted, his voice raised.Clinton, for her part, made a rare acknowledgment that Sanders had become more supportive of gun control, while admonishing him to back efforts to end the default-to-sale background check loophole and repeal civil legal liability for gun makers, wholesalers and retailers.“I am glad to see that Senator Sanders has really moved on this issue in the face of the facts about what we’re confronting in this country,” she said. “I would hope that he has said in the past two debates that he wants to take on this immunity issue... and I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity” for gun makers and sellers.“Only the three of us will do this -- nobody on the Republican side will admit that there’s a problem,” Clinton concluded.Sanders has said he would re-examine the 2005 law he voted for that grants gun and ammunition makers, wholesalers and retailers broad civil liability from harm caused using their products, but declined to endorse repealing the law entirely. He did not say he would repeal it on Saturday night, either.Also on HuffPost:"

Shaima Qassim, a 20-year-old economics student from Kirkuk, clinched the shimmering gold-and-crystal crown Saturday after outshining more than 150 candidates -- and overcoming death threats that reportedly caused many others to drop out.Since the pageant’s last winner in 1972, the event had been canceled amid unrest in the Middle East. Over the years, other pageants had been held under different names, but none of these contests were in accordance with international standards, NBC reported.This year's Miss Iraq event was constructed in a way that would allow its winner to potentially go on to compete internationally, with pageants like Miss World having removed the swimsuit segment of its competition in late 2014.Even after the Miss Iraq pageant cut swimsuits from the contestants’ generally conservative attire, religious extremists threatened violence, forcing the pageant to be pushed back two months in October, The Independent reported.Fifteen aspiring beauty queens dropped out over threats, Iraqi fashion designer Senan Kamel, a pageant spokesman and judge, told NBC in October.In the end, Saturday night saw eight brave and beautiful finalists strutting across a Baghdad hotel’s stage in high heels and sleeveless ― but below-the-knee ― evening gowns.“I’m very happy to see Iraq going forward,” Qassim told Agence France-Presse shortly after her crowning before a room full of jovial admirers with armed guards at the door. “This event was huge and put a smile on the faces of the Iraqis.”The green-eyed stunner, speaking to NBC in October, said that like the other candidates, she has been personally affected by the ongoing violence in their area.Two of her cousins were serving Iraq’s federal police when they were killed while fighting ISIS militants, she said.""Our people are badly in need of such cultural activities,"" she said. ""After all we have been through, we need to do something new that would reform our society.""Qassim said she will use her title toward educational initiatives, particularly among those displaced by conflict.Also on HuffPost:"
18,QUEER VOICES,Caitlyn Jenner's Prayer With Anti-LGBT Rights Pastor Ignites New Criticism,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/caitlyn-jenner-houston-pastor_us_5676cdc1e4b0b958f657036e,Activists say the trans reality TV star's visit to Houston was a publicity stunt and not inclusive.,2015-12-20,Transgender reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner is facing a new wave of criticism after praying with an anti-LGBT-rights pastor in Houston.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586c09801900002a000e2bc4.jpeg?cache=4DCUpS2XMM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Caitlyn Jenner is once again in hot water -- this time for praying with an anti-LGBT-rights pastor.The reality star was photographed Thursday in prayer with controversial Houston pastor Dr. Ed Young after the Second Baptist Church’s Christmas pageant. Critics pounced, saying the meeting was a publicity stunt and not inclusive enough. ""Dad has always taught me to love everyone,” Young’s son, Ed Young Jr., tweeted Friday with a photo of the two praying.The elder Young, who oversees the nation’s largest Baptist church, has been an outspoken critic of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, which would have prevented discrimination against LGBT people in the city but was defeated in November 2015.The 79-year-old went so far as to call the ordinance ""godless"" in one of his sermons in September, according to Fox26.That comment led dozens of local gay, lesbians and trans people to attend services at Young’s megachurch in hopes of sending the message, “we’re everywhere,” one activist told KHOU late last month.The former Kardashian patriarch clearly echoed that message this week, appearing to turn the other cheek while united by prayer with Young.But not everyone saw the move as inspiring and heartwarming.Former county GOP chair Jared Woodfill criticized the visit as a publicity stunt.""You don't go to a kids' Christmas play and use that as a vehicle to send your message. That's just plain wrong,"" he told ABC13.Jenner's reality TV crew accompanied her on her Houston visit, ABC13 reported.Transgender activist Kate Bornstein, who said she witnessed Jenner’s appearance, defended her, tweeting: “The exchange [between] Pastor Ed Young & @Caitlyn_Jenner wasn't filmed or recorded by TV crew—I have a clip on my iPhone.""Bernstein further said she was proud of Jenner, claiming that Jenner addressed Young’s hateful rhetoric to his face.""Proud of @Caitlyn_Jenner, saying to @EdYoung's father's face that the pastor's #transphobic hate videos r highly offensive to all #trans ppl,” she tweeted.Local black trans activist and blogger Monica Roberts also branded Jenner’s appearance a failure in a post titled ""Caitlyn Comes To H-town, Screws Up Again.""""Unfortunately, whatever good will she earned from that initial coming out ESPY speech is rapidly dissipating,"" Roberts wrote, speaking of the Olympic gold medalist’s mainstream recognition as a transgender trailblazer.Roberts complained that Jenner did not include people of color in the documentation of her visit, as seen in her ""melanin free photo,"" as the blogger put it.""The problem I have with it along with many of our allies is that the taping had no Houston trans representation, and especially Houston trans people of color,"" she wrote. She expressed upset that local HERO activists were not given a chance to speak on camera about the ordinance.Since becoming an unofficial emblem of the trans community, the 66-year-old Jenner has received perhaps as many accolades as criticism. Earlier this month she was lambasted for saying she's ""comfortable"" with human rights issues in the U.S. during an interview with the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, Samantha Power. LGBT website Towleroad said Jenner discredited the lives impacted by violence within the U.S. transgender community.When Jenner reaffirmed her Republican voting ticket, the website branded her a ""Republican hypocrite,"" criticizing GOP presidential candidates' anti-LGBT statements on the campaign trail.After being recognized at the 2015 Glamour Women of the Year awards in November, she also faced public criticism for her answer to BuzzFeed to the question, “What’s the hardest part for you about being a woman?”“The hardest part about being a woman is figuring out what to wear,” she responded.In a Dec. 14 blog post, Jenner addressed her critics, writing that she's ultimately ""tried to be a force for good.""""I am guessing this is probably not the last time I will say the wrong thing, or say something the wrong way. I promise to keep learning, and to try to be more articulate in the future,"" she wrote. ""We have a lot of hard work to do. I am looking forward to doing it together.""Also on HuffPost:"

Filmed to look like the ""Bad Blood"" music video, Fey and Poehler appear in an array of superhero-meets-sex vixen outfits, while they sing about the ""dope"" women (and a man, too!) in their lives. Everyone from Fey's and Poehler's nannies and their gynecologist (yes, they share one, as BFFs do) to Fey's mammogram technician are part of their real, down-to-earth crew.

Swift, being Swift, hit back at the hosts by quoting Katie Couric in a Vanity Fair interview.""There's a special place in hell for women who don't help other women,"" the pop star said.The following year, when Fey and Poehler returned as hosts for the 2014 Golden Globes, the ""30 Rock"" star threw another apparent jab at the songstress. Onstage, Fey congratulated Poehler on her first Golden Globe nomination by saying, ""I just want to say congratulations again to my friend Amy Poehler.

In a sketch titled ""Meet Your Second Wife,"" Poehler and Fey host a game show that introduces three ""happily married men"" to their future second wives. One by one, the unsuspecting husbands watch as increasingly younger girls are paraded on stage in front of their current spouses.And by young, we mean really young. When Bobby Moynihan's 12-year-old second wife walks on stage, his horrified expression encapsulates our reaction to the creepy -- albeit hilarious -- sketch.Moynihan refuses to believe that he would ever leave his wife, let alone for an underage girl, until Fey asks, ""But what if I told you that in a few years one of your novels becomes a surprise bestseller and is even optioned for a movie?”“Oh yeah, then yeah, no, I get it now,” he immediately responds. Next, a 5-year-old girl and then an unborn fetus are presented as the future wives of the last two contestants. ""SNL"" is obviously skewering the older man/younger woman pairing -- pretty well, we might add -- but did the sketch need to go that young to prove its point?

Not just the shopping, the eating too. For anyone trying to lose or maintain their weight, it's a time of quiet terror. It always was for me. That is, until I figured out the formula. Now every holiday season I lose two pounds and still get to indulge in all my favorite goodies. There's no need to deny yourself a taste of those things that come but once a year. Go ahead and indulge. The key word here is indulge -- not over-indulge. You can still lose weight, and not by magic or drugs or extreme exercise. If you have a relatively normal metabolism, you can lose weight by following a simple formula supported by research at the Mayo Clinic. This video lays out the formula. Remember this formula is an approximation and varies from person to person.Here's the same formula adding in holiday goodies · One lb = 3500 calories. · That 3500 calories over seven days = 500 calories a day you have to eliminate by not eating them or exercising them off. · Find the calorie count for the foods you'll eat on the Internet. · Try eating 300 calories less each day. Smaller portions should take care of this. · A rule of thumb for exercise is a half-hour of cardio, like brisk walking or jogging = about 200 calories, depending on body weight and effort. · If you start now you'll be used to the routine by the time the goodies come around. It should be easier to eliminate those extra calories too. · Let's say you'll eat about an extra 2000 calories in stuffing, pie, cake and cookies etc. during the holidays. · Break that down over two weeks. 2000 over 14 days = 143 extra calories a day to get rid of in addition to your 500 a day. · So during the holidays you need to not eat or exercise off 643 calories a day. · Here's where stepping up the exercise to 45 minutes or an hour for those two weeks can buy you those extra calories and keep you on track to lose one lb a week. Once you've crunched the numbers, applying this formula is simple. You just need to eat and exercise smart. If you're the host and cook, it's easier to go light and offer delicious reduced calorie choices. But, dining with family and friends is another matter, especially when you love their cooking. The upside to holiday eating where you've eaten before, maybe for years, is that you have an idea what to expect and you have a chance to plan.Planning your meals and exercise in advance is a good idea. It simplifies your choices when you're confronted with lots of food. Whether you count calories, points, or eyeball your portions, eat half of what you think you should eat. If you are not sure of a particular food or treat, pass on it, or just take a bite to see if it is worth the calories. If you find yourself hungry after all of this, you can eat a little more or maybe you've actually saved room for that dessert.You'll know what's worth the calories and what not to be tempted with.This video shows you the method I use. Check it out. It may help you get organized.As for exercise, I try to err on the side of a little extra around the holidays. I start picking it up a couple of weeks early so I have some extra calories clicked off in advance and I don't have to knock myself out to hit some calorie count.Don't go crazy with this. Moderation is the key. If you find you're not up to the two-lb weight loss this year, use the formula to maintain and shoot for weight loss next year.If you manage to do this during the holidays, it can set the tone for your behavior going into the New Year, and that could prove very healthy indeed.Happy holidays to you and yours!Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Selective focus.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9f204d2100003300c635c6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"'Tis the season for overeating. The weeks leading up to Christmas and New Year's are filled with lots of social gatherings and food festivities. Food is everywhere, whether the office party, family events, buffets, cocktail parties or holiday candy gifts. It is also a stressful time for many people which, in and of itself, can lead to additional overeating.With some advance planning, and smart pointers, however, you can come out healthier and more rejuvenated, and maybe even a few pounds thinner in time for the New Year. To help you avoid gaining weight this season and reduce ""food-related"" stress, below I offer strategies that I've successfully used with clients in my talks and nutrition counseling practice. I invite you to try incorporating them into your daily routine.1. Plan your day.Part of the reason we overeat is that we do not pay much attention to what we are going to eat. We forget to eat, wait till we are famished and then overeat, or just grab whatever we can find when on the run. I suggest trying to map out your day in the morning and thinking about some of the healthy food choices you can make. For example, if you are going to a dinner party, plan for a healthy snack an hour or two before you go so that you are not starved when you arrive. If you are going out to lunch or dinner, view the menu in advance so you can get an idea of what you may want to order.2. Eat healthy most of the time. This is not a time to begin a diet. Or to ban your favorite foods. My suggestion for this holiday season is to pick a few foods that you absolutely love and legalize them, that is, allow yourself to include them, sans the guilt. The key is not eating them all at once. Plan for one treat a day and this way you will have something to look forward to. 3. Downsize your portions. What I love about practicing portion control is that you can still eat what you love, just less of it, which will help you trim calories. You also do not have to say no entirely. For example, if your family is going to your favorite steakhouse, instead of not joining them, allow yourself to sharing a steak and order an extra portion of vegetables. Instead of saying to yourself ""I need to cut out all alcohol,"" allow yourself to include an occasional glass of wine with dinner. I offer additional portion-control tips here and here.4. Swap and substitute.I am a big fan of swapping out unhealthy foods for healthier ones. As a nutritionist, instead of telling clients not to eat this or that, providing them with healthy options helps to empower them to make smarter choices. Healthy substitutions allow you to give something up while including something else so that you do not feel deprived. Swap out refined grains for whole grains instead of cutting out grains entirely. For example, choose quinoa over white rice, if possible. You can also incorporate smart substitutions at home. Try using Greek yogurt or applesauce to cut some of the butter in your favorite recipe. 5. Drink more water.Drinking water regularly will keep you hydrated. So often, we think we are hungry, but we really are just thirsty. I recommend including water, seltzer or herbal tea to keep you hydrated. Fruits and vegetables, along with vegetable-based soups also count toward fluid. Skip the soda and juice, and go easy on alcohol and caffeinated beverages. I suggest keeping a water bottle on your desk or in your brief case. It will serve as a great reminder to drink up!6. Spice up your favorite dish.I love recommending spices for several reasons. Spices offer up a multitude of health benefits, ranging from containing anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, to acting as antioxidants and warding off disease. Also, when you incorporate spices into your diet, you tend to use less sugar and salt, which is a good thing. Spices are simple to keep on hand and don't take up much space. Instead of adding sugar to your coffee, try using cinnamon; instead of sprinkling salt on your eggs, try turmeric. 7. Include a fruit or a vegetable at each meal.Many of us fail to eat enough produce. Fruits and veggies contain lots of fiber as well as vitamins A and C, folate, and potassium. They are also relatively low in calories. Make an effort to add fruits and vegetables to your meals and snacks. Add berries to your yogurt, choose a salad with lunch or order a veggie-based soup, munch on baby carrots as a snack, and include a colorful assortment of veggies at dinner. Engage your kids and make a smoothie as an evening snack. The fruit and veggie servings quickly add up.And here's an added benefit--when you eat plenty of fruits and veggies, you tend to eat less junk food. 8. Keep moving.Even though this is a busy time of year, trying to incorporate some kind of exercise will really help you to not only keep your eating--and weight--in check but also to help you stay centered. Go for a swim or a run in the morning to get you going or go to a yoga class to help you slow down and be more mindful. Weather permitting, it's great to exercise outdoors in nature. Call a friend and go for a walk in the park. 9. Practice gratitude.Being grateful for your life and all of the good things going your way is so important. While things can always be a bit better, it is so important to take time out and have a grateful heart.10. Enjoy the company of family and friends.Last but not least, instead of focusing on food, nurture your relationships. When getting together with family and friends, savor their company, and enjoy catching up with them. At a dinner party, take a portion of food, grab your loved one, and focus on filling each other in on what has been going on in your lives.We would love to hear your favorite holiday survival tips. Wishing you and your loved ones a happy--and healthy--holiday season!"

Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, visited the students and said he hoped that teaching coding to children would become standard in education throughout the United States. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bacefc01f0000df00227a0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The month before standardized tests begin each school year, Stephen Lazar, a National Board-certified history and English teacher at Harvest Collegiate High School in New York City, tells his students that he is going to ""turn into a bad teacher. ... No more research, no more discussion, no more dealing with complexity, no more developing as writers with voice and style."" Instead, they practice mindless repetition of facts so they can perform well on a standardized test that, in its perverse way, Stephen says, ""works."" But he knows it doesn't really work -- that is, if we want to equip our kids with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful in life, college and career. When Stephen testified before Congress earlier this year, he told lawmakers that top-down, test-based accountability, which ""values three hours of testing over a year of learning and development,"" should be replaced with more valid and useful measures of student achievement. Stephen is one of thousands of educators, union leaders, parents and students who have called for changes to policies that essentially reduced kids to test scores and teachers to algorithms. AFT members alone took more than 100,000 actions online, submitted 20,000 comments to Congress, and met with numerous congressional leaders and staff. After all these years of test-and-sanction policies, Congress listened and acted. In a rare display of finding common ground, Congress recently passed the Every Student Succeeds Act by overwhelming majorities. ESSA replaces the broadly discredited No Child Left Behind Act, a law whose test-punish-repeat approach has left students alternately stressed or bored, has frustrated parents and has de-professionalized and demoralized teachers. Under the newly passed ESSA, high-stakes testing and sanctions are no longer the be-all and end-all in education. States still will administer standardized tests, but they can now limit the consequences of these tests and the time students spend taking them, and eliminate unnecessary or poor-quality tests. States have an explicit obligation to help struggling schools succeed, not simply close them. And they are obliged to build an accountability system grounded in what students need to know and be able to do -- for example, by allowing project-based assessments, which can replace regular state standardized assessments in seven pilot states. ESSA focuses on populations of students who need the most, providing funds that can be used for early childhood programs, class-size reduction and community schools. It maintains high certification requirements for paraprofessionals, and it gets the federal government out of the business of teacher evaluation. Does this law solve all the problems of public education? No law can. Indeed, just this week researchers recognized (again) the impact of poverty, finding that poor kids start school a year behind wealthier kids. But this new law can create positive change. States will now take the lead on accountability, interventions and teacher evaluation systems. While some states will mess up, we hope most will learn from the failures of NCLB and give teachers and schools the latitude and support to deeply engage students and to focus on the whole child. There are other signs the tide is turning. Gov. Andrew Cuomo's Common Core Task Force, on which I served, last week urged a reboot of education policy in New York after its disastrous implementation of the Common Core. The task force calls for the development of new state standards, along with curriculum, tests and training, that focus on kids' unique needs and foster a joy of learning. And it recommends a moratorium on evaluating teachers using students' test scores. Now that the federal law has been overhauled, every state should do what this task force did--diagnose what's working and what's not, and make the necessary fixes.When state officials err, we will still have to fight, as in New Mexico, where educators and union leaders have long called for changes to the state's teacher evaluation system, which is based on a flawed ""value-added"" model. Earlier this month, a judge granted a preliminary injunction that halts the use of this system, calling it a ""Beta test where teachers bear the burden for its uneven and inconsistent application."" The people closest to our kids have shined a light on harmful education policies and practices. Responsibility now moves to the states, and officials must use this opportunity to get this reset right. I call on them to work with educators, parents, unions and other partners to help bring back the joy of teaching and learning, and to empower teachers to stoke students' curiosity and help them pursue their interests, work in teams, and wrestle with and master concepts. Because wonderful educators like Stephen Lazar should have the resources and latitude not simply to prepare kids to take tests, but to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them."
