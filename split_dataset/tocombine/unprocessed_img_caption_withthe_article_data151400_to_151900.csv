Delta Air Lines Inc. and Northwest Airlines Corp. shareholders backed a merger of the companies, leaving a federal antitrust review as the final hurdle to creating the world's largest carrier.

Rarer still are CEO's willing to give up their seat on said airline so a passenger can make it home on time.Delta CEO Richard Anderson is apparently no average CEO. As illustrated in a Facebook post by a happy customer Monday, Anderson relinquished his seat aboard a Delta flight last Thursday night so a tired mother could pick up her daughter from summer camp.After a travel day full of lengthy delays, cancellations, and mechanical failures due to the weather, passenger Jessie Frank writes that she was relieved to find that somehow, despite being 8th on the standby list, a spot had opened up for her.Frank hurried aboard the airplane and was helped to her seat by ""a vaguely familiar face"" who grabbed her bag and stored it in the plane's overhead bin. But as the plane began its descent, Frank had an epiphany:Suddenly I realized that “familiar face” was not an off-duty pilot. It was you, the CEO of Delta, vaguely familiar from the safety video. It was you, Richard Anderson, who gave up your seat for me. It was you, the Delta CEO, who helped me with my bag. It was you, acting just like an ordinary Mr. Anderson, who showed me to my seat.Needless to say, Frank is likely to fly Delta again in the future. In an email to The Huffington Post, Delta confirmed the note was, indeed, ""fantastic"" and true."

A fan tweeted back suggesting that she could instead try another marriage, to which Frankel replied:Frankel seperated from husband Jason Hoppy in December 2012, and  filed for divorce the following month. The couple has one daughter together, Bryn, of whom they have both requested primary custody. Their divorce has been anything but ordinary though; People magazine reports that, as of May 2013, Frankel and Hoppy both still reside in the Manhattan apartment they bought while married.""My living situation is very, very stressful,"" Frankel told the magazine in May 2013.

A stroll through the local market is one of our favorite family outings. Each week, as part of our 52 New Foods adventure, we head out to find something new to try. Juicy red strawberries this week, bright green okra the next -- what the kids pick is always a surprise (to me and to them).The farmers market is a fantastic way to make healthy food fun. The riot of color, the bustle of people, and the gentle strumming of the guitar come together to create the feeling of a celebration. It's also an easy way to shift the focus from processed foods to fresh, whole foods. After the pizza-laden end of school year parties, it's time for a reset! But more than the food, the farmers market is about community. Our focus at the market is about getting to know our local food friends -- the farmers who grow our food, the neighbors who shop there, and the new foods that the changing seasons bring. We talk with the farmers about what's growing in their fields, ask for advice on how to decipher whether our pick of the week is ripe (or not), and inquire about tips for how to prepare their bounty. This simple exchange begins to build a connection - the beginnings of a relationship -- that runs much deeper than the food we are buying. So for the next few weeks, I'll be writing about what we've discovered through our community at the local market. First up... finding the perfect plumcot.Why do you shop at the farmers market?

Not particularly known for his physique before, this Scottish-born actor put on such a tremendous coat of muscles for his role as King Leonidas in the film 300 that Butler's workout regimen, devised by trainer Mark Twight, has become a phenomenon. (Google ""300 workout"" for an endless list of instructional videos, variations and how-tos.)But however much you sweat and grimace on your way to emulating Butler's bulging abs, you're at a distinct disadvantage: getting into shape for a role is part of an actor's job, and he or she can dedicate hours a day to work with the world's top trainers.Celebrity fitness gurus like Harley Pasternak and Simon Waterson have their patented methods for transforming their charges' bodies depending on the demands of a role. An ex-British Royal Marine, Waterson has trained the last two James Bonds, Halle Berry, Chris Evans and Jake Gyllenhaal, and, in his opinion, being an actor is akin to being a sports pro.""It is tough having to do these things, especially with actors who are being asked to be athletes,"" he told BodyBuilding.com. ""Professional athletes get to have 12 hours sleep, they get to nap, they get the right food. They've got that structure, as well as not having to go to actual work and do like a 14-hour day and then train, like an actor has to.""In addition to doing grueling regimens of weight training and cardio--not to mention going on sometimes freakish diets--actors have to learn physically demanding skills like sword handling and horseback riding for specific parts. Jennifer Lawrence put in hours upon hours working on her archery skills to make her performance in The Hunger Games believable.And all that conditioning isn't for show, either. Trainers often go to boxing, martial arts and the old French military art of parkour to keep actors nimble and athletic so they can climb, jump and do whatever else their action-packed roles demand.- Mark Lebetkin, The Active TimesMore from The Daily Meal: 6 Worthless Exercises You Likely Do Amazing Fitness Records 24 Best Boardwalks for Food Rad Fitness Fads"
