0,DIVORCE,What Is 'Conscious Uncoupling'? Experts Unpack Gwyneth Paltrow's Split Announcement,Anna Almendrala,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conscious-uncoupling_us_5b9df298e4b03a1dcc8f4e0b,"""Children don't necessarily see their parents as two individual entities attached by the institution of marriage,"" said Neuman",2014-03-26,"Gwyneth Paltrow arrives at the premiere of ""Thanks for Sharing"" at the ArcLight Hollywood on Monday, Sept. 16, 2013 in Los Angeles. (Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df2983c00005b000a583d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even when it comes to divorce, Gwyneth Paltrow is an aspirational lifestyle brand. When the actress announced her separation from husband and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin on Tuesday, she described it as a ""conscious uncoupling."" The phrase conjures up that en vogue mindfulness trend of the moment and frames divorce as simply a matter of gentle unlinking, as opposed to a hostile break. The announcement, posted on Paltrow's lifestyle site Goop.com, ran alongside an essay about ""conscious uncoupling"" written by Drs. Habib Sadeghi and Sherry Sami, who specialize in integrating Eastern and Western medicine. Sadeghi and Sami argue that expectations for a lifelong marriage need to evolve along with humans' expanded life expectancy, and that a successful marriage could be redefined not by how long it lasts, but how meaningful and fulfilling the relationship is for both partners. Divorce and legal experts say that the phrase ""conscious uncoupling"" could also signal a non-combative, collaborative way to think about the divorce process, especially as it relates to children. To psychotherapist M. Gary Neuman, a Florida-based marriage expert and creator of the Neuman Method, ""conscious uncoupling"" acknowledges that the couple is the center of the family and is often seen as single unit to the children. Uncoupling from your partner is essentially de-centering the family -- an act that will have a profound, lifelong effect on children, no matter how it's done, Neuman said.""Children don't necessarily see their parents as two individual entities attached by the institution of marriage,"" said Neuman in an interview with the Huffington Post. ""They come to see their parents as one parental unit -- mom and dad as one collective team.""Paltrow and Martin have two young children together, whom the couple committed to ""coparent"" in their separation announcement. Neuman isn't affiliated with Paltrow's family and does not know about the details of their relationship, but he praised the couple for what seemed to be an early effort to consider their children's feelings above all else. ""You can't do better for your child than staying happily married,"" Neuman said. ""Nonetheless, when people 'consciously uncouple,' it means we're going to have a clear awareness about how this is going to affect the children going forward."" From a legal standpoint, ""conscious uncoupling"" could also signal Paltrow and Martin's desire to engage in a collaborative, not combative, divorce, said Toronto-based family lawyer Nathalie Boutet, who does not know the couple but commented on their case to HuffPost. ""Collaborative law is not new at all,"" Boutet said. ""It's a very evolved, mature way of resolving disputes."" More and more people are opting for amicable, collaborative divorces because they want to avoid unnecessary conflict and the kind of legal combat that only prolongs and makes public the negotiations, explained Boutet. Indeed, privacy was an expressly stated wish in the celebrity pair's separation announcement.But ""conscious uncoupling"" could go beyond the legal process, said Boutet. For Paltrow and Martin, it could mean a commitment to refrain from trashing each other in the newspapers or social media. Above all, it's about respect for each other's well-beings, careers and reputations. ""[Conscious uncoupling] is simply thinking about the consequences of your actions,"" concluded Boutet. ""It's making plans rather than reacting to emotions like fear, anger or revenge."" Only time will tell how Paltrow and Martin's decision to ""consciously uncouple"" will pan out. But if they're successful, those details won't make it to the online pages of the Huffington Post. "

When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy.' They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life."" -- John LennonYour television may tell you that spending more money and taking lavish vacations are the pathways to happiness, but finding extraordinary pleasure in the ordinary moments, even the mundane, is your true route to happiness.If you doubt that pleasure is easy to find without spending money, first realizing that it's your natural state, is a step in the right direction.Ever spend some time watching children? They are pleasure-seeking, in the moment, happiness machines. So what happens to the rest of us 30 years later? Somewhere between our younger years and adulthood, we get lost in responsibility and actually forgo pleasure as an important component of living. We buy into the belief that pleasure is to be saved for after 5 p.m., on weekends, and once a year on a two-week vacation.To be authentically healthy, we need to find the balance between juggling adult responsibilities, and enjoying simple happy pleasures.Balance consists of doing all those adult things we're supposed to be doing, yet having some fun in the process. We must remember happiness and joy are a choice. Dishes? Laundry? Commute to work? With a little creativity, all of it can be pleasurable.For me, I'm more than happy to stick dirty clothes in the washer, toss them in the dryer and witness their clean, soft transformation, and then let them sit in the laundry basket for two weeks -- until they wrinkle beyond recognition. I hate to fold laundry. I loath it. So I sneak a little fun in. I put on a motivational CD, light some incense, dump the basket on my bedroom floor before bedtime, and sit there folding and putting everything in its rightly place as I absorb some interesting information I'd never take the time to listen to during my day.   The joy I end up feeling as I go to bed with every piece of laundry in its proper place always surprises me. The task I hate most actually makes me happy when I do it in this ritualistic way.Sound silly? What other choice do we have? Adult responsibilities aren't going away, so why not inject them with some free fun while we're at it? Creating ritual in the mundane allows us to find more joy in life.Lighting a candle while making dinner so a warm glow shines on the chopping board makes preparing meals beautiful. Waking up to a favorite song programed into an alarm, or smelling coffee brewing in an automatic coffee maker, can make even cold winter mornings palatable. Get my point? We have to make pleasure happen in the seemingly mundane routine of adult life.Pleasure is a muscle that once formed and exercised, becomes habit. When we become a pleasure seeking person creating joy in the ordinary -- our life becomes extraordinary.Originally posted via Daily TransformationsPhoto via seductivewomanblogspot.com"

Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts seemed to be the two main contenders, but America's favorite was unclear. We've polled our readers on the subject. And we've done deathmatches to get to the bottom of it. But nothing felt conclusive. To our pleasant surprise, we finally have the answer to our question and it comes in the form of a beautifully dotted map (see below). According to this map by Flowing Data, we've learned that we have been asking the wrong question when it comes to America's favorite coffee chain. It isn't about which coffee chain is better -- Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts -- but where it's better. Not too surprisingly, Dunkin' Donuts is New England's coffee chain of choice -- Bostonians' love for Dunkies will never, ever falter. And on the West Coast, Starbucks is top dog. (Naturally. It just trickled its way down from Seattle, where it originated.) But what we didn't anticipate was that in some parts of the country neither one of those all-popular chains ranked at all. Caribou coffee rules the Midwest. And then, there's Tim Horton's -- which as it turns out is not just Canada's coffee choice.

Asia risks having 12 million new HIV infections over the next five years but could cut that number in half if it acts fast enough to deter the spread of the virus among drug users, sex workers and men who have sex with men, a UNAIDS report said Friday. (AP Photo/Koji Sasahara)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df1a92200005700d9d2d0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kate Kelland, Health and Science CorrespondentLONDON (Reuters) - Peter Piot was 27, newly qualified and working in a microbiology lab in Antwerp when he received a flask of human blood contaminated with a mysterious pathogen that had been killing people in the forests of Zaire.If he'd known then what he was to discover - that inside was Ebola, one of the most lethal infectious diseases now known in humans - he would have taken more safety precautions.As it was, Piot and his colleagues wore only latex gloves and white cotton lab coats as they unscrewed the top, took out its contents - vials of infected blood taken from a Flemish nun in Zaire, stored in a blue thermos flask and couriered to Belgium on a passenger plane - and began analysing them.""Looking back, that was probably quite irresponsible. But we didn't know then what we were dealing with,"" the now 65-year-old said in an interview from his office at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where he is director.""These are dangerous moments - particularly when you don't know what you've got. Such blood can contain very high levels of virus.""""SPECTACULAR VIRUS""That tale dates from Belgium in 1976, when Piot and his team became the co-discoverers of Ebola. The young Belgian scientist then went to Zaire, now Congo, in central Africa to work in the rainforests among dying villagers and missionaries to collect samples and investigate the epidemic.Yet almost four decades on, the disease Piot describes as ""a spectacular virus - and one of the most lethal infections you can think of"", has continued to rise up in the region, causing frightening but sporadic outbreaks that kill poor and vulnerable people with gruesome haemorrhagic fevers.In Guinea, health authorities said on Monday that an outbreak there - the first known in a west Africa country - already involves scores of suspected cases.The Geneva-based World Health Organisation said on Tuesday Guinea had reported at least 86 cases reported, including 59 deaths.Six suspected Ebola cases, including five deaths, in neighbouring Liberia were also under investigation, it said.Piot says he's saddened and frustrated by this and other outbreaks - partly because they should be easy to prevent, or at least to contain, and partly because the scientific detective work behind the Ebola virus has not yet revealed its main host.""What we're seeing is a pattern that's been repeated in nearly every single Ebola outbreak,"" he told Reuters.""It started in people who live in the forest, or in close contact with it, and it's then transmitted around hospitals....and then spreads further either at funerals or in households though close contact.""NO TREATMENT OR VACCINEThe virus initially causes a raging fever, headaches, muscle pain and conjunctivitis, before moving to severe phases that bring on vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding. It kills up to 90 percent of those who become infected.That there is no treatment or vaccine against Ebola suggests people are helpless in the face of this vicious virus, but Piot insists that is not the case.""Fundamentally, Ebola is easy to contain,"" he said. ""It's not a question of needing high technology.""""It's about respecting the basics of hygiene, and about isolation, quarantine and protecting yourself - in particular protecting healthcare workers, because they are very exposed.""The problem in Guinea, and in other countries in Africa where Ebola has reared up in the past few decades, is that health systems are in bad shape, he said, communications are limited, and the people are fairly mobile and very poor.As a doctor and researcher whose life has been dedicated to the pursuit of deadly viruses - (after his Ebola discovery Piot became one of the world's leading scientific experts on HIV and AIDS) - Piot is also frustrated that scientists have not yet been able to pin down the main host of this lethal fever.While the virus is known to be transmitted to people from wild animals, before spreading in humans through person-to-person transmission, its main animal host - or what virologists often call the ""reservoir"" of a virus - is not totally clear.Piot, like others, suspects fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are the most likely natural host, yet the uncertainty leaves scientists unable to get ahead of fresh outbreaks.""This is a virus that is highly unpredictable,"" he said. ""This time it popped up in Guinea where it has never been detected before.""Why there? Why now? That's what I find frustrating. If we knew for sure the host of this virus, we could do more to say where people are more at risk.""(Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)"
