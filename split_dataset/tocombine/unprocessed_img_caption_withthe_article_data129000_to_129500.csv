Stephens Elementary School in Greenfield, Ind., Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2007. A new study found that kindergartners and first-graders' body mass indexes grow at a faster rate during summer vacation than during the school year. The findings suggest that children gain more fat mass during the summer, but that kids' busy school days help them stay fit.

Meanwhile, illegal drug use remained the third highest perceived threat, but shrank from 49 to 43 percent.“These findings are a clear indication that there is a longstanding groundswell of concern among California voters about the related epidemics of diabetes and obesity,” Dr. George Flores of The California Endowment stated in the press release. A majority surveyed support initiatives encouraging healthy diet and exercise. “Voters strongly support interventions that will reduce risks for these conditions, such as access to free clean drinking water and community health workers to help people live healthier lives in healthier places,” Flores said. That childhood obesity is a priority concern for California voters is good news for health advocates and lawmakers pushing policies like the statewide soda tax. Researchers suggest the move would save hundreds of millions of dollars in medical costs and reduce new diabetes cases by tens of thousands.""Looking at these results, wow, the public is really starting to absorb a lot of the things we've been telling them for a long time,"" Dr. Carolyn Jasik of UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital told the San Francisco Chronicle. ""Not only are they hearing that obesity is a problem, but they're hearing how to make it better. They're getting it from the media, the government, their doctors, their schools. It's on everybody's mind now.""Given government findings that a whopping 18 percent of American children ages 6 to 19 are obese, it’s no surprise voters are catching on to the troubling phenomenon -- and that may mean embracing government policies aimed at improving and restricting American children’s diet.

We work with a team psychologist",2014-02-12,"WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA - APRIL 27: Ice hockey player Julie Chu poses for a portrait during the USOC Portrait Shoot on April 27, 2013 in West Hollywood, California. (Photo by Harry How/Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dc714240000310053b8af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Welcome to our ""Like An Olympian"" series. During the 2014 Sochi Olympics, HuffPost Healthy Living will take a look at lifestyle and fitness lessons from competitors, coaches and former Olympians alike. We recently had the opportunity to speak with USA Hockey forward Julie Chu, who has partnered with Proctor and Gamble's Thank You, Mom campaign leading up to her fourth Olympic Games.It sounds like your family has been really important in getting you where you are today. Tell me about this family motto of yours? Back in 2005, for my parents' 30th anniversary, my dad came up with the acronym for Chu, commitment, honor and unity. These are the values our family as always had, but it was a way, on this special occasion, to make it more concrete. They are things we really believe in. I'm fortunate to have such an amazing family and so thankful for them. It hasn't just been my Olympic journey, it's been our Olympic journey.How does the lead-up to this Games feel compared to your other three? This one is the hardest so far. I say that because every Olympic cycle we're pushing the envelope to be better. Our coaches are expecting a lot of us at every practice and every game and continue to push us. We went through a lot of growing pains to be where we needed to be in terms of team tactics and fundamental skills. We grew tremendously as a team.What does your training regimen look like? Earlier on in the season we were lifting off-ice three days a week. Off-ice strength-training is so important. We're committed to that aspect. And then we were skating five or six days a week. That may be five practices or a combination of practices and a game or two.In addition to being in great shape, what kind of role do diet and nutrition play? Nutrition is huge for us. We work with a nutritionist who is part of the U.S. Olympic Committee. She does amazing things for us, like teaching us how we can better fuel our bodies immediately before and after a workout. What we do in those time frames really makes a difference in both quick recovery or to keep our energy up. Of course, it's also about balance and moderation: I like a burger and fries like everyone else. But having a balance diet helps us perform our best.It's got to be kind of a commitment. It's easy to say, ""I want to be healthy."" But to actually go through the process: Keeping great options in your fridge or planning enough in advance to bring snacks or pack lunch. You have to put yourself in the best environment or make changes.Do you have a go-to pre-game meal? When we're on the road, we'll have a team meal given to us, but it's similar to what I might eat at home as well: some lean protein, some kind of carb like a potato or pasta, fresh vegetables. I like a peanut butter and jelly if I can, so I'm not hungry when I actually get on the ice.How does sleep impact your performance? We talk about the fact that we want to step on the ice and perform to the best of our ability, meaning have great energy, our minds are focused. We know we can only do that if we've trained well, gotten the proper nutrition and gotten the proper amount of rest, and that includes sleep. We have a coach who tracks our sleep. We can check in and say, ""This week I was only getting six to seven hours, but my body typically seems to function better at eight or nine hours."" We make sure when we're traveling to step away from the stimulation of phones and computers and relax.What are your goals for Sochi? Our team goal is to win the gold medal. For the last four years we've been training extremely hard to hopefully execute come Sochi. That's our dream. And also representing Team USA to the best of our abilities, to be great representatives of a country that we love and a sport that we love.That sounds like it could be, oh, just a little stressful! How do you keep the pressure at bay? We work with a team psychologist, we like to call her a mental skills coach. She teaches us different techniques that help us in different situations, whether it's quieting our mind and getting focused or visualization. Visualization is a huge tactic that we use that has great benefits to the actual on-ice execution.Check out Chu's ""Thank You, Mom"" video below:As told to Sarah Klein.

The island is a world completely its own, far from the typical African safari. Having worked, lived, and studied primates in Madagascar, Travis has an in-depth knowledge of not only the wildlife, but also the country's culture and traditions. Led by Travis, a journey into this exotic land unveils all the bizarrely beautiful creatures lurking in its landscapes. Known as the ""Eighth Continent,"" the ""Red Island,"" and ""Land of the Lemurs,"" Madagascar is one of the most unusual and amazing destinations to explore. Nearly everything found in Madagascar can only found there and nowhere else in the world. Per square kilometer, there is more genetic diversity than anywhere else on the planet. On top of that, Madagascar is huge! It is the fourth largest island in the world and is comparable in size to France or Texas. With that kind of size, the possibilities are endless, and incredible wildlife is waiting round every corner. From invisible geckos and colorful chameleons to strange primates and otherworldly insects, here are a few amazing creatures that you may see while visiting what is arguably the most unique country in the world. Indri Lemurs were named after roman ""spirits of the dead"" because of their haunting calls. The indri is arguably the most spectacular lemur. With a call that sounds like a piping trumpet, Indris are the loudest of all lemurs and the second loudest primate in the world. Although their habitat is decreasing, Indris are one of the easiest lemurs to observe in the wild. A visit to Madagascar isn't complete until you have heard one of these amazing animals.Giraffe Necked Weevil Long necks and spectacular red and black bodies make this unusual insect quite a sight to see. They are found on only one plant species in the eastern wet forests of Madagascar. With their impossibly long necks, males battle other males for access to females. Females, in turn, select the strongest male, as evidenced by its long neck. Here is a situation where size does matter.Leaf Flatid Bug Starting life under a leaf looking like miniature popcorn, leaf flatid bugs later grow into outrageous Martian-like bugs that clump together on a tree. The clumps look like strange flowers or fungus. However, after living virtually in the same spot for weeks, the insects molt into their adult form, a beautiful leaf bug. Their bright colors can be green, yellow, or red and they are another oddity who call the island home.Leaf-Tailed Gecko Some animals astonish with their bright colors, strange sounds, or unusual shape. Leaf-tailed geckos, on the other hand, are incredible because of their insane ability not to be seen. They are one of the most cryptic animals in the world. Some species have developed textured bodies that help them blend seamlessly onto the bark of a tree. Other species contort their bodies and form shapes reminiscent of dead leaves. Leaf-tailed geckos are masters of camouflage. To see one requires a keen eye and knowledge of their habits. Fortunately, Madagascar has some amazing guides that know just where to look.Chameleons Strictly speaking you can find chameleons in many countries throughout the world, but Madagascar has over half of the world's species in one place! Although masters of camouflage chameleons come in a variety of colors, sizes, and shapes. The world's largest and smallest can be found in Madagascar. The smallest -- the micro chameleon -- is actually the smallest lizard in the world. About Travis A primatologist with a passion for conservation, Travis Steffens has dedicated his life and research to community development efforts, environmental education, eco-tourism projects, and international awareness in Madagascar. Considered an expert in the field, his current research is on the impact of habitat loss and threat of extinction posed to lemurs, a primate with 100 different species (many of which are endangered) endemic to the isolated African country. Travis holds a BSc and MA in Primatology, is currently a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto, the founder of Planet Madagascar, and is a current Kensington Tours Explorer in Residence.Photos courtesy of Kensington Tours "
