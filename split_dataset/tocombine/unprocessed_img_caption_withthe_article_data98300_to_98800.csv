A tiny snippet of field recordings from the march can be heard at the very end of the movie's credits, but otherwise the movie ignores the constant singing that emboldened the marchers during the four-day, 54- mile trek. Not surprisingly, Pete Seeger -- who died a year ago at age 94 -- was there to help lift the marchers' spirits, as he did for every progressive crusade during his lifetime.Rev. Martin Luther King invited Seeger to join the March 1965 event that helped draw national attention to the horrors of Jim Crow segregation and the denial of voting rights and which led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act later that year. Other singers -- including Odetta, Nina Simone, Joan Baez, Harry Belafonte, Leon Bibb, Ella Fitzgerald, and Peter, Paul and Mary -- joined the march, too. But the marchers didn't need celebrities to get them to sing. Throughout the civil rights movement, activists used songs -- at church meetings, rallies, and protests, on buses during Freedom Rides, and even in jail -- to boost their morale. They often revised Negro spirituals to fit specific occasions. Seeger was not at march to entertain, but to help empower the protesters through their collective voice and to show his solidarity with the civil rights struggle, as he'd done for years. During the march, amid the tension and heat, Pete joined with others in song. When they stopped at night, pitching tents along the roadside, Seeger went from campfire to campfire, listening to the exhausted marchers sing, encouraging them, and jotting down the words so he could spread their message. With Len Chandler and the Freedom Voices, Seeger compiled a collection of songs that were sung during the march or were inspired by that fateful protest, including ""Do What the Spirits Say Do,"" ""Oh, Wallace,"" ""Which Side Are You On?"" ""Aint Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me 'Round,"" and ""Keep Your Eyes on the Prize."" Folkways Records released the album, WNEW's Story of Selma, a few months later. It is still available.Seeger played an important but little-known role in the civil rights movement. He and folksinger Guy Carawan had heard the song ""We Shall Overcome"" at the Highlander Folk School, a training center for civil rights and labor activists in Tennessee. They rewrote the words and music to make it more singable. They introduced it to activists at civil rights rallies and meetings, and it soon became the movement's anthem. But it didn't stop there. Human rights activists around the world adopted ""We Shall Overcome"" as their own theme song. In that way, and in many other ways, Seeger brought the world closer together with his music. Every day, every minute, someone in the world is singing a Pete Seeger song. For over six decades, he introduced Americans to songs from other cultures, like ""Wimowe"" (""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"") from Africa, ""Tzena, Tzena"" from Israel (which reached #2 on the pop charts), and ""Guantanemera"" from Cuba, inspiring what is now called ""world music."" The songs he wrote, including the antiwar tunes, ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone?"", ""If I Had a Hammer,"" and ""Turn, Turn, Turn,"" and those he popularized, including ""This Land Is Your Land"" and ""We Shall Overcome,"" have been recorded by hundreds of artists in many languages and have become global anthems for people fighting for freedom. His songs are sung by people in cities and villages around the world, promoting the basic idea that the hopes that unite us are greater than the fears that divide us. Seeger was a much-acclaimed and innovative guitarist and banjoist, a globe-trotting minstrel and song collector, and the author of many songbooks and musical how-to manuals. In addition to being a World War 2 veteran, he was on the front lines of every key progressive crusade during his lifetime -- labor unions and migrant workers in the 1930s and 1940s, the banning of nuclear weapons and opposition to the Cold War in the 1950s, civil rights and the anti-Vietnam War movement in the 1960s, environmental responsibility and opposition to South African apartheid in the 1970s, and, always, human rights throughout the world.Pete kept coming out of semi-retirement to do one more concert, give one more interview, write one more book, record one more album. His remarkable spirit, energy, and optimism kept him going through triumphs and tragedies, but he outlived all his enemies and remained one of the greatest American heroes of this or any other era.Pete was the subject of several biographies (including David King Dunaway's How Can I Keep from Singing? The Ballad of Pete Seeger, Alec Wilkinson's The Protest Singer: An Intimate Portrait of Pete Seeger and Alan Winkler's To Everything There Is a Season ) as well as Jim Brown's inspiring documentary film, Pete Seeger: The Power of Song. Last year, Ronald Cohen and James Capaldi edited a wonderful collection of articles, The Pete Seeger Reader, that trace his long and storied career, focusing on his work as not only a singer, but also on his substantial contributions as an educator, songwriter, organizer, publisher, and journalist. But Pete, who was modest and self-effacing, never wrote a full-length autobiography. Three years ago, however, he published a collection of his own writings, Pete Seeger In His Own Words. The book presents Pete in his own voice. With Pete's cooperation, Rob Rosenthal (a sociology professor at Wesleyan University) and Sam Rosenthal (a musician and writer) dug through Pete's extensive writings -- letters stored for decades in his family barn, notes to himself, published articles, rough drafts, stories, books, poems, and songs -- to chronicle and illuminate Pete's incredible life as America's troubadour for social justice. The son of musicologists Charles and Ruth Seeger, Pete spent two years at Harvard, where he got involved in radical politics and helped start a student newspaper, the Harvard Progressive, but he quit in 1938 in order to try his own hand at changing society by making music. He worked at the Library of Congress's Archive of American Folk Song (where he learned many of the songs he would sing throughout his career), traveled around with Woody Guthrie singing at migrant labor camps and union halls, and perfected his guitar- and banjo-playing skills.In 1941, at age 22, Seeger formed the Almanac Singers with Lee Hays and Millard Lampell, later joined by Guthrie, Bess Lomax (daughter of musicologist John Lomax), and several others who rotated in and out of the group. The Almanacs drew on traditional songs and wrote their own songs to advance the cause of progressive groups, the Communist Party, the Congress of Industrial Organizations unions, the New Deal, and, later, the United States and its allies (including the Soviet Union) in the fight against fascism. The Almanacs were part of a broader upsurge of popular progressive culture during the New Deal, fostered in part by programs like the federal theater and writers' projects. Even so, the group was hounded by the FBI, got few bookings, and was dropped by its agent, the William Morris Agency. After Seeger and Guthrie joined the military, the group disbanded in 1943.The Almanacs cultivated an image of being unpolished amateurs. Guthrie once said that the Almanacs ""rehearsed on stage."" Among them, however, Seeger was the most gifted and disciplined musician, with a remarkable repertoire of traditional songs. He carefully crafted a stage persona that inspired audiences to join him, a performing style that he perfected when he began working as a soloist. Every Seeger concert involved a lot of group singing.Immediately after World War II, American radicals and liberals sought to resume popular support for progressive unions, civil rights, and internationalism. The left's folk-music wing hoped to build on its modest successes before and during the war. In 1946 Seeger led the effort to create People's Songs (an organization of progressive songwriters and performers, dominated by but not confined to folk musicians) and People's Artists (a booking agency to help the members of People's Songs get concert gigs and recording contracts). They compiled The People's Song Book (which included protest songs from around the world), sponsored a number of successful concerts, and organized chapters in several cities and on college campuses.When Henry Wallace ran for president on the Progressive Party ticket in 1948, his campaign relied heavily on folk music. Seeger traveled with Wallace during the campaign, distributing song sheets at every meeting or rally so that sing-alongs, led by Seeger, could alternate with Wallace's speeches.By 1949 folk music had become increasingly popular, with performers like Burl Ives, Josh White, and others gaining a foothold in popular culture, but the folk music of this period had lost much of its political edge.For a brief period, as a member of the Weavers folk quartet, Seeger achieved commercial success, performing several chart-topping songs that reflected his eclectic repertoire. The group was formed in 1948 by Seeger and Hays (both former Almanacs), along with Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman. They exposed audiences to their repertoire of songs from around the world as well as to American folk traditions, but without the overt advocacy of left-wing political causes. Decca Records signed the Weavers to a recording contract and added orchestral arrangements and instruments to their music, a commercial expediency that rankled Seeger but delighted Hays. The Weavers performed in the nation's most prestigious nightclubs and appeared on network television shows.In 1950 their recording of an Israeli song, ""Tzena Tzena,"" reached number two on the pop charts, and their version of Lead Belly's ""Goodnight, Irene,"" reached number one and stayed on the charts for half a year. Several of their recordings -- ""On Top of Old Smokey,"" ""Kisses Sweeter Than Wine,"" the African song ""Wimoweh,"" and ""Midnight Special"" -- also made the charts. Their 1951 recording of Guthrie's song ""So Long It's Been Good to Know You,"" reached number four.But the Weavers' commercial success was short-lived. As soon as they began to be widely noticed in 1950, they were targeted by both private and government witch-hunters. The FBI and Congress escalated their investigations. Seeger and the Weavers were mentioned in Red Channels and Counterattack, the semiofficial private guidebooks for the blacklist. A few performers, notably Josh White and Burl Ives, agreed to cooperate with the investigators and were able to resume their careers; others refused to do so, and some were blacklisted. The Weavers survived for another year with bookings and even TV shows, but finally the escalating Red Scare caught up with them. Their contract for a summer television show was canceled. They could no longer get bookings in the top nightclubs. Radio stations stopped playing their songs, and their records stopped selling. They never had another major hit record.Seeger left the Weavers to pursue a solo career, but he was blacklisted from the early 1950s through the mid-1960s. In 1955 he was convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to discuss his political affiliations at a hearing called by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, although he never spent time in jail. (The conviction was overturned on appeal in May 1962). Many colleges and concert halls refused to book Seeger. He was kept off network television. In 1963 ABC refused to allow Seeger to appear on Hootenanny, which owed its existence to the folk music revival Seeger had helped inspire. During the blacklist years, Seeger scratched out a living by giving guitar and banjo lessons and singing at the small number of summer camps, churches, high schools and colleges, and union halls that were courageous enough to invite the controversial balladeer. In 1966, on New York City's nonprofit educational television station, he hosted a low-budget folk music program, Rainbow Quest, that gave exposure to many little-known country, bluegrass, and folk singers. The station had a limited viewership at the time, but fortunately the programs were taped and are now available on YouTube.Eventually, however, Seeger's audience grew. In the 1960s he sang with civil rights workers at rallies and churches throughout the South. Alabama. In a letter to Seeger, Martin Luther King thanked him for his ""moral support and Christian generosity."" In 1967 Tom and Dick Smothers defiantly invited Seeger onto their popular CBS television variety show, the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. True to his principles, Seeger insisted on singing a controversial antiwar song, ""Waist Deep in the Big Muddy."" CBS censors refused to air the song, but public outrage forced the network to relent and allow him to perform the song on the show a few months later.Seeger helped catalyze the folk music revival of the 1960s, encouraging young performers, helping start the Newport Folk Festival, and promoting the folk song magazine Sing Out! that he had helped launch. His book How to Play the 5-String Banjo taught thousands of baby boomers how to play this largely forgotten instrument. On stage, he always taught his audiences songs from around the world, often sung in their original languages, such as ""Wimoweh"" and ""Guantanamera.""Many prominent musicians, including Bob Dylan, Bono, Joan Baez, the Byrds, Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks, Bonnie Raitt, Tom Morello, and Bruce Springsteen consider Seeger a role model and trace their musical roots to his influence. Many of his 80 albums -- which include children's songs, labor and protest songs, traditional American folk songs, international songs, and Christmas songs -- have reached wide audiences. His travels around the world -- collecting songs and performing in many languages -- inspired today's world music movement. Among performers around the globe, Seeger became a symbol of a principled artist deeply engaged in the world.In 1969 Seeger launched the group Clearwater (near his home in Beacon, N.Y.) and an annual celebration dedicated to cleaning up the polluted Hudson River. The effort, at first written off as simplistic and naive, helped inspire the environmental movement. The Hudson, once filled with oil pollution, sewage and toxic chemicals, is now swimmable.Through persistence and unrelenting optimism, Seeger endured and overcame the controversies triggered by his activism. In 1994, at age 75, he received the National Medal of Arts (the highest award given to artists and arts patrons by the U.S. government) as well as a Kennedy Center Honor, when President Bill Clinton called him ""an inconvenient artist, who dared to sing things as he saw them."" In 1996 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame because of his influence on so many rock performers. In 1997 he won the Grammy Award for his 18-track compilation album, Pete.In the 21st century, some of the nation's most prominent singers recorded albums honoring Seeger, including Springsteen's Seeger Sessions. In May 2009 more than 15,000 admirers filled New York City's Madison Square Garden for a concert honoring Seeger on his 90th birthday. The performers included Springsteen, Baez, Dave Matthews, Emmylou Harris, Billy Bragg, Rufus Wainwright, Bela Fleck, Taj Mahal, Roger McGuinn, Steve Earle, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Dar Williams, Tom Morello, Ani DiFranco, and John Mellencamp.In 2012 Pete released two new albums. A More Perfect Union featured 16 original songs written with singer-songwriter Lorre Wyatt and includes duets with Springsteen, Morello, Earle, Harris, and Williams. The two-CD Pete Remembers Woody honored his friend as part of the centennial celebration of Guthrie's birth. It includes reminiscences, songs, and anecdotes. In the year before he died, Seeger released the music video and single of ""God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You,"" performed with Arlo Guthrie at Carnegie Hall, shared the stage at New York's Beacon Theater with Harry Belafonte, Jackson Brown and others to celebrate the life of Native American activist Leonard Peltier, and issued an audiobook entitled Peter Seeger: The Storm King, Stories, Narratives and Poems (which was nominated for a Grammy). Toshi, his wife of 70 years who helped manage Pete's career, died in July 2014, just six months before him. Despite the enormous loss, Pete kept on singing. He sang ""I Come and Stand at Every Door"" on Democracy Now to commemorate the 68th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. He sang ""This Land is Your Land"" (adding an anti-fracking verse) at the Farm Aid concert in Saratoga Springs (joined by Willie Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp, and Dave Matthews). A month before he died he performed at a concert in Nyack to benefit the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a peace group. Probably no song reflects Pete's indomitable spirit more than ""Quite Early Morning,"" the song he sang on the Colbert Report in 2012. Don't you know it's darkest before the dawn And it's this thought keeps me moving on If we could heed these early warnings The time is now quite early morning If we could heed these early warnings The time is now quite early morningPete's fingers can strum no longer, but, thanks to him, people around the world can have many ""singing tomorrows.""Peter Dreier teaches politics and chairs the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College. His latest book is The 100 Greatest American of the 20th Century: A Social Justice Hall of Fame (Nation Books, 2012). Pete Seeger is one of the people profiled in the book.  "

A More Perfect Union featured 16 original songs written with singer-songwriter Lorre Wyatt and includes duets with Springsteen, Morello, Earle, Harris, and Williams. The two-CD Pete Remembers Woody honored his friend as part of the centennial celebration of Guthrie's birth. It includes reminiscences, songs, and anecdotes. In the year before he died, Seeger released the music video and single of ""God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You,"" performed with Arlo Guthrie at Carnegie Hall, shared the stage at New York's Beacon Theater with Harry Belafonte, Jackson Brown and others to celebrate the life of Native American activist Leonard Peltier, and issued an audiobook entitled Peter Seeger: The Storm King, Stories, Narratives and Poems (which was nominated for a Grammy). Toshi, his wife of 70 years who helped manage Pete's career, died in July 2014, just six months before him. Despite the enormous loss, Pete kept on singing. He sang ""I Come and Stand at Every Door"" on Democracy Now to commemorate the 68th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. He sang ""This Land is Your Land"" (adding an anti-fracking verse) at the Farm Aid concert in Saratoga Springs (joined by Willie Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp, and Dave Matthews). A month before he died he performed at a concert in Nyack to benefit the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a peace group. Probably no song reflects Pete's indomitable spirit more than ""Quite Early Morning,"" the song he sang on the Colbert Report in 2012. Don't you know it's darkest before the dawn And it's this thought keeps me moving on If we could heed these early warnings The time is now quite early morning If we could heed these early warnings The time is now quite early morningPete's fingers can strum no longer, but, thanks to him, people around the world can have many ""singing tomorrows.""Peter Dreier teaches politics and chairs the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College. His latest book is The 100 Greatest American of the 20th Century: A Social Justice Hall of Fame (Nation Books, 2012). Pete Seeger is one of the people profiled in the book.  "
2,POLITICS,Dem Donors Plot Campaign Battle Against $889 Million Koch Behemoth,Sam Stein and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/koch-brothers-2016_n_6564948.html,,2015-01-28,"FILE - In this Aug. 30, 2013, file photo, Americans for Prosperity Foundation Chairman David Koch speaks in Orlando, Fla. The United Negro College Fund announced a $25 million grant from Koch Industries Inc. and the Charles Koch Foundation, a large donation from the conservative powerhouse Koch name that Democrats have sought to vilify heading into the 2014 mid-term elections. (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e629260000350083bf58.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Reactions from Democrats to news that the billionaire Koch brothers are planning an $889 million blitz for the 2016 election has run the gamut from outright alarm to shoulder shrugs. Various top party officials interviewed by The Huffington Post said they expected outside groups and campaign committees to further elevate their attacks on the Kochs heading into the next election. Portraying the brothers as political villains was a prominent element of the 2014 game plan. And though that election ended horribly for the party, there is little sense that Democrats should back off now that Koch entities will play an even larger role in 2016. “We’re going all out with the research and the communications in the 2016 cycle,” David Brock, founder of American Bridge 21st Century and MediaMatters.org, told The Huffington Post.But in donor circles, talk has centered not just on communications strategies but on checkbooks as well. Matching the nearly $1 billion in conservative money is going to prove monumentally challenging, if not impossible, officials concede. One top Democratic donor, speaking on condition of anonymity, marveled at how the millions he has given to the party now seem quaint. He then turned his attention to liberal billionaires who aren't yet engaged in electoral politics. ""They may not like it,"" the donor said, ""but at this moment, they are in a special position to influence the course of history for the better, and they have a responsibility to band together and put up the money we need.""Other donors, including those in Hillary Clinton's orbit, weren't quite ready to sound the clarion call for liberal billionaires sitting on the sidelines. The expectation is that the former secretary of state will have a lucrative funding network to fall back on when she chooses to enter the race. And several top money men in the party said that Clinton would rely on veterans of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns to help tap into the grassroots donor network that propelled him to the White House. ""For her,"" said one top Clinton donor, ""I don’t believe raising large sums of money will be the main issue."" ""I’m not panicked by this,"" said Steve Elmendorf, a longtime Democratic adviser, lobbyist and donor with close ties to the Clintons. ""I think it is unfortunate that two people can spend that much money in politics. But we will just have to redouble our efforts. … What are people supposed to do: 'Oh my god, we have to go out and find a billionaire!' People can wring their hands and say this is terrible. But we don’t have people like that, we just don’t.""What Democrats do have, Elmendorf added, is a number of very wealthy donors who are interested more in specific causes than party politics. And while their money has certainly helped elect like-minded individuals to office, it likely will be neither vast enough to match conservative resources nor uniformly directed enough to lift all Democratic lawmakers. Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance, a network of liberal donors, said that many of the group's members ""are very active in the electoral sphere, and will work hard for the election of progressives to the White House, Congress and State Houses."" But the money the group spent -- and LaMarche said they expect to exceed all ""previous contribution records"" -- would go toward other functions as well. ""Many have asked whether progressive donors, in the Democracy Alliance and related organizations, will match [the Koch brothers]. But that's the wrong question,"" emailed LaMarche. ""[O]ur donors are focused on building a long-term infrastructure at the state, local and national level, to push for progressive values and policies no matter what party is in office.""Democrats have more recently streamlined their super PAC infrastructure. They’ve set up entities that allow donors to focus on specific races, and have sought to create a highly coordinated operation within their network of groups. They have also expanded this approach to state-level campaigns with the launch of super PACs targeting state legislative races and secretary of state campaigns. In the State Innovation Exchange, Democratic operatives have even created a progressive counterweight to the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, a nonprofit forum for corporations, conservative activists and state lawmakers to draft conservative legislation together.Much of this is to catch up to the political and policy apparatus receiving funding from the Kochs and their donor network. The Kochs have been ahead of the game in capital-intensive political efforts: launching state affiliates of their Americans for Prosperity; funding ALEC; and engaging in state elections at all levels. They are now trying to match the Democratic strength in labor-intensive political organizing, as they plan to hire 1,500 grassroots organizers for their 2016 push, according to Politico. Even if they cannot match the Kochs’ $889 million, Democrats believe they can compete if they maintain the disciplined approach taken in the 2012 election.“At the end of the day the Republican and conservative groups are always going to win this kind of spending arms race,” Brock said. “What we’ve found is that we need a healthy amount of resources in order to be competitive but we don’t need to match them dollar for dollar.”Those resources will still go into attacks on the Kochs. But Brock said that he expects the jabs to be more refined in 2016. Rather than label the brothers as nefarious influence-peddlers (which, he says, voters assume everyone with money is), they will be honing in on specific cases of Republicans advancing their benefactors' priorities. “[Y]ou really have to get down to the specifics of marrying the spending to the Kochs’ agenda, which when people are told about it, isn’t popular, and to the self-interested aspects of how the political change they are trying to make benefits their bottom line,"" said Brock. Targeting like this was tried in the 2014 campaign by Democratic-backing organizations. NextGen Climate, the super PAC backed by $70 million from the billionaire former hedge fund executive-turned-environmentalist Tom Steyer, ran an ad stating that Koch Industries had polluted Detroit’s 48217 zip code and was now dumping money into Terri Lynn Land’s Senate campaign. NextGen Climate spokesman Chris Lehane told HuffPost that Steyer’s group would continue with this type of attack ad in 2016, describing it as ""using the Kochs as a fully weighted oil drum that we tie to the Republican candidates and presidential candidate."" In an email to HuffPost, Lehane tried to allay Democratic concerns about whether those ads will get drowned out by the $889 million from the other side.“Given all of this, it only reinforces that Tom [Steyer] -- along with other progressive groups -- are the David taking on the Koch Goliath,” Lehane wrote. “The good news is that because of Tom and others we do have the resources to deploy a slingshot that will fire hard, fire fast and fire on target and we can make up the delta between our resources and the amount of money being spent by the Kochs because we have truth and justice on our side.”"

""Recent declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power.""In making its announcement, the Fed largely skirted over slumping economies in Europe and Asia, saying only that it would take ""financial and international developments"" into account when determining when to raise rates. In their last statement in December, the Fed had only noted ""financial developments.""The U.S. central bank's stance stands in sharp contrast to many of its peers in developed countries, which have recently eased monetary policy to boost their struggling economies. The policy divergence has helped push the U.S. dollar to multi-year highs.""You would have thought that if you were going to really postpone (a rate hike) to 2016 there would have been some more emphasis on international events and the dollar,"" said John Silva, an economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina.The S&P 500 stock index turned negative after the statement was released, while the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond returned to a record low. The dollar strengthened against a broad index of foreign currencies.Many Fed officials have pointed to a possible rate increase around mid-year, but they again left the door open to a later move. ""The committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy,"" Fed said.The central bank acknowledged inflation had declined further below its 2 percent target and that market-based price gauges had fallen substantially - a more negative assessment than in December.The latest statement follows a policy shift begun in December when the Fed first said it would take a patient approach to raising rates. At that time, Fed Chair Janet Yellen made clear that ""patient"" meant at least two meetings.In December, the Fed said that approach was consistent with its previous guidance of keeping rates near zero for a ""considerable time."" The statement on Wednesday removed the reference to its former guidance.The statement was adopted without dissent.

Instead of surrounding yourself with ideologues, why not reach out to your diverse populace, and try to actually exercise the art of governing -- bridging differences to arrive at compromise -- rather than trying to cram a narrow agenda down the throats of Kansas citizens?You act as though your most recent election gives you a broad mandate, when in fact your margin of victory was slim. You act as though your constituents speak in a monolithic voice, audaciously proclaiming Kansas ""the most pro-life state in America,"" when you lost re-election in my home county, where many, like me, identify themselves as pro-choice.Your speech reflected a huge disconnect between your rhetoric and the reality in the state. You proclaimed: ""We are at our best when we stir within ourselves our better angels. When our hearts are tender to what God is tender to ... the poor, the voiceless, the powerless."" And yet you have refused to expand Medicaid benefits available under the Affordable Care Act. You took the administration and distribution of welfare and disability payments out of the hands of knowledgeable state employees, and transferred those duties to private firms woefully behind the curve in serving the very populace you say should be tender to our hearts.You closed your speech by invoking the wisdom of the Ancients. This was actually a welcome change from the Christian God you normally invoke, blithely assuming that all your state's residents are Christians, or believers at all. You say the Ancients would have us be ""first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.""Was your campaign pure, peaceable, gentle, open to reason, sincere? Recent news reports suggest that a grand jury is investigating the loans made by your lieutenant governor, a plastic surgeon, to your campaign coffers, loans designed to fatten your campaign purse and make it seem you had more financial backing than you did in fact possess. According to a news report in the Topeka Capital-Journal, Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer loaned the campaign $500,000 two different times right before campaign finance reports were due. Both loans were repaid shortly after. A third $500,000 loan was reportedly paid back in part. Your rhetoric of piety and purity is contradicted by these shell games.In addition, the Capital-Journal reports that the FBI is looking into possible influence-peddling by figures close to your administration. Your lofty rhetoric suggests that you know there is a higher road. Governor, abandon your narrow agenda. Walk with the Ancients, and take a path that is more consistent with enduring ideals and broad-minded ideas.Be expansive, be inclusive, be democratic in the small ""d"" sense of the word. I'm not asking you to switch political parties, but rather to govern as though you better appreciate the concerns of the many competing constituencies you are supposed to represent in the state's highest office. Consider your legacy, and make sure your actions are more consistent with your words. Be your better self.***I'm not so naive as to think that the governor will take my advice.

Here's why.",2015-01-28,"FILE - In this May 18, 2009 file photo, Tom DeLonge, left, drummer Travis Barker, and singer and musician Mark Hoppus, right, of the rock band Blink-182 arrive at the Blink-182 tour launch party in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Dan Steinberg, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4a0a42100002501c813d5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Don't leave me."" ""So sorry, it's over."" ""I think it's time that I should leave."" ""Will the last one out please shut the door?""Tom DeLonge's so-called indefinite hiatus from Blink-182 may have come out of nowhere this week, but in retrospect, it looks like he and fellow founding member Mark Hoppus gave us years' worth of foreshadowing lyrics, not to mention an entire self-titled album chronicling the beginning, middle and end of a relationship. The public back-and-forth that has taken place between them since Sunday has been a lot of things -- acrimonious, confusing, childish (the latter being par for the course for guys who made a living acting like permanent teenagers) -- but for anyone who has followed the group since its late-1990s heyday, ""surprising"" is not among them.There are a variety of reasons why the end was almost to be expected, but first, a quick history lesson: Though the duo had done moderately well in pop-punk-friendly Southern California in the mid-'90s, and later enjoyed huge mainstream success after adding drummer Travis Barker, Hoppus and DeLonge were unable to keep the band together, and in 2005 watched both the band and their personal relationship disintegrate so completely that they pulled out of an Indonesian tsunami benefit show, deciding that having to stand on the same stage was not worth helping raise money for disaster victims.After all three had moved on to other projects and interests, they reunited in 2009 after Barker had narrowly escaped death in a plane crash. But the years since have been far from fruitful, yielding just over an album's worth of new songs that did not come close to recapturing the magic that put Blink-182 on the map to begin with. It now looks very possible that the trio has played together for the last time, as Hoppus and Barker have enlisted a guest guitarist to fill in on upcoming dates to which the band had already committed to play.DeLonge's departure, as well as how abruptly it occurred (and how publicly it was announced by his scorned bandmates), may have seemed surprising, but in reality the latest Blink-182 hiatus was not hard to see coming. Here's why:Money first, music second. The name Blink-182 is as much a commodity as it is a musical identity. Today, the band's official web site offers no news, no band-member bios, no music for sale; instead, the entire site is devoted to selling apparel and accessories emblazoned with the group's name and logo. A quick conclusion would be that perhaps these guys are at this point more about moving merch, and less about making music.No new music. One possible reason why music isn't available on the site is because there hasn't been any for years. Though the band hyped up its 2009 return with an on-stage announcement at the Grammys and a full-blown tour, the years since have yielded only a mediocre full-length album (which Barker told Rolling Stone earlier this week that DeLonge ""didn't even care about"") and a self-produced five-song EP. In the same time period, Angels & Airwaves -- the band DeLonge started after Blink-182's initial demise a decade ago -- has released five studio albums and a couple of films, so it's not like the band members are out of ideas.Separate lives in separate places. Hoppus admitted to Rolling Stone of himself and Barker, ""I don't think either of us have spoken to Tom in person in months."" The lack of communication between band members is startling to read about. It is, however, not surprising. Once the band got huge in the late 1990s, Hoppus packed up and moved to Hollywood, putting him and the others in different cities. Today he lives a full continent away, in London, with Barker in Los Angeles and DeLonge in San Diego. Hoppus says that, years removed from its last release, plans to record new music had not gotten beyond each member recording ideas and storing them on personal hard drives, to be shared whenever the three could finally get to the same place at the same time.Too much time gone by. By the time that Barker's plane crash brought the trio back together, all had gone on to other high-profile projects. Despite his laughably bombastic claims that Angels & Airwaves would singlehandedly redefine rock music, DeLonge's follow-up act has maintained a fiercely loyal fan base for nearly a decade; Hoppus found a home hosting a program on the Fuse network; and Barker starred in his own MTV reality show. Trying to reunite three people who had not only gone their own ways, but found success after Blink-182, was doomed to fail. The band certainly had a financial incentive to tour, but after so much time apart, its members weren't going to be able to write music that sounded like Blink-182 anymore.That ship has sailed. While fans have clamored to see the band play festivals and other one-off shows, there is simply not much interest in, or room for, new Blink-182 music in 2015. From its inception, anything other than a nostalgia-based second coming was going to be impossible in large part because a huge amount of its hit songs and videos were about being young, and it's hard to imagine three middle-age fathers still able to write snarky material about the prom and sneaking out of the house to meet girls.Had the feud not been made so public this week, and had the three people involved actually spoken to each other instead of sending messages through reporters and social networks, we might be able to envision more material from Blink-182 in the future. It's hard to see it happening now, though.Perhaps if they want to record new music, Hoppus and Barker should resurrect their own post-Blink-182 band, +44. If nothing else, it would give them an excuse to unearth their song ""No It Isn't"" and, in the process, have an all-new reason to sing the words, ""Please understand, this isn't just 'goodbye,' this is 'I can't stand you.'"""

In 2014, a Jeddah scholar condemned  the practice of taking selfies during Muslim’s hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The pilgrimage is meant to be a time of introspection, Scholar Sheikh Assim Al-Hakeem argued, and selfies seemed to be a way of boasting and showing off. But Siauw’s tirade against the selfie wasn’t received well in Indonesia, Quartz reports, where the number of people using smartphones has surged in recent years. According to Google Trends, Indonesia was one of the first countries in Southeast Asia where people began searching for selfie sticks in earnest.It wasn’t long before Indonesian youth retaliated in defense of the duck face. In fact, Siauw’s condemnation resulted in the explosion of even more selfies. Using the hashtag #Selfie4Siauw, Indonesians are fighting the idea that posting a selfie somehow taints your relationship with God.

Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a longtime opponent of abortion, announced in an op-ed on Tuesday that he now supports abortion rights after having talked to women in difficult circumstances throughout his home state.""I have sat with women from Ohio and across the nation and heard them talk about their varying experiences: abusive relationships, financial hardship, health scares, rape and incest,"" wrote Ryan. ""These women gave me a better understanding of how complex and difficult certain situations can become. And while there are people of good conscience on both sides of this argument, one thing has become abundantly clear to me: the heavy hand of government must not make this decision for women and families."" Ryan, who was raised Catholic, has long considered himself ""pro-life"" and has voted for numerous abortion restrictions since he was elected to Congress in 2003, including parental notification laws; restrictions on abortion funding in health care reform; and a ban on abortions in federally funded military hospitals. In 2009, he wrote an op-ed for U.S. News and World Report underscoring the need for fellow anti-abortion lawmakers to work with abortion rights supporters on solutions to prevent unplanned pregnancies. Now Ryan, who recently has been discussed as a potential candidate for Senate, wants to make it clear to his constituents that his views have evolved. ""Today, I am a 41-year-old father and husband whose feelings on this issue have changed,"" he wrote. ""I have come a long way since being a single, 26-year-old state senator, and I am not afraid to say that my position has evolved as my experiences have broadened, deepened and become more personal. And while I have deep respect for people on both sides of this conversation, I would be abandoning my own conscience and judgment if I held a position that I no longer believed appropriate. I have come to believe that we must trust women and families—not politicians—to make the best decision for their lives.”Ryan in 2013 voted against a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and he wrote in his op-ed Tuesday that he hopes to push Congress to look for ways to prevent the need for abortion instead of cutting off women's access to the procedure. ""No federal or state law banning abortion can honestly and fairly take into account the various circumstances that make each decision unique,"" Ryan wrote. ""Where government does have the ability to play a significant role is in giving women and families the tools they need to prevent unintended pregnancies by expanding education and access to contraception.""Ohio's Planned Parenthood affiliate celebrated Ryan's change of heart. “We are humbled by Congressman Ryan’s heartfelt commentary about a topic that is too often politicized and stigmatized,” Stephanie Kight, CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio, said in a statement Wednesday. “We look forward to working with Congressman Ryan to ensure that all women -- no matter where they live or how much money they have -- can access the care they need without political interference.”"

The nations negotiated a successful swap of prisoners. The onerous travel restrictions the U.S. government placed on just visiting the island are starting to crumble. Embassies in Washington and Havana will soon be opened. Rules designed to ease trade are being written. But despite this long-awaited meltdown of U.S. policies that added to the island's economic woes but never succeeded in tumbling Cuba's communist government, a portion of the Cold War edifice remains intact: Cuba is still on the U.S. state sponsors of terrorism list.This list, reserved for countries that have ""repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,"" is a very short one. It doesn't include Saudi Arabia, the country that accounted for 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 and has been responsible for spreading extremist Wahhabi ideology throughout the Middle East. It doesn't include Pakistan, a country that has long been a staging ground for Islamic terrorists and on the receiving end of U.S. drone strikes for the past decade. It certainly doesn't include Israel, a country Amnesty International called ""trigger happy"" for using ""unnecessary, arbitrary and brutal force"" against Palestinians. It doesn't even include North Korea, a country that recently threatened to bomb the ""White House, the Pentagon and the whole U.S. mainland.""Of the world's 196 countries, only four are included: Iran, Sudan, Syria... and Cuba.The U.S. government first put Cuba on the list three decades ago, in 1982, accusing the island of providing a safe haven for members of the Basque separatist group ETA and Colombia's FARC rebels. It also accused Cuba of providing political asylum to Americans facing criminal and terrorism charges. In 2006, the State Department added that Cuba opposed the U.S.-led war on terror and made no attempt to ""track, block, or seize terrorist assets.""Over the years, these accusations have faded as Latin American dictatorships were overthrown and leftist groups started using the ballot instead of bullets to gain power. In Columbia, where decades-long fighting between government and guerrilla groups persists, Cuba has become an internationally recognized and appreciated mediator hosting peace talks. The ETA called a ceasefire in 2011 and said it would disarm. And despite U.S. accusations, after 9/11 Fidel Castro roundly condemned terrorism, refused to harbor individuals wanted for terrorism, and signed onto all UN-sanctioned anti-terrorism treaties.In its 2013 Report on Terrorism, the State Department admitted that Cuba's links to ETA have become more distant and that Cuba has been hosting negotiations between Colombia's government and FARC rebels. It also mentioned how there has been no indication that the Cuban government ""provided weapons or paramilitary training to terrorist groups.""Most people around the world would find it very strange that Cuba would be on a ""terrorist list,"" as it is most known worldwide for exporting doctors, musicians, teachers, artists, and dancers -- not terrorists.Cuba's continued inclusion on the terrorist list has become a stumbling block in negotiations. While both sides have been upbeat about the recent talks, Cuba has complained and demanded to be removed from the terrorist list. The Cuban government considers it insulting and unfair; it also notes the United States has repeatedly supported terrorist acts and harbored terrorist fugitives, such as Luis Posada Carriles, convicted in absentia of the bombing of Cubana Flight 455 in which 73 people were killed.Inclusion on the terrorist list is not just political jousting; it adds an extra burden to the economic restrictions associated with the long-standing U.S. economic embargo, especially on the banking system. All banks engaging in financial transactions with Cuba are subjected to tedious U.S. screenings to ensure that terrorist money does not enter the U.S. Banks dealing with countries on the U.S. terrorist list be slapped with major fines, such as the huge $8.9 billion penalty that French bank BNP Paribas paid last year for dealing with Cuba, Sudan and Iran. Most foreign banks -- even when engaged in perfectly legal transactions with Cuba, weigh their options and decide it's not worth the hassle.But change is in the air. Following the December 17, 2014 agreement to restore relations with Cuba, President Obama instructed the Secretary of State to launch a review of Cuba's inclusion on the list and provide a report and recommendation within six months.If the recommendation is to remove Cuba from the list, the president would have to submit a report to Congress 45 days before the new decision would take effect. The report would have to ensure that Cuba had not provided any support for international terrorism in the preceding six months, and then offer guarantees that it would not do so in the future.The decision to lift Cuban sanctions lies in the hands of Congress, but taking Cuba off the terrorist list is an action the president can take (he can also free the Guantanamo Bay prisoners who have been cleared for release -- but that's another issue). Cuban diplomats says they cannot conceive of re-establishing diplomatic relations with the United States while Cuba continues to be considered a sponsor of international terrorism. President Obama's next executive action should include removing Cuba from the list -- join us by sending him that message now."

Obama said, 'We believe in the promise of India, we believe in the people of India. We are proud to be your partner as you build the country of your dreams. We are not perfect countries, have known tragedies and triumphs, have lot of challenges, but our two nation posses the key to progress.' He spoke on the topic 'India & America: the future we can build together', describing the numerous opportunities that both countries have to build a constructive partnership. (Photo by Vipin Kumar/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e622240000310098fab3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Andy SullivanWASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - As Washington has tightened its belt in recent years, the budget cuts have sliced most deeply in states where President Obama is unpopular, according to an analysis of federal spending by Reuters.Between the 2009 and 2013 fiscal years, funding for a wide swath of discretionary grant programs, from Head Start preschool education to anti drug initiatives, fell by an average of 40 percent in Republican-leaning states like Texas and Mississippi.By contrast, funding to Democratic-leaning states such as California and politically competitive swing states like Ohio dropped by 25 percent.Though Congress sets overall spending levels, the Obama administration determines where much of that money ends up. Lawmakers also have curtailed their ability to direct money to their home states when they adopted a ban on spending in 2011 known as ""earmarks.""That has given administration officials more power to steer money to places that might return the favor with votes, said John Hudak, an expert on federal spending at the centrist Brookings Institution who worked with Reuters on the analysis.""In the context of the Obama administration, swing states and blue states are doing better than red states,"" said Hudak, who uncovered similar spending patterns by previous presidents in his book ""Presidential Pork.""""I would suggest these numbers would tell us there is politicization going on,"" he said. For the analysis, Reuters divided the U.S. into three categories: Republican-leaning ""red"" states where Obama got less than 45 percent of the vote in the 2012 election; competitive ""purple"" states where he won between 45 percent and 55 percent of the vote; and Democratic-leaning ""blue"" states where he won more than 55 percent of the vote.Red, purple and blue states have all shouldered steep spending cuts after a 2011 budget deal, the analysis found. But those cuts have not been doled out evenly.Discretionary grant funding to red states like Mississippi fell by 40 percent to $15 billion between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2013, the most recent year for which reliable figures are available. Purple states like Ohio and North Carolina saw a smaller drop of 27 percent, to $19.8 billion, and blue states saw a yet-smaller drop of 22.5 percent, to $27.6 billion. (The tally does not include disaster aid handed out after Hurricane Sandy, which went largely to blue states like New Jersey.)The disparity doesn't show up in payments like Medicaid that are distributed through pre-set formulas. It also does not appear in Obama's 2009 recession-fighting Recovery Act. It only shows up in federal aid that is most directly controlled by the administration: ""project grants,"" which are doled out on a competitive basis by career civil servants and political appointees.Of course, many factors other than politics come into play. Some states aren't good at writing grant proposals - researchers at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, for example, found that poor planning has hurt that state's ability to compete for federal dollars. A governor from an oil-producing state may be less inclined to pursue green-energy grants.But the disparity can't be fully explained by these factors. At Reuters' request, Hudak ran a statistical analysis of spending over this period, controlling for differences in population, economy, percentage of elderly residents, miles of federal highway and the number of research universities and hospitals.Red states still came up short. After 2011, the average red state got 15 percent fewer grants and 1.3 percent fewer grant dollars than the average swing state. That comes out to roughly 500 grants and $15 million for an average-sized red state like Tennessee - enough to pay for 115 additional police officers or upgrade a rural airport to handle larger planes. PLAYING POLITICSVeterans of both Democratic and Republican administrations say privately that politics often come into play with such grants. Money to help upgrade a train depot may not boost a president's approval rating in a state where he is deeply unpopular, but it might make a difference in a competitive state like Colorado.This approach isn't unique to Obama. Under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Hudak found that purple states got about 7.3 percent more grants and 5.7 percent more grant dollars than states that were firmly in one camp.The Obama administration did not explain why Republican-leaning states have borne the steepest budget cuts, and several Democratic lawmakers declined to comment.""The administration supports allocating federal grants based on objective criteria that will help protect taxpayer dollars and ensure that lawmakers are responsible and accountable to the American people,"" the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a statement to Reuters.Project grants, which totaled $74 billion in the fiscal year ending September 2013, help pay for everything from homeless assistance to agricultural research. But they are also a good publicity tool for a president looking to show voters how he's making a difference in their communities.As Obama ran for re-election in 2012, administration officials traveled to battleground states to announce good news: $45 million for a manufacturing research center in Ohio; $8.2 million for a tech incubator in Gainesville, Florida; $18 million to extend a rail system in Charlotte, North Carolina. Each generated favorable coverage in local news outlets.Those announcements were less common in states where Obama had no hope of winning over his Republican rival Mitt Romney.Ohio, a key battleground state, won 10,232 grants in the fiscal year that ended in September 2012, just before the election - an increase of 21 percent over fiscal 2009. Ruby-red Texas saw the number of grants it was awarded over that period drop by 37 percent, to 10,775, according to Reuters figures.In dollar terms, according to Reuters data, the difference was just as dramatic. Grant money for Texas dropped 43 percent, to $4.0 billion, over that time period. Dollars to Ohio declined 16.5 percent, to $2.0 billion. EARMARK NOSTALGIAThe big problem for lawmakers? They lost their ability to influence the flow of that money. Before the earmark ban, states with elected officials who oversee spending on the Senate Appropriations Committee got about 7.6 percent more grant dollars than other states, Hudak found. After the 2011 earmark ban, evidence of clout disappeared.Republican Representative John Culberson used to insert earmarks into spending bills to steer medical research and other projects to his Houston-area district. Since the ban took effect, he says he's had trouble getting the administration to pay for border control, harbor dredging and even send aid to mop up after a chemical plant explosion.""The Obama administration approaches the federal government the same way the Chicago machine politicians approach the Chicago public treasury: it's to be used for their own benefit,"" he said.Some Republicans worry they've handed too much control to the administration. But Congress, under the watch of Republican House Speaker John Boehner, isn't likely to lift the earmark ban any time soon.""Speaker Boehner is proud of the reforms we have put in place,"" spokesman Michael Steel said, ""and believes more should be done to ensure that Washington makes responsible decisions about taxpayers' money.""

The church is promising to support some housing and job protections for gays and lesbians in exchange for legal protections for believers who object to the behavior of others.

The press conference was, in fact, mostly about defending Mormons' right to discriminate.Major news organizations led with headlines claiming the Mormon church had come out in favor of LGBTQ rights. The New York Times: ""Mormon Leaders Call for Measures Protecting Gay Rights."" ABC: ""Mormon Leaders Call for Measures Protecting Gay Rights.CNN: ""Mormon church backs LGBT rights -- with one condition."" But if you go to the Mormon church's own website, what you'll find is a news release titled ""Mormon Leaders Call for Laws That Protect Religious Freedom."" The Mormon church's latest maneuver is not about gay rights. It is primarily about giving believers the right to discriminate. The new Mormon position is like that candy with a razor blade inside that your mom warned you about on Halloween. While calling for LGBTQ people to be protected from those who hate them for non-religious reasons (and who are those people, anyway?), they have hidden their real agenda, which is to legalize such discrimination by anyone who claims their prejudice is backed by faith.Today's press conference took place in a twilight zone where parents are in danger of being jailed for teaching their kids about Jesus, and where believers can't ""share their views openly in the public square."" Oh, please. Show me the Mormons who have been jailed for sharing their views. There are none. And if you can point to one instance of the government preventing good Mormons from practicing their religion in their homes, we'll eat our hat. One of three speakers at the press conference was Dallin Oaks. He has long been the Mormon church's lead antagonist of gay people. A few years ago Mr. Oaks was asked what a parent should say to their own gay child if he asked, ""Can I bring my partner to our home to visit?"" Mr. Oaks said, ""I can imagine some circumstances in which it might be possible to say, 'Yes, come, but don't expect to stay overnight. Don't expect to be a lengthy house guest. Don't expect us to take you out and introduce you to our friends, or to deal with you in a public situation that would imply our approval of your 'partnership.'"" It is galling that the LDS church would use him as a mediator with the LGBTQ community.The key moment in Mr. Oaks' speech comes when he claims, ""Churches should stand on at least as strong a footing as any other entity when they enter the public sphere to participate in public policy debates."" At least as strong? Why does Mr. Oaks think that religions should enjoy more influence than other entities? He wants special privileges and special rights for churches and for religious people. The painful irony? He is demanding something gay people have long been accused of seeking: special rights. The LGBTQ movement only demands equal rights. We want to be treated fairly. It is the religious people in this country who demand special treatment, who receive special treatment, and it is profoundly inappropriate.If these Mormon leaders were true disciples of Jesus, they would hold a press conference tomorrow and complain about the Pharisees in their ranks. They would apologize for the hatred and intolerance that their church has shown gay people for decades. They would apologize in tears, remembering all the LGBTQ Mormons who have taken their lives because of the bigotry their church fostered. And they would unconditionally endorse legislation that protects gay people from discrimination, especially from religious people. Don't believe for one second that the LDS church this morning showed compassion or humanity. They're just trying to codify their right to discriminate against LGBTQ people. "

Japan has asked Jordan for help after the Islamic State jihadist group threatened to kill a Japanese journalist and a Jordanian pilot within 24 hours unless Amman frees a jailed female militant. AFP PHOTO / KAZUHIRO NOGI (Photo credit should read KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1447e260000350070a66a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was on a six-day tour of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, when the Islamic State posted a video online threatening to murder two Japanese hostages, Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, if his government did not pay $200 million within 72 hours. Abe had no good options. Indeed, when it comes to protecting its citizens overseas, Japan never does.When Abe failed to bow to its demands, ISIS released a second video claiming that Yukawa, who was seized last August in Syria while reportedly preparing to establish a Japan-based private security company, had been beheaded. Goto, a journalist who traveled to Syria last October to try to secure Yukawa's release, will supposedly be spared if Japan secures Jordan's release of a convicted terrorist.In fact, Goto's wife had received an email demanding a ransom of ¥2 billion ($17 million) in December. But it seems that Abe's Middle East tour presented a greater opportunity for ISIS to make the most of its Japanese hostages.ISIS's ransom demand was not just a bid for cash; it sent a powerful message. Just three days before the demand was made, Abe pledged to provide $200 million in non-military humanitarian aid to frontline countries in the fight against ISIS, including Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon, all of which have taken in large numbers of refugees.ISIS explicitly directed the video to both Japan's government and its citizens, evidently hoping that the largely pacifist Japanese would press their leaders to back down. And, to some extent, their expectation was met; some opposition members of Japan's Diet tweeted that Abe should cancel the promised aid. Needless to say, Abe's government ignored their advice.When the ransom demand did not work, ISIS shifted its approach, but not its goal. The prisoner whose release it has demanded in exchange for Goto is Sajida al-Rishawi, who faces the death penalty in Jordan for her role in hotel bombings in Amman in 2005. The group seems to believe that forcing Japan and Jordan to negotiate such a trade could undermine the countries' longstanding relationship.ISIS probably knows that Japan has historically placed the safety of its own citizens above all other considerations -- even if it meant bowing to terrorists' demands. When the Japanese Red Army hijacked a Japan Airlines flight to Dhaka Airport in Bangladesh in 1977, Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda not only paid the $6 million ransom; he also resorted to the ""extralegal measure"" of handing over imprisoned members of the faction. ""The weight of a human life,"" he declared, ""is heavier than the earth itself.""This response stands in stark contrast to Israel's behavior a year earlier, when the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacked an Air France flight with 256 passengers. Instead of giving the group what they wanted -- the release of 53 militants imprisoned in Israel and four other countries -- the Israeli Army launched Operation Thunderbolt, rescuing the hostages at Uganda's Entebbe Airport. Only three hostages and one Israeli commando -- Yonatan Netanyahu, the elder brother of current Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu -- were killed in the operation.But Fukuda's response was not entirely a matter of choice. Under Japan's constitution, neither the country's self-defense forces nor the police would have had legal grounds to travel overseas to rescue endangered Japanese citizens. In any case, neither force would have had the training necessary to pull off something like Operation Thunderbolt.The Dhaka episode was hardly the first time that threats against Japanese citizens had exposed this shortcoming. Seven years earlier, a forerunner to the Japanese Red Army hijacked another Japan Airlines flight -- the ""Yodogo"" -- and demanded to be taken to North Korea. The Japanese authorities got lucky: When the pilot landed first in South Korea, the hijackers released their 129 hostages in exchange for permission to continue to Pyongyang, where they gained asylum.Two years later, three members of the Japanese Red Army, recruited by the PFLP, attacked Tel Aviv's Lod Airport, killing 26 people and injuring 80 others. And, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the wives of the Yodogo hijackers went to Europe, where they are suspected of abducting young Japanese students and taking them to North Korea.As ISIS' actions demonstrate, Japanese are still at risk -- and their government still lacks adequate tools to protect them. Fortunately, Abe -- whose efforts to rescue Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea fueled his political rise -- seems to recognize the need for change.Since World War II, military considerations have barely factored into Japanese policy, and official development assistance, which began as war reparations, has placed international imperatives above domestic concerns. But, after playing benefactor to the world for 60 years, Japan's diplomatic and crisis management capabilities have been severely weakened.It is unacceptable for a government to be unable to protect its own citizens. That is why Abe is determined to amend, or at least reinterpret, Japan's constitution to allow for the kinds of defense maneuvers that other countries, from Israel to India, employ when their people are threatened.

After Republicans took control of the governor's mansion and both chambers of the state legislature in 2012, the party's leadership moved swiftly to cut unemployment benefits, eliminate the earned income tax credit, slash corporate tax rates, cut education spending and restrict voting rights. The Moral Monday movement began in response to these actions, with thousands gathering weekly at the state capitol. The group was not deterred by GOP wins in the state in 2014, the Rev. William Barber II, one of the movement's leaders, told The Huffington Post. Former State House Speaker Thom Tillis (R) -- whom Barber called the ""architect"" of the legislature's rightward shift -- defeated former Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) in a close race, and the GOP solidified veto-proof majorities in the state House. ""We believe we go into this year with a lot of momentum,"" Barber said. ""Sure, [conservative legislators] are extremists and they will probably try to continue their extreme agenda, but it’s setting up a real showdown with the people.""The legislature has addressed raising teacher pay, an issue the Moral Monday movement champions. The minimum salary for a North Carolina public school teacher is expected to go up this year, following a controversial bump some teachers already received last year.Moral Monday also hopes to push North Carolina to adopt Medicaid expansion as included in the Affordable Care Act. An estimated 500,000 North Carolinians would gain coverage if the state expanded the program. Some politicians in the state have recently come out in favor, and even Gov. Pat McCrory (R) has said he is considering pushing for expansion. He met with President Barack Obama earlier this month and raised the possibility of a waiver that would require employment or job training for residents to be eligible for the program. But both state Senate President Phil Berger (R) and House Speaker Tim Moore (R) oppose Medicaid expansion, and the North Carolina General Assembly passed a law in 2013 barring any expansion without its approval.Barber pointed to various polling data -- including those that show falling support for the legislature and increased support for Medicaid expansion -- to make the case that the movement has influenced public opinion. He also argued Tillis' narrow victory over Hagan demonstrated the movement's effectiveness in the months leading up to the election.""They threw their best at us and the best they could do was a 1.6 percent margin, which actually has emboldened our people to say, if we keep organizing, building and litigating, we can turn this tide,"" he said.

She barrels toward you with the zeal of someone who couldn’t possibly have anywhere else in the world to be. And she didn’t: Her latest film, “Sleeping with Other People,” had its world premiere on Saturday night of the fest, marking Headland’s second Sundance debut after the 2012 comedy “Bachelorette.” By Sunday morning, the buzz in Park City, Utah, had christened this the year of Sexy Sundance. “The Bronze,” “The Overnight,” “The D Train,” “I Am Michael” and “The Diary of a Teenage Girl” not only contained sex scenes that swayed between increasing levels of humor and eroticism, but each, in its own way, was a movie about sex. If the title alone doesn’t make ""Sleeping with Other People"" an obvious addition to the Sexy Sundance catalogue, consider this: In its standout scene, Jason Sudeikis instructs Alison Brie about proper masturbation techniques using an empty green-tea bottle.It might seem Headland, who wrote and directed the film, enjoys shock value. But like the outlandish “Bachelorette,” which featured Lizzy Caplan delivering a monologue about blow jobs, “Sleeping with Other People” tempers raunchy humor with a sweetness that belies its bawdiness. Which would double as a fitting Twitter bio for Headland.“I think it’s just the way that I talk with people,” she said. “I am a big softie. I cry at the drop of a hat. I’m so vulnerable about what I do and the relationships that I have in my life. And then I will say the most shocking, offensive things. Like, I just can’t help it. It just comes out. And I’m not sure where I got that from. It might have been being raised religiously, being raised Catholic ...""We’d been talking for only a few moments at this point, but someone from one of the broadcast-interview operations in Sundance’s press lounge walked over to ask we keep our voices down. “That’s not the first time that’s happened,” Headland said.“Maybe there’s something about being emotional and vulnerable where you want to say the thing that nobody wants to hear,” she continued, again conjuring memories of her Catholic-school upbringing. “Not to be shocking to be shocking, but you want to be, like, 'How does this make you feel?' Like, 'How does it make you feel if we really talk in-depth about the vagina? If we talk really in-depth about where the cervix is and actually put a name on these things?' It’s the same thing with the blow-job monologue in ‘Bachelorette.’ If we actually name stuff, how uncomfortable are you guys going to get? These are the things that we are all thinking. We’re talking about them behind closed doors.”In “Sleeping with Other People,” the characters are very much not thinking about these things from behind closed doors. Brie plays a neurotic sex addict with a hang-up on a married doctor (a mustachioed Adam Scott), with Sudeikis portraying the guy who deflowered her in college. When they reunite years later, they uphold a platonic relationship that carries an obvious romantic connection, á la “When Harry Met Sally,” one of the movies Headland counts as inspiration alongside “Carnal Knowledge,” “The Graduate,” “Punch-Drunk Love,” “Shampoo” and “Silver Linings Playbook” (as well as Jane Austen novels). She wanted sex to be the film's subject -- not to be vulgar, but in an effort to make a romantic comedy in which it does not serve solely as the couple’s reward at the end. Having one character teach another how to pleasure herself -- if you don’t know what a “dirty DJ” is, visit Urban Dictionary before seeing the film -- is culled directly from Headland’s life. After moving during her sophomore year of high school, Headland attended public school, first on a Maryland campus with primarily black and Hispanic students and later with an all-white, BMW-driving population in Connecticut. While drunk at parties, Headland, who didn’t have sex until college, would find herself in the corner educating her female friends about how to masturbate and informing her male friends what womanly anatomy provides the most stimulation. “I was like, 'Why don’t we just tell everyone where the fucking cervix is?'” she said. “'Why don’t we just tell everyone where the G-spot is?'”She introduced that notion to Sudeikis and Brie, who helped to flesh out the scene during rehearsals. What resulted is the film’s highlight: a fast-paced conversation that acts as a raunchy bookend to the duo’s honeyed interactions. “Jason, I feel, could sell a ketchup Popsicle to a woman wearing white gloves. He could play anything,” she said of directing the scene. “I just feel like he could make anything likeable and anything sexy and anything fun. And Alie, too -- just the right amount of turned on, but not too much. She’s just like, ‘Oh, oh, okay.’”Headland will be the first to tell you it’s a sort of antidote to “Fifty Shades of Grey,” which she says, along with “Gone Girl,” is an example of the contemporary evolution of Austenian social satire. “Can I just be honest? I couldn’t get through it,” she said when asked how she feels about E.L. James' novel. “I really was so ready to like it and be excited, and I was like, ‘This just isn’t sexy. It’s just not sexy.’ I was so intrigued by why people were loving it and I just didn’t find it as emotionally stimulating as I thought it was going to be.”What “Sleeping with Other People” boasts that -- according to Headland -- something like “Fifty Shades” doesn’t, is an intimacy not tied exclusively to the removal of clothes. “I think the reason that scene really resonates with people is not just because it’s super funny and super button-pushing and crazy, but I think it’s also because it’s this weird analogy or visualization of him teaching her about herself, which is really what intimacy is. You know what I mean? That’s actually what intimacy is: into you, you see me. Your partner teaches you about yourself, and so it’s this ridiculous thing -- or the wedding dress in ‘Bachelorette.’ But I think people connect to it because it is emotional. It ultimately is an emotional scene. That’s how I directed it and that’s how they played it.”"
