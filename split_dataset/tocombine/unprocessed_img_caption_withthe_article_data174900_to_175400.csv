This is not, of course, a new idea. There are sure to be as many people outfitted as the President or Governor Romney or elephants and donkeys and chads as there are e-mails from Barack Obama inviting me to dinner in my inbox. Still, with six days to go, could there be a better time to show your true colors?  As for me, I'd like to think I was one of the pioneers of six year olds literally ""playing"" politics.   This is me as Hillary Clinton for Halloween in 1996 (another one of those years). We were, of course, both younger then. Political costumes are particularly entertaining when worn by small children. (Or, rather, entertaining to adults. My classmates were less than impressed). If you do not have the benefit of being a small child, that's okay too. You still can put together an entertaining political Halloween costume, and you'll probably get invited to better parties with more (potential) voters in attendance.  With that in mind, consider some of these possibilities:The CEOs of Sesame Street: Everyone is doing Big Bird? Consider dressing up as his evil henchmen (far more Romney- like) 'Tax Me' Elmo and the Cookie Monster, who has been selfishly consuming 47% of the country's cookie supply.Clint Eastwood and the Empty Chair: A particularly good couple's costume if you are concerned that your date might stand you up last minute.Swing State: Bonus points if you incorporate an actual swing into your costume. I would recommend not using a tire swing, as the size and shape of the tire would take up a disproportionate amount of space in all directions--right, left, and center--and would force people to pay extra attention and go out of their way in order to maneuver around you. Hold on. On second thought, do wear a tire swing.U.S. Armed Forces in the Middle East: Watch out for people who accuse you of outstaying your welcome. WMDs in Iraq: The perfect costume if there's a party you're expected at but really don't want to attend - no need to even make an appearance! The Youth Vote: Please, please show up. En masse.The Electoral College: Carry a calculator and look very confused. Or carry a gavel and pretend you're a Supreme Court Justice who doesn't really care.Filibuster: Find the house handing out the best candy and position yourself right outside the doorway, blocking the way for all other trick-or-treaters.Remember, in some cities, Halloween celebrations can get pretty wild. Drive carefully. But, should you crash, explain to the other driver (and/or police officers) that it's performance art and part of your Halloween costume: This year, you're going as the economy."

Worse still, all nonprofit messages were being rejected from the city's transit line, Big Blue Bus.Could it be that my ""progressive"" city (I'm a 29-year resident) was now favoring large corporations over community organizations? Advertisements from oil companies? Allowed. Ads from environmental groups? Denied. Coca-Cola ads? Welcomed. Public service announcements from a diabetes foundation? Shunned. Promotions for Viagra? Yes. HIV awareness messages? No.After several months of trying to open a meaningful dialogue on the topic with Santa Monica city staff and having our efforts rebuffed, the picture became clear: The city's sudden ban was a decision made for the convenience of the the city's unelected leaders. It was based on a fixation on the possibility of litigation by groups with bad intentions, and implemented without community input. It also ignored the more likely prospect of litigation from groups with good intentions. (Right now the city is facing just such a suit from three residents, including me.) This bus-ad ban is serious and potentially deadly to the fight against AIDS, the future of organizations like AIDS Project Los Angeles (APLA) and the missions of nonprofit organizations throughout the country.If other cities travel the path that Santa Monica and its Big Blue Bus are currently taking, the future of events like the AIDS Walk Los Angeles, the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure and many of the most revered and worthwhile initiatives will be dealt a disastrous blow. They will be further disadvantaged in their competition with mindless, missionless messages from commercial corporations, messages to consume, consume, consume!The AIDS epidemic has taught us that government alone cannot address all social problems in a timely or effective manner. That is why this country has a robust nonprofit sector. Santa Monica's move to suppress these voices ignores a painful lesson of history and threatens to throw us back into the darkest days of discrimination. It also violates the values held dear by the residents of Santa Monica -- and the vast majority of Americans. Many cities are now confronting the question of what ads can and cannot run on public buses. The great cities will shape the conversation. They will hold public hearings. They will then hold robust, publicly accessible discussions among elected officials. Then great cities will bring forth regulations consistent with the values of their people. Great cities will lead and not be led; they will exercise self-determination and not surrender to extremists on the left or the right or to courts rendering the final verdict. Instead, great cities will stake out reasonable and informed policies and then, if needed, defend those policies in court. The city of Santa Monica stands at a crossroads. It can reverse its absurd new policy. It can take the path of great cities, show leadership and shape this debate. Or its leaders can be passive. They can be fear-driven instead of vision-driven. And they can let this debate roll over them, the First Amendment and their residents like a driverless bus. I sincerely hope that my city will be among the great ones."

Sounds like a stellar performance, right? It well may be. Unless you're one of the 890,000 vets still waiting. So what's the problem? Largely it's an issue of scale against a system. Sure, there are fewer vets from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. You've heard this statistic before: these wars are being fought by less than 1 percent of our population. Maybe that doesn't sound like much, but that 1% translates to more than 2.3 million soldiers, sailors and marines, of whom nearly half have more than one deployment. The nature of these wars with their IED's and multiple deployments means multiple injuries and complicated claims.At the end of May Marilynn Marchione, Chief Medical Writer for the Associated Press wrote that the average number of ailments on these claims is eight to nine. Claims coming in from the last year may have as many as eleven to fourteen. Here's a little perspective on that: the average number of ailments from Vietnam war vets is four; from World War II and Korea, it drops down to two. Inundated and backlogged even before this wave of returning vets hit, the VA is struggling.  Training, teams to process complicated claims and digital technology will all help. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Shinseki says that improvements in place by 2015 will reduce the processing time to 125 days That's still over four months. How does that play out? The widow of a World War II vet waits two years for benefits; here at the NVF, veterans on our staff wait months for education benefits to be paid. Let me cut to the bottom line here: we can't wait, and we can't ask these veterans to wait. We need some real leadership to step up, acknowledge the facts, and start working to fund the infrastructure needed to take care of these vets, now. In an election year, the voices of vets go largely unheard, over-ridden by other concerns. But what kind of a society asks its sons and daughters to sacrifice themselves for our freedoms, and then neglects them when they return to us?Look around. You're standing in the middle of the answer to that question. Speak up. Call your senator, your representatives. Talk to people. It's our responsibility to look after these veterans. It's time for action. From the top down, yes, but also from ordinary citizens. The most effective place to start? With your local representatives, state and federal. You can find them here.Emails work, phone calls work, and letters have even more power. Even short ones. Let's get this done! The job just gets bigger and bigger. Do your part for them. They sacrificed for you."

But here's one thing we all do know: gas prices in California went up this week. Gas stations near my house in the East Bay are posting prices around $5 per gallon, and it's a price spike found throughout the state, as this L.A. Times editorial makes clear.I found this comment in the L.A. Times story particularly illuminating: ""The recent pain at the pump can be explained away as the result of an August fire that closed a big Chevron refinery in Richmond, a pipeline disruption and a power outage that temporarily shut down an Exxon Mobil refinery in Torrance.""This is what we've come to expect: total reliance on a fossil fuel that's inherently volatile and risky to extract, move, and combust; one that has a price constantly going up or down based on man-made or natural disasters, not to mention global political threats.You'd think California businesses would be chomping at the bit for a way to move toward a more diversified, less volatile energy path, like the one envisioned by the three key pieces of AB32: cap and trade, a far-reaching Renewable Portfolio Standard, and a Low Carbon Fuel Standard. But in fact, as we inch closer to the inaugural AB32 cap and trade auction in November, some businesses have continued attempts to block this key part of California's climate change legislation.Thankfully, many other business groups throughout the state are outspoken AB32 enthusiasts. This week, Ruben Guerra of the Latin Business Association and Susan Frank of the California Business Alliance for a Green Economy proclaimed their support for the state's pioneering climate and clean energy law. These key business leaders remind us that AB32 will provide immense economic benefits for our economy - not just because it will diversify the energy sources on which California businesses depend, but also because it will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the state.Just last year, California's climate change legislation attracted $3.5 billion in private investment and created thousands of jobs. In a report released Tuesday, ""Counting up to Green,"" the Economic Policy Institute reports that green industries create jobs faster than the overall economy. Furthermore, the report indicates that green jobs offer significant opportunities for workers without a four-year college degree. That's over 60 percent of our workforce, and it's a set of workers particularly hard hit by the current recession.Research we've done at the Center for the Next Generation breaks this down for California, showing just how strong the green economy has grown in our state and how much potential there is in every county for still more jobs. By itself the wind sector now employs close to 5,000 workers across California.AB32 should be a no-brainer for California businesses, so long as it's done right. Implementing the law is a challenge we all face moving forward, but it's one that smart state businesses should be engaged in, not fighting against."

So far, their campaign cash and lucrative revolving-door jobs have kept them above the law, while their PR firms and personal salesmanship have largely exempted them from moral judgement in the inner corridors of wealth and power. Chicago in the 1920s, the Chicago of Al Capone, had nothing on today's Washington D.C.A new lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase is being met with both optimism and skepticism. But, ironically, investigators have finally broken their silence on criminal indictments for bankers... to protect its chief executive. The Chicago-style immunity enjoyed by today's bankers will only be broken if this recent lawsuit is followed by many more -- along with criminal indictments where appropriate. And these lawsuits will only deter future crimes if bankers are forced to make restitution from their own pockets, not their shareholders'.Look Who's Talking The Justice Department has been stonewalling the public for years on Wall Street crime by saying it ""can't comment on ongoing investigations."" But when it comes to investigations designed to exonerate those same bank CEOs, look who's talking now! ""Federal authorities are using taped phone conversations to build criminal cases related to the multibillion-dollar trading loss at JPMorgan Chase,"" The New York Times ""Dealbook"" blog reported this week, ""focusing on calls in which employees openly discussed how to value the troubled bets in a favorable way.""Why so chatty all of sudden, ""sources close to the investigation""? The answer becomes obvious a few paragraphs into the piece: ""The investigation does not appear to touch the upper echelons of the executive suite ... The findings could insulate JPMorgan and its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, from further fallout."" (emphasis ours)Got that? Investigators won't say a word when big bankers are under suspicion. But when talking will help them you can't shut 'em up!Lucky Jim And ah, yes. James ""Jamie"" Dimon. Dimon, the CEO whose bank has apparently been above the law, suddenly finds that his institution is the target of a criminal investigation. At long last. And the Justice Department's even willing to talk about it! But whaddya know? They're claiming it will exonerate Mr. Dimon. Jamie Dimon. Like the man in the Dylan song says: He can't help it if he's lucky. Dealbook's anonymous source is quite the chatterbox, even offering the names of the individual suspects -- most of whom, as fate would have it, are French citizens who have returned to their home country and are therefore beyond the reach of U.S. law. Zut alors! (Ah, how we wish we could indict them, one imagines the Justice Department official whispering to the journalist. But their government will not extradite. You know how it is with the French, our anonymous source adds with a shrug. I ask my friends at the Sûreté what can be done, but they merely light another Gauloise and sayC'est la vie.)Looks like Jamie Dimon's luck is contagious.London CallingEven this happy accident -- from a Justice Department that has yet to convict a single employee from a major bank! -- isn't the exoneration that Dealbook seems to think it is, not even if it were to genuinely clear Chase's senior executives on the original fraud. Au contraire, mes amis!There's evidence -- very public evidence -- which suggests that Dimon and other senior executives may have misled investors about the extent of the losses on an investor call. If true, that's a crime, too: It's called 'stock fraud.' and the SEC says it's investigating. In cases of this kind, the SEC must refer any evidence of a crime to the Justice Department for investigation. But when it comes to the investor fraud angle, the Chatty Kathies at the DOJ have apparently clammed up again.Mr. Dimon also reassured investors of JPM's fiscal soundness by describing the bank's rigorous internal risk management controls. What investors didn't know was that he apparently exempted the London unit from those controls without any public notice. That's also potentially illegal, under both Sarbanes-Oxley and the 1933 law that created the SEC.The London unit reportedly bypassed the bank's normal organizational chart and reported directly to Dimon himself. As CEO, Dimon is required to confirm in writing every year that he has personally reviewed the company's procedures to ensure that they prevent fraud of this kind. It's illegal to do so falsely.ProPublica's Jesse Eisenger asks the right question: What did Jamie Dimon know and when did he know it? But investigators are apparently too busy pursuing errant Frenchmen to ask it.Diamond Jamie   Dimon wasn't acting like somebody who was worried about accounting for his own actions this week. He was too busy traveling to Washington to lecture the government on what's doing wrong financially. ""Jamie Dimon is mad at the government,"" says CNN Money. Why? Because it's not cutting spending quickly enough to please him. Some people still have the silly notion that we need to help the millions of people who have been economically victimized by people like, well, like Jamie Dimon. When we call Dimon's JPMorgan Chase a serial corporate criminal, it's not empty rhetoric: It's documented fact. Chase was implicated in a recent municipal bid-rigging case which led to two convictions. It has paid settlements in six fraud cases over the last thirteen years. It paid more than $2 billion to settle fraud charges in the WorldCom case, $135 million in the Enron case, and more than $153 million to settle charges of investor fraud regarding mortgage-backed securities. JPM gave up nearly three quarters of a billion dollars in fines and lost fees over the Jefferson County, Alabama bribery case. Then there's the $25 million for unlawful IPO (stock) allocations; $25 million (and possibly more) for what was essentially illegal restraint of trade in forcing retailers to use the credit card network it co-owned; and $6 million regarding illegal profit-sharing and tie-ins at JPMorgan Chase Securities.And yet, other than a low-level guilty plea in the bribery case, no individual bankers have ever paid for these misdeeds -- not with jail time, and not even financially. As far as the Justice Department is concerned, it looks like all this fraud just... committed itself. These fines and settlements were all paid by shareholders. That's right: Nobody went to jail.   That means bankers at institutions like JPMorgan Chase have absolutely no reason not to keep breaking the law. Meanwhile Jamie Dimon, a man whose gluttony for praise rivals that of namesake Diamond Jim Brady's for food, roams the corridors of power seeking influence ... and flattery.New SuitsWhat about the lawsuit that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed recently against JPMorgan Chase? A certain skepticism was to be expected at this point, after the government's long-standing failure to take action and the many disappointments surrounding the $25 billion mortgage fraud lawsuit. Could this suit change that pattern?The Schneiderman lawsuit, filed with the long-moribund presidential task force on mortgage securities fraud, focuses on crimes committed at Bear Stearns, the subsidiary that JPMorgan Chase acquired with strong encouragement -- and a lot of financial incentives -- from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. Why not go after an active bank?There's also a new lawsuit against Wells Fargo involving what David Dayen describes as ""incendiary charges"" -- but which has been met with some skepticism as well. I shared the doubts, although I was heartened by an initial assessment from Prof. Adam Levitin. Levitin, who's highly respected in the field of bank fraud, thinks that this lawsuit could set an important precedent. The suit was filed under New York state's Martin Act, which allows for broader charges than Federal law does. Levitin observes that Schneiderman's is a ""platform-wide case"" covering a broad and long-standing pattern of fraudulent activity. ""That's a new type of suit,"" Levitin writes, ""not one that has been brought under the Martin Act before."" He adds that it ""majorly ups the ante for JPMorgan"" and ""covers an enormous volume of deals."" Levitin argues that this might result in substantial damages. If the Schneiderman suit is followed by filings against several other banks, as some stories have suggested, it could be the start of something important. But even if they're successful they'll fail to deter future Wall Street crimes -- that is, unless courts demand that bankers personally return their ill-gotten gains. And ultimately only prison sentences will deter future criminals.Will these lawsuits rock these banks back on their heels?Market PredictorsThe market doesn't seem to think so. It rewarded JPMorgan Chase with another excellent week of trading. It also offered its blessing to Wells Fargo, whose was filed under the False Claims Act which forbids defrauding the government and under the little-used FIRREA statute. If the market doubts that these banks will be brought to justice, it can hardly be blamed for that. Investors are letting recent experience guide their judgement. Some of us lapsed into optimism at this year's first attempts to hold banks accountable. Those of us who allowed ourselves to feel that optimism more than once wound up feeling like Charlie Brown. This Administration has pulled the football from us one too many times. So far the naysayers have had a better track record when it comes to predictions than we do. It's up to Schneiderman and the task force to prove them wrong.Good Grief, Charlie Prince!According to the Wells Fargo suit, the bank continued to illegally conceal its ""materially deficient"" loans until the end of 2010, well after the wheels of justice were allegedly turning against them. They clearly didn't believe it either.It was Charles Prince, CEO of crime-plagued and failed Citigroup, who most eloquently described the motivation behind bankers' willingness to follow each bubble, each greed-driven whim, as far as it will take them: ""As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance."" Looks like some of them are still dancing, So far nobody has made bankers pay for their crimes with criminal indictments, or even with fines paid from their own pockets rather than that of shareholders. And ego-driven financiers like ""Diamond"" Jamie Dimon haven't even faced much public approbation the actions of their institutions -- actions which include bribery and fraud. The mildest slights to their vanity throw them into rage, as a recent Vanity Fair article on Dimon demonstrates once again. But the real shaming they've earned has yet to be leivered.Yves Smith believes that ""One of these days, Dimon's lack of caution will catch up with him."" Let's hope so. But man, he sure is... lucky Hopefully Adam Levitin is right and the Bear Stearns suit is prelude for more actions to come. But those actions must have a deterrent effect which can only come when bankers are held personally accountable for their actions.Until then, for Jamie Dimon and other executives, the beat goes on."

Still others, including New Hampshire and the hardest hit state of Tennessee, have scheduled administrative hearings on possible violations.""It was New England Compounding Pharmacy's intent to conform to the rules of any state in which it sold its products to medical providers,"" a spokesman for the company said on Saturday in an emailed statement.The meningitis outbreak, which had killed 15 people as of Saturday, has highlighted the patchwork nature of state regulations and licensing requirements and a lack of federal oversight of compounding pharmacies such as NECC. [ID: nL1E8LD2UY]Compounding pharmacies produce special order medications for clinics and doctors but are not supposed to operate as pharmaceuticals manufacturers and ship drugs in bulk. 201 MENINGITIS CASESAuthorities have said up to 14,000 people could have received injections from the suspect medication shipped to 23 states by the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company. As of Saturday, 201 people were reported with meningitis in 14 states, the CDC and state officials in New Hampshire said.A separate Reuters investigation found that NECC failed to require proof of individual patient prescriptions as required by Massachusetts regulations, and solicited bulk orders from physicians, according to emails to a customer.Reuters reviewed more than a dozen emails that show NECC supplied one customer in Mississippi with drugs without patient names or prescriptions.On Thursday, the Massachusetts attorney general said it was investigating NECC to determine what led to the distribution of the suspect steroids and to determine any potential legal action.""This organization chose to apparently violate the licensing requirements under which they were allowed to operate,"" said Madeleine Biondolillo, director of the Bureau of Health Care and Safety at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.In Idaho, NECC is licensed to supply drugs for specific prescriptions as an out-of-state mail order pharmacy and it was unclear if it acted as a wholesaler or manufacturer, said Jan Atkinson, senior compliance officer at the state pharmacy board.Idaho facilities received some of the potentially tainted steroid medication typically injected to alleviate back pain and had reported one case of meningitis as of Saturday.Cori Anderson, spokeswoman for Pain Specialists in Idaho Falls, said the clinic received about 40 vials of the suspect medication directly from NECC and not directed at a patient.But laws are not consistent from state to state. Idaho law allows retail pharmacies, including mail-order pharmacies, to sell ""minimal quantities"" of prescription drugs to licensed practitioners for office use in a provision meant for covering short-term shortages, Atkinson said.The pharmacy board determines if shipments constitute ""minimal quantities"" on an individual basis, Atkinson said.""This may be a new area we need to address,"" she said. LICENSE SURRENDER?Tennessee, the state where patients first reported being sickened after the injections, said its pharmacy board will consider a request for NECC to surrender its license on Monday.Indiana's pharmacy board has turned an investigation over to the state attorney general, director Greg Pachmayr said. NECC was licensed to fill specific prescriptions in Indiana, which had reported two deaths among 27 people sickened as of Saturday.In Minnesota, the company is licensed to fill prescriptions for a specific patient and would need to be licensed as a wholesaler and a manufacturer to sell drugs in bulk, said Cody Wiberg, executive director of the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy.""You can't buy it in bulk from a pharmacy and then as you use it, write out a prescription for the patient and mail that back to the pharmacy,"" Wiberg said.Minnesota had reported four meningitis cases as of Saturday.Other states have ordered NECC to halt distributions, a moot point with the company voluntarily suspending operations. Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio suspended its license, while California ordered NECC distributions halted.The suspect drugs were administered to about 430 patients in Ohio and the state is investigating whether NECC broke any rules. It was registered as an out-of-state wholesaler but compounded drugs could only be ordered for specific patients.""We want to make sure they didn't make large batches of the drug and then ship them,"" Ohio pharmacy board spokesman Jesse Wimberly said.

The New York Times reports that one man in Los Angeles is willing to return it...for a small fee of $350,000. The photograph in question is a framed portrait of Mahler inscribed with a musical quotation from his renowned Symphony No. 2. It was given to Schoenberg by the older master himself in 1907 and was considered by the owner to be one of his most precious possessions, according to the Times. But somewhere along the line, between 1907 and today, the photograph went missing and ended up in the hands of L.A. resident Cliff Fraser. Fraser claims that the photograph was given to his grandfather by a composer in Schoenberg's circle years ago. This summer, he contacted the archivist at the Arnold Schoenberg Center via email to learn more about his grandpa's alleged gift, asking the Schoenbergs to help him ""understand its significance,"" according to a blog post written by Schoenberg's grandson, Randol. This is when the battle over the lost heirloom began, as Fraser offered to return the photograph to its original owners, as long they paid him $350,000 to do so. An image of the photograph sent to the Schoenberg Center by Fraser (courtesy of Ronal Schoenberg's blog, Schoenblog).The Schoenberg Center archivist, Therese Muxeneder, told Fraser that Mahler had probably given the photo to Schoenberg as a parting gift before the elder composer left for New York to conduct the Metropolitan Opera. After doing so, she alerted the family of the photograph's resurfacing, who then took over communication with Fraser in hopes of reclaiming the piece. But in a series of e-mails exchanged between Fraser and several Schoenbergs, the L.A. resident made it clear that the photograph was his property and that the payment of a hefty price tag was the family's only path to getting it back. The Schoenberg family maintains that the likelihood that Arnold voluntarily parted with the photograph, first discovered missing 25 years ago during an archival project at the University of Southern California, is slim. ""The photo was a treasured memento of a true friend. It was prominently displayed in my grandfather's study, so we are certain that he and my grandmother would never have willingly given it away or sold it,"" Randol stated in an e-mail to The Huffington Post. Beyond the photograph's significance as a family relic, Randol also points out the import of the work as an essential piece of modern music history and a reminder of the close relationship between two of the 20th century's most important composers. ""Mahler supported my grandfather artistically and financially at a crucial time in my grandfather's artistic development, as he made the transition away from orthodox tonal composition,"" he said in his e-mail. ""My grandfather adored Mahler, and staunchly defended him against his critics.""At present, the Schoenbergs are contemplating legal action and continue to raise awareness about the photograph's questionable provenance to prevent any auction house from brokering a sale. ""We are still reviewing our options with regard to what will happen next,"" said Randol. ""But of course we would very much like to see the photograph and the newer frame in order to determine if there are any other clues as to how it got to the Frasers.""Stay tuned for more information on this battle over the long-lost Mahler photo. In the meantime, let us know where you think the work belongs in the comments section.UPDATE: In an email exchange with The Huffington Post, Clifford Fraser stated that his family obtained the photograph in the 1905s, when Josef Schmid (a composer and member of the Schoenberg circle) gave the memento as a gift to Fraser's grandfather. Fraser, upon finding the photograph years later in his grandparent's home, contacted the Schoenberg Center in Vienna before later being approached by the family regarding a possible sale. He declined their offer, at which point Fraser claims the Schoenbergs ""pushed their claims that the photograph must have been improperly taken from their father's home.""Fraser has since spoken to experts at Princeton University and other local colleges who have verified that the musical inscription is actually Mahler's 3rd symphony -- not the 2nd, as the Schoenbergs had believed. When asked if Fraser has any plans on returning the photograph to the Schoenberg family, he responded, ""If the photograph was improperly taken from the Schoenbergs, I would gladly return it. However, the Schoenbergs have been unable to provide any such evidence to prove this. Their claim is filled with inconsistencies and they have resorted to using deception in an effort to trick me into giving them the photograph.""Though Fraser had no knowledge of Schoenberg or Mahler's music before his discovery, he stated that the photograph holds sentimental value now. ""Before making this amazing discovery, I knew very little about my grandfather's history. I am proud that my grandfather was affiliated with such great men as Schmid, Schoenberg, and Mahler."" With regards to his reluctance to initially speak with the press, Fraser stated, ""I was surprised by the sudden interest, and at the time, was in the middle of midterms."" He added that his father's previous statements do not reflect his family's position on the matter whatsoever."

After a series of rulings in Armstrong's favor in the UK courts, the two sides reached a settlement, the size of which was not disclosed. The newspaper also issued an apology to Armstrong.One senior source at the newspaper said that the case cost it about $1 million.There are precedents in the UK for the repayment of money won in libel suits. In one of the best-known instances, British novelist and former politician Jeffrey Archer paid back the damages he won in a libel case against the Daily Star newspaper. This followed his sentencing to four years jail in 2001 after being found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice in that libel case.In August, Armstrong announced that he would no longer contest charges brought by the anti-doping agency, which earlier this week released a report and documentation, including affidavits from former Armstrong teammates, accusing him of not only using performance enhancing drugs but imposing a ""doping culture"" on his team.Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Armstrong, said that he had no comment on the Sunday Times threat of legal action. Armstrong still emphatically denies doping, Fabiani said.Fabiani rejected speculation that, in light of the anti-doping agency's accusations, U.S. federal prosecutors might re-open a criminal investigation into a cycling team partly-owned by Armstrong, which was closed earlier this year.A reopening of the case was ""entirely implausible,"" Fabiani said. ""There is not a single thing in the USADA report that the US attorney did not have,"" he said."

But can the Gamecocks get it done in Death Valley? Meanwhile, Oklahoma and Texas meet in the annual Red River Rivalry in Dallas, and Stanford travels to South Bend for a physical battle with Notre Dame.So once again, dust off that grill and get it fired up because we’re starting this weekend’s tailgate.The marquee matchupsTexas vs. Oklahoma (in Dallas)  X-Factor: Landry Jones...If Oklahoma is to win this game, star quarterback Landry Jones has to exorcise some of the demons that have plagued him in recent big games. The Sooners lost some depth on the interior of their offensive line in preseason, but that unit showed last week against Texas Tech that it could be rounding into form. However, the Longhorns defense will pose quite a different test than the Red Raiders. If Jones has time to throw, he is one of the best in the nation. But if the 'Horns get pressure on him, he will be subpar as he was in the Sooners' loss to Kansas State a few weeks ago. The key for OU is employing a healthy dose of tailback Damien Williams, who has shown big-play ability this season and who is coming off of a strong game against Texas Tech. Keeping the ball on the ground and using Williams on screens will help negate some of that Texas pass rush and make things a little bit easier for Jones, who has a 137.2 passer rating in his last two games against Texas, completing 61.8 percent of his passes for 603 yards and 5 touchdowns against no interceptions as OU won both meetings.South Carolina at LSU  X-Factor: The Tigers' offensive line...LSU was dominated up front by the Florida defensive line last week in its anemic loss at The Swamp. While quarterback Zach Mettenberger didn't look great, he had almost zero help from his boys up front and his receiver corps. The Tigers are already without Chris Faulk and could be without left tackle Alex Hurst because of personal reasons. The senior Hurst moved from his right tackle spot after regular left tackle Faulk was lost for the season with a knee injury after the first game. Adding to the team's woes is the fact that right guard Josh Williford is questionable because of a head injury. So Les Miles and Co. have major depth issues across the line. And that could be problematic against a filthy Gamecocks defensive line, led by the freakish Jadeveon Clowney, who is second in the SEC with 6.5 sacks. But the Bayou Bengals will be salty coming off of their loss to Florida, and playing in the hostile nighttime environment of Baton Rouge will be a tough test for Steve Spurrier's team. I can't see the Tigers suffering back-to-back losses, but they have to find a way to keep Mettenberger upright and get their ground game to be productive against the Carolina front seven.Other games to keep an eye on  Stanford at Notre Dame: With wide receiver Ty Montgomery doubtful for this game, Josh Nunes will have an even tougher job moving the football against this Notre Dame defense. If Stepfan Taylor has trouble on the ground against the Irish front seven, then Bob Diaco's secondary will know that most of the passes will be thrown to tight ends Zach Ertz and Levine Toilolo. That duo will be a tough matchup for ND, but this Cardinal offense won't have any threat on the outside at receiver without Montgomery. Nunes is coming off of a strong game against Arizona last week, but a productive Taylor on the ground will be needed for this Cardinal offense to have a chance. Meanwhile, can Irish dual-threat signal-caller Everett Golson continue to grow after his improved play against Miami (FL)? This Cardinal defense, while subpar against Arizona, is still one of the nation's most physical groups.Iowa at Michigan State: With Ohio State being banished from postseason play, the Big Ten is looking for at least one team to carry the national baton into the postseason. While the Spartans already have two losses, including one in league play, they have a chance to get back into the Legends division race and hand the Hawkeyes their first conference loss. Andrew Maxwell and the Spartans offense must be able to build on the momentum from last week's second half against Indiana.USC at Washington: The Huskies have shown that they can rise to the occasion and beat a highly ranked team, as Steve Sarkisian's squad has already defeated Stanford. But the Huskies were also blown out against LSU and Oregon on the road. They'll get the Trojans at home, however, and Sarkisian has a 2-1 mark against his former school. Meanwhile, 'SC will look to continue to claw its way back up the national rankings and perhaps into the BCS title race.Don't forget about...

Your own unique collection of DNA contained in your genome is called a ""genotype."" Just as we each have a blood type, we also each have a genotype that has important, but more powerful bearing on our overall health and traits. Genomics, which you can learn more about here, is the study of our genotypes at the DNA level. Our genotypes also contain an enormous amount of information about our family trees. The goal of personal genomics is to mine the depths of our genotypes for nuggets of information that have great bearing, quite literally, on who we are, our health, and our family history going back thousands of years. A major, but not the only, player in this relatively new field of personal genomics is a 6-year-old company called 23andMe. Before shelling out $299 for this or a related service from another company, possible customers might ask themselves if it is worth it. From my experience, I believe it is not only worth it, but goes beyond money to see health and family history in a new way. Let me explain. Our genotype tells three main types of important stories about us, and the only way we can understand them is through personal genomics. Some of these stories are past tense, revealing the histories of our ancestors from whom we inherited all the parts of our DNA that collectively make up our genomes. Other stories are present tense in that they are about us, who we are and what diseases we have. Finally, a third type of story is future tense. These stories tell us about what might be. What might my kids be like? What diseases might I get? In my mind, information is power and information about our families and ourselves is all the more crucial for us to know.The very personal treasure trove of information in these DNA stories has for millennia been hidden from us -- ironically, tucked away right inside of us in each and every cell. Personal genomics of the kind that 23andMe conducts has the potential to reveal some of those hidden DNA stories, uncovering remarkable details about our past, present, and possible futures. Not surprisingly, a growing number of people want to learn the stories of their DNA and to understand what their genomes have to teach them. According to Catherine Afarian, Public Relations Manager, and Dr. Joanna Mountain, Senior Director of Research at 23andMe, who I interviewed for this article, in each year of its existence 23andMe has at least doubled their business. Over this short period of time, 23andMe has collectively analyzed the DNA of more than 150,000 people. What makes this an especially remarkable achievement is that the company, which has itself grown each year, now has only 80 employees. This team is roughly equally divided into three groups of biomedical scientists, engineers, and support staff.I took the plunge to see what 23andMe could teach me about my family and myself. Part of my motivation was that I am a genomics researcher myself, but in addition, I was curious if I could learn anything about a major health event in my life. I was diagnosed with a serious form of prostate cancer two years ago at the unusually young age of 42 (median diagnosis is at age 70). Could 23andMe shed any light on why this happened? I hoped so. You can read more about my experience with cancer in ""Do Vulcans get prostate cancer?"" and ""Should Men Get PSA tests? Yes, but...""I found the 23andMe experience illuminating in many ways, and every step was very easy. Once you place your order, they send you a small snap-cap tube, you spit into it, and then you mail it back to them. That's it. A few weeks later, you can go onto their website to start quite literally learning the stories that your DNA has to tell you. I think of it as a biography written in the letters of our DNA. In my case, my DNA, as translated into English for me by 23andMe, had many stories for me. The 23andMe website is very user-friendly and it divides the types of information from DNA into different categories such as diseases risk, traits, relatives, and so forth. Each area can be explored using its own handy tool.One of the foremost things on my mind when I got my 23andMe results back was whether there was anything in my genome that could answer the important question of why I got prostate cancer and at such a young age.Or more simply put ""Why me?"" Did my genome have an answer? I went to the 23andMe website for the very first time not realistically expecting a clear answer to the prostate cancer question. I know as a cancer biologist and genome researcher myself that almost nothing in biology is that black-and-white, but I looked at the results in the ""Disease Risk"" category with astonishment: Smack dab at the very top of the ""increased risk"" category for me was ""prostate cancer"" (see image above). I was surprised and impressed. Specific elements in my genome together pointed to my having an elevated risk of prostate cancer. Afarian and Mountain told me that my particular genotype put me in the top 10-20 percent of men in terms of prostate cancer risk. You might ask since I already have had prostate cancer, shouldn't my risk be 100 percent? And why only a seemingly modest 1.82x increased risk?When it comes to disease risks, genomics in most cases is not about certainties, but rather probabilities. In other words, just as the expression goes that anatomy is not destiny, so too is it true that genotype is almost always not destiny. Thus, 23andMe cannot tell for sure that you will or will not get a certain disease in most cases. Instead, it estimates risk, and in my case it said there existed a relatively very high risk for prostate cancer. Often, increased risks are not that impressive in a quantitative sense either. For example, it is not uncommon for risks to be less than 2.0-fold increased or decreased. These are still meaningful in an absolute sense, but how meaningful at an actual health level? It depends on circumstances. In the case of Stanford Genetics Professor Michael Snyder genomics studies told him he was strongly genetically predisposed to Type 2 diabetes, a disease he fairly rapidly came down with after his genome told him he was pretty likely to get it, but he was so rapidly diagnosed in part because the genome data made him and his doctors test him for blood sugar very frequently. In the case of prostate cancer, knowing one is in the top 10 percent risk group might make one more inclined to get PSA tests. Of course, in my unfortunate case, by the time I got my genomic data suggesting I was at high risk for prostate cancer, I had already had the cancer; but for many people the hope would be that genomics data could be obtained and be instructive before the disease manifests.Stayed tuned for parts two and three of this story in the coming weeks, where I go more into the relative finder and family history aspects of personal genomics, other personal genomics companies, and the future of the field including 23andMe.Disclosure: 23andMe gave me a free analysis of my genome at my request as I was researching this article on personal genomics. I have no professional/financial interest in or connection to the company.For more by Paul Knoepfler, click here.For more on personal health, click here."

More than 1.5 million older Americans already have lost their homes, with millions more at risk as the national housing crisis takes its toll on those who are among the worst positioned to weather the storm, a new AARP report says. Older African Americans and Hispanics are the hardest hit. ""The Great Recession has been brutal for many older Americans,"" said Debra Whitman, AARP's policy chief.

The housing market is beginning to show signs of recovery, but why isn't the mortgage market starting to bounce back as well?The answer lies within lending regulations, which have become much more stringent in recent years. Lenders are fearful of loan buy-backs (meaning they have to essentially 'buy back' any loan defaults) and thus has resulted in strict lending requirements for borrowers. Of course, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Finance Agency have their own standards, but lenders and loan originators abide by their own restricted set of qualifications in order to reduce the chance of having to buy back delinquent mortgages. In the Presidential debate on October 3, Republican nominee Mitt Romney brought up the qualified mortgage provision of the Dodd-Frank bill, which essentially forces lenders to pay stiff penalties if a borrower defaults on the loan and the lender failed to provide 'sufficient evidence' that the borrower had the ability to repay it. In theory, this seems like a reasonable regulation, but the issue at-hand is that the definition of a ""qualified mortgage"" has yet to be determined (delayed until January 2013). Because of the loose and incomplete definition, lenders are hesitant to lend to borrowers and investors are reluctant to invest, creating tight lending conditions and hampering a robust housing market recovery.To go one step further, regulators are also finalizing the definition of Qualified Residential Mortgage (QRM) which applies to all securitized loans and deals with the exception to the 5 percent risk retention requirement in Dodd-Frank. To clarify, lenders would need to retain up to 5 percent of the originated loan balance for loans that do not qualify as a QRM and consequently would increase rates for consumers to cover the costs. Loans that meet the QRM criteria would be considered exempt from risk retention. The criteria are still yet to be finalized by the six federal financial institution regulators.Regulations pertaining to the housing and lending industries are a necessity, but so are clearly defined standards and requirements. For a healthy housing market and a vibrant mortgage industry, we need regulations to resolve disputes between loan originators and regulators, encourage compliance for borrowers and lenders and provide stability to allow for secondary market investment."
