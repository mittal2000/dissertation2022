Given that Pakistan has already reportedly suffered 49,000 casualties -- including the loss of more than 15,000 security personnel in its fight against homegrown insurgency -- and given the prospects of full throttle action against the militants in coming days, the government needs to focus on formulating an effective strategy to avoid civilian casualties in future situations.

(AP Photo/Shakil Adil)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1386e230000330093cff8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When militants of the infamous Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) launched a brazen offensive on Pakistan's largest airport on April 8, I was frantically switching the TV channels in Karachi. I had heard there were missing employees and much later found out that their dead bodies were burned beyond recognition and recovered from a gutted cold storage area, where they had hid in a desperate attempt to save their own lives. The tragedy not only made me feel exposed to the threats being posed by the nation's lurking dangers, but it also made me realize that a large majority of the population shares the same apprehensions. A full scale military operation to rid Pakistan of the scourge of terrorism in the country's tribal belt has sparked a national debate, and defense analysts and experts on Afghan affairs and militancy have begun shedding light on the Karachi airport attack. Given that Pakistan has already reportedly suffered 49,000 casualties -- including the loss of more than 15,000 security personnel in its fight against homegrown insurgency -- and given the prospects of full throttle action against the militants in coming days, the government needs to focus on formulating an effective strategy to avoid civilian casualties in future situations.Keeping in mind our past experiences, we can say that any military offensive against battle-hardened local and foreign militants in the tribal belt near the Afghan border will most probably trigger a backlash across Pakistan through similar assaults targeting various high-profile sites. The government not only needs to strengthen its intelligence network to preempt such attacks, but it is also incumbent on the authorities to avoid collateral damage in its anti-militancy drive. Additionally, the government should make it a priority to save civilian lives in terror attacks in urban areas (Pakistan's top politicians like Imran Khan and other right wing politicians have repeatedly said that collateral damage due to the air strikes and the army's ground offensive in tribal areas has prompted militants to recruit the locals to take ""revenge"" from the state).Such moves on the government's part could not only win it the support of politicians opposed to the use of force against the insurgents, but the other sections of society will also feel safe and encouraged to stand up against terrorism.Instead of asking the government or other ministers to step down, we as a society should embrace the fact that the issue at hand has a far greater impact than a mere political blame game. It's afflicting the already limping economy, trade, international reputation, tourism, sports and all other facets that are vital for Pakistan's progress.Let's not forget the fact that it was only a month ago when we were slapped with travel restrictions by the World Health Organization due to the nation's failure to eradicate the crippling disease of polio -- mainly because of terrorism. Now, it's unclear whether the foreign investors and tourists will still be willing to travel to Pakistan in the current circumstances. Hence, it is high time to quell the insurgency through employing all the resources available. The incumbent Pakistani administration has dual responsibility in the context of the present security situation of the country. First, it should devise an effective strategy to minimize collateral damage in launching a counter-insurgency offensive in its northwestern tribal border and the war-ravaged Afghanistan. Secondly, it must prepare itself to respond to the challenging task of safeguarding the precious civilian lives in the event of a militant attack.This will not only have a positive impact on the Pakistani nation at large, but it will also make it more difficult for the TTP to bring more militants into its folds.Follow Madiha Shah Modi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MadihaModi"

The U.S. currently holds 149 men at Guantanamo. They include five prisoners charged with planning and aiding the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack who face trial by military commission, as well as a handful of others being prosecuted. Most have been held without charge since the government began taking prisoners suspected of links to al-Qaida and the Taliban at the Navy base on the southeastern edge of Cuba in January 2002. (AP Photo/Ben Fox)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cd082400003200577004.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans remain opposed to closing Gitmo. More accounts show David Brat worked to increase turnout among 'far right independents.' And Eric Cantor isn't the only GOP leader with low ratings from the Republican rank-and-file. This is HuffPollster for Friday, June 13, 2014.MOST OPPOSE CLOSING GUANTANAMO BAY - Justin McCarthy: ""Twenty-nine percent of Americans support closing the terrorist detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and moving its prisoners to U.S. prisons, while two in three (66%) oppose the idea. Despite the recent controversy surrounding the release of five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's release from Afghanistan, Americans' views have barely budged since 2009….Republicans remain more likely than Democrats to oppose closing the detention facility, although the majority of Democrats remain opposed."" [Gallup]ERIC CANTOR'S NOT THE ONLY GOP LEADER WITH LOW RATINGS NATIONALLY - Rachel Lienesch: ""Three days after Rep. Eric Cantor’s (R-Va.) stunning loss in the Republican primary in Virginia sent shockwaves through the U.S. Capitol, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds that Cantor is not the only GOP congressional leader struggling to find support from the party’s base. According to the poll, only about a third of Republicans have a favorable view of Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)....Also troubling for the GOP leaders is the fact that 45 percent of Republican respondents said GOP leadership in Congress is not conservative enough. Democratic respondents expressed much more positive views about their party’s congressional leaders."" [HuffPost]MOST AMERICANS DOUBT MIDTERMS WILL AFFECT ECONOMY - Mark Murray: ""Exactly half of Americans say that Democrats or Republicans in control of Congress won't make much of a difference in improving the economy, a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Annenberg Survey finds. That's compared with 25 percent who believe the economy will improve if Republicans control Congress, and another 23 percent who believe it will improve if Democrats are in charge. The survey also shows that 45 percent of voters say the economy and jobs will be most important in determining their vote in November -- followed by health care at 20 percent, education at 15 percent, foreign policy at 7 percent and the federal deficit at 6 percent."" [NBC]A new NBC/WSJ poll, but not the NBC/WSJ poll - The Wall Street Journal reports that the new poll ""is the first in a series...done by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News in collaboration with the Annenberg Public Policy Center, a research center at the University of Pennsylvania."" Via email, NBC's NBC's Mark Murray confirms that the new partnership is ""IN ADDITION TO"" their long-time collaboration with campaign pollsters Peter Hart (D) and Bill McInturff (R). ""In fact,"" Murray adds, ""it’s Peter Hart who is helping us with these Annenberg polls."" BRAT TARGETED NON-PRIMARY VOTERS, NOT DEMS - Sean Miller: ""House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s pollster is blaming thousands of Democratic voters for his client’s surprise primary loss on Tuesday but David Brat’s campaign didn’t spend any time targeting Democrats, at least according to one of Brat’s consultants. Steven Adler, a former Democratic consultant who was one of the inventors (along with Mark Sullivan) of the Voter Activation Network (VAN), was contracted by Brat’s campaign. Adler sold his half of the company, which has since merged with NGP, in 2005 and founded rVotes five years later. Adler says Brat’s campaign used rVotes to expand its universe beyond the traditional Virginia GOP primary voters being targeted by Rep. Eric Cantor’s campaign. Adler, who previously told C&E he as an apolitical 'computer guy' when VAN was founded, said several Tea Party campaigns had donated their data to Brat to allow him to expand his targeting universe."" [Campaigns & Elections]Work 'across party lines' helped target marginal Republicans- An account from a Democratic consultant Brian Umana, who helped provide guidance to anti-Cantor forces starting in 2010: ""[We] saw no harm in mentioning strategies that tea partiers might use to reach sporadic Republicans or far-right 'independents' who were less likely to support Cantor than other Republicans. We shared data-science techniques for voter targeting and for evaluating the relative cost of earning the votes of different types of voters."" [WashPost]A little more detail from McLaughlin - In the C&E report, Cantor's pollster John McLaughlin shared a little more detail about how he sampled likely voters for a much derided poll that showed Cantor leading by 34 percentage points two weeks before the election: ""Cantor’s pollster pointed the finger at an unexpected surge in primary turnout. 'We were polling a universe of people who voted in one of the last three Republican primaries and said that they were likely to vote in this Republican primary,' New York-based pollster John McLaughlin said in an email to C&E. He pointed to the increase in turnout from 46,000 two years ago to more than 65,000 on Tuesday. 'Untold story is who were the 19,000 new primary voters? They were probably not Republicans,' said McLaughlin."" [C&E]Evidence of Democratic votes for Brat weak - Sean Trende, who finds the suggestion that Democratic meddling led to Cantor's defeat ""highly unlikely,"" does an analysis comparing Cantor's precinct level vote to votes cast in the 2013 general election for Attorney General: ""First, there is evidence that Cantor really did do worse in heavily Democratic precincts. But the relationship is weak and doesn’t come close to explaining his loss. Moreover, we don’t know it was Democratic voting in these precincts that did Cantor in. It might be something about Republicans in these precincts that caused them to dislike Cantor more; in other words, we might have insufficient controls in place. Second, the second regression equation in particular is consistent with the “home style” hypothesis from yesterday. Cantor did well in the D.C. exurbs and in his old base in the City of Richmond. He did poorly in exurban Richmond counties, where he was less of a fixture. Regardless, while crossover Democratic votes might have hurt Cantor somewhat, they don’t appear to have been nearly numerous enough to have cost him his race."" [RCP]Another data point fails to support theory - Nate Cohn: ""I’ve not seen any evidence that there was a surge of 15,000 Democratic votes. Here’s one more data point: the change in turnout between the 2012 and 2014 Republican primaries, compared with the performance of Terry McAuliffe in his successful bid for governor of Virginia in November. Turnout increased in Republican precincts by about as much as it did in more Democratic precincts...so far, there just isn’t much evidence consistent with the theory that 15,000 Democrats — or a sixth of the people who voted for Mr. McAuliffe in November, or perhaps half of a normal Democratic primary electorate — decided to show up Tuesday. The simplest explanation is that there was a surge of conservative voters, and that they voted overwhelmingly to dismiss Mr. Cantor, who fared worse in the most Republican areas."" [NYTimes]TEN REPUBLICAN POLLSTERS RELEASE IMMIGRATION SURVEY - FWD.us: ""Using a collaborative effort among ten prominent Republican polling firms, FWD.us conducted two national surveys regarding immigration reform, one of 800 Hispanic registered voters, and the other of 800 registered voters, with an oversample to yield 505 Republican voters….Americans overwhelmingly believe the immigration system in the country is broken and that Congress should take immediate action to fix it. Republicans are more convinced than either Democrats or Independents that immediate action is necessary. Most Americans don’t believe 'deportation' is a viable policy with respect to undocumented immigrants. In fact, there is an overwhelming consensus in support of some kind of legalization for undocumented immigrants (either “legal status” or 'citizenship')."" [FWD.us]Anti-immigration Republicans hit back - Neil Munro: ""Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg rolled out 10 pollsters Wednesday to show that most GOP and Hispanic respondents agree with a carefully crafted pro-immigration proposal that included a barely-visible endorsement of the company’s primary lobbying goal….The script offered by the Zuckerberg poll to respondents downplayed the most unpopular elements of the immigration rewrite, such as the increased inflow of guest workers during a long period of high unemployment. The script also touted conditions — the need for illegals to learn English and pay taxes, for example — that supposedly would be attached to any amnesty for '11 million' people, but it didn’t show the public’s reaction if those conditions were not enforced."" [Daily Caller]Did you vote in the VA-7 primary? We want to hear from you -- drop us a note at pollster@huffingtonpost.com.WORDING ON NYPD POLL RAISES QUESTIONS - Matt Sledge: ""A Quinnipiac Poll released Thursday asked whether 'the [New York City] police should or should not restore the program where they patrolled public housing projects and asked people in the hallways for ID?' The poll found that 59 percent of respondents supported resuming such a program while 30 percent were against it….But there may be a problem with the poll's wording: The police department never said it terminated an ID-checking 'program,' and the implication that the police stopped checking people in public housing is undermined by the available statistics….Pat Smith of Rubinstein Associates, a public relations firm that represents Quinnipiac, defended the poll's wording. He said pollsters believed police officers are leery of asking people in public housing for ID after U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin'srulings last year against stop and frisk, as well as a law passed by the City Council last year that allows citizens to bring lawsuits over discriminatory stops."" [HuffPost]DRIVING WHILE DROWSY IS RELATIVELY COMMON - Emily Swanson: ""The sleep-deprived tractor-trailer driver charged in the weekend crash that killed comedian James McNair and badly injured actor Tracy Morgan and three others shed light on the perils of drowsy driving. According to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, though, drowsy driving is far from uncommon. In fact, 45 percent of Americans said they had at some point felt like they were so tired while driving that they might fall asleep at the wheel.""

A vote in the House is expected on the bill later this week. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cd092500008e013a5156.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The stunning upset defeat of House Majority Leader, Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) by Professor David Brat, an economist from Randolph-Macon College, in Tuesday's Republican primary has several takeaways for progressives besides envy and shame over why they do not directly take on the corporate Democrats.First, among all the reasons for Cantor's fall, there were the ones encapsulated in the nation's John Nichols' description of Brat as an ""anti-corporate conservative."" Repeatedly, Brat said he was for ""free enterprise"" but against ""crony capitalist programs that benefit the rich and powerful."" David Brat pointed out that Cantor and the Republican establishment have ""been paying way too much attention to Wall Street and not enough to Main Street.""Brat supported ""the end of bulk phone and email data collection by the NSA"" and other government agencies on constitutional grounds.Professor Brat attacked the Wall Street investment bankers who nearly ""broke the financial system,"" adding the applause line: ""these guys should have gone to jail. Instead of going to jail, where did they go? They went to Eric Cantor's Rolodex.""An advocate of ethical capitalism, with religious-Christian overtones, Mr. Brat went after the deal-making in Washington, such as Cantor's close relationships with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable. He especially berated Cantor for weakening the proposed bill to ban insider trading by members of Congress by exempting their family members and spouses.He chastised Cantor on immigration, taking advantage of the latter's wavering appeal to voters who believe that large corporations, represented by Cantor, want a never-ending supply of cheap foreign labor to hold wages down. On the other hand, Brat opposes a minimum wage on libertarian grounds.In addition, David Brat, described as a ""commanding orator who mixes fiery rhetoric with academic references and self-depreciating humor,"" wants a balanced-budget amendment, a ""fair or flat tax,"" and is opposed to federal educational programs such as ""No Child Left Behind.""Brat is a mixed bag for progressives. But in that mix is a clear populist challenge by Main Street against Wall Street and by ordinary people against the corporate government with subsidies and bailouts that the Left calls corporate welfare and the Right calls crony capitalism. Therein lies the potential for a winning majority alliance between Left and Right as my new book, Unstoppable: The Emerging Left-Right Alliance to Dismantle the Corporate State, relates in realistic detail.Second, Professor Brat spent about $230,000 to Eric Cantor's $5.7 million. However, David Brat more than made up for the money deficit with energy, focused barbs and the shoe-leather of his committed followers. On election night, Brat made the point that progressives would do well to heed, as they obsess over big money in politics; ""Dollars don't vote,"" he said, ""people do."" Interestingly, Tea Party forces and donors claim they thought Cantor was so unbeatable that they didn't even fund David Brat even though he had two national radio talk show hosts speaking well of him.Can't progressives find that kind of energy with their many broader issues and larger support base? Can't they find capable so-called ""nobodies"" with hidden talent to become publically heralded champions? There are fresh voices everywhere who can take on the corporate Democrats, like the Clintons, who work with Wall Streeters and espouse crony capitalism and with neocons to advance militarism abroad, along with corporate-managed, job destroying trade agreements and off-shore tax havens?Unfortunately the driving energy of progressives, including the dissipating Occupy Wall Street effort, is not showing up in the electoral arena. The political energy, the policy disputes and the competitive contests are among the Republicans, not the Democrats, observed the astute political commentator and former Clinton White House aide, Bill Curry.The third lesson from the decisive Cantor upset is not to embrace the political attitude that calls for settling, from the outset, for the least-of-the-worst choices. Progressives have expressed and harbored strong criticisms of the Democratic Party establishment and their adoption of corporatist policies, but election cycle after election cycle, fearful of the Republican bad guys, they signal to the Democrat incumbents that the least-of-the-worst is acceptable. Like the liberals they often consort with, progressives do not ask: ""Why not the best?"" with the plan that they will either win or at least pull their Party away from the relentless 24/7 grip of big-time corporatism.The final takeaway from this fascinating Virginian contest in the 7th Congressional District near Richmond was that Cantor's tactics backfired. The more Cantor spent on TV, radio, billboard ads and mailings, the more David Brat became known and the more people were reminded that Washington and Wall Street really do not care about people on Main Street.That is truly the nub of a Left-Right alliance. In recent decades, pollsters would sometimes pose a variation of the question: ""Do you believe that X candidate or Y party or Z in Washington cares about people like you?"" The responses revealed a sizable majority of people, regardless of their ideological or political labels, said ""no.""With the interest of the public, the community and the country in the forefront, those ""nos"" can become ""yeses"" for a long-overdue rejuvenated and just society driven by reality and edified by its ideals."

I never imagined the people, opportunities and experiences my blog would bring into my life. Fast forward three years to a phone call from my friend Lisa Heffernan, who writes at Grown and Flown:""The Katie Couric Show contacted me about a show on empty nesting, and I suggested they call you too.""One thing you should know about Lisa, her blogging partner Mary Dell Harrington and me -- we met online, and live on opposite ends of the country. These two women would never have become my friends and colleagues had it not been for blogging and social media. And so, the fact that Lisa so generously suggested that they call me is the ultimate example of how blogging has brought amazing things to me.From an ""unemployed"" stay-at-home-mom and empty-nester to The Katie Couric Show in three years -- and all because one day I decided to start a blog.Getting ready to be on The Katie Couric Show was a whirlwind of activity, starting Thursday morning when the producer called me, to Monday morning when they flew me to New York. I spent the weekend making my blog look as good as possible, shopping for the perfect thing to wear (which, of course, wound up being in my closet all along), and generally freaking out. I read the book by the psychotherapist who was on the show with us, and I thought -- a lot! -- about what I would say.I was told I would be sitting in the audience in the front row and answering questions from there, but the afternoon before the show I got a call telling me that there had been a change and now I was going to be on the panel instead.I had to find shoes.I had brought only flats, and from watching talk shows I knew that high heels were a must -- so much more flattering! I was with my friend Jennifer Wagner, another blogger I met through social media, when I got the call. Jennifer took me to Cole Haan to find high heels. Success!The day of the show I was nervous. I wanted to be sure to make intelligent comments and not stumble over my words. I still wasn't clear on how the show was going to go -- when I'd be on, what I'd be asked. When I arrived at the studio I was ushered to the Green Room, and there were Lisa, Mary Dell, and their blog photographer Theresa Kilman, another friend of mine. Lisa and I had our hair and makeup done, were led backstage, and then it started!The first part of the segment, during which I had to keep myself from tearing up during the video about Lisa's family -- didn't want to ruin my makeup!The amazing thing was that once I was on the set with Katie Couric -- who is as nice as you would think she'd be and made the whole experience easy and smooth -- I wasn't nervous at all. Sitting there and talking about a topic I know so much about -- empty nesting and reinventing yourself -- was surprisingly comfortable for me. Who'd of thought?When Katie said my husband is ""really cute,"" well -- that was the best.The second part of the segment when I joined the panel:Three years ago I was an empty-nester searching for my next great passion after raising my children.I knew there was something...something...out there, but I didn't know what it was. I gave blogging a try and it was the best decision I could have made. Social media and online connections have made all the difference in my life, and I can't emphasize enough how many opportunities there are to find a new direction as an empty-nester by looking to online communities, be it through Facebook, Google+, Pinterest or Twitter.There's so much out there to learn and understand, and it's exciting -- almost as exciting as being on The Katie Couric Show.

It took a week to convince me. Here's how it all went down:It was a cold, dreary November morning. Frost was beginning to settle on the windows, the dew covering the yard was turning to ice, and the hot water was steadily losing its battle against frozen pipes. I was a sophomore in high school and, like any similarly-aged young man, I wanted little to do with my parents, and especially nothing to do with their unmentionables. The events in question occurred one day when my father got the idea in his head that I needed to learn how to check for cancer. ""Self-checks are important,"" he began reciting as if from a book. When my dad gets an idea in his head that he wants to talk to you about, he never lets it go.The subject now was cancer. It came about honestly enough. My father spent 24 years in the federal prison system, first as a recreation supervisor, and then as a health and wellness teacher. He taught classes and certified inmates under the NFPT personal training system so that they'd have something to fall back on after they'd served their time. As part of the curriculum, he educated people on the warning signs and symptoms of testicular cancer. It was just part of the job at that point, before he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and I was diagnosed with melanoma -- before the disease had touched our lives. It took several days of nagging before I submitted to my father's wishes.I didn't want to have this discussion with my father. The traditional father-son talk had already been awkward enough. At this point, the subject matter was purely hypothetical anyway. I didn't think much about cancer at the time, and I damn well didn't think I'd ever be diagnosed with it. But, when dad gets an idea in his head, he can't be swayed. He was adamant about making sure I could identify the physical symptoms. He wanted to make sure I could do a self-check all on my own. So he whipped it out -- he reached in his pocket and pulled out his sack. Then he pulled out another. They were fake, wrinkly, rubbery sacks -- instructional tools used by educators to demonstrate what signs to look for. He held them out to me, one in each hand. I looked down at them, let out a deep sigh, and quickly looked down at the floor. But he forced me to take them. Then he taught me how to roll them around in my hands and told me exactly what to look for. As a teenager, very little is more embarrassing than running your fingers over a fake scrotum under the instruction of your father. But I did it, and before long I was glad that I had.At that point, cancer was still just a dirty word. Dad's parents, my grandparents, had both died of cancer, but it was a long time ago and it still felt very distant. I was very deep in a ""this could never happen to me, so I'm not going to feel your fake scrotum"" kind of mindset. When my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer, it suddenly became less hypothetical. I realized very quickly that people really did get cancer, even people close to you, people who never imagined that it could happen to them. And I began to feel grateful that I knew how to perform self-checks. Image credit: Squidbiscuit via deviantartWhen I found the mole on my leg, it wasn't a bump on my junk, but it certainly was abnormal. Since my grandfather had died of melanoma, my parents had always been hyper-vigilant about my skin. Through a combination of that prevailing sentiment and the knowledge I'd gained through learning about self-checks, I knew right away that this was something I had to address. The mole was elevated and had an odd coloring. I called home to make an appointment, and a cancer diagnosis shortly followed. The rest was a painful and traumatizing mess of terribleness, but hey, at least I'm alive. And if I hadn't been taught the importance of self-checks, I might not have caught this at all.I still consider myself extremely lucky. Because cancer is an illness, and it doesn't care how hard you fight, or what kind of war analogies you throw at it. It's going to kill you regardless, and that's scary. It's something a lot of people can't deal with, so they dress it up. I came out of it relatively well, physically. I'm missing the cluster of lymph nodes in my left upper thigh, and there's a pretty gnarly scar lining the inside of my calf. The only real damage was psychological, which I've worked through, and will continue to work through for the rest of my life.I want everyone to be as lucky as I was. I take that back; I want everyone to be even luckier than I was. If cancer is caught early, no matter what kind it is, the chances of remission are exponentially higher than if it's metastasized or been left to grow unchecked. It's okay to be embarrassed, but please, by all means, touch your dad's fake balls if he asks you to. It just might save your life some day.To learn how to perform a self-check, check out this helpful guide from the American Cancer Society.Originally published at CityMD Blog."

Tucked into the ""fiscal cliff"" tax package approved by Congress are billions of dollars in tax breaks, including a tax credit for the production of wind, solar and other renewable energy. (AP Photo/Orlin Wagner, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d2bb61260000132951dd8f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is a guest column from my colleague Dave Hamilton, director of clean energy for the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign.Believe it or not, there was a day when the Production Tax Credit for clean, renewable energy was not a partisan issue. When it cleared the House Ways and Means Committee in 1992, it was with a strong bipartisan majority. Then, clean energy was not perceived in Congress an us-versus-them issue. There was broad agreement on both sides of the aisle that developing new, cleaner energy industries would begin to level the playing field among energy sources and create more choices for consumers. It was described as good for the environment, the economy, and the nation as a whole. Members of both parties jockeyed to get projects and factories in their districts.Alas, those days are gone, even if the benefits are not. Now there is a crusading right-wing that is happy to take fossil fuel money hand over fist and be the spear tip for that industry's efforts to sabotage its growing clean energy competition. Most Republican members of Congress are now under great pressure from the big polluters who are their big money campaign donors to actively oppose clean energy industries that have been an agent of economic growth in the nation generally and in rural Republican districts specifically.Renewable energy is growing fast, fast enough to make some utilities, coal companies, oil and gas barons, (and some particular Koch brothers) pretty nervous about the future viability of their product.But to be realistic, the profits raked in by many of these billion-dollar companies have never been higher. Yet, the Kochs are using their so-called Americans for Prosperity front group and its dozens of affiliates to attack federal and state laws that have brought wind and solar energy forward from infancy to create tens of thousands of jobs and power millions of homes and businesses. Whether their target is state renewable portfolios standards, energy efficiency standards, net metering laws, or incentives like the PTC, the bottomless pockets of the Koch brothers are working overtime to obliterate clean energy.Even in 2012, the PTC benefited from a strong nucleus of support from House Republicans. But still, the credit expired again this past December 31. Today, because of the shade thrown on the wind industry by the fossil giants, more and more Republicans appear to be afraid to voice their support for the incentive even when there are serious megawatts or wind energy jobs in their very own district. Why face a reprimand from the Koch enforcers when you can just lay low, keep your head down, and weather the storm? What's the demise of a few small businesses and jobs in the district?Well, it's a lot. Clean energy means jobs. It means safer air and water. And it means less climate-disrupting carbon pollution pumped into our air. That's why the Sierra Club is kicking off its campaign to shine a light on a number of Representatives that have a wind industry presence in their districts and states, but apparently remain content to put those jobs and assets at risk with their silence on whether or not they support the renewal of the PTC. In some places, it's a handful of jobs in supply chain parts manufacturers, small but important cogs in a manufacturing industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs nationwide. In other areas, the economic footprint is enormous. Rep. Randy Neugebauer of Texas has more than 4300 megawatts of wind in his district with thousands of supply chain jobs and tax base that funds schools and community infrastructure. Yet those constituents don't seem to merit his support.Most of the members in question have not even weighed in on the Ways and Means tax reform proposal released by outgoing Chairman Dave Camp that would actually take money back from projects that have not yet run the course of eligibility for the credit. It's one thing to say that one is willing to kill the growth of one of the few manufacturing industries in the U.S. that has grown quickly since 2007, it's another to remain silent while the government yanks back resources that were promised in good faith to American companies and communities. Would the oil and gas industry allow that silence if the tables were turned?There has been plenty of opportunity to support the PTC since it expired on New Year's Eve. Conservative Rep. Steve King, with whom the Sierra Club disagrees more often than the alternative, circulated a letter with fellow Iowan Rep. Dave Loebsack arguing for a straight extension of the PTC through 2015. Every member of the House had the opportunity to sign that letter. But that's the least they should have done. If Congressional inaction threatens your district you can hold press conferences, make floor speeches, organize your colleagues - make a stink. But the silence has been deafening.Clean energy enjoys strong, broad, bipartisan support. It's time to make more citizens aware of what their elected representatives are actually doing -- or not doing -- to support it.If these members believe that the survival of wind jobs in their districts and states is not important enough to merit their support, what other industries and jobs do they think are expendable?"
10,LATINO VOICES,Don't Blame Central American Newspapers For Influx Of Undocumented Children,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/central-america-daca_n_5488329.html,,2014-06-12,"IXTEPEC, MEXICO - AUGUST 06: Central American immigrants arrive on top of a freight train for a stop on August 6, 2013 in Ixtepec, Mexico. Thousands of Central American migrants ride the trains, known as 'la bestia', or the beast, during their long and perilous journey north through Mexico to reach the United States border. Some of the immigrants are robbed and assaulted by gangs who control the train tops, while others fall asleep and tumble down, losing limbs or perishing under the wheels of the trains. Only a fraction of the immigrants who start the journey in Central America will traverse Mexico completely unscathed - and all this before illegally entering the United States and facing the considerable U.S. border security apparatus designed to track, detain and deport them. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae9de5250000320037d96f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new conservative talking point holds that Central American newspapers are inaccurately reporting on U.S. immigration policy, thereby creating a stampede of undocumented minors over the U.S.-Mexico border. But an examination of those newspapers shows the picture is more complicated than that.The number of unaccompanied minors apprehended while crossing illegally into the country has shot up from less than 7,000 in 2011 to an estimated 70,000 for the current year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services -- with most of them coming from Central America. Prominent conservatives, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), are blaming that surge on President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which allows many undocumented immigrants who arrived here as children to avoid deportation for a renewable two-year period.Critics say that DACA created the mistaken impression -- then repeated by Central American news media -- that minors who arrived in the U.S. illegally would be allowed to stay. In fact, only undocumented minors who arrived prior to June 2012, when the White House first announced DACA, are eligible for the program.The White House rejects the idea that rumors of lenient treatment for minors have spurred the wave of migration, saying the uptick in unaccompanied minors crossing the border illegally is instead a result of rampant violence and poverty in Central America. Nevertheless, the Obama administration is now urging Spanish-language media to make it clear that minors who illegally immigrate to the U.S. today won't be able to benefit. ""We have public messaging campaigns designed to educate and inform individuals about the dangers of crossing without the proper documents,"" a White House official told The Huffington Post in an email. ""We are also underscoring with Hispanic media both in the U.S. and in sending countries that recent migrants are not eligible for DACA or pending immigration legislation."" A Huffington Post review of Spanish-language and Latin American news reports found that while the region's newspapers often failed to emphasize the June 2012 cutoff date, they otherwise covered DACA accurately and included enough detail about the program to raise serious doubts that newly arrived migrants would be eligible.Moreover, HuffPost found, Central American news media routinely portray Obama as tough on immigration, instead of creating the sense that the administration welcomes the undocumented. Newspaper reporting from the region on DACA at the time the policy went into effect did not generally emphasize that those who entered after June of 2012 wouldn't benefit, though the reports often noted that applicants had to have lived continuously in the United States for five years.More recent reporting about DACA in the leading papers for the region do not, by and large, contain factual inaccuracies, but they also rarely mention that the program excludes those who arrived after the cutoff date. That omission is not unique to Latin American journalism. Associated Press reports translated into Spanish also routinely fail to mention the DACA cutoff date, as does more recent news writing on the subject in English. Much of the news in Central American papers about DACA wasn't even written by Central Americans reporters. Because the region has relatively few foreign correspondents in the United States, Central American papers often cover changes in immigration policy by filing the Associated Press's Spanish-language reports, along with other foreign wires, like Spain's EFE. At the same time, newspaper reporting in the region across the board has continued to cover Obama's record-setting pace of deportations, belying the view advanced by some conservatives that Central American media has portrayed the White House as lenient when it comes to illegal immigration. Carlos Arrazola, an editor at the Guatemalan digital news site Plaza Pública, cautioned against the idea that the spread of misinformation was prompting the mass migration of undocumented minors. ""I don't discard it entirely,"" Arrazola said of the theory, ""but I find it very difficult to believe."" ""Fundamentally, what's motivating the children to leave is to reunite with their parents,"" Arrazola added. ""They don't necessarily leave thinking that they'll be able to benefit from some law over there."" Some U.S. conservatives have criticized Central American papers for simply reporting the news about DACA.A recent article on the conservative website Newsmax, titled ""Central American Newspapers Tout Open U.S. Door For Illegal Minors,"" cited two articles appearing in the region's papers. The first article, which appeared in a Salvadoran newspaper last week but was actually written by the Spanish newswire EFE, reported on the two-year extension of DACA. The other article, attributed the staff of La Prensa, a Honduran daily, reported that the U.S. government would shelter some 500 undocumented minors from Central America at a military base north of Los Angeles. Both articles were factually accurate versions of news reports that had also appeared in the U.S. media. U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) referred to the two articles during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, citing them as evidence for his assertion that DACA has spurred the latest wave of illegal crossings by undocumented minors. Public officials in Guatemala are less convinced of Sessions' theory. Rafael Amado, the communications director for Guatemala's Ministry of Foreign Relations, dismissed the notion that minors were fleeing to the United States because of rumors that they would be allowed to stay there after crossing the border illegally. ""I don't think that perception exists,"" Amado told The Huffington Post. ""At least here in Guatemala, people don't know much about DACA. The kids that people are sending don't know about it."" Instead, Amado said, the common trait among most of the unaccompanied minors crossing illegally into the United States from his country is that they have a family member here. If the kids arrive thinking that by crossing into the United States they'll be allowed to stay, it's most likely because that's what their families have told them, Amado said. Human smugglers, known in Spanish as ""coyotes,"" have exploited that misconception, telling families that it will be easy for children and teenagers to simply cross the border and turn themselves in immediately to U.S. border authorities, according to Amado.U.S. policy requires border authorities to hand Central American minors over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement within 72 hours, rather than repatriating them immediately, as is the case for Mexican minors. Amado said the Guatemalan government will launch a campaign this week to urge adults not to send their children across. ""Here we've tried to clarify that you have to go through a process and it's not certain that you'll be able to stay [after crossing illegally],"" Amado said. ""And we're launching the campaign to let people know the risks and say, 'Look, don't go -- it's not so easy.'"" Elise Foley contributed reporting."

The US national football squad kicked off a 12-day training session in Sao Paulo on Tuesday as part of their 'dry run' for the upcoming World Cup. AFP PHOTO/Nelson ALMEIDA (Photo credit should read NELSON ALMEIDA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb757ee1f00002501250069.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an interview with the New York Times back in December, Jurgen Klinsmann, coach of the U.S. mens national soccer team (USMNT), said that the U.S. can't win the World Cup which begins today in Brazil. After the story came out, I was truly surprised that Klinsmann, even though he is German, would ever suggest such a thing to American fans. How dare anyone say we can't win before the matches even start? Sacrilege. He caught some heat for the statement, but I figured it was just a media training lapse. Then yesterday, he said it again! In my opinion, Klinsmann's attitude is emblematic of why soccer can't seem to catch on in the U.S.Now, before you brand me a fútbol hater (you know who you are), let me set the scene. I like soccer and the World Cup, just as I enjoy many other grand sporting events like the Indy 500, Wimbledon and the Olympics (I still don't get NASCAR). While it doesn't captivate me like American football, I do appreciate the athleticism and talent of soccer players. The fans are passionate, and aside from the drone of those vuvuzela horns and the practice of ending games with penalty kicks, I have few complaints. And I will watch the USMNT next week and hopefully well beyond.So, I'm not a soccer hater, but I think a few things need to change for U.S. fans to start embracing ""the beautiful game.""Stop Playing Not to LoseWhen I was a kid, my neighbors were an Italian family that loved soccer. While watching a game with them, Italy fell behind by two early goals and my neighbors were ready to slit their wrists. The remainder of the game was spent watching the leading team play keep-away as the Italians sulked.For Americans, nothing could be more boring. We are the country of long bombs, grand slams, hat tricks and tap outs. It's practically a cliché, but the lack of scoring and the tendency to protect slim leads is not good sporting theater in the U.S.And then there are the dreaded penalty kicks. Have you seen the size of a soccer goal? It's huge. And the goalie has to basically guess where the kicker will shoot. Teams play a long, strategic match which then comes down to a couple lucky lunges - or an unfortunate choke by a kicker. If I was in charge, I would bring back the ""Golden Goal."" Make the games pure sudden death, and I guarantee more Americans will take notice.America Needs Some StarsAside from his defeatist comments, Klinsmann also made news when he cut Landon Donovan, the best-known American player. I realize that the greatest players in the world today are not Americans. Europeans and South and Central Americans are beyond dominant, but we must have some good players to rally behind? While we shouldn't expect a dream team, somewhere along the line the promotional folks behind the USMNT should have introduced the casual fan to a few of our country's best players. Who is the Lebron James, Tom Brady or Mia Hamm of the USMNT? And if there's no superstar, who is the enigmatic oddball? Or the guy with a crazy haircut ... or supermodel girlfriend? That I can name at least one player for Brazil, Spain, Argentina and England yet none on the USMNT says more about the ineffectiveness of the team's promotional efforts than my apathy. Hopefully a star or two, who we can rally behind, will emerge in the next few weeks, otherwise the clock starts on NFL training camp.This is Our Year? Nein!Back to Klinsmann and bad karma. Yesterday he told the Associated Press: ""I think for us now, talking about winning a World Cup is just not realistic. If it is American or not, you can correct me."" Well it's not, and here we go:He may be right about our chances, but that is the last thing American fans want to hear. We always believe that we can win, particularly at the beginning of a sporting event. Last time I checked, all matches still start off with 0-0 score. The tournament hasn't begun yet, and anything can happen. In the U.S., we believe it is our birthright to be the underdog, and we always have a chance to win. We are a nation that cheers on the little guy, and we adore the Cinderella story. My gosh, has Klinsmann not seen Rocky? Or Hoosiers? Or Rudy?Suggesting that our team can't win is about as un-American as one could be. Bobby Knight would beat the crap out of Klinsmann for saying that. Vince Lombardi would pound him into the frozen tundra. Bill Belichick would cut him.How can you expect us to get on board with the USMNT when the coach doesn't even believe in them? If I had a chance to counsel Klinsmann on public relations for his team, I could limit it to three words: ""Know your audience.""My hope is that the USMNT will find a way to emerge from the ""Group of Death"" and play deep into the World Cup tournament. It will be wonderful if some new American stars are born, and hopefully many U.S. fans will fall in love with the game for years to come.You can keep the penalty kicks.Do you agree with Klinsmann or does the USMNT have a chance in the World Cup?"

For as long as I've known there was a Vietnam War, I've known that people leave objects at the Memorial. The first time I saw any of those mementos they were behind glass and professionally curated at the Smithsonian Museum of American History. But it wasn't like other exhibits. The bamboo cage covered in broken glass -- full size, but horrifyingly small -- wasn't a historical object, but a way of remembering and telling a story. Someone reaching out with his or her pain, hoping I would share it just a little. By the time I saw it, the decision had already been made to remember the war this way-- with a long, shiny black wall of names, and pieces of pain venerated behind glass. Differently from the way any other war is remembered in Washington, before or since.So when Washingtonian magazine assigned me the story of the man who keeps those objects, it was also an assignment to take a foregone conclusion of my childhood and figure out why and how it came to be.I had absorbed the cultural resistance to talking about the war. I knew there was tremendous anger, even still. I knew it wasn't a good idea to ask people about it. I knew that the stories were painful, and that this war in particular was difficult to talk about and difficult to hear about. I was, without really thinking about it, someone who didn't want to hear the stories, who was so far removed from them that it seemed better not to pry, not to ask for information. I assumed I would never really understand, and I protected myself by not really trying, not finding anything to take personally about the experience other people had had.The way I had learned about other wars, in history class and in movies, wasn't like those objects at all. History remembers great men; soldiers advancing, retreating, learning to kill and being killed, of maps turning from one color to another, of brotherhood and manhood, weapons, tactics and consequences. And I was never going to be a great man. The mementos, though -- well, they weren't exactly ""mementos,"" which are memories you keep. These things were memories you give away, memories you discard through sharing. These mementos created a fully democratic history of the war. Any person who can physically get to the wall to leave something behind is automatically a part of history and the way America memorializes the people we lost. Most objects are left with no identifying information or explanation attached. They allude to the larger history of war as it ever has been, not just the movement of troops but the people who miss each other, the prized and sparse material comforts, the reminders of home.The collection is massive, ungainly, impossible. They keep everything that won't rot. But the why and the how of America remembering this war becomes clear as soon as an object reaches in and grabs you by the heart. I never saw the boo-boo bunnies. They aren't on display anyplace. I only know about them because the day a man lifted them out of the box of things left at the wall, a reporter happened to be there. They were a pair of carefully, specially folded washcloths. Both folded the same way. The curator had no idea what to make of them. Fortunately, there happened to be a volunteer on hand who knew them immediately.Boo boo bunnies are for small injuries and wounds. They are washcloths meant to be wrapped around a piece of ice, to protect your scrape while Mommy numbs it. They are bunnies, which makes them nonthreatening even if the ice hurts a little. They are one of the powerful ways Mommy makes things okay when you're hurt.There's no way to prove who left the boo boo bunnies, and no way to prove for whom. But I know, deep in my bones, the story they tell. There was a brave Mommy. She had a little boy she loved very much. She made him into a good man. And she gave him up, gave him up to the world. One day, he got hurt very bad, and Mommy wasn't there. She didn't even know it was happening. He was hurt, and she wasn't there to make it okay. She kept the bunnies, though, for ten years or more after she heard he died. And one day she gave them up, too.Those bunnies tore through every layer of alienation from the war I had. Without any words at all. I knew their story, purely from the haphazard, illogical and utterly perfect way America remembers these dead. There was a very brave Mommy who gave up everything she had.

Hispanics, who tend to vote for Democrats, are poised to be the majority group in the state by 2030 under current trends.Davis, 51 gained national attention last year when she donned pink running shoes and spoke for 10 hours in a filibuster against new abortion restrictions. This week, she replaced her campaign manager in what analysts saw as a bid to energize a stagnant push for the governor's mansion.""Abbott remains strong and this, in a lot of ways, confirms the strategy that we've seen from his camp: Leave well enough alone,"" said Jim Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin and co-director of the UT/TT Poll. ""The Davis campaign seems to be not able to reverse the trend.""At its convention last week, the conservative Texas Republican Party turned further to the right, adopting a hard-line position backed by the Tea Party branch calling for a crackdown on illegal immigrants and calling homosexuality a threat to society.Analysts said the positions may solidify the party's base of older white voters in the November general election but could cause long-term damage as demographics shift and more Texas voters see the positions as out of touch with their concerns.The poll was conducted from May 30 to June 8 among 1,200 adults and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points.
