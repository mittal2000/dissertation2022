Protesters continue to gather outside the Balcombe plant in West Sussex in opposition to the controversial method of extracting energy out of the ground called 'fracking'. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb14067240000310096b724.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sarah YoungBALCOMBE, England, Aug 18 (Reuters) - British opposition to shale gas extraction flared up in the tiny village of Balcombe on Sunday as hundreds marched on an oil exploration site in protest at the drilling process known as 'fracking'.Banner-waving men, women and children travelled in by buses and bikes to join locals in a mile-long trek, surrounded by police, towards a drilling operation run by Cuadrilla Resources in the picturesque English county of West Sussex.Britain's government needs to win over a sceptical public if it is to stimulate a U.S.-style production boom and offset dwindling North Sea oil and gas reserves. The massive expansion of U.S. shale gas extraction has driven down energy prices and cut dependence on imports there.""I'd like the politicians to know that they have to be more careful and consult with communities more before they allow fracking,"" said 35-year-old Gabriel Schucan before the march.Groups orchestrating the protest said it would be followed by two days of ""direct action"" on Monday and Tuesday. Acting on police advice, Cuadrilla on Friday said it was suspending drilling due to the protests.""Direct action speeds up the national conversation a little bit. It forces us to talk about the things we don't want to talk about,"" said Ben Healey, a 39-year-old environmental consultant.Activists are concerned the hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, process used to extract gas from rocks underground can trigger small earthquakes and pollute water supplies. Other protesters oppose any oil and gas exploration in the countryside.Cuadrilla Resources, which is drilling a conventional oil well in Balcombe, is the only company to have fracked a shale gas well elsewhere in Britain, making its activities a target for protesters.Local campaigners and a group opposed to fracking, Frack Off, have been protesting at the site since drilling started in July. At one of two ""family friendly"" activist camps, a volunteer said they had been feeding up to 500 people per day. ENERGY SECURITYPrime Minister David Cameron has been unequivocal in his support for fracking as a way to create jobs and cut energy bills. Land in the north of the country is estimated to hold enough gas to meet Britain's needs for the next 40 years.But lawmakers in Cameron's Conservative party fear the push for more fracking could cost them votes in rural constituencies. A recent poll showed public opinion is split, with 40 percent of Britons against fracking in their area and the same proportion in favour.Cuadrilla Chairman John Browne, a former chief executive at British Petroleum, said fracking for shale oil and gas was important for Britain's energy security.""This is about getting domestic resources. Domestic gas is more green than imported gas, and we need to explore as much domestic resource as we can,"" said Lord Browne. ""It's right for our energy security, and, if done safely, we should pursue it.""With natural gas imports from outside the North Sea set to surpass domestic production by 2015 Britain has been looking for new gas sources to meet rising import needs. Imports have so far mostly come from Norway and, increasingly, Qatar, but Britain risks losing out to higher-paying Asian customers in the race to secure new supplies.Campaign group Friends of the Earth argues British shale production would not be significant enough on its own to cut energy bills across the EU-wide market, and rising global demand would soak up any extra production.

""You sing in your sleep.""Harris, 72, never stopped singing, and it gained her a place on the stage of history.Her rich soprano voice -- that voice -- became one of the sounds of the civil rights movement.Woke up this morning with my mindStayed on freedomHarris was one of the original four Freedom Singers of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee who traveled the country, performing mostly spiritually inspired songs at churches, rallies, college campuses and anywhere people in the movement were gathered. The others in the talented ensemble were Charles Neblett, Cordell Reagon and Bernice Johnson Reagon, who later founded the popular a capella group Sweet Honey in the Rock.The Freedom Singers performed at the 1963 March on Washington. Harris and Neblett will sing later this month at George Washington University during a celebration marking the 50th anniversary of the march. She will also perform at an interfaith celebration Aug. 28 in Washington.Cordell Reagon died several years ago. Bernice Johnson Reagon has occasionally performed with the group.In August 1963, the Freedom Singers were performing in California. Somehow -- and Harris doesn't remember the details -- they ended up on a plane headed to Washington with celebrities including Charlton Heston, Rita Moreno and Sidney Poitier.From the air, ""people looked like gnats,"" she said.""All you could see was people. You couldn't see no ground. Just people and the water in front of the (Lincoln Memorial). Just a sea of people. Different races. Different ages,"" Harris said. ""It just went all over me, and I was just happy to be in that number.""Harris thinks of it now as ""one of my greatest experiences, to be in front of all these people and to be in front of Dr. Martin Luther King (Jr.) and all the other civil rights leaders.""Looking back, ""I didn't know my voice would take me as far as it has,"" Harris said. ""It's a gift from the Lord and I use it for His glory.""The Freedom Singers at one point logged more than 50,000 miles in nine months, telling the story of the civil rights movement through rousing songs. Their main goal was to raise money and awareness for the movement. Some people say they raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, but Harris doesn't know.""I never counted the money,"" she said. ""I just kept it and turned it in.""But the music meant more than just money.""The music was the movement,"" said Andrew Young, a former mayor of Atlanta and a veteran civil rights leader. ""When we didn't have clear politics or the theology of social change and when there was no legal basis for social change, people sang 'And before I'd be a slave I'll be buried in a my grave; And go home to my Lord and be free.' They sang 'Keep your eyes on the prize and hold on.' It was people's means of expressing their hopes, their frustrations and their dreams simultaneously.""Some of the freedom songs were gospel songs or spirituals tweaked to reflect the movement. They also incorporated R&B and calypso.In Albany, where she came home to teach school for three decades, Harris is a bit of a celebrity. She is ""just one of the fiercest singers I've had the experience of singing with,"" Johnson Reagon said.Harris keeps of box of her ""I Am on the Battlefield"" CDs in the trunk of her silver 2003 Lincoln, and she is frequently on the road making appearances at churches and universities.She still lives in the same single-story house where she was born, the one her Baptist minister father built for his ever-expanding family of eight children.As a child, she was sheltered. She didn't know she couldn't eat in certain Albany restaurants or had to use the stairs to enter the movie theater.""At the time, I thought I was free because my dad kept us from all of that stuff,"" she said. ""He said, 'I built this house for you, so you don't have to go to a hotel. I buy the food, so you don't have to go to a restaurant.' ""So she was shocked when she was stopped on an Albany street by a volunteer registering people to vote who asked whether she wanted to be free.""I told him I was already free,"" Harris said. He convinced her otherwise, and soon she was registering people to vote.She remembers teaching a 90-year-old African-American man to write his name, so when he registered to vote, he wouldn't have to sign with an ""X."" She calls that period her ""awakening.""Leaders in the civil rights movement soon recognized Harris' voice was invaluable.When folk singer Pete Seeger heard the Freedom Singers in Albany ""he knew it was something special,"" said Candie Carawan, a singer, author and activist. ""The power of their voices, and the message in the songs really conveyed what was happening in the South.""Harris had a few perilous moments while working in the movement. Once, in Alabama, someone shot at the car carrying the singers.""You talk about some prayers being sent up,"" Harris said. ""But we got through that and no one was harmed.""She also was arrested three times during marches in Albany, and she spent a total of 14 days in jail.But Harris said nothing scared her.""My dad taught us never to be afraid of anything or anyone,"" she said. ""I got my freedom myself, and no one did it for me.""------More on the music:NPR takes a look at songs inspired by the civil rights movement:www.npr.org/2013/07/09/199105070/the-mix-songs-inspired-by-the-civil-rights-movement ___(c)2013 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (Atlanta, Ga.)Visit The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (Atlanta, Ga.) at www.ajc.comDistributed by MCT Information Services"

(Photo by Mark Von Holden/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafb9b82100006401c701a2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the months since the memoir of our 50 years together, Double Life: A Love Story, was published, Norman Sunshine and I have received many extraordinary letters. In addition to the positive comments about the book, people have written us about their own lives. We learned about a gay brother who committed suicide because he was rejected by his family, and we heard from the wife of a blue-collar worker who was inspired to persuade her husband to go back to his original love of art thanks to what Norman had written of his own struggles as an artist. Gay couples wrote us that after the description of our wedding, they had decided to marry, and many gays shared their own stories of love and commitment. An editor in the publishing world with many famous authors to his credit told us that they all received letters from fans, but those letters were never as personally revealing as the ones we received were. We did get a few critical comments: Some wanted less about Hollywood and more about our love story, and others wanted less about our love story and more about Hollywood. One particular letter has always stuck in my head: It complained that ""we led such a charmed life, so what's the big deal?"" I thought a long time about that. Yes, we had been very fortunate: We were still together after so many years, we had had some success (which we had worked very hard for), and now had the wherewithal to spend our late years in a small town of great beauty and welcoming neighbors. We had not written in our book about any of our illnesses, about my losing my hearing in one ear through the negligence of an emergency-room doctor, about my nearly drowning at the Barrier Reef, or about other bouts with what we all experience as human beings who are destined to one day meet the end a life that begins with birth. But still we had a ""charmed"" life, and that's what we wanted to write about, hoping to show the happiness that we had gained from love and a long-time relationship. And then came cancer. So much for a charmed life. I'm not going to go into the process that we've all read about many times. Norman discovered a lump, which was removed and found to be non-Hodgkins lymphoma. We went to Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and had all sorts of tests, and the treatment was prescribed. The chemotherapy was administered in our small town by a brilliant oncologist and an equally talented nurse and is now finished. A few days ago a PET scan revealed that Norman is totally clear of any disease and will just have to have some radiation to finish it all off. The real story is Norman's (and every other cancer patient's) courage and ability to stay positive and optimistic. Norman had no pain but terrible bouts of fatigue and depression, as well as mood changes that were so frequent that I often didn't know which of the many people he became I was dealing with.The good news, besides the cure, is that I was able to be with him every minute and be part of every decision. Since we live in Connecticut, a state that recognizes our marriage, I didn't have to fight to prove that Norman and I were a couple or wave a power of attorney in everyone's face before I was allowed to be at his side at all times. As a spouse, I was at every meeting with the doctors in Connecticut, as well as in New York, which is also a marriage equality state. I was able to sit with Norman for the seven or eight hours that is chemo, ready to help if he needed me. Of course, the nurse was always there, so he didn't, but at least I could pull up a blanket or get him some tea, just a gesture to keep him from feeling alone.I was there, a few inches away, when they drilled into his bone to see if the cancer had spread. I reached out for his hand in case there was pain. Fortunately there wasn't, but I was there anyway. No one questioned my being with Norman, and I was treated as any husband or wife would have been. Since the Supreme Court decision, I have had a new feeling of being truly married, and now I can even use the word ""husband,"" which had always stuck in my throat before. Norman and I got married in Massachusetts in 2004, but it is only since the defeat of DOMA by the Supreme Court that I have begun to realize what marriage truly means. We can put our money together now, and when one of us goes, the other won't have to prove to the government that he was the one who paid for the dishes or the kitchen chairs. And then there's the realization that when the chips are down and it's a matter of life and death, we will be treated as a married couple in every sense of the words. So will the other married couples who live in the 13 states that recognize marriage equality. Isn't it coincidental that our country began as 13 colonies and grew to be the great nation it is today? Let us hope that just as those 13 colonies spread to become 50 states, marriage equality will do the same, and couples like us who have to face serious issues will be able to do so out in the open, with everyone helping them, and with the respect and acceptance that we were so fortunate to have."

Gaga then clarified the process, saying that while an IT firm will track the data, creativity counts as well.Gaga's contest was launched just a few days before it was revealed that Katy Perry's ""Roar"" is expected to surpass sales figures for ""Applause,"" but it seems unlikely the singer's efforts will be enough to top Perry.

I've never done that mainly because, for the fans and for me, each time I've gone around there’s been a really good reason to do it and I don't know what that reason is from here. I’m in the middle of making this and I just promoted the other and I'm really happy with the way 'The Wolverine' came out.”As expected, ""The Wolverine"" has been a lucrative entry in the ""X-Men"" series, so it makes sense that Marvel Entertainment would want to extend its shelf life. The movie took in $53 million during its opening weekend and has accrued more than $116 million domestically to date. Jackman has already begun filming the seventh ""X-Men"" edition, entitled ""Days of Future Past,"" which is due in theaters in May 2014. But it looks like the Wolverine may put his claws away after ""Days"" tears its way into theaters -- at least for now. The actor's schedule does seem like it would permit more superhero work, however, should he choose to go that route. The only other incomplete project currently on Jackman's radar is the part of P.T.

The whirlwind of commentary, PR noise, talent additions, analyst projections, competitor banter, and distribution talks have led us to this exciting moment in sports media history. A while back I wrote some thoughts on the high expectations that await FS1 and FS2's pending launch. How will things go from here? Who the hell knows. If I had to guess, I'd say things will be smooth on the live events front but to expect a very bumpy road on the original programming front. Basically a similar story as NBCSN, albeit with the benefit of a larger portfolio of live programming to get out of the gate a bit faster.As you keep tabs on FS1's rookie year, here are some things to keep a close eye on going forward. These are 10 questions for Fox Sports...1) Can Fox Sports Live Get Significant Traction?A little over a month ago, I penned an article in which I basically kicked SportsCenter in the nuts. I kicked field goals and punted in high school so it was a painful kick, one that brought a ton of comments and social shares of people sharing the same sentiment.A couple weeks back ESPN aired a countdown of their top ""This Is SportsCenter"" commercials. I watched the entire thing nostalgic for SportsCenter in its prime and kept thinking ""more like This was SportsCenter.""SportsCenter is a habit for many. The product has gone downhill, but it's still where many of us turn although there is a growing trend of fans turning towards league owned networks for highlights or shows like PTI to get their daily fill of sports.Enter Fox Sports Live and what many conclude was a shrewd hire in bringing in two goofy Canadians to lead the charge. But two shrewd hires alone won't put a dent in SportsCenter's ratings. Production quality, chemistry of other unproven on air talent (Andy Roddick, Gary Payton, Donovan McNabb), general set and graphic anesthetics, and quality of features and segments will all be key. Fox Sports Live will certainly not be a clone of SportsCenter and where they differentiate will be very interesting. At the end of the day it could be like a refreshing cold gallon of water for sports fans wandering the barren sports media landscape or it could end up being something you spit out realizing it's gone bad.If Fox Sports Live can get any significant traction (regular low to mid six figure audience), then the network will be off to a great start.2) How Much Mileage Can Fox Get Out Of The UFC?Rewind to 2008/2009 and there was a bit of a building intrigue on just how big MMA could get? Would it challenge some of the pro leagues in terms of popularity? Unloved by ESPN and winding down a relationship with Spike, Fox made a splash by partnering with the UFC. It was a bold move, one that probably accelerated internal enthusiasm for Fox to launch an all sports channel.But of late the popularity of the UFC has seemed to plateau. Ratings and pay per view buys have zigged and zagged but for the most part the core metrics have shown a decline of viewership and interest in the sport which you can probably attribute to a lack of any ""super fights.""Fox certainly has been clear they'd like to target the younger male demo and that's where the UFC's strength is. Still though, the UFC seems to be facing a familiar problem for many sports where it's seen as niche and faces too much friction to become mainstream. Fox aims to get increasing mileage out of the UFC in the years to come and I've even heard some rumors that the UFC could be interested in selling to Fox at some point during this current partnership.Similar to the NHL on NBCSN, a huge part of Fox's success going forward is going to be tied on just how much they can grow general interest in MMA. Better armed now with a pair of sports networks, it's certainly something to keep an eye on going forward.3) What Other Talent Will Fox Add To The Fold? If ESPN is never done adding and tweaking their talent, then obviously Fox will be almost equally as active. Who, when, from where, and for what will be critical.More former athletes? Wild card hires like Clay Travis?Up and comers from ESPN and beyond? Paying big bucks for established talent?Kenny Mayne? (Personal favorite of mine who I never see)That's just on air talent. I'm confident across the board at Fox Sports (Digital, Production, ad sales, executives, etc), they need to keep adding talent to keep the train moving.Fox has the challenge of building a relationship with viewers almost from scratch and will require more personalities to do so. With that in mind, they'll have to be different yet not rub people the wrong way. Quite the challenge, almost like infiltrating a new group of long time friends. Not easy at all.4) Will The Regis Hire Work?The hiring of Regis Philbin and making him the center of a new show is probably the move that raised the most eyebrows from observers. The basic gist is that Fox aims to skew younger than ESPN and then one of the few big original content bets they're making is on the shoulders of 81 (a week away from 82) year old Regis who hasn't been on television for a year and hasn't dabbled in sports much at all.Will this work? I like the name of the show and some of the auxiliary hires. To some degree, I see it working. Regis is entertaining. You can't hate him no matter what he says. He's all over the place but affable. But at the same time, will sports fans really watch this? Also Philbin hasn't been too smooth on the PR blitz as he's seemed aloof to some of the more specific details of the Crowd Goes Wild such as who are the others hosts and the show's premier date. I'll certainly tune in a couple of times to get a feel for what the show is and I'm sure many others will given how odd of a move this is. But after the initial intrigue wears off, will there be enough of a regular audience to keep the show as a signature program for the network? 5) Were Distribution Concessions The Right Move?FS1 WILL launch in 90 million homes.Will FS1 launch in 90 million homes?FS1 WILL LAUNCH IN 90 MILLION HOMES! Those were the headlines on the distribution front over the past couple of months, the last one being what many thought was a ""THAT JUST HAPPENED"" moment as it was reported that FS1 used some type of voo doo sorcery to compel Time Warner, Dish, and DirecTV to carry the channel at what was presumed to be a ~3x fold increase of the soon to be defunct Speed channel. These three ""deals"" got FS1 over the stated 90 million household threshold as they were nearing launch with only half that number signed on. The presumption was that not only was Fox going to get that added revenue (to the tune of $20-$30 million a month), but that the deals would scale out over time and that FS1 would see annual increases in addition to solving distribution issues with FS2 and FXX. But word leaked that Time Warner, Dish, DirecTV didn't actually give in. While it's not technically collusion, often many of the big cable/sat companies unite to essentially get added leverage in these type of negotiations for new channels. If you do a deal before you really need to, you're basically a scab. Three of the Big Four (Comcast not included) didn't blink and with the launch nearing and all of their launch PR efforts in danger of blowing up in their face, Fox conceded it wasn't going to happen and opted to fight another day and essentially opted to honor their legacy Speed contracts at at much lower carriage rate.Again doing the math this could be a $200-$300 million annual blow. Not good at all. Could they have dug their heels in and negotiated better deals at some point in the coming months? Maybe, but that would have really soured the perception of the network.Fox is now betting that they can enter into new deals as the old Speed ones expire and it's possible to some degree they can make up what they are losing in the next year or so on the backend of future extensions. Any deal Fox would enter into now was probably going to be a compromise between Fox's desired carriage fees and what Speed currently gets. By bypassing negotiating now, it's possible although probably unlikely that FS1 can really get out of the gate quickly, build a sizable loyal audience, and then have a lot more leverage in negotiations when they get another crack at it.Essentially giving in now puts more pressure on the network to perform in the short term.6) Is Fox Done Adding Marquee Live Programming?The answer here is probably yes given there just aren't many sports rights up for grab in the years to come. The NBA is highly probable to stay with Turner and ESPN. After that the B1G Ten could be in play but that's a couple years away. Big time events are crucial for any sports network but given the lack of rights up for grabs and the fact that Fox's spending war chest just took a pretty substantial hit with the inability to get new carriage deals done, it will be quite the surprise if Fox could bring home any other major rights packages that would alter the trajectory of the network early on.7) Can FoxSports.com Build A New Identity?What is FoxSports.com? I've heard both readers and Fox employees wonder this. Piggybacking off of a traffic partnership with MSN as well as the acquisition of Yardbarker, Fox Sports Digital is a major player online but it doesn't have a defined identity. Like many online sports portals it seems along the way they fell into the habit of imitating the look and feel of ESPN.com. Change is in the air though as my former boss at Yardbarker, Pete Vlastelica, is overseeing a bevy of new initiatives across design, technology, and content. Additionally the site's most prominent columnist, Jason Whitlock is apparently on his way out and another columnist was just tabbed by Deadspin as the worst columnist in America. A television network, new management, new hires, new acquisitions, and new enthusiasm all open the door for FoxSports.com to become something, but time will tell what if anything that something is and how it will differentiate from a very competitive and crowded sports portal space. Fox will certainly be pushing video as a priority and has signaled their moving to more fun blog content and away from news. Will all of the changes successfully differentiate Foxsports.com among its peers and can the influx of video content and new personalities bring new visitors to the site? It's something to keep an eye on given the strong symbiotic relationship ESPN programming and ESPN.com have built over the years.8) Will A Retooled Fox College Saturday Put A Dent In ESPN's College Football Monolopy?It didn't take long for me to hit the eject button on watching Fox's college studio show last year. I was interested in giving it a look given the pairing of Lou Holtz and Mark May drowns out all of the positive elements Rece Davis brings to the table. The first week the show was set to debut, extra innings baseball nixed the entire show. The second week of the season almost suffered the same fate but eventually when the curtain finally came up, it was a total disaster. I still have a Word doc of compiled tweets from that inaugural effort and it's painful to look at. Somehow despite their being no other personality that I despise more than Mark May, I was back to being a regular viewer back over at ESPN.Fox isn't going away though. In fact they've doubled down. More airtime, new personalities including the controversial Clay Travis, and new time slots. ESPN's College Gameday is still the gold standard for pregame shows and ingrained into the culture of college football. Fox thinks they can carve out an audience regardless and also has their eyes on the afternoon and evening highlights focused hours which ESPN dominates as well. This will be an uphill climb, but one Fox is committed to doing. This will be another key barometer to FS1's overall success.9) Will FS1 Develop Any Documentary Series?30 For 30. Hard Knocks. 24/7. Those brands ring out, generate buzz, and bring in solid ratings. I even suggested that it would be smart for FS1 to try to grab the rights to Hard Knocks given the built in audience the show has for the pure purpose of getting people familiar with the network and channel number (HBO recently reached an extension with NFL Films).Currently documentaries don't seem to be a part of the FS1 playbook but will that change given the positive implications they often have for media brands regardless of the fact they are content loss leaders (meaning they often lose money). But will Fox begin to reinforce some of the live event programming they have with documentaries? Peter Berg wanted to do a documentary series on Washington State football. No channel picked it up but would FS1 be open to it now given they have programming hours to fill and a long term agreement with the Pac 12? Would FS1 look to partner with NFL Films similar to NBCSN's partnership overseeing the production of Turning Point? Would they look to expand on Fox Soccer's Being: Liverpool series and launch a fresh documentary brand that way?Some of this is wishful thinking but given the success HBO, ESPN, NFL Network and to a smaller degree NBCSN has had here, I don't think it's crazy to think FS1 will at least give the idea a hard look as they look to get on the radar with more sports fans.10) How Nimble Will Management Be?In a recent interview with Variety, I came away fairly impressed with the perspective and context that Fox Sports Media COO Eric Shanks shared on the launch and expectations. Some choice quotes:""You hope (viewers) stick around a little bit longer for your news, if they like it. And then all of a sudden, maybe they start to remember your channel number.”“Shit’s gonna go wrong. I’m prepared for shit to go wrong. People are going to critique. That’s just the nature of the beast.""“But you learn that you’re going to take it all in, and you’re going to listen to your talent (and) your producers. You’re going to listen to fans, to your own gut, and you’re going to make changes. But we are going to be very patient.”Shit is definitely going to go wrong. I have no doubt as well. The million dollar question is just how quickly FS1 can improve in areas they fall short. How long of a leash will shows, personalties, and initiatives have if they under perform? Is FS1 content to make small tweaks and hope that in a decade they've begun to close the gap on ESPN? Or will they try to ""win often and lose quickly"" making big changes swiftly as they see needed?Shanks hinted towards patience. If ratings and critical reception don't live up to expectations, it will be interesting to see how much patience will be extended.All in all, a lot of questions to what should be a memorable rookie campaign set to unfold in less than 24 hours."

After successful completion of the course of their choice, guests will receive a certificate of achievement and a donation will be made to a local charity on their behalf by Peter Island. 3. Snorkeling here is a must. Also try your hand at an array of other watersports such as sailing, windsurfing, kayaking and paddleboarding. In addition, Peter Island boasts beautiful hiking and biking trails, basketball and tennis courts and complimentary yoga in the Tranquility Garden. Take the 5-mile walk across the island in the mornings; it's uphill at first, but the path levels out and is worth the amazing views to start your day.4. Head to White Bay Beach for an afternoon of pure relaxation and snorkeling. You'll have a box lunch (and whatever else your heart desires) awaiting. When I visited, I was the lone person on the beach. It's as close to Honeymoon Beach as one can get. 5. From 5 to 6:30 p.m. everyday, catch a true BVI sunset from the most beautiful point on Peter Island: Sunset Loop. The staff drops off a fruit-and-cheese platter and your favorite beverage, and then leaves you there to watch the sun dip below the Caribbean. It's true heaven. "
