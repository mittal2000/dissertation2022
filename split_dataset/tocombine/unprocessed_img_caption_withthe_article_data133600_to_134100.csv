0,FOOD & DRINK,"Cooking Off the Cuff: For Variety's Sake, Roast Some Of This And Some Of That","Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-for_us_5b9dbcd8e4b03a1dcc8c3f27,"I seasoned everything - more salt and pepper, plus thyme (rosemary or sage would have been other options) - and put the pan",2013-12-25,"A duck leg, a slice of pork belly and salt and pepper: the makings of a mixed roast dinner",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dbcd62000003000fe1489.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"A common feature of festive tables is a big roast. A sofa-sized turkey; a pillow-sized capon; a rib of beef too huge to fit into your largest roasting pan. Imposing, delicious and, dare I say it smack in the middle of the holiday season, monochromatic. Along about the third helping of roast pork leg, some people may get a hankering for something - anything - else. But they're generally out of luck.In northern Italy, in the shadow of the better-known bollito misto (which offers platters or carts laden with three, four, five, a dozen different simmered cuts from beef brisket to capon to calf's head), you sometimes see its roasted counterpart, the arrosto misto. With its built-in variety, it is a certain cure for gastronomic boredom (even if some would criticize it as an unfocused miscellany). Of course, in a restaurant specializing in such things, each roast will indeed be gigantic, but at home, with careful shopping, a miniature version is easy to put together and even easier to cook. To retain the spirit and simplicity of this one-pan dish, think of meats that will be tender when roasted but that have enough fat and connective tissue to remain moist when left alone in the oven to cook until well-done. Lamb shoulder? Pork butt? Poultry legs? Breast of lamb (possibly boned and rolled)? Veal shank? And do spend a few moments considering whether your selection will somehow create havoc on the plate.For just a few people, you don't need too much diversity, just enough to make it fun. Here's the one Jackie and I had a couple of days ago: a big moulard duck leg and a nice chunk of skin-on pork belly, both raised by favorite farmers' market vendors. The two meats differ but don't clash, and they taste delicious cooked well-done (as opposed to duck breast, which suffers when overcooked). I salted and peppered the meat a few hours before cooking, then patted it dry and browned it lightly, skin-side down, in a shallow roasting pan over medium-low heat. This started the fat running, which was crucial for the next step: I added chunks of potato to the pan - surrounding, not underneath the meat, the idea being that they would roast and brown, not get smothered under the duck and pork. What I did slip under the meats (now skin-side up) was a big carrot cut into 3/8-inch slices; it acted as an edible roasting rack. I seasoned everything - more salt and pepper, plus thyme (rosemary or sage would have been other options) - and put the pan into an oven pre-heated to somewhere between 375 and 400 degrees F (190-200 C), where I left it alone for two hours. Well, almost alone: every half hour or so, I turned the potatoes and marveled at how nice everything was looking and smelling.The result was crisp, deep broun skin on both the pork and the duck, with sufficiently tender, still-unctuous, exceedingly flavorful flesh beneath it. The potatoes could be described in the same way, and the carrots were almost confit after their two hours under the roasting meat: slightly chewy and intensely flavorful. (The carrots might have been the best part of this dinner, but then I often think that of carrots, which I adore.)It also looked great when transferred to a more presentable dish, leaving the fat behind in the roasting pan. If we had had a dining room full of guests, an expanded version of the same dish (figure half a duck leg and a chunk or two of pork per person) would have been an impressive thing to bring to the table. And no one would have staggered home whispering to his partner, ""Oof, if I never see another leg of lamb it'll be too soon."""

Many credit the Brothers Grimm and the publication of their fairy tale Hansel and Gretel for popularizing the pastime of crafting candy-crusted gingerbread homes (or just buying really cool already decorated varieties like these 7 Gingerbread Houses to Buy). German settlers ultimately brought the tradition to the U.S., where gingerbread houses come in all shapes and sizes; some more over-the-top than others.In the past two decades, hotels, casinos, and theme parks have magnified the basic do-it-yourself gingerbread homes into grandiose gingerbread displays. From a 17-foot gingerbread ship docked at The Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island in Florida to a life-size gingerbread house at Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Conn., to a life-size gingerbread carousel at Disney's Yacht and Beach Club Resorts, The Daily Meal has found the 12 most outrageous gingerbread displays of 2013.These edible creations are so irresistible that we won't blame you if you sneak a bite as well as a peek.-Lauren Mack, The Daily MealMore Content from The Daily Meal:10 Coolest Cookie Cutter Sets15 Outrageous Gingerbread Houses"

But everyone does it. It's as natural as breathing, and just as much of an involuntary activity -- even people who don't remember dreaming actually do, for at least one to two hours every night. Early observations of sleeping infants led to sleep studies with adults, and the subsequent literature about rapid eye movement, or REM, became the foundation for laboratory-based dream studies (1). REM is the sleep period considered most favorable for ordinary dreaming. Infants experience REM during about 50 percent of sleep, but by adulthood that has declined to an average of 22 percent (2).For most adults, REM sleep occurs every 90 minutes. The first cycle starts out as short as three minutes, but the duration increases with each cycle, so by early morning, the last cycle can last up to 55 minutes. During REM sleep, muscles are temporarily paralyzed -- protecting us from physically acting out these dreams with our bodies. Interestingly, it's not just our eyes that move rapidly, but our fingers and toes, too (3). While it was long believed that dreams happened only during REM sleep, it's now understood that there are different kinds of dreams that can happen during other sleep cycles, as well (4).We sleep for about one-third of our lives, and we have REM-sleep dreams for about one quarter of that time. With the realization that dreams also happen during ""Non-REM"" sleep, researchers have discovered that the time a person actually spends dreaming could be even longer. It's easy to see during sleep studies that people do dream -- but it's much more difficult for researchers to agree on why. Even during conferences held by experts in the field of dream studies, there's not an overall consensus for why we dream. But there are certainly a lot of theories. Dreams happen for physical, mental, emotional and even spiritual reasons, and there is widespread agreement that dreams can present opportunities for creativity, growth, health and wholeness. Dreams help us know ourselves better.  The time we spend dreaming can also help us solve problems by giving our minds free rein to examine all possible scenarios. In dreaming, our waking-life barriers come down, and new ideas can spring forth freely.One of the best features of ordinary dreams is that they can help us get in touch with our feelings, because in our waking lives, our rational, thinking minds can often get in the way.  For instance, legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus was having trouble with a golf swing -- but in a dream he was ""hitting them pretty good."" He told a San Francisco Chronicle reporter that he noticed that his hands were positioned differently in the dream, and the next day he remembered the grip, shaving three points off his game (5).That's just one example of how dreams can have an impact on daily life -- and there are many, from Paul McCartney hearing the tune of Yesterday in a dream, to Stephen King dreaming up the idea for his best-selling book, Misery (6, 7).Dreams also allow us to rehearse or practice for future events, learn about our bodies' physical needs, improve our diets, and heal emotional wounds from troubled relationships (8). It's a frequently asked question by DreamsCloud users, and most people would probably like to understand what happens during that lengthy period of time each night when different parts of our brains become active (9). Dream researchers may never reach consensus about why dreams happen, but they continue to provide an increasing amount of evidence that dreams play a much more important role in our lives and health than many people have previously imagined.

Zoe Saldana (ironically, a frequent name on our best-dressed lists) tells Lucky magazine this month:""I can give two sh*ts about what somebody thought I looked like. At the moment I conceived wearing an outfit, I had a thousand reasons. And now that it's done, and I'm getting feedback that it's not positive, I'm going to regret it? I take responsibility for my actions, whether the outcome is positive or negative.""Amen to that. Saldana is just one of many celebs who've spoken out about the criticism surrounding their fashion. Even Selena Gomez has said, ""I don't wear outfits or dresses because I feel like it's going to make the best-dressed lists in magazines; I really couldn't care less about things like that.""Then again, celebs are also able to laugh it off when an outfit choice goes awry. (Remember when Chrissy Teigen admitted her dress was a ""don't""? ""Note to self,"" she tweeted, ""try on in the light."")
