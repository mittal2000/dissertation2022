0,FIFTY,The Czech City Of Prague Is Full Of Character And Quirks,"Kathleen Peddicord, ContributorPublisher, Live and Invest Overseas",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travel-to-prague_b_11836110.html,"If I were to choose one word to describe Paris, it would be romantic. If I were to choose one word to describe Prague, a city often compared to Paris, it would be cynical ... in a good way.",2016-09-10,2016-09-02-1472837822-3162001-jewishmesquiteprague.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-02-1472837822-3162001-jewishmesquiteprague-thumb.jpg,"Like Paris But With A Wicked Sense Of HumorIf I were to choose one word to describe Paris, it would be romantic. If I were to choose one word to describe Prague, a city often compared to Paris, it would be cynical ... in a good way.From the point of view of an architect or a city planner, comparing Prague to Paris is understandable. In its glory days, Prague, 14th-century capital of the Holy Roman Empire, was of greater and wider repute than the City of Light.Czechs have spent an inordinate amount of their time, over their history, fighting, including two civil wars, one lasting 200 years. Much of the conflict has had to do with religion.Then, at the start of the 20th century, as one Czech put it, ""This country was offered up to the Nazis.""Here, have this land, the West seemed to say,"" my new Czech friend continued, ""with the hope, I guess, that the submission would satisfy Hitler enough that he'd give up on any grander land-grab plans.""Then, as in Budapest, the Nazis were replaced immediately by the commies. The country's Velvet Revolution ended 41 years of Stalinist rule in 1989. This recent history is palpable everywhere, not only in city structures and museums, but also in the people themselves.Czechs today don't take anything too seriously, including and especially religion or politics. Churches are empty, and the pope has little influence in this once solidly Catholic nation. Attitudes toward things like divorce, single moms, birth control, and abortion are liberal and laissez-faire.Attitudes toward most everything could be described the same way. We're tired of fighting, of being told what to do, what to believe, and how to behave ... we've had enough, modern-day Czechs seem to say. Leave us be, and we'll leave you be ...Czechs I met during my visit delighted in showing me physical manifestations of their current live-and-let-live manifesto. From the nearly life-sized upside-down dead horse -- with good King Wenceslaus as the frustrated rider -- that hangs from the ceiling of a center-city shopping arcade (""You can't make a dead horse run, no matter how hard you try,"" our Czech guide explained, ""and you can't make Czech politics run either..."") to the Two Peeing Men statue (the two men so occupied are standing over a map of the Czech Republic) and the statue of Sigmund Freud hanging from the side of a four-story building (""Don't try to figure it out,"" our guide told us. ""Freud had no connection to Prague, yet here he is just hanging out in Prague. When the wind blows, he swings back and forth. It doesn't have to make sense. It's very Czech...""), this city is delighting, it seems, in taking full advantage of its recently hard-won right to free speech.""One activist artist,"" one Czech told me, ""sculpted a giant pink middle finger that he placed, overnight, in view of the parliament building. He had no permit, so what he did was illegal. Everyone knew this, including the police, of course. But the big middle finger was left in place for three days. That's how much we Czechs really, really don't like our current president.""But, oh, well ... this guy will be out soon enough and we'll have another guy ...""The Czech Republic is struggling, like all former Eastern bloc countries, to get itself back on track. Driving to and from Prague we were delayed and detoured by constant road work. First things first, of course. That is, improving the infrastructure takes priority over rescuing and restoring historic structures, both in Prague and across the country.On my way from Prague to Krakow for an European tour, I stopped for lunch in the one-time royal city of Hradec Králové. Its big 13th-century, central town square is today a parking lot, the pastel-colored facades of the formerly chic structures surrounding it decaying in real time.This is the case across this country. Desperate for help to preserve what they can, the Czechs, I've been told, are making some properties of character and historical significance available for a crown (that is, a single Czech koruna).Original Feature: The Czech City Of Prague Is Full Of Character And QuirksRelated Articles:Living In Europe On A Budget Just Got EasierTop 8 Best Places To Buy Property In EuropeIs Buenos Aires Really The Paris Of Latin America?Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

3,POLITICS,Putin's Man in the White House?,"Robert S.

He has ""an 82 percent approval rating,"" Trump gushed. ""The man has very strong control over a country."" Trump said that Putin has ""been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader. We have a divided country.""That's right; we have a democracy. Obviously Trump prefers a system where the man at the top has ""very strong control over a country."" No division then. That position alone should disqualify Donald Trump from the presidency.Trump bubbled about how much Vladimir Putin likes him: ""Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, I'll take the compliment, OK?"" He added, ""If he says great things about me, I'm going to say great things about him.""Mr. Trump's continued kissing of the posterior of the Russian strongman makes urgent a question I raised here in July. It is posted again with a few alterations:Mole -- n. ""A spy who achieves over a long period an important position within the security defenses of a country.""Even Vladimir Putin's former employer, the KGB, probably never dreamed that it could make a Russian agent president of the United States, but Putin is coming close to achieving that greatest infiltration in the history of espionage.The evidence is growing by the day that Donald J. Trump is totally beholden to Russia. If elected, he would become the greatest mole in history.As a piece by David Frum in The Atlantic points out:For a candidate with few consistent views on anything, this adds up to a very clear picture. Joined with other evidence of Trump's deep personal business obligations to people in the Putin ruling circle, and his campaign leadership's long-standing involvement with the former pro-Putin authoritarian leader of Ukraine, the picture becomes even more troubling--even sinister.Trump refuses to release his tax returns, using the absurd excuse that he is under audit. There are many possible reasons for why he wants to hide his financial records, such as that he is not worth nearly as much as he claims and that he gives virtually nothing in charitable contributions. But it seems highly likely that the biggest reason why he refuses to release his tax returns is that they show his deep financial ties to Russian oligarchs and Putin cronies.""I have ZERO investments in Russia,"" Trump tweeted on July 26. Like most of what comes out of his mouth and from his tiny fingers typing tweets, this is a bold-faced lie. And the flow of money in the other direction--loans from Russians to keep Trump's empire afloat--are likely far greater.Trump is ready to do Putin's bidding by undermining NATO and virtually inviting him to invade the Baltic nations.Trump doesn't lie like a rug; he lies like a Russian agentAfter asserting in November, ""I got to know him [Putin] very well,"" Trump now says, ""I have nothing to do with Russia, nothing to do, I never met Putin, I have nothing to do with Russia whatsoever.""Trump doesn't lie like a rug; he lies like a Russian agent.In one of his infamous news conferences in July, Trump said, ""I'm not going to tell Putin what to do. Why should I tell Putin what to do?"" The real issue is whether Putin is--or will be if the Republican nominee becomes president--telling Trump what to do.The Deafening Silence of Republican ""Patriots""Imagine what all Republicans would be saying if a Democrat had such a record of allegiance to a foreign power.Why isn't the party of fear afraid of putting a Russian mole in the White House?When will Republicans put patriotism above party and denounce this evil and extremely dangerous man? When will they, at the very least, demand that he release his tax returns so we can see if he is a potential Russian agent?{Robert S.

Wade and are not beholden to the state’s more-restrictive abortion law.“Today’s opinion eliminates any ambiguity about the consistency of our state’s law with these federal constitutional rights and, as a result, removes an obstacle some New York women may encounter when trying to make their own reproductive health choices,” Schneiderman said in a statement.The state will officially allow late-term abortions if the pregnant woman’s health is at risk or if the fetus is “nonviable,” according to the opinion.Existing New York law says abortion is a crime unless performed “under a reasonable belief that such is necessary to preserve (the pregnant woman’s) life,” or within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy.The new opinion also assures reproductive health care providers operating in New York, such as Planned Parenthood, that “they may provide constitutionally protected reproductive health care services to women without fear of being complicit in a criminal act.”The opinion does not change the state’s penal code. It clarifies the state’s interpretation of federal law and that the law overrides state rule.New York, which was of the first states to legalize access to abortions, last modified its laws on the procedure in 1970, about three years before the Roe v. Wade decision.Civil rights and reproductive health care advocates applauded Schneiderman’s move.“New York’s abortion law, once ahead of its time, for too long has been woefully out of date, causing confusion for providers and leaving women without the full extent of their constitutionally-protected right to access abortion,” said Andrea Miller, President of the National Institute for Reproductive Health.“Today’s opinion by the attorney general is critical confirmation that women have a right to adequate medical care and reproductive choice in New York state,” said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.The organization said it plans to release a report next year that includes a collection of stories by women who were affected by New York’s unconstitutional abortion restriction."
5,POLITICS,Donald Trump Could Get Booted Off The Ballot In Minnesota,Ed Mazza,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-minnesota-ballot_us_57d2301de4b00642712ce14f,"""It is likely none of the Republican electors were legally elected.""",2016-09-09,Minnesota Democrats are trying to have Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump tossed off the ballot in their state.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump could be missing from the ballot in Minnesota on Election Day if Democrats get their way. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court to have the Republican presidential candidate’s name, along with the name of GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, removed from the ballot over a procedural flaw.The dispute stemmed from provisions requiring that each party nominate 10 electors and 10 alternates at their state conventions who would represent Minnesota in the Electoral College vote held after the presidential election. The GOP failed to select the alternate electors and almost didn’t make the ballot at all. The state party ultimately held a meeting to select the alternates, as the Washington Post reported last month. The Republican Party said Minnesota’s secretary of state accepted the alternates as meeting the legal requirements. Now, the DFL claims that since the GOP alternates weren’t selected at a state convention, as required by law, they shouldn’t count.“The Executive Committee is obviously not a ‘delegate convention,’ ” the petition stated. As a result, the DFL wants Trump booted from the ballot. “It is incumbent upon political parties to follow the rules binding our elections and in this instance it does not appear that the Minnesota Republican Party did so,” DFL Chair Ken Martin said in a news release. The state Supreme Court has a track record of handling election issues quickly, Pioneer Press reported. The DFL’s lawsuit was filed on Thursday.Although the state GOP has not responded to requests for comment on the issue, at least one GOP official admitted there might be a problem. Based on the wording of the law, “it is likely none of the Republican electors were legally elected,” James Carson, party chair for the fourth congressional district, told MinnPost.Minnesota hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since Richard M. Nixon in 1972, and was famously the only state to vote for Walter Mondale over Ronald Reagan in 1984."
6,POLITICS,Facebook Co-Founder Promises $20 Million To Elect Hillary Clinton,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dustin-moskovitz-hillary-clinton-donor_us_57d2cfbbe4b06a74c9f43f0e,Dustin Moskovitz has just become one of the biggest Democratic Party super PAC donors.,2016-09-09,Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz is now one of the biggest Democratic Party super PAC donors.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d2d02d170000ac34c78bc0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz announced that he and his wife, Cari Tuna, are contributing $20 million to help elect Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.In a post on Medium titled “Compelled to Act,” Moskovitz wrote that he and Tuna will donate $5 million each to the super PACs For Our Future and League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund and make limited contributions to the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party, MoveOn.org Political Action and Color of Change PAC. They will also contribute to a number of unnamed nonpartisan get-out-the-vote organizations.The $10 million promised to two super PACs will immediately catapult the duo into the upper echelon of Democratic big money donors in 2016. The couple would be the seventh-largest super PAC donor to groups supporting the Democratic Party.The reason Moskovitz is compelled to give so much money this year can be explained in two words: Donald Trump.Even though he and his wife have voted Democrat every election, they think of themselves as “independent thinkers who respect candidates and positions from both sides of the aisle,” he wrote. This election, however, is “a referendum on who we want to be — as individuals, as a nation and as a society.”For Moskovitz, Trump represents fear, tribalism and intolerance. He would lead the country to turn away from the world as represented by his number one policy priority, Moskovitz wrote ― “the literal building of a wall between us and our neighbor.”“So, for the first time, we are endorsing a candidate and donating,” he continued. “We hope these efforts make it a little more likely that Secretary Clinton is able to pursue the agenda she’s outlined, and serve as a signal to the Republican Party that by running this kind of campaign — one built on fear and hostility — and supporting this kind of candidate, they compel people to act in response. We are not the only ones being activated so strongly during this election.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

If you emote too little, you’re an ice cold b*tch. No one seems to understand this feminine quandary more than potential POTUS Hillary Clinton. And on Thursday, she distilled the pressure women feel to constantly modulate their emotional states down to two anecdotes, recorded by Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton.Clinton describes taking her law school admissions test at Harvard, in a group of nearly all men, many of whom viewed the few women in the room as an affront. She uses this experience as an entry point into the way women learn from a young age to adapt their emotional states to make those around them feel comfortable, and just how difficult it can be to toe the line between “emotional” and “closed off”:I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional. But I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions. And that’s a hard path to walk. Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don’t want to seem ‘walled off.’ And sometimes I think I come across more in the ‘walled off’ arena. In a second piece of the same interview, posted on Facebook just hours later, Clinton expanded on this idea.“I’ve learned that I can’t be quite so passionate in my presentation,” she told Stanton. “I love to wave my arms, but apparently that’s a little bit scary to people. And I can’t yell too much. It comes across as ‘too loud’ or ‘too shrill’ or ‘too this’ or ‘too that.’”Clinton has been consistently criticized over the years for being “angry,” “shrill,” “aloof,” “icy” and “ruthless.” She has spent decades hearing that she must adjust her tone of voice, her hair, her smile, her clothing and her level of emotiveness in order to appeal acceptable to the American public. Part of this is, of course, just par for the course when you live your life in the public eye. And it’s not just gender that plays a role in the way people police and react to a public figure’s emotional openness or lack thereof.But even given all of this, much of the criticism levied at Clinton, and at the very least, the way it is delivered, is unquestionably gendered. Just look at the “Trump That B*tch” and “Hillary Sucks, But Not Like Monica” T-shirts that became so popular during the RNC. (The mental gymnastics those who hate her seem to go through to deny that gender plays a role in people’s perceptions of Clinton only serves to reinforce the point.)Ultimately, when it comes to presentation ― emotional and physical ― there is a clear double standard. A male leader who raises his voice and speaks with his hands and shakes his head during a speech is passionate. A woman who does the same is angry and unhinged. The standard bearers for what “presidential” looks and sounds and acts like are all male. So anything Clinton does, even if she is emulating every successful presidential candidate before her, will play differently with the American people. The reason this particular interview with Clinton rings so true to so many women is that even women who never go into political or public life of any kind learn to do a carefully choreographed emotional dance. (This is likely especially true for women who came of age when Clinton did. We may still have a long way to go when it comes to gender parity, but things have certainly changed since Clinton took her Harvard Law admissions exam.)Women know that to receive respect in a professional setting means being articulate and assertive, but not aggressive or angry or b*tchy; warm and inviting, but not fake or emotional; passionate, but not threatening. Essentially you have to demand a seat at the table, while making those around you feel like they pulled that very seat up to the table for you.This outward emotional modulation matters because it’s something all women must learn to navigate, and then keep up forever. And it feels damn satisfying to hear a presidential candidate articulate what that feels like. "

But despite the setback, the Standing Rock Sioux scored a partial victory as three federal departments jointly announced Friday that work would not be authorized on the sensitive land while they reconsider the tribe’s concerns.The Standing Rock Sioux, whose reservation sits near the Dakota Access pipeline’s route, brought a lawsuit contending the pipeline will disturb places of cultural importance and possibly contaminate potable water from the Missouri River. They claim the permits granted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in July violate “multiple federal statutes,” including the National Historic Preservation Act.The order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington was a setback for the tribe, which wanted construction stopped while their lawsuit against the Army played out in court. “Aware of the indignities visited upon the Tribe over the last centuries, the Court scrutinizes the permitting process here with particular care,” Boasberg wrote. “Having done so, the Court must nonetheless conclude that the Tribe has not demonstrated that an injunction is warranted here.”But the court decision was almost counterbalanced by the surprise announcement from the Department of Justice, the Army and the Department of the Interior. The agencies said “construction of the pipeline on Army Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe will not go forward at this time.” They requested that Energy Transfer Partners, the pipeline builder, delay all work within 20 miles of the area during this review.“This case has highlighted the need for a serious discussion on whether there should be nationwide reform with respect to considering tribes’ views on these types of infrastructure projects,” the joint statement said.“Our voices have been heard,” Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II in a statement. “The Obama administration has asked tribes to the table to make sure that we have meaningful consultation on infrastructure projects. Native peoples have suffered generations of broken promises and today the federal government said that national reform is needed to better ensure that tribes have a voice on infrastructure projects like this pipeline.”The tribe also announced that it will appeal the judge’s ruling.Energy Transfer Partners did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiries about today’s decisions.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) applauded the Army’s decision.“The Justice Department, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Department of the Interior are right,” Sanders said in a statement. “It’s time to listen to our Native American brothers and sisters. We must stop the Dakota Access pipeline, once and for all.”If it’s completed, the pipeline will carry 570,000 barrels of crude per day from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota through South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Energy Transfer Partners, the company building it, say that the pipeline is more environmentally friendly than transporting the oil via trucks or trains. Demonstrations against the project have grown in recent weeks as supporters, including those from other tribes, have joined the ranks of the Standing Rock Sioux’s encampment near the work site. In recent weeks, there’s been conflict among the pipeline opponents, the company’s workers and local law enforcement. Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein was charged this week with criminal trespass and criminal mischief after allegedly spray-painting a bulldozer with the words, “I approve this message.” Protesters contesting the bulldozing of a burial site claimed they were attacked by guard dogs and doused with pepper spray Saturday, Democracy Now reported. Since August, during other altercations dozens of other people have been arrested, including the tribe’s chairman, on charges like disorderly conduct and trespassing.

He collapsed on the sidewalk after a volley of bullets, as several witnesses reacted with shock or anger.The 35-year-old undocumented immigrant, who arrived in Washington state’s apple-growing belt seeking opportunity about a decade ago, battled drug use and homelessness in the months leading up to the shooting.(Reporting by Eric M.

The issue has gained more attention because of high-profile breaches in recent years of government and private sector computers.U.S. intelligence officials suspect Russia was responsible for breaches of Democratic political organizations and state election systems to exert influence on the Nov. 8 presidential election. Russia has dismissed the allegations as absurd.Obama announced the new position in February alongside a budget proposal to Congress asking for $19 billion for cyber security across the U.S. government.

Jerry Brown (D) on Thursday, marking a major step forward in the fight against climate change.The new legislation will significantly ramp up the state’s existing efforts to reduce emissions, including increasing the state’s reliance on solar power, offering rebates for electric cars and placing stronger regulations on businesses. SB 32, authored by state Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), extends a 2006 law that required the state to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. (California is currently on track to meet that goal.) Under the new legislation, California must reduce emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.AB 197, written by Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia (D-Coachella), establishes a new legislative committee to oversee environmental regulation, giving lawmakers more say in efforts to improve air quality and reduce pollution. The new goals are the most ambitious of any U.S. state. And given the sheer scale of it ― California’s economy is now the world’s sixth largest ― the law could also serve as a model for international efforts to reduce emissions. “Climate change is real, and knowing that, California is taking action,” Brown said in a statement Thursday. “SB 32 and AB 197 are far-reaching moves that continue California on its path of vast innovation and environmental resilience.”The legislation also pledges to meet these goals “in a manner that benefits the state’s most disadvantaged communities,” noting that climate change disproportionately affects the urban poor, the elderly and rural populations. The addition was a nod to criticism that rebates on environmentally friendly products like solar panels mostly benefit upper-middle-class and wealthy families.“In order for California to remain an economic and environmental leader, the state will need to also be a trailblazer on issues related to equity,” Garcia said. “Placing the health and economic [benefits] of climate policy on vulnerable populations second will stunt the state’s prosperity.”The new targets will go into effect next year. The legislation faced significant opposition from the California Chamber of Commerce, oil companies and other pro-business and manufacturing groups, which derided the law as harmful to job creation. Brown acknowledged those challenges while signing the bill Thursday. “There’s powerful opposition,” he said. “These are real people with real bucks and real influence.” Brown, who will leave office in 2019, has staked his legacy on ameliorating global warming. In addition to SB 32, he’s pushed for increased use of alternative energy sources, advocated for action on climate change during global forums like the U.N. climate summit in Paris last year and pushed for an ambitious cap-and-trade program aimed at reducing the use of fossil fuels.The cap-and-trade program, however, has hit some stumbles ― of the 96 million credits for sale at the last auction, just 30.8 million sold. Nevertheless, the state’s Air Resources Board has declared cap-and-trade a success, citing reductions in pollution since the program went into place. Brown is currently courting lawmakers to renew the program beyond its 2020 expiration date."

I’m against social injustice and I feel like this was the right thing to do.”Marshall, who is black, is the third NFL player to not stand during the national anthem since Kaepernick began his sideline protest against racial injustice and police brutality.Kaepernick’s teammate Eric Reid joined in the protest during the 49ers’ pre-season finale last week while Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane sat on the bench last week against the Oakland Raiders.The NFL’s opening week resumes Sunday with 13 games and some players, including Seattle receiver Doug Baldwin and defensive end Cliff Avril have said they are considering not standing during the national anthem before their game against Miami.Many Americans saw Kaepernick’s gesture as a sign of disrespect to the flag and criticism was widespread, but he has also been supported by several fellow athletes, including Megan Rapinoe, a white soccer player who knelt before her game on Sunday.“While we encourage members of our organization to stand during the national anthem, we understand and respect it being a personal decision,” the Broncos said in a statement.Marshall, who was Denver’s second-leading tackler during their run to a Super Bowl title last season and a teammate of Kaepernick at the University of Nevada, said last week that he supported Kaepernick’s actions.“Brandon is a great kid. He is a leader of this team,” Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak said after the game. “I believe in our guys and I believe in them wholeheartedly. We move forward.”The use of force by police against African-Americans in cities such as Baltimore, New York, and Ferguson, Missouri, has sparked periodic and sometimes destructive protests in the past two years and prompted the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.Kaepernick led San Francisco to a Super Bowl berth in 2013 but has since been demoted to backup. He played in nine games last season and had more turnovers than touchdowns.But since he began his protests during the preseason Kaepernick’s jersey has become the top-selling jersey on the National Football League’s official online store.(Reporting by Brendan O’Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)"

17,POLITICS,Here's How HuffPost Averages The Polls And Figures Out Who's Ahead,Natalie Jackson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/huffpost-pollster-poll-averages-methodology_us_57d1a3b2e4b06a74c9f361cb,"It's actually a bit more technical than an ""average.""",2016-09-09,Everybody wants to know what the polls say about Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d3216a1300002b0039b0d7.jpeg?cache=v6OWOlMzBn&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The approach of the November election brings with it an endless tide of new polling data, which The Huffington Post uses to calculate who’s ahead in the big races. Readers may wonder how does the HuffPost Pollster model work and why isn’t our estimate of Hillary Clinton vs. Donald Trump exactly the same as that of other polling aggregators.Here’s how and why.The HuffPost Pollster charts for this year’s general election contests estimate the “average” of publicly available polls that meet our criteria for quality polling. HuffPost uses a Bayesian Kalman filter model, which we initially introduced in 2010 and have modified since to reflect the changing polling environment.Briefly, Kalman filter models combine data that are known to be “noisy” ― or not completely precise ― into a single estimate of the underlying “signal” ― that is, what’s actually happening. For HuffPost, that means the model looks for trends in the polls and produces its best estimate of the polling average.More technically, what the model calculates is a trend line estimate, not an average as most people think of it. The reason is that a simple average would be very susceptible to the deviations of individual polls. One outlier poll could pull the average in a completely different direction than the rest of the polls indicate. Our algorithm resists this tendency by requiring a trend in the movement of multiple polls in order to change the direction of the aggregated estimate.That means the model essentially downplays a single poll’s results that deviate substantially from what most of the other polls show. However, if more data come in and indicate that the deviant results are actually part of a trend, the trend line adjusts to accommodate that new information. So the model doesn’t ignore outlier polls; it just downplays them unless it becomes clear that they’re actually the beginning of a trend.In the national Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton chart, for example, the one early September CNN poll that showed Trump leading was basically treated as deviant data and didn’t have as much influence on the estimate as other recent polls. But if more polls come in showing Trump ahead or Clinton’s lead narrowing, the trend line will adjust to reflect the GOP nominee closing in.You can see how this dynamic played out in August: Clinton’s wide lead eroded as many polls found Trump rebounding. Clinton remains ahead by 5 percentage points in early September, but that’s down from a 8-point lead in the middle of August.The advantage of using a Kalman filter model is that it doesn’t swing wildly in response to outlier polls. The disadvantage is that it’s slower to react to real polling changes than a traditional average. Under normal circumstances, the estimate for each candidate can move up or down about 1.5 percent from the previous day’s estimate. But the model allows about a 5 percent chance a candidate’s numbers could move more than 1.5 percent in either direction in a single day. So if four or five polls all showed a dramatic shift in the same direction within a day, the candidate’s estimate could shift more than 1.5 percent.That means that we currently show a wider race between Trump and Clinton than do simple averages, such as the model used by RealClearPolitics. The HuffPost trend line will favor Clinton when the polls have generally favored Clinton and the polls showing Trump ahead ― or within a couple of points ― appear to be deviations. The model would be similarly sticky on a Trump lead if the polling fairly consistently pointed toward the GOP nominee. On a more technical note, because of the calculations the HuffPost model has to make, we don’t run it until we have five or more polls for a particular contest. The model runs 100,000 simulations of the data on each date of polling to find the most likely average, and it needs at least five polls to do that reliably.The model begins running simulations to calculate a candidate’s estimates on the first date of the first poll. It incorporates the polls available for each subsequent day, pulling in additional surveys as it continues toward the current date — at which time all of the polls (that meet HuffPost’s criteria) are being considered. Newer polls are more influential in a given day’s average than older polls, because older polls are inherently less reliable, more uncertain measures of the current state of the race. But there’s not a specific cutoff date for excluding an older poll. If there aren’t any recent polls, the “error bands” (those shaded regions around the trend lines that show the range within which 95 percent of the simulations fell) will be wider to indicate the uncertainty.The HuffPost model also weights polls by their sample size, because larger samples have smaller margins of error. But any polls with samples above 3,000 are weighted as if they had no more than 3,000 so that the very large surveys that internet pollsters are able to produce don’t dominate the model. Once all the simulations have run, the model averages their results to produce a estimate of the percentage support for each candidate (including “other”) on each date, in addition to estimates of the percentage of undecided voters and the margin between the candidates. The probability that the leading candidate actually leads ― which the chart describes as “very likely,” “likely” or “probably” ― is determined based on the margin between the candidates.Finally, for our primary election, job approval and other non-election charts, and for the chart customizations on the election charts, we continue to calculate the trend estimates using a loess regression. The principle is similar to the Kalman filter model in that a loess regression uses available polling data to estimate a trend of where the polls are on average, but the latter model is much simpler and doesn’t rely on thousands of simulations. Instead, it runs a regression analysis on the polls within a certain range of each date to calculate the trend line. More information about that can be found here."
18,WOMEN,Every Person Behind This Music Festival Is A Woman. Here's Why That Matters.,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/every-person-behind-togetherfest-music-festival-is-a-woman_us_57d1afbde4b06a74c9f37e3c,"At TogetherFest, everyone from the artists to the sound engineers will be women.",2016-09-09,Co-creator of TogetherFest Leah Jackson a.k.a. Ms. Jackson.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d1b6e91600009e26c018f0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two women are trying to make a dent in the glaring gender gap in music festival lineups.Producer Audrey Joseph and DJ Leah Jackson, known by her stage name Ms. Jackson, are bringing a one-day all-female electronic music festival, TogetherFest, to the Armory in San Francisco this fall. The festival will feature DJs including Brazzabelle, Dani Deahl, Little Boots and more. “We have this opportunity to really showcase women’s talents and create a space for people of all genders to come and watch great music together,” Jackson told The Huffington Post. Over half (51 percent) of the 32 million people who attend music festivals each year are women. Unfortunately, the demographics on stage are very different.In a recent data analysis, The Huffington Post found that an overwhelming majority of festival line-ups are male. Out of 10 of the most popular American music festivals, male acts made up anywhere from 66 percent to 93 percent of all performers. What makes TogetherFest so unique is that it’s not just the performers who are female ― the entire event will be run by women. From the stagehands to the bartenders, sound engineers and security, the festival is truly an all-female production. “We want women who are talented, excited and who share that belief that women deserve a safe space and community,” Jackson said. “That doesn’t exist anywhere else.” The Huffington Post spoke with Jackson about the inspiration behind TogetherFest, sexism in the music industry and what she hopes the audience will take away from the all-female festival. What inspired you and Audrey Joseph to create TogetherFest?I’ve had the idea for a female-only-focused event in San Francisco for about 5 or 6 years. And then last year my partner, Audrey Joseph, and I connected when she started working at the Armory.  We came to realize that there is no music festival on the west coast that has an all-female-focused performance base. After we came to that realization, we really dove into doing our research about the problem that does exist in the music industry, including night life and music festivals. It’s a huge problem, it’s glaring ― and no one’s doing anything about it. When Audrey and I finally sat down to put our vision together for this festival, we realized we want to fix that problem. I think the inspiration really came from the fact that we wanted to help fix such a major issue in our industry and in our world. Audrey has always been a big advocate for women’s rights and has been producing events for the past 25 years in San Francisco. She’s a risk-taker and we’re both making a statement by doing this event because it’s the first music event for the Armory’s reopening. It’s pretty awesome that we get to advocate for women in the first event in the space.Why do you think there’s such a large gender gap at music festivals?It follows the problem of sexism in our world in general, and the larger problem of sexism within the music industry as a whole. I think that the majority of people who are running the industry are male. When I was growing up, just starting my career in radio, that gender divide was just as alarming back then as it is now. I don’t think there’s been a real change. Men control the majority of the music business. There’s been some progress in the last 20 years, but from my personal experience ― working in music, being a DJ and also working in nightlife ― the change hasn’t been big enough. Audrey and I are both females and we’re going to be running the production and putting this entire event together as women. I think it’s a small move when you take a look at the big picture, but we’re nonetheless trying to initiate change.Sexism in the music industry seems to be this systemic issue that hasn’t really made much notable progress in the last few decades.We’re not trying to come across that we don’t support men in music. That’s definitely not the purpose of this. It is very apparent that there’s an issue of sexism within festivals and music, but I think there’s a space that can exist ― especially in the Bay Area ― that can really focus on women. Part of our lineup is LGBT, which represents the Bay Area really equally. I’m a fan of all music. We have this opportunity to really showcase women’s talents and create a space for people of all genders to come and watch great music together.I think it goes back to the idea that women need safe spaces for a reason, but it doesn’t mean that men and allies aren’t allowed into those spaces. I read that most of the people behind the festival ― sound engineers, stagehands, bartenders, etc. ― are women?In addition to the performers, we’re actually hiring mostly women. Our bartenders are going to be women, our vendors are companies that are founded or created by women all around the Bay Area. That’s the community that we want to bring into the event. We want this to be a place that allows young girls to be like, “Wow, I could be a sound engineer,” or “I could be a stagehand or do security.” We want women who are talented, excited and who share that belief that women deserve a safe space and community. That doesn’t exist anywhere else, and I think for this specific industry ― because it’s so male-focused ― an event like this really does open up so many more doors for women. Watch a teaser for TogetherFest below and continue reading below. Have you experienced sexism as a DJ or just working in the music industry in general?I’ve been really lucky, I don’t remember anything specifically sexist. There’s been a few times when I’m DJing and people have said, “Wow, you’re a really good DJ.” And it’s a funny comment because in my head I’m always like, “Well, what does that mean? Are you surprised that a female DJ can be good?” It’s kind of like a unicorn thing, people will be like “I’ve just never seen a female DJ before.” It does make you feel good and special that I’m standing out but first and foremost I’m a DJ, I’m not a female DJ. I’m just a DJ.What do you hope the future of TogetherFest will be?Our future is to grow this out as much as possible. Hopefully we can have the event in different cities around the country, and feature artists from those areas and communities. How amazing would it be to have TogetherFest in New York or LA or Chicago or Atlanta? Our goal is to be able to reach those female artists around the country that might not have the opportunity to perform on big stages and bring them to a wider audience. It’s an opportunity to serve the underserved. This interview has been edited and condensed. TogetherFest will take place at the SF Armory on Oct. 8.

He was arrested on a charge of filing a false police report.Winston-Salem police also said Friday it had found no evidence to substantiate a report earlier this week of a clown attempting to lure children into a wooded area by offering them treats.Reports of clown sightings in the state and neighboring South Carolina since late August have residents on edge and prompted more police patrols. In most cases, investigators have found no one matching the varying descriptions of the clowns.Creepy clowns are a fixture of pop culture and entertainment in the United States. Best-selling U.S. horror author Stephen King weighed in on the recent reports, noting the fear of clowns touches a nerve with both children and adults.But reported sightings of scary-looking clowns also conjure up real-life horror stories like those about John Wayne Gacy Jr., the serial killer and rapist who dressed as a clown and murdered more than 30 teenage boys and young men in Cook County, Illinois, in the 1970s.In Greenville, South Carolina, where there have been several reported sightings, police are treating the cases as suspicious activity while trying to determine if they are legitimate or hoaxes.“We’re still investigating to see what the actual purpose is, whether it’s for ill intent or if it’s a prank,” said Officer Gilberto Franco, a Greenville police spokesman.A film distributor debunked speculation that the sightings were connected to the release of director Rob Zombie’s new independent horror movie “31,” which features a gang of sadistic clowns. Saban Films said it was “not associated in any way with the creepy clowns and costumed characters found roaming the South.”"

Marshall’s actions ― a protest against social injustice that followed San Fransisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s decision to kneel during the anthem ― were “not a representation of our organization and membership,” the credit union’s CEO, Glenn Strebb, said in a statement.“I’m not against the military or police or America at all,” Marshall said of his decision to kneel. “I’m against social injustice and I feel like this was the right thing to do.”The Broncos said they respected Marshall’s decision to protest, though added they encourage members to stand during the anthem. After the game, a media relations staff member advised Marshall not to look at his Twitter mentions because “there’s gonna be a lot of hate,” MMQB reported. “They said, ‘you might lose endorsements,’” Marshall told the publication. “I’m ready for that.”"

Carlson’s lawsuit reportedly encouraged more than 20 other women to come forward, including primetime star Megyn Kelly. Ailes resigned within weeks. In his Facebook post, Rivera goes into detail about his decades-long professional and personal history with Ailes to explain his initial shock over the allegations, saying “he had my back through thick and thin,” especially when Rivera was covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.“Now I am filled with regret for stubbornly discounting their various allegations,” Rivera added, referring to the women who have come forward. “Like victims of sexual assault, those alleging harassment deserve the presumption of credibility.”Rivera even apologized to New York magazine writer Gabriel Sherman, who’s broken most of the news around the story.

Whether or not individual officers will opt against working the games remains to be seen, but the letter appears to answer the question of whether there will be a top-down call for a boycott. Roughly 70 officers voluntarily work each 49ers game, according to the Associated Press.The news came the same day as the 49ers announced owner Jed York would donate $1 million to help police-community relations and inner-city children."

The other carried their wheelchairs.Both Alan, 30, and Gyan, 28, are teachers who were born with muscular dystrophy. Attacks by the so-called Islamic State destroyed their home two years ago, and they fled northern Syria by land and sea, with their family’s help. Amnesty International has now released a video about these two tenacious siblings and their onerous journey.After traveling through the mountains with the horses in 2014, the family lived in Iraq for a year and a half until ISIS forced them to flee again. In March, Mohammad and his mother, brother and two younger sisters, paid a smuggler $750 per person to get on a inflatable boat to the Greek island of Chios. The raft was so overcrowded, packed with anxious parents transporting crying babies and children, that the Mohammad family was forced to leave the two precious wheelchairs behind.“For ‘normal people’ it is very difficult,” Alan Mohammad said. “But for disabled people it is like a miracle to cross the borders.”Now stranded in Greece after the borders to Europe were closed, the family is living in a makeshift refugee camp in Ritsona, about 50 miles outside Athens. Their end goal is to make it to Germany, where their father and another sister are now living.“It’s a difficult life for a healthy person, so you can imagine what it’s like for a [disabled] person, and I have two, not just one,” said Mohammad’s mother, Amsha Hussein Mohammad. “And their disability is not just any kind of disability. They cannot do anything. All of their bodies are disabled. They can’t get themselves a glass of water. They can’t even wipe their own tears.”But despite the arduous journey, despite the closed borders and the camp’s dire conditions, Mohammad has hope. He’s passing the days teaching English to the camp’s children in a classroom set up inside a tent.“I decide to help the kids here because I found them losing a lot of time by playing, out between the trees, and they aren’t doing any important things here, just playing without learning,” he said. “So I decided to teach them English.”"

Kerry, wary of getting the guarantees to make the deal work, had postponed his departure for Geneva for a day.“The Obama administration, the United States, is going the extra mile here because we believe that Russia, and my colleague (Lavrov), have the ability to press the Assad regime to stop this conflict and to come to the table and make peace,” he said.Kerry said the “bedrock” of the deal was an agreement that the Syrian government would not fly combat missions in an agreed area, on the pretext of hunting fighters from the banned Nusra Front, an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria.“That should put an end to the barrel bombs, and an end to the indiscriminate bombing, and it has the potential to change the nature of the conflict.”After a sustained period of reduced violence, Russia and the United States would work together to develop military strikes against Nusra and Islamic State, Kerry said.“Going after Nusra is not a concession to anyone. It is profoundly in the interests of the United States to target al Qaeda, to target al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria which is Nusra.“We must go after these terrorists. Not indiscriminately, but in a strategic, precise and judicious manner so they cannot continue to use the regime’s indiscriminate bombing to rally people to their hateful crimes.”All sides in the conflict would need to adhere to the nationwide truce, Kerry said.“This requires halting all attacks, including aerial bombardments, and any attempts to gain additional territory at the expense of the parties to the cessation. It requires unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access to all of the besieged and hard-to-reach areas including Aleppo.”Both warring sides would pull back from the strategic Castello Road in Aleppo to create a demilitarized zone, while opposition and government groups would both have to provide safe and unhindered access via Ramouseh in the south of the city.If the truce holds from Monday, Russia and the United States will begin seven days of preparatory work to set up a “joint implementation center”, including some information sharing to delineate territory controlled by Nusra and opposition groups.The United States and Russia have backed opposite sides in Syria’s civil war, which has shown little sign of ending after more than five years of violence in which half the pre-war population has been uprooted.Moscow supports President Bashar al-Assad and Washington supports the opposition, saying Assad must go.Kerry’s proposal for military cooperation with Russia over Syria has faced resistance from U.S. defense and intelligence officials, who argue that Moscow cannot be trusted.The United Nations said on Friday the Syrian government had effectively stopped aid convoys this month and the besieged city of Aleppo was close to running out of fuel, making the talks even more urgent.(Editing by Larry King and Tom Brown)"

Meningitis, an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, can be deadly without proper treatment, and Madaya lacked medical supplies or equipment.Again, luck played a role. On Thursday, The Syrian Arab Red Crescent transported the family to Damascus, where they have reunited with Yaman and are receiving care, according to Syrian doctor Mohamed Darwich, who has been treating the family since Yaman was diagnosed. “We are just so happy,” said Yaman’s mother, Khawalah Jabir. “We feel at ease now.”The past few weeks have been incredibly stressful for the family. Jabir was not allowed to travel to Damascus with young Yaman due to limited capacity, and had no contact with him while they were separated. Dealing with her family’s illness, as well as her own, left Jabir at her wits’ end.“I didn’t know if I had any more hope left,” she said.But then the Ezzedine family, among others, found out they were being evacuated from their besieged town, which suffers from severe food and medical shortages. Their relatives in the United States rejoiced at the news and now say they feel inspired to direct their careers toward medicine.“I am just so emotional,” said Yousif Jabir, Khawalah’s brother, who lives in Allentown, Pennsylvania. “My kids were crying every day, feeling helpless. Now they’re more determined to go to medical school after hearing about the whole ordeal.”Khawalah is one of 11 siblings in the Jabir family, all of whom were raised in Syria. She and her brother remained close even after he moved to the United States with his three children.“At first, it was just me keeping in touch,” Yousif Jabir said. “But now, after all this, the kids are more determined to ask about their cousin Yaman and the rest of the family.” They plan on keeping in touch through photographs, videos and other forms of multimedia as often as possible. Meanwhile, the Ezzedine family does not plan to return to Madaya, but to move in with Yaman’s paternal grandparents in Baramkeh, Damascus. Not many families are so fortunate. Madaya continues to be under siege by the Syrian regime, forcing an estimated 40,000 residents to suffer from food and supply shortages. The town, just an hour’s drive from Damascus, first came to global attention in January when images of emaciated residents, including many children, emerged. The international outcry forced the government to allow food and medicine in, but the aid proved to be minimal. Reports indicate that residents are still dying from malnutrition, starvation and preventable diseases.Darwich worries that more Madaya residents may already be infected with meningitis but are not displaying symptoms because the virus or bacteria is still in its incubation phase. “Evacuating patients is not the fundamental solution,” Darwich said. “We need more than evacuations. We need aid. We need food. The main problem is the siege not allowing these things to enter and that causes for people to get sick.”Darwich says a lot more needs to be done for residents still trapped inside the town, but that he’s happy for the Ezzedine family.Said Jabir from a hospital in Damascus: “I feel like I’m dreaming.” "

But Gracie is an exception to that rule: She’s been specially trained to keep animals away.This 2-year-old “bark ranger” is the latest ― and without question, the cutest ― tool in Glacier National Park’s fight to limit dangerous human-wildlife interactions, which have become a growing problem in many of America’s national parks.“She’s there to help keep the wildlife wild,” Timothy Rains, a spokesman for the Montana park, told The Huffington Post. “There’s just something about the dog that makes it easy.”Perhaps it’s that face ― one humans adore and wild animals confuse for that of a predator.Glacier first introduced its wildlife service dog to the world in May, when she was being trained as part of a new pilot project funded by the Glacier National Park Conservancy. Since first reporting for duty in mid-July, Gracie has been hard at work herding sheep and goats away from Logan Pass and other high-traffic areas in an effort to keep safe both the animals and the visitors who come to see them.Until Gracie came along, park rangers resorted mainly to waving their arms, shouting and sounding sirens to chase animals out of parking lots. Those solutions, however, were often short-lived, as the critters tended to return quickly.With Gracie, Rains said, the park is capitalizing on natural predator-prey instincts. “[The animals] don’t think she’s a dog, they think she’s a wolf,” he said. Rains said Gracie works roughly two shifts per week, give or take, so that the wildlife does not get used to having her around. The whole point is for the sheep and goats to feel threatened.In addition to managing wildlife, Gracie also manages visitors by drawing people in so that her handler, park ranger Mark Biel, can educate them about park safety information like the importance of viewing wildlife from a distance.“No one wants to talk to me, but if they see her they come up and pet her, then I’ve got you,” Biel told National Public Radio.As Rains put it, Gracie “helps soften the blow” for visitors that have to be told they are breaking park safety rules.So far, the young pup has proven herself an important member of the Glacier team. At Logan Pass, groups of animals are already keeping greater distances from the parking lot, and visitors are quick to ask questions about and take pictures with the photogenic, four-legged ranger, according to Rains.“It’s been successful this summer,” Rains said of the program, adding that the plan is to expand it next year. “We put a lot of faith in the dog and she stood up to the challenge.”For those interested in following this “bark ranger’s” journey, Glacier National Park has set Gracie up with her own Instagram account.

31,BUSINESS,Wells Fargo Just Made The Case For Elizabeth Warren’s Bank Agency,Emily Peck and Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wells-fargo-fraud_us_57d2d237e4b03d2d459a083c,"The bank was scamming customers for years, until the CFPB put an end to it.",2016-09-09,"Richard Cordray is the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which exposed Wells Fargo's massive scam on Thursday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d2d5601800006c32bd05f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wells Fargo just proved, again, that no scam is beneath America’s financial institutions. And no institution is above being watched by a federal agency.On Thursday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ― the watchdog group proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D. Mass.) in the aftermath of the financial crisis ― announced that Wells Fargo would pony up a total of $185 million for perpetrating a huge scam on its customers. Over at least the past five years, Wells Fargo employees created more than 1.5 million sham checking accounts and applied for 565,000 credit cards, using customer names and money. Customers were charged unnecessary fees, saw their credit scores fall or were simply confused when debit and credit cards they never asked for showed up in the mail.“Was the Great Financial Crisis so long ago that all chasteness and propriety are already out the window? This scam has been apparently going on for five years,” writes Josh Brown, a financial blogger. “These people are fearless.”The CFPB has come under intense criticism from Republicans, who say it’s a drag on business. Many ― including presidential hopeful Donald Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence ― have said they would like to see the agency abolished as part of their intended dismantling of the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation passed to prevent another economic meltdown.But every time the agency exposes wrongdoing in consumer banking ― as it did on Thursday ― the CFPB offers a strong counterpoint to those arguments. The job of the CFPB, now headed by Richard Cordray, isn’t to regulate the hot new derivative investment banks are peddling to hedge funds. It’s to protect ordinary people from the kind of everyday scams that financial institutions have shown again and again that they will commit if no one is watching. The agency oversees a myriad of businesses like consumer banking, debt collection and payday loans that hundreds of millions of Americans use every day.It’s had an impact. Last year, the CFPB fined Citibank for illegal credit card practices after the bank was found to be charging customers for benefits they didn’t receive. It’s uncovered student loan fraud and financial products that take advantage of the elderly, and is looking to crack down on the payday loan industry.Though it’s obviously a huge blow to the bank’s reputation, the Wells Fargo fraud wasn’t even that profitable ― scamming thousands and thousands of customers out of a total of $2.6 million in surprise fees over five years doesn’t provide much financial boost to a bank that made $86.1 billion in revenue and $22.9 billion in profit last year alone. The scam also wasn’t really that profitable to the rank-and-file employees who carried it out. Retail bank employees inhabit the lowest rung of the finance industry. They make an industry average of around $10 an hour, and turnover is incredibly high.The fine the CFPB levied in response to the fraud is the largest the agency has ever imposed. The remaining millions will go to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the city and county of Los Angeles, which helped to uncover the scam.The bank also must refund all fees to customers ― about $2.6 million ― including overdraft charges and penalties for falling below minimum balances on sham accounts.The bank wouldn’t say if any senior executives were leaving the organization in response to the fraud. But it did say that it had fired 5,300 workers over the past five years in connection with the scam ― out of a division of 100,000. That would seem to mean about 5 percent of the group was engaged in wrongdoing. In an email to HuffPost, the bank argued that only 1 percent of employees in the division were involved. It’s curious accounting, and seems to imply that each worker is new every year.“Our entire culture is centered on doing what is right for our customers. However, at Wells Fargo, when we make mistakes, we are open about it, we take responsibility, and we take action. Today’s agreements are consistent with these beliefs,” the bank said in a statement Thursday.After the nation’s biggest banks utterly burned down Americans’ trust and faith by wrecking the economy in 2008, you’d imagine that Wells Fargo and other large institutions would be working overtime to earn it back. Maybe they are, but the bank’s senior management also put perverse incentives in place that pushed employees to defraud customers.Wells Fargo tellers earn about 3 percent in incentive pay for sales and customer service, while personal bankers make about 15 percent to 20 percent of their total earnings from these payments, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2013. They have daily quotas to fill, and are threatened with being fired if they don’t meet them.The intense pressure to meet sales goals doesn’t just push traders and bankers who make millions of dollars a year to fudge the numbers or rip off clients, it also warps the judgment of even junior employees. This latest scandal is fraud at the lowest level ― perpetuated by poorly paid employees and felt by everyday consumers.The scandal is also a reminder that profitability or customer losses are incomplete gauges of the damage financial fraud wreaks. A bank is in the businesses of holding not just your money, but also your sensitive, personal information.Trust should be its most valuable currency.But when a bank doesn’t value trust, it’s important to have a consumer protection agency that does. It’s worth pointing out that after the LA Times called attention to Wells Fargo’s high-pressure tactics in 2013, nothing much happened. It took the CFPB finally coming in to fix the problem.Though the CFPB undoubtedly performed a public service in stopping this wrongdoing, its action will likely do little to slow down the growth of Wells Fargo. That’s just one more counterpoint to the Republican claim that the CFPB is detrimental to the growth and health of the financial industry.Ultimately, the bank won’t feel much pain from this latest development. The fine is peanuts to an institution that makes billions of dollars. As of this writing, Wells Fargo stock price has hardly changed from when the news of its wrongdoing broke."
32,MEDIA,Media Matters Steps Up Legal Threat Against Fox News And Roger Ailes,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/media-matters-roger-ailes-phone-records_us_57d302cbe4b00642712d676b,The progressive organization is seeking information following a report that Fox News obtained its journalist's phone records.,2016-09-09,Media Matters is considering legal action against Fox News and Roger Ailes. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d30862160000fe26c01cf8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Media Matters for America took another step toward legal action Friday following a report that Fox News obtained phone records for one of the progressive organization’s journalists. New York magazine’s Gabriel Sherman revealed the initial incident in this week’s cover story on former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes’ recent fall from power in the wake of widespread sexual harassment allegations and multiple lawsuits. “Fox News also obtained the phone records of journalists, by legally questionable means,” Sherman reported. “According to two sources with direct knowledge of the incident, [Dianne] Brandi, Fox’s general counsel, hired a private investigator in late 2010 to obtain the personal home- and cell-phone records of Joe Strupp, a reporter for the liberal watchdog group Media Matters.”Brandi denied the incident to Sherman through a spokesperson. Media Matters attorney Marc Elias sent letters Friday to attorneys representing Ailes and executives at Fox News and parent company 21st Century Fox, including executive chairman Rupert Murdoch and sons Lachlan and James Murdoch, who serve as executive chairman and chief executive, respectively.In the letters, Elias requested Ailes and executives at the media companies retain any information in their possession or control that would be relevant to allegations of surveilling Media Matters employees.Strupp reported in 2010 on Fox News management slanting Washington coverage to the right and cited anonymous sources at the network. Sherman wrote that Fox News wanted to find out who was speaking to Strupp. “This was the culture,” one Fox News executive told Sherman. “Getting phone records doesn’t make anybody blink.”In addition to Strupp, Elias also revealed in the letters that it “appears that Fox News Channel previously obtained telephone records of Media Matters founder David Brock in 1997.” Brock, a former Republican operative turned liberal Clinton booster, wrote a critical profile of Ailes that year for New York magazine. Brock started Media Matters in 2004 to combat what the group deemed conservative misinformation, with Fox News being one of its primary targets. “Media Matters takes these reports very seriously and is prepared to take all measures necessary to protect its rights, including initiating a lawsuit against Fox News Channel,” Elias wrote in a letter to the network. “We therefore demand that Fox News Channel take immediate action to preserve all information relating to the Media Matters Surveillance that is in the possession, custody, or control of Fox News Channel, including information held by third parties from whom Fox News Channel could obtain the information or over whom Fox News Channel exercises control.”Media Matters is similarly prepared to take legal action if necessary against Ailes and 21st Century Fox, according to the letters published in full below. A 21st Century Fox spokeswoman declined to comment.Representatives for Fox News and Ailes did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “We’re taking this very seriously,” Media Matters president Bradley Beychok told The Huffington Post.Beychok said Media Matters is “trying to get a complete picture” of what happened before determining its next steps. He said the organization doesn’t yet know “the depth of this breach” given that the two alleged incidents span from 1997 to 2010.Fox News’ public relations department has been notoriously aggressive in dealing with reporters covering the network. And Ailes ― a former bareknuckle Republican operative now advising Donald Trump ― reportedly used private detectives to follow adversarial journalists and compiled a 400-page opposition research file on Sherman, author of a deeply reported and unauthorized 2014 biography of the secretive media titan. (Ailes is now threatening a suit against Sherman and New York magazine). Still, Sherman’s report that a Fox News executive obtained a journalist’s phone records would take Ailes’ monitoring of the press to another level and invites comparisons to the British phone hacking scandal that embroiled Murdoch’s media empire a few years back. Elias referenced the phone hacking scandal in the letters sent Friday. “In closing, we emphasize once again the importance of taking immediate and affirmative action to preserve all potentially relevant evidence,” he wrote. “As shown by earlier hacking scandals involving News Corp–affiliated entities, initial reports of these sorts of activities often reveal only the ‘tip of the iceberg.’ We expect to discover additional wrongdoing in the course of our investigation.”Read the full letters below:"

Seven years after being sworn in as the court’s first Hispanic justice, Sotomayor said she still is in awe of her job but also recognizes it comes with a big responsibility. “I never forget that in every case, someone wins, and there’s an opposite, someone loses,” she told students. “And that burden feels very heavy to me. I have not anticipated how hard decision-making is on the court. Because of that big win and lose on the court... we are affecting lives across the country and sometimes across the world.

Substances classed as Schedule I include heroin, LSD and, most controversially, marijuana. The emergency scheduling move on kratom is set to go into effect as early as the end of September, at which point it will enact a two-year ban that the federal government can make permanent. The DEA’s attack on another naturally occurring substance attracted immediate pushback from kratom supporters and drug policy experts, who reject the agency’s claim that the herb is an “imminent hazard to public safety.” Kratom users say the DEA ignored anecdotal evidence and emerging science that suggests the drug could be a promising treatment for a variety of ailments, including chronic pain and opioid addiction.Kratom contains alkaloids that appear to activate opioid receptors in the brain and reduce pain. And although most opioids have sedative qualities, low to moderate doses of kratom actually serve as a mild stimulant. All of this has made it a popular traditional medicine for millennia in Asia and more recently in the West.The sudden move to ban kratom makes a mockery of the federal government’s claims to be concerned about the suffering unleashed by the opioid epidemic. The White House and members of Congress have been vocal about encouraging doctors to prescribe fewer opiates, but the DEA is banning an herbal alternative that can help do just that ― presumably much to the pleasure of pharmaceutical companies, which would be glad to see the demise of an affordable competitor.A number of drug policy reform advocates have called out the federal government for once again rushing toward prohibition, a strategy that has repeatedly proven more harmful than helpful. But congressional lawmakers have yet to say anything about this escalation of the drug war.Although the DEA has the authority to enact this “emergency” policy, Congress could use its upcoming spending bill to block it from doing so. But the political will would have to be there.The Huffington Post reached out to Congress’ most progressive voices on drug policy for comment on the kratom ban. Some declined to comment. Others didn’t respond at all. The group includes dozens of members, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), all of whom have been vocal supporters of reforming marijuana laws. Since relatively few Americans use kratom, it’s not clear if these lawmakers are entirely aware of what’s going on.“There’s not been substantial or overwhelming interest from our congressional affairs counterparts, but we are in the eve of pre-election campaigning and members of Congress just came back this week,” Russ Baer, a spokesman for the DEA, told HuffPost. “We suspect there will be an ongoing dialogue in terms of educating members of Congress regarding our intent to schedule kratom.”But with potentially just three weeks left until the scheduling change for kratom takes effect, the DEA’s actions have so far been subject to minimal oversight. The agency didn’t ask for public comment ahead of its announcement, and the founder of one of the nation’s largest kratom advocacy groups told HuffPost she didn’t hear the news until she read it online last week.A petition asking the White House not to schedule kratom reached 113,000 signatures on Saturday, crossing the 100,000 threshold that requires a response from the administration.One watchdog is now questioning how the ban materialized. In a letter published Thursday, the Center for Regulatory Effectiveness, a for-profit think tank that has been a persistent thorn in the side of government regulators, asked the DEA for a copy of the administrator’s correspondence with the Department of Health and Human Services. The DEA says it informed HHS of its plan to ban kratom in May, and that the assistant secretary of HHS didn’t object. The Center wants to make sure the process complied with the Data Quality Act, a controversial statute that requires federal regulatory actions to be based on “quality” data.The lack of scrutiny over this action is troubling, especially considering the widespread implications of a DEA offensive against thousands of Americans who are already using kratom for treatment, as well as manufacturers and distributors in the U.S. and abroad. Furthermore, critics are concerned that the agency used isolated reports to make a series of inaccurate and alarmist claims about kratom, while simultaneously ignoring emerging science that suggests the herb could have a variety of medical benefits.“Congress has oversight over the DEA and has the responsibility to question the agency and its actions,” said Grant Smith, deputy director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for progressive reform of drug laws.“In this case, we have a lot of anecdotal evidence that kratom has therapeutic potential, yet the DEA is intending to put this in Schedule I, which is designated for compounds that have no medical value,” Smith continued. “It also is a schedule that is reserved for drugs with a high potential for abuse, yet the research I’ve seen doesn’t corroborate that.”Indeed, while initial studies have found that kratom could have some addictive potential, they have pointed to possible medicinal applications as well. Most scientific literature has also noted that the plant has a low potential for abuse or acute harm, such as overdose.Walter Prozialeck, a professor of pharmacology at Midwestern University who wrote a comprehensive literature review on kratom for The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, previously told HuffPost that he found kratom doesn’t produce much of a psychoactive high when taken in low or moderate doses. This means, he said, it doesn’t appear to have a particularly high potential for recreational use.Other scientists are more optimistic about how kratom interacts with the human body. Andrew Kruegel, a researcher at Columbia University, has been examining the chemistry of the active alkaloids in kratom, and earlier this year published a study with some fascinating findings.Here’s how Eric Boodman explained Kruegel’s results in a recent article for the medical news site Stat:When an opioid binds to a receptor, it can trigger a few different responses in a cell. One is thought to be responsible for causing pain relief. Another is thought to be responsible for the negative side effects, such as respiratory depression, which is responsible for many opioid deaths.It’s with this in mind that Kruegel and a number of his colleagues in the medical field wrote a letter to government officials last week expressing “grave concern” over the DEA’s plan to ban the active substances in kratom. The doctors say these alkaloids could lead to the development of safer alternative pain medications that could help address a nationwide opioid epidemic largely fueled by narcotic painkillers. Furthermore, they claim to have seen little evidence to support the DEA’s dire warnings about kratom’s dangers.“Hundreds of years of human use worldwide further suggest, albeit in an anecdotal manner, that kratom is typically safe, with no substantiated fatal overdoses from kratom plant consumption alone (in contrast to >18,000 deaths per year from prescription opioids and >10,000 from heroin),” they write.This directly challenges the DEA’s description of kratom as an urgent public health threat, a conclusion that relies heavily on a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The CDC study, published in July, found that 660 calls involving kratom were made to U.S. poison centers in the six years from January 2010 to December 2015. It also found evidence of 555 positive drug test results for kratom from December 2014 through March 2016.Although the DEA claims that a sharp upward trend over this period shows “growing abuse and popularity of these substances,” these incidents make up just a tiny portion of the more than 3 million annual calls to poison centers, and of the millions of drug tests the CDC surveyed over that period. For comparison, poison centers gets tens of thousands of calls each year regarding exposure to laundry detergent packets, glow sticks and other plant matter. In 2014, about 57 percent of all poison center cases involved pharmaceuticals. The CDC declined a request for further comment on this study.The DEA also claims there have been “numerous deaths associated with kratom,” but fails to provide an example in which the herb was found to be the only contributor. Such a case does not appear to exist. Most deaths associated with kratom have involved people who reportedly tested positive for numerous substances or were suffering from pre-existing medical conditions. Users report that consuming too much kratom will only lead to nausea and vomiting.Despite the relatively low risk profile, many advocates say they, like the DEA, are worried about emerging brands of “gas station” kratom ― often brightly marked products with stupid names that may be deceptively labeled or contain unlisted adulterants. Before the DEA announced the ban, kratom groups were regularly speaking out in support of regulatory efforts to rein in unscrupulous manufacturers and restrict use by young consumers.The federal government’s move will put an end to such efforts at nuanced regulation. In its notice, the DEA states that “kratom does not have an approved medical use in the United States and has not been studied as a treatment agent.” But that’s pretty much of true of all herbal supplements sold in the U.S. Obtaining official medical approval from the Food and Drug Administration is a lengthy and painstaking process than can cost pharmaceutical companies billions of dollars. And Big Pharma has little incentive to seek approval for plants like kratom, as corporations can’t exactly patent leaves and naturally occurring compounds that have been around for millions of years.None of this is to say that we don’t need further research to get a more complete understanding of the potential health benefits or consequences of taking kratom. In fact, on that there appears to be a consensus from people on all sides of the issue.“In the absence of rigorous, scientific, peer-reviewed clinical studies, DEA is obligated to protect the public and schedule this substance,” said Baer, the agency spokesman.Of course, as scientists like Kruegel have argued, placing kratom in Schedule I is likely to seriously kneecap that undertaking.There are also unanswered questions about how the drug enforcement apparatus will approach a newly criminalized drug. Federal penalties for possession, distribution or manufacture of a Schedule I controlled substance are likely to go into effect almost immediately following the change.This could have broader effects on the criminal justice system, as thousands of Americans will soon be forced to make painful and difficult choices. Many people who use kratom are suffering from chronic pain, and turned to the herb after experiencing negative side effects from prescription opioids, often including addiction. They’ll now have to decide if they want to continue using kratom and risk severe legal consequences. Some may turn back to the painkillers that had previously left them addicted or debilitated. Others may attempt to forgo treatment altogether.Whatever happens, says Grant Smith, Congress will need to play an active role in this decision. After all, Congress gave the DEA the power to make emergency scheduling decisions, and later enhanced that authority as part of legislation meant to address a spate of emerging synthetic drugs.Proponents of progressive criminal justice and drug policy reform now have more sway than ever. For their ranks in Congress to remain silent as the DEA moves unopposed to ramp up the drug war yet again would be a huge mistake, Smith said.“Here we are talking about sentencing reform on Capitol Hill with respect to these older drugs that have been scheduled for a long time, and here comes a drug that is perceived as new, even though it’s not, and we’re applying the same old failed approach of criminalization,” he said. “It’s an unfortunate paradigm. On one hand we’re recognizing that harsh long prison sentences have been counterproductive, but on the other hand you have efforts to continue in this same vein with respect to kratom and some of these other synthetic drugs as well.”This article has been updated with information about a petition asking the White House not to schedule the drug.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

How might that person feel? Terrified? Exhilarated? Humiliated? I know all too well.One month before he left for Rio, I joined Meb Keflezighi, Boston Marathon Champion, New York Marathon winner, Olympic medalist and one of the greatest marathoners of all time, for an “easy run” in Mammoth Lakes, California.“What’s an ‘easy run,’ Meb?”“10 miles.”I can run 10 miles.“What’s the pace?” I ask.“I run based on feel, but probably 6:20-6:30.”I became irrationally optimistic. Meb runs “easy” at about 6:30 per mile. I’ve raced at 6 minutes per mile, so this seemed doable. Not “easy,” per se, but I was confident I could keep up for at least 8 miles.I can do this.“Great! Thanks so much, Meb. I look forward to catching up.”Little did I know how absurd those words would sound later.But in the moment, flush with expectation, all I could see was the image of Meb and me, bounding through the woods of Mammoth like a pair of greyhounds. I picked up the phone to hire a photographer.I am going to frame a poster. It will hang above my desk. I will call it, “Meb and me.”Before I know it, Meb and I are driving up a mountain, en route to our 10-mile run around Lake Mary. I’m in town attending a Westin Escape. He’s there to train at altitude. We’re 9,000 feet above sea level. Meb looks over at me.“How much you weigh?”“171 pounds.”“You’re like a linebacker, man!”I cannot wait to tell my wife this. Meb thinks I’m a linebacker!Meb starts rubbing Tiger Balm on his legs while his longtime mentor, Bob Larsen, watches us with a bike helmet strapped to his head. Bob Larsen is a legend. I feel honored.Does my photographer know Bob? Bob should be in the poster.Meb finishes applying the Tiger Balm, and I ask for some, quickly, before he has time to put it away. He obliges. I’ve used Tiger Balm after many a run, but never before it. This changes everything.Whatever you do today, Meb, I’m going to do too.We’re ready to run. Meb hands Bob his water bottle and picks up his earphones. He pauses and looks at me with a grin, “You’re staying with me, right?”“Yeah. I hope so… I mean I can feel the altitude, but I should be good.”Meb puts the headphones around the side mirror of the rental car.Meb believes in me. I believe in me. Bob tells us to take the first couple miles super easy, then he’ll join us on his bike around the 2 mile mark. Meb nods at Bob’s directions, starts his Epson watch and looks at me with a smile, “All right, man. Let’s go.” He’s always smiling. Until he’s running and then he’s not.Within seconds, Meb’s feet seem to have springs attached to their heels. I feel like an elephant. We’re whizzing through trees. My eyes dart between Meb in front of me and the trail below to avoid tripping on a rock. Every 5 to 10 seconds, Meb’s left or right index finger points down to the ground informing me of an upcoming object. He’s cruising as if running downhill. I run like a piece of cardboard wearing running shoes.Is he a gazelle? Is he actually a gazelle, not a person?Five minutes go by.I can’t breathe. Why are we running so fast already? I am a hippopotamus chasing a cheetah.I do something I said I wouldn’t do and peek at my watch. Surely, we’re going too fast. Bob would want me to tell Meb we’re going too fast.7:45 pace. I shouldn’t have looked. At the one mile mark my Garmin beeps. Our first mile is a 7:48. I mutter some unprintable words and say to Meb, “I’m struggling. I can’t breathe.”Meb laughs a bit.“It’s not about your breathing, buddy! It’s about your legs. Hang in there.”Does the altitude drop to zero after mile 2? Meb is not human.Suddenly, our photographer appears behind a tree, and for a brief second I’m relieved. No matter what else happens, I will appear in my own poster.Mile two beeps on my watch: 7:08. I’m wishing I hadn’t worn a watch. I could have sworn we just ran a sub 5-minute mile. This is a huge mental blow. I silently tell myself to stay with Meb, but a quarter mile later I mutter, “Meb. I’m done, buddy. I’m done.” Meb’s feet are marshmallows and there is a campfire burning in my chest.Meb doesn’t slow down or miss a step. He just nods his head and continues running while the road below him seems to turn into pillows and clouds. I should have been a football player. Maybe an offensive lineman. I head back to the car trying to figure out why I can’t breathe. Shortly after I get there, Meb and Bob are coming toward me for their second loop. Meb grabs his headphones off the side mirror and puts them around his ears. He seems to be running with even less effort than earlier, but somehow more quickly. Bob says from the bike, “Try to get back in there, Chris.” Yes. Get back in, Chris! Fly like an eagle! You just had to warm up. Go. Go. GO!I hop back in and last a whopping 2 more minutes before pulling out yet again, shaking my head in disbelief. Meb went on to run a total of 12 miles that morning because he was feeling good. Meb is far stronger, swifter and smoother in person than he appears on TV. Bill Murray would have really enjoyed watching him run. I finished the workout having run 6 miles, broken up in three heats, punctuated by wheezing and an injured psyche. Meb was about to begin his post-run stretches and drills when he sensed my embarrassment. Like an understanding father, he invited me to join him. We hopped, jumped and skipped. He was patient; he never ridiculed my short run with him despite my attempts to goad him by verbally bashing myself. He had heard enough.“Chris, I used to run through these trails at 6 minute pace no problem. Now? It’s more like 6:30 or 6:45. But it’s no use comparing myself to what I used to be able to do. I try to do the best I can today. And you did the best you could today.”Meb is human. I am human. I did do the best I could today.“Thanks, buddy.”We finished the drills, hopped in the car and the greatest runner I’ve ever run with let me take him out to breakfast along with his wife, three daughters and Bob. It was a morning I’ll savor for the rest of my life. "
40,TRAVEL,How To Afford Travel,"Rebecca Olsen, ContributorFreelance travel writer and photographer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-we-can-afford-to-travel_us_57d2d89ee4b0eb9a57b7a73d,"THE most frequently asked question I get is “how can you afford to travel?”, although it’s usually couched in words like",2016-09-09,"Experiencing a frozen Sylvan Lake in Custer State Park, South Dakota",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d2d98b1600007726c01bed.jpg?ops=crop_0_0_1000_667%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"THE most frequently asked question I get is “how can you afford to travel?”, although it’s usually couched in words like “OMG you must be so rich to travel so much” or “You’re on the road again? Are you guys made of money?”I am lucky that hubby has a great job, which affords us a certain amount of discretionary spending. However, we don’t have a money tree planted in the backyard, and family life with kids can be expensive. We make it work anyway.Here’s how:Make Travel A Financial PrioritySpending money on travel means that we don’t have a lot of money to spend on other things in our lives. We generally buy clothes at Walmart or at consignments stores and only replace things that are completely falling apart or outgrown. The exception would be items of clothing that get used on a VERY regular basis like everyday shoes, outdoor gear that will last for years like polar fleece, or if I find a super good deal at a place like JC Penney. At home, we rarely eat out, and generally avoid buying packaged food (which costs way more than the ingredients would). You’d be surprised how much you can save (and how much healthier you’ll eat) by making your meals from scratch. By only buying things we really need (and not filling our house with “stuff”), we have that little extra to put away for travel.Open A Savings Account For TravelMoney that is out of sight is out of mind. Every pay day, put a little cash aside in a separate savings account to be exclusively spent on travel. Don’t be tempted to dip into this account unless it’s an absolutely emergency! You’ll be surprised how much will add up over a year. If you have a specific trip in mind and know how much it will cost, work out how much you’ll need to save each week/month and make it happen!Search Out The Free StuffIt’s OK to want the occasional splurge for a big ticket attraction like Disneyland, but too many high priced activities will seriously erode your travel dollars. With a little research, you’ll find TONS of free experiences for your family to enjoy. All US National Parks have junior ranger programs that are free (and an annual pass for National Parks is only $80, or free for active duty military). Many state parks, community recreation centers and city museums also have free activities for families. Snow shoeing? You can do that for free in South Dakota. Caving? Free in Oregon. Card making? Free in Kansas City. Art? Free in Omaha. And of course free hiking can be easily found no matter where you go! You’ll have to do a bit of research on your destination before you go to find the freebies, but ‘time spent in recon is never wasted’.If you have an annual pass to a local attraction (for example a museum or zoo), ask about reciprocal entry into similar attractions in the places that you visit. We have received free entry into countless museums during our travels by showing our Omaha Children’s Museum pass at the front desk and asking if they have reciprocal entry.If you’re in the military, always ask if they offer a military discount (but never expect one, or act insulted if they don’t... it’s a privilege, not a right).Book Accommodation WiselyBefore we had kids, we happily frequented backpacker hostels. Now that we’re a family of 4, on road trips (as opposed to camping trips) we generally stay in motels. We’ve found the Best Western chain in the USA to be good value for money. Yes, it completely lacks the local character and charm of that oh so perfect bed and breakfast by the lake. But it’s predictable, generally has a pool for the kids to splash around in after a long day, offers a free breakfast (more on that in the next point), and and you don’t have to worry about tried, cranky kids running around someone’s home and wrecking something. Hotels get bonus points if there’s a bar downstairs to enjoy a drink when the kids are tucked into bed. By sticking with the same chain, we’ve managed to build up points and are rewarded with several free nights each year, along with a free upgrade to a better room most times we stay. If you’re staying in a location for a week or more, or have a large family needing more than one room, AirBnB.com or HomeAway.com are great ways to find cheaper accommodation and it will often be a fully self contained apartment or house so you can cook your own food.Eat The Free BreakfastLife on the road away from a kitchen means eating out... a lot. The cost of restaurants can really add up over the course of a long trip, but there are ways that you can minimize this cost as much as possible, even if you’re not staying somewhere with a kitchen. When booking hotels, choose one that has a free full breakfast, and make breakfast your largest meal of the day. You want to be well and truly full by the end of the meal. Grab a coffee and sweet treat on your way out so you’re not tempted to stop at the cafe down the road in an hour. Often these hotel breakfasts will also have whole fruit like apples and bananas in a bowl. Grab one for each member of the family - that’s your afternoon snack. When we’re on the road, we only eat two meals a day - breakfast in the hotel and one other main meal somewhere around 3-4pm. When the munchies strike at other times, we’ll stop at a playground somewhere and eat the fruit we took from breakfast, or things like muesli bars, yoghurt, salads, cheese and crackers that we bought at a local grocery store. A small esky/cooler in the car can keep things like yoghurt nice and cold and won’t take up too much room. Just remember to pop the ice bricks in the freezer of your hotel each night.Do you have other tips? Let me know in the comments below!"

His camp released another TV ad yesterday (9/7/16) posing the rhetorical question, “Are we really talking about this?” The question came on the coattails of his claim that while he was “busy raising average teacher pay, creating new jobs and cutting taxes, other folks were actually pushing to make our schools allow boys to use the girls’ locker rooms and showers.”Yes, Pat. I’m going to go ahead and answer your rhetorical question. We are still talking about this – a conversation that you began.McCrory actually has a captive, scrutinizing audience with me because I happen to both have experience with the public school system, where he falsely persuades North Carolinians to think he has been raising teacher pay averages (but what he doesn’t say is that his “teacher pay average” averages in all school staff, including administration), and also, I’m the parent of a little boy who wears dresses. So I’m listening, Pat. You’re talking directly to me. And yes, I will continue to “really talk about this” - the conversation that you started.While McCrory’s latest ads and interviews seem to be slyly excluding the phrasing about multiple occupancy public restrooms, referring instead mostly to locker rooms and shower facilities, “the bathroom bill” is still the underlying theme playing on the fears of the uninformed. Lest we forget, when they made HB2 into law a few months back, McCrory and his people dubbed it “The Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, officially called An Act to Provide for Single-sex Multiple Occupancy Bathroom and Changing Facilities in Schools and Public Agencies” aka, “The Bathroom Bill.”Just this summer, at a town hall meeting in Cary, NC on August 26, McCrory said, “I don’t think our principals and our superintendents should be subjected to allowing a boy who thinks he’s a girl, but is still a boy, to be able to enter a locker room shower or bathroom facility. It’s a respectful disagreement, but it’s not a disagreement that I should be disrespected for having.”I’ll just leave that one alone. Kick it around in your brain for a while and you’ll get a headache.On July 22, the NBA announced its decision to pull the 2017 All-Star game out of North Carolina in protest of HB2. To this, McCrory responded on a talk-radio show, “I strongly disagree with their decision. To put it bluntly, it’s total P.C.B.S. … it’s an insult to our city, and an insult to our state.” He further announced that he believes the NBA is practicing “selective outrage.”One could take this in many directions, but probably the worst part is where McCrory declares that transgender people wanting equal rights is analogous with being “politically correct.” He questions, “does the desire to be politically correct outweigh our children’s privacy and safety?” Well, Pat, it’s actually not political correctness to believe that LGBTQ+ youth shouldn’t be bullied at school. It’s not political correctness to believe that we should offer these kids protections that we would expect all of our kids to have. Besides, federal court has already ruled that HB2 violates federal law, and has since blocked UNC from enforcing provisions. Hell, even the Governor can’t enforce his law in his own mansion, as I know of at least one transgender female advocate who has recently used the Ladies Room there in plain sight of security guards with no issue.People are leaving the state in droves because of Governor McCrory. I’m choosing to stay put. I will not let this man chase me out of my beloved home state. I’m staying to see him led out of office and replaced by someone who can begin to repair and restore the state that I love so much. I’d also like to address McCrory directly. Lord knows I’ve already sent enough e-mails that go unanswered, so, what the heck? I’ll just focus my energy blogging about it instead. So, here goes:Pat McCrory, I am sickened by your continued use of phrases like “a boy who thinks he’s a girl, but is still a boy,” or this notion you keep implanting of boys in dresses, a notion that severely undermines transgender and gender non-conforming people. Pat, allow me to direct you to a little education. We’ll call it Transgender 101. Lesson one is simple: Transgender girls are girls. They are not “boys in dresses.” But to really understand transgender people, or Native American “two-spirit” people, or gender non-conforming people is much deeper than that. We’ll save that for another day. Right now, the issue I have with raising a young, impressionable, gender non-conforming boy, is why do you feel the need to use this notion of “boys in dresses” ad nauseam ?” Why not “girls in pants?” I’ll tell you why not. Because the assumption of blockheads like you, Pat, is that ALL boys are predators, and women are meek, lowly figures who need protection at all costs, especially in public restrooms and locker room facilities.My husband and I were blessed with one of each type of child: a cisgender (meaning biological sex assigned at birth and sex they identify with jives) 16-year-old male, a cisgender 14-year-old female, and a gender non-conforming 10-year-old boy who prefers all things sparkly, pink, frilly, and soft. He is on a journey right now. In fact, he has been all of his life. He is sorting through his gender identity and right now he identifies as neither male nor female, but some combination of both. It’s a notion I wouldn’t expect you to understand (I can hear you right now saying, “bless his heart, he’s so confused”) but actually, my husband and I see this as a gift, and so does he. There is no confusion. Regardless, because he’s a gender-bender, my son is actually one of those “boys in dresses” that you keep taunting, and I’d like you to know that he is the exact opposite of a predator. Anyone who knows my son will vouch for his peaceful, loving, accepting spirit, and avoidance of confrontation. In fact, with this climate you’ve recently created, he’s so scared for his own safety right now that he doesn’t even use either restroom in public. He looks for gender neutral, or family bathrooms so that he can avoid confrontation of any kind.I promise you, Pat, when my gender non-conforming child actually works up his nerve to wear one of his beloved dresses in public, HE is the one who has to fear for his safety. Because you, Governor McCrory, are only interested in protecting a minuscule fraction of society (women whom you perceive as needing some sort of predator protection in public accommodations), you don’t protect the greater good; you don’t seem to understand that a transgender man who opts not to have bottom surgery (that means having a penis built onto his body), but for all intents and purposes looks and dresses exclusively male on the outside, is now guaranteed to be in the women’s restroom, because he was born without a penis. A very masculine looking man going into the women’s room, because that’s what this law actually looks like. Let that sink in. I give a sarcastic slow clap in your general direction for managing to vote IN to law exactly what you were trying to vote OUT of law.McCrory, you have hand-fed the very ignorant monsters who perpetuate this perverted predator in the restroom myth. YOUR people are the dangerous people. Not this notion of boys in dresses. Boys in dresses are not yet the same thing as transgender girls, but they’re still in some stage of transformation. Boys who wear dresses in public (which is, yet again, different than “drag queens,” or “cross-dressers,” - refer back to Transgender 101, basic vocabulary) are some of the bravest, fiercest, most sincere souls walking this earth. Do you have ANY idea how much bravery it takes for a young boy to wear a dress in public? It takes balls of steel, and I’m not sure how much more “manly” it gets than that.Pat, YOUR people are the monsters, the predators. YOUR people are the ones to fear, the ones who would laugh at, question, or have a physical altercation with my young son, or me, or his dad, because he chooses to wear a dress. And this isn’t even happening in public bathrooms. The damage he endures happens out in public, in broad daylight.Pat, you have no idea what you’re doing. You are completely blind to the irony of the situation you have created, when just months ago, no one was the wiser, and transgender people peed beside cisgender people all along. Also, this scare tactic you’re using just doesn’t work. The psychological profile does not fit. First of all, the type of man who would be so sick as to sexually assault children is more often than not a person known to and trusted by the family. Not a stranger in the bathroom. These horrific incidents happen after months, years even, of a sexual predator who has groomed and earned the family’s trust and the child’s adoration. Someone like a scout leader, martial arts teacher, church leader, or even a beloved uncle. That’s who is committing these crimes. Not a stranger in the bathroom. Focus on that. Secondly, the psychological profile does not fit the type of cisgender, straight man you are talking about, the one you are assuming would “dress up like a transgender woman to enter the women’s room in order to sexually assault a woman.” The type of man who would sexually assault a woman in the first place is a man who, at his very core, has a deep-seated, intense hatred of women. He would never “stoop” to the level of dressing like a woman and going out in public as a woman, even if it was a means to achieve his sick purpose. This type of man hates women so much that he would never be caught dead posing as one. And to further prove that point, there are zero incidents that have ever occurred because a man decided to slap on a dress in order to sexually assault or even peep in women’s stalls. Finally, one last point. Despite your law, which is completely unenforceable to begin with, sexual assault, and “peeping” in bathrooms are totally separate issues, and are still a crime, regardless of who’s doing it.My husband and I cannot flush you and your legacy down the toilet fast enough.#WeAreNotThisOriginally published at www.gendercreativelife.com"

Your ‘type’ changes drastically as time goes by. Especially in your mid to late twenties. You start looking for deeper and more solid qualities like responsibility, honesty and integrity instead of someone you can just have fun with. You begin to appreciate a partner you can talk to about meaningful things, about your problems, about your family and about your work because as you grow up, the things that matter to you change drastically too.2. Finding the right career is more important than getting married. Finding the right career for you is the most rewarding gift you can give yourself. It will give you something to look forward to and will always motivate you to grow and learn new things. It will make you a better person and a happier person and you will not have to depend on love to make you happy.3. Modern dating sucks but it really teaches you a lot. Modern dating sucks but with every dating disaster that happens to you, you learn one more thing about yourself and about the person you are looking for. You also learn how to love yourself and you learn that sometimes you have to choose being alone instead of being with someone who is not treating you right or someone who doesn’t want to define the relationship.4. Invest in a few good friends. Your friends will be your support system forever. The better friends you have, the easier your life will be. Good friends will get you through almost anything in life. Pick them wisely and you will always find someone to lean on when life gets rough. They will be your main backbone.5. Don’t settle. Don’t date someone just because you’ve been single for so long or because all your friends are married. Don’t stay in a relationship that is not good for you because it’s comfortable and don’t hold on to someone who doesn’t love you the way you deserve to be loved.6. You have to know who you are before getting married. Getting married when you’re in an unsteady place in your life makes you count on the relationship as the main source of your happiness and makes you follow your partner’s footsteps without stopping to ask yourself if this is what you really want.7. Kids are not the answer. Having kids does not mean you secured a spot in marriage paradise, if anything, it’s the ultimate test to determine how strong the marriage is. People who have kids when they’re not ready are really just setting their marriage up for disaster.8. You will not ‘lose’ your married friends. I think this is the biggest misconception – that you will not be talking to your friends who got married. Once they get past the honeymoon phase, everything will be back to normal and they will still be a phone call away.9. You can make things happen alone. You can get your dream job or buy that house or travel to this country without anyone’s help or approval. When you are growing up without being committed to someone, you truly have the world in your hands and you can just do whatever you want and you can become whoeveryou want. Being independent is a wonderful thing that will make you rich in so many ways. In this day and age, being single is actually a privilege — depending on the way you look at it.10. Marriage is also not the answer. I mentioned earlier that kids are not the answer but marriage is not the answer either. If you didn’t learn to find your happiness alone, you won’t find it in your marriage, if you didn’t learn to love yourself when you’re single, you won’t love yourself when you’re married, if you didn’t find yourself before marriage, you won’t find yourself after marriage.People are told that marriage is what makes them complete but the truth is nothing can complete someone but themselves, their experiences, their passions, their hearts, their intelligence and their strength.Learn more about the author of this post Rania Naim by following her on Facebook here.Read more from Thought Catalog:The Search For Something More: A Guide For Those Trying To Heal Themselves10 Stunning Haruki Murakami Quotes That Will Make You Think And Feed Your Soul At The Same TimeHow To Ruin Your Life (Without Even Noticing That You Are)Follow us on Instagram: Thought Catalog"
