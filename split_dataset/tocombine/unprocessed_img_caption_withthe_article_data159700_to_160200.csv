Our choices don't make us better or worse than another mom, they just make us different.The commitment to be a mother is awe-inspiring to me. It makes me look at other mothers with pride and camaraderie. Why do we need to be mothers in the same way? Why can't we all make choices that are best for our families?Maybe we can put down this constant judgement and adopt an attitude of curiosity. Instead of assuming what is best for each family, let us be open to the choices we all make. Let us support each other.Parenting is the most challenging and gratifying roles of our lives. If your parenting style and work schedule works for you and your family, then I say bravo to you. Would you please extend the same courtesy to me?As mothers, our love for our children never changes. The expression of that love changes with time and with circumstances. Instead of approaching each other from a place of judgement, insecurity and guilt, why don't we approach each other with love and support.Let us not assume that a choice, any choice, invalidates our priority to be the best mothers we can. My mother who has adult children and teenage grandchildren, still considers herself a ""full-time mom."" During her life, she has worked no-time, part-time and full-time. At no time did I think that my brother and I were not her top priority. My own daughters have seen me work hard at building my business, and I hope that I have inspired them to follow their own dreams and inspirations.I met a mother recently who said to me that she was a ""full-time mom"" implying that I was not since I work full-time. To that I say, is there a way to be anything but a ""full-time"" mom? We are all full-time moms, just because we work full-time does not make us part-time moms.

That's certainly true for Gerry Leary of Boulder, Colorado. Leary has been blind since birth, yet he operates a successful coffee roasting business and a café near Boulder's main pedestrian mall, Pearl Street. Leary learned to roast coffee by gauging the sound and smell of the beans, and his sense of coffee taste is second to none. He's honed his sensibility to a fine point, and has become a supreme connoisseur and master craftsman. ""There are other ways to take in your world beyond sight,"" he says. ""You have to be open, and you have to adapt."" The mechanics of operating a coffee roaster are hardly beyond Gerry's abilities. He operated a car-repair shop in Boulder for nearly 20 years after learning the trade from his father. ""Basically you'd hear people say, 'a blind mechanic?' Sometimes people would just show up to watch,"" he told an advocacy newsletter for the blind in 2006. ""In all my time of working on cars, I may have had a handful of unhappy customers."" But the coming of computerized car systems meant that Leary needed a new profession. He couldn't interpret the diagnostic codes in the guidebook. Leary had started looking for a coffee roasting mentor years earlier, during a vacation to San Francisco. ""Everyone I talked to said, 'Boy, you really have to see to do this. I don't know how to teach you.' One person said I'd never be able to roast coffee."" But despite those long odds, he got his certification as a master coffee roaster and started experimenting in a backyard shed at his house. It was frustrating at first, but he had a breakthrough when he found a talking thermometer that could allow him to take temperature measurements. Things moved quickly after that, and Leary's coffee became so popular that he needed an industrial space. His business, ""The Unseen Bean,"" which offered ""Blind Roasted Coffee,"" was born, with a logo featuring Leary's guide Labrador, Midnight, wearing sunglasses while he sniffs a cup of coffee. A decade later, the business is still going strong. Leary hand-roasts coffee from more than a dozen countries, including rare locales like Malawi and Zambia, listening for ""audible cues"" as the beans release water during the roasting process. He tries to buy organic, fair-trade beans, and has created many custom blends for his loyal patrons. ""People hate spending money repairing their cars,"" he says, ""but with coffee, they come in and leave with a smile. It's a much happier work environment."" Since Leary started his business, there's been a worldwide explosion in artisanal coffee. You can't throw a bean without hitting a trendy barista. But a nearly 60-year-old guy, blind since birth, is still out-roasting and out-brewing the best of them. ""The competition's fun,"" he says, ""because I think I can make better coffee than they can."" Leary has turned an apparent disadvantage into an edge up. The proof is in the smell, the sound, and the taste of his blind-roasted coffee. This video from Dark Rye was produced by Ira Chute and edited by Jason De La Rosa."

But with the baby boomer generation retiring and an estimated 32 million Americans getting insured through the Affordable Care Act, projections estimate that as many as 130,000 new physicians will be needed by 2025. What are the standards for becoming a doctor? First, a student has to get into a medical school, whose requirements can vary. At the least, an applicant must have completed science courses and a bachelor's from an accredited university, as well as scoring at least a 30 on the medical college admission test (MCAT). Though the number is low, the variation of admittance based on scores in 2011 was tight: The average MCAT score, which helped admit 20,000 students, was 31.1. That leaves little room for error, for both the students and the health of U.S. hospitals. By 2020, forecasters anticipate employment opportunities for doctors to grow 24 percent. Staffing agencies like Soliant Health are already working hard to connect existing doctors to hospital demand, which, based on economic and policy predictions, will only get stronger.

Like all foods, some love it and some hate it. And even among the ranks of spicy food lovers, some can only tolerate a dash or two of Tabasco while others head over to their local wing joint weekly for their XXXX-Mindkiller Special.Click here to see the World's Spiciest Hot SaucesFor those of you in the latter group, like these guys, this list is for you. We tracked down the absolute spiciest hot sauces out there, ranked them according to Scoville units (the way spiciness is measured), and provided you with ways to order them directly to your door. But be careful: these sauces are spicy (Scoville Units are measured through a complicated dilution process; for example, a pepper whose extract needs to be diluted 10,000 times before capsaicin is undetectible will have a rating of 10,000 Scoville Units.)Check out Which Chain Has the Cheapest WingsFor a bit of perspective, let's take a look at the hot sauce standard-bearer: Tabasco. The original version of the popular hot sauce contains at most about 5,000 Scoville units, about as many as you'd find in your average jalapeño. On the other end of the spectrum, Guinness World Records proclaims that the world's hottest chile pepper is the Trinidad Scorpion ""Butch T,"" which clocks in at a whopping 1,463,700 Scoville units, nearly 300 times hotter than a jalapeño.Click here to see 10 Vintage Lunch Boxes Worth Big BucksFor the chile lovers out there, however, there's no such thing as too spicy, and hot sauce producers keep finding more and more ways to pack as much capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot sauce, into their products. Just to give you an idea as to how spicy hot sauces have gotten recently, the original super-spicy hot sauce, Dave's Insanity Sauce, which came onto the scene about 20 years ago and sparked a hot sauce boom, clocks in at about 180,000 Scoville units -- it didn't even scratch the surface of our top 10 list!So why do hot sauces keep getting hotter and hotter? To answer that question, we went to Scott Roberts, a St. Louis-based blogger and self-proclaimed ""chile-head,"" who's been on a quest to track down the world's hottest sauces for about 10 years.""The extreme chile-heads are clamoring for more and more and more heat,"" he told us. ""Throughout the 2000s there was a 'hot sauce race,' when everybody was trying to make the hottest product. They started to use chile extracts to boost the heat, and the advent of super-hot chile peppers has allowed the sauce makers to make their sauces hotter and hotter. It brings real notoriety if you make one of the hottest sauces on Earth, and even more if you can eat it!""- Dan Myers, The Daily MealMore from The Daily Meal: America's Unhealthiest Fast Food World's 10 Coolest McDoanld's Check out the World's Strangest McDonald's Commercials 101 Best Restaurants in America for 2013"

6,WELLNESS,Spring Cleaning Our Lives,"Christian de la Huerta, Contributor

Spring cleaning our lives, however, is not so easy. It requires a strong desire to let go of the old and perhaps the comfortable, that which no longer serves.",2013-03-24,"Female hand with daisy flower with one petal left on it, background of summer meadow.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf2d82000003100fdc68b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Spring is here officially, for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere.Spring cleaning is a time-honored and, one could even say, natural ritual. After months of accumulating food and extra pounds for protection during the harsh and unpredictable winter months, spring is a time to lighten up the load. These days it usually means getting rid of extra stuff, a way to start fresh and make space for the new, just as life starts bursting forth from dormancy. For most of us, spring cleaning our physical space is not so challenging. Spring cleaning our lives, however, is not so easy. It requires a strong desire to let go of the old and perhaps the comfortable, that which no longer serves. It calls for the courage and willingness to take a harsh, realistic look at our lives and our current situations.What thoughts and beliefs are we still holding on to that are tired and have outgrown their usefulness?  What about our living situation? Does it help our spirit soar and encourage creativity, or does it tax our nervous system and depress us, hindering our self-expression? Our physical space is a reflection of our inner landscape. For some, that's the bad -- maybe even scary -- news. The good news, though, is that if we clear up the outer clutter, the resulting clarity and lightness will also be reflected in the inner world. What makes this difficult for many is that it requires the willingness to let go of the past, and perhaps the illusion of security that our accumulated stuff can represent. Yet having the courage to part ways with the old frees up our minds and opens up space for the fresh and new.Are our current relationships a match for who we are and who we are becoming? Which of them support the highest vision of ourselves and our greatest potential, and which might be keeping us playing small, in a slowly and increasingly suffocating comfort zone?One way to think about our relationships is using the image of a co-op garden. Voltaire ended his book Candide with this exhortation: ""We must cultivate our garden."" That's the work we do to heal ourselves, identifying our own wounded areas and doing whatever we need to do to bring about healing, whether that is using therapy, breathwork, bodywork or any other healing modality.The co-op garden symbolizes the mutual space we have to be authentic and real with each other, a safe space for full and easeful self-expression. Both parties are responsible for maintaining that space. Anytime we lie or withhold something, for example, it's as if a weed takes hold of and colonizes a corner of that garden. And we know how fast weeds grow. If left unattended, pretty soon we run out of space for clear and honest communication. That's what suffocates our relationships.What communications do we need to make to keep our co-op garden clear? Are there any unfulfilled promises that need to be completed or unchosen, and that communication made to the other party?As summer approaches, this is also a good time to reevaluate our diet and exercise plans. Not much need be said about that; the multilevel benefits, not only in terms of our health but also in the quality of our lives, are proven and well established. We know this.And then, of course, is right livelihood, one of the aspects of Buddha's eightfold path. Is our work a congruent reflection of who we are, an expression of our essential self and our soul's calling? If it is not, have we made a conscious choice about allowing that to be OK as a means to pay the bills, and are we still finding the time to give expression to our deepest longings and sense of purpose? Therein lies our fulfillment, and the possibility of inner peace.To make this all real for ourselves, we might consider creating a release and purification ritual, to help highlight the choices we are making. This could involve fire, or releasing something appropriate -- and biodegradable, of course -- at the ocean's side, or offering it in burial back to the earth.Whatever you do, may spring be filled with the promise of new life and with countless blessings!For more by Christian de la Huerta, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

The 16-year-old was shot to death on a Brooklyn street last Saturday night by plainclothes police officers who claim the youth pointed a .38-caliber revolver at them. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baddbab200000e500ff224a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- On Saturday, inside the mahogany wood and white stone sanctuary at St. Catherine of Genoa Catholic Church, no one spoke openly about the New York Police Department’s impact on the church's East Flatbush neighborhood in Brooklyn.No one mentioned the controversial tactic, formally called ""stop-question-and-frisk,"" and its possible impact on police community relations in the neighborhood. No one talked about what it has done to alter the lives of the nearly 5 million people -- the overwhelming majority of whom are black or Latino -- citywide who have been stopped and frisked.No one had to.  At the church’s altar, Kimani Gray, a 16-year-old known by the nickname ""Kiki"" whose favorite subject in school was English because he “loved the power of words,” lay silent and still inside a coffin, beneath a bone and gold embroidered pall.To the right of the casket, sat Gray’s parents, family and friends, as well as the emergency medical crew called when Gray’s mother fainted and nearly fell to the church floor. Later, one of Gray’s brothers had to be restrained inside the sanctuary when he said loudly that an unidentified man should not have been there because the man did not know who Kiki was.  Gray’s eulogy reminded those inside the sanctuary that in the days leading up to his death Gray, a self-described writer, was busy working on a dramatic piece. On weekdays, he traveled more than an hour each way to his Manhattan high school. His affection for Chinese food, the television show “Supernatural,” and the music of teenage rapper Chief Keef were so well known that their mention Saturday moved most of the nearly 200 people gathered inside St. Catherine’s to laugh.  Two weeks after Gray’s shooting death, exactly what happened remains the subject of an NYPD internal investigation. Police say that when plain-clothes officers jumped out of a car, and ordered Gray and a group of teenagers on their way to a Sweet 16 party to stop for questioning, Gray pointed a weapon at the officers. Police fired, killing Gray. Witnesses say that Gray was unarmed, and attempting to adjust his baggy pants and possibly flee when he was shot. An autopsy found that some of the seven bullets that pierced Gray entered the back of his body. The March 9 shooting seems to have drawn new national attention to a collection of police tactics used nationwide, including stop and frisk, and random traffic stops to initiate vehicle searches or warrant checks. Proponents insist the tactics are proactive policing tools that help identify criminals and stop crime before it occurs. Opponents insist they provide legal cover for racial profiling and abuses of authority that turn minority neighborhoods into police states.   Gray’s death also ignited a series of clashes with police that New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has said were prematurely and inaccurately reported as riots. The confrontations led to a series of arrests and a make-shift sidewalk memorial for Gray near the spot where he was shot. Neither Kelly nor New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a proponent of stop and frisk, attended the funeral.  On Saturday, the NYPD stationed police cruisers with flashing lights along streets near St. Catherine’s. At least 35 police officers stood behind stacks of portable metal barricades at the church or were aboard scooters scattered between the church and the site of the shooting less than a mile away.   For Jose LaSalle, an activist who is among a small group keeping vigil at the spot where Gray was shot, the service made him think of his own teenage son.  In 2011, when LaSalle’s son was 15, he was stopped and frisked in East Harlem. A radio recording of one of the officers involved is expected to be introduced into evidence this month in a federal case evaluating the constitutionality of stop and frisk, said LaSalle. The boy was too afraid to testify, his father said, but the recording captured one of the officers who frisked him calling the boy “a mutt.”  ""A mutt, like a mixed breed dog,"" said LaSalle. ""He said that like Spanish people, you know because of our mixed heritage, are not even full human beings. That's what boys like my son, parents like me face if we are lucky. My son is alive."""

Driven by her own struggles with seizures, Cassidy began the campaign in order to stimulate awareness and create an international community of support for those who are dealing with trauma associated with this disorder. The Anita Kaufmann Foundation, the global sponsor for Purple Day, reports that ""epilepsy affects more than two million Americans and more than 65 million worldwide. One in 26 people in the United States alone will develop epilepsy at some point in their lifetime."" Debra Josephs, the Executive Director of the nonprofit group, says that ""many people living with epilepsy still face barriers dues to a lack of knowledge about the disorder."" The goal of their four-year-old initiative, The Great Purple Cupcake Project, is to partner with individuals and organizations around the world to promote epilepsy awareness. While not everyone may be driven to run a 5K race to support an organization, or walk 100 miles to raise funds for another, everyone is capable of buying a cupcake. Monies go directly to educational programs. These include a start-up called Heads Up for Vets, specifically created to help veterans who can develop post-traumatic epilepsy from sustained brain injuries. Many vets return home and experience difficulties but do not realize they are having seizures. This year, pastry shops and famous bakeries everywhere will make lavender-iced cupcakes to support the cause. It is their way of giving back and educating the public about a condition that affects so many. In New York, all the Fairway Markets are participating, as well as celebrity ""Cake Boss"" Buddy Valastro from the wildly popular Carlos Bakery in Hoboken; New York's Two Little Red Hens, hundreds of bakeries in New Jersey, and also pastry shops in Malaysia, Indonesia, Zambia, the UK, Australia, and India will join in.

Photo caption (right): ""Cake Boss"" Buddy Valastro shows his support of The Great Purple Cupcake Project.A joint resolution passed this March 21st by the New Jersey legislature requests Governor Chris Christie to designate March 26th ""Purple Day"" as the official epilepsy awareness day in New Jersey. The proclamation encourages private citizens, public officials, community-based organizations, governmental agencies, and businesses to wear purple on that day to show support for people living with the disorder. These proclamations are popping up around the U.S., including Pennsylvania, Colorado, Utah, Montana, and Ohio. While Purple Day is specifically commemorated on March 26th, during the weeks of March 23rd and April 9th, local bakeries will be offering their own personal riffs on purple cupcakes and encourage their communities to participate. The mission is simple: to educate the public not to fear epilepsy and to learn the simple steps of what to do when someone has a seizure. Like any grass roots movement, individuals are also supporting this cause by baking purple cupcakes and selling them everywhere. When you buy a cupcake you get a seizure first-aid bookmark. It is claimed that one out of ten people will have a seizure and most people don't know what to do.Painting your nails purple is also encouraged. OPI Products, Inc. a leading nail polish company is a supporter, and this year Purple Day will be the cause célèbre on AOL's homepage. The Canadian Parliament, in June 2012, designated March 26th every year as Purple Day, encouraging Canadians to wear purple to show their support for people with epilepsy. Why is all of this important? Because it tells us that an eight-year old can change the world... one cupcake at a time.

In fact, as Krugman sees it, the right-wing bloggers are the ones acting hypocritical in this case by “attacking success” after they told everyone to lay off the super-rich during the 2012 presidential campaign. “These guys don’t actually believe in any rules at all,” Krugman wrote. “Whatever rule they may lay down in one case, they’ll break in an instant if they think they see an advantage.”Conservatives have seized on Yglesias’ $1.2 million condo buy largely because they believe his past support for some form of wealth redistribution implies that he doesn’t believe anyone should own private property. But that interpretation skews Yglesias’ argument, New York Magazine’s Jonathan Chait writes: His argument about ownership does not imply that nobody should own anything. It merely implies that people don’t have a right to the entirety of their market income so absolute it makes redistribution immoral. And as the Atlantic's Elspeth Reeve argues, advocating that rich people should pay higher taxes and then buying an expensive condo doesn’t constitute hypocrisy. Yglesias would “be a hypocrite if he opened a P.O. box in Florida to avoid paying some income taxes,” Reeve writes. It’s also worth noting that the conservative blogosphere may have honed in on the wrong target in this case. While Yglesias has advocated for raising taxes on the rich as  a  way to boost funding for public services, he doesn’t think it should necessarily be the go-to solution. In addition, he even offered a sort-of defense of Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s low tax rate, writing in September that many economists agree that capital income, which accounts for much of Romney’s wealth, should be taxed “more lightly than labor income.”"

The talk was of bailouts, Europe and betrayal.""We had the impression that being part of Europe would be a good thing, that it would solve our problems,"" said Chris Kikas, whose business selling hand painted religious icons has seen better days. ""Well, it's not like that at all,"" he said. ""Where is the solidarity?""The island of 1.1 million people, for years a haven for big offshore finance, rich Russians and sun-seeking British expats, has been stunned by the pace of the unfolding drama that has left them staring at the prospect of financial meltdown.Only a month ago they elected conservative leader Nicos Anastasiades as president on a mandate to secure a bailout that would stave off default and shore up banks crippled by their exposure to Greece, the epicentre of Europe's stubborn debt crisis.On Sunday, Anastasiades was locked in talks with Cyprus's partners in the 17-nation euro zone, still short of the billions of euros they want before signing off on a 10 billion euro rescue package to keep the island economically afloat.Shops, traditionally closed on Sundays, were open in the hope of attracting enough customers to kickstart the slow trade of the last few weeks.But with bank doors closed for a week already, one mobile phone store had pinned a sign in its window that read, ""Cash only - until the financial situation is resolved.""

Unsold textile rolls, a metre for one euro, were stacked high outside on the cobbled street. Papapavlou said business was down 90 percent.Cyprus has escaped the bouts of angry street violence that frequently erupt in Greece. But peaceful protests have become a daily occurrence. On Sunday, around 200 bank workers, some of whom face losing their jobs, gathered outside the presidential palace chanting ""Troika out of Cyprus!"" and ""Cyprus not for sale!""'Troika' has become a dirty word in the euro zone's debt-laden southern states, referring as it does to the trio of lenders - the EU, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund - demanding strict austerity in return for economic salvation.Many Greeks, Italians or Cypriots say the medicine is worse than the sickness.Cypriots were outraged last weekend to learn that they would have to take a hit on their personal bank deposits to raise 5.8 billion euros in return for the country's 10 billion euro bailout. They besieged bank machines.""The banks will reopen on Tuesday, but will there be any money left in them for people to withdraw?"" asked Vlasa Cyprian, a 35-year-old petrol pump attendant. ""I don't think so,"" he said, ""and if there is, there'll be little, very little.""The proposed levy, thrown out by lawmakers panicked by the visceral reaction of their voters, now targets big savers over 100,000 euros, many of them Russians and other foreigners who squirreled their money away in the country's over-sized banks on the kind of favourable terms unseen elsewhere in the EU.Cyprus now faces a Monday deadline to seal the bailout, or the European Central Bank says it will sever emergency funding to the island's stricken banks. Talks in Brussels were set to drag on late into the night.Whatever the outcome, Cypriots will see little reason for cheer.

There was no official confirmation.EU diplomats said the president was still fighting to preserve the country's business model as an offshore financial centre that drew huge funds from wealthy Russians and Britons.The key issues in dispute were how Cyprus should raise 5.8 billion euros from its banking sector towards its own financial rescue, and how to restructure its outsized banks.The Cypriot government and political parties remain divided, and late night talks in Nicosia broke up early on Sunday without a result after angry bank workers demonstrated to save their jobs.Anastasiades, flown to Brussels in a private jet by the European Commission, held several hours of negotiations before a crunch meeting of euro zone finance ministers which, five hours after it was supposed to start, had still not been convened.A Cypriot government spokesman said earlier the president and his team had a ""very difficult task to accomplish to save the Cypriot economy and avert a disorderly default"".The EU's economic affairs chief Olli Rehn said there were no good options but ""only hard choices left"" for the latest casualty of the euro zone crisis.With banks closed for the last week, the Central Bank of Cyprus imposed a 100-euros per day limit on withdrawals from cash machines at the two biggest banks to avert a run.French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici rejected charges that the EU had brought Cypriots to their knees, saying it was the island's offshore business model that had failed.""To all those who say that we are strangling an entire people ... Cyprus is a casino economy that was on the brink of bankruptcy,"" he told Canal Plus television.Analysts say failure to clinch a deal could cause a wider financial market selloff, but some say the island's small size - it accounts for just 0.2 percent of the euro zone's economic output - means contagion would be limited.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said there had been little progress since last weekend's attempted bailout deal involving a levy on all bank deposits, which the Cypriot parliament overwhelmingly rejected, but he hoped people in Cyprus now had ""a somewhat realistic view of the situation"".Schaeuble said the financial numbers had worsened, if anything, in the intervening week. Asked what a solution would look like, he said: ""What we agreed last week.""The levy on bank deposits represents an unprecedented step in Europe's handling of a debt crisis that has spread from Greece, to Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy.ANXIOUS MOODIn the Cypriot capital, Nicosia, the mood was anxious.""I haven't felt so uncertain about the future since I was 13 and Cyprus was invaded,"" said Dora Giorgali, 53, a nursery teacher who lost her job two years ago when the school she worked at closed down.""I have two children studying abroad and I tell them not to return to Cyprus. Imagine a mother saying that,"" she said in a central Nicosia square. ""I think a solution will be found tonight but it won't be in the best interests of our country.""Cyprus's banking sector, with assets eight times the size of its economy, has been crippled by exposure to crisis-hit Greece.Without a deal by the end of Monday, the ECB says it will cut off emergency funds to the banks, spelling certain collapse and potentially pushing the country out of the euro.Conservative leader Anastasiades, barely a month in office and wrestling with Cyprus' worst crisis since a 1974 invasion by Turkish forces split the island in two, has been forced to back down on his efforts to shield big account holders.""Negotiations continue. We are doing our utmost for #Cyprus,"" he tweeted from Brussels.Scrambling to find the funds, officials said Cyprus had conceded to a one-time levy on bank deposits over 100,000 euros, a dramatic U-turn from five days ago when lawmakers threw out a similar proposal as ""bank robbery"".A senior Cypriot official said Nicosia had agreed with its lenders on a 20 percent levy on deposits of more than 100,000 euros at the island's largest lender, Bank of Cyprus, and four percent on deposits above that level at other banks.Anticipating a run when banks reopen on Tuesday, parliament has given the government powers to impose capital controls.PARLIAMENTAbout 200 Cypriot bank employees protested outside the presidential palace on Sunday chanting ""troika out of Cyprus"" and ""Cyprus will not become a protectorate"".In a stunning vote on Tuesday, the 56-seat parliament rejected a levy on depositors, big and small. Finance Minister Michael Sarris then spent three fruitless days in Moscow trying to win help from Russia, whose citizens and companies have billions of euros at stake in Cypriot banks.Rebuffed by the Kremlin, he said the levy was back ""on the table"".On Friday, lawmakers voted to nationalise pension funds and split failing lenders into good and bad banks - a measure likely to be applied to the second-biggest lender, the largely state-owned Cyprus Popular Bank, also known as Laiki.Cypriot media reports suggested talks were stuck on a demand by the IMF that Bank of Cyprus absorb the good assets of Popular Bank and take on its nine billion euros debt to the central bank as well.The plan to tap pension funds had been shelved, a senior Cypriot official told Reuters, due to German opposition.It was far from certain that a majority of lawmakers would back a revised levy, or whether the government might even try to bypass the assembly.Cypriot leaders had initially tried to spread the pain between big holdings and smaller depositors, fearing the damage it would inflict on the country as an offshore financial haven for wealthy foreigners, many of them Russians and Britons.The tottering banks hold 68 billion euros in deposits, including 38 billion in accounts of more than 100,000 euros - enormous sums for an island of 1.1 million people which could never sustain such a big financial system on its own.

""That's something the U.S. does not do.""""(In the U.S.) there's a clear line between an academic researcher and people engaged in operational (intelligence gathering) activities.""Shanghai Jiaotong declined to comment.CO-AUTHORSIn reviewing the links between the PLA and Shanghai Jiaotong - whose alumni include former President Jiang Zemin, the head of China's top automaker and the former CEO of its most popular Internal portal - Reuters found at least three papers on cyber- warfare on a document-sharing web site that were co-authored by university faculty members and PLA researchers.The papers, on network security and attack detection, state on their title pages they were written by Unit 61398 researchers and professors at Shanghai Jiaotong's School of Information Security Engineering (SISE).In one 2007 paper on how to improve security by designing a collaborative network monitoring system, PLA researcher Chen Yi-qun worked with Xue Zhi, the vice-president of SISE and the school's Communist Party branch secretary. According to his biography on the school's website, Xue is credited with developing China's leading infiltrative cyber-attack platform.Calls and emails to Xue were not answered. Reuters was unable to find contact details for Chen.Fan Lei, an associate professor at Shanghai Jiaotong whose main research areas are network security management and cryptography, also co-authored a paper with Chen. Fan told Reuters he has no links with Unit 61398 and his work with Chen in 2010 was because Chen was a SISE graduate student. Fan said he was unaware Chen was with the PLA when they collaborated. Both of the papers Chen co-wrote with SISE professors stated he was with the PLA unit.Cyber-security experts say the publicly available papers and China's National Information Security Engineering Centre are ostensibly about securing computer networks.""The research seems to be defensive, but cyber-security research in general can be dual purpose,"" said Adam Meyers, director of intelligence at CrowdStrike, a security technology company based in Irvine, California. Figuring out how best to defend networks, by definition, means thinking about the most effective means of attack, he noted.Efforts to reach the PLA for comment on its collaboration with Shanghai Jiaotong were unsuccessful.TECH PARK NEIGHBORSSet amid manicured lawns, Shanghai Jiaotong University is one of China's top four colleges, turning out brilliant technical engineers much in demand by both domestic companies and foreign multinationals. Its reputation has led to tie-ups with elite universities abroad.Last month, Mandiant Corp, a private U.S.-based security firm, accused China's military of cyber-espionage on U.S. and other English-speaking companies, identifying Unit 61398 and its location at a building on the outskirts of Shanghai. China said the report was baseless and lacked ""technical proof"".""SISE at Shanghai Jiaotong has provided support"" to PLA Unit 61398 - known more formally as General Staff Department (GSD), Third Department, Second Bureau - said Russell Hsiao, author of papers on China's cyber-warfare capabilities for Project 2049 Institute, a Virginia-based think-tank, who drew his research from the technical papers and government reports.He said another Shanghai Jiaotong department, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, also did research work with another PLA unit. A Project 2049 report last year found the GSD's Third Department had oversight of ""information security engineering bases"" in Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin.The GSD Third Department's Shanghai base is in an industrial park housing mainly government research institutes and high-tech firms. The SISE building is in the same development, 40 kms from the university's main Minhang campus. Across the street from SISE is the National Information Security Engineering Center, a building commissioned in 2003 by PLA Unit 61398. Also part of the base is the Ministry of Public Security's Third Research Institute, which researches digital forensics and network security.AUTO RESEARCHShanghai Jiaotong is not officially linked to China's military. SISE says on its website its goal is to speed up the development of China's information security sector and address the national shortage of information security professionals.Shanghai Jiaotong set up a joint institute in China's second city in 2006 with the University of Michigan - seeking, it says on its web site, to ""develop innovative and highly reputable education and research programs in various engineering fields."" A spokesman for the U.S. college said it has no relationship with SISE. Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh also had a partnership with Shanghai Jiaotong's School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering, and Singapore Management University said it ended a tie-up with SISE last June.Among the industries in the United States allegedly targeted by Unit 61398, as recently as last year according to Mandiant, is transportation, including the auto sector.The University of Michigan collaborates closely with Detroit-based automakers on research projects, and is one of three colleges that comprise the University Research Corridor, which spent $300 million on R&D projects over the last five years. Nearly a third of that was funded by private industry, according to local consultant the Anderson Economic Group.""There was no indication in 2010 that the joint institute was involved in any way and that also is the case today. We do, of course, watch the news reports on these issues carefully,"" said Rick Fitzgerald, a University of Michigan spokesman, referring to a New York Times report in 2010 citing investigators' claims to have tracked cyber-attacks against Google Inc to Shanghai Jiaotong and an eastern Chinese vocational school.(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle and Joseph Menn in SAN FRANCISCO; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)"

""There are infinitely more questions than answers right now,"" Abrams said in an interview with Empire about what's ahead for the ""Star Wars"" sequel.The director spoke about his approach to the upcoming ""Star Wars"" film, comparing it to his recent work with the ""Star Trek"" franchise. “I feel like I can identify a hunger for what I would want to see again and that is an incredibly exciting place to begin a project,” he added.While the role he nabbed directing the new ""Star Wars"" was a coveted one, Abrams wasn't initially sold. “My knee-jerk reaction was that I’m in the middle of working on the 'Star Trek' movie and I can’t even consider it,"" he said. ""But then time went by and I got further along working on the movie and getting to a place where I had done most of the heavy lifting.""Before the announcement was made that Abrams was tapped to direct, Steven Spielberg was one of the early favorites for the film. A friend of ""Star Wars"" creator George Lucas, Spielberg shot down the rumors, saying ""It's not my genre. It's my best friend George's genre.""So how does Spielberg feel about Abrams taking on the films?“I will say that Steven was very encouraging of 'Star Wars,'"" Abrams said. ""It’s funny because I talked to him about it and it turned out he knew all about what was going on.”For more on Abrams and ""Star Wars,"" head over to Empire."
