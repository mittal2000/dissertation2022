1,ENTERTAINMENT,NBCUniversal Chairman Says Women In Hollywood Face 'Invisible Barrier' As They Age,Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nbcuniversal-bonnie-hammer_us_55e5d0ade4b0b7a9633a4e8e,"Preach, lady.",2015-09-01,"<p><em>Bonnie Hammer, left, with her friend Diane Von Furstenberg.</em></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e5dfca14000077002e49b4.jpeg?ops=crop_17_23_2983_1563%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Longtime programming executive Bonnie Hammer has been called ""the queen of sci-fi"" and ""one of the most successful programmers in cable television"" by The New York Times. She made wrestling a television event, and worked on Lifetime documentaries with ""a shoestring budget"" from a colleague's place ""in the Village, drinking a bottle of wine and watching the rough cuts."" Now, Hammer is chairman of NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment, overseeing USA, Syfy, E!, Bravo, Oxygen, the Esquire Network and others. In the shadow of her 65th birthday, however, the exec took some time to reflect on the ways her gender is often held back from success in Hollywood.""While leading men have been celebrated for their timeless charm and weathered good looks, women my age have been barely visible on screen,"" she wrote for Fortune, adding that women ""try to remain visible by remodeling what age has created.""""Bowing to societal pressures, they’ve lifted brows, tightened skin, filled laugh lines, and realigned proportions,"" Hammer observed, ""all to stretch careers that would have otherwise been jeopardized by simply looking one’s age.""Indeed, we're familiar with stories of women in Hollywood being told they're ""too old."" (Maggie Gyllenhaal's might the cake -- she was told that 37 was too much for her to play the role of a 55-year-old man's love interest.) After their mid-30s, one report found actresses are paid ""significantly less"" than their male counterparts, whose peak earnings happen in their 50s and decrease much more gradually after.But Hammer thinks of ageism and sexism as a broader issue, too. Experienced professional women in any field are routinely dismissed and ignored, she states.""In racetrack jargon, we old mares are sent out to pasture while our male counterparts frolic in stud farms,"" she writes.  ""I feel relevant and valuable and I am struggling to understand why, when women reach age 65, they encounter an invisible barrier of perception that says it’s time to walk away."" Her experience -- which comes with age, as some of us apparently need to be reminded -- has made her ""more focused, more intuitively decisive, much less afraid to take risks."" In racetrack jargon, age actually makes women execs just as studly as the men. ""The stereotype that says we’re past our prime and ready to be forgotten needs to change,"" Hammer concludes.

2,IMPACT,Free Online Course Connects Ex-Inmates With The Job Skills They Need,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/online-course-prison-education-recidivism_us_55e4cf3ae4b0aec9f3544bd5,The aim is to also cut recidivism.,2015-09-01,Photographer Henry Hargreaves - Death Row Last Supper,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a942a71300002c0093a2ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Imagine this scenario: Instead of a judge sentencing an offender to hundreds of hours of community service while behind bars, they are sentenced to hundreds of hours of educational courses ― and those courses are offered for free.Such is the vision of Mike Feerick, the founder of Alison, a Galway, Ireland-based provider of online coursework. Earlier this year, the company debuted a new set of courses called the Advanced Diploma in Workforce Re-entry Skills which is specifically designed for formerly incarcerated Americans.The goal, Feerick explained to BBC in July, is to boost ex-inmates’ job skills and academic credentials while simultaneously reducing their risk of reoffending. “There is a huge opportunity to address recidivism through free online education, so much so that we foresee a day when the obligation to complete free courses could represent an alternative to traditional sentencing,” Feerick told BBC.Research has shown that prison education can do exactly that. A 2013 analysis conducted by the Rand Corporation found that such programs reduce recidivism by 43 percent, improve former inmates’ chances of finding employment and are also cost-effective ― a $1 investment in education for inmates cuts incarceration costs by $4 to $5 within three years of their release.The program was developed in partnership with correctional education experts and covers topics including job search, career planning and basic computer skills, such as how to use Microsoft Word and Excel. Additional modules in the course focus on health and safety issues in food service and customer service in the hospitality industry.Beyond that specific knowledge, one of the most important things the formerly incarcerated will take away from going through the program, Feerick hopes, is confidence.“These people are, or have been at some time, institutionalized,” Feerick explained to Forbes’ Peter High. “For years, they have been told when to get up, eat and sleep. We need to change this mindset to one that is more self-motivated and self-believing. … Even a little independent learning opens up wide new pathways.” Other efforts are underway to harness technology in a way that will help connect America’s largest-in-the-world incarcerated population of 2.24 million with an education, including those who are currently behind bars.Jail Education Solutions, a Chicago startup, has developed Edovo, a platform for specially designed tablet computers that can be used inside correctional facilities. The platform offers a wide range of educational content including literacy training, GED studies and vocational programs. The U.S. Department of Education is also addressing the issue.Earlier this summer, the DOE announced a “second chance” pilot program that will test models allowing the incarcerated to access Pell Grants. While some Republican lawmakers have criticized the plan as a federal overreach and vowed to block it, Education Secretary Arne Duncan has defended it as “just trying to have a few more people have access to what could be a life-chance-forming opportunity” in an interview last month with the Atlantic’s Russell Berman.Also on HuffPost:"

The speech was aimed in part at addressing the Jewish community's concerns about the Iran nuclear deal.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e47df614000077002e47ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama said in an interview published Monday that he respects the motives of Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and some other opponents of the Iran nuclear deal.“I don’t think somebody like a Chuck Schumer wants war,” Obama told Jane Eisner, editor-in-chief of The Forward, a national Jewish newspaper. “That’s not the argument I was making.” Schumer, who is the country’s highest-ranking Jewish elected official and widely expected to succeed Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) as Senate Democratic leader in 2017, announced his opposition to the deal on Aug. 6, striking a blow to the White House’s efforts to ensure support for the accord in Congress.Eisner had asked the president whether he had contributed to the “incendiary language” of a debate about the Iran deal’s merits by implying that opponents of the agreement were “warmongers.” The debate over the Iran deal has been especially contentious within the American Jewish community.Obama stood by his previous insistence that the failure of the Iran nuclear deal would put the United States on course for a military confrontation with Iran. But he nonetheless said that he does not question the sincerity of many of the deal’s opponents, including Schumer. “But the point is that at no point have I ever suggested that those who are critical of the deal are ‘warmongers,’” Obama said. “What I’ve said is that if we reject the deal, the logical conclusion is that if we want to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, military strikes will be the last option remaining at some point. It may not be under my administration; it might be under the next one. And that is something that has to be taken into account in this debate.”Obama is campaigning to ensure that the deal his administration and five other nations negotiated with Iran survives Congressional disapproval. The Republican-controlled House and Senate are expected to pass legislation disapproving of the deal, which Obama would then veto. Now Obama is fighting to lock up the votes needed to prevent Congress from overriding his veto.Obama’s interview in The Forward is aimed at assuaging the concerns of members of the American Jewish community, whose resistance to the agreement may be contributing to the reluctance of some congressional Democrats to back the deal.Suspicion about the deal in some corners of the Jewish community has been stoked by the bitter, public opposition of the current Israeli government to the agreement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the Iran agreement an “historic mistake,” making a controversial speech to Congress against the deal in March at the behest of Republican leadership. Many former senior Israeli security officials have, by contrast, expressed qualified support for the deal. Relations between the Obama administration and Netanyahu’s government have been strained by disagreements about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well, prompting some observers to describe this as the lowest point in U.S.-Israeli relations in decades. The president took pains in the interview with Eisner to characterize the administration’s differences with the Israeli government as a dispute among “family.” He argued that U.S.-Israeli ties were deep enough to withstand occasional disagreements.“The relationships between our peoples, the shared values, the shared commitment to democracy -- those things are so deep that they have survived arguments in the past and they will survive this argument,” he said.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will campaign for former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) in Madison next month, in an attempt to help one of her ideological allies, who was defeated by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) in 2010, return to Congress.""Ron Johnson sides with the big guys who have already made it, while Russ sides with Wisconsin students and working families,"" Warren argues in an email scheduled to be sent to supporters Monday afternoon, and provided in advance to The Huffington Post.The email contrasts Feingold and Johnson's stances on higher education and student loan debt. While Feingold and Warren believe that the federal government shouldn't be able to profit from such debt, Johnson voted against Warren's legislation in 2014 that would have allowed students to refinance their loans. The Republican senator called the legislation “grossly unfair” because the bill would make up for any lost revenue by increasing taxes on wealthy households. Unpaid student debt has doubled since 2007 to nearly $1.3 trillion. Approximately 40 million Americans have student loan debt, with the average borrower owing nearly $30,000.Johnson, who has argued that some students take more than four years to graduate because it's too easy to get a loan, has repeatedly said he doesn't believe the federal government should be involved in student loan programs. ""Here’s the really crazy part about Ron Johnson’s education policy: Forget refinancing – if he has his way, the federal government wouldn’t help college students with loans at all,"" Warren's email reads. ""Kids whose parents can’t afford to write a check for college would lose basic consumer protections and be at the mercy of private lenders who offer loans not at lower government interest rates, but at 8%, 10%, 12% – or even higher.""Her email also notes that Johnson wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms, and that he doesn’t think the federal government should set a national minimum wage. Democrats have started to talk about student loan debt much more frequently on the campaign trail, in large part because Warren has championed the issue in the Senate. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton earlier this month released her own plan to reduce the burden of student debt by taxing the wealthy. Warren campaigned for a number of Democratic Senate candidates during the 2014 midterm elections, so her Wisconsin trip is likely to be just the first of more campaign stops to come as the election gets underway.
