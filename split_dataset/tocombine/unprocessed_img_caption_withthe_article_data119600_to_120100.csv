Welcome to Fremont, California, a nondescript suburb of 217,000 tucked in the high-tech region between San Francisco and Silicon Valley where something unique is happening: manufacturing. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cb3f2400003100576f5e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the most contentious primaries in the country reached a fever pitch Thursday after a labor-backed Democratic political action committee adopted a controversial strategy in support of Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.). Honda faces a strong challenge from fellow Democrat Ro Khanna, an attorney and former Obama administration official. Republican physician Dr. Vanila Singh and Republican businessman and executive recruiter Joel Vanlandinham are also running in California's nonpartisan primary June 3. The top two vote-getters, regardless of their party affiliation, will advance to November's general election in the Asian-American majority, Silicon-Valley area 17th District. As the Bay Area News Group's Josh Richman first reported, the Working for Us PAC is paying for one set of mailers attacking Khanna, with another set speaking positively of Singh, in an apparent bid to cost Khanna votes. At a minimum, the tactic appears to be aimed at giving Honda a larger margin of victory over Khanna, though the ultimate goal could be to push Singh past Khanna in Tuesday's primary so Honda has an easier path to victory in November. A Federal Elections Commission report shows that the PAC is spending $45,113.69 on mail attacking Khanna and $21,425.75 on mail in support of Singh.The Singh mailer calls her ""The Right Choice for Republicans,"" and at the bottom reads, ""Republicans: Vote for Vanila Singh for Congress.""“Our primary goal here is to try to ensure the re-election of Mike Honda … who has fought every day of his career to improve the lives of working people,” the PAC's President Steve Rosenthal told Richman on Thursday. “We wanted to make sure Republicans know who the real Republican is,” he added of the pro-Singh mailer, claiming there isn't much daylight between Singh and Khanna in terms of their policy positions. Khanna's campaign had harsh words for the PAC's mailer strategy. “Congressman Honda’s close supporters and Vanila Singh have formed an alliance,” Khanna campaign manager Leah Cowan said in a statement included in Richman's report. “This is a desperate move by people who claim to be progressive champions, but spend money propping up a Republican candidate. This is the worst type of old style politics and Congressman Honda should immediately denounce his close supporters who are engaging in this behavior.”Honda's campaign defended itself by noting that independent expenditure committees like the labor-backed PAC are barred from coordinating messages with the campaign. “We had nothing to do with this independent expenditure and aren’t going to be distracted by what other campaigns or groups are doing,” Honda spokesman Vivek Kembaiyan said Thursday. “Our campaign is focused on getting out the vote for Mike Honda on Tuesday and making sure that voters know about Mike’s record of delivering for the middle class families of Silicon Valley.”Singh's campaign, for its part, didn't seem to mind the help. ""If a PAC would like to tell Republican voters that Vanila Singh is the real Republican in the race, then we agree with that message and have been working for months by contacting tens of thousands of voters to inform them of the same thing,"" Singh campaign manager Matt Shupe said. The National Republican Congressional Committee and Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) have both backed Singh's candidacy. Khanna's campaign asked Honda to sign a ""people's pledge"" to prevent outside spending from influencing their race's outcome in January. Honda's campaign declined the offer. The challenger's campaign also filed an ethics charge against Honda last week concerning mass mailings from the congressman's office to his constituents. The race has attracted national attention in part because, while President Barack Obama and many of California's highest-profile politicians have endorsed Honda, several of the president's former campaign aides work for Khanna. Khanna has received donations from a number of Silicon Valley luminaries, such as Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Napster co-founder Sean Parker, while Honda has received support from a host of progressive advocacy groups.

(Photo by Craig Herndon/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badfaee2400005000964d57.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Words live longer than the poets who wrote them, Longer than the rhapsode who speaks them..."" My friends have been writing, reminding me of my Maya Angelou story, of my brief but meaningful time with her. Bending on my right knee at her side, I made every effort to meet her eye to eye in her wheelchair. ""Stand, Eric. Do not bow,"" she implored. ""Do not bow or kneel to any man. Remember that! I know all about you. I know your story. I know where you have come from. You have traveled too far from Montgomery to bow. We all have traveled too far from Montgomery to ever bow again.""She knew about my upbringing in the tightknit community of Madison Park, founded by slaves freed as a result of the Civil War. I stood, adjusting myself, shaking the crease back into my trousers, all while we held each other's hands and looked into each other's eyes.All my life I have wanted to be a poet. I wanted to write words, stringing them together in broken patterns, to rhyme and rearrange and make the ordered strange. From a very early age, I also knew why the caged bird sings -- words, they just seemed liberating.""I have been told you are a poet,"" she said.""No, Ma'am, not a poet, just a scribbler,"" I responded""CHILD, we all scribble on every scrap we can...giving every word new meaning by the way we write it down,"" she retorted.I took mental notes, line by line, not omitting one word that she said.""I have made you some tea. Go and get some and come sit down and pull up that chair in front of me and let's talk. Eric, you are so formal. Relax, honey.""Relaxing myself as best I could (I was born un-relaxed), I took out my handkerchief and wiped the dampness from my brow. Why was I sweating? I was here, in Maya Angelou's house. Poets were not new to me: I had met Rita Dove in college and ate collards and catfish with Gwendolyn Brooks down in Birmingham, but I had never been to either's house. Neither of them had ever made me sweet tea nor reprimanded me for kneeling.Just before 8:30 a.m., on April 25, 2007, I landed in Greensboro, NC, where I was to deliver a speech that afternoon to the World Affairs Council. My friend, Ambassador Bonnie McElveen-Hunter, offered to pick me up at the airport and to my surprise she and the legendary civil rights leader and businessman Bob Brown were waiting for me at my gate. While I stood, luggage in hand, Bob turned to Bonnie and said, ""Should we tell him about our surprise? Eric, we are on our way to Winston-Salem. An old friend of mine wants to meet you!""As the black car turned the corner and passed through the gates to the yellow brick house, I saw words coming out of the chimney, growing in the front garden, and climbing the barks of trees. In the brightness of the day and ""on the pulse of morning"" I had arrived at the place of my beginning.""Eric the reader!"" Ms. Angelou exclaimed. ""So, whom do you read? Who are the poets that you keep going back to over and over again?""Too embarrassed to simply say, ""You,"" I quickly called off some of my favorites who immediately came to mind: Wordsworth, Donne, Browning, Eliot, and, of course, Shakespeare.""Lovely, just lovely, but are there not more?"" she asked.Bob and Bonnie looked on as if giving audience to the teacher and her pupil.""Well, yes ma'am, there are so many more. I love Langston Hughes, and Gwendolyn Brooks, and do you know Gerard Manley Hopkins?"" I responded.Almost singing, she recited from memory:""It will flame out, like shining from shook foil; It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod? Generations have trod, have trod, have trod; And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil; And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod."" (-- Gerard Manley Hopkins, ""God's Grandeur"")""Oh I know Gerard Manley Hopkins,"" she laughed. ""His language is so rich and striking. I love the way he uses old words and made-up words, bringing words to life. In a lecture I gave several years ago, I compared him and his use of dialect to that of Robert Burns. Do you know Burns? You studied in Scotland. Have you read any of him? """"Oh yes, ma'am, 'O my Luve's like a red, red rose.'""""Ha!"" she grinned with that bright brilliant smile filled with love and laughter. ""That poem was meant to be sung, and I can sing it too! But you know what I find so interesting about Hopkins is that he often creates compound adjectives, like: Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches' wings...""I was sure enough taking notes in my mind - pages turning, poems running, the fire burning deep within. This was better than Brit Lit. 205.""But tell me, Eric, do you know Paul Laurence Dunbar?"" she asked, leaning in close.She had me there. Silence filled the room as I flipped through my mental rolodex...Dickens, Donne, Dove, Dryden, but no Dunbar.She broke the still silence of the moment waving her hands in the air, lifting herself almost from the chair, singing:""We wear the mask that grins and lies, It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes, This debt we pay to human guile; With torn and bleeding hearts we smile, And mouth with myriad subtleties."" (-- Paul Laurence Dunbar, ""We Wear the Mask"")""You must know Paul Laurence Dunbar. He is where WE begin. Promise me you will learn Paul Laurence Dunbar,"" she implored.I kept my promise.We lingered a bit longer on Dunbar, then she asked me why I liked T.S. Eliot so much. I told her that I was impressed with his understanding of time and place and his use of irony. She asked if I meant by time the idea of history. She reminded me of the influence that French poets had wielded on Eliot. ""Interesting,"" I acknowledged, confessing my lack of deep knowledge of French poetry. She smiled. ""You know quite a bit already, Eric Motley.""She knew Milton, Shakespeare, Keats, Byron, Burns, Donne, and Hopkins as well as she knew Hughes, Brooks, and Paul Laurence Dunbar. Why was I surprised? I felt a deep and wonderfully blessed connection to Ms. Angelou. We had read the same poets and understood both the beauty and strangeness of language and its liberating power. We were both in love with literature. More and more as seconds turned into minutes we talked about the great remembered and historic half-forgotten. Speaking of St. John Perse, she asked me, ""Why do you think no one reads him now? I think he will come back to us again, maybe not tomorrow, but one day soon."" Sitting there in her presence, I remembered. And did I remember.We were at one. In our own lives we had both climbed the ""crystal stair"" of poverty and despair with Langston Hughes and had passed through with Eliot at Little Gidding ""the unknown, unremembered gate / When the last of earth left to discover/ Is that which was the beginning."" Sitting before her, I felt her at my side. She all of a sudden became my guide. Yet, in all of my education I had forgotten that Maya Angelou was not just another poet. She was much more. She was the Oracle. We return to her time and time again, over and over, because she reminds us of our capacity to sing even when the shadows fall. She sings because she is happy. She sings because she is free.I will never forget that afternoon tutorial. It lasted just a little over two hours, but it seemed a full day. Nor will I fail to remember the majesty of her poise and the strength of her voice and the brightness of her eyes. She not only made time for me, she made me tea -- and it was good.The oracle never dies.She had been given by Bonnie a collection of my poems. Handing me the volume, she said: ""Now read me one of yours."" Somewhat nervously, I cleared my throat, and began to read:Her tortoise-rhythm, slowly spun, golden words into unmoored vessels. When she spoke of Pushkin, Mandelstam, Hopkins Honeybees swarmed the sunlit air, leaving cornucopias of sweetness in their flight for freedom. Words live longer than the poets who wrote them, Longer than the rhapsode who speaks them; Translucent fragments, prismatic sonnets, beautified by time. Translating their lines, From parchment to air, They flow like a blest west wind, And disappear, waiting to be sung again. (Eric L. Motley, ""Greta"")"

When asked by Style.com about the reasoning behind the partnership with the ""SNL"" superstar, Wang explained, “Sometimes when fashion becomes too stiff, it’s great to have someone such as Mango come through and inject a new burst of energy. Having fun and a sense of humor is so important to me that when I’m able to incorporate it into my work, I run with it.” Wang has a history of injecting funny business into fashion, and in 2013, he  debuted a short with Bon Qui Qui (a role performed by Anjelah Johnson) from ""MadTV"" helping customers like Alessandra Ambrosio, A$AP Rocky, Shannan Click, Simon Doonan and Natasha Lyonne in his stores.

It was simply pleasant to get comfy, lean back and recollect, imagine every so often.I thank my lucky stars I've lived long enough to go nutty over older women's bodies. It's not anything I ever thought I'd go nutty over.With each one, you can't memorize the whole body. There's so much going on! Contours aplenty, shapes galore, curves, mounds, crannies, sections soft, hard, comfy to hold. When they move any which way, they change! Nothing is ever the same, there's constant motion.You could spend hours with one and you're never finished, you never see or touch or experience everything. Impossible.Afterwards, you think about what you've missed, what you didn't quite get to. There'll always be something new to play with, pinch, brush against the next time.And all those scents, tastes, whiffs of all sorts...With younger bodies ... they're the same from top to bottom. Same shape, same skin, same rubbery feel. Nothing much there. Unfinished, incomplete. Like they were just hatched from pods - smooth and slippery, no essence yet. And only a few curves and barely any crannies. Bland and simple. Uninteresting.Older bodies are complex, real.Maybe when you're older you need more. Just another 'body' was enough back then. Now, it takes a labyrinthian body to keep you googly-eyed and rambunctious.... Can you imagine if I'd missed all this? Sometimes it's great to still be alive.

8,BUSINESS,Why Fancy Headphones Got So Incredibly Popular,Kim Bhasin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/popular-headphones_n_5360641.html,,2014-05-29,"LOS ANGELES, CA - SEPTEMBER 06: DJ A-Trak attends the Beats by Dr. Dre celebration for the launch of the Lil Wayne Edition Pro headphones at Playhouse Nightclub in Hollywood on September 6, 2012 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Lester Cohen/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30d41250000cf00389e1e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you want to know how Beats by Dr. Dre became a household name, go back to 2012. That was the year headphones went from ""boring useful thing"" to ""indispensable fashion accessory,"" fueling a holiday sales explosion for Dre's Beats brand and many other purveyors of cool-looking headphones. Apple confirmed Wednesday that it's buying Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre's Beats business for $3 billion. It's thought that the move may be a music-streaming play on the company's part, or a way for Apple to tap the business savvy and music industry connections of Dre and Iovine. But whatever the case, it's hard to imagine the massive sale would have ever come without the initial rise of the entire headphones industry.There's no one reason headphones took off in 2012. It was more like a remarkable concurrence of tech events: The smartphone wars were in full swing as the iPhone 5 launched against Samsung's supposed iPhone killer, the Galaxy S3. Sweden-based streaming music service Spotify, which entered the U.S. in 2011, had gained a foothold. Beats' star-powered marketing struck a chord with shoppers. Fashion and tech began to meld.And more people were buying smartphones and listening to music on them, and they didn't want to look like white-earbud-wearing automatons. Trumpeted as a hot fashion trend, headphone brands like Beats and Skullcandy leapt into the limelight, leading to skyrocketing revenue numbers. Previously, headphones were widely seen as a utilitarian object for music listening, except among audiophiles willing to dish out hundreds on high-end headphones from old-guard brands like Sennheiser.""The newest fashion accessory isn't a fashion accessory at all,"" GQ declared in mid-2011, setting the stage. ""It's head-swaddling, high-style headphones that make as much of a statement as anything else you're wearing.""It all led to a 32 percent spike in retail headphone industry revenue in 2012, lifting the market to $1.37 billion. Beats saw its revenues snowball 75 percent to $519 million, according to The Financial Times. The retail headphones industry has experienced 8.4 percent annual growth over the past five years, and is now a $1.6 billion market, according to an April report from the market research firm IBISWorld. ""Headphones are really desirable to have, almost becoming essential in terms of the accessory you want when you have a smartphone or tablet,"" said James Crompton, an industry analyst at IBISWorld.Headphones have benefited from improvements in design and engineering. Today, lower-cost headphones give consumers a lot more than they used to. No longer do people have to settle for simple little earbuds adorned with fuzzy covers that crackle and die within a few weeks. Now, even the cheaper models are packed full of glitzy features like rubber gel pads, built-in microphones and adjustable cords.It also helps that where manufacturers were once limited to selling in local electronics stores, now they can get their wares to the masses more easily, with online shops, big retailers and kiosks everywhere. Crompton pointed to airport vending machines like Best Buy's, which offer headphones at a time travelers need them most. The health and exercise craze has helped too, he said, as people often don earbuds and bring phones along for their workouts.Despite the emergence of big, bulky over-the-head models as fashion accessories, IBISWorld predicts that earbuds will be the industry's future. They currently account for about 54 percent of the retail headphone industry's revenue.Whatever other factors have contributed, the headphone rush could not have happened without the ballooning smartphone market. Between November 2013 and February 2014, the number of smartphone owners in the U.S. rose 7 percent to 163.2 million, according to data from the research firm comScore. Today, 68 percent of mobile subscribers in the U.S. have smartphones, a number that's steadily increasing. See this chart from Business Insider:More and more, these smartphone owners are using their phones to listen to music. More than half of headphone owners connected to a smartphone in 2013, up from 36 percent the year before, according to market research from the NPD Group. And market research firm eMarketer found that around 70 million Americans used music streaming services like Spotify and Pandora or listened to downloaded music on their phones in 2013 -- more than double the number who did so in 2011.And teens, hands perpetually affixed to their mobile devices, have remained very interested in fashionable headphones. As seen on this chart from the asset management firm Piper Jaffray, after headphone sales took off in 2012, teens have continued to demand them every holiday season since.For the younger crowd, the focus has been on pricey headphones. Beats, whose most famous style of headphones runs for $300, dominates teen wish lists. Apple and its ubiquitous earbuds are a distant second. From Piper Jaffray:There's a lot to be happy about if you're a headphone-maker, but at the same time, the buying frenzy of a few years ago is already a thing of the past. IBISWorld predicts just 0.8 percent annual growth in industry revenue from 2014 to 2019. With Beats aligned with Apple and industry growth slowing, legacy headphone brands like Sony and Bose are primed for a death match to claim whatever customers are left. "

From the rock bottom to highfalutin, Middlebrow is your accessible guidebook to the world of entertainment. Sign up to receive it in your inbox here.Seth Rogen railed against Washington Post film critic Ann Hornaday when she cited ""Neighbors"" in a discussion of the murders that took place near University of California's Santa Barbara campus on May 23. This conversation, though more familiar in terms of violence, is not new: ""Neighbors,"" nor any film that's not a gun-control documentary, certainly doesn’t work to remedy the prevalence of mass shootings. But rather than hurrying to call movies the cause of misogyny or violence, we ought to consider the possibility that they are actually the effect of a culture that actively glorifies these things.From a scientific perspective, movies, television and video games do not cause violence. What proof do we have that the sorts of people who are watching violent media don't have violent predilections to begin with? At best, there is a reciprocal interaction at play. There are studies that evidence this, but a much more tangible example comes in the form of the “Dexter” murders. Dexter's method influenced the way the crimes were carried out, but the show has no actual culpability: It's impossible to say whether, in lieu of Dexter's Saran Wrap, the guilty parties would not have simply committed the crime in a different way. These acts draw a fine line between art inspiring violence and being responsible for it, as does the potential for ""Neighbors"" to affect Elliot Rodger's sexist feelings of entitlement.If we’re talking about people being inspired to commit crimes for certain ways or because of certain reasons (i.e. because they cannot “get girls,” as was understood to be the implication with Rogen's films), there's a predisposition of violence or misogyny that is perhaps enhanced (but, again, not caused) by pop culture. So, what is causing these predilections? There’s a much more important conversation to be had about the role that mental health factors in to such horrific incidents. But our ideology condones misogyny and violence, and that is what drives us to have (as Hornaday later put it in response to the uproar) ""such a narrow range of stories that we go back to."" Speaking specifically to misogyny, we can look to the movement of #YesAllWomen tweets in response to the UCSB shooting for evidence; sexual harassment, victim blaming or physical intimidation exist because of something prevalent throughout our culture. Sure, the Judd Apatow canon often trades in unsavory (read: sexist) themes. Of course, there are much more harrowing examples, but all of these movies (indeed, movies in general) are a reflection of our culture. It's possible to argue that perhaps they reinforce these things, but they would not even be created if they didn't fit nicely within the presiding ideology. There is heaping tons of violence and/or misogyny in works like “Marvel's The Avengers,"" ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" or, heck, even “Sex and the City 2,” but you’ll note that not one of those films is widely considered controversial. Instead, they reflect the norm.The mediums that value violence and misogyny are created by and for a society which seems happy to accept these things, even at a subconscious level. The hope is that we can change the discussion to focus on that problematic ideology. These are real issues at hand, which is a point that was lost in Hornaday's piece amid the upset at her examples. If a film like “Neighbors” or show like “Dexter” can truly influence someone to the extent they commit murder, it’s more than likely that they’d be ""set off"" by some other aspect of our flawed culture. Ultimately, funneling outrage into a specific movie, TV show or video game only serves to help us lose focus on the presiding issues that have led us to accept ""latest shooting"" as a common phrase.Follow Lauren Duca on Twitter: @laurenduca"
