The European Space Agency astronaut successfully completed the race on Sunday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571da4a7160000e90031c893.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After months of preparation, Tim Peake clinched an out-of-this-world achievement on Sunday: He became the first man (and second person) to complete a marathon in space. The British astronaut ran the London Marathon while strapped to a treadmill aboard the International Space Station. His final time? Three hours, 35 minutes and 21 seconds.The ISS reportedly traveled around the planet more than twice in the time that it took for Peake to complete the race.“Gonna sleep well tonight,” the astronaut quipped on Twitter following his achievement.According to The Guardian, Peake kept himself occupied during the race by watching TV coverage of the marathon and using an interactive app called RunSocial, which allowed him to participate in a digital version of the event.Peake is the first man, but the second human, to complete a marathon in orbit. NASA astronaut Sunita Williams completed the Boston Marathon while on the ISS in 2007.Williams ran the race in just under four and a half hours, making Peake the fastest marathon finisher in space, according to Guinness World Records.As The Guardian notes, however, it’s difficult to compare the two astronauts' times, as they ran with different harnesses under different loads. Still, given the challenges of running such a long distance in zero gravity, Peake's achievement is notable.""Tim has captured the hearts and minds of the nation since his mission on-board the International Space Station began last year,"" said Marco Frigatti of the Guinness World Records in a statement. ""His latest achievement is surely his greatest -- running the fastest marathon in space, on the only day-off from his gruelling schedule is fantastic accomplishment. Tim is a true inspiration and someone we can all look up to. Literally."""

""That’s where I would like to see them focus their attention.""Her comments came in response to the decision by a U.S. appeals court to restore Tom Brady’s four-game suspension after a protracted legal battle between the NFL and the NFL Players Association.In May 2015, the New England Patriots quarterback was suspended for his alleged role in a plot to use under-inflated footballs, which can be easier to handle. Brady fought the suspension, and in September 2015, U.S. District Judge Richard Berman nullified it. Now, that suspension is back on, which means Brady will probably have to sit out the first four games of the season. (Brady does have a few legal options left, but they are shrinking. Sports Illustrated legal analyst Michael McCann outlines them here.)The NFL has been plagued by domestic violence issues over the past few years. As HuffPost’s Mollie Reilly wrote earlier this year: [T]he shadows of Ray Rice, Greg Hardy and other players accused of assaulting their wives and girlfriends — and the memory of the league’s various disappointing responses to those cases — still loom large over the sport. The NFL and the NFL Players Association are reportedly working toward a deal that would strip Roger Goodell of disciplinary power. "

Pat McCrory (R) has been widely criticized over the law, known as HB 2 before it was enacted. More than 180 businesses have condemned it as discriminatory and called for a repeal. Bruce Springsteen canceled a concert in protest. Former basketball player Charles Barkley called for moving the 2017 NBA All-Star Game out of Charlotte, while PayPal decided against expanding its business operations to the city.On Friday, President Barack Obama called the state law ""wrong"" and said it ""should be overturned.""McCrory spokesman Josh Ellis responded by defending it. ""The governor respectfully disagrees with the political left's national agenda to mandate changes to basic, common-sense restroom norms,"" Ellis said in a statement.It's not likely the repeal bill will get very far. HB 2 passed the state House and Senate on wide margins, and the governor is standing by it. It appears more likely that, if the law goes down, it will be because of a lawsuit. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal are challenging it in federal court, arguing that it is unconstitutional because it violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the 14th Amendment.Critics of the law are still pressuring McCrory and the legislature to reverse course. On Monday, a coalition of civil rights, faith and business leaders delivered more than 150,000 signatures to the governor's office, urging a repeal of the law. Thousands of people are expected to rally outside the legislature.""HB 2 was a reckless attempt to malign and marginalize transgender people, and it is bringing immense harm to our state's people, economy, and reputation,"" Sarah Preston, acting executive director of the ACLU of North Carolina, said in a statement. ""The General Assembly must work as expeditiously as possible to repeal this terrible law as it worked to pass it.""McCrory's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the repeal legislation."

The scripted series which stars Lyndsy Fonseca, Cyrina Fiallo and Williams premiered on April 20 via Verizon’s media streaming go90 entertainment app. The show follows aspiring DJ Allison Lee (played by Fonseca) who finds herself in a 24-hour time loop as she's left with the decision to choose between her career goals or her friends.Filming the 10-minute episodes was an unparalleled experience in comparison to previous roles, according to Williams.“I actually liked it. It still releases 12 episodes like a regular show, but we shot it like a movie which is nice,” Williams said to The Huffington Post. “We got all the scripts up front, which for a regular show you don’t. You typically get them week to week. So as far as building a character or understanding where the script is going, it’s not the same. So I actually prefer to have all the information up front. So it was nice.”Prior to his descent into the new media series, the 23-year-old actor netted network success by starring on ""Everybody Hates Chris,"" ""The Walking Dead"" and most recently, ""Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders."" Despite his proven track record to land roles on network television, Williams says there’s still a need to address the ongoing diversity issues that plague TV. ""There’s definitely diversity issues, although I do think we're actually on the right track,"" he says. ""One which being the fact that there’s so much content out there. Back in the day, if you weren’t on a show on one of the five major networks you just wasn’t on a show. Now every network is coming up with original programming. So I think that’s one way to address it, just by sheer volume of jobs available… So I think we just need to keep trucking forward and reminding people that it doesn’t necessarily have to be a black story for it to have a black actor.""In addition to a solid career in television, Williams made his motion picture debut in the 2014 satirical drama ""Dear White People."" He says that ""at some point, film is the ultimate goal,"" and the role of slain teenager Emmett Till is one of the stories the actor says he would like to bring to the silver screen. ""I don’t think there's been a really good Emmett Till story yet. That would be nice to get done,"" he told HuffPost. ""Anything that kind of tells a story that we haven't heard before. I think sometimes we fall into the trap of telling the same stories over and over again, with different names of characters. I'm looking for that sixth story, not the first five that people can come up with.""Episode one of “RePlay” is now available on the go90 entertainment app and you can check it below."
6,POLITICS,Flint Residents Get Discounted Water Bills,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flint-water-bills_us_571e397de4b0d4d3f723e0bd,Some are confused by how their discount was calculated.,2016-04-25,"In February, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) approved legislation creating a $30 million reimbursement plan for Flint water customers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571e428f160000e40031c96e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Residents of Flint, Michigan, have been paying the highest water bills in America for water they can't even drink because it's tainted with lead. This month, they're finally getting some relief -- a discount on all bills going forward based on how much customers have paid since April 2014, when Flint disastrously switched its water source.When Joy Murray logged into her online water account last week, she saw she'd been credited with $424. Since she hadn't paid a bill since December out of protest, the discount brought her balance down to $16. Murray, who lives in Flint's College Cultural neighborhood, said she's glad to be getting a discount, but said she thinks it's a little odd Flint residents are getting only partial rebates on water that is still completely unsafe.""The number one problem is we need clean water,"" Murray, 50, said in an interview. ""The number two problem is we need affordable water.""In February, Gov. Rick Snyder (R) approved legislation creating a $30 million reimbursement plan for Flint water customers. ""Flint residents should not have to pay for water they cannot drink,"" Snyder said at the time. Residents can drink the water if they have a filter certified to remove lead, something Snyder has been encouraging people to do by drinking it himself. The plan gives customers a lump-sum credit for 65 percent of what they've been billed for water usage since April 2014, plus 65 percent off on future water bills until testing shows the water is safe to drink. Since Flint water bills are split between usage and sewer service, and the credit only applies to the former, the discount should amount to less than 65 percent of the total cost for most customers. Darryl Baird called the credit a slap in the face. ""It's ridiculous,"" said Baird, who lives in Flint's Woodcroft Estates neighborhood. ""From a consumer standpoint, I know if I have a defective product I get a refund, not some discount.""Baird said he and his wife have a 9-month-old son who had a small amount of lead in his blood when they had him checked in December. The baby hadn't been drinking formula made with the water, but Baird figures the exposure probably came from breastmilk.Pediatricians typically don't test kids for lead until their one-year checkup, but Flint residents have been urged to be extra vigilant. Blood tests can only detect lead within a few weeks of exposure; after that, the toxin hides in the bones. Snyder's government admitted the water was unsafe to drink in October after a local pediatrician reported increased lead poisoning among Flint kids following the city's switch to the Flint River two years ago. State regulators told the city not to treat the water to prevent it from leaching lead from the city's aging pipes, so the lead went from the pipes into people's drinking water.Childhood lead exposure can result in permanent brain damage and behavioral problems later in life. No amount of exposure is safe. Several Flint residents told HuffPost they were confused about how their discount was calculated. Online accounts show billing histories that indicate how many units of water were used each month. Murray's credit amounted to more than $8 per unit since April 2014, whereas some neighbors got less.One of Murray's neighbors, David Roach, decided to try to see what discount Mayor Karen Weaver got, since the online billing system lets people look up anyone's address. ""I thought I could maybe come up with the formula they were using, basically to verify that we are getting what we're supposed to get,"" Roach said. It seemed that the mayor received more credit per unit than Roach and his neighbors, but the mayor's office told The Huffington Post that the discount is based on how much people paid, not how many units of water they used, and that per-unit costs can vary depending on the size of a home's water meter.""It would be misleading to try to convert the amount of a person's credit to an average per unit because it is so highly individualized,"" a Weaver spokeswoman said in an email. The spokeswoman added that the address provided was charged more for water because it had a one-inch water meter, whereas the average home has a meter that’s only five-eighths of an inch.Roach, 59, said he was satisfied by the answer and is glad to be getting a discount even if the process wasn't perfectly clear at first. ""I guess I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth,"" he said. "
7,POLITICS,Convention Rules May Stop Donald Trump If Ted Cruz Continues Picking Up Delegates,Robert Baldwin III,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-convention-rules-donald-trump_us_571e642de4b0f309baee1f29,Trump's inability to connect with local leaders may come back to haunt him.,2016-04-25,Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at Hagerstown Regional Airport days before Maryland's presidential primary.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571e6d64220000360025471d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Good news for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, and the Republican moderates staring at 2016 with existential dread: Even if the GOP doesn’t mount a coup at the convention’s rules committee in July, someone who is not named Donald Trump or Ted Cruz could still secure the presidential nomination.That was the message late last week out of the Republican National Committee's spring meeting in Hollywood, Florida, and it’s further proof of the golden rule in politics: He who has the gold makes the rules.Of course, the conventional wisdom coming into the spring meeting was that Trump and Cruz, the two candidates with the most delegates, would pack the convention rules committee with their own people to ensure that certain stipulations from the 2012 convention remain in place -- particularly rule 40(b), which requires a candidate for the nomination to have the support of a majority of delegates in at least eight states. (Kasich has met that threshold in exactly zero states.)But even if the rules committee keeps that statute before the convention, it wouldn’t theoretically prevent an establishment white knight from eventually riding into Cleveland.“You don’t have to have your name put in nomination,” Kasich strategist Mike Biundo told reporters outside of an RNC meeting last week. “All that means is you don't get the speech and the pomp and circumstance.”Kasich is banking on multiple rounds of balloting during the nomination process, as rule 40(b) would indeed prevent the Ohio governor's votes from being registered on the first ballot. If 40(b) remains in place, delegates could cast votes for him, but the secretary wouldn’t officially recognize or record them.But Kasich’s bound delegates -- and the delegates of former candidate Marco Rubio, for that matter -- are only bound to support him on the first ballot, regardless of whether the vote will actually count. After the initial ballot, Kasich can pull in newly freed delegates to compete for a nomination.“In other words, candidates who did not qualify under rule 40 for the first vote could qualify thereafter,” said University of Georgia political science lecturer Josh Putnam. A candidate can become a threat to reach the magic number of 1,237 delegates if his bound delegates stay with him, Putnam explained, and if he's able to pull in enough support from other delegates that become unbound after the inconclusive first vote.But the possibility of Kasich or another party savior flying in to save the day depends on two things: delegate loyalty and the rules committee.For the most part, the delegates are pledged to vote for the two front-runners. The party could bring in candidates by way of more liberal rules, but the campaigns with the most delegates make those rules. As Putnam puts it, Trump and Cruz have a “vested interest” in keeping the rules similar to the 2012 bylaws.If there’s any possibility, however remote, for a rule change, local delegates will be a crucial factor. State and local Republican establishments are generally responsible for selecting delegates, and those delegates are essentially bound to vote for the candidate that wins the state. As a result, Trump has gained delegates who may be willing to vote against him if given the opportunity.“And that’s where Trump is having a very difficult time -- trying to ensure that the people who are selected by the state party apparatus are really true-blue Trump people, and many of them aren’t,” said former White House chief of staff Harold Ickes.Cruz has a much better operation at the state and local level, Ickes said, “and so Cruz delegates are going to be more likely to stick with him on a second ballot.""But all of this, of course, depends on preventing Trump from reaching 1,237 delegates on the first ballot. Cruz and Kasich's recent effort to team up may help that effort. But if Trump is able to secure the necessary delegates before the start of the convention, attempts to circumvent his nomination will end at the rules committee. Still, there are ways to change the rules even if Trump gets to 1,237 delegates before the convention. And though there’s been little indication that GOP leaders are willing to make drastic changes, someone like Kasich could issue a so-called “minority report” to propose an alternative rules package that would need at least 28 members of the 112-member rules committee to get to the floor for a vote.It's another long shot, but there's a chance nonetheless.Matt Fuller contributed to this report."

Posting on the thread is open to the public and not exclusive to firefighters, so it's not clear who is responsible for them.Commenters went after multiple women believed to be Fairfax County employees and volunteers, making claims about their promiscuity, sharing their photos and judging their attractiveness. In one case, a woman's selection for a paramedic program is credited to ""the guys she regularly sleeps with, including her chief.""Though the thread has remained active for nearly two years, it only made headlines upon news of Mittendorff's disappearance, which sparked a six-day manhunt last week.Authorities found Mittendorff's body on Thursday inside Shenandoah National Park. A medical examiner ruled her death a suicide, ABC7 reported, and police confirmed that there was a suicide note in her car.Fairfax Fire and Rescue is now investigating the online posts, Fairfax County Fire Chief Richard Bowers said in a statement on Saturday. ""We at Fairfax Fire and Rescue are aware of the posts and are looking into the matter. I assure you that my department can not and will not tolerate bullying of any kind,” Bowers stated. “We will thoroughly investigate this matter and take any appropriate actions needed. However, right now we ask that we be allowed to grieve the loss of one of our own.”What is not clear is how long the fire department knew of the posts and how they were handled, if at all.Fairfax Underground moderator Cary Wiedemann said that anonymous posters can be identified and information can be supplied to law enforcement officers.""I have and will continue to retain all IP addresses of Fairfax Underground posters indefinitely in case any court wishes to unmask the perpetrators of this abuse,"" Wiedemann said in an email to The Huffington Post on Monday.According to the website's rules, which are posted on its welcome page, any spam, unrelated posts, personal attacks and impersonations are subject to removal.Wiedemann said that moderators do not actively seek out inappropriate content.

We talked about how the conversation around abortion was so politicized, and had so much rhetoric and how it was really stuck. We thought, what if we could make a film that really focused on women and women’s stories? And I chose to focus on my home state of Missouri. I needed it to come from a personal place, and for me that’s my home turf. I thought the focus on Missouri was really interesting, given how much we talk about Texas right now. It was nice to focus on another place that has been hit really hard by abortion restrictions, but perhaps we don’t hear about as much.Exactly. It made sense, both for me as a filmmaker and also that what was happening there was very relevant and largely uncovered. Missouri is one of the most restrictive states in the country when it comes to abortion. In 2014, they passed a 72-hour waiting period. And it almost feels like the state legislators are able to do stuff that’s pretty outrageous because the rest of the world is not holding them accountable or watching. So these stories and the conditions these women are facing aren’t being heard.How did you make this movie without getting supremely angry? I think that would have been hard for me.Well, yeah. I consider myself a feminist. I am absolutely 100 percent [pro-abortion rights]. If there was a way for me to be more so than I was, I am after making this film and seeing what it’s like when women don’t have agency over their own bodies and can’t make choices for themselves.

Was that baked into your process?We started with women and abortion stories, and then it became clear that if we’re talking about “options,” what are those options? What do those options look like? We’re really talking about unplanned pregnancy. Let’s explore what that feels like and what resources are there for women who are facing it.Teandra, [a woman in the film] who wanted to have an abortion or put her child up for adoption, [but because of her male partner’s objections] these were options that were not ultimately available to her. And the default position, which is that every unplanned pregnancy results in a baby -- is pretty tough to ask of women. Watch a clip from""Abortion: Stories Women Tell"" below:Were you surprised by the stories you heard from women who are anti-abortion activists, especially coming at this as someone who believes in reproductive access and choice?When approaching those women and hearing those stories, I felt I really had to listen very closely and very generously. I didn’t agree with them, but I wanted to understand where they were coming from and how they come to the conclusions they did. It was surprising to me that many [of the pro-life women I spoke to] had had abortions. Susan [Jaramillo, an author and anti-abortion activist] is one that you hear the most from, but she was certainly not the only woman who was involved in the pro-life movement who had had multiple abortions. It really struck me that, when she needed an abortion, it was there for her, but she didn’t want other women now to make that choice or have that option. That doesn’t necessarily feel fair, but it was interesting to meet these [women involved in the pro-life movement] and to hear how they had come to their work.Yeah, I found that really fascinating as well.Discussions about abortion often become so black and white.

That’s the context around it all for women. It’s like Amie [whose medication abortion at Hope Clinic is followed in the film] says: “I’m not a whore because I had sex.”But there’s just a culture, and especially in Missouri, of abstinence. There’s the idea that people shouldn't be using birth control, and basically you should wait to have sex until you’re married.

And being with women on the day of their procedures -- that was a big ask. But the women that appeared in the film, they were the women who chose to be on camera, and there was always a reason. It wasn’t that they were doing me a favor. It was that they wanted to tell their story. Often they had felt somehow unduly criticized or sent to hell by walking through this line of protesters, and they wanted to reclaim their experiences -- for themselves but also for the women that might come after them, so that they would not feel so alone. There was a real understanding among the women in the film that sharing stories was important and might help other women.What do you hope people take away from the film?I hope it will be a powerful film that can shift the conversation away from political rhetoric and “sides.” It’s been so many years after Roe v. Wade, and abortion is legal, but so many women don’t have access. So, what does that look like? It’s something we can talk about in the abstract, but until people see what that [lack of access] looks like for real women, it’s hard to fight against. So I hope this film will be used in all kinds of ways to shift that conversation.This interview has been edited and condensed."

Department of Motor Vehicles non-drivers’ photo ID. She is 107 years old.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571e46221900002d0056c20e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Plenty of people recognize Virginia McLaurin these days. The 107-year-old woman became an Internet sensation after the White House posted video of her joyfully dancing with the Obamas. The video has been viewed nearly 66 million times. But that recognition isn't enough for Washington, D.C.'s Department of Motor Vehicles, which won't issue McLaurin a new photo ID. In an interview with The Washington Post, McLaurin described how she lost her photo ID years ago when her purse was stolen. She and her son recently met with a DMV official to try to replace it. But because of strict new federal guidelines, she needs to show her birth certificate to get a new ID. And in order to get her birth certificate from South Carolina, she needs to show photo ID. ""I don't think I’ll ever get that face card,” McLaurin told The Washington Post. ""I was birthed by a midwife and the birthday put in a Bible somewhere. I don’t know if they even had birth certificates back then.""She has a temporary ID, but that won't work if she wants to fly, for example. McLaurin is, however, still able to vote. That's because Washington, D.C., doesn't require photo ID in order to cast a ballot. But in many other states, McLaurin wouldn't be so fortunate. Seventeen states have some sort of photo ID law in place for the 2016 elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In recent years, GOP politicians across the nation have pushed through a number of measures restricting access to the ballot box. These laws tend to disproportionately affect African-American, Latino, elderly and low-income voters -- who also, not coincidentally, generally support Democrats. ""It's sad to see my mother having to stand in lines, getting tired,"" Felipe Cardoso, McLaurin's son, said. ""She can’t understand how her picture could be in all those newspapers and all over the Internet, how so many people could recognize her on the street and want to take selfies with her, and she can’t even get a photo ID.""UPDATE: April 26 -- D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Tuesday that the city was expanding the list of acceptable documents required to obtain a District-issued Real ID for D.C. residents age 70 and older.Bowser and other D.C. officials visited McLaurin Tuesday afternoon to help her complete the necessary paperwork, according to The Washington Post. She received a temporary ID that will be valid until her permanent one arrives in the mail.""I thank the Lord, Mayor Bowser, and everyone who helped me get my photo ID renewed,"" McLaurin said. ""I am especially happy to know that now all seniors in D.C., will be able to get an ID more easily."""
13,POLITICS,Clay Aiken Is Still Plagued By Guilt Over His Primary Opponent's Death,Sam Stein and Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clay-aiken-campaign-keith-crisco_us_571cd581e4b0d912d5fee64b,"He says he ""didn't have the balls"" to reach out to the man's wife.",2016-04-25,"When Clay Aiken ran for Congress in 2014, few people took the race seriously. And after his primary opponent died, the campaign trail became a dark and difficult place.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571cd679160000e90031c875.jpeg?ops=crop_92_135_2809_1396%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Clay Aiken's congressional run in 2014 was never going to be a typical political affair. Not only was he a former ""American Idol"" and reality television star trying to hack it in the world of politics -- he was an openly gay man running in a conservative House district in North Carolina. The ingredients were there for a tumultuous race. Along the way, however, the campaign veered away from being entertaining into a dark, somber place. Just days after losing to Aiken by a narrow margin, his opponent in the primary, Keith Crisco, was found dead -- bringing the election to a halt and deeply affecting everyone involved.In the latest episode of the Candidate Confessional podcast, Aiken opens up about just how profound an impact that moment had, revealing the guilt he grapples with to this day. ""This sounds incredibly selfish, because who am I to be bothered by my lack of closure when he has children, and a wife and grandkids that didn't have closure with him? But I never got to tell him that I had a lot of respect for him and I never got to apologize for the fact that, at times, I wasn't nice to him,"" Aiken said. ""I wonder if his family hates me. I hope not,"" he continued. ""But I can't help but wonder if one has a heart attack after they spend $750,000 and still lose to that little queer when he was far more qualified for it, at least on paper.""When he found out about Crisco's death, Aiken was sitting in a restaurant with his top strategist looking at potential campaign managers for the general election. A call came in to the strategist with the news. Everyone around the table was floored. They stayed there for an hour, barely speaking. They decided to go dark politically. Aiken took down his ads and his website. He thought about going to the funeral but opted against it, worried that if he showed, he would become the story. Instead, he had a top aide reach out to the family to convey his condolences.He never reached out himself, Aiken said.""To be completely honest with you, I didn't have the balls. I ain't going to lie,"" he said. Eventually, things reverted back to normal -- however normal a campaign can be. The general election began, Aiken struggled to overcome his perception as a pop star and went on to lose a race that, in all likelihood, neither he nor any Democrats was going to win in the difficult 2014 cycle. In the weeks and months after Crisco's death, Aiken said he was too overwhelmed -- physically and emotionally -- to reach out to Crisco's family. But in the months and years that followed, he hasn't connected still. The guilt hasn't receded, Aiken said, fighting back tears as he spoke.""I have, almost every month even still here a year, two years on now, almost two years since he has passed away, have wondered, have thought about wanting to see her,"" he said of Crisco's widow. ""I don't think she hates me today. I hope she doesn't.""""I hope the family, his kids, don't hate me today. They might still. But I'm sure they did that day,"" Aiken said. ""He had spent his last three months of his life away from them. He had canceled a vacation that he and his wife -- they had planned to go to Cuba actually -- and he had canceled that vacation to stay on the trail and run against me. The last three months of his life were stressful and not enjoyable, and I was to blame for that.""This podcast was edited by Christine Conetta and record by Nicholas Offenberg.Listen to the podcast above or download it on iTunes.

14,POLITICS,This Former Opera Star Thinks His Country Will Be Russia's Next Ukraine,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/georgia-russia-paata-burchuladze_us_571a56a7e4b0d4d3f7232c00,Paata Burchuladze is working Capitol Hill to raise awareness about Georgia's worries.,2016-04-25,"Paata Burchuladze, a former opera star and the founder of the Georgian Development Foundation.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571a58fb160000e90031c7c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Paata Burchuladze, a native of the small ex-Soviet country of Georgia, knows how to be ""sly, gravelly,"" ""imposing"" and ""wonderfully menacing,"" according to reviewers who have seen him perform during his 35-year career in the international opera world. Does that mean the millionaire performer is ready to tackle the United States Congress?Maybe not, but he says he feels a patriotic duty to rise to the challenge regardless. ""Mostly Georgia is Atlanta to them,"" Burchuladze said of the 40-odd lawmakers and congressional staffers he has met with in two separate trips to Washington in recent weeks. He worries that the lack of awareness means the U.S. will not pay enough attention to a critical moment for his homeland: parliamentary elections scheduled for Oct. 8, which will determine Georgia's next government. With all musical commitments canceled for the foreseeable future, the bulky bass singer is now the face of an advocacy group called the Georgian Development Foundation.Burchuladze believes election season will invite foul play by Georgia's powerful neighbor Russia. He wants American attention to ensure the elections are fair in what he calls a ""strategic partner"" for Washington -- a bastion of pro-Western sentiment, and relatively democratic politics, which is a stone's throw from Russia, Turkey and Iran. Georgia's rulers have tried for over a decade to increase formal ties with NATO, the European Union and the U.S., though they have made only limited progress. Last December, NATO signaled its intention to expand by inviting Montenegro to join the alliance, but it didn't offer Georgia a pathway to membership -- a move some experts suggested was because of Russian opposition to expanding the military alliance.Russia maintains that two regions overwhelmingly considered part of Georgia by the international community -- South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- are independent states. It deployed troops to them in 2008 to push back Georgian government forces trying to crush separatists. And it has signed treaty agreements with them over the last two years.Russia's recent history with other neighbors doesn't inspire very much optimism from people like Burchuladze. It's now been two years since President Vladimir Putin formally annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Prior to that, Putin had already been encouraging pro-Russian separatist fighters in other parts of the country. The militiamen seized, and still control, parts of eastern Ukraine.More than 9,000 people have died in the region since April 2014 despite attempts to cease the fighting under internationally negotiated ceasefires and harsh Western sanctions meant to deter Russian aggression.""We can discuss everything with Russia but that we are independent and that we will take a Western direction,"" Burchuladze told The Huffington Post in a recent interview. ""We have a problem with Russia which we would like very much to solve … it's important for the U.S. to try to help.""His foundation, which he launched in the Georgian capital of Tblisi in November and is expanding throughout the country, appears designed to elicit American attention. It has set up offices in Washington and Los Angeles and begun thinking about ways to bring American investment and pro-democracy funding to Georgia, he said. It's also hired American publicists to help Burchuladze arrange meetings around D.C. Why the sudden rush to act? ""The pressure of Russia is very big and our government is afraid to make the next step and I think it's not right.""The foundation is not a political party, Burchuladze emphasized. Still, Georgian media is filled with rumors that it's simply a political vehicle for the opera star, who can compensate for his lack of government experience by speaking of how prominently he has represented his nation abroad. It remains possible that he will announce a run for parliament within weeks, and he's certainly well aware of the reputation he's established. ""Ask your father if he's heard of me,"" Burchuladze said, when this reporter mentioned family members who are opera fans. Burchuladze told HuffPost he presently has no intention of endorsing a candidate or party in the elections. Both major political groups, the ruling Georgia Dream coalition and the opposition United National Movement, are in favor of closer ties with the West. But Georgia Dream's government, in power since 2012, has opened up political space for pro-Russian voices who were wary of being too assertive under the UNM government, which often clamped down on opposition figures and media outlets it viewed as being too close to Russia.Now, a weak economy and the two top parties' inability to win bigger commitments from the West has resulted in more Georgians believing their future might instead lie with Russia. The proportion of Georgians in favor of joining the Russia-dominated Eurasian Union, an alternative to the EU, tripled between 2013 and 2015, according to polling by the National Democratic Institute. The situation in Ukraine has also affected Georgian opinion, according to analysts in the country. ""Putin looks like a strong guy who's getting his way. ... So people think, 'What exactly are the benefits from Europe?' Maybe it's silly to resist Russia so much,"" Ghia Nodia, a Tblisi-based researcher, told the Financial Times last year. Even though Georgians may feel developing ties with the West is their best bet in the long run, trade with Russia and its proxies in the Eurasian Union could deliver short-term benefits, according to Michael Hikari Cecire, a scholar at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Russia's physical power in the country is growing even more dramatically than its soft power. In 2014 and 2015 respectively, the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia signed agreements with Putin that opened their borders to Russia and gave Moscow control over their troops and economies -- essentially handing them over to Russia. A Guardian investigation into Russian activities in South Ossetia found that Putin's troops had built border fences, gun positions and observation towers on the line they had drawn between one part of Georgia and another. People who identified as Georgians have now found themselves in the self-proclaimed independent state, or have been told their orchards lie across a new international border. Meanwhile, almost 30,000 Georgians remain in refugee camps because of the 2008 war. Both Russia and Georgia committed horrific crimes against civilians during that conflict, according to Human Rights Watch.Observers like Cecire warn that further Russian domination of Georgia would threaten European hopes to substitute unreliable Russian oil and gas supplies with energy from Central Asia, and potentially create a new source of instability and tension in an overlooked region.""Under Russian domination, Georgia might fall back into a mirror image of its 1990s past: a failed state and open air market for illicit trade,"" the academic wrote in the Washington Post in January. ""Racked by civil war and warlordism, it could be a fertile ground for radicalism."" Two former U.S. ambassadors to Georgia and one former European diplomat made a similar call in a U.S. News and World Report op-ed that same month. ""Georgia is a former Soviet success story,"" wrote Denis Corboy, William Courtney and Kenneth Yalowitz. ""Georgians should know that the West has their back.""During his visit to Washington this week, Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili will likely make a similar case in a Tuesday address at the United States Institute of Peace.But the appeal for more U.S. involvement in a relatively remote region is unlikely to have much of an impact at a time when America is rethinking how much it wants to intervene in world affairs. President Barack Obama has decided, according to Jeffrey Goldberg's recent analysis of his foreign policy, that he has little interest in American involvement in arenas that he sees as naturally destined to be dominated by Russia -- like Ukraine and Georgia.

15,POLITICS,This Former Opera Star Thinks His Country Will Be Russia's Next Ukraine,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/georgia-russia-paata-burchuladze_us_571a56a7e4b0d4d3f7232c00,Paata Burchuladze is working Capitol Hill to raise awareness about Georgia's worries.,2016-04-25,"Paata Burchuladze, left, during a dress rehearsal of Tchaikovsky's ""Mazeppa,"" at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on Friday, March 3, 2006. He says he has stepped away from music to focus on serving his country.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571a57c6160000e90031c7be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Paata Burchuladze, a native of the small ex-Soviet country of Georgia, knows how to be ""sly, gravelly,"" ""imposing"" and ""wonderfully menacing,"" according to reviewers who have seen him perform during his 35-year career in the international opera world. Does that mean the millionaire performer is ready to tackle the United States Congress?Maybe not, but he says he feels a patriotic duty to rise to the challenge regardless. ""Mostly Georgia is Atlanta to them,"" Burchuladze said of the 40-odd lawmakers and congressional staffers he has met with in two separate trips to Washington in recent weeks. He worries that the lack of awareness means the U.S. will not pay enough attention to a critical moment for his homeland: parliamentary elections scheduled for Oct. 8, which will determine Georgia's next government. With all musical commitments canceled for the foreseeable future, the bulky bass singer is now the face of an advocacy group called the Georgian Development Foundation.Burchuladze believes election season will invite foul play by Georgia's powerful neighbor Russia. He wants American attention to ensure the elections are fair in what he calls a ""strategic partner"" for Washington -- a bastion of pro-Western sentiment, and relatively democratic politics, which is a stone's throw from Russia, Turkey and Iran. Georgia's rulers have tried for over a decade to increase formal ties with NATO, the European Union and the U.S., though they have made only limited progress. Last December, NATO signaled its intention to expand by inviting Montenegro to join the alliance, but it didn't offer Georgia a pathway to membership -- a move some experts suggested was because of Russian opposition to expanding the military alliance.Russia maintains that two regions overwhelmingly considered part of Georgia by the international community -- South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- are independent states. It deployed troops to them in 2008 to push back Georgian government forces trying to crush separatists. And it has signed treaty agreements with them over the last two years.Russia's recent history with other neighbors doesn't inspire very much optimism from people like Burchuladze. It's now been two years since President Vladimir Putin formally annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Prior to that, Putin had already been encouraging pro-Russian separatist fighters in other parts of the country. The militiamen seized, and still control, parts of eastern Ukraine.More than 9,000 people have died in the region since April 2014 despite attempts to cease the fighting under internationally negotiated ceasefires and harsh Western sanctions meant to deter Russian aggression.""We can discuss everything with Russia but that we are independent and that we will take a Western direction,"" Burchuladze told The Huffington Post in a recent interview. ""We have a problem with Russia which we would like very much to solve … it's important for the U.S. to try to help.""His foundation, which he launched in the Georgian capital of Tblisi in November and is expanding throughout the country, appears designed to elicit American attention. It has set up offices in Washington and Los Angeles and begun thinking about ways to bring American investment and pro-democracy funding to Georgia, he said. It's also hired American publicists to help Burchuladze arrange meetings around D.C. Why the sudden rush to act? ""The pressure of Russia is very big and our government is afraid to make the next step and I think it's not right.""The foundation is not a political party, Burchuladze emphasized. Still, Georgian media is filled with rumors that it's simply a political vehicle for the opera star, who can compensate for his lack of government experience by speaking of how prominently he has represented his nation abroad. It remains possible that he will announce a run for parliament within weeks, and he's certainly well aware of the reputation he's established. ""Ask your father if he's heard of me,"" Burchuladze said, when this reporter mentioned family members who are opera fans. Burchuladze told HuffPost he presently has no intention of endorsing a candidate or party in the elections. Both major political groups, the ruling Georgia Dream coalition and the opposition United National Movement, are in favor of closer ties with the West. But Georgia Dream's government, in power since 2012, has opened up political space for pro-Russian voices who were wary of being too assertive under the UNM government, which often clamped down on opposition figures and media outlets it viewed as being too close to Russia.Now, a weak economy and the two top parties' inability to win bigger commitments from the West has resulted in more Georgians believing their future might instead lie with Russia. The proportion of Georgians in favor of joining the Russia-dominated Eurasian Union, an alternative to the EU, tripled between 2013 and 2015, according to polling by the National Democratic Institute. The situation in Ukraine has also affected Georgian opinion, according to analysts in the country. ""Putin looks like a strong guy who's getting his way. ... So people think, 'What exactly are the benefits from Europe?' Maybe it's silly to resist Russia so much,"" Ghia Nodia, a Tblisi-based researcher, told the Financial Times last year. Even though Georgians may feel developing ties with the West is their best bet in the long run, trade with Russia and its proxies in the Eurasian Union could deliver short-term benefits, according to Michael Hikari Cecire, a scholar at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Russia's physical power in the country is growing even more dramatically than its soft power. In 2014 and 2015 respectively, the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia signed agreements with Putin that opened their borders to Russia and gave Moscow control over their troops and economies -- essentially handing them over to Russia. A Guardian investigation into Russian activities in South Ossetia found that Putin's troops had built border fences, gun positions and observation towers on the line they had drawn between one part of Georgia and another. People who identified as Georgians have now found themselves in the self-proclaimed independent state, or have been told their orchards lie across a new international border. Meanwhile, almost 30,000 Georgians remain in refugee camps because of the 2008 war. Both Russia and Georgia committed horrific crimes against civilians during that conflict, according to Human Rights Watch.Observers like Cecire warn that further Russian domination of Georgia would threaten European hopes to substitute unreliable Russian oil and gas supplies with energy from Central Asia, and potentially create a new source of instability and tension in an overlooked region.""Under Russian domination, Georgia might fall back into a mirror image of its 1990s past: a failed state and open air market for illicit trade,"" the academic wrote in the Washington Post in January. ""Racked by civil war and warlordism, it could be a fertile ground for radicalism."" Two former U.S. ambassadors to Georgia and one former European diplomat made a similar call in a U.S. News and World Report op-ed that same month. ""Georgia is a former Soviet success story,"" wrote Denis Corboy, William Courtney and Kenneth Yalowitz. ""Georgians should know that the West has their back.""During his visit to Washington this week, Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili will likely make a similar case in a Tuesday address at the United States Institute of Peace.But the appeal for more U.S. involvement in a relatively remote region is unlikely to have much of an impact at a time when America is rethinking how much it wants to intervene in world affairs. President Barack Obama has decided, according to Jeffrey Goldberg's recent analysis of his foreign policy, that he has little interest in American involvement in arenas that he sees as naturally destined to be dominated by Russia -- like Ukraine and Georgia. In his view, no amount of American support to these nations or evidence of an American willingness to act to protect them can deter Moscow. He told Goldberg he sees that position as ""realistic"" rather than ""fatalistic.""And with Americans war-weary and praise of the Russian leader growing in political discourse on the left and right here, yelling ""the Russians are coming!' doesn't have the impact it once did.

Witnesses said the attackers shouted “Allahu Akbar” (”God is greatest)” as they fled the scene.Mannan was employed by the U.S. embassy, working for the U.S. Agency for International Development, the State Department in Washington said.State Department spokesman John Kirby said the United States was “outraged” by the “barbaric attack.” He called Mannan, “a beloved member of our embassy family and a courageous advocate for LGBTI rights - human rights, actually.”“LGBTI” stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex.A spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council, Ned Price, said the United States strongly urged the Bangladeshi government to ensure the perpetrators were brought to justice.Other attacks took place in the country on Monday, but it was not immediately clear whether those assaults were carried out by Islamist militants.Two men on a motorcycle shot dead a former prison guard in front of Kashimpur jail, on the outskirts of Dhaka, said Khandakar Rezaul Hasan, chief of the local police station.A teacher was hacked to death in the southwestern district of Kustia, police said.The Muslim-majority nation of 160 million people has seen a surge in violent attacks over the past few months in which liberal activists, members of minority Muslim sects and other religious groups have been targeted.Five secular bloggers and a publisher have been hacked to death in Bangladesh since February 2015.A group affiliated with al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the killing of a liberal Bangladeshi blogger this month.Islamic State has also claimed responsibility for the killings of two foreigners and attacks on mosques and Christian priests in Bangladesh since September.The government has denied that Islamic State or al Qaeda groups have a presence in the country and said homegrown Islamist radicals are behind the attacks.At least five militants have been killed in shootouts since November as security forces have stepped up a crackdown on Islamist militants looking to establish a Muslim state based on sharia, or Islamic religious law.(Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed and David Brunnstrom in Washington; Editing by Richard Balmforth and Jonathan Oatis)"

In 2015, there were 214 million new cases reported in 95 countries, and more than 400,000 deaths.* Africa is the most affected region, home to 88 percent of cases and 90 percent of deaths last year.* Since 2000, malaria death rates have fallen by 60 percent, and new cases have dropped by 37 percent globally. In Africa, death rates dropped by 66 percent overall, and by 71 percent among children under 5 years.* These advances came through widespread use of insecticide-treated bednets, indoor spraying, rapid diagnostic testing and artemisinin-based combination therapies over the past decade.* Mosquitoes are developing resistance to insecticides used to treat bednets and for indoor spraying.* In parts of Southeast Asia, a parasite that causes malaria has developed resistance to treatments, and there are concerns this resistance could spread to other regions with dire health consequences.* Resistance to previous generations of medicines, such as chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, became widespread in the 1970s and 1980s, reversing gains in child survival* In January, WHO recommended large-scale pilot projects of a new vaccine in parts of Africa, which could pave the way for wider deployment.Source: WHO (Reporting by Alex Whiting, Editing by Ros Russell.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.

22,POLITICS,Here's The Candidate Who Could Help Bernie Sanders' Dreams Come True,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-fetterman-senate-candidate-bernie-sanders-dreams_us_571bcd0ae4b0d0042da977d1,"If Braddock mayor John Fetterman can pull off an upset in Pennsylvania's primary, Sanders could get a kindred spirit in the U.S. Senate.",2016-04-24,"John Fetterman addresses a crowd on the roof of his home during his announcement that he is running for the U.S. Senate in Braddock, Pennsylvania, Sept. 14, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA — The hulking, big-hearted mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, is not especially welcome in Washington, D.C.It’s not that the 46-year-old, 6-foot-8 John Fetterman can’t get a meeting with the power brokers in the nation’s capital. But the one he got last year with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee showed that the antipathy is at least somewhat mutual.“We did talk to the DSCC in D.C.,” Fetterman recalled Friday, sitting outside a donut shop and cafe before taping the final debate of a Democratic Senate primary that features front-running former Rep. Joe Sestak and Katie McGinty, the former chief of staff to Gov. Tom Wolf.“We talked to them actually for four or five hours, and they were like, ‘Hey, you guys, you know, good with us,’ and ‘We’re staying out of it.’”But as of last week, the DSCC had spent about $1.5 million on advertising for McGinty.“They reneged on that promise, clearly, in a big, big way,” Fetterman said. “That’s the only conversation that we’ve had in Washington with the elites or the establishment.”Fetterman is not especially surprised. He's the sort of outsider whose ideas about inequality and belief in the need for fundamental change have long alarmed cautious, triangulation-prone party leaders who now worry that Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is making overly bold promises that he can't possibly deliver. But Fetterman is also exactly the sort of candidate who, if he can win, would give Sanders a better chance of passing things like a $15 minimum wage, universal health care and free public college. And right now, not only are Democratic Party leaders not helping, they're standing in the way. The DSCC declined to discuss its conversations with candidates, but the steps the committee has taken show pretty well what its strategists are thinking. With the rise of Donald Trump on the Republican side and the potentially historic election of Hillary Clinton, Washington insiders feel like their best chance to pick off GOP incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey rests with McGinty, an accomplished woman who served in the Clinton administration.And Fetterman isn't even their top concern in the Pennsylvania primary. They are much more focused on the prickly, advice-averse Sestak, who narrowly lost to Toomey six years ago.But it’s entirely possible that in shunning Fetterman, they’ve missed a chance to embrace a candidate who better reflects the disruptive mood of 2016 and the anti-establishment fervor that’s propelled the unlikely presidential bids of both Trump and the 74-year-old democratic socialist, Sanders.McGinty, 52, and Sestak, a 64-year-old former admiral, embody the old Democratic Party that has left younger voters and many others cold, in Fetterman’s view.“I wanted to be a true progressive option in a race of more centrist and kind of traditional Democrats,” said Fetterman, who has endorsed Sanders.If Fetterman is anything, it’s non-traditional. After graduating from business school and starting a lucrative career in insurance (his father also had built a successful insurance business in York, Pennsylvania), personal tragedy prompted Fetterman to reconsider his life's path.One day when he was 23, Fetterman waited for his best friend to pick him up for a workout. His friend died in a car crash on the way there. The resulting introspection led Fetterman to wonder why he had been so fortunate, compared to others, and to look for ways to spread some of that good fortune around.Big Brothers Big Sisters in New Haven, Connecticut, where he lived at the time, paired him with an 8-year-old boy whose father had died of AIDS and whose mother was soon to perish from the disease. “It really completely changed my perspective on this idea that I call the random lottery of birth, where I’m born into a situation where I have two master’s degrees, no student loan debt, I have a future, and this little boy was an AIDS orphan before his ninth birthday,” Fetterman said. “The gap is too much; there’s just too much disparity.”Fetterman quit his high-paying job and joined AmeriCorps, which sent him to Pittsburgh. A successful stint there helping adults upgrade their job skills led him back to school at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, where he grabbed a master’s degree in public policy.He eventually settled in Braddock, a town of not much more than 2,000 people, mostly African-American, just outside of Pittsburgh. Once the community where Andrew Carnegie started his steel empire, the town was plagued by drugs, depression and, despite its small size, murder rates in the double digits.Fetterman moved into the basement of an abandoned church and spent several years working, among other things, to get young men off the street corners, out of gangs and into GED programs. He ran for mayor in 2005 and won by one vote.Since then, he’s put his heart into the place, tattooing its zip code onto one arm and the dates of the five murders in the town since his election on the other. He’s cleaned up vacant homes, started community gardens, attracted new businesses and development and built a community health center when the local hospital closed. His wife, a former undocumented immigrant from Brazil, runs a free store that gives out donated clothes, food and other goods.In short, he’s the kind of leader who practices what Sanders preaches -- and he wants to take it to a bigger stage.“I was born into a fortunate situation, and far too many millions of people in this country are born into a tough situation,” Fetterman said. “We can’t all be equal, of course, but I don’t think the gap should be as big as it is.”In the context of 2016, Fetterman’s policy aspirations are not that different from those of many left-leaning Democrats. He backs a $15 minimum wage, a woman’s right to choose, immigration reform and tighter gun laws, although he’s a gun owner.It’s the way he approaches those issues that puts him at odds with party leaders in Washington who have cast themselves as reasonable compromisers against Republicans who are unyielding obstructionists.Fetterman believes standing in the way can have its place. “I’m the only candidate in this race that’s proud to say I have litmus tests for any Supreme Court nominee that I would vote for, and first and foremost of those is repealing Citizens United,” he said, referring to the 2010 court decision that paved the way for unlimited corporate spending in campaigns.He also doesn’t believe in compromise for compromise’s sake when he views the other side as entirely unreasonable.“This idea that you can compromise with crazy or unreasonable -- that’s not compromise, that is appeasement, and that doesn’t help anybody move it a long,” Fetterman said.“When the other side is espousing these views that have no room for compromise, and they’re absurdist — we don’t argue about the science of the camera that’s recording me, we don’t argue about the science of our iPhones, but why are we arguing about the science of climate?” he said. “It’s just because someone’s gut says if it snowed last week, I don’t have to worry about it — you can’t really compromise on that.”He allows that the divide in the country is especially broad right now, as seen in the rise of both Trump and Sanders. He sees both candidates as opposite sides of the populist coin, with Trump tapping into the destructive, dark side of populism embraced by so many in the tea party.“This tea party, angry mindset -- they’ve just become performance artists. How many more dozens of times are they going to repeal Obamacare? How many dozens of more times are they going to scream and yell about transgender [people] using bathrooms, or that the world will spin off its axis if we grant marriage equality? The only marriage that I saw fall apart after [the Supreme Court upheld marriage equality] was Josh Duggar's,” he said. He also takes the unpolitician-like position of not claiming to have all the answers, including how to bridge the gaping divide. But he promises to try.“[I'm] not guaranteeing an outcome other than to say I guarantee to work hard to achieve that outcome,” Fetterman said.He especially can’t guarantee the outcome of this election.One of the biggest hurdles he points to is the spending in the race, which makes his chances of taking the step up especially slim. Party insiders are determined to advance McGinty, and the combined spending on her behalf by the DSCC and other outside groups exceeds $4 million. That’s on top of almost $3 million spent by her own campaign. Sestak’s campaign and a super PAC backing him have spent about $3.5 million.Fetterman has only raised about $600,000, and state news coverage of the contest has been dominated by the battle between the better-known Sestak and the party’s choice, McGinty.“The money in my race has had massive, massive influence,” Fetterman said. “It’s not about ideas, it’s not about experience, it’s not about debates, it’s about how much money can you bring in from outside forces and just carpet bomb the airwaves with television ads.”In a large state like Pennsylvania, the barrage has left very little room for Fetterman, whose polling numbers have ranged from the single digits to the mid-teens.At the same time, neither Sestak, who generally leads, nor McGinty are getting support above the mid-30 percent range in spite of all their spending.Fetterman still sees a chance to make up the difference by Tuesday’s election, in which he may be able to count on many Sanders supporters swinging his way while Clinton backers split between McGinty and Sestak.“We’re the green on the roulette wheel,” Fetterman said, admitting his path to victory is narrow. “A third of the voters are undecided, a third of each of their respective supporters aren’t sure who they’re voting for, and we believe that we are going to outperform those polls.”And if he doesn't win, it's not like he plans to give up trying to realize his vision of a fairer, more equitable America.""That path to running for the Senate has never gone through a community as poor and as on the fringe as Braddock,"" he said. ""So it’s not like this was a plan that was hatched 15 years ago where I’m like, 'Hmmm, I’m going to win the first election in one of the poorest towns in Pennsylvania in Braddock by one vote and then in 2015-16, these issues that I care about now are going to suddenly be more in the forefront.""He added, ""These issues that I’ve built my career around working against and championing, yeah, that’s certainly not going to change."""
23,POLITICS,Here's The Candidate Who Could Help Bernie Sanders' Dreams Come True,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-fetterman-senate-candidate-bernie-sanders-dreams_us_571bcd0ae4b0d0042da977d1,"If Braddock mayor John Fetterman can pull off an upset in Pennsylvania's primary, Sanders could get a kindred spirit in the U.S. Senate.",2016-04-24,"Braddock Mayor John Fetterman walks through the former United Brethren in Christ Church in Braddock, Pennsylvania, on March 10, 2007.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA — The hulking, big-hearted mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, is not especially welcome in Washington, D.C.It’s not that the 46-year-old, 6-foot-8 John Fetterman can’t get a meeting with the power brokers in the nation’s capital. But the one he got last year with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee showed that the antipathy is at least somewhat mutual.“We did talk to the DSCC in D.C.,” Fetterman recalled Friday, sitting outside a donut shop and cafe before taping the final debate of a Democratic Senate primary that features front-running former Rep. Joe Sestak and Katie McGinty, the former chief of staff to Gov. Tom Wolf.“We talked to them actually for four or five hours, and they were like, ‘Hey, you guys, you know, good with us,’ and ‘We’re staying out of it.’”But as of last week, the DSCC had spent about $1.5 million on advertising for McGinty.“They reneged on that promise, clearly, in a big, big way,” Fetterman said. “That’s the only conversation that we’ve had in Washington with the elites or the establishment.”Fetterman is not especially surprised. He's the sort of outsider whose ideas about inequality and belief in the need for fundamental change have long alarmed cautious, triangulation-prone party leaders who now worry that Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is making overly bold promises that he can't possibly deliver. But Fetterman is also exactly the sort of candidate who, if he can win, would give Sanders a better chance of passing things like a $15 minimum wage, universal health care and free public college. And right now, not only are Democratic Party leaders not helping, they're standing in the way. The DSCC declined to discuss its conversations with candidates, but the steps the committee has taken show pretty well what its strategists are thinking. With the rise of Donald Trump on the Republican side and the potentially historic election of Hillary Clinton, Washington insiders feel like their best chance to pick off GOP incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey rests with McGinty, an accomplished woman who served in the Clinton administration.And Fetterman isn't even their top concern in the Pennsylvania primary. They are much more focused on the prickly, advice-averse Sestak, who narrowly lost to Toomey six years ago.But it’s entirely possible that in shunning Fetterman, they’ve missed a chance to embrace a candidate who better reflects the disruptive mood of 2016 and the anti-establishment fervor that’s propelled the unlikely presidential bids of both Trump and the 74-year-old democratic socialist, Sanders.McGinty, 52, and Sestak, a 64-year-old former admiral, embody the old Democratic Party that has left younger voters and many others cold, in Fetterman’s view.“I wanted to be a true progressive option in a race of more centrist and kind of traditional Democrats,” said Fetterman, who has endorsed Sanders.If Fetterman is anything, it’s non-traditional. After graduating from business school and starting a lucrative career in insurance (his father also had built a successful insurance business in York, Pennsylvania), personal tragedy prompted Fetterman to reconsider his life's path.One day when he was 23, Fetterman waited for his best friend to pick him up for a workout. His friend died in a car crash on the way there. The resulting introspection led Fetterman to wonder why he had been so fortunate, compared to others, and to look for ways to spread some of that good fortune around.Big Brothers Big Sisters in New Haven, Connecticut, where he lived at the time, paired him with an 8-year-old boy whose father had died of AIDS and whose mother was soon to perish from the disease. “It really completely changed my perspective on this idea that I call the random lottery of birth, where I’m born into a situation where I have two master’s degrees, no student loan debt, I have a future, and this little boy was an AIDS orphan before his ninth birthday,” Fetterman said. “The gap is too much; there’s just too much disparity.”Fetterman quit his high-paying job and joined AmeriCorps, which sent him to Pittsburgh. A successful stint there helping adults upgrade their job skills led him back to school at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, where he grabbed a master’s degree in public policy.He eventually settled in Braddock, a town of not much more than 2,000 people, mostly African-American, just outside of Pittsburgh. Once the community where Andrew Carnegie started his steel empire, the town was plagued by drugs, depression and, despite its small size, murder rates in the double digits.Fetterman moved into the basement of an abandoned church and spent several years working, among other things, to get young men off the street corners, out of gangs and into GED programs. He ran for mayor in 2005 and won by one vote.Since then, he’s put his heart into the place, tattooing its zip code onto one arm and the dates of the five murders in the town since his election on the other. He’s cleaned up vacant homes, started community gardens, attracted new businesses and development and built a community health center when the local hospital closed. His wife, a former undocumented immigrant from Brazil, runs a free store that gives out donated clothes, food and other goods.In short, he’s the kind of leader who practices what Sanders preaches -- and he wants to take it to a bigger stage.“I was born into a fortunate situation, and far too many millions of people in this country are born into a tough situation,” Fetterman said. “We can’t all be equal, of course, but I don’t think the gap should be as big as it is.”In the context of 2016, Fetterman’s policy aspirations are not that different from those of many left-leaning Democrats. He backs a $15 minimum wage, a woman’s right to choose, immigration reform and tighter gun laws, although he’s a gun owner.It’s the way he approaches those issues that puts him at odds with party leaders in Washington who have cast themselves as reasonable compromisers against Republicans who are unyielding obstructionists.Fetterman believes standing in the way can have its place. “I’m the only candidate in this race that’s proud to say I have litmus tests for any Supreme Court nominee that I would vote for, and first and foremost of those is repealing Citizens United,” he said, referring to the 2010 court decision that paved the way for unlimited corporate spending in campaigns.He also doesn’t believe in compromise for compromise’s sake when he views the other side as entirely unreasonable.“This idea that you can compromise with crazy or unreasonable -- that’s not compromise, that is appeasement, and that doesn’t help anybody move it a long,” Fetterman said.“When the other side is espousing these views that have no room for compromise, and they’re absurdist — we don’t argue about the science of the camera that’s recording me, we don’t argue about the science of our iPhones, but why are we arguing about the science of climate?” he said. “It’s just because someone’s gut says if it snowed last week, I don’t have to worry about it — you can’t really compromise on that.”He allows that the divide in the country is especially broad right now, as seen in the rise of both Trump and Sanders.

Since setting off from Abu Dhabi in March 2015, Piccard and fellow pilot Andre Borschberg have taken turns flying the plane as part of their mission to fly it around the world. ""It's a new era.

California marks the ninth stop for the plane, which has also stopped in Oman, Myanmar, China and Japan.

He will face Alexander van der Bellen, a former Green Party figurehead, who won 20.4 percent, according to official preliminary results.While the presidency is largely only a ceremonial role, the fact that neither of the main ruling parties will be battling for the post on May 22 marks a major change in Austrian politics - as well as the rising role of the far right in Europe.Members of the center-left Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party have filled the job since it was first put to a popular vote in 1951. The two parties have ruled the nation of 8.7 million in tandem for most of the postwar era.The president is head of state, swears in the chancellor, has the authority to dismiss the cabinet and is commander in chief of the military.The election outcome was ""a resounding slap in the face"" for the government coalition, said Wolfgang Bachmayer, who founded the OGM market research institute.His comments were echoed by political analyst Peter Filzmaier. ""Only those who are satisfied vote for a government party or its candidate,"" he said. ""This time, the annoyed voted for Norbert Hofer.""""FOOD FOR THOUGHT""Around 70 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots, a big turnout compared with around 50 percent six years ago when Social Democrat Heinz Fischer, now 77, was elected for his second term. He could not run for a third term.Peter McDonald, general secretary of co-ruling People's Party acknowledged the scale of the defeat after coming in fifth in the poll with just 11.2 percent of the vote.""We have experienced a landslide that should give the entire political center food for thought,"" he said.The social democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, whose party ranked fourth, said the outcome was a clear warning to the government to work harder and cooperate better.Should Hofer get the top job, he could push to bring forward a parliamentary election due to take place in 2018 as support for his party has been growing.Polls show the Freedom Party above 30 percent, while the coalition parties would struggle to get a combined majority.Showing the far right's growing confidence in Europe, Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Front, hailed a ""beautiful result,"" writing on Twitter: ""Bravo to the Austrian people.""Both the candidates that made it through to the run-off had taken aim at the government over its handling of the migrant crisis. Van der Bellen criticized the government for being too harsh in its treatment of asylum applicants, while Hofer says it has been too soft.""It could hardly be any more dramatic,"" said political consultant Thomas Hofer, adding that he thought Van der Bellen would face a difficult task to win the run-off with the gap between him and Hofer.Neither Faymann nor Vice Chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner from the People's Party said they would make any recommendation for the run-off. Voters should decide independently, they said."

The two parties have ruled the nation of 8.7 million in tandem for most of the postwar era.The president is head of state, swears in the chancellor, has the authority to dismiss the cabinet and is commander in chief of the military.The election outcome was ""a resounding slap in the face"" for the government coalition, said Wolfgang Bachmayer, who founded the OGM market research institute.His comments were echoed by political analyst Peter Filzmaier. ""Only those who are satisfied vote for a government party or its candidate,"" he said. ""This time, the annoyed voted for Norbert Hofer.""""FOOD FOR THOUGHT""Around 70 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots, a big turnout compared with around 50 percent six years ago when Social Democrat Heinz Fischer, now 77, was elected for his second term. He could not run for a third term.Peter McDonald, general secretary of co-ruling People's Party acknowledged the scale of the defeat after coming in fifth in the poll with just 11.2 percent of the vote.""We have experienced a landslide that should give the entire political center food for thought,"" he said.The social democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, whose party ranked fourth, said the outcome was a clear warning to the government to work harder and cooperate better.Should Hofer get the top job, he could push to bring forward a parliamentary election due to take place in 2018 as support for his party has been growing.Polls show the Freedom Party above 30 percent, while the coalition parties would struggle to get a combined majority.Showing the far right's growing confidence in Europe, Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Front, hailed a ""beautiful result,"" writing on Twitter: ""Bravo to the Austrian people.""Both the candidates that made it through to the run-off had taken aim at the government over its handling of the migrant crisis. Van der Bellen criticized the government for being too harsh in its treatment of asylum applicants, while Hofer says it has been too soft.""It could hardly be any more dramatic,"" said political consultant Thomas Hofer, adding that he thought Van der Bellen would face a difficult task to win the run-off with the gap between him and Hofer.Neither Faymann nor Vice Chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner from the People's Party said they would make any recommendation for the run-off. Voters should decide independently, they said."

On board, crew members found a tackle box and an iPhone, the U.S. Coast Guard said. They identified the boat later through its serial number and personal items found inside, he added.
