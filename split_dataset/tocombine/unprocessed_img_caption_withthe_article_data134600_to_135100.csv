1,QUEER VOICES,HRC's Corporate Equality Index Shows Southern Companies Evolving On Gay Rights,Lila Shapiro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lgbt-workplace_us_5bafbf64e4b0ad76926147a6,"The company's policies largely reflected the times.

David Sanford, a lawyer representing other plaintiffs in the case, said the lawsuit was being amended to name the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People as a plaintiff and co-counsel.

(Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafbf643c000066000b9e59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the early 90s, Southern restaurant chain Cracker Barrel drew criticism from gay-rights activists for firing openly gay employees under a policy that required workers to display “normal heterosexual values which have been the foundation of families in our society.”The company's policies largely reflected the times. Sodomy was still a crime, and it was legal in many parts of the country -- and continues to be today -- to fire someone based on their sexual orientation. But experts say that Cracker Barrel's stance has evolved, a sign that the movement's victories go beyond the big cities of the coasts and the Midwest.In an annual survey assessing corporate practices relevant to LGBT employees published this week by Human Rights Campaign, Cracker Barrel was given a score of 45 out of 100, a 10-point boost from the previous year. The survey from the national gay rights group examines the largest businesses in the United States, and gives a score based on a range of practices, including drafting an anti-discrimination policy that includes sexual orientation and gender identity, and creating LGBT employee affinity groups. According to the campaign's report, called the Corporate Equality Index, this year corporations around the United States reached new heights in their support of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers; 304 businesses achieved a top rating of 100, more than any previous year. In 2002, the first year the survey was conducted, just 13 companies achieved a perfect score. Most significantly, hundreds of major businesses weighed in during 2013 on public policy decisions either by signing an amicus brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, or by joining a coalition of companies publicly supporting an federal anti-gay workplace discrimination bill. Although companies like Texas-based Exxon Mobil -- where executives have repeatedly ignored shareholder pressure to protect gay and lesbian employees from discrimination -- and the Georgia fried-chicken chain Chick-fil-A -- whose president stated that legalizing same-sex marriage ""invited God's judgement"" -- continue to make headlines for their opposition to gay rights, a slow, but steadily growing trend is reshaping business practices across the South. ""This rising tide of LGBT corporate engagement has picked up previously unlikely boats in the form of dozens of businesses across the South and Midwest taking initial steps,"" HRC's report says. Deena Fidas helps run the Corporate Equality Index, and often travels to the South to help companies -- including Cracker Barrel -- seeking to improve their ratings. She said she believes companies approach the issue by assessing whether these changes improve their businesses, instead of weighing moral or political values. ""When you strip away some of the language around social issues, you see that where many Southern businesses have landed is a viewpoint, backed up by their own policies and practices, that LGBT equality makes the most sense for them as a business,"" she said.Several Southern-based companies that have improved their scores in recent years confirm this attitude.""Our mission is about pleasing people,"" said Terry Deas, Cracker Barrel's director of diversity and outreach told The Huffington Post. In 2013, the company focused on adding LGBT content to its employee training seminars, participating in local LGBT educational events, and trying to recruit more LGBT employees and partner with LGBT-owned companies. ""It was all about living the mission of our company.""Deas declined to talk about the company's policies more than 20 years ago when gay employees were fired if their sexual orientation was revealed, because he said he has only been with the company for a year and a half.Darden Restaurants, a Florida-based restaurant company that owns brands including Red Lobster and Olive Garden, received the full 100 points on the index last year for the first time. Darden executive Samir Gupte said the improvements Darden has made in the last several years were integral to the company's bottom line. ""If we don't create an environment where everyone can bring their true self to work, we're going to miss engaging our employees, retaining the best people in the business and then delivering a great guest experience,"" Gupte said. The idea that businesses must be LGBT friendly to compete in the global marketplace is as good a marker as any to measure the success of the gay-rights movement, said Bob Witeck, a gay-rights advocate and communications expert who specializes in working with corporations to improve their policies. ""When I started about 20 year ago, companies saw this as far more risk-far less reward. They thought they'd be giving up more than they'd gain,"" he said. ""Today that equation has flipped and clearly corporations get it.""Although nearly all conservative Southern politicians remain set against legalizing gay marriage, or protecting gay employees in the workplace, Fidas said that in her work with Southern companies she does see signs that voters are shifting faster than their elected officials. At a recent training session in Atlanta on LGBT workplace diversity, she asked the employees of various corporations in the audience to share their earliest memories of learning about LGBT people. One woman shared that her father was a Baptist minister and that as a little girl, she and her friends were told that certain musicians and choir members in the church were ""like that"" -- meaning gay. ""Her reference point was that they showed respect for gay people by never acknowledging that they knew they were gay,"" Fidas said. ""What I think you're seeing is some workplaces' policies and benefits catching up with these evolving understandings of the LGBT community and the fact that these have always been our friends, our neighbors and family members.""CORRECTION: Darden Restaurants received the full 100 points on the index for the first time last year, rather than this year.

As President Obama noted during Mandela's memorial service, the South African president's death puts an important question before each of us: ""[H]ow well have I applied his lessons in my own life?""The question can leave us feeling inadequate. Mandela's extraordinary sacrifice to realize his dream of a free South Africa can easily make us question whether the small steps we take in our own lives to promote social justice actually make a difference. But we shouldn't feel that way. Mandela taught the world that ""ordinary"" people can bring about extraordinary change. We learned the same lesson from the American civil rights movement.Mandela once said, ""A fundamental concern for others in our individual and community lives would go a long way in making the world the better place we so passionately dreamt of."" We should take this lesson to heart, because it acknowledges an important truth: The biggest threat to a society isn't injustice but complacency in the face of injustice. We honor Mandela when we stand up for social justice. We honor him when we break down social barriers that allow prejudice and suspicion to fester. We honor him when we reach out to others with a helping hand. Most importantly, we honor him when we keep fighting for justice even after we encounter failure.Mandela understood the power of people of conscience. He understood how one person taking a stand can spark a movement that transforms a society. It should be no surprise that when he first visited the United States, he insisted on meeting Rosa Parks. Though Montgomery, Ala., and Johannesburg, South Africa, are continents apart, he recognized how standing against injustice or helping others can send what Robert Kennedy, in his Cape Town speech, called a ""tiny ripple of hope"" across the globe. These ripples of hope, Kennedy said in 1966, can together ""build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.""The Civil Rights Memorial Center in Montgomery recognizes this power by featuring more than just the stories and images of the martyrs of the civil rights movement. The memorial center includes images of the leaders and foot soldiers of contemporary struggles for justice, including Mandela. These are not disparate movements confined to one place or time. They are one movement across the world, one movement for justice that marches forward every time a voice rises up to say, ""No more."" Now that Mandela is gone, we must ensure that the march for justice continues wherever bigotry and discrimination lurks. It must continue for the LGBT community that still strives for equality. It must continue for workers exploited across the globe. It must continue for children unfairly pushed into our broken juvenile justice system, and for others facing injustice and inequality. But the march for justice can only continue if we marry our ideals to action and raise our voices for justice. This is the path forward. This is the legacy of Madiba."

I remember sitting in my study room during law school, folding my laundry, reading constitutional law, and watching Diana as she slept that peaceful sleep that only babies sleep, unimpeded by the world's troubles. When she awoke, she didn't cry; she just opened her eyes and looked at me, knowing, wise beyond her years. I smiled at her, kissed her all over her little face, and removed every trace of lip gloss before her parents picked her up. Her father Kerven is a close friend and an attorney, and her mother Angel will be a doctor any day now. Haitian father, African-American mother. The mix of law, life, reality. A perfect, whole, little being before me, her whole life before her. As I read my constitutional law book, I never foresaw that by the time she was 4 years old, another nation would overlook its own Constitution to treat people like Diana as less than human. Why do I care about how persons of Haitian lineage are treated in the Dominican Republic? I care because I don't want Diana to grow up in a world where she would be recognized as less than human anywhere she steps foot.The Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic retroactively rescinded the citizenship of persons of Haitian lineage born in the Dominican Republic from 1929 until present day. If Diana had been born in the Dominican Republic, she would have been one of those children -- no longer a person recognized by any state, not entitled to an education or a vote, denied basic humanity and recognition of her existence. Since I authored my initial blog post on this issue in October, ""Dominican Republic's Disappearing People,"" tensions have escalated, and physical violence has been directed at persons of Haitian descent by citizens of the Dominican Republic empowered by the recent court ruling. One particularly unnerving image depicted a man tied to a tree while a mob mercilessly beat him in broad daylight, eerily reminiscent of old lynching scenes in the southern United States. Although the violence does not appear to be state-sponsored, the Dominican Republic's judicial proclamation so devalued Haitian life that its nation's citizens feel comfortable publicly beating a man to death.I recently read a story by a Holocaust survivor in which she describes one of the Nazis' first steps toward dehumanizing Jewish people: rescinding their citizenship and labeling them as persons of no nation in their passports. The Holocaust survivor further discusses the psychological impact that essentially becoming a ""non-person"" caused her as a child. We are obligated to learn from history, to learn to recognize the symptoms of social ills like genocide and racism, and manifestations of those ills, like public beatings and denial of basic humanity, and we must apply the antidote to prevent widespread social infection of the disease of inequity. For Diana, we must entertain an economic boycott of business and the tourism industry in the Dominican Republic until the Constitutional Court reverses its decision and restores human rights to persons of Haitian lineage. While I hold fast to the implementation of an economic boycott, I cannot speak without a discussion of the ramifications of a fiscal affront. As leaders, we too often speak with a misplaced confidence in notions of eternal truth -- we must uphold human rights at all costs. One should not lead with authority absent truth. The truth is that economic sanctions are an imperfect solution to a complex problem.An economic boycott in the Dominican Republic to uphold the rights of displaced Haitians and restore international human rights norms will come at the cost of innocent suffering negatively impacting the poor and marginalized members of society. The legislatures and judges' children will still have food on their tables and uniforms to wear to school. The maids who work at the hotels where business will suffer from a boycott of tourism -- what will they feed their children when they lose their jobs? Although the human rights violations warrant economic sanctions, I cannot in good conscience masquerade an economic boycott as a perfect solution when in reality, ""helping"" restore the rights of some will trammel the rights of innocent others. We must continue to advocate for human rights anywhere forces of inequity threaten justice, but we must also acknowledge our own imperfections, imbuing resolution with a greater sense of truth. I pray for the persons of Haitian lineage who are suffering in the Dominican Republic, and for the innocent citizens who will be negatively impacted by people participating in an economic boycott to restore international human rights. I pray that one day Diana will visit the island of her father's birth, an island home to two nations, and whether she steps foot in the Haiti half or the Dominican Republic half, she will be treated as a whole person."

No one will deny that Nelson Mandela was one of the most powerful human symbols of justice and equality, and as we remember Mandela's remarkable achievements, it's important to recognize where inequality still exists. While many countries take steps forward, one country has taken a significant step back for many of its citizens over the last few months. People who were born in the Dominican Republic, who have never known another country as home, are losing their citizenship. Meet 10-year-old Maria Fernanda. She wants to be a lawyer when she grows up, but that's being threatened because of a new sentence by the Dominican Republic's Constitutional Court. The court revoked the citizenship rights from all persons born in the country to parents with irregular immigration status. Even more shocking, the ruling will be retroactively applied to all persons born in the Dominican Republic since 1929 -- stripping citizenship from hundreds of thousands of people.The policy has been in place since 2007. Maria's mother, Hilda, was first affected in 2011, when the government denied her an identification card even though she was born in the Dominican Republic. Because of her mother's irregular status, Maria Fernanda is also being denied her birth certificate. In the Dominican Republic, you must show proof of citizenship to continue past the eighth grade and get a new birth certificate for every use. Even though Maria Fernanda is only in the fourth grade, her school is already asking for her certificate. Hilda fears her daughter will be unable to continue schooling. ""If they are already asking for their documents now when they are in the lower grades, when they get to the higher courses, they will not be able to study,"" she says. What will happen to girls like Maria if this policy is not overturned? Without access to an education or even to a document that says she exists in the eyes of the government, instead of becoming a lawyer, Maria could likely become a victim of human trafficking, as could many other children in the Dominican Republic. According to the U.S. State Department, the large population of children of Haitian descent ""is particularly vulnerable to trafficking."" This assessment was made prior to their citizenship being taken away. As children whose citizenship is not being recognized will grow up stateless, they will be unable to finish school, gain employment in the formal sector, access proper health care, vote, get married, obtain a passport, or even open a banking account. As opportunities for their future to thrive are taken away, their vulnerabilities to trafficking, abuse, and exploitation will only get worse. Just last year, the Dominican courts had their first forced labor conviction. The case centered on a forced begging ring made of children of Haitian descent who had no papers or identification documents. The recent ruling makes children even more vulnerable to this kind of exploitation. From forced begging to agriculture work to sexual exploitation, children who are not recognized as citizens of their own country will easily slip through the cracks. Like Nelson Mandela, there are youth in the Dominican Republic who are fighting for their freedom. World Vision is helping mobilize these young advocates through a campaign called Mi Derecho, Mi Ciudadanía (My Right, My Citizenship) to call upon leaders of the Dominican Republic to restore full citizenship rights to people affected by the Constitutional Court's sentence. A delegation of youth advocates will be presenting a petition, signed by supporters globally, to the Dominican government next week. Nelson Mandela also said, ""A fundamental concern for others in our individual and community lives would go a long way in making the world the better place we so passionately dreamt of.""
