He was nominated to the job of his life -- Supreme Court justice -- and Republicans won't even give him a vote. It's not that they have bad things to say about him; they just don't want President Barack Obama to fill the empty court seat.It's worth noting there are 46 other Merrick Garlands. That is, 46 other judicial nominees are in the same boat. They’re not in line for the Supreme Court, but like Garland, they’re nominees to federal courts who aren’t getting votes (except one, who just got scheduled for a Monday vote). That's because GOP leaders don't want to confirm judges until 2017. By then, they hope, a Republican will be in the White House and will put forward nominees they like better.Not only are they screwing the judicial branch of government by dragging out confirmations -- when vacancies pile up on district and circuit courts, people's cases can get delayed for years and judges burn out -- but they're screwing themselves. Some GOP senators really need judicial nominees confirmed, but are being denied by their own party leaders.Take Marilyn Horan, who would fill a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, a post that's been vacant for 921 days. She has the support of her Republican senator, Pat Toomey, and has been ready for a confirmation vote since January. But Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) hasn't scheduled it. Suzanne Mitchell would fill a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma that has been empty for 1,006 days. Both of her senators, Republicans James Inhofe and James Lankford, back her. But it's been four months since her nomination and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the Judiciary Committee chairman, hasn't even given her a hearing.For some broader perspective, consider that Republicans have only confirmed 16 judicial nominees since becoming the Senate majority in January 2015. At this same point in President George W. Bush's eighth year, when Democrats controlled the Senate, 40 judicial nominees had been confirmed.Obama said what Republicans are doing to the courts is ""dangerous.""""There’s a lot of work that needs to get done and you need judges, and right now, there are emergency situations in districts across the country,"" the president said at a Thursday event in Chicago.When vacancies don't get filled on the Supreme Court and elsewhere, ""people then just view the courts as an extension of our political parties -- polarized political parties,"" he continued. ""If confidence in the courts consistently breaks down, then you start seeing our attitudes about democracy generally starting to break down, a legitimacy breaking down in ways that are very dangerous.""The last time the Senate confirmed a judge was in mid-February, and that was only because McConnell postponed a package of judicial nominees from 2015 into the new year. There are 15 judicial nominees ready for a confirmation vote right now, but only one of those votes has been scheduled. Another 32 are waiting on the Judiciary Committee, which hasn't held a hearing for a nominee since January. Federal courts, meanwhile, are at 79 vacancies and climbing.""All the air in the room has been taken out by the Supreme Court, but the lower courts are equally problematic, if not worse,"" said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who specializes in judicial confirmations. ""Ninety-nine percent of cases are decided in the lower courts.""The one nominee who is scheduled for a vote is Waverly Crenshaw, a Tennessee district court nominee. If ever there was an obvious nominee to confirm, it's Crenshaw: He's been waiting nine months for a vote, he cleared the Judiciary Committee unanimously and he has the support of both of his GOP senators, Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander. The seat is also a judicial emergency.Giving Crenshaw a vote ""is just giving the least [that the] GOP can,"" Tobias said.It's unclear whether GOP leaders will relent on giving Garland a vote (it's not looking likely), or if they'll pick up the pace on judicial confirmations in general.

2,COLLEGE,Why The Huffington Post Is Going On A Sleep Tour On College Campuses,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arianna-huffington-sleep-tour-college-campuses_us_5707cd28e4b03a9e75d42e1b,"The motto ""Sleep, grades, social life: pick two"" needs to become a thing of the past.",2016-04-08,Arianna Huffington is on a mission to make sure people realize the benefits of adequate high-quality sleep.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5707eb061e000087007068d8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Arianna Huffington, founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post, is starting a somewhat unusual book tour Friday, traveling to college campuses around the country to talk about what students are doing in their dorms. Specifically, she wants to talk about sleep. As Huffington promotes her new book, The Sleep Revolution, she is joining The Huffington Post’s Sleep Revolution College Tour. The tour rolls onto 16 campuses throughout April and into May, just as students prepare for final exams, a time when sleep may seem like the least of their worries. Huffington is focusing on colleges because too many college students believe they must sacrifice sleep ""if they want to do well academically and have a great social life,"" she said in a recent column.""So colleges have in many ways become the boiler room of our burnout culture, with disastrous consequences for our students’ physical and mental health. The method (or cheat code) they use is the one the rest of us use: feeling that there aren’t enough hours in the day, we look for something to cut,"" Huffington wrote. ""And sleep is an easy target. In fact, up against this unforgiving definition of success, sleep doesn’t stand a chance. Indeed, in college life, going without sleep is considered a badge of honor.""She's not wrong. Many college students have affirmed this belief holds true. At some campuses, students brag about how little sleep they get.""At my school, it can seem like a competition to see who can stay up longer to study, and pulling all-nighters seems like proof we are true UChicago students,"" admitted University of Chicago undergrad Jane Jun in a recent blog post.""There is so much happening on college campuses, both academically and socially, that sleep and rest are very low on most students’ lists of priorities,"" Jacqueline Baltz, a University of Southern California student, confessed in her blog post. ""As a freshman, I just thought that sleep deprivation was simply one of the aspects of college culture that I would be forced to adjust to.""Yet in reality, students pulling all-nighters are chasing success the wrong way. Research from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, for example, showed poor sleep habits are a ""strong predictor of academic problems."" Research from the University of California, Irvine, found people who got less than five hours of sleep were more likely to incorporate misinformation into their memories. In other words, pull an all-nighter, and you're more likely to remember the wrong answers for those exam questions. The first stops on the HuffPost sleep tour are Friday at the University of Denver and Georgetown University. Up next are Dominican University, the University of Southern California, Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley. Huffington will personally appear at campuses in Denver, Palo Alto, Las Vegas, Nashville, Chicago and the San Francisco area. During these stops, HuffPost is hosting ""sleep fairs"" to teach students what changes they can make in their lives to improve their sleep habits, while Sleep Number ""will demonstrate lack of sleep with a virtual reality experience at select campuses,"" according to a news release. The tour runs through May 13, finishing at Ohio State University. Three dozen other colleges and universities are hosting similar events, not tied to Huffington's sleep tour. HuffPost is also joining forces with Uber to help people learn about the dangers of driving drowsy and take a pledge against it. At tour stops that Huffington visits, Toyota also will be giving students a $15 discount on one Uber ride to or from campus.Check out some of the free stuff being given away during the tour:"
3,POLITICS,Republicans Are Going At Each Other Over A Stalled Heroin Bill,Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-heroin-opioid-bill-senate-house_us_57066a63e4b0a506064e4999,"""I hope that the talk of hearings and markups isn’t an excuse to delay action,"" Sen. Rob Portman said in a warning to his House colleagues.",2016-04-07,"Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) says the Senate has ""already done the hard part"" when it comes to heroin legislation.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570683711e00008700706758.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: April 13 -- Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) took to the Senate floor again on Wednesday to drag the House for stalling on the Senate's heroin bill.""The Senate passed this bill on March 10, so it has now been 32 days since the Senate passed it,"" Portman said. ""Every day, we lose about 120 Americans to drug overdoses. That means that we’ve lost more than 3,840 Americans since the Senate passed this bill. Nationally, from 2000 to 2014, the rate of overdose deaths doubled, leaving nearly half a million Americans dead from drug overdoses.""Portman noted that despite some promising chatter from the lower chamber, nothing seemed to be happening.""I know that the House Majority Leader said that he wants the House to take on the drug epidemic and pass legislation sometime this month. I appreciate that. I watched the weekly Republican address by Congressman Bob Dold of Illinois. It is clear to me that he is passionate about this issue, and I appreciate his advocacy on behalf of those who need help,"" he said. ""However, I notice that there were no hearings or markups this week, and none are currently scheduled. I hope that changes.""PREVIOUSLY: WASHINGTON -- Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio took the floor of the upper chamber Thursday to put pressure on his House colleagues, condemning inaction that has left the Senate's sweeping heroin legislation to languish. Portman's address was likely sparked by an op-ed published by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in a local paper on Thursday. McCarthy's piece strikes the right notes in describing the historic nature of the opioid epidemic, but then veers off track, suggesting that the House's approach will be to take up and vote on a series of bills being quickly worked up by House Republicans. Law enforcement agencies, health care providers and advocates for the addiction community have spent the last three years working with Portman and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which passed on March 10 by a 94-1 vote. That CARA is largely ignored in McCarthy's op-ed, even though it has 113 bipartisan House co-sponsors, seems to have driven Portman to the Senate floor.""I hope that the talk of hearings and markups isn’t an excuse to delay action,"" Portman said. ""Because, let me just say to my friends in the House, respectfully, the Senate has made your job a lot easier. We have already done the hard part.""""We didn’t just say that we had all the right answers,"" he continued. ""No, we took the time to listen. We conducted three years of fact-finding on this bill. We consulted with experts, with doctors, with law enforcement, with patients in recovery, and with the drug experts in the Obama administration, such as the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. We brought in people from Ohio, my home state, and from all over the country.""Mike Long, a spokesman for McCarthy, said that the House does still plan to debate CARA, amend it in committee and vote on it in the future on the House floor, which would set up a conference committee between the two chambers. But it will also move forward with individual House bills.""There are a number of House Members who have been working on this issue for years given the impact it has had on their districts and constituents. Our leadership has been working with the committees of jurisdiction to schedule these bills for the floor since the beginning of the year,"" Long said. ""Additionally, our committees are reviewing the Senate passed bill while also continuing their work on bills addressing the epidemic. Our goal is to move legislation this spring and work toward a conference with the Senate and in order for the president to sign legislation into law.""It's at least the second time that the congressional obstacle course has gotten in the way of legislation addressing the epidemic. Important measures were left out of CARA because it was passed through the Judiciary Committee rather than the health committee. A piece of legislation allowing doctors to treat up to 500 patients with addiction medication -- an increase from the current cap of 100 -- was left out of CARA, Portman said, because it fell under the jurisdiction of the wrong committee, which wanted to deal with it separately. (HHS has since proposed rules to lift the cap to 200.)Portman is close with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and previously told The Huffington Post that he has been pressing for action. ""I will say this: The House must act, and soon. I’m not going to be patient on this. This is urgent. This is a crisis. And people’s lives are at stake,"" he said, noting that 120 people are dying every day as the House strikes out on its own.Portman, in a previous interview with HuffPost, said he worried that his House colleagues would drift to where Republicans are most comfortable on drug policy: enforcement, interdiction and incarceration. And, true to form, much of the legislation McCarthy mentioned in his op-ed takes a supply-side approach, which does nothing for those already addicted.After mentioning treatment, prevention and education, McCarthy adds, ""However, we cannot forget that so many of these problems stem not only from abuse, but from the illicit drug trade as well. Unfortunately, today we are consistently a step behind in stopping trafficking of opioids and other illegal drugs, but Reps. John Katko (R-N.Y.) and Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) are working on bills to improve operation of our drug laws.""McCarthy's passing reference to the Senate bill only mentions the Republican co-sponsors, the type of partisan approach Portman and most Senate Democrats eschewed, which enabled the chamber to get the near unanimous vote. ""What do we say to the 40 million Americans struggling with addiction when they ask why we’re waiting?"" Portman said Thursday. ""How do we explain to them that, even with this consensus of support for CARA, they have to wait?""Sign up here to get an email from reporter Ryan Grim when he writes a new story."

The ""Game Boy Zero"" device uses a Raspberry Pi Zero computer to read a unique cartridge that holds a memory card containing more games than you probably have time to play. It can run original Game Boy games, Super Nintendo games, Game Boy Advance titles and more.In other words: This is just a Game Boy in looks only. While the classic handheld could only play compatible software in black and white, this device has a sleek color screen and runs titles from a variety of systems. Internally, it's really a computer running a video game emulator -- a program that lets you play pirated old games downloaded from the Internet. Wermy, the YouTube user who uploaded the video of the device, published a series of images to Imgur showing how the device was constructed:He also answered a series of questions about how he made the device in a thread on Reddit. Notably, he added several additional buttons to the Game Boy -- allowing more advanced games to be played -- and the battery is rechargeable. No more AAs!Sure, you could play all of these games on your computer (if you were inclined to download them illegally), but that's no fun. Our only remaining question is: How do we beam this device to our 4-year-old selves?H/T The Verge"
5,ENTERTAINMENT,An Ode To The Anti-Party Anthem,Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anti-party-anthem_us_57057e2fe4b0b90ac2712769,I'll be over here.,2016-04-07,A group of models pretends to have fun while posing for a stock photo.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5706aa52150000ee010b44d8.jpeg?cache=cR0aLoj2nQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Are parties ~dead~?At the very least, they are dying, says The New York Times. In a September piece despairing the lack of festive gatherings held by people born roughly between 1985 and 2000, parties are on their way out due to the general social malaise caused by changes in technology, diets and rent. ""I’ve only been to a handful in my two years since [college]. My roommates and I never threw any parties, either,"" said one Brooklyn-based youth.This is because parties are literally the worst. Let's look very closely at scenes depicted in popular party songs.Has anyone actually found true love in the sweaty nightmare that is the club dance floor, as Usher and Pitbull wax lyrical about in ""DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love""? Or had a good time after seeing ""their girl"" positioned ""on my jock huh nonstop when we in the spot,"" as depicted in LMFAO's ""Party Rock Anthem""? How many women respond positively to a strange man opening with ""Hey, pretty girl,"" before comparing her physique to his automobile, as R. Kelly does in ""Ignition (Remix)""?If you're not dropping a couple on jewelry for your stripper girlfriend or otherwise shamelessly participating in gaudy displays of wealth as you're out with your friends, you're paying too much for kale and enough experimental craft beers to host everyone at your tiny home, as noted by the Times. Parties are terrible.Other songs offer more indisputably unpleasant results of going to parties. ""Where are my keys? I lost my phone,"" Lady Gaga cries in ""Just Dance."" ""Ripped my favorite party dress / Warrants out for my arrest,"" Katy Perry laments in ""Last Friday Night.""The foil to these extolments of party culture, of course, are anti-party anthems. Only a few presently exist, but as the party continues to die its rightful death, they will likely grow in number.In her cardinal hit ""Royals,"" millennial singer Lorde rolls her eyes at the ""gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom"" scenes described by other songwriters peddling lifestyles that make luxury brand leaders very happy. Courtney Barnett debates the benefits of going out or staying home with ""I'd rather stay in bed, with the rain over my head"" in her peppy ""Nobody Really Cares If You Don't Go to the Party."" Nineteen-year-old Alessia Cara is very clearly disinterested in the party she's stuck at in ""Here.""""I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room / With people who don't even care about my well-being,"" she sings. ""I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend / So you can go back, please enjoy your party / I'll be here.""Elsewhere, pop starlet Sia paints a wholly melancholic picture of party life in ""Chandelier,"" where she bottles her emotions and, claiming she's just ""holding on for tonight,"" suggests the next day will take a more sinister turn. Similarly, Mike Posner gives listeners a dire warning on excessive partying in ""I Took A Pill In Ibiza"": ""You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone / You don't wanna ride the bus like this / Never knowing who to trust like this.""Parties: Not even once.Or.Or maybe, sometimes you go to Paris and it's so disappointing that you need therapy, and sometimes you go to a party and it's so disappointing that you end up hanging out in a corner with the house pet. In any case, it's nice when music reflects the nuanced reality of social interaction. I don't know if the party is truly dying, as the Times prophesied last fall. Seeing as humans have gathered for drinks and merriment for centuries throughout history, including other periods of technological and socio-economic change, I have a feeling they'll stick around. Perhaps introverts are simply getting their time in the pop music spotlight. With so many hitmakers striving to write ""party anthems"" praising universal elements of good times -- again, and again and again -- hearing one anti-party anthem is like sipping a glass of ice water in a sea of room-temp Coors Light.

He also asked Sanders outright what Black Lives Matter means to him. ""What it means is that we are all sick and tired of seeing unarmed people shot by police officers,"" Sanders said. ""That young people in African-American communities are harassed by police officers, where police departments are not there to be supportive but are in many cases oppressive, and that's an issue that has to be addressed.""Black Lives Matter has galvanized a nationwide movement that has fought relentlessly to raise awareness around all of the issues Sanders mentioned, and more. While some millennial members of the movement support Sanders' bid for the presidency, the Vermont senator is still struggling to build momentum among older black voters who, so far, are more keen to vote for his opponent Hillary Clinton.Sanders spoke openly with Lee about this challenge and admitted he is ""getting killed, frankly, not just with older African-Americans but also older whites, older Latinos.""""It's the weirdest thing in the world,"" Sanders said. ""And what really bothers me is I spent half my life in Congress helping to lead the effort for senior citizens... so we have a lot of work to do in terms of reaching out to seniors, not just African-Americans, but seniors all across the board.

They have reported quotes from the audio but have not made it available online.According to a copy provided on Thursday by RadarOnline of the search warrant and an affidavit, the Los Angeles police investigation was triggered by Scottine Ross, a former porn star and fiancee of Sheen, who accused him in a December lawsuit of assault and of having sex with her without revealing he was HIV positive.Sheen announced in a November interview that he had been diagnosed with HIV about four years earlier, but said it was ""impossible"" that he had transmitted the virus to anyone else.According to the affidavit, Ross went to police fearing for her life after reading the initial RadarOnline.com and National Enquirer reports in March, which said that Sheen had made threats against Ross in calls to another unidentified woman.(Reporting by Jill Serjeant and Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Daniel Trotta and Bernadette Baum)"

In that time the actor says he's seen some progress when it comes to diversity on television but he feels networks could be doing more. The 36-year-old star spoke to The Huffington Post this week about wanting the TV industry to go beyond developing diverse pilots and how it felt to work with the cast of ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy"" during his recent guest appearance as patient Kyle Diaz.Valderrama acknowledges the ""major progress"" made by streaming services and networks for a more diverse TV landscape but says networks and studios are dropping the ball by not turning the diverse pilots they help develop into full series.""I think television has become a lot more ambitious when it comes to conceptualizing a show -- the tones, the universes, the characters, the premises, the stories,"" Valderrama told HuffPost. ""But I also have to admit that as much as they’re developing a lot of these pilots and as much as they’re developing a lot of vehicles for Latinos and African Americans, we’ve yet to see how many networks and how many studios are really willing to pick up these shows to series, and really get[ting] behind those shows and truly help[ing] them become a success.""And the actor is no stranger to the process of developing a series, Valderrama created and executive produced MTV's verbal sparring show ""Yo Momma"" in the mid-2000s. He also currently stars alongside Meagan Good in Fox's ""Minority Report,"" which premiered last fall but promptly had its season episode order cut from 13 to 10 due to low ratings. ""I think [networks'] intentions are in the right place, to try and develop as much diversity as possible,"" he said. ""But unfortunately I think a lot of networks lack a bit of that mojo, that courage to actually give those shows a real shot and allow audiences to really find themselves within the leading stories and the leading characters.""But ""Grey's"" creator Shonda Rhimes, he says, is a great example of those in the industry trying to change the game by conceptualizing series that revolve around not only women but people of color. And this Thursday, Valderrama will officially debut in a Shondaland original as musician and MS patient Kyle Diaz on ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy.""""You know a Shonda Rhimes show when you see it, that’s one thing that’s exciting: to be able to come into an existing universe that's all kind of intertwined in the same world,"" he told HuffPost about his time working on set.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have been trading shots about who is qualified to be president. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570662d3150000ee010b4449.jpeg?cache=fWTi119gSE&ops=crop_0_543_6010_2981%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"When talking to women rooting for Hillary Clinton, one reason comes up over and over again about why they stick by her: She is, simply, the most qualified person to be president. ""She's the most highly qualified candidate of the Republicans and the Democrats. She has the experience,"" New Hampshire state Rep. Mary Heath (D) said during a canvassing event in Manchester in January.""She's the most qualified, the smartest person. Her grasp of the issues is just amazing,"" agreed Kathy Sullivan, a former chairwoman of the state Democratic Party.Responses like those are why Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) recent comment that Clinton isn't qualified to be president have caused such a backlash with her supporters. Sanders' comments -- his sharpest criticism to date of his Democratic presidential primary opponent -- came during a speech he delivered Wednesday in Philadelphia. ""She has been saying lately that she thinks that I am, quote unquote, not qualified to be president,"" Sanders said. ""Well let me just say in response to Secretary Clinton: I don't believe that she is qualified if she is -- if she is, through her super PAC, taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds,"" he said. ""I don't think that you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your super PAC. I don't think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in Iraq.""Sanders also cited Clinton's support for ""virtually every disastrous trade agreement,"" and specifically the Panama Free Trade Agreement, as additional reasons why she is not qualified. Clinton never said Sanders is ""not qualified to be president,"" as the senator claimed. She did, however, repeatedly demur on questions about Sanders' qualifications during an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Wednesday. Clinton said his rough interview with the New York Daily News on April 1 showed that Sanders has been ""talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadn’t really studied or understood, and that does raise a lot of questions.""Sanders' criticisms of Clinton focused on her policy positions, but to many of her supporters they came off as a personal insult. ""There are policy disagreements he may have with her on some things. Let's stick to those,"" Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday. ""Let's not say that the most qualified candidate for president is simply unqualified. Frankly, I don't get that. And I think we've got to refrain from ad hominem attacks that -- there's a different way he could have put that.""Female Clinton supporters often get defensive when reporters ask them whether they're backing Clinton because she would be the first woman in the Oval Office. They stress that it's about her qualifications more than checking a box on the gender list. ""It's not only that she would be the first woman president,"" said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood. ""It's literally that she brings decades of experience in foreign policy, in domestic policy, in advocacy, and she would start day one in the White House knowing exactly what needs to be done.""And especially for many older supporters, they have heard throughout their lives that they're not as qualified as their male counterparts, and they relate personally to the struggles Clinton has faced -- the double-standards, the questions about her ambition and the focus on her appearance. In other words, if this woman -- who been first lady, a senator, secretary of state and spent years in the legal and advocacy worlds -- can't be president, what hope is there for any other woman? “Nothing can be tougher than having your boss tell you you can’t have the raise you deserve because the other guys are married and have kids,"" said Joni Salvas, 74, a Clinton volunteer in Manchester who had worked in manufacturing.""Hillary has been through that too, absolutely. But not as bluntly as I have,"" she added. Salvas said she eventually left that field because ""I don't have a military pension, I don't have a penis and I'm getting the hell out of this joint.""Sanders' comments sparked a pro-Clinton hashtag, #HillarySoQualified, where supporters expressed their outrage. (The hashtag eventually backfired, however, when anti-Clinton folks used it to tweet against her.) Sanders Campaign Manager Jeff Weaver stood by the senator's ""unqualified"" remarks in a CNN interview Thursday morning, saying, ""If you look at her campaign, her campaign is funded by millions and millions of dollars from Wall Street and other special interests. She really made a deal with the devil, and we all know the devil wants his money in the end.""On Thursday, Clinton brushed off Sanders' comments, calling them ""a silly thing to say.""Laura Barron-Lopez contributed reporting."
16,POLITICS,Lawsuit Aims To Keep Immigrants From Being Stuck In Detention Because They Can't Afford Bond,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-immigrant-detention-bond_us_5706769be4b0a506064e52f5,Civil rights groups say judges and immigration agents are setting bond amounts that some individuals can't pay.,2016-04-07,Attorney General Loretta Lynch was named in a lawsuit over bond fees for immigrants facing deportation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some asylum-seekers and immigrants in deportation proceedings are granted bond to leave detention while they seek relief to stay in the U.S. -- something that allows them to rejoin family and more easily find attorneys. It's a policy that costs taxpayers a lot less, and one immigrant rights advocates say is more humane. But some of the people granted bond can't leave because it's set too high for them to pay it, civil rights groups affiliated with the American Civil Liberties Union allege in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.The ACLU Foundation of Southern California, the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project and six pro bono attorneys filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. government, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. They contend that bond set by judges and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents should be made with consideration to what individuals can pay, so that people considered unlikely to abscond won't remain in detention while their deportation cases are pending. One plaintiff, a hairstylist named Cesar Matias, has been in detention for more than four years as he fights his deportation, even though immigration judges authorized him for release on a $3,000 bond on multiple occasions beginning in November 2012, the lawsuit states. Matias is a gay man seeking relief to stay in the U.S. based on a fear of persecution in his native Honduras and his appeal could take years, according to the lawsuit. Xochitl Hernandez, an undocumented woman from Mexico, remains in detention even though an immigration judge set her bond last month, according to the lawsuit. The suit states she is a mother of five and grandmother of four who has lived in the U.S. for more than 25 years, and has one criminal conviction from a decade ago: a shoplifting charge for which she was sentenced to one day in jail. The bail set by an immigration judge was $60,000, and she and her family can't pay it, according to the lawsuit. Immigration judges or enforcement officials are not required to consider an individual's ability to pay bond when setting a figure, and they did not ask Matias or Hernandez about their financial circumstances before determining their bond amounts, the suit says.The ACLU and pro bono attorneys allege in the suit that continuing to detain individuals who cannot pay is discriminatory and violates individuals' rights to due process. ""Poverty or lack of financial resources should not deprive a person of his or her freedom while in civil immigration proceedings,"" ACLU Foundation of Southern California attorney Michael Kaufman said in a statement. ""Such detention violates the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Bail Clause and immigration laws.""Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, can set bond amounts for individuals that require them to appear at future removal proceedings. Those decisions are made based on whether individuals are a flight risk and whether they have a criminal or immigration record, ties to the community or are otherwise eligible for bond, according to the agency. Immigrants can also appeal to the Executive Office for Immigration Review at the Department of Justice to grant them bond or lower their bond amounts. Immigration judges are instructed to consider the same factors: whether the immigrant is likely to appear at future immigration proceedings and whether they pose a danger to national security, property or people, according to a manual from the review office. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. The Department of Homeland Security does not comment on pending litigation, a spokeswoman said. "

19,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Has A General Election Pivot Problem,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-general-election_us_5705b019e4b0a506064e3089,"To start looking beyond the primaries or not? For Democrats, that is the question.",2016-04-07,The primary campaign has gone on longer than anticipated. And it's left party operatives worried that they're squandering general election chances.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton's loss to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in Tuesday's Wisconsin Democratic primary hasn't dramatically altered her still-favorable path to the nomination. But it has heightened concerns within the ranks of her campaign of losing a precious political commodity: time. Sanders' 13-point Wisconsin win ensured that his melee with Clinton will last at least through April, with its delegate-rich contests in New York and Pennsylvania. Absent Sanders blowouts in both of those states, the math for the nomination will remain quite advantageous for Clinton.But it likely won't be so clearly in Clinton's favor as to allow her campaign to turn attention and resources fully toward the general election. And increasingly, top Democratic operatives worry that the longer it takes for Clinton to make that full pivot, the more the party ends up squandering the tremendous hand it's been dealt.""Once you get into May, I think you've got to start having your state directors in place. You have got to start traveling to those [battleground] states. You've got to start communicating to voters in those states,"" said David Plouffe, who was Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager. ""Now, again, [the Clinton campaign] will make the decision. But having been through this, I think the one mistake you can make is start too late.""You can't wait till June 8 to start the general election,"" Plouffe added, referring to the day after the last primaries are held. ""That would be a feat of epic political malpractice."" Plouffe, who backs Clinton, has fairly unimpeachable credentials on the subject of general election pivots. While steering Obama's campaign in '08, he recalled feeling anxious that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) would use the months after he secured the nomination to effectively define the race before Democrats had chosen a nominee. Obama and Clinton were still tangled in their own primary. And the then-Illinois senator could ill-afford to look presumptuous, even with his delegate lead. A portion of Clinton supporters were, at the time, proudly disrupting Democratic events, calling the opposition a ""cult,"" and giving themselves the PUMA moniker: Party Unity My Ass. It was wild.But McCain didn't use his time well. And that, said Plouffe, ""was the gift that we were given."" Once Obama won in Indiana and North Carolina in early May, the campaign ""started traveling to battleground states that had already had their primaries,"" said Plouffe. ""We started to talk a lot more about the matchup between Barack Obama and John McCain."" Unless you've been comatose for the last eight years, you know how the rest went. Clinton now occupies the same position Obama did eight years earlier: a likely nominee, but not quite a presumptive one, and with a good chunk of her own party potentially aggrieved. Publicly, Clinton's aides are projecting a touch of nonchalance.""The month of March put us on a clear path towards the nomination, but the contests in New York and Pennsylvania have the potential to be even more decisive if Sanders fails to achieve significant victories there,"" said Brian Fallon, Clinton's spokesman. ""We expect that by the end of April, it will be undeniable that Sanders has run out of scenarios to overtake Hillary Clinton's delegate lead. It will be clear that she is going to the Democratic nominee.""Behind the poised facade, however, are real worries -- or at least hurried attempts to find the right balance. Clinton's talking points have grown far more specific to the general election in recent days. She has accused Donald Trump of being serially out of touch and has gone after Ted Cruz for being Trump's temperamental clone.But the attacks have been undertaken with one eye firmly elsewhere. Sanders' continued strength, and the slim but real chance that he gets a delegate tally allowing him to either win the nomination outright or persuade party insiders -- the so-called superdelegates -- to rethink their support of Clinton, makes him, basically, un-ignorable. So Clinton and her aides have kept at it, attacking Sanders with lines equal parts biting -- ""that he would place gun manufacturers' rights and immunity from liability against the parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook is just unimaginable to me,"" she told MSNBC on Wednesday -- and dismissive -- ""Senator Sanders had a good night last night,"" she said of his Wisconsin win, ""but if you look at the numbers, I am still considerably ahead."" The end result has been a weird, almost asymmetrical posture, with Clinton laying into a candidate that she simultaneously implies doesn't have a chance. But it's a tactic that campaign veterans say is unavoidable.""I think [the primary] really is effectively over, and I think the Clinton campaign has the dual problem of not taking the rest of the primary off and turning to the general,"" said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic strategist who, most famously, spearheaded Howard Dean's presidential campaign in 2004. ""Because once everyone thinks it is over, your opponent starts to win.""Trippi isn't speaking theoretically here. There is evidence, perhaps anecdotal, that insurgent campaigns do better when elections seem to just about crystalize. Clinton rolled up a number of wins late in the 2008 primary. And in 1992, California Gov. Jerry Brown, for whom Trippi worked, chased down Bill Clinton as it seemed Clinton was taking a firm grasp of the nomination. The insurrectionist camp doesn't want to give up, Trippi summarized, and the front-runner's backers get complacent. Clinton's allies aren't uniformly nervous about this trend as the campaign enters what can be described as a transition period. In fact, they believe that part of their mission entails picking up the general election slack as the former secretary of state tries to shore up the primary. They are even leaving open the possibility of accelerating their plans if that primary drags on longer than anticipated. ""We have been preparing for both Trump and Cruz since the fall of 2015 and will increasingly highlight both of their records in the press, online and ultimately on television,"" said Guy Cecil, who heads the Clinton-backing super PAC Priorities USA. ""While we have already reserved our fall television buy, we haven't ruled out going on the air prior to the convention.""But there is a distinction between a super PAC bearing the load and a campaign doing it. A campaign brings with it a more durable footprint: actual campaign staff doing actual campaign work, as opposed to television ad buys that, at this juncture, can have ephemeral effect. ""It is what the campaign does that matters most,"" said Plouffe. ""It is not even close.""One element of the campaign that works in favor of Clinton and Sanders (should he end up winning the nomination) is that while things may remain in flux on the Democratic side, there is sustained chaos in the Republican race. The need to quickly define the opposition is lessened when it's not exactly clear who the opposition will be -- or, when the opposition is doing a counterproductive job defining itself. That, at least, was the point made by a former Democratic governor who knows a thing or two about how candidates can be defined in a presidential election.""I am more concerned about our collective ability to take advantage of what is an extraordinary opportunity not only to win the presidency, but to take back the Congress and lots of other offices as well,"" said Michael Dukakis, who lost his run for president in 1988. ""We can't 'pivot' toward an opponent until we know who the Republican nominee is going to be, and that may take awhile.""I didn't lose because I didn't 'pivot' early enough. I lost because I made a decision not to respond to the Bush attack campaign, and in retrospect that was a pretty dumb decision."""

The ""Captain America: Civil War"" actress devotes most of her time and talking points to two issues that are important to women everywhere: the funding for Planned Parenthood and the battle for equal pay. ""There are countries at war, there’s terrorism, global warming, and we’re like, ‘We should definitely cut the budget for Planned Parenthood,'"" Johansson said, referencing GOP candidates that want to defund the reproductive health services organization. ""Let’s take away the availability of women’s health initiatives!'... It's nuts."" The 31-year-old actress explained that Planned Parenthood is used to help detect and prevent cervical and breast cancers and talked about the ways in which the nonprofit organization helped her growing up.""Growing up, I used [PP's] services. All my girlfriends did -- not just for birth control, but for Pap smears and breast exams."" Johansson said, adding ""You read about the rise of back alley-abortions, women having to mutilate themselves and teenagers having to seek help in unsafe conditions, and for what?! We’re moving backward when we’re supposed to be moving forward."" Amen to that. Johansson also carefully voiced her support for equal pay, a topic many actresses in Hollywood have spoken up about after Jennifer Lawrence wrote an essay devoted to sexism and wage gap in the industry.""I am very fortunate, I make a really good living, and I'm proud to be an actress who's making as much as many of my male peers at this stage,"" Johansson said. ""I think every woman has [been underpaid], but unless I'm addressing it as a larger problem, for me to talk about my own personal experience with it feels a little obnoxious. It's part of a larger conversation about feminism in general.""To read more of Johansson's interview with Cosmopolitan head here and look for a copy of the magazine on newsstands April 12. "
