0,PARENTING,My Formula for Relief: Why I Stopped Breastfeeding,"Whitney Fisch, Contributor
Social Worker/High School Counselor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-formula-for-relief-why-i-stopped-breastfeeding_us_5b9db4a2e4b03a1dcc8bbcec,"As I look back on my pregnant life, I can say that I was so set on this for my child that I had some pretty nasty judgments on women who bottle fed. In my mind, there was no other option. Why wouldn't you feed your baby something so pure?",2013-12-13,2013-12-09-1417515_10202669400962818_3815650_o.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-12-09-1417515_10202669400962818_3815650_o-thumb.jpg,"The day I stopped breastfeeding was like any other day to the rest of the world. The sun outside my Miami window continued to shine bright and insanely hot. Reruns of Entourage came on at 9:00 a.m. on E!, just like it had for the last three months or so. My mother continued calling me every couple of hours just to ""check in."" No one experienced any sort of real change except for me. After spending what felt like six months what was in actuality only 10 weeks, taking herbs, drinking teas, going to see lactation consultants, attending support groups and pumping until, quite literally, there was nothing left to pump, I felt, what can only be described as the greatest relief I have ever felt.I had always planned to breastfeed; it was the only expectation I had once my baby was born. I read up on everything I could regarding the subject. I proudly bought my breastfeeding cover a couple of weeks before my due date but I knew I wasn't going to use it. No, no, not me. For I wasn't just going to breastfeed my baby but I was going to be out and proud about it, no matter who felt uncomfortable with boob in public. I was going to be feeding my baby! In fact, and it's embarrassing to admit this now, but as I look back on my pregnant life, I can say that I was so set on this for my child that I had some pretty nasty judgments on women who bottle fed. In my mind, there was no other option. Why wouldn't you feed your baby something so pure? Wasn't it considered nutritional gold? Also, I mean, it's like free and stuff so that was good too. My daughter and me enjoying the sunrise this Fall.And then my daughter's birth day arrived. She weighed 8 lbs. and was perfect. I spent the first hour of her life with her on my chest -- skin to skin. She easily latched on to my breast and I was in heaven. Yet, as the days passed, she was losing weight and crying all the time. She cried so much. The generic label of ""colic"" was thrown around by a few folks. It was suggested by a family member that she might be a ""high-needs"" baby, whatever that meant. The suggestions by people with and without medical degrees were endless. All the while our baby was being ""diagnosed"" as a myriad of things, I was sinking further and further into a postpartum depression that I couldn't get out of. Our baby was barely sleeping two-hour stretches. Every two to three hours, I spent roughly an hour and a half feeding her and then pumping and yet still, I was producing minimal breast milk. I had spent a fortune on every homeopathic and herbal remedy suggested and nothing was working. I was crying all the time and barely eating. Most importantly, I wasn't connecting with my child. In my malnourished, sleep-deprived postpartum haze, I didn't have enough energy to attempt to bond with my baby. Everything I had was put into getting my body to produce milk.In my attempt for any kind of supportive connection, I reached out to the online community. I was reading every breastfeeding website and group chat I could find. ""Don't be a weanie,"" one very popular site posted, ""Breastfeed your toddler."" As I reached out for support and a community who might understand my devastation at not being able to breastfeed like I had expected, I felt more and more alienated. ""I don't want to be a 'weanie,'"" I thought, ""But what if I don't have a choice?"" You see, I knew it was coming, the inevitable suggestion to try formula.And then, it happened. After about two weeks of our daughter barely sleeping or gaining weight, our pediatrician made the suggestion of supplementing with formula. My heart sank as I sat there in disbelief. But, our kid needed to eat and so, later that day, while I sobbed next to him, my husband fed our baby girl her first bottle of formula. I couldn't believe we were feeding her formula. Wasn't formula the work of the devil? Turns out, no, it's not the work of the devil. The night of her receiving her first bottle of formula, our daughter slept five hours straight. And guess who else slept five hours? Me. I continued my regime of breastfeeding and pumping as well as tea-drinking and herb-taking all the while supplementing with formula. By the time I made the decision to go strictly to formula, I was netting a total of only four ounces of breast milk a day. Though that first night I slept the five hours, my life went right back into a cycle that barely gave me time to take care of myself. My feeding and pumping ritual took about two hours with each feed. I did this roughly eight times a day so that meant I was spending 16 hours of my day trying to get my body to do something it just couldn't do. I finally made the decision, in conjunction with my husband, to stop breastfeeding when our baby was 10-weeks-old. Though it was only 10 weeks, it felt like months and months. The days during those 10 weeks dragged on at a snail's pace while the nights were dark and endless. I looked at every day like an endless cycle of disappointment knowing that I was putting in all this work trying to get my body to work in a way that it just wasn't made to. When the decision was made to only use formula, my husband started taking over feedings and I started sleeping, which led to me eating healthy and taking care of myself. All of this meant I was getting to a place where I could finally start building a positive relationship with our daughter. She is now 16 months-old and incredibly healthy and happy. And me? I am now kicking myself for letting my preconceived notions of formula take over the first 10 weeks of my time with my newborn. Instead of becoming an advocate for breastfeeding, I became an advocate for just letting every mother do what they know is right for their baby. I hesitated the first couple times I mixed up some formula for her in public for fear of what other moms would think. But, I got over myself quickly. I will never get back those precious first weeks with my newborn. I spent those weeks in an unnecessary downward spiral of shame and guilt when I could have been connecting and loving my child and myself. It's a lesson I will take with me every day."
1,PARENTING,I'm a Mom Who Loves the iPad Bouncy Seat. Let's Make It Even Better!,"Andrea Bonior, Ph.D., Contributor
Psychologist, commentator, and author of ""Psychology: Essentia...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/im-a-mom-who-loves-the-ip_us_5b9db6e8e4b03a1dcc8be2e1,"Let's face it-- we live in a technological world, and babies need to be prepared for this from Day One.

No app is available to go with the trainer, but the idea is to keep the child on the toilet for as long as necessary by keeping them digitally entertained. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9db6e82100003100c5a260.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Let's face it-- we live in a technological world, and babies need to be prepared for this from Day One. What happens if your child starts preschool and he or she is behind because they have not yet developed crucial electronic life skills, like touching a screen at exactly the right angle? Or if they get to third grade and have wasted time on things like swimming or chopping fruit, and their index-finger-swiping speed is a nanosecond less than that of their video-literate/video-addled peers? And what about their social lives? What if they are ostracized at a video-game birthday party because someone mentions baseball and they run to get a glove rather than a Wii remote?That's right, it's crucial we start these kids early, and thank goodness for Fisher-Price. Their Newborn-to-Toddler Apptivity Seat for iPad has gotten a lot of flak from activists and some of those hippy-dippy parents who are all ""yadda yadda yadda fresh air blah blah blah social and emotional development blah blah blah good grief we're truly headed for a WALL-E society before the decade is even finished blah blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda boring boring boring,"" but I for one think it's fantastic. I applaud the Apptivity Seat -- and I actually don't think it goes far enough. Here are my suggestions for improvement, which will hopefully be incorporated into the next model:Remote Control: Currently, there is no remote control for the Apptivity Seat, but I am guessing that one is in the works. Come on, if I'm looking for my infant to have his own personal technological-entertainment complex, why the hell should I have to be the one to walk over and fiddle with it? I'm guessing babies won't be dexterous enough to swipe the screen themselves until a few months in -- again, parents, practice can help with this -- but I certainly don't want to have to get up from my own screen to start a new video on theirs. I'm thinking now about a basic, simple parental remote. It's a no-brainer, and perhaps can be added in the next few weeks. Maybe in time we could help the kids' independence by having them be able to do it themselves -- how cool would it be to get all Matrix-y and have the baby be able to toggle between videos with their pupil movements or even their heartbeat? Am I right?Blinders: In its current design -- and I'm guessing this is an oversight -- there is still a possibility that the baby might occasionally take his or her eyes off the iPad screen. Seriously uncool! Imagine the distraction and loss of focus if she was to encounter something like a bird moving outside a window, light bouncing off the walls from a chandelier or -- for a worst-case scenario -- a three-dimensional human face in an actual three-dimensional environment. Apparently, babies are wired to seek out real-life faces because it helps them learn some crap about emotional expression or something. So, parents, they're going to try to do it, and we need to be prepared. I'd recommend either a darkening box that encloses just their heads and the screen, or perhaps some of those blinders that those old-timey horses wear, which might be more cost-effective. Leg straps and hand restraints: I know it's not a pleasant topic, but babies kick. I'm not trying to accuse anybody's baby in particular, but I do think all babies do it at least once. They've also been known to wave their hands around in that off-putting way that looks like they're the lone survivor of some Dutch Electronica rave from 1997. Frankly, I'm surprised that the Apptivity Seat has not done more to stop these activities, which decidedly do not pass muster as ""App""tivities. Granted, the sedating effects of the screen are a positive step in that direction, but I do think physical restraints will help much further. Did I ever tell you about the time my daughter stretched her arms and was so fascinated by it that she did it several hundred more times? Or how my baby son would kick his legs for what felt like months on end? Good grief -- I'm exhausted for them just thinking about it. There are plenty of videos of other kids stretching their arms and kicking their legs to load onto the iPad, and watching those is more than enough. Some nice, comfy limb restraints -- I'm thinking a cashmere version for the luxe parents out there? Maybe leather for the toddler-thong market? -- would help keep this from happening. Earbuds: Another weakness of the Apptivity Seat is that it doesn't completely drown out sounds from outside the screen. I know, I know, those know-it-all scientists will tell you that screen time has been associated with a lag in verbal development in part because the background noise of the electronics makes it harder for babies and toddlers to distinguish the real-life vocalizations around them. But these white-coat whackjobs miss the point -- we can just negate those problems by making sure our kids never hear noises other than the stuff coming from the screen in the first place! Added bonus: by tuning out the rest of the world, we we'll also avoid that creepy startle response babies sometimes get -- ever seen one of those? (Shudder.) So, I'm thinking some small earbuds, maybe in cute pops of color? Cheetah prints, or maybe a sleek metallic -- are you feeling me? Some audiologists -- I think that's the word -- have told me that this might be associated with damaging kids' hearing, but, um, hello????! We can just keep turning up the volume if need be! Intravenous feeding: A lot of parents are excited about the iPotty for helping potty-train kids who can't be bothered to try to poo or pee unless we entice them with video entertainment. I think this was a problem in caveman times, as well. Now have we forgotten that there are also kids who don't want to eat? I'm surprised people haven't yet put two and two together about just how revolutionary the Apptivity Seat can be for feeding time! After all, if we don't prepare our kids to shovel in food-that's-barely-recognizable-as-food while staring at multiple screens like their grown-up counterparts do, we're doing them a disservice in today's world. Don't tell me you haven't worried about it too. And alarmingly, by the time today's babies start solids it might already be too late. So, hear me out -- I'm picturing a bottle holder for the liquid phase -- we could make it all retro, like an actual hand, or what about something cushier like those wire monkey mothers from that old psych study? Of course, when they hit the age for solid food, I know what you're thinking -- the potential mess. I've heard that babies tend to use feeding time as a means of sensory exploration and discovery, which obviously can be devastating for electronics. I need to consult with a few gastroenterologists, but I do think that a simple feeding tube is the answer (and can perhaps be combined with the pottying aspect as well. What goes in has to come out -- and why not streamline the process?)An additional screen: Naturally, since one screen is such a judicious and intelligent idea, a second screen would double the benefits. What if the child gets antsy with what is on the one screen? Apparently, babies and children occasionally get bored -- trust me, I've heard about it, and it's a dangerous and unnatural mood state that can have devastating consequences, especially in disrupting parents from their own screen time. We can combat this by making sure to throw entertainment at our babies and children at all times; I wish it was seen as important as nap time, but we're getting there. Yes, some of those crunchy freaks who still let their kids dig in real dirt (I've found a good dirt app, by the way -- ping me!) might even try to argue that boredom is a natural catalyst for creativity, and that learning to sit alone with one's thoughts and daydream and come up with ways to entertain themselves is a life skill that will make them less likely to suffer attentional problems and depression later on, but we've got plenty of pills for that stuff. So don't waste your time worrying about those conditions. In fact, that reminds me! Perhaps the future Apptivity model, hopefully expanded to the school-aged set, can have a... medication dispenser!Andrea Bonior, Ph.D., is a psychologist and media commentator.

To help you determine your next shopping destination, the members and editors of travel website VirtualTourist.com (http://www.virtualtourist.com) compiled a list of the ""Top Ten Christmas Markets.""1. Vienna, AustriaAdvent, the period of preparation before Christmas, begins on the Sunday four weeks before Christmas Eve, so Viennese celebrations and decorations often begin in mid-November. Rathausplatz, the square in front of the city hall, is home to Christkindlmarkt, a traditional Christmas market with more than 150 stalls selling gifts, Christmas decorations, gluhwein (mulled wine) and hot chestnuts. Two other popular Christmas venues are the Old Viennese Christmas Market on Freyung, which is more traditional and sells handicrafts, and the Christmas Market in front of Schonbrunn Palace, which offers the imperial backdrop and hosts a New Year's market, staying open until January 1. The market on the Rathausplatz runs from Nov 16 at 5 pm to December 24 - other markets around the city on average run from around Nov 20 - Dec 23. 2. Salzburg, AustriaOne of Europe's oldest markets, the Christkindlmarkt in front of the Salzburg cathedral is a more intimate affair than some of the larger city's markets. The town's baroque architecture and looming Hohensalzburg Fortress give it a fairy tale feeling, heightened by the sparkling lights and holiday garlands. As the birthplace of Mozart, Salzburg has an outstanding musical tradition, so there are wonderful choral performances and opportunities to hear some of Europe's best students perform. In fact, the city also has another musical claim to fame: Joseph Mohr, the lyricist behind the famous Christmas carol ""Silent Night"" was also born in Salzburg.3. Munich, GermanyWhile many people associate the Bavarian capital with Oktoberfest, Munich also holds a fantastic Christmas market in the center of the city on the Marienplatz. The market surrounds an enormous Christmas tree, which glitters with almost 2,500 lights. While sipping on gluhwein (mulled warmed wine) or beer, visitors can find many traditional Bavarian gifts, like wood carvings and gingerbread called lebkuchen. There are also smaller themed markets throughout the city - one unique to Munich is the Manger Market, which sells the pieces and important components for those who want to build an authentic manger. 4. Prague, Czech RepublicThe two best Vanocni trhy (Christmas markets) are held in the Old Town Square and on the long slope of Wenceslas Square. While the markets do feature the expected wooden toys and holiday decor, they also sell Czech specialties, like glasswork, blacksmith's wares, and ceramics. The food is also slightly different from the German standard: although blood sausages, gingerbread, and grog are offered, there are also vendors with corn on the cob and trdelnik (cooked dough with cinnamon and sugar). If you are in town around December 20, you will start to see carp offered frequently - dining on the fish is a Christmas Eve tradition in Prague.5. Dresden, GermanyA new addition to this year's Christmas markets list, multiple VirtualTourist members suggested that Dresden, Germany is a must visit for market lovers. The Striezelmarkt on Dresden's Altmarkt Square is one of Germany's oldest fairs with a particularly unique setting - the town erects a 48-foot- (14.6 m-) high wooden ""Christmas Pyramid"" in the centre of the market. The market's name is derived from stollen, the Christmas bread, which is also known as striezel in this area of Germany. In addition to this delicacy, the area is also known for the pflaumentoffel, a good-luck charm made from dried plums, and famous for its handicrafts that come from all over Saxony. 6. Strasbourg, FranceFor centuries, the French-German border has swayed to either side of the Alsace region, so it makes sense Alsace's capital, Strasbourg, would have the oldest and most famous Christmas market in France, the Christkindelsmärik on Place Broglie. The city's Great Christmas Tree on Place Kleber is also a spectacle that shouldn't be missed. In addition to the spiced wine usually offered at Christmas markets, markets in Strasbourg have a tradition of spicy hot orange juice. The markets are also a great chance to try some of the region's food products, including Alsace wines, bredle Christmas biscuits and foie gras. 7. Budapest, HungaryLocated on Vorosmarty ter (Vorosmarty Square) in the Pest district of Budapest, the city's Christmas fair is a great opportunity to experience traditional Hungarian food, folk dances and live music. A VirtualTourist member mentioned that one aspect she enjoyed was the variety of hot drinks, including a spicy hot apple juice and hot chocolate punch, and the chance to try Hungarian baked goods, like langos (fried bread with a variety of toppings) strudels and toki pompos (oven-baked dough). It is also a great spot to shop for handmade items, as the city has an association which checks products for quality and authenticity and certifies all items sold at the market.8. Lille, FranceAlong France's northern border and the capital of French Flanders, it makes sense that Lille would have great activities during the holiday season. Around the Christmas market, the whole town is covered in a huge crown of garlands. The city's primary market is located on Place Rihour, where 80 wooden chalets teem with gift ideas, nativity figurines, Christmas decorations and festive food. On the nearby Grand Place, a 50-m (165-ft) high Big Wheel lights up the square and provides visitors with an amazing view of the city. As a city with Eurostar direct services, visiting Lille is an easy stop whether you are en route to Paris, Brussels, or London.9. Bruges, BelgiumIn prior lists, we've featured Brussels as our Belgian Christmas Market stop, but the city of Bruges was mentioned by multiple VirtualTourist members as a holiday stop to make sure to hit this year. In addition to being surrounded by the city's spectacular medieval architecture, Bruges's Christmas Market is distinguished by the ice rink erected in the Markt. For children, the city also hosts a Snow & Ice Sculpture Festival, and it is only a five minute walk from the Christmas Market and skating rink.10. London, EnglandIn addition to London's renowned Christmas decorations, there are great markets and activities on either side of the Thames during the holiday season. The Southbank Centre Christmas Market features 80 wooden cabins selling gifts, mince pies, gluhwein, and bratwurst to enjoy while you stroll along the waterfront. Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park is probably the best known market in London - it has more than 200 wooden chalets offering handmade gifts and decorations. The food and drink selection at Winter Wonderland is the most extensive of any spot on the list, with options including a Bavarian village, an outdoor fire pit, and even a bar modeled after an alpine ski lodge. In addition to the food and shopping, Winter Wonderland offers a 60-m (197-ft) high Observation Wheel, Britain's largest ice rink and carnival rides. Another option for ice skating is the Skate at Somerset House Ice Rink, which has DJs spinning the tunes after dark.(Editing by Michael Roddy)"

The suit alleges copyright and trademark infringement, false advertising, false endorsement and unfair competition.“Unfortunately, rather than developing an original advertising campaign to inspire its customers to create and innovate, GoldieBlox has instead developed an advertising campaign that condones and encourages stealing from others,” the counterclaim reads.Earlier, GoldieBlox replaced the song when it became aware that late Beastie Boy Adam Yauch requested that their music never be used in advertisements. But before doing so, the company filed the initial lawsuit seeking a declaration that the song was a parody of the original work and therefore fair use.GoldieBlox’s new lyrics are a 180 from the Beastie Boys’ original message. “Girls, to do the dishes / Girls, to clean up my room” is replaced with “Girls, to build a spaceship / Girls, to code a new app” as part of the company’s mission to empower girls as inventive future engineers.But parodying the Beastie Boys’ message may not be enough for a judge to consider the sales pitch as fair use.“GoldieBlox probably doesn't have the right to use the song,"" attorney and intellectual property expert Jonathan Moskin told the San Jose Mercury News. ""They may be commenting on the misogynistic lyrics of the Beastie Boys, but in doing that, clearly their motive is to sell their own toys.""The video reached over 8 million views and made it one of the most popular toy lines on Amazon, Variety reported.But other legal experts note that while the video is an advertisement, it’s for a company with a goal much bigger than raking in revenue.“The greater message is, ‘Let's rethink how we stereotype what's a girl's role, or what a girl's product might be,’” said Julie Ahrens, director of Copyright and Fair Use at Stanford’s Center for Internet and Society. “So this product itself has its own social goal as well. So I think that gives the GoldieBlox some real ammunition in a fair use argument … And frankly, as far as whether it’s commercial or not, they aren't selling a CD that's competing with the Beastie Boys music.” "

We shall get there someday.--A.A. Milne (1882-1956)I recently cruised the Viking Waterways of the Czars excursion from St. Petersburg, Russia to Moscow on this, the largest fleet of river vessels in the world. Our Ports of Call took in cultural and historic landmarks and the onboard lectures and language lessons were enriching. Russia has a long and fascinating history with a diverse population of 143 million, spectacular natural beauty, great art and architecture, and a superb culinary tradition. It's the world's largest country with broad plains, tundras, vast coniferous forests and soaring mountains. Our leisurely cruise wandered through a kaleidoscope of small villages and towns to weave a tapestry at once intriguing and alluring. City of White Nights Ah! St. Petersburg! Known as Peter the Great's Window to the West, ""this city's wide and gracious boulevards are made for strolling and its 200 miles of waterways (albeit man-made) inspire comparisons with Venice or Amsterdam. Designed on a grand scale it is as though one walked through a city built for giants,"" mused Lewis Carroll in his 1867 diary. Of course the first stop on everyone's sightseeing list: the Hermitage. Catherine the Great's passion for art and beauty transformed the Winter Palace into one of the world's most splendid museums. Among the more than 1,000 rooms are 3,000,000 exhibits and displays, a staggering collection from ancient Egyptian to early 20th century art. In the Italian galleries I was particularly taken with a small work, DaVinci's Madonna and Child. Profound and noble, it depicts the Madonna tenderly gazing down at her son while in the background, a landscape of distant mountains and blue skies add a tranquil tone. Moving into the 19th-20th century galleries, I was drawn to Picasso's Three Women, one of the artist's most important cubist works. He turned the traditional subject of the Three Graces into a refined study done in red and brown earth tones. Possibly my very favorite object in the Hermitage was its Golden Peacock. For more than two centuries, the Hermitage has housed a unique exhibit that never fails to evoke enchanted admiration from visitors -- the famous Peacock Clock. It consists of figures made of gold, a peacock, a cockerel and an owl, that form part of this elaborate timepiece-automaton fitted with mechanisms that set them in motion. I was captivated by its slow, precise movements as the peacock seemed to come alive. Oh to have a year to spend in the Hermitage and maybe -- just maybe -- see the rest of its mind-blowing collection. Tell me, who among us would visit St. Petersburg without attending a ballet? The Mariinsky Ballet, having produced world-famous dancers since its inception in the 18th century, was just the ticket! We saw a performance of Giselle and the next day, traveled to Peterhof, the summer palace of the czars, 20 miles from the city's center where we set eyes on its world-famous dancing fountains and gold-plated sculptures. Finally, we said adieu to The Venice of the North, hoping to someday return and experience the other many treasures this scintillating city has to offer.The Golden Ring At embarkation, the river welcomed us with crisp, clear weather as we began our cruise following the Volga-Baltic Waterway, a 700-mile complex system of natural lakes, rivers, artificial reservoirs and canals that link the Volga with the Baltic Sea. The landscape continually changed, from meadows, soaring mountains and deep fir forests to small settlements and dachas (villas) that dotted the banks. We had the chance to visit quaint Golden Ring towns northeast of the capital - Ports of Call like Mandrogy, a town that had burned down in the 1940's and in 1996 was rebuilt into a popular Disney-like tourist village with farmsteads, horse-drawn hayrides, stables and horses. Tramping around the grounds in the cold and damp, a deep chill set in so we hopped on a horse and buggy ride directly to their Vodka Museum (offering samples!) -- a chance to warm up in more ways than one!On to Kizhi Island in the center of Lake Onega with churches and settlements that date to the 15th century. It's made up of dozens of historical wooden buildings that have been moved here for preservation. The entire island forms a national open air museum with more than 80 historical structures; in 1990, it was included on UNESCO's list of World Heritage sites. We wandered into an 1880 farmhouse that contained everything a family of that day would need: a living room/bedroom, a cattle shed, and a hay loft. The entire family lived together in one large room and in winter they were frequently joined by their farm animals -- the extra warmth very welcome! The city of Yaroslavl stretches for 18 miles on both banks of the Volga and is renowned for its numerous 17th century churches. The highlight of this Port of Call was visiting the Church of Elijah the Prophet containing walls covered with frescoes, constituting a veritable museum of Old Russian paintings. Here also is the Governor's Mansion which houses the Yaroslavl art museum. Spread across many palatial rooms is an impressive collection of 18th-20th century Russian paintings.In Uglich, we had the fun opportunity to visit a typical home. The gracious lady of the house served us a repast of bread, pickles, cold cuts and vodka. Her tiny bungalow was neat and pretty, the walls papered with photographs of family members.Moscow on my Mind If I had to think where I could live if not Moscow, London would be my first choice and second would be New York,"" the oligarch Roman Abramovich tells us. Of course! Expensive cities, all, but then for Mr. Abramovich, 5th richest man in Russia, 50th richest in the world, hет проблем -- no problem! His sentiments, however, are spot-on because Moscow is a world-class city in every respect. I mean, just think: Red Square, the Bolshoi Theatre, the insanely quirky St. Basil's Cathedral, dream-like parks to wander through, romantic night lights that play on the Volga, and -- the Kremlin! How's that for an exciting lineup? One of the highlights of my visit (no, really!) was a spin on the Moscow Metro. World-famous, it has elegant, stunningly lit stations, not to mention sculpture, huge chandeliers and gilded details. MTA, I'll never see you in quite the same light again!Another over-the-top stop for me, intrepid shopper that I am, was the glorious GUM department store. Its ornate Neo-Russian façade takes up nearly the entire eastern side of Red Square and looks far more like a palace than a department store. A consumer mecca for visitors to Moscow, the top floor was, during the time of the Soviet Union, a secret clothing store for only the highest echelon of the party. Today, the exclusive boutiques are accessible to anyone with a platinum card. That said, the building itself is fabulous and on the higher floors, there are still some interesting relics of days gone by that make it well worth exploring. From medieval citadel to modern power center, Moscow's Kremlin has played a dominant role in Russia for over 800 years. Majestic and picturesque, it's the chief architectural wonder of the city with mighty walls, soaring towers and an eclectic mix of architecture that reflects all the paradoxical shifts of this fascinating country. Today, the Kremlin remains as alluring as ever, a mixture of lavishness and austere secrecy. Two-thirds of the citadel territory is closed to visitors but the remaining third contains enough treasures to occupy several days of sightseeing. One of the oldest museums in Moscow and part of the Kremlin is the Armory, a staggering treasure-house replete with ancient Russian regalia, ceremonial tsars' dress, church hierarchs' vestments, gold and silverware by Russian, European and Eastern masters, arms and armories, and royal carriages. Objects such as rings, bracelets, and pendants by Old Russian masters spoke to my love of antique jewelry.Turning a corner, I found a virtual treasure-trove of precious textiles, ornamental embroidery, suits of armor and secular garments from the 16th to the early 20th century. Viewing some of Peter the Great's sumptuous caftans set my head spinning. I collapsed on a nearby bench to settle myself and ponder the glorious riches that I'd just experienced. It was at that moment that it dawned on me: I'm in the Armory Museum ...in the Kremlin...in Russia... and this is the end of a wonderful week cruising Russia's rivers and having encounters only possible on a slow, unhurried meander down a lazy river to Moscow. I wouldn't have it any other way!"
