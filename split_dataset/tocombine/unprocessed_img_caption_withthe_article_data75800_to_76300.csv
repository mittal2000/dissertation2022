2,SPORTS,Sunday Was Filled With An Abnormal Number Of Ridiculous NFL Plays,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/awesome-nfl-plays-week-five_us_561bb7d1e4b0082030a319da,It wasn't just you that was thinking it.,2015-10-12,Cleveland Browns tight end Gary Barnidge nabs the touchdown in Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561bb9661400006f003c7f98.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NFL pundits may not have pegged the Cleveland Browns-Baltimore Ravens matchup as the game to watch over the weekend, but Browns tight end Gary Barnidge's instantly classic “butt catch” shot the contest to the top of the highlight reel.That's impressive, considering Sunday was filled with an unusually high number of ridiculous plays on the football field. Let us count the amazing plays. 1. Gary Barnidge pulls off the ""butt catch"" Calling up memories of the 2012 Mark Sanchez “butt fumble,” Barnidge used just about every limb of his body to corral a soaring pass from quarterback Josh McCown for the touchdown.Right hand, left ankle, right thigh, squeezed between his legs and into his hands, this catch had -- and touched -- it all, leading the Twitterverse to debate whether it outranks even New York Giant Odell Beckham Jr.’s one-handed miracle grab from last season as the greatest catch in recent memory.2. Larry Donnell grabs the lob, grabs the winAbout 190 miles to the northeast of Barnidge’s butt catch, a game-winning toss from Giants quarterback Eli Manning to tight end Larry Donnell sent already emotional New York fans into a frenzy.Manning stepped back, looked up and lobbed a pass over the heads of two San Francisco 49er defenders deep into the end zone, into the outstretched arms of a leaping Donnell.3. Dion Lewis leaves no Cowboy ankle unbroken ...Elsewhere in the red zone, New England Patriots running back Dion Lewis put on a clinic on stutter steps, jabbing and juking, as he tricked out a handful of Dallas Cowboy defenders before barreling headfirst in for the touchdown. 4. ... Neither does Julian EdelmanMaybe Lewis learned some of those moves from teammate wide receiver Julian Edelman, who had yet another Cowboy defender falling head over heels with his fancy footwork around the 50-yard line.5. James Jones keeps running and the Packers keep rollingAnd it wouldn’t be an NFL Sunday without a highlight from Wisconsin favorite Aaron Rodgers, as the Green Bay signal caller found wide receiver James Jones, who skipped his way down the field for the 65-yard score. Have a day, receivers and running backs, have a day.Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders' surging poll numbers and record-breaking crowds have convinced his party's grassroots base to take him more seriously as a viable nominee, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey of Democratic activists finds. But the shift may not be enough to make him the first choice of party activists, among which Hillary Clinton still holds a diminished advantage. And, as the Democratic candidates prepare for their first debate this week, both Clinton and Sanders face added complications from Vice President Joe Biden's possible entry into the race.To better understand the ""invisible primary"" among party insiders, The Huffington Post has been working with our survey partner YouGov to scour its Internet survey panel for activist Democrats: those who have run for or held office, served as party officials, worked on campaigns or volunteered their time before elections. Our second survey of 500 of these activists provides a look at the opinions of some of the Democrats' best-informed and most politically involved supporters. (We also sampled and reported on Republican activists separately.)As we found in July, activist Democrats are far more informed and engaged in the campaign than ordinary voters, and far more decided than their Republican counterparts. Four out of five Democratic activists (82 percent) now say they have a good idea of who they'll vote for, compared to just 42 percent of Republicans. The current snapshot of activist opinion shouldn't be considered a prediction of who will end up winning. For one thing, as we found in July, the Democratic activists surveyed are significantly more liberal and white than the party as a whole. But it may provide a better snapshot of where the campaigns stand right now than polls of the wider but less engaged Democratic electorate.Demographically speaking, the kind of Democrats included in this survey should be exactly the kind of people to rally around Sanders. The Vermont senator has gained support among 44 percent of the activists (up from 37 percent in July) and halved Clinton's lead from 17 to 8 percentage points. For the moment, all of the other candidates combined have won over just 8 percent combined. Yet without Biden in the race, Clinton maintains the support of a slim majority of Democratic activists (52 percent), with most of the rest (44 percent) supporting Sanders. When Biden is included in the polling, the vice president gains the support of 16 percent of the activists, taking a larger bite out of support for Clinton (which falls to 42 percent) than for Sanders (38 percent). Should Biden choose to run, a significant portion of grassroots activists will have a tougher choice to make. While Clinton is still viewed as the most viable candidate -- 90 percent think she can win the nomination, and 84 percent say she can win the general election -- activists' skepticism that Sanders has a shot at the presidency has waned since the summer. In July, 49 percent of the activists believed Sanders could win the nomination, and just 36 percent thought he could win the general election. In the most recent survey, those numbers jumped to 60 percent and 49 percent, respectively.Eighty-eight percent of Sanders' supporters now think he's capable of becoming the next president, up 17 points since July. By contrast, while more than 40 percent of Clinton's backers now think Sanders could prevail in the primary, fewer than 1 in 4 think he could defeat a Republican rival.Biden, who wasn't included in the earlier activist survey, is also widely seen as electable, scoring somewhere between Sanders and Clinton on both measures. Seven in 10 Democrats think Biden could win the nomination, and 64 percent think he could win the presidency. Democrats' relative optimism about their leading contenders' chances contrasts markedly with the more fractured Republican primary, in which no candidate is seen by more than 53 percent of GOP activists as capable of winning the general election.Democratic activists also give sky-high favorability ratings to all three leading candidates: 86 percent for Clinton, 88 percent for Sanders, and 91 percent for Biden, numbers that have changed little since the summer. Most also are prepared to rally behind whomever ends up getting the nod. Just 16 percent would be upset if any of those three candidates were nominated and only 14 percent say they personally wouldn't be able to support one of them for president.In contrast, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee remain largely nonentities, polling at about a combined 1 percent support among the activists. (Larry Lessig, who's polling at a consistent 0 percent in national averages, was not included in the survey.)O'Malley is rated favorably by half of those surveyed, while Chafee and Webb draw more mixed reviews. Nearly a quarter of Democrats would be unhappy to see one of them named as the nominee.Although the Democratic side of the race looks considerably more settled than the GOP campaign, one very big uncertainty remains: Will Biden join in? If he doesn't, Clinton will maintain an advantage among the party's most highly engaged, mostly liberal, mostly white activists. If he does, among the activists, those preferences will narrow. The survey consists of 500 completed interviews of self-identified Democrats selected from YouGov's opt-in online panelists who met the screening criteria for party activism. Interviews were conducted Sept. 22-28, 2015. Full results of the survey are here and crosstabulations are here.The screening criteria were as follows: Respondents who think of themselves as Democrats, say they would vote in a Democratic primary in their state and say they have either run for office, held elected public office, been a paid staffer for a political campaign or elected official, been a party official or substantively contributed time or money to a campaign.For weighting purposes, a sampling frame was created based on the American National Election Studies using similar measures of political activism.

5,POLITICS,Charles Koch Denies Dark Money Donations,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charles-koch-dark-money_us_561c15b1e4b0dbb8000f879f,The oil billionaire says he's disclosed all of his political contributions.,2015-10-12,"Multibillionaire Charles Koch claims that he's disclosed all of his political donations, despite his involvement in an extensive network of politically active nonprofits that do not disclose their donors.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561c17cf1200002e007e4eaf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Multibillionaire Charles Koch appeared on CBS Sunday to push back against accusations that he and his brother, David Koch, are financing and organizing a massive political operation to support conservative and libertarian politicians and policies.During the interview with CBS correspondent Anthony Mason, Koch said allegations that he's failed to disclose political activity to the public are “vicious” and “dishonest.”“First of all, what I give isn't 'dark.' What I give politically, that’s all reported,” he said. “It’s either to PACs or to candidates. And what I give to my foundations is all public information.”This statement, however, is an almost impossible pill to swallow. Koch has indeed made publicly disclosed contributions of more than $580,000 to federal political parties, candidates and political action committees since 1997, according to Federal Election Commission records. In 2014, he also contributed $5 million to his Freedom Partners Action Fund super PAC, which must disclose its donors. But Koch and his brother are best known for the network of nonprofits they operate and raise money for that do not disclose their donors. These include grant distribution hubs like Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, Center to Protect Patient Rights and TC4 Trust. The three groups have distributed more than $450 million in grants to other nonprofits, many of them active in elections, since 2009, according to nonprofit tax forms compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a 501(c)(6) trade association that hosts the Koch brothers' annual donor summit, is currently the only hub that remains operational and is still affiliated with the Koch brothers.Nonprofit tax forms also reveal that the large majority of these grants went to Koch-connected groups that have spent money on elections, like Americans for Prosperity, American Energy Alliance, Concerned Veterans for America, Generation Opportunity and The LIBRE Initiative. Other major recipients included big election spenders like 60 Plus Association, American Future Fund, Americans for Job Security, Republican Jewish Coalition and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Is it likely, or even possible, that Charles Koch does not donate any money to these groups himself? Koch Industries did not respond to a request for comment, but a website they operate does provide an answer.“Among the hundreds of organizations that have received monetary support from Koch companies, Charles Koch, David Koch, and/or the Koch foundations are Americans for Prosperity and Americans for Prosperity Foundation,” a page on KochFacts.org states.Americans for Prosperity has been the most politically active of all the nonprofit groups in the Koch orbit. Since 2011, the Virginia-based 501(c)(4) nonprofit has spent $37 million on express electoral expenses and tens of millions more on issue advertising targeting political candidates.Documents reported on by the Center for Media and Democracy showed that David Koch contributed $1 million to Americans for Prosperity in 2001 and $850,000 in 2003. Koch Industries donated $902,500 in 2000 and $952,000 in 2001 to Americans for Prosperity.It's not clear how much of the money raised by the Koch political network comes from Charles and David Koch, and how much comes from the few hundred wealthy donors who contribute to their suite of nonprofit groups.In his opening remarks to a room of potential donors in August, Charles Koch compared his libertarian vision to the past efforts of abolitionists and suffragists. ""We too are seeking to right injustices that are holding our country back,"" Koch told attendees.""Now this is a cause I believe we can all fully commit to,"" he continued. ""And I've made that commitment. I hope you will join me. The future of our country depends on it.""In the CBS interview, Koch defended donors' desire to keep their contributions secret.“[A] lot of our donors don't want to take the kind of abuse that I do,” Koch said. “They don't want these attacks, they don't want the death threats. So they aren't going to participate if they have to have their names associated with it.”When Mason asked Koch on CBS if it was fair or healthy in a democracy for a small number of wealthy individuals to dominate political funding, he replied, “Listen, if I didn't think it was healthy or fair I wouldn't do it, because what we're after is to fight against special interests.""Apparently, Koch doesn't believe the phrase “special interests"" applies to him.“[M]y interest is -- just as it’s been in business -- is, what will help people improve their lives?"" he continued. ""And to get rid of these special interests, that's the whole thing that drives me.”"
6,MEDIA,McClatchy Closing Foreign Bureaus Amid Reorganization In Washington,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mcclatchy-closing-foreign-bureaus_us_561bbf30e4b0dbb8000f1f0b,The newspaper chain is shifting its focus to regional and political news.,2015-10-12,"Anders Gyllenhaal, McClatchy's Washington editor and vice president of news, sent a memo to staff on Monday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561bc1741200002e007e4dd0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- The McClatchy newspaper chain will shutter its remaining four foreign bureaus as its Washington bureau reorganizes to focus on regional stories and political coverage, the company announced Monday. The Huffington Post reported Friday that McClatchy was planning to close its bureaus in Beijing, Mexico City, Istanbul and Berlin. The company will also discontinue the work of a stringer who had been reporting regularly from Irbil, Iraq.""Today, we’re announcing an important shift in the mission of the Washington bureau to focus above all on regional and political coverage, as well as national stories of particular impact in our communities,"" Anders Gyllenhaal, McClatchy's Washington editor and vice president for news, wrote in a memo. ""These changes better align the bureau with McClatchy’s overall news strategy and more directly support our newsrooms with the kind of high quality journalism McClatchy stands for.""Rather than being laid off, the company's full-time foreign correspondents will return to the U.S., according to the memo. In the past, McClatchy has operated bureaus in major cities such as Moscow, Kabul and Baghdad.McClatchy -- which operates more than 30 newspapers nationwide, including The Miami Herald, Kansas City Star, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Sacramento Bee and Charlotte Observer -- faces the same challenges that other newspaper companies do, including steep drops in demand for ads and shifts in the way people consume news. The company bought the larger Knight Ridder chain for $4.5 billion in 2006, and has been increasingly investing in digital and video initiatives. For instance, it plans to add two dozen staffers to its video team in Washington. Other planned additions are a ""strike force"" to pursue enterprise and developing stories, as well as a database team. But the reallocation of resources to regional stories and political news has prompted concerns that McClatchy will no longer compete on some critical beats, such as national security, for which the company has gained national distinction. A McClatchy reporting team has long been heralded for producing the most skeptical coverage of the Bush administration's case for war in Iraq. National security reporter Jonathan Landay, who was part of that team, announced last week that he was leaving the company after 16 years. He told HuffPost on Friday that closing the foreign bureaus means ""shutting off an important source of news and analysis at a time when we need to be paying more attention because our mission is to inform and educate."" McClatchy won a Polk Award in 2012 for its coverage of the war in Syria and was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in April of this year for its reporting on the Senate Intelligence Committee's CIA torture report. John Walcott, who served as Washington bureau chief from 2002 to 2010 and oversaw the pre-Iraq coverage, expressed concerns on Friday about the company's direction. “The Knight Ridder and McClatchy bureaus were sadly unique in the value they placed on cultivating the working-level sources closest to the action and the resistance they maintained to the lure of trading independence and critical thinking for access to the political, military and economic establishments,"" Walcott wrote in an email. Shortly after the changes were officially announced on Monday, a former staffer told HuffPost that ""the leaders of McClatchy are assuming their readers are as provincial about their news consumption as they are.""In the memo, first published by Poynter, Gyllenhaal wrote that McClatchy will ""continue to undertake international projects on in-depth stories, working with individual McClatchy newsrooms and with partners around the world."" He pointed out in an interview with HuffPost that McClatchy papers will still be able to publish dispatches from the foreign bureaus of the The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Associated Press, through the company's syndication deals with those publications.Gyllenhaal acknowledged the importance of international news, but stressed that the company needed to reallocate resources going forward. ""We have been working with four bureaus and we’ve been proud of the work we’ve been able to do,"" he said. ""But to own those stories is a stretch. Our folks have done extraordinary work from Syria to Ukraine to China, but you have to ask the question, 'What can we do with the resources we have?'''Gyllenhaal said the bureau will still cover beats like national security and expects to replace Landay. ""Our job is to maintain the DNA, which stretches back for many years, and to do the kind of work we’ve always done -- and to do it in some new places,"" he said. Today, we’re announcing an important shift in the mission of the Washington bureau to focus above all on regional and political coverage, as well as national stories of particular impact in our communities. These changes better align the bureau with McClatchy’s overall news strategy and more directly support our newsrooms with the kind of high quality journalism McClatchy stands for. We’re talking about this in staff meetings at the bureau this morning. We also wanted to explain the thinking to editors and publishers and to our newsrooms.Also on HuffPost: "
7,POLITICS,This Year's Million Man March Transcended The Nation Of Islam’s Involvement,Philip Lewis and Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/million-man-march_us_561be631e4b0082030a3498a,The gathering in D.C. this weekend was not about Louis Farrakhan.,2015-10-12,"Mike Lowe and Cleo Jeffryes both called for justice, an end to police violence and acknowledgement from older generations that younger black Americans are handling these issues differently.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561be8e01400006f003c7fff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- When Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, took the stage at the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March on Saturday, there was an air of curiosity as to how the 82-year-old minister would address a new generation of activists -- a good many of whom had missed out on the original 1995 march by virtue of being too young, or not yet existing at all.Farrakhan is a divisive figure, to say the least. He's been criticized for promoting sexist, homophobic and transphobic views. And he's far from the only black male activist who's been accused of marginalizing women and queer and trans people of color -- and not all of those activists are in their 80s, either. For some, it is impossible to separate the Million Man March from that problem. To others, the march is bigger than that. ""I came to join in this congregation, in this gathering. I believe there's a great spirit. The 20th anniversary is not to be overlooked,"" Christopher Gillespie, a student at Michigan State University, told The Huffington Post. ""The first gathering was something that I couldn't attend because I was just born. But this time, I wanted to be a part of this movement and be able to see where it takes our nation.""The theme for this year’s march was ""Justice Or Else,” and the event was meant as a response to the problems that disproportionately face young black Americans, such as police violence and economic inequality. The Nation of Islam and other activists addressed this through social media: “Fifty years ago we were marching on Selma, and there’s no change. We want justice. We want accountability,” Cleo Jeffryes, a 22-year-old participant in the march, told HuffPost.“This is our generation. This is our movement. This is not our mom’s or our granddaddy’s.”Jeffryes was speaking to a generational divide that's been discussed a lot with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. Some activists -- many of them alumni of the civil rights efforts of the 1950s and '60s -- believe that politically involved black Americans have an obligation to be polite and civil at all times, even in the face of violence. Others disagree, saying that with black Americans getting brutalized and killed every day, often by people who then face no consequences, good manners aren't such a high priority. This is a feeling common among younger activists and people in the Black Lives Matter community. But Farrakhan is infamous for preaching the former point of view.“Sometimes they feel like they know everything, so it’s kind of ... disrespectful in some type of way. But, you know, this is our movement,” Jeffryes said. “We’re getting killed. Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice [was] killed. Seven-year-old Aiyana Jones [was] killed for sleeping ... This is our generation. This is our movement. This is us.” Even to older female activists, the generational shift is clear: Black men aren't the central focus of the march anymore.""When you talk about 'Justice or Else,' it's not just impacting men, it's impacting our entire country,” Zephia Bryant, who attended both the 1995 and 2015 marches, told HuffPost. “And I think a lot of the issues that we're dealing with, whether it be police brutality, whether it be injustice, whether it be racial profiling, those things impact our communities. And if we don't all stand for it, then we're all gonna have to ... be accountable for what's going to happen if we're not standing up for our rights.""Kim Moon, another attendee, shared a story with HuffPost about her 15-year-old grandson in Atlanta, who was walking to the store with a friend when, Moon said, he was assaulted by a police officer.“He was pinned to the ground by the police because a week [before] ... somebody was robbed in the store's parking lot,” Moon said. “And [the cop] just instantly made him get on the ground.” According to Moon, the officer then asked the two teenagers where they were headed and where they'd come from. She said her grandson complied.“After that happened to them, I knew I had to come, because I knew I wanted to be a part of this history,"" Moon said. ""I wanted to, you know, demand this justice that we all so very desperately need.""Bryant said the biggest thing to take from this year’s march -- and the last one -- is the love among black people fighting for a common cause. “It's a spirit, it's a sense of community,” she said. “Those same village values that we had years ago, I felt that. You know, you feel the spirit of it. And it's a wonderful feeling to come here -- when you see the media, who is always negatively portraying our people -- when you come into a space where it's just total positiveness.”Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) presidential campaign on Monday, saying he was doing so as ""a matter of conscience."" Ellison is a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which Sanders helped co-found as a member of the House of Representatives in 1991. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the caucus' other co-chair, endorsed Sanders -- the only senator to have ever joined the group -- last week.""Bernie is really generating a lot of enthusiasm for civic participation,"" Ellison told The Huffington Post, which he pointed out is especially important after the historically low turnout during last year's midterm elections.""We are in need of a civic renaissance in America and Bernie is generating a lot of excitement and energy among young people, old people, all kinds of people, and I think that is really critical,"" he added. ""The manner in which he is moving his campaign forward is healthy for our democracy.""Though Sanders has been steadily gaining on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in national polls, the former secretary of state still has a massive lead in endorsements. Ellison is the second member of Congress to endorse Sanders. More than 100 members of Congress have backed Clinton, according to FiveThirtyEight's endorsement tracker. The site points out that endorsements are a good predictor of who will win a party's presidential nomination. Ellison has previously said he believes Sanders' entrance into the Democratic primary is healthy for the party because the candidate is bringing up issues that may otherwise not have gotten attention and is making the race more competitive in the process. ""I don’t believe that Democrats getting our billionaires to go fight with the Republican billionaires is the solution,"" Ellison said Monday, explaining his endorsement. ""The solution is to have a mass grassroots movement to create the public will and public consensus that we need a fair and balanced economy, so everyone can make it here."" Sanders and Ellison have frequently collaborated on progressive legislation. The two have introduced bills to end government contracts for privately run prisons and jails, eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Ellison told HuffPost that he hoped Sanders addressed both the fears and aspirations of ordinary Americans during the first Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday. ""Millions of Americans are wondering about how they’re going to retire or send their kids or college or pay their bills. I want him to go to the heart of their anxiety, the heart of why they are worried, and offer solutions that will work,"" he said. ""We have seen a dramatic increase in wealth to the very, very rich. We need some restoration, we need some balancing, so ordinary, working people can have a shot in this economy, too."" Also on HuffPost:"

The founding fathers could not have anticipated the widespread availability of “military-grade assault weapons that have turned our streets into battlefields.”“It is no longer enough for those of us involved in civic leadership and pastoral care to comfort the bereaved and bewildered families of victims of gun violence,” he wrote in the column, which was published Friday (Oct. 9).“We must band together to call for gun-control legislation,” he concluded. “We must act in ways that promote the dignity and value of human life. And we must do it now.”In the column, Cupich cited a memorable line from Pope Francis’ speech to Congress during his U.S. visit last month, when the pontiff denounced the profits of the arms trade as “money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood.” It is money made off weapons, he said, “sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society.”The pope’s critique drew a standing ovation from many in the House and Senate, though they apparently saw the blast as directed principally at the international arms trade. Cupich disagreed.“They really can’t stand and applaud one understanding of that line and ignore the domestic implications,” Cupich said in an interview in Rome, where he is one of 270 bishops from around the world meeting for an intense three-week debate about the church’s approach to family life in the modern world.In his op-ed, Cupich cited not only Francis’ remarks, but also the Umpqua Community College massacre in Oregon that took place within a week of the pope’s visit. He also brought up the seemingly nonstop pace of shootings in Chicago itself, a city that has become synonymous with gun violence. In a recent shooting he cited, a toddler was wounded and her mother and grandmother were killed.Yet while those tragedies were part of the equation, Cupich said he had been thinking about the issue since he was installed as Francis’ personal pick for the influential archdiocese last November.Cupich said he wanted to take time to assess the local situation, to talk with pastors and civic leaders and law enforcement officials so that when he did speak out he would “at least provoke further action … rather than just saying something that would get a headline.”The archbishop not only called out gun sellers and “the damage done” by their quest for profits, but he also took direct aim at the Constitution’s Second Amendment guarantee of a “right to bear arms,” a right that has become increasingly sacrosanct for many Americans and the powerful gun lobby.“Let’s be honest,” Cupich wrote. “The Second Amendment was passed in an era when organized police forces were few and citizen militias were useful in maintaining the peace. Its original authors could not have anticipated a time when the weapons we have a right to bear now include military-grade assault weapons that have turned our streets into battlefields.“The Second Amendment’s original intent has been perverted by those who, as Pope Francis recently commented, have profited mightily. Surely there is a middle ground between the original intent of the amendment and the carnage we see today.” With his column, Cupich — whose is seen as mirroring Francis’ pastoral approach to ministry — becomes the most prominent U.S. Catholic churchman to call for greater gun control, and in the most forceful and direct terms.The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which comprises the nation’s nearly 450 bishops, has not made fighting gun violence a priority, and officials representing the hierarchy have generally used more measured language on the issue.In the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting massacre, for example, the USCCB called for “reasonable restrictions” that would not infringe on Second Amendment rights.In an interview on Sunday, Cupich said he hoped his fellow bishops would now consider giving gun control — and the environment, also a priority for Francis — much greater emphasis when they meet next month in Baltimore to revamp their guide for Catholic voters ahead of next year’s election.Currently, both gun violence and the environment are tacked on at the end of the bishops’ voter guide, called “Faithful Citizenship,” while those issues are clearly at the top of the pontiff’s agenda.Today, however, gun control “is a point that needs to be raised” by the American hierarchy, Cupich told Religion News Service, “with the impetus not just what I said, but what the pope said.” Also On HuffPost:"

Bill Flores (R-Texas) asked House Republicans on Monday whether they would support him if he runs for speaker.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561bde8912000026007e4e01.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Rep. Bill Flores is preparing a run for House speaker, according to an email circulated by the Texas Republican and obtained by The Huffington Post.The email was sent to the Republican Study Committee, which Flores’ chairs. It tests the waters for a potential run, asking Flores' colleagues if they would support him for speaker or be willing to whip votes in support of a potential bid. Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) announced his resignation from the position last month.The RSC email also includes a broader note that Flores sent to the entire Republican conference. In his wider message, Flores explained why he'll likely run for the post: “Many of you have asked me to consider serving as Speaker of the House,” Flores wrote. “I am humbled to have my name mentioned as a potential candidate for this critical position, and I am strongly considering the pursuit of the Speakership in response to the requests that several of you have made to me to do so.”The Texas Tribune first reported Flores’ plan, citing two sources who were in the room when Flores announced his intention to oil and gas executives on Monday.If he does run, Flores would be seeking a job that very few within the embattled Republican conference want. House Republicans were thrown into chaos again last week when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) announced that he was pulling out of the race for speaker just hours before the conference was set to vote on the position.McCarthy was the clear favorite to win the speakership, but conservatives had already vowed to back one of their own, raising questions as to whether he would have the needed 218 supporters during the Oct. 29 floor vote. The vote has now been postponed.In his message to Republicans, Flores touted his 30 years of business experience in the energy industry and said he believes a “participative” process empowering all conference members is the best strategy. A key point of contention among the conservative wing of the caucus, and even some moderates, is that newer members who have not worked their way up to higher ranks have little say in what happens on the floor and opportunity to put forward amendments.Flores also took a shot at Senate Republicans, who have become a target of House Republicans for not changing procedural rules to break filibusters on controversial bills. Flores said the Senate's reliance on its ""19th century processes"" has meant all responsibility falls to the House for getting legislation passed, subsequently causing ""internal divisions.""In the letter, Flores also promised to withdraw from the race if Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) decides to run for the post, adding that he’d “give him my full support in this effort.”Immediately following McCarthy's decision to exit the race, many House Republicans began pushing Ryan, who they believe could be a consensus candidate, to run for the speakership.Ryan has repeatedly said he does not want the job and does not plan on running. The only way he would consider it, it seems, is if he in fact is assured by the entire conference that his running would unite the party and the infighting would stop. Flores's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) are also running for the speaker post.Also on HuffPost:"

The emergency rules prohibited certain camping gear, including tents, sleeping bags and stoves, and restricted being within a mile of Mauna Kea Access Road from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., unless in a moving vehicle.The protesters' presence, according to the judge's ruling, ""is not a reason supporting a finding of imminent peril.""Construction of the $1.4 billion Thirty Meter Telescope atop Mauna Kea, on Hawaii's Big Island, has been on hold since April as a result of the ongoing and coordinated protests. The mountain is considered sacred in Native Hawaiian culture. Dozens of protesters have been arrested so far, and for months, a core group maintained a constant, 24-hour presence outside the Mauna Kea Visitor Information Station.The emergency rules were drafted in the wake of a large June protest in which hundreds of activists used their bodies and large boulders to prevent construction crews from reaching the summit. David Kauila Kopper, the lawyer with the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation who filed the lawsuit against the emergency rule on behalf of Big Island resident E. Kalani Flores, praised Friday's decision.""The State adopted an illegal rule to prevent opposition to the [Thirty Meter Telescope] at the expense of sincere cultural practices and public expression,"" he said in a statement.“It’s good to have some justice, some sense of justice from the state,” telescope opponent Lakea Trask said of Friday's ruling in an interview with the Tribune-Herald.“We felt like we couldn’t be Hawaiians in our most sacred area,"" Trask added.In a joint statement Friday, Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin and state Board of Land and Natural Resources Chairwoman Suzanne Case acknowledged the court's decision and said the state will abide by it. ""We remind people traveling to Mauna Kea that even in light of today's ruling, existing laws and rules remain,"" they said. ""It is always illegal to block the road. This includes standing in the road or placing obstructions in the road. These laws will continue to be enforced.""Last month, TMT International Observatory announced that, despite protests, it still expects the Thirty Meter Telescope to be ready in 2024.

It opens Oct. 14 is slated to run through Nov. 14.According to a press release, the ""the exhibit historicizes the sexological and cultural imaginary of transgender through a curatorial exploration of the Kinsey Archives and the burgeoning movements for transgender expression from the turn of the 20 century.""The list of artists associated with ""Bring Your Own Body"" is extensive and includes Justin Vivian Bond, Flawless Sabrina, Juliana Huxtable, Chris Vargas and Zackary Drucker, among others.The Huffington Post chatted with Vaccaro and Gregory this week about their vision for ""Bring Your Own Body"" and the narrative being constructed through their curatorial work.The Huffington Post: What was the overarching concept for ""Bring Your Own Body""?Jeanne Vaccaro: The exhibit explores the way transgender identity is formed between an archive and an aesthetic. In other words, between an official history or record and the performative and artistic; between what is decreed by doctors, psychiatrists, and legislators, and what is experienced and lived. The space between is the space of power relations in tension and in movement. Stamatina Gregory: Mounting this exhibition at the School of Art at the Cooper Union is important because we want to expand the art historical canon and foreground themes of pedagogy and politics. For a small art school we have a group of committed queer and trans students inviting artists and creating programs. For example, inviting Dark Matter to campus. Juliana Huxtable, who is giving a reading for the exhibition, is also doing studio visits with students. Our students in the School of Art have a critical interest in the intersections of art-making and social justice, and they take tremendous initiative in bringing artists and creating dialogues here. Our hope is that this project and our programming add to the conversations that are already happening at Cooper.Vaccaro: We are not interested in offering definitions as a whole, and in fact to do so when it comes to any identity is dangerous. We wanted to present a modern history of transgender using archival collections, but it isn’t possible to exhibit that kind of material without feeling the violent weight of sexological and diagnostic histories and their continued reverberations in foreclosing transgender subjectivity. In order to exhibit that material we had to do so in dialogue with contemporary art and world making efforts by transgender and genderqueer artists.What do you feel like this exhibit contributes to the increasingly mainstream conversation about gender identity? Vaccaro: It certainly complicates the mainstream narrative and illustrates not just the multiplicity of transgender identities but the many forms of expression those identities take. Popular media representation often contributes to a pathological and medicalized view of trans experience. With art and performance we can show another side of the story -- including the rage of confronting misrepresentation in the media.Gregory: The historical materials we are exhibiting from the archives of the Kinsey Institute and the University of Victoria Transgender Archives demonstrate the origins of transgender in American midcentury sexology, which is something the mainstream public has very little awareness of. Photography, correspondence, drawings, ephemera, and printed matter culled from the archives highlight the intersection of historical taxonomy and lived experience. Transgender is neither new nor finished, despite recent and unprecedented visibility in popular media. In fact, a return to the archive offers a critical historical perspective. Police mug shots of transgender women of color imprisoned in the 1960s for sex work and female impersonation highlight the ethical and long overdue need for an intersectional and abolitionist transgender movement. Many parallels can be drawn between the sensational media coverage of Caitlyn Jenner and the New York Daily News headline of Dec. 1, 1952 proclaiming “Ex-GI Becomes Blonde Beauty: Operations Transform Bronx Youth.” Christine Jorgensen in fact intersected with Alfred Kinsey himself, visiting the Institute in 1953 so he could take her sex history.How did you pick these artists?Vaccaro: Selecting artists was a near impossible task, especially as the list of talented and visionary transgender artists is an expansive one. Ultimately we made selections based on several factors, one key one being the artist’s relation to an archive. In many cases this was explicit, as in the case of Chris Vargas, who we commissioned to make a new work using materials from a research visit to the Kinsey archives. Under the rubric of his “imaginary” Museum of Transgender Hirstory and Art, he has created a takeaway collage and digital projection exploring the news media headlines about gender transformation from the 1940s, '50s, '60s and on, based on the scrapbooks of Louise Lawrence. This new work performatively harnesses and plays with an inherited set of representations and found objects. Of his experience in the archives Vargas said, “I was struck by how the sensational approach to gender identity has not shifted significantly over the past 60 years. I was excited to work with the scrapbooks of self-identified transsexual Louise Lawrence who had a generous relationship and intellectual exchange with Alfred Kinsey about the evolving notions of gender in the mid-century.”Gregory: We also felt it was necessary to draw attention to an artistic legacy and to an art historical through line from artists such as Genesis Breyer P Orridge and Vaginal Davis to, for example, downtown performer, artist and activist Chloe Dzubilo (1960-2011). Flawless Sabrina and Zackary Drucker have strong ties to one another. The work of young artists Mark Aguhar (1987-2012) and Effy Beth (1989-2014), both tragically no longer with us, were galvanizing for so many queer and trans people on digital platforms like Tumblr in the U.S. and South America, and we were privileged to have the blessing of their families to exhibit their work and continue to share it with a wider audience.What do you want viewers to take away from ""Bring Your Own Body""?Vaccaro: While the exhibition gathers work under an expanded umbrella of transgender, it does so without identitarian claims. In that way, and in many others, B.Y.O.B. seeks to pose more questions than it does answers. That can be said of most “good art,” and it can certainly be said of identity.

Courtesy of the artist's estate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561be8bf1200002e007e4e26.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new exhibit is on display at The Cooper Union in New York City that brings together the work of transgender artists and the famed Kinsey Archives.Called ""Bring Your Own Body: Transgender Between Archives & Aesthetics,"" the event is curated by Jeanne Vaccaro, a postdoctoral fellow in gender studies at Indiana University and a scholar at the Kinsey Institute, and Stamatina Gregory, associate dean of the School of Art at The Cooper Union. It opens Oct. 14 is slated to run through Nov. 14.According to a press release, the ""the exhibit historicizes the sexological and cultural imaginary of transgender through a curatorial exploration of the Kinsey Archives and the burgeoning movements for transgender expression from the turn of the 20 century.""The list of artists associated with ""Bring Your Own Body"" is extensive and includes Justin Vivian Bond, Flawless Sabrina, Juliana Huxtable, Chris Vargas and Zackary Drucker, among others.The Huffington Post chatted with Vaccaro and Gregory this week about their vision for ""Bring Your Own Body"" and the narrative being constructed through their curatorial work.The Huffington Post: What was the overarching concept for ""Bring Your Own Body""?Jeanne Vaccaro: The exhibit explores the way transgender identity is formed between an archive and an aesthetic. In other words, between an official history or record and the performative and artistic; between what is decreed by doctors, psychiatrists, and legislators, and what is experienced and lived. The space between is the space of power relations in tension and in movement. Stamatina Gregory: Mounting this exhibition at the School of Art at the Cooper Union is important because we want to expand the art historical canon and foreground themes of pedagogy and politics. For a small art school we have a group of committed queer and trans students inviting artists and creating programs. For example, inviting Dark Matter to campus. Juliana Huxtable, who is giving a reading for the exhibition, is also doing studio visits with students. Our students in the School of Art have a critical interest in the intersections of art-making and social justice, and they take tremendous initiative in bringing artists and creating dialogues here. Our hope is that this project and our programming add to the conversations that are already happening at Cooper.Vaccaro: We are not interested in offering definitions as a whole, and in fact to do so when it comes to any identity is dangerous. We wanted to present a modern history of transgender using archival collections, but it isn’t possible to exhibit that kind of material without feeling the violent weight of sexological and diagnostic histories and their continued reverberations in foreclosing transgender subjectivity. In order to exhibit that material we had to do so in dialogue with contemporary art and world making efforts by transgender and genderqueer artists.What do you feel like this exhibit contributes to the increasingly mainstream conversation about gender identity? Vaccaro: It certainly complicates the mainstream narrative and illustrates not just the multiplicity of transgender identities but the many forms of expression those identities take. Popular media representation often contributes to a pathological and medicalized view of trans experience. With art and performance we can show another side of the story -- including the rage of confronting misrepresentation in the media.Gregory: The historical materials we are exhibiting from the archives of the Kinsey Institute and the University of Victoria Transgender Archives demonstrate the origins of transgender in American midcentury sexology, which is something the mainstream public has very little awareness of. Photography, correspondence, drawings, ephemera, and printed matter culled from the archives highlight the intersection of historical taxonomy and lived experience. Transgender is neither new nor finished, despite recent and unprecedented visibility in popular media. In fact, a return to the archive offers a critical historical perspective. Police mug shots of transgender women of color imprisoned in the 1960s for sex work and female impersonation highlight the ethical and long overdue need for an intersectional and abolitionist transgender movement. Many parallels can be drawn between the sensational media coverage of Caitlyn Jenner and the New York Daily News headline of Dec. 1, 1952 proclaiming “Ex-GI Becomes Blonde Beauty: Operations Transform Bronx Youth.” Christine Jorgensen in fact intersected with Alfred Kinsey himself, visiting the Institute in 1953 so he could take her sex history.How did you pick these artists?Vaccaro: Selecting artists was a near impossible task, especially as the list of talented and visionary transgender artists is an expansive one. Ultimately we made selections based on several factors, one key one being the artist’s relation to an archive. In many cases this was explicit, as in the case of Chris Vargas, who we commissioned to make a new work using materials from a research visit to the Kinsey archives. Under the rubric of his “imaginary” Museum of Transgender Hirstory and Art, he has created a takeaway collage and digital projection exploring the news media headlines about gender transformation from the 1940s, '50s, '60s and on, based on the scrapbooks of Louise Lawrence. This new work performatively harnesses and plays with an inherited set of representations and found objects. Of his experience in the archives Vargas said, “I was struck by how the sensational approach to gender identity has not shifted significantly over the past 60 years. I was excited to work with the scrapbooks of self-identified transsexual Louise Lawrence who had a generous relationship and intellectual exchange with Alfred Kinsey about the evolving notions of gender in the mid-century.”Gregory: We also felt it was necessary to draw attention to an artistic legacy and to an art historical through line from artists such as Genesis Breyer P Orridge and Vaginal Davis to, for example, downtown performer, artist and activist Chloe Dzubilo (1960-2011). Flawless Sabrina and Zackary Drucker have strong ties to one another. The work of young artists Mark Aguhar (1987-2012) and Effy Beth (1989-2014), both tragically no longer with us, were galvanizing for so many queer and trans people on digital platforms like Tumblr in the U.S. and South America, and we were privileged to have the blessing of their families to exhibit their work and continue to share it with a wider audience.What do you want viewers to take away from ""Bring Your Own Body""?Vaccaro: While the exhibition gathers work under an expanded umbrella of transgender, it does so without identitarian claims. In that way, and in many others, B.Y.O.B. seeks to pose more questions than it does answers. That can be said of most “good art,” and it can certainly be said of identity. Of course, we hope people learn from the work, but most importantly -- and in the face of the crisis of violence facing trans people -- we want to create a space to celebrate the visionary and imaginative spirit of transgender liberation.""Bring Your Own Body"" is on display at The Cooper Union from Oct. 14 through Nov. 14.

Blanchett and Mara have been at the forefront of next year's Oscar talk since the movie premiered at Cannes in May. But a third performance has received quieter kudos: Kyle Chandler in the role of Blanchett's husband.Chandler's feat is full of resolve, his character struggling to reconcile the love he still feels for his wife while recognizing that she does not share the same desire. His screen time is a fraction of Blanchett's and Mara's, but it turns out Coach Taylor has just the brooding masculinity and underlying sweetness to capture the sexual stifle of '50s suburbia -- and Todd Haynes knew that from the start.The director, whose previous movies include ""I'm Not There"" and ""Far From Heaven,"" participated in an hourlong Q&A on Saturday as part of the New York Film Festival's Directors Dialogue series. There, he dissected his ""Carol"" influences -- namely the 1945 British drama ""Brief Encounter"" -- and explained his casting choices.Blanchett had signed on before Haynes was involved, when ""Brooklyn"" director John Crowley was attached to the project. When Mia Wasikowska dropped out due to scheduling conflicts, Haynes selected Mara based on the eclectic body of work she's established in less than a decade, which includes ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and ""Her."" But for Chandler, the director knew he needed one thing in particular: ""You have to cast, without sounding sexist, a real man opposite Cate Blanchett.""""You need a guy who's grown up, and a lot of actors don't seem grown up, no matter how old they get,"" he said. ""They just seem like juveniles with gray hair or something, and he seems like a grown-up. He can hold his own with her. That's not always easy.""Haynes, who worked with Blanchett on her Oscar-nominated turn as Bob Dylan in ""I'm Not There,"" said he'd seen enough of ""Friday Night Lights"" to be ""so impressed"" with Chandler.""That guy is so gifted, and he's made for the '50s, too,"" he said.
