0,TRAVEL,Spring Break Travel With A Purpose,"Crawford Hill, Contributor
Educator, CEO of Chill Expeditions",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/spring-break-travel-with_us_5b9cd1cde4b03a1dcc821b6f,Spring break provides an incredible opportunity to do some volunteer work and have a vacation too.,2013-03-01,2013-02-12-DSC06277_pvschoolprojectgrupoVersion2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-02-12-DSC06277_pvschoolprojectgrupoVersion2.jpg,"Spring break provides an incredible opportunity to do some volunteer work and have a vacation too. A key is ensuring that any community service projects you are interested in are actually sustainable, ongoing efforts into which the local community is fully invested. Otherwise, the effort is a one-off, short-term feel-good experience for the traveler with minimal enduring positive local impact and possibly even negative local net effect.Some have called the fusion of service and a vacation voluntourism, but I prefer the term eco-immersion. Eco-immersion embeds the service component and other elements of your experience in a thoughtful, 360-degree context which enhances the entire journey so that you didn't just do a service project or see some cool stuff in a foreign land, but rather were given pause about what is most important to you -- even back home! This approach re-connects you with yourself and those close to you by giving to others in need while learning in a hands-on way about many other aspects of their life and the world they live in. The payback is dramatic.Eco-immersion as a family experience is a profound opportunity for learning, fun and precious, quality time spent together, unplugged, sharing and instilling important values. Such an experience together is, as they say, priceless. Of course as a student group, you would be hard-pressed to maximize your spring break in a more meaningful yet fun and rewarding way!Giving Back One of the strongest collaborators I have personally had the pleasure of working with -- a man committed to running such sustainable, locally invested projects -- is Arturo Segura. He is a renowned organic coffee wizard, humanitarian and innovator, who works with travelers to install clean burning eco-stoves in indigenous villages across Costa Rica. These efforts directly reduce respiratory illness, a major health issue facing wood-burning indigenous populations worldwide. Furthermore, these simple but efficient devices dramatically reduce the amount of wood consumed, saving resources and lowering carbon dioxide production.Travelers get to work with and know Arturo, whose own story is phenomenal. (He left his Dad's traditional coffee farm go completely wild 25 years ago to the astonishment of his neighbors, who thought he had gone ""loco."" Now his shade grown, forest nurtured coffee is internationally recognized!) Visitors also gain a deep understanding of local villagers. Meanwhile, all this takes place in locations of sublime natural beauty and biodiversity and there are plenty of local kids who love sharing their amazing lifestyle and environment with the curious! Such experiences have profound effects on the way travelers view themselves and others as they develop a more nuanced and deeper global perspective. There are a multitude of ways travelers can engage in community projects while on vacation. Many people enjoy working with rural schools on projects, including classroom construction, mural installation and educational organic garden planting. The greatest part about these experiences is the enduring effect it has on the traveler, no matter the age! To give you an example, we work with an incredible school in Weston, Mass. called Meadowbrook that sends their eighth graders on such an eco-immersion community service trip to Costa Rica. This culminating experience plays an integral role in the curriculum throughout the year.Recently, two 13-year-old students were so moved by their experience -- tutoring the local population and assisting at an orphanage in Limon -- that they returned home with a mission to start a fundraising campaign and work with their teachers to develop a tutoring program. Through hard work and sheer perseverance these young leaders were able to raise more than $3,500 for the cause while organizing a return trip to Costa Rica!When the students touched down in Costa Rica, their goals were two-fold: help educate local students in mathematics and donate the supplies they collected to the orphanage. This experience included hands-on, step-by-step instruction in using a manipulative program developed at Harvard that uses scale-sized blocks called Digiblocks to allow students to see and feel what their math algorithms actually represent.For the next several days, the same teachers and students partnered with local educators in classrooms to co-teach and support this initiative. The trip culminated in the students delivering the donations to the orphanage, which totaled 10 large duffle bags and included clothes, shoes, toys and books. There were actually more boxes that could not be delivered in person due to bag limitations on the plane, so they continued to ship donations from back home! These kids were only eighth graders, but through voluntourism, or better yet, eco-immersion, their eyes were opened to a world of new possibilities! These kinds of life-changing experiences are what fuel my passion for experiential travel.Each of these opportunities is in a special place and the folks you will meet are extremely engaging. This is the essence of eco-immersion. Once you connect with committed people, doing good work sustainably in a magical part of the planet, it is actually easy to achieve the best balance of service, adventure, education and unwinding that does the trick for you. Such volunteer experiences are truly lasting in effect and somehow manage to energize, enlighten and relax those willing to strive for something beyond a vacation!"

(AP Photo/LM Otero)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc20924000051005352ef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Why is using airline vouchers so hard?  Q: On our return trip from Chicago my wife and I gave up our seats because the flight was oversold and we each received a $400 voucher for future travel. Can these vouchers be redeemed only at the United desk at an airport or can we do it online or on the phone? Do all major airlines have the same policies?  A: Not surprisingly perhaps, some airlines don't make it easy to use vouchers. United and American, for example, don't allow you to enter the voucher number on their websites and book travel that way. You either have to do it at an airport ticket counter (or city ticket office, but those are far and few between; AA only has three left). You can also buy your ticket on the phone and tell the agent that you have a voucher; you'll be asked to mail the voucher and the value of the voucher will be deducted from your fare once it's received. I recommend that you make a copy of the voucher. Delta, in contrast, allows you to apply the voucher's value online.  Whatever happened to ""free"" frequent flier tickets?  Q: I have saved lots of air miles on British Airways and American over the last 10 years by using my credit card. When I try to use them to fly to Europe or Africa, I noticed that BA charges $800 in taxes and fuel on a flight to Nairobi. Most of that is a fuel surcharge. American was only going to charge around $20 on a similar flight. I can buy a ticket for almost $1200 to Nairobi. So basically, my 100,000 air miles are worth $400. Also on British Airways, even when you try to find something almost eight months in advance, there is nothing available. I guess what I'm asking, is there anyone to complain to about these unfair fees or is it just shut up and save another airlines' air miles for years and then have them screw you too after you've saved 10 years to take your family somewhere exotic.   A: I never use my BA Avios points on economy class tickets, because it is indeed not worth it. You'll pay the same taxes and fuel charge on a business class ticket which would cost thousands more than an economy ticket. That's where the value is. And you're right, American, for whatever reason, does not stick you with the fuel surcharge. You can sometimes spend your BA miles on its OneWorld partner American and avoid the fuel charge, so that's one possibility. But if you're flying through London, you'll still end up paying the British government's air passenger duty, which keeps going up. It's usually best to attempt to use BA miles on a OneWorld partner on the phone rather than online, but you might also want to consult this article."

Further, she said, the pervasive wage gap and maternal job prejudice exacerbate the disparity in equality and the ability for both women and men to balance work and life priorities.But there's another missing component that could revolutionize women's ability to achieve economic parity: access to high-quality, affordable and flexible child care. As Coontz pointed out, when equality isn't logistically possible, women are much more likely to assume primary parenting responsibilities -- quite often at the expense of their careers.Why do women who otherwise desire a career drop out of the workforce? Coontz argues that it's often a ""reasonable response to the fact that our political and economic institutions lag way behind our personal ideas."" Indeed, that's true. But, for many women, insurmountable child care costs force their decision. Imagine the accomplished teacher whose salary doesn't cover child care costs for her two young children. As it turns out, average child care fees exceed average housing costs among families with two children. In most states, the average annual cost for an infant in center-based care exceeds public college tuition. It's easy to see that for some women, particularly those segregated in lower-paying jobs, it's financially more beneficial (even if not personally preferable) to stay at home.Yet, these choices -- however influenced by family or employer-induced barriers -- apply only to two-parent homes. Consider the challenges of families headed by a single mother. Many of these women struggle to afford the child care they need to continue earning their family's only paycheck. Shift-workers, like restaurant servers, face additional obstacles in finding child care that is flexible enough to meet their unpredictable schedules. The U.S. lags far behind other industrialized nations in establishing a functional child care system. That's why President Obama's recent proposal to provide universal access to preschool is encouraging. While it doesn't completely address the needs of the 11 million children younger than 5 utilizing child care each week, it's a step in the right direction for women and families.Not only does preschool improve the educational trajectory of young children, but universal access to preschool would eliminate one barrier to women's equality in the workforce -- at least, beyond a child's first three years of life. The work-life policies that Coontz seeks must be accompanied by increased public investment in child care and early education, particularly for the most marginalized women. Coontz cited Pew Research Center statistics showing that in 2011, two-thirds of younger women said that in addition to having a family, being successful in a high-paying career or profession was ""very important"" or ""one of the most important things"" in their lives. Fifty years after The Feminine Mystique, we ought to make our dreams our priority."

According to Kruger, men and women seemed to generally agree on which items would point to infidelity. He did note, however, that ""forming a deep emotional bond"" stood out as one action that women rated considerably higher on the scale than men. ""We think that could relate to the notion that if this guy is forming a deep emotional connection with another woman, that's a danger to their own relationship so he might desert [his partner] or possibly abandon her in the future,"" Kruger said.

That's the number one question I get these days now that I have returned to work part-time as a lawyer. I understand why people are asking me that. After all, just weeks ago, I spent the majority of my time with my two children. Now, I spend two full days in an office downtown and a half-day working from home.While it seems like a perfectly logical question to ask someone in my position, I hate it. I mean, I really hate it when someone asks me that. Maybe it's the emphasis on ""so hard."" It makes me feel like I have to say yes and affirm that the hardest thing about resuming part-time work is being away from my children. Something about the leading nature of the question makes me clam up and offer a trite answer.""Yes, it's so hard to be away from the kids but I am getting used to it.""But then I feel shame, because it actually hasn't been so hard being away from my children. Frankly, I have been happy to have some space from them and the role I play at home. It's been refreshing to use my brain to think through legal issues and take a break from playing chauffeur, referee, cook and butler.But there's something about the question triggers in me a doubt about myself as a ""good"" mother because my chief complaint about my job is not about missing my children while I am gone. Hearing that question makes me wonder if I should miss my kids more than I do.   Should this feel harder? Would it feel harder if I was a more devoted mother?And it's plenty hard to start a new job, regardless of whether you leave behind two children to do it. For me, it's been stressful to keep up with the workload, learn my new boss' preferences and get back up to speed after two years off -- all while still learning where the bathroom is.  The hardest part of my new job isn't being away from my kids. It's learning how to work again. That part is so hard. And the truth is that I do miss my kids on those long office days, but I don't let myself ""go there"" for very long. I've committed to the job and need to focus on my work there. I know that my kids are in safe, loving hands while I am at work, and this is our new life. So if you want to ask me about this new transition in my life, feel free to ask me about it. Ask me if I am finding the work interesting. Ask me if it's fulfilling to be back in the legal world. Ask me if I've found the quickest route to the bathroom.

Whether you or your spouse wishes to retain the marital residence after the divorce, it is important that an accurate value is obtained for purposes of property division.Get A Home AppraisalThe most reliable valuation method for real estate would be to obtain an appraisal from a licensed appraiser. Depending on your real estate market, appraisals can cost a few hundred or several hundred dollars. While this can be financially burdensome when your income is already strapped due to the costs of the divorce process, an appraisal can save you thousands of dollars if the value you are using for the real estate is inaccurate. For example, if you are requesting to keep the marital residence, and you are attributing value to the property based on a 2009 assessor's value at $150,000, but a recent appraisal values the property at $140,000, you will owe your spouse $5,000 less in equity for the residence. Thus, the cost of an appraisal is often a worthwhile investment. Conversely, if your spouse is requesting to keep the residence, and you have inadvertently valued the property too low, you could be losing out on equity in the home to which you are entitled. If you and your spouse are not in agreement on the value of the residence, an appraiser is a reliable witness whom you can call to testify at a final hearing.Comparative Market AnalysisAnother method of valuation can be a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA). Realtors will often be willing to do a CMA for a homeowner at little or no cost, which can provide a possible fair market value for your residence. A CMA looks to the other homes for sale or recently sold in your area and compares those homes and their sale prices with your home's value. While this is a more cost-effective option than an appraisal, it can be less accurate, as it may not take into account the specific condition of your residence. However, if you are looking for a quick and cost-effective value method for your residence, this can be an option to utilize.Do Your Own ResearchSome parties will do their own research with online websites to determine a value, like Zillow.com. Unless you and your soon-to-be-ex-spouse are willing to agree to this method of valuation, it is usually recommended that a more accurate and reliable source of valuation be implemented. Presenting documents from a website is not viewed to be as accurate by the court as an appraisal or CMA.As with any expert witness, it is best to retain the services of a neutral third party, i.e., if your sister is an appraiser, you probably should not utilize her appraisal services for your dissolution case. Using a potentially biased person to provide the value for your property can give the other side an easy way to pull apart your proposed value of your real estate holding.Of course, the other option would be to sell the marital residence and agree to split the proceeds from the sale accordingly. But if either party wishes to keep the marital residence, then it is important that a fair and accurate value for that property is obtained using one of the methods described above."

Pairing cheese with it and making sauces with it are too easy. Raise your game, guys: Let's cook with hops!Challenged by celebrity Chef David Burke, who offered an intriguing array of hop-infused dishes at his restaurants (David Burke Prime, Burke in the Box, et al.) last month, I acquired a bag of these gossamer jade-green flowers and started devising recipes. First up was agave-sweetened Meyer Lemon Hopinade:Since ancient days, wine has been made from grapes, a prolific plant which humankind also enjoys in many other ways. Since ancient days, beer has been made from hops, a prolific plant which humankind couldn't recognize if hops suddenly poured out of the sky. Why?As beer itself suggests, hops are bitter blossoms indeed. Unaccompanied and unbuffered, hops are eye-poppingly, palate-slammingly bitter. You can't just pop these babies into your mouth and munch away as you can with grapes. ""Cooking with hops puts a hop in your step and your meal,"" laughed Burke, who created his hops recipes -- see his formula for hoppy ice-cream donut sliders, below -- in collaboration with Samuel Adams, whose citrusy seasonal Alpine Spring  craft beer is made with Tettnang Tettnanger hops, a variety cultivated on century-old vines in the Alpine foothills. ""Tettnang Tettnanger hops will give food an earthy flavor -- a taste that's hard to get from other ingredients. These hops also give a nice piney aroma to foods; they work well with pastas and rice and can also be a perfect finish on chicken, similar to cracked pepper,"" Burke said.The trick is to use hops lightly, as a suggestion rather than a statement. They're just so strong. Texturally they're deceptively dainty, like jasmine petals. Flavorwise, they're bitter the way Chinese bitter melon is bitter. Bitterer than bitter lemons. I added a big handful to a quinoa dish:... which tasted very bracing, the gentle grassy graininess of quinoa and the starchiness of corn confronting that bold raging scream of the hops. An exciting experience, if arguably medicinal-tasting.Samuel Adams Brewing Manager Jennifer Glanville offered me a few further thoughts on hop-eating:When used as an ingredient, the ""spice of beer,"" as Glanville calls hops, ""can add dimension to a recipe, just like they do in beer, and can bring an unexpected yet welcome flavor to dishes. ... Hops leave a lingering citrus note on the palate and a clean, dry finish that cleanses the palate. When cooking with Tettnang Tettnanger hops, the fresh, piny, citrus character is a bit more pure and intense since the other flavors -- yeast, malt, et cetera -- found in beer aren't present.""As with brewing beer, the wonders are often in the difficulties. Cooking with hops is still a fresh idea and there aren't a lot of precedents, therefore much like home brewing, the difficulty and wonder is in experimenting with different hop varieties"" -- available online and at homebrew shops -- ""and hop recipes and trying them on your own. Cooking with beer isn't new; for example, people have been using brewers' grain in breads and pizza dough for years. But cooking with hops is uncharted territory.""True! But as beer gets trendier, bitterness might soon be right up there with salty and sweet.Chef Burke adds: ""Hops can certainly work wonders on a meal, adding lots of robust flavors, aromas and textures. If you're still a bit timid, test run them as a condiment -- a garnish for mashed potatoes, or sprinkled on soup. A hop-diment!""And if you want to bring some of your newfound hop-hop-hoppiness with you everywhere you go, consider B-Hoppy, hard candies made with Cascade hops. Maker Bob Bero is an Ohio homebrewer who told me:""After a failed attempt at making hop-scented soap with some extract that I had obtained from some folks up in Yakima [Washington], I didn't want to waste what was left in the container and it was sitting on the kitchen counter during my Christmas present making period. While making hard candy for the family, I kept looking at the container between batches and finally it became candy."" Sweet!

He worked with corporate R&D to develop the final product, which rolled out nationally in July 2009 after what the company said were two years of testing.The Angus Third Pounders were the first McDonald's items ever to use these five ingredients: red-onion rings, full slices of bacon, sautéed mushrooms, Natural Swiss cheese and a bakery-style sesame seed roll.

Last October, McDonald's used the Angus burger patty for its CBO (Cheddar Bacon Onion) LTO.Angus burgers have become important parts of the McDonald's menu in a number of countries. Grand Angus and Mighty Angus burgers were added in Australia in August 2009 they were added in Canada in April 2011.

Everett Koop speaks in Philadelphia. Koop, who raised the profile of the surgeon general by riveting America's attention on the then-emerging disease known as AIDS and by railing against smoking, died Monday, Feb. 25, 2013, in Hanover, N.H. He was 96. (AP Photo/Robert J. Gurecki, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce0773c0000320009ef00.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"C. Everett ""Chic"" Koop became U. S. Surgeon General under President Reagan. He was a world renowned pediatric surgeon who had a tumultuous Senate confirmation process due to partisanship. Chic took office in January 1982, a time of ""tobacco wars"" and a new and evolving terrifying disease that we ultimately came to know as AIDS. Chic forever changed and elevated the standard of practice for all surgeons general who followed him.A man of enormous physical presence and stature, he became a public figure at the juxtaposition of a nation yearning for a credible, visible and competent health leader with that of a national media consumed by an insatiable appetite for content.As a young surgeon in training at the University of California San Francisco General Hospital in the early '80s, my colleagues and I were inundated with an epidemic of young men with fevers, rashes, swollen lymph nodes and eventually death. It was a terrifying time for us, and the world for we did not know the cause of or how to treat this devastating disease.This was also at a time that some national elected officials were telling the public that this was God's way of punishing homosexuals in spite of the fact that scientists in 1983 discovered that this was a communicable infectious disease, HIV/AIDS.Although challenged by political pressure and threats to have him fired for his adherence to science, Chic persisted in his role as surgeon general to inform the public that this was a preventable infectious disease. At a presentation at San Francisco General Hospital he told us, ""I am the surgeon general of the heterosexuals and homosexuals, of the young and the old, of the moral and immoral, the married and unmarried. I don't have the luxury to decide what side I want to be on."" In doing so, Chic managed to change the national and global dialogue from one being tainted by nonscientific political and ideological bias, to a scientific approach which ultimately changed the course of this global disease, resulting in slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS and saving lives.Historically, the position of surgeon general has been an embattled one for well over a century. In 2007, Surgeons General Carmona, Satcher and Koop testified to Congress about the attempts at politicizing science and the Office of the Surgeon General. The testimony of 3 surgeons general was unprecedented and remarkably similar, providing invaluable information to Congress, which Congress failed to act on.Chic particularly enjoyed the distinction that he and I were the only two surgeons in history to be surgeon general. I came to personally know Chic as a new surgeon general in 2002 when he befriended and mentored me. For he understood that there was no formal training program for surgeons general and that each of us enters the ""combat zone"" naïve and wanting to stamp out disease, famine, pestilence and to correct social injustice and health inequity. He realized that sometimes the harshest plague we faced was not emerging infections or terrorism but rather the plague of politics.He understood that ""once a surgeon general, always a surgeon general"" and that part of his job in perpetuity was to mentor others who followed in his footsteps so they could serve optimally in a tenure that moves at warp speed surrounded by many with competing political interests. One of the first things Chic told me as I entered the Office of the Surgeon General was to be aware of all the ""staffers"" who will repeatedly come to you and begin their requests with ""the White House wants...."" He said that these are mostly people with their own political agendas who need you to give credibility to their particular endeavor. Chic said, when the POTUS or cabinet members want you, they can easily find you. Chic was correct. Every day was a challenge to filter out the nonscientific ideological requests from those who were self-serving rather than providing selfless service to the nation. Always with dignity and integrity, Chic fought the tobacco wars and other contemporary public health challenges with his greatest asset, the best science. He also treasured the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corp and encouraged them to wear their uniform and be proud of who they are. He admitted to me on one occasion how he grew up in a very strict and conservative family. But he continued to say that his personal upbringing never biased his surgeon general decisions and that he recognized that he was not the surgeon general of the Democratic Party or Republican Party, but rather the doctor of the people.Chic became an iconic figure in life. His legacy is a gift to us. He showed us how we must rise up against political oppression and ideology. He readily accepted the burden of national leadership and never faltered in his quest to be the doctor of the people. He always spoke truth to science and power and became a surgeon general the public was proud of and a role model for me and other surgeons general to aspire to. He was a health warrior whose presence and actions redefined the job description of the surgeon general.A grateful world, nation and cadre of surgeons general who followed in his shadow are forever indebted to Surgeon General Koop's wisdom, fortitude, integrity and selfless service.Now in honor of Surgeon General Koop's legacy, we should ensure that the position of surgeon general is protected from political interference, funded appropriately and nominated from the ranks of career public health professionals who merit consideration as is done in the other uniformed services.Richard Carmona, M.D., M.P.H., FACS17th Surgeon General of the United States"

On March 1 at sundown, participating Americans will start a 24-hour digital detox -- no texting, Instagramming or Pheeding -- as part of the National Day of Unplugging. One San Francisco-based unplugging party, Unplug SF, will celebrate going off the grid with device-free drinks, dancing and mingling, as well as a unique spotlight on our reliance on social media and technology. As soon as they check their cells at the door, guests will get a feel for what tweeting, writing on Facebook and sending e-mails would be like if, say, the internet never existed. ""The idea is to make people aware of how ubiquitous social media is in our daily life,"" Levi Felix, founder of Digital Detox -- who's hosting Unplug SF -- told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""Everything is 'like this,' 'Instagram this,'"" he explained, and our online expectations are taking away from personal, off-screen experiences. As for promoting an off-the-grid event? ""Someone even asked me what the hashtag was for the event,"" he said, a bit begrudgingly. (There isn't one, if you were wondering.)This spoof on social media is hard to imagine if social media is something you rarely go without it. Take a look at some of the things that will be de-digitized, below:""Profile Pictures""  We're so used to seeing photographs of ourselves -- and modifying them with apps like Instagram. Seeing your face in a hand-drawn form is a different way to ""put your own filter on it,"" Felix says. Artists Wilson Erb and Tristan Wright will be sketching live ""profile pictures"" at the event, and all guests are welcome to draw their own portraits. Scrabble  Did you know that ""Words With Friends"" used to be a 3-D, tactile game? Unplug SF attendees can play Scrabble face-to-face. Here's hoping no one loses a tile in the couch cushion!Uploading To ""The Cloud""  Party goers won't have the ""control 'F'"" function to find their important documents -- all they'll have to do is look up. Keyboard  While the keys of a any regular typewriter are the same as your MacBook Pro's, one thing's missing: The ""delete"" button. ""Everything has an 'undo button' nowadays -- you can delete a Facebook post, unsend an email,"" Felix says. Typing on a typewriter will make users more aware of and intentional about their words. ""The Wall""  It's a pretty common practice to write on someone's ""wall,"" but, as Felix points out, ""10 years ago no one would know what that means."" The event's chalkboard wall mimics the public message-aspect of a Facebook wall, but it will create a space for people to play -- together. Board Games   These old-fashioned games will bring unpluggers together: Everyone loves a good board game, or as Felix puts it, ""The most natural ice-breaker.""The Real, Live ""Poke""  There's probably nothing less personal than a Facebook ""poke."" At the Unplug SF event, attendees can ""get poked and have it actually feel good,"" Felix says. The wellness space at the event will feature a massage and tea lounge for anyone who wants to decompress. So, are you unplugging this Friday night? Check in with us after the experience and tell us what you've learned.Make sure to join our “Social Media Anxiety Disorder” Twitter chat before you unplug.

They get beautiful. And they get horny.It's no coincidence these two things go hand-in-hand. Or that they follow divorce. No matter how contentious or acrimonious or downright explosively miserable the end of your marriage was, being divorced is better. It always is. It was sad. It sucked. Now it's better.And when that heavy, nasty weight of your ex leaves and you realize that you will survive and that life does go on, all of a sudden the sun starts to shine a little brighter. You start to notice the different shades of green of the leaves in that tree that has been outside your house for years and years. Your children seem unbelievably wonderful, and your own reflection in the mirror starts to not look so horrible. It is as if those cracks of light inside of you are now on the outside. And everything about you -- on the inside and the outside -- everything is better.And the men. The men! All of a sudden, you start to notice that there are men in the world. Not just people with hair on their arms who smell different that we do. They are men who have bodies and hands and deep voices that offer compliments and eyes -- eyes. Eyes that look at you and make you realize that those men are thinking things. Things about you. And that makes you think those things about yourself, too. And about those men. And those men? They're everywhere.And sooner or later you find ways to be with those men. On dates, and in bed. And you cannot believe how much better it was than the last time around. The last time you were in your 20s! You were silly and looking for a husband and had an agenda! This time? Who cares!? Well, you care -- about everything. About all those feelings and the touching and the joy and the thrill and that passion and the love. Love wasn't this great last time, was it? Could it have gotten better? And yet you care about nothing. None of those things that were on your list. You have those things yourself -- the kids and the house and the career. You start to see the spots in yourself that a man can fill. And you start to see men in different ways. Because you are different.And the men -- they are better, too. There is no speculating this time, no guessing about what he might look like in middle age, or whether he will fulfill all those dazzling plans he lays out, or whether he has the capacity for love and friendship and joy. Because now they have track records and portfolios. Of life. And you shop for them, and try them on and enjoy them. That is the thing about being divorced and dating. You enjoy men. Because you enjoy yourself. And life is full and secure like it wasn't before. And what is more beautiful than that?"

The severity of a crisis or challenge is determined not necessarily by the traumatic situation or event, but by your reaction to it. The word ""crisis"" in Chinese is formed with the characters for ""danger"" and ""opportunity."" A crisis presents traumatic disruption or threat, but it also presents a unique opportunity for growth.While you are in crisis, you are forced to function outside of your normal comfort zone. The sheer nature of a crisis or struggle creates a certain amount of present moment awareness, which is where the solutions live.Our natural inclination is to look and get away from a crisis situation as soon as we possibly can. This desire to avoid pain and upset is a natural human response, but moving through or away from a crisis without taking the time to understand how it has impacted you can be a mistake. The feelings that get kicked up do not disappear because we stop looking at what happened. They go underground and continue to impact your life in ways that can be very confusing. Denying feelings and pushing them down will eventually distort them in such a way that it is difficult to understand why you might be responding to current events in your life in a particular way.Below are a few ideas, influenced by an ancient set of Buddhist concepts, to maximize your growth/benefit from any crisis or challenge. All Experiences Are Part of Your JourneyIf you can accept that all experiences, even the ones you do not want, are part of your life journey, you will look at a crisis or challenge with different eyes. Expecting that there will be difficulties along the way sets you up to react less negatively when things happen. Having patience with the process of your crisis will help you gain insight. Patience allows you to welcome difficulty with strength and endurance rather than fear, anxiety, and avoidance. None of us likes to be in turmoil, but if we can endure the turmoil with strength, without complaining or denying, we become ennobled by it.Find the GemIn every painful experience, there is a gem of self-learning. In order to gain the wisdom and growth from the experience, you must be willing to give up a victim mentality and be open to the profound life lesson that is waiting there for you. There is a gem in that mine of murk and mud! Be Grateful for EverythingDuring the crisis, if you can remember to be grateful for all of your blessings, your pain will be lessened. It is so easy to focus on what is wrong, but no matter what is wrong, there are still so many things that are right. Gratitude softens the harsh sting of a crisis or challenge and helps to instill hope in your heart. I hope you find some of these suggestions helpful. I am always interested in your thoughts and your own experience with a crisis creating an opportunity for growth in your life, so please be generous and share your pearls of wisdom or questions, right here with us.Have an amazing week, and, as always, take care if you.Love Love Love TerriFor more by Terri Cole, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."
