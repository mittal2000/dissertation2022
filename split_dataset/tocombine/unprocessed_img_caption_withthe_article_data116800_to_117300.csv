0,WORLDPOST,A Timely Bunch of Heroes: Why Our World Cup Men Are So Important Right Now,"Bill_Robinson, ContributorBusiness, Technology, Entrepreneurship, Politics & Rock 'n...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-timely-buncha-heroes-wh_b_5534372.html,"Almost nobody thinks the USA can win the World Cup. And if they were eliminated tomorrow, our American team has already exceeded everybodies' expectations. But what if they did?",2014-07-01,2014-03-16-AmericanHeroStoriesartworkv3_1Xactual2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-03-16-AmericanHeroStoriesartworkv3_1Xactual2-thumb.jpg,"As America's perception, our 'brand,' our flag, our leaders, our military and our people undergo a massive decline in respect, something had to give brief relief to the horrible, bungling of America's reputation.Enter America's Pride, our World Cup team. 23 (mostly) young men, most from the heart of America, who carry our flag and our hopes for a new day for America abroad. Some are older (Goalies Tim Howard and Nick Rimando are both 35) and some are young (Midfielder Julian Green is 19) but all are focused on one thing: winning the World Cup. Prior to our great triumph over the much-dreaded American eliminators Ghana and draw (tie) with Portugal, we Americans were mostly a laughingstock for the Euro-experts in their ""futbol"" and we drew particularly harsh ridicule from the Latin world which includes what are acknowledged as the best players in the world: Brasil, Spain, Italy and the other Central/South American teams. The children in these parts of the world are born with soccer balls attached to their feet; and they stay there. Portugal certainly is in this class, however, we Yanks showed them a thing or two about our ""soccer"" on Sunday, June 22nd in the sweat-house of Manaus, Brasil, when Portugal came within seconds of defeat and an almost certain trip home, but just when things looked bleakest, they suspiciously scored a goal with just seconds left in extra time. Why wasn't the game called over a few seconds earlier and who 'controls' when the final whistle is blown? No matter, simply tying Portugal was a major accomplishment Having beaten Ghana on June 16th, America was on a dangerous winning streak and could've easily let themselves down with brimming over confidence. Ghana had eliminated the USA in the prior two World Cups, under some rather poor and less than ideal sportsmanship circumstances, so beating them took America and our players through the roof emotionally and in the standings. Other futbol snobs from the EU, Asia and the other Americas started to finally take notice. And become afraid.They should show fear because America is about to do what we always do ... defy all odds and come out victors against stronger forces.After our crazy 1-0 loss to Germany last Thursday, Americans and our boys in shorts have 'nada' to be ashamed of--quite the contrary, it is Germany and America that carry on to the elite group of 16 finalists. Portugal and Ghana are gone. Have a safe trip home you two. Ciao. Sai wani lookachi.So the USA is still competing strong and giving 'em hell in the World Cup and we should all be proud and sing the Star Spangled Banner with piety. Even if we get quickly eliminated now, we have still proved we're better at our soccer than England, Australia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ghana, Croatia, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Japan, Ecuador, Honduras, Bosnia/Herzegovina, likely Russia and South Korea and America-haters, Iran. Why is our World Cup progress so important, necessary and timely right now? Well, we're about to get political here.America is and has been in trouble for sometime now. Our President's leadership, effectiveness and abilities are being broadly questioned, not only by Conservatives in America, but increasingly by Democrats, Independents, our enemies and even our once stalwart allies abroad.Putin, Assad, the ayatollahs, Kim Jong-un, the Taliban, Al Qaeda and virtually any evil force on Earth thinks we're weak and a country to be pushed hard and ultimately, taken advantage of like pushovers. Our economy is in tatters; though still the strongest, it won't be for long unless some extreme economic changes are made fast. We are approaching $18 trillion in debt; have been operating at a deficit that seems unending and unchallenged by Democrats; the US Treasury is printing more than $75 billion a day and sliding backwards fast on our US bonds; and American debt has been downgraded for the first time ever and is in continued danger of being downgraded again.Our government insists on giving more money, benefits, food-stamps and all manner of giveaways ""to people who need it,"" while piling on the taxes, regulations, lawsuits, IRS, EPA and other terrible encroachments on precisely those businesses, large and small that might someday employ those people who need government entitlements, preventing them from pulling themselves up and becoming tax paying members of society. Talk about a slippery slope.The extraordinary, problematic 'Obamacare' travesty continues to harm the employment, economic, medical and societal situations in America. When our government is filing lawsuits against Catholic/Christian' organizations such Little Sisters of the Poor and Hobby Lobby to force them to provide birth control, we can all be certain that the worst is yet to come.Our energy situation is a bloody mess with no new resources, no new Keystone pipeline, a failed and expensive 'green energy' policy and a continued utter dependence on oil from the region where there's so much trouble.Our military is righteously up in arms because of the way this government has treated them. Beginning with the threatened but never delivered closure of Guantanamo, the military members who have risked their lives and their families who have sacrificed so much, have received a repeated and increasingly violent series of face-slaps by our government. The Benghazi atrocity; Bergdahl' ""Traitor Trade;"" Veteran's Administration debacle; and final insult of our President's confusing and confused speech at West Point, all have our great military angry.Add to the military related scandals above a long, dirty laundry list including: NSA/Snowden ... IRS ... ""Cash for Clunkers"" (anybody remember that one ... anybody?); failed TARP and Stimulus; ATF/Holder' ""Fast & Furious"" gun scandal, GSA, Solyndra, New Black Panthers, ""I've got a pen and a phone threat"" and others too lugubrious to mention here, and you've got an America on the run both at home and overseas. All signs now are, that Obama has himself inexorably placed, like a slot-car, on the road to impeachment.So it it under these dire circumstances that we Americans need a break today. We need to forget about our government run amok and be distracted--not for long, mind you--but for just long enough to watch and be involved with a game we didn't invent or weren't even very good at until recently, and watch perhaps, our brave men show the great American superiority and exceptionalism that makes us what we are. (I won't say 'it' here for fear of offending somebody, somewhere. But you know what I mean.)Almost nobody thinks the USA can win the World Cup. And if they were eliminated tomorrow, our American team has already exceeded everybodies' expectations. But what if they did?Yes, these 23 men, playing games in Brasil, are doing us proud in difficult times. They are doing it with true American pride ... true American valor ... true American grit. God Bless them and God Bless America!"

Sandusky faces more than 350 years in prison for his conviction in June on 45 counts of child sexual abuse, including while he was the defensive coordinator for the Penn State college football team. (Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2bea225000035003747d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By David DeKokHARRISBURG, Pa., June 30 (Reuters) - Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky has hired a new lawyer to pursue another appeal of his conviction on 45 counts of child sex abuse, the attorney said on Monday.Al Lindsay, who leads the Pittsburgh area firm of Lindsay Law Firm, said he plans to file the appeal in the same court in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, where Sandusky, now 70, was sentenced in 2012 to 30 to 60 years in prison.Lindsay would not go into detail about the grounds for a new appeal, although legal experts said that under the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Relief Act, a claim of ineffective legal counsel is one of the few roads open to Sandusky. Nor would he say how he was retained.""It's a long story,"" Lindsay said. ""I got a call.""The deadline for filing the appeal is a year from April 2, the date on which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court shut down the former coach's original round of appeals. His lawyer at the time, Norris Gelman, had argued that the state's case rested on the credibility of the victims and since some of the complaints dated back as long as 16 years, that should have warranted an instruction to the jury on the failure to make a prompt report of sexual abuse.Lindsay said he would likely file the appeal this fall, which also happens to be the time frame for the State Employees Retirement System board to rule on a hearing examiner's recommendation that Sandusky's state pension of nearly $60,000 a year be restored. The examiner said last week that he should receive the taxpayer-funded retirement money because state rules for forfeiting pensions due to sex crimes took effect in 2004 and Sandusky was not a Penn State employee at that time, having retired in 1999.In a case that rocked the world of big-time college sports, Sandusky was found guilty of sexually abusing 10 boys over 15 years, using his position in the prestigious football program to gain access to youth.His one-time boss, coaching legend Joe Paterno lost his job in the aftermath of the scandal. Paterno died in 2012 at age 85. (Editing by Barbara Goldberg and Lisa Shumaker)"

The ISIL led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who is believed to have been operating from inside Syria in recent months, is the main driver of destabilizing violence in Iraq and until recently was the main al-Qaida affiliate there. Al-Qaidaâs general command formally disavowed the group this week, saying it ""is not responsible for its actions."" (AP Photo/militant website, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e9281f00000002252928.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The militant group Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), has declared that it is restoring the Islamic Caliphate, renaming itself as simply the Islamic State (IS) and naming leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as Caliph.The original Caliphate was established in the year 632 in the Arabian peninsula, and the title of Caliph, or Khalif, was given to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq who became the first leader, after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. The word 'Caliph' means successor, and designates the political leader of the Islamic community, or ummah. By using the language of Caliph and Caliphate, ISIS is attempting to establish itself as the leader of a worldwide Muslim movement and mobilize a broad coalition of support by erasing national boundaries.John L. Esposito, Professor of Religion and International Affairs and of Islamic Studies at Georgetown University, told The Huffington Post, ""Historically, the caliph was the successor to the prophet, the political leader of the community, and therefore the head of the early transnational Islamic empire. That's important -- the idea of it being a transnational empire, that reflected the ummah, and transcended national boundaries.""The Caliph Abu Bakr as-Siddiq was a friend and companion of the Prophet Muhammad, though Shi'ite Muslims dispute the legitimacy of his leadership and believe that Ali, his son-in-law, should have been chosen instead. The first four Caliphs are known as the Rashidun in Sunni Islam, which means ""The Rightly Guided"" or ""Righteous"" Caliphs. The Islamic Empire expanded greatly during this time, from Arabia to Persia, Syria, Armenia, Egypt, and Cyprus.The caliphate came to an end in the 20th century, when Mustafa Kemal Ataturk declared Turkey to be a secular state in 1924 and abolished the Ottoman Empire. By announcing the ""restoration of the caliphate,"" ISIS hopes to place itself as a successor in the line of Islamic rulers of empire.Though the caliphate claim is an attempt at greater political and theological legitimacy for ISIS and its militant goals, it makes no difference for the large majority of global Muslims who will not respond to ISIS' call for ""all Muslims to pledge allegiance to (Baghdadi) and support him.""""In terms of legitimacy- unless you're someone who's ready to join a terrorist group at this point, for the vast majority of Muslims there is no legitimacy with this group,"" said Esposito. ""Though there's no appeal to the greater Islamic community, the danger is to what extent can they enhance their appeal, and therefore their legitimacy, in terms of other potential recruits.""The idea of creating an international Islamic state is certainly not a new one, said Esposito. ""It's appealing to an ideal that emerged in the late 20th century, which was put forward by a number of people including the ideologue (Osama) Bin Laden. They talk about reversing the Sykes-Picot Agreement, playing into the notion that that was when the Muslim world became divided. In order to mobilize broad support in the Muslim world, mobilize fighters, and legitimize what they want to do, they talk about the creation of this identity."""
4,RELIGION,Discerning and Hearing Divine Guidance Isn't Always Easy,"Angela Jamene, ContributorWriter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/discerning-and-hearing-di_b_5541745.html,"Sometimes guidance can feel terrifying, I won't lie. Being guided to do the right thing is hard, we worry how it will be received. But, that starts to go away.",2014-06-30,2014-06-29-10298673_10154165958915294_7362156757657149683_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-06-29-10298673_10154165958915294_7362156757657149683_n-thumb.jpg,"It's hard for me to remember that there was a time when I thought I would never be able to say ""I follow divine guidance"", and it was just about 4 days ago.It's difficult to imagine my days, and nights, without that still small voice around. I can't qualify what I get as ""hearing"" something. For the same reasons I can't qualify as seeing things other people don't see, because I don't ""see"" things in the same way I see the physical things we all see. It's similar to seeing and hearing things because what I receive are words and pictures in the broadest sense, but it's just different. It's like.... It's like an idea but it comes in differently. It doesn't show up like you thought about it. It shows up like you have an inbox and you read it more as a feeling than an external sense, it's more like you just understand it.It's not pushy, unless that's what you need or ask for. It isn't ever mean or trying to invoke fear. Ever. It just shows up. It's also pretty easy to ignore if you're trying. A lot of people do. I did. Still do sometimes, but I'm getting farther from that lifestyle. I'm always trying to find ways to listen more.I didn't used to. I used to drown it out. The extra sense used to scare me, by no fault of it's own. I got scared of what would happen as a consequence of following guidance, I didn't want to be weird in that way, I didn't want anyone knowing I wasn't cool.Cool kids didn't follow God and try to be good. Doing good (which is what divine guidance insists you be) is cool in a long term, genuine, and if we're being truly fair kind of way, but being cool as a young person is none of those things. At least, I was afraid that it wasn't. I certainly wasn't. I only listened to that still small voice in those days when I needed it's protection or it was saying what I wanted to hear.I've grown up now and I finally went ahead and said, 30 is the year they learn just how weird I am! I'm going to be Good!Then I waited until I was a few months into 31 and I wrote this.The reality is though, I'm not weird at all. If anything, feeling and almost kinda like seeing and hearing things from an outside divine source is nothing strange. It's been extremely common since the dawn of man. However you believe that dawn happened, when it did it was also the dawn of the divine guidance. I am not the first nor the last to attempt to argue with God in my head like ""Nah, they don't need my help, they would probably just get offended by my offer."" and I'm not the last to stop arguing and just do it, and watch love, kindness, and grace happen as if it was just me being me.But it isn't just me being me. Well, it kind of is, but it isn't my idea. The part that was my idea was the to listen to my prompt and go ""Ok, fine"" part, and do what I was supposed to do. But, the actual meat of the thing comes from something much wiser.Whether you call this omnipresence God, or The Universe, or The Source, or Purplemonkeydishwasher, it's the same. It is not dependent on language, or language restrictions. It's been called ""having a conscience"" and that seems like a logical way to label it but I think that's like feeling the baby kick and having a doctor tell you it's just gas, you know it isn't just gas even though for a lot of people it may have been. It's not the same as ""hearing voices"" either, I think that parallel is drawn to make it easy to dismiss. Even though Joan of Arc famously called her divine guidance her ""voices"", she heard them and saw them externally, as well as having internal guidance, so the name makes sense.There is a lot of money to be made by having guidance. So many people identify with the experience others describe and the advice they translate from the guidance. From psychics, to gurus, to empaths, to angel healers. It's a beautiful community. But, because there is a lot of money, there is a lot of fraud. It's easy to write off as fake because some people have been. It's also convenient to write off, or reserve hesitancy to some degree, because if you truly believe in omnipresence and interconnectedness while you forget to have faith and trust, and you continue to hold onto to fear and anxiety, you're bound to have a breakdown, or any level of freak out.It's more convenient to dismiss the idea all together.But, if you remember all the essential stuff, to keep faith and trust, it balances out. That's where peace and harmony happen. That's the sweet spot where it all starts coming together. That's when you start really having fun. And that's when I started considering this whole ""Let's tell people!"" prompt I kept getting. It sounded too scary before.Let's tell them, it's ok. Let's tell them if they have a ""voice"" telling them to be kind, soft hearted, compassionate, and understanding, it's more than ok and completely ""normal"". If you feel like you need to drown out that voice to try to fit into whatever image or type you think they (whoever they are) want, I totally get it. But, don't.Being ""cool"" isn't what you think it is, no matter what age you are. Being cool is having people say they don't how they could do it without you, being cool is giving someone hope that maybe the whole world isn't a bunch of lying jerks. Trust love, have faith in kindness, provide hope (even if it's just bringing coffee for a struggling coworker), and seek that still small voice you may be trying to ignore, that one that keeps trying to get you to do the right thing even when all your logical judgment and attempt at foresight tell you it's in vain.Sometimes guidance can feel terrifying, I won't lie. Being guided to do the right thing is hard, we worry how it will be received. But, that starts to go away. Each day I gain more confidence, when I thought I was already confident enough, in the guidance I receive. Each day I follow more and more of it without trying to talk myself out of it. I still mess up daily, getting in my own way, but it's getting easier. There is no way to sound normal in conversation when you have to stop and go ""Hold on, there's a woman God is saying I need to help one table over, will you excuse me?"" so most of us just do it and say nothing. When I was 18, I was driving along and my tire popped. I pulled into a gas station and a very unassuming middle aged man stood well back from my window and asked if I had a spare. I popped the trunk and he told me to just stay in my car. He changed my tire and safely put the new one on and when he was done he let me know that he had been a mechanic and it would get me around but I would need a new full size tire. I thanked him and offered to give him the $20 I had on me, he said ""You keep it. My momma always told me God put us here to help each other, so that's what I do."" That stuck with me. Could it have ended badly? Sure. But, it didn't and a good man made sure he took care of his fellow human. And when we take the opportunity to help someone, it takes the opportunity to take advantage of them in their moment of need away from someone who may. It's like a side effect of following God's guidance.There is other guidance out there, it's easy enough to tell the difference though. There are people with sad motivations, there are voices people hear that guide them in harming and hurting, those are not the same thing, nor are they equal in anyway. I choose to ignore those would be guides and opt to align myself with love and kindness, peace and joy. I listen to that still small voice."

How soon we forget. How often we repeat.,2014-06-30,"FILE - In this 1961 file photo, actor Peter O'Toole is shown in the title role in the film ""Lawrence of Arabia. (AP Photo/Columbia Pictures, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ce6b3c000066000df6c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Previously published on BillMoyers.com.As fears grow of a widening war across the Middle East, fed by reports that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) envisions a region-wide, all controlling theocracy, we found ourselves talking about another war. The Great War -- or World War I, as it would come to be called -- was triggered one hundred years ago this month when an assassin shot and killed Austria's Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo. Through a series of tangled alliances and a cascade of misunderstandings and blunders, that single act of violence brought on a bloody catastrophe. More than 37 million people were killed or wounded.In America, if we reflect on World War I at all, we think mostly about the battlefields and trenches of Europe and tend to forget another front in that war -- against the Ottoman Empire of the Turks that dominated the Middle East. A British Army officer named T.E. Lawrence became a hero in the Arab world when he led nomadic Bedouin tribes in battle against Turkish rule. Peter O'Toole immortalized him in the epic movie, ""Lawrence of Arabia.""You may remember the scene when, after dynamiting the Hijaz railway and looting a Turkish supply train, Lawrence is asked by an American reporter, ""What, in your opinion, do these people hope to gain from this war?""""They hope to gain their freedom,"" Lawrence replies, and when the journalist scoffs, insists, ""They're going to get it. I'm going to give it to them.""At war's end, Lawrence's vision of Arab independence was shattered when the Versailles peace conference confirmed the carving of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine into British and French spheres of influence; arbitrary boundaries drawn in the sand to satisfy the appetites of empire -- Britain's Foreign Office even called the former Ottoman lands ""The Great Loot.""The hopeful Lawrence drew his own ""peace map"" of the region, one that paid closer heed to tribal allegiances and rivalries. The map could have saved the world a lot of time, trouble and treasure, one historian said, providing the region ""with a far better starting point than the crude imperial carve up."" Lawrence wrote to a British major in Cairo: ""I'm afraid you will be delayed a long time, cleaning up all the messes and oddments we have left behind us.""Since 2003, as the reckless invasion of Iraq unfolded, demand for Lawrence's book, ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"" increased eightfold. It was taught at the Pentagon and Sandhurst -- Britain's West Point -- for its insights into fighting war in the Middle East. In 2010, Major Niel Smith, who had served as operations officer for the US Army and Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Center, told The Christian Science Monitor, ""T.E. Lawrence has in some ways become the patron saint of the US Army advisory effort in Afghanistan and Iraq.""But then and now, Lawrence's understanding of the ancient and potent jealousies of the people among whom he had lived and fought generally was ignored. In 1920, he wrote for the Times of London an unsettling and prophetic article about Iraq -- then under the thumb of the British. He decried the money spent, the number of troops and loss of life, and warned that his countrymen had been led ""into a trap from which it will be hard to escape with dignity and honor. They have been tricked into it by a steady withholding of information.... Things have been far worse than we have been told, our administration more bloody and inefficient than the public knows. It... may soon be too inflamed for any ordinary cure. We are today not far from a disaster.""Not for the last time in the Middle East would disaster come from the blundering ignorance and blinding arrogance of foreign intruders convinced by magical thinking of their own omnipotence and righteousness. How soon we forget. How often we repeat."

The Egyptian court sentenced the three Al-Jazeera journalists to jail terms ranging from seven to 10 years after accusing them of aiding the blacklisted Brotherhood. Since the army ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013, the authorities have been incensed by the Qatari network's coverage of their deadly crackdown on his supporters.

Before being convicted, he had been detained since December on charges of airing false news and working alongside former president Mohamed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood. The court's decision stunned the world and continues to spark outrage among world leaders, news organizations and human rights groups. After the ruling was given out, Fahmy reportedly shouted out, ""I swear they will pay for this"" from the cage in which defendants sat during the trial.Now Mohamed Fahmy’s brother, Sherif Fahmy, has begun tweeting from Mohamed's account to provide a deeper look into his condition. He began on Monday morning with this tweet:He continued to send out more than 20 tweets about his current situation, prison life, his family and the crisis in Egypt. The tweets, which his brother said came from their last prison visit, provide some commentary on what Mohamed Fahmy thinks of the politics behind the trial. The trial has been widely criticized around the world as an attack on press freedom rather than a fair trial for the three men. Fahmy expressed being angry and infuriated, and denounced Egypt's judicial system as ""not human."" His brother said that he will continue to send tweets to keep his voice ""alive.""
