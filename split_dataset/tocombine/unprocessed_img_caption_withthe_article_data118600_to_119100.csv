Warren will partner with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange and the National Alliance for Mental Illness next month for the first event of what they hope will be a sustained project to get faith leaders more involved with mental health issues and advocacy. (AP Photo/Nick Ut )",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e80c24000031005726af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BALTIMORE (RNS) Sharing how he has coped after his son’s suicide last year, megachurch pastor Rick Warren urged Southern Baptist pastors on Monday (June 9) to let their times of suffering be acts of ministry.“Behind every publicly successful ministry, there is private pain,” Warren said at the Southern Baptist Convention’s Pastors’ Conference. “Pain is God’s megaphone. There is no testimony without a test. There is no message without a mess. There is no impact without criticism.”Warren’s son, Matthew, 27, who suffered from mental illness, killed himself five days after Easter in 2013.“If your brain doesn’t work right and you take a pill, why are you supposed to be ashamed of that?” Warren asked. “It’s just an organ, and we have to remove that stigma.”Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church in Southern California, urged his fellow Southern Baptist pastors to draw close to others when they are suffering. He said a small group of men were on the scene within half an hour to comfort him when Matthew died. They were the same people he met with in their times of crises.“The more intense the pain, the fewer words you should use,” he said. “You need to show up and shut up.”As Warren closed his sermon, he knelt before the crowd and invited pastors to come forward for prayer if they were suffering with someone who is mentally ill or if they were facing other problems.“Your greatest ministry will come out of your deepest hurt,” he said. “We mistakenly think that the world is impressed by how we handle prosperity, but the fact is the world is impressed by how we handle adversity.”"

It is Syriaâs first multi-candidate presidential election in nearly half a century. But the vote on Tuesday, June 3, still has the feel of a referendum and is being touted by Assadâs government as a measuring scale for Syriansâ support of his three-year brutal military crackdown on dissent. (AP Photo/SANA, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ccc02400003100576fee.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last September, Congress said no to plans to bomb Syria, by failing to approve an authorization for the use of military force.Now there is a new push -- exemplified by this New York Times op-ed by former Ambassador Robert Ford -- for deeper U.S. military intervention in Syria. Advocates for U.S. military intervention are assuring us that there will be no direct U.S. bombing of Syria. Instead, so-called ""moderate rebels"" in Syria (whoever they are) will do the bombing on behalf of the U.S., with U.S.-supplied weapons.Ford argues explicitly for supplying Syrian insurgents with surface-to-air missiles, noting approvingly that these missiles could be used against Iran [my emphasis]:Mr. Assad now depends on Iran and Hezbollah for his survival, and Iran's influence in Syria is likely to remain as long as Mr. Assad does.  [...] To achieve this, the Free Syrian Army must have more military hardware, including mortars and rockets to pound airfields to impede regime air supply operations and, subject to reasonable safeguards, surface-to-air missiles. Giving the armed opposition these new capabilities would jolt the Assad military's confidence.Of course, ""Even Iran would have to consider the safety of its supply flights"" is an indirect way of saying, ""I want Syrian insurgents to use U.S.-supplied weapons to shoot down Iranian planes."" It is broadly acknowledged that supplying surface-to-air missiles to Syrian insurgents would be an extremely dangerous step, because these weapons could be used by these insurgents or their comrades-in-arms to shoot down civilian aircraft outside of Syria. Those arguing that the U.S. should supply these weapons to Syrian insurgents have been trying to reassure us that these weapons would be under careful U.S. supervision [""subject to reasonable safeguards,"" Ambassador Ford says.]If the weapons were under U.S. supervision, and they were used to shoot down Iranian aircraft, then there would be no question who the ultimate author of the action was: the United States government. In order for Iran to believe that its aircraft could be shot down by these weapons, the U.S. government would have to give Syrian insurgents permission to use them to shoot down Iranian aircraft.If U.S. weapons are used by U.S.-supplied insurgents to shoot down Iranian aircraft with U.S. approval, the Iranian government would reasonably view that as an act of war against Iran by the United States. How might the Iranian government respond to such an act of war by the United States? Shouldn't we at least consider that before embarking on this course of action?Perhaps you think it's a great idea for Syrian insurgents to shoot down Iranian aircraft with U.S. weapons and U.S. approval. I think it's a terrible idea. But regardless of whether we think this is a great idea or a terrible one, can we agree that before such a momentous decision, members of Congress should publicly weigh in, for or against? Vermont Representative Peter Welch recently led a bipartisan group of 19 Representatives in urging President Obama to resist pressure to transfer manpads to Syrian insurgents. Michigan Representative John Conyers recently tried to amend the National Defense Authorization Act to prohibit the transfer of manpads to Syrian insurgents, but the House Republican leadership wouldn't allow Conyers' amendment to come to a vote.The administration had to go to Congress before bombing Syria because of Congressional pressure. Now, we need members of Congress to speak up and demand  that there be a Congressional vote before supplying manpads to Syrian insurgents."
2,BUSINESS,White People Think One Black Person's Success Proves Racism Is Over,Rebecca Hiscott,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/racism-success-study_n_5474419.html,,2014-06-10,"US President Barack Obama speaks before signing a memorandum on reducing the burden of student loans on June 9, 2014 in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC. AFP PHOTO/Mandel NGAN (Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30e742200005700dbc567.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the votes were tallied for the 2008 presidential election, conservative pundit William Bennett weighed in on the election's significance. “I’ll tell you one thing it means, as a former secretary of education,” Bennett said on CNN. “You don’t take any excuses anymore from anybody who says, ‘The deck is stacked.'”Bennett, who is white, suggested that if Barack Obama could become president, so could any black man. Implicit in the argument was that systemic racial discrimination was no longer keeping black men and women from success. Bennett is far from alone in arguing that a single black American's success is proof that impenetrable racial barriers no longer exist. In fact, it's a common view, according to a recent study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. The study authors, Clayton R. Critcher, assistant professor at University of California Berkeley, and Jane L. Risen, associate professor at the University of Chicago, found that exposure to a single African-American in a high-performing position -- any position outside stereotypical jobs in which blacks “traditionally” excel -- is enough to make whites more likely to deny the existence of systemic racism. “People shifted the blame from vestiges of racism in America to problems in black communities,” Critcher told The Huffington Post over the phone.To test this finding, Critcher and Risen recruited several hundred college students and adults to participate in eight experiments. In each study, participants were asked to identify images of marginally famous individuals. In most cases, all participants were shown the same images, depicting moderately famous white men and women. However in certain cases, one group was presented with an image of a successful African-American, like Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, while others saw an image of a white person of equivalent success, like Lockheed Martin Executive Chairman Robert Stevens. Then, participants were asked their opinion of the role of race in modern America, including whether they felt that race could influence workplace success. The researchers found that non-African-Americans -- whites, Asians and Hispanics -- who had seen images of successful black Americans were less likely to believe that systemic racism persists. This held true even when participants were told these examples represented exceptions. They were told, for instance, that Kenneth Frazier was the only black CEO among Fortune 75 companies.When participants were shown images of successful black Americans who had excelled in fields that the researchers said were believed to be more “traditional” of African-Americans, such as NBA athletes or R & B musicians, they were less inclined to deny systemic racism.Even though most participants indicated that their beliefs about race and discrimination wouldn't change on the basis of a single black person’s success, the experiments showed otherwise, Critcher said. Systemic biases against black Americans are still very real. A recent study found employers may assume black job applicants use illegal drugs more frequently than whites, and the unemployment rate for black college graduates was nearly twice that of whites in 2013. That’s to say nothing of the educational biases against African-Americans, or the racial wealth gap, which has been heightened by the recession. Critcher said he expects this unconscious denial of systemic racism affects economic and social policy. For instance, non-African-American policymakers who believe that race-related inhibitors to success have evaporated may be less likely to back policies that seek to eliminate systemic racial biases, such as affirmative action. In fact, recent Supreme Court decisions made under the assumption that racial discrimination is a thing of the past suggest this view is already having potentially disastrous consequences.""The bias is insidious,” said Critcher. “People weren’t even aware that their beliefs had shifted. That can make it even harder to correct.” "

Nanjiani, who plays Dinesh in the Mike Judge-created series about the tech industry, works alongside fellow cast members and close friends Martin Starr, Zach Woods, Thomas Middleditch and T.J. Miller, some of whom he's known for more than a decade.“I’ve known T.J. since I started doing comedy in Chicago, which was about 12 years. Then Thomas and I met about 10 years ago,” Nanjiani told The Huffington Post over the phone. “I knew all of these guys, and I was a big fan of them before we started filming the show.” According to Nanjiani, Judge was unaware of the actors' pre-existing friendships before he cast them -- and he didn't find out until they were filming the pilot episode. “He came over at one point when we were shooting and was like, ‘Boy, you guys really bonded, huh?’ and I had to be like, ‘We’ve known each other for 10 years!’”(Story continues below)While the chemistry between the show's actors shined through enough to merit a second season order from HBO, it also allowed the group to have an easy time at work while filming season one. During every lunch break, the cast would gather in Nanjiani’s trailer to play his Xbox 360. Nanjiani -- who hosts a podcast about video games with his wife, Emily Gordon -- said they played an entire season of “NBA 2K” throughout filming. (They ultimately lost.)“I remember one day thinking, ‘I don’t really feel like I’m working. Is that bad?’ I literally had to tell myself, ‘No! It shouldn’t be like work to be on a funny TV show,” he said.The gang has been enjoying themselves so much that they might not be kept apart for too long. Nanjiani revealed that a possible live tour with the cast is in the works.“There have been very, very preliminary talks about doing a live ‘Silicon Valley’ tour with all five of us. Very early talks to see if we can do a little tour before we start shooting the next season,” he said. “I would love to do that. I feel like it would be super fun.” When asked what fans can expect from the show in its second season, he wasn’t able to give much information. However, he did say the conversation between Richard and Monica at the end of the season one finale was a pretty direct setup for the tone of season two.(Story continues below)Nanjiani was able to be a little forthcoming about what fans might see from his character, Dinesh, though. He revealed that there's a rich backstory for the character that’s been discussed behind the scenes but has yet to be presented on screen.“We know where he’s from and why he is the way he is and everything,” he said. “I can say that he’s obviously a guy who wants to be very successful, and when he says that he’s afraid of being poor and doesn’t want to be poor [this past season], I think that really speaks to his character.” As far as his stand-up is concerned, Nanjiani has the summer free before filming for ""Silicon Valley"" season two begins. In that time, he's going on a tour, where he hopes to start the early stages of crafting a follow up to his 2013 comedy album, “Beta Male.” “I’ll use the tour to find the holes in my hour and what I need to work on. Then I’ll go back and shoot 'Silicon Valley' until February. Hopefully while I’m doing that I’ll be able to rewrite and perform what little I can and really polish it next year and then try and record another album next summer, early next summer,” he said.(Story continues below)The second season of HBO’s ""Silicon Valley"" is scheduled to premiere next year."

First there's the fresh produce -- corn, tomatoes and peaches -- and then there's the outdoor grilling -- smoky meats, light seafood and charred vegetables -- and of course it's also ice cream season. One of summer's greatest offerings, however, is the abundance of berries. We're talking everything from strawberries to huckleberries -- it's a long, colorful and beautiful list.First, let's get this out of the way: our definition of ""berry"" for the purposes of this post is colloquial, not botanical. Botanically speaking, a berry is ""a fleshy fruit that has multiple seeds on the inside, embedded in the flesh of the ovary."" This means that fruits like bananas, eggplants and chili peppers are berries (yes, they're also fruits). This also means that fruits like strawberries, blackberries and raspberries are not technically berries. A strawberry, for example, is not produced by a single ovary, which means it is not a berry. It is an ""enlarged stem end, or receptacle, in which are partially embedded the many true fruits... popularly called seeds."" In this post, we're referring to all the fruits you commonly call berries -- so don't be alarmed when you see strawberries and raspberries in our list. We're lumping them into the summer bounty we all commonly perceive as berries. According to the true definition of a berry, however, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and boysenberries are not technically berries. Blueberries, huckleberries and gooseberries are.Now that we've settled that, let's take a look at eight gorgeous ""berries"" that we can't wait to eat this summer.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

Our “Making It Work” series profiles successful, dynamic women who are standouts in their fields, peeling back the ""hows"" of their work and their life, taking away lessons we can all apply to our own.If there's something big happening on TV, one doesn't have to search long to find Busy Philipps nearby. Since her breakout days on the short-lived, yet much-adored ""Freaks and Geeks,"" Philipps' résumé has rounded out to include an impressive balance of cult-favorites and commercial successes. A year after ""Geeks"" fell off the air in 2001, she spent two seasons as main character Audrey Liddell on teen drama ""Dawson's Creek."" Roles in 2004's ""White Chicks,"" and 2009's ""He's Just Not That Into You"" sprung up in between season-long arcs in ""ER's"" 13th season and ""Love, Inc.""Philipps' roles on '90s teen dramas not only catapulted the young actor to fame, but grounded her with lifelong friendships. Philipps' ""Freaks and Geeks"" co-star Lizzy Caplan is the godmother of her oldest daughter, and Philipps is godmother to Michelle Williams' daughter Matilda. The ""Dawson's Creek"" co-stars have remained famously close since leaving Capeside, even leading a HelloGiggles writer to declare Philipps ""the perfect friend."" Since 2009, the actress has starred in ""Cougar Town,"" opposite Courtney Cox. Philipps plays Laurie Keller, colleague and confidant to Cox's Jules Cobb, aiding and abetting her through aging, dating -- and a whole lot of wine-drinking. Philipps will film the sixth and final season of ""Cougar Town"" this fall. For now, she's living in Los Angeles with her husband, screenwriter Marc Silverstein, and daughters Birdie Leigh (five) and Cricket Pearl, born last July. HuffPost Women spoke with Philipps in connection to her partnership with Banana Boat's ""Best Summer Ever"" campaign. With an air of lightness that's endured over the course of 15 years in the entertainment industry, Philipps talked success, balance and TV's power to represent dynamic women.The shows you've starred in have earned real cult followings. What kind of women do you like the play? You start working and you're basically an actress-for-hire, so any job that you get is the job that you take for the most part. I was incredibly lucky and blessed -- hashtag blessed [laughs] -- that my first character that I got to play on television was Kim Kelly [from ""Freaks and Geeks,""] who becomes this iconic bad girl with a really soft heart. And then ""Dawson's Creek"" really happened because of ""Freaks and Geeks."" I've always loved working in television because, as a woman, I've felt that the opportunity to really portray a well-rounded female character is greater. I'm not reduced to simply the silly sidekick with four one-liners, or the put-upon wife whose husband is doing all the fun stuff. We talk a lot about how television allows for more character development than movies -- but especially for women, the format seems to create room for dynamic female characters to grow.  One-hundred percent. As I've gotten older and I've become a mom, thinking about the next step and the kind of characters who I want to portray and who I want to be, I really like taking what's on the surface -- take Laurie in ""Cougar Town"" for example, who could really be kind of a one-dimensional character -- and finding my way in and finding out what makes that person real -- is really interesting to me. I think the secret is out. Halle Berry is coming to television -- so Oscar winners are kind of like, ""Wait, what's happening in TV?"" And that's amazing. What is one thing you know now you wish you'd known during your ""Dawson's Creek"" or ""Freaks and Geeks"" years? I think that when you're younger -- and I also started doing this professionally at a very young age, I was 19 when I was doing ""Freaks and Geeks"" -- I had a lot of anxiety that things weren't going to work out and I didn't trust in myself enough. And by the way, maybe that's why I'm still here, it forced me to work [laughs]. But it took me a long time to understand, especially in the work that I do, that when doors close, windows open. And it's OK to not be Rachel McAdams, because you're someone else and you have a totally different career path. There's room enough in this world for everyone. You just have to find your place. What is your definition of success? Oh boy. It's different for everyone, right? I guess my definition of personal success is when I have one of those days where I feel I am able to balance it all and do it all pretty well. No day is going to be perfect. I don't know one mom or wife or working woman who has a day where they think that they've nailed anything. But if you have a day where you feel 80 percent there, that's a win to me. By your definition, do you consider yourself successful? I think that varies. I feel like I'm a successful human. But I feel like your success levels vary from day to day. We all have good days and we all have bad days. What are your plans for the summer? We have really fun summers in my house -- especially since I'm on hiatus from ""Cougar Town."" That's another benefit of working in television when you have children. This year, Banana Boat asked me to partner with them to help them launch their ""Best Summer Ever"" campaign, which felt like a natural fit because I do feel very strongly about sun protection. I love Banana Boat's brand. They don't test on animals, they're natural, their kids products are amazing. I'm personally committed to aging the best summer ever. So people can go to the Banana Boat website to get some helpful tip. I've personally added some arts and crafts that I do with my kids. There's lots of tips on how to get your kids out of the house. Summer is long -- I get it -- parents some days are like ""Wait, what am I doing with them today?"" Banana Boat has stepped up and wants to help parents with kids have a fun summer and make sure that sun safety is also highlighted and super important. Do you have rules you try and follow in terms of balancing work, motherhood and relationships, or do you take it day by day?  I think that I take it day by day, but at the same time, we have a few rules in my house. One of them is that when I'm having time with my kids, I'm really focused on them, so I put the phone away, I close the computer. I make sure that I'm not focused on other things when I'm spending time with my children. I'm fairly lucky because of my TV schedule, I spend half the year working and half the year being a stay-at-home mom. But even when you're a stay-at-home mom, you still have responsibilities and other things you have to do.It is important to give your kids that individualized attention, while also making time for your marriage and for yourself. I have had moments where I've felt like, I'm going to feel a little guilty if I don't put the baby down for her nap today, but I really need to go to that spin class. And that's good for my health and my mental well-being, so I think the nanny can put her down for her nap and I'm going to be OK with that. You have to make those kinds of decisions every day.

HuffPost Entertainment spoke with Whedon about ""Speed"" 20 years after the film's release.Thanks for taking the time to talk to me about ""Speed."" In my whole career, I’ve never had to talk about it. I’ve never signed a copy of it, I’ve never sort of been a part of it. And I was proud of it, I worked hard on it, I had a really great time and I worked with really cool people. I thought it was good stuff. Graham has been very generous, but I did not get a credit on it. The studio gave me one, but then the Writers Guild of America took it away, and I was pretty devastated. I have the only poster with my credit on it.Why did they pull your credit? It has to do with WGA bylaws. You can come in and rewrite all of the dialogue, and still not get credit. They didn't think I made big enough changes to the plot. I actually did a lot of overhaul, but much of it was to a later draft, so it went back to what Graham originally had.Graham credits you with most of the dialogue, and has mentioned that many of the more ridiculous scenes worked because of the lines you wrote for them. How did you go about handling those more over-the-top plot turns? For me, it’s only about everybody playing the reality of the situation, and having time to take out some of the “movie stuff.” There was a draft -- after Graham’s, before I came on –- that was very not good. One of the things it had in it was that Sandra Bullock’s character was a stand-up comic, and I’m like, ""Nobody can ever root for a stand-up comic in this kind of movie!"" And they said, ""Well, if she says something funny, that will explain it."" [Laughs] I thought, ""They’re all going to die and she’s trying to get new material? That’s not it.""Did you make a lot of changes to the characters? I know the biggest overhaul was with Alan Ruck [the tourist]. Alan Ruck’s character was written as an angry lawyer. He was a bad dude. He was like, ""You are a bad cop! I want blah blah blah!” He was that guy. Nobody is doing that in a disaster. They’re frightened, and they’re pulling together. And what was a lawyer doing on a bus? So, I wanted him to be a nicer guy. In an earlier draft, there was sort of this format where everybody told their backstory, and I didn’t think we needed all of that necessarily. But the tourist, he’s a very grounding figure, and Alan is so sympathetic. For me, the whole essence of what I felt was useful in the movie was him saying, “We’re at the airport, I’ve already seen the airport.” When the absurdity has just gone to the point where I can turn to the mundane. Overall, that approach to absurdity is huge part of what keeps ""Speed"" so grounded. I feel the important thing is to let the characters know that they’re in an insane movie. The audience knows it, and unless it’s a fantasy, you need the audience to feel like that’s what they’d be doing on that bus. In the drafts I read, everybody explains their backstory. You know, I say “I,” but [producers] Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald were also brought on right before shooting to shepherd the thing. So, from the start I was working with them, and we had wonderful simpatico. They also felt we should bleed out the things that didn’t feel real, because you are always in danger with this movie.When you worked through the dialogue, did you still operate with those original backstories in mind? There was enough of a background. People were hired to play the people that were in the other drafts. With the exception of Alan Ruck, I didn’t change anybody’s character, so they had something to work off of. You also can read a lot about a person just from who they cast, you know? This guy has a tool belt, this person is wearing a stethoscope, this lady clearly owns cats -- not the album, the creature. So, there’s enough there. Whatever doesn’t need to be dialed in, you want to leave open, in case the actor wants to bring something else. When they’re reacting to something you came up with, you want to leave them that space.Jan spoke about the limitations on dialogue in action films, and mentioned that he appreciated the versatility you brought to ""Speed."" How do you deal with those restrictions in more cliché moments? First of all, you must watch all the movies, as I do -- or did. So, you know all of the clichés, and you know how to avoid them. Sometimes you plant a flag on it and say the opposite of what you expect the person to say. Sometimes you get inside the person’s head, and realize the situation does not require them to say something like, “I’m getting too old for this shit.” You just want to be them. If there’s a way to cleverly tweak a line we’ve heard before, fine, good. But sometimes you don’t want people to notice what they’re saying, because you want them to worry about whether they’re going to live or die. What were some of the biggest changes you saw in reworking those other drafts that weren't great? The biggest change for me came for me came from Keanu. The whole ""Pop quiz, hot shot,"" was not me. There was this idea of Jack as this cop on the edge, who plays by his own rules, you know, ""He's a maverick! He's out of control!"" Apart from “Die Hard,” which really made room for a thoughtful action hero, everybody had been that sort of thing. So, when we sat down with Keanu, Walter Parkes, Laurie MacDonald and Jan, I think, they said, “Keanu, these guys are not mavericks. They’re whole thing is diffusing the situation, and they’re unfailingly polite, and they always say sir or ma’am.” And I was like, “I know exactly what to do! That’s it, that’s the whole meeting, we’re there.” ""Pop quiz, hot shot,"" which Jack repeats back to Dennis Hopper's Howard Payne after he says it earlier in the film, doesn't fit with the character you had in mind? So, I'm not a fan of “Pop quiz, hot shot!” It became a catchphrase, and everybody was led to it, and I get why, but in mind he was a lateral thinker. He would see things, and be calm about it. He would see things -- this came after we sat down and redefined this character -- not as a maverick, but someone whose whole goal is diffusing the situation. These people on the bomb squad are unfailingly polite, and they always say “sir or ma’am, you know? They’re bureaucratic. Despite that line, overall Jack does embody that more thoughtful, pragmatic mindset.  You know, even on the bus, his energy is very kind and giving, and supports the choices he’s trying to make. So, I think that was a huge scene change, getting him from being a rootin’-tootin’ maverick, to being a guy who has a problem he must solve. Going off that redefined idea of a hero, where do you think ""Speed"" fits in the genre?  You know, “Die Hard” is one of those movies that’s not only seminal, but also the best version of itself. Sometimes, directors put work out and wait for someone to do a good version of it, but “Die Hard” really was the best “Die Hard.” Although, I don’t think of “Speed” as a “Die Hard,” I do think it falls into the spectrum of updating the action movie so that the people in it aren’t immortal, gigantic, Schwarzenegger, Dirty Harry, above-the-law kind of titans. We had gone from cool ‘70s guys and Popeye Doyle [from ""The French Connection""] to a much more hyperbolic era. I feel like “Speed” was part of our way out of that, into an action movie that understands that everybody matters. It's more of a disaster-movie-action-movie hybrid. It's based on saving these people, it’s not based on killing the bad guy. It’s also a really inventive notion ... I look to the progression to films like ""The Matrix,"" and I think there's the idea of the peaceful warrior germinating in [""Speed""], and I think that's important.For more on the 20th anniversary of ""Speed,"" head here.This interview has been edited and condensed."

The odds are strong that I'm way off base. Cognac is fancy, foreign, a little intimidating even. If the dad in your life drinks, odds are he'll have some whiskey in the house, be it a Scotch single malt or a no-frills American bourbon. Probably some vodka. Maybe a tequila. But probably no cognac. And that's the point. Cognac is also classy, complex, contemplative -- like Dad himself, if you're lucky, at least in his finer moments. Bestowing a good bottle for Father's Day shows how highly you think of him, and not for nothin', it makes you look pretty damn good yourself.The eight cognacs mentioned here are by no means the comprehensive A-to-Z of the category, but they've got a pretty wide range of flavors and, just as important, a wide range of prices too, from quite affordable to ... well, quite not-affordable. If Dad likes to drink, the chances are good that at least one of them will tickle his taste buds without breaking your bank account.I mention this every Father's Day, because with each passing year of my own Daddyhood, it becomes more important, so here goes again: Really appreciating good spirits involves time. Time to sip, time to ruminate, time to really appreciate its depth of flavor. You can't pound shots of cognac. (Well, you can, but it's strongly discouraged.) So when you're giving a bottle of cognac for Father's Day, you're also implicitly giving the gift of letting Dad take a time-out to drink it every now and then, away from the diapers and the homework and the other assorted hassles that come with parenthood. Give one without the other and you're only giving half a gift.LOUIS ROYER FORCE 53 VSOP (Fine Champagne; 53% alcohol by volume, suggested retail price $40).PERFECT FOR: The dad who has a bar in his home... and likes to use it. Force 53 isn't the most refined cognac out there; neither the grapes used in its distillation nor its aging are what you'd expect from the more hoity-toity brands. But its high proof (most cognacs come in at 40-45% alcohol, while Force 53 is a bruising 53%) gives it muscle, which makes it the go-to cognac for use in mixed drinks. Cognac? In cocktails? Heck yes -- try a Brandy Crusta for starters. And since Force 53 has a dry, powerful, almost whisky-like flavor, it's a perfect brown-spirit stand-in for cocktails featuring whiskey (cognac Old Fashioned, anyone?) or even dark rum (makes an insane Mai Tai, seriously). PIERRE-FERRAND 1840 ORIGINAL FORMULA (Grande Champagne; 45% ABV, $45).PERFECT FOR: The dad who would love a time machine to go with his cognac.David Wondrich, the great colossus of cocktail historians, helped model this 19th century-style cognac on an authentic original 1840-vintage bottle which had miraculously survived the ages. The style is a lot fruitier and more vibrant than the dry and woody cognacs we're familiar with, and what's wrong with that? After all, cognac is made from grapes, so it's nice to actually be able to taste them in the finished product. Try this baby neat or in what will no doubt be the best Sidecar you'll ever try. It's the next best thing to time traveling to antebellum New Orleans... without the stench of horse manure.CAMUS ILE DE RE CLIFFSIDE CELLAR VSOP (Bois Ordinaire; 40% ABV, $100).PERFECT FOR: The iconoclastic dad.For brandy to be called cognac, it has to be made in the Cognac region of France... right? Well, not exactly. There's a small island off the coast, Ile de Re, that's also been granted the appellation required to make official, legal cognac. Why? Well, that's above my pay grade, but I can tell you that Camus' Ile de Re cognacs all have a slightly salty, sea-air quality to them that's a little reminiscent of Islay whiskies. The best of the bunch, and the first cognac I really fell in love with, is Cliffside Cellar. So named because it's aged in casks resting in a cliffside cellar just a few meters from the Atlantic coast, it's rich and round and fruity, with lively notes of orange peel and pear, and a finish that puts you right at the seaside. This is not your father's cognac, but after this Father's Day it might be.DISTILLERIE DU PEYRAT XO (Blend; 40% ABV, $150).PERFECT FOR: The earth-friendly dad.There are plenty of organic spirits out there, but Peyrat is one of the first certified organic cognacs. It's not just the absence of artificial fertilizers and pesticides that will draw Dad to this XO -- it tastes damn good, too. Aged for 12 years, It's got a dry, grapey vibe with the wood present but not dominant, and a spicy, leathery, quite dignified finish that evokes drawing rooms and smoking jackets of old. Any cognac this good that doesn't harm the planet is worth celebrating, on Father's Day or any other day.DELAMAIN VESPER XO (Grande Champagne; 40% ABV, $200).PERFECT FOR: The classicist dad.Most of us have certain preconceptions of what cognac should taste like; oaky, dry, with a certain... gravitas to it. And while it's great to defy expectations, it's also great to deliver what's expected and do it well. Vesper, with its substantial mouthfeel, strong woody presence and lingering, caramel finish, delivers the goods, satisfying that cognac jones the way Led Zeppelin satisfies your classic rock jones or Hemingway satisfies your literature jones. If your dad worked a job he didn't love in order to put you through college without your acquiring a bundle of student debt because, dammit, that's what men are supposed to do, this is the cognac for him.HINE ANTIQUE XO (Grande Champagne; 40% ABV, $200).PERFECT FOR: The dad who mistrusts the big-name brands. Now, don't get me wrong -- Hine has been making cognac for more than 250 years, and doing it very well. But among cognac novices there's Courvoisier, Hennessy, Remy Martin... and everything else. Blame marketing, or the lack thereof. Blame the general public's lack of knowledge. But don't blame yourself, not if you're picking up a bottle of this truly superb cognac for Dad this year. Created in 1920 and revived in 2010 as a 100% Grande Champagne cognac, Antique XO is aged for at least 10 years. It's got a rather delicate, floral aroma which belies its big, fruity, rich and spicy flavors. The long, lively finish will leave Dad craving another sip -- you too, if he's kind enough to split a snifter with you. MARTELL COHIBA XO (Grande Champagne; 43% ABV, $600).PERFECT FOR: The dad who likes to do some smoking along with his drinking.A nice cigar, a snifter of fine aged cognac... a perfect way to end an evening. Or spend your life, for that matter. If your dad is the kind of guy who appreciates these and other fine things -- a well-tailored suit, a juicy steak, 18 holes of golf -- then this is the cognac for him. Aged between 40-50 years, it's designed to complement a fine cigar (it was designed with Cohibas in mind, as you might have figured out). That means it doesn't come on dry and smoky, but full-bodied and a little on the sweet side, with a slightly higher alcohol content than most cognacs to stand up to the powerful smoke and tobacco flavors. It's a match made in heaven. Unfortunately, the price isn't quite as heavenly, but you'll be getting your money's worth, and Dad will have a crown jewel for his liquor cabinet.COURVOISIER L'ESSENCE XO (Grande Champagne & Borderies; 42% ABV, $3,000).PERFECT FOR: The dad who's responsible for your trust fund.You're not just getting a bottle of cognac for your three grand -- you're getting it in a Baccarat tear-shaped crystal decanter, with a stopper inspired by a signet ring given by Napoleon himself to his imperial commanders. You could put sarsaparilla in a package like that and it'd still be pretty impressive. But the liquid is as impressive as the packaging, containing a blend of cognacs dating from the late 20th century all the way back to the early 1900s. You'd think that with cognacs so old, the flavor might be akin to a piece of oak, minus the splinters. But there's a lot of layers to L'Essence, from toffee to dried apricots to tobacco to just a touch of vanilla and honey. This stuff is so elegant, Dad might want to change into some fancy duds just to have a snifter. And if you can afford this cognac, your dad probably has a pretty fancy wardrobe."

For years, I've watched this video whenever I needed a boost of inspiration. You see, from 2006-2008, James Franco took 62 credit-hours per semester at UCLA, which was three times the normal limit. During this time he was on set filming Spiderman 3, Pineapple Express and Milk. And he earned a 3.5 GPA. What a miraculous thing to aspire to.But today, Franco is on Broadway for a limited engagement of the Steinbeck classic, Of Mice and Men. When I went to see his spellbinding performance as George three weeks ago, I was truly blown away. His performance only validated the hard work in what seems to be an ambitious vision in working towards becoming one of the world's few Renaissance men. It's simply inspirational and, nonetheless, I can undoubtedly say that the reason I am writing for The Huffington Post today is because of him.I can remember the moment like it was yesterday. This past winter, I looked on my iPhone before a final exam to only discover an email from Arianna Huffington herself who wanted me to write about my underdog past for the site. I was deeply terrified of what people might think because, at the time, I just had created and launched a successful iPhone application and I didn't want people to say -- being just 18 years old at the time -- ""Who does he think he is?"" But instinctually, I never cared. I thought of James and his writing, acting, directing, paintings, as the list goes on and on. And so for that, I have immense appreciation because it's possibly been the greatest thing that's happened to me thus far. It's just really remarkable what the power of inspiration can have you do.So, meeting him at what seemed to be a hectic stage door experience was really a moment to remember. While I don't want to speak too much on the moment itself, I can say that I was able to say all the words that I've wanted to say to him since I first saw the above video. So, thanks James. I honestly couldn't have thought of a better ending to this school year than meeting one of my modern-day, academic heroes.

10,POLITICS,How Democrats Are Accidentally Helping The Koch Brothers,Zach Carter and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-help-koch-brothers_n_5439780.html,,2014-06-10,"FILE - In this Aug. 30, 2013 file photo, Americans for Prosperity Foundation Chairman David Koch speaks in Orlando, Fla. Democratic Senate candidates are gambling they can turn voters against two obscure billionaire brothers who are funding attacks on them and the presidentâs health care law. Democrats are denouncing Charles and David Koch two of worldâs richest people. The pairâs political network is spending millions on TV ads hitting Democrats in North Carolina and several other states. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says the Kochs are paying huge sums to try to âbuyâ elections and advance a self-serving agenda of low taxes and less regulation. (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cba73c000018010df5d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Over the past two years, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) has repeatedly wrestled with factions of his own party as he tries to bring traditionally uncontroversial bills to the floor, only to see a legislative war break out between tea party hard-liners and old-guard conservatives. But Cantor is currently prepping a bill that will incite a different kind of floor fight -- this time among Democrats.It's supposed to be the kind of procedural bill that wouldn't raise hackles, even during an election year. The House Agriculture Committee cleared it by a voice vote, not even bothering to record the yeas and nays. Many of its major provisions have already passed the House with dozens -- in some cases, hundreds -- of Democratic votes.But Cantor's legislative package is now packed with deregulation items long sought by Wall Street banks that would roll back key sections of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law related to derivatives -- the complex contracts at the heart of the 2008 economic meltdown. And as a result, the bill is at the center of a national struggle over the direction of the Democratic Party's economic policy platform -- how hard it will fight to preserve its 2010 Wall Street overhaul, and how a lengthy intra-party wrestling match over Wall Street campaign funds will be resolved.In a bitter irony for Democrats, two of the people who stand to gain the most from the fracas are none other than Charles and David Koch, the Republican billionaires who have tapped one of the world's largest fortunes to cut down Democrats in elections and fuel conservative reforms. According to a lobbying disclosure form, lobbyists for the Koch empire have pushed for four of the most controversial deregulation provisions in Cantor's latest endeavor.""I think they are gravely mistaken, and I think they're all going to fail,"" says former House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) of the bipartisan effort to chip away at the financial reform law that bears his name. ""I cannot believe that if these became big public issues, that it would benefit the people pushing them.""The Koch and Wall Street-backed deregulation items have all been folded into a bill formally reauthorizing the existence of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission -- the regulator that oversees the multi-trillion-dollar derivatives market. The agency has been functioning without authorization since October, and financial oversight advocates are confident that it can continue to do so unless the GOP passes legislation to defund it. By lumping a host of bipartisan bills together, the CFTC bill is Wall Street's best chance yet to defang Dodd-Frank. The most consequential deregulation bill in the package was introduced in early 2013 as HR 1256. Critics on Capitol Hill blast it as the ""London Whale Loophole Act,"" because it allows U.S. firms to skip Dodd-Frank's trading rules on derivatives, provided they conduct trades in other countries with supposedly similar regulatory regimes.Supporters say the measure would help harmonize international standards. But bank watchdogs see it as fueling a race to the bottom. In 2012, JPMorgan abruptly lost more than $6 billion trading risky derivatives through its London subsidiary -- a jurisdiction that would be exempted from U.S. rules under the bill -- indicating to many that the offshore standards are insufficient.The Obama administration officially opposes the bill.Proponents of stronger regulation are frustrated by the bill's re-emergence after a year of inactivity.""Deregulating the derivatives market and rolling back important reforms in Dodd-Frank brings our economy closer to a sequel of the market crash in 2008 and the Great Recession that followed,” says Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), one of a small core of Democratic Wall Street deregulation opponents that also includes Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Alan Grayson (D-Fla.). The Koch brothers' backing appears to be a sore subject for the bill's top supporters. The office of GOP co-sponsor Scott Garrett, of New Jersey, denied meeting with Koch lobbyists about the bill. Ted Monoson, a spokesman for the other Republican co-sponsor, Mike Conaway of Texas, said the inquiry was ""a dumb question about a serious piece of legislation,"" adding, ""I do not understand the Huffington Post and other liberal’s obsession with attacking Koch industries, which employs 50,000 people in the United States.”The bill's two Democratic co-sponsors Reps. David Scott (D-Ga.) and John Carney (D-Del.), denied meeting with Koch lobbyists, as did two Democrats who co-sponsored a previous version of the bill in 2011, Reps. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) and Jim Himes (D-Conn.). Of the 17 Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee who voted for the bill in committee last spring, 10 denied meeting with the Kochs, and seven did not respond to requests to comment. Most insisted they had no idea the Kochs were pushing for the bill.""It is as if they don't exist,"" emailed David Scott aide Michael Andel, referring to the Kochs. ""Maybe they suck at lobbying, or maybe they wanted a low profile.""Although the Kochs are better-known for fighting environmental regulations and pushing tax cuts for the wealthy, they've always been deeply involved in bank regulatory issues. Like Enron, the Koch empire includes is a hybrid of energy, commodity and financial activity. Unlike Enron, the Kochs haven't been busted for using financial machinations to illegally rig energy markets (although a joint venture between the Kochs and Entergy paid $3 million in 2004 to settle charges that the firm had set up sham transactions and reported false information to market indexes). During the Clinton years, they joined Enron and Wall Street in a successful effort to deregulate the derivatives market. Koch entities served on an official advisory committee for the CFTC under President George W. Bush, and lobbied hard against Dodd-Frank in 2009 and 2010.Wall Street's support on Capitol Hill, of course, has long been obvious. Lobbyists from Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and a host of industry groups representing them barraged both Congress and the CFTC last year to press for offshore loopholes, and the bill's Democratic backers have been raking in campaign contributions from the banking sector.This election cycle, Moore has collected $243,400 from the financial industry, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics -- nearly triple the $89,750 she's raised from organized labor, her next-highest backer. Scott has pulled in $220,160 from finance, compared with $68,000 from unions. The $353,632 Carney has drawn from the financial industry is more than five times what he's received from his next-biggest supporter, lawyers and lobbyists. Himes, who has been in charge of national fundraising for House Democrats since early 2013, has secured $733,600 from the banking sector for his own war chest and political action committee (the Center for Responsive Politics categorizes his next-highest sector as simply ""other""). The bank blitz has clearly had an effect on regulators, who have responded to big bipartisan votes for deregulation in the House with weaker Dodd-Frank rules. Indeed, the most important provision in the CFTC bill is important precisely because it's an area where the agency refused to be cowed by lobbying pressure. But so far, Wall Street hasn't been able to get anything through the Senate, and a big bipartisan vote on the CFTC bill would put pressure on the Senate to approve its own deregulation bill. Wall Street has targeted not just industry-friendly New Democrats on the Financial Services Committee, but members of the traditionally social justice-oriented Congressional Black Caucus to provide left-wing bona fides on deregulation bills since the passage of Dodd-Frank. Few members of Congress have a strong grasp of the policy details for a complex subject like derivatives regulation, and support from typically liberal members can serve as a proxy for how noxious the bill is to progressive sensibilities. The Congressional Black Caucus wields power not only from the votes it can deliver from its own members, but as a barometer of liberal ideology.This coalition of the Black Caucus and New Dems got a passive boost from Frank himself, who waved a host of deregulation bills through the committee on his way out the door. Frank says he let the bills slide because he didn't think they'd become law. They didn't.""In my last term, they were pushing one to try to immunize the overseas derivatives activities of American banks from regulations,"" Frank told HuffPost. ""Then the London Whale blew up and they pulled the bill. If the Republicans controlled the Senate and Mitt Romney was president, I'd say it'd be weakened.""But when Maxine Waters of California replaced Frank, she reversed course, setting off a firestorm within the Congressional Black Caucus and the broader party. ""Waters has been terrific,"" says Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of consumer groups, neighborhood foreclosure activists and labor unions that provides the majority of progressive technical analysis for banking policy on Capitol Hill.When the offshore bill hit the House floor last June, Waters and the AFL-CIO twisted arms, trying to keep Democrats from siding with the GOP. Two Democrats who had voted for the bill in committee abstained from the vote, and another, Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), switched his vote to oppose the legislation. The bill passed 301 to 128, with 73 Democratic supporters.While few pieces of GOP legislation garner dozens of Democratic yeas, the vote was far closer than other deregulation bills that Waters had decided not to fight on the floor -- either because the CFTC had already adopted their key terms, or because she'd secured amendments in committee substantially weakening them.At the time, the 73 votes seemed too few to generate Senate interest. And a year later, the Senate hasn't taken up the bill. But the CFTC bill folds in four other bills -- all advocated by the Koch brothers -- chipping away at Dodd-Frank that were bipartisan blowouts on the floor. One passed 423 to 0. Another, 441 to 12. Adding these to the offshore bill will likely make it harder for Democrats to vote against the overall package.The Kochs' involvement may prove a gift to reform advocates, however. While many Democrats have been willing to make sacrifices to Wall Street in the name of fundraising that enables other policy pursuits, nobody in the party wants to take public credit for checking off items on the Koch brothers' deregulation wish list.Article updated to include information on the 2004 settlement regarding Entergy-Koch Trading."
