We are still over two weeks away from the start of free agency, and most, if not all, clubs' draft plans center around what happens to their team with regards to veteran gains and losses. Once we get through the first few weeks of free agency, we will have a better idea of what each club's needs are going into the Draft.That being said, Eric Galko of Optimum Scouting and myself have put together our post-Combine Mock. Eric made the selections for all the teams drafting in an odd numbered slot, and I did the same with the even numbered picks. We took needs into consideration, but tried to select the best player available with each pick. Neither of us were aware of the other's picks ahead of time. There were plenty of players I was looking to select for my teams that Eric selected with his picks. This may have have led to some out-of-the-box picks on both our parts.Both Eric and I hope you enjoy our Mock 1.0 and we will do another, once we get a handle on free agency. Our next mock will also include some comments as to why each pick was made.1 – Houston – Jadeveon Clowney – DE – South Carolina 2 – St. Louis – Greg Robinson – OT – Auburn 3 – Jacksonville – Teddy Bridgewater – QB – Louisville 4 – Cleveland – Johnny Manziel – QB – Texas A&M  5 – Oakland – Sammy Watkins – WR – Clemson 6 – Atlanta – Khalil Mack – OLB – Buffalo 7 – Tampa Bay – Jake Matthews – OT – Texas A&M 8 – Minnesota – Justin Gilbert – DC – Oklahoma State 9 – Buffalo – Anthony Barr – OLB – UCLA 10 – Detroit – Taylor Lewan – OT – Michigan 11 – Tennessee – Ha Ha Clinton-Dix – DS – Alabama 12 – Giants – Eric Ebron – TE – North Carolina 13 – St. Louis – Calvin Pryor – DS – Louisville 14 – Chicago – Aaron Donald – DT – Pittsburgh 15 – Pittsburgh – Louis Nix – NT – Notre Dame 16 – Dallas – Timmy Jernigan – DT – Florida St. 17 – Baltimore – Jace Amaro – TE – Texas Tech 18 – Jets – Mike Evans – WR – Texas A&M 19 – Miami – Zach Martin – OT – Notre Dame 20 – Arizona – Kyle Fuller – CB – Virginia Tech 21 – Green Bay – C.J.

The legacy of Mardi Gras stretches back to 1857, and since then, some 1,800 parades have brought the party outdoors onto the streets of the Big Easy, attracting roughly one million visitors to the city for the festivities every year. But what is the exact nature of this festival, and how best can you enjoy it? We checked in with a couple of the most informed Mardi Gras sources -- Arthur Hardy, publisher of the Mardi Gras Guide, and Kelly Schulz, VP of Communications and PR, New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau and built you this primer -- read on the make the most of your Carnival trip -- and click through to our New Orleans guides to start planning your trip.AFAR.com Guide: A Beginner's Guide to New OrleansWhat are the origins of Mardi Gras in New Orleans?Arthur Hardy: French Canadian explorer Pierre Lemoyne d'Iberville and his men sailed up from the Mississippi River's mouth and pitched camp 60 miles south of the future site of New Orleans. The date was March 3, 1699. Mardi Gras was being celebrated in Paris. Perhaps feeling a little whimsical, Iberville named the spot Point du Mardi Gras and christened the adjoining channel Bayou du Mardi Gras. In the mid-1700s Mardi Gras was celebrated in private homes and on plantations. In the early 19th century maskers took to the streets. Not until 1857 was the first Mardi Gras parade presented.Kelly Schulz: The Europeans brought with them carnival customs to New Orleans and Creole society was soon masking and dancing at private balls while costumed revelers roamed the streets. The year 1837 marked the first documented parade of masked revelers in New Orleans. Over time, Mardi Gras has continued to expand, but its purpose has stayed the same -- to cast cares aside and celebrate in grandiose fashion.AFAR.com Guide: 9 New New Orleans EatsWho organizes the parade and events today?KS: Many people and organizations are involved in Mardi Gras today, but private krewes [see below] are largely responsible for the parades, pageantry, costumes and balls. Krewes are private social organizations, each bearing a mythological name and symbol, with Comus, Proteus and Rex being some of the oldest.What is the best way to have an authentic Mardi Gras experience?AH: Plan to be in New Orleans from the Friday before Fat Tuesday (Mardi Gras), until the day after (Ash Wednesday). Spend some time in the French Quarter where there are no Mardi Gras parades but there is a lot of activity. View as many parades as possible, because each is different. Dress comfortably and leave valuables at home.AFAR.com Guide: What to Do with One Day in New OrleansKS: Mardi Gras is a an event and a spirit that must be experienced to be understood. Mardi Gras Day is a legal holiday in New Orleans. There are many different ways and places to celebrate, from the more family-friendly viewing areas along St. Charles or the fantastic revelry in the French Quarter. The best way to have an authentic Mardi Gras is to bring your family and friends and simply go with the flow. Pick a meeting spot, bring snacks and beverages to hold you over while waiting for the parade, then join in the merriment. A little Mardi Gras-specific vocabulary, courtesy of New Orleans Convention & Visitors Bureau:  King Cakes -- A party staple from January 6 through Mardi Gras day, the cake is named for the three kings who visited the Christ Child and whose feast, the Epiphany, is celebrated on January 6, the Twelfth Night after Christmas. Traditionally, the cake is a brioche pastry baked in a circle, suggesting a crown (although for convenience, large ones are oval). They are sprinkled with gem-like sugar crystals in the official Mardi Gras colors of purple, green and gold. A plastic baby (symbol of the Christ Child), or in some cases a bean, is baked inside. By custom, the one who finds it throws the next king cake party. Lately, the brioche recipe has been supplemented by a coffee-cake ring alternative. French settlers brought the gâteau des rois to Louisiana in the 18th century. Their original round, flaky pastry pie filled with almond crème and topped by a paper crown is now making a comeback in the French pastry shops around the city.Krewes -- Non-profit Mardi Gras organizations and many are named after mythological figures such as Aphrodite, Eros, Hermes, Pegasus and Thor. Each krewe is completely autonomous and there is no overall coordinator of Carnival activities. The secrecy with which some of the older krewes cloak themselves is part of the mystique of Mardi Gras. Several do not reveal the theme of the parade until the night of the event, and the identity of their royalty is never publicized.AFAR.com Guide: The Best Hotels in New Orleans Doubloons -- Commemorative coins struck for individual krewes, designed with the krewe crest or emblem on one side and the parade and/or ball theme on the other. Some also imprint mottoes; for Rex, it's Pro bono publico, ""For the common good."" The Krewe of Rex tossed the first parade doubloons in 1960. Now usually made of aluminum, some have been minted of bronze, sterling and real gold, given as favors during balls. Rex alone has minted over 18 million doubloons since 1960, and now tosses out about 600,000 on Mardi Gras Day.Learn more Mardi Gras lingo here.Photos by Cheryl Gerber. "

In addition to escaping the heavy winter in Michigan, I was most excited to learn what thought leaders have to say about the role of wisdom in technology and business. The conference started as a 300-person event in 2009 and has evolved into a movement of mindfulness practitioners committed to transforming global awareness of the responsible use of technology and ethical business practice. This year, Wisdom 2.0 was a 2,000-person sold-out event. I was inspired and affirmed to see so many like-minded individuals and organizations working toward a unified and more compassionate, loving, conscious and joyful world. The event brought to light for me new currents of our time, as well as ideas about where I think we could be headed with this electrifying buzz of wisdom. One of the new currents of the digital age is that it is not monks, chaplains, imams, ministers, or counselors that are leading spiritual practices. Mindfulness pioneers like Joan Halifax and Jon Kabat Zinn have been helpful guides and resources to executives from corporations like Google, Intel, Facebook and Medium who led mindfulness practices during the conference. These executives are not only dedicated practitioners themselves, but are also rolling out these practices in their organizations to help with stress, create a happier and more productive workforce and boost employees' concentration. What was most phenomenal to me was to have someone like Arianna Huffington lead us in a short mindfulness practice. I had always admired her for her business accomplishments, but to have her share her journey into this sacred world and how it has transformed her life was inspiring. She not only called on everyone to consider reflecting inwards more often, but also to take it out into the world. As she noted, now that we have the science to validate what we have known for millennia that life is shaped from the inside out, let's make it a practical reality. The second current that I noticed is an emerging community of business leaders introducing a new model of business based on love and compassion. This community sees business as a force capable of solving the world's challenges. In Arianna Huffington's words, we need to change the language to ""put people and planet alongside profit in decision-making."" Furthermore, while interacting with a successful young entrepreneur during the conference, she said, ""I believe this is it. The next chapter of business will be shaped based on doing good for the planet and people and outsmarting technology by learning to consciously disconnect from it."" Some in the conference also proposed having love as the new bottom line. The third current that I noticed from the conference was this desire to be grounded in reality and take practical actions. While movements of change are slowly emerging, the world is far from a perfect place. How might we direct this idealistic energy and sense of goodwill to address suffering and inequality? In the Mission District, where the conference was held, hundreds of homeless people sleep on the sidewalks of one of the world's richest cities. Income inequality is at record high. Moreover, we often do not consider that the products we purchase might have been produced by a forced or trafficked child labor. We all, in some way, contribute to this reality.This experience made me realize that mindfulness is not just about being present in the moment, feeling good, productive or living a happier or healthy life. It is also about being aware of our connection to a broader reality in which one's actions ripple out, affecting others: We should be consciously aware of how our privilege -- or lack of -- informs our worldview. In order to take our wisdom to the next level, it is critical that we ground ourselves in this larger reality that includes an awareness of our connection to the world. Be aware and receptive to different perspectives, knowing they are formed by often vastly different experiences. In other words, our wisdom lies in being constantly aware of the fact that wisdom is a work in progress. Note: Shairf Azami is a Program Officer at the Fetzer Institute, a Wisdom 2.0 sponsor.

(AP Photo/Disney)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9de775250000360036a333.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We haven't had much time for princesses around our house. In retrospect, I don't think that was my doing. I would like to think that I took a stand as a mother and had a well-thought-out approach about appropriate influences on my kids. But, in fact, my sister and I grew up breathlessly waiting for The Wonderful World of Disney each week, and most especially the yearly screening of Cinderella. ""A dream is a wish your heart makes"" -- I still know those lyrics cold. One thing I've felt fairly certain of, however, especially given the research my friend Katty Kay and I have recently turned up for a new book we're writing on women and confidence, is that the traditional princess conceit isn't great for girls and their confidence. Still, it was my kids who drove our relatively princess-free decade as a family. Hugo is 12 now, and Della is 8. My son good-naturedly watched my beloved musicals with me -- My Fair Lady, The King and I -- until he was about 7, and then, that was it. But the cartoon royalty never appealed at all to him. And my daughter seemed to arrive on earth with explicit orders to challenge stereotypes, expectations and, most of all, her parents. From her earliest moments, Della's preferred crashing to walking, risking to waiting, declaring to listening. And, most definitely, superheroes to princesses. She never really hated Sleeping Beauty and her pals. Because of course I tried. But within minutes of watching or reading about their travails, she'd grow perplexed and then bored. And then demand a return to The Justice League or The Flash or, of late, the Power Rangers. Wonder Woman and Cat Woman held little interest. I lost count of the number of painfully predictable exchanges we would experience with well-meaning adults who would innocently ask what she wanted to be when she grew up. ""Batman,"" Della would declare. ""Do you mean Batgirl?"" many would suggest. She'd shake her head in disgust, muttering something about traitors. Or, better yet, growl. Indeed, it's through Della's eyes that I've really learned how far we still have to go for our girls. After all, what life experience gets a mother ready, and full of smart answers, for the nights when her four-year-old daughter wonders how she'll grow up to be batman when she's not a boy?Despite the fact that I'd written an earlier book on women in the workplace with Katty, I've had no education as compelling as the one I got from my daughter. Of course the female versions of those superheroes are far less appealing, when you think about it for even a minute. Just watch who has the best gadgets, the best lines and the most power. For a while, it was a bit startling for me and my husband to hear Della tangle with her brother and declare, in her 5-year-old voice that he ""wouldn't see the light of day"" unless he handed over her toy. But we've decided to go with her flow.So imagine our astonishment when this winter we experienced a substantial fissure in our princess freeze out. My husband had dutifully set off to entertain Della and a few friends at the movies over the holidays. The only option was Frozen. He worried Della would hate it, that it would be another in the line of Princess-finds-true-love movies that she couldn't tolerate. But they went, and Della not only tolerated it, but liked it. The next day, she asked to download a song from the movie. And then another, and another. Pretty catchy, I thought to myself, as I listened. For the next few days we saw a slice of our daughter we didn't know existed. She sashayed around belting out lyrics, talking about sisters and acts of love. It was startling. I overheard her telling her father that she was especially struck by the fact that Anna's act of love was actually ""being really brave, and loving her sister."" This was a movie I had to see, and Della happily went back.I was really blown away, I have to admit. Slightly obsessed, even. Not only are the songs Broadway caliber (for good reason, given the composers' background, it turns out) and the animation exquisite, but the story is truly compelling and creative. It was classic Disney in the best sense, but with a surprisingly modern make-over. I realized, after a day or two of trying to puzzle through my fixation, why it was resonating with me so strongly. Yes, it's great in all the ways a musical should be. But it's laced with a powerful message for girls. And not just that girls can be queens and don't have to get married in the end. Those are critical messages too. But Frozen is a powerful vehicle for showcasing the way girls can build confidence -- and become confident women. Our research has shown us that embracing risk-taking and banishing perfection are critical challenges for girls today. And those themes are everywhere in the film. ""Let it Go,"" the ubiquitous theme song, could be a confidence anthem. Girls today are achieving like never before in school, but the pursuit of perfection, of doing it all and getting it all right, is crippling them. And it inhibits the acquisition of confidence. As Elsa learned, and sings, the pursuit of perfection isn't just a waste of time. It can be soul-draining and even dangerous. Young girls should be encouraged to jettison that ""perfect girl"" and let any ensuing storms rage. Learning to deal with storms is exactly the skill that will help them become confident.And Elsa's parents offer a cautionary lesson for flesh and blood parents as well. Worried about her ""powers,"" they encourage her to ""conceal,"" not ""feel."" Not so great. What a metaphor those gloves are for being encouraged to be the ""good girl."" How easy it is for all of us to encourage our girls to please, to not create trouble. To keep their powers under wraps, lest they prove to be messy. Our girls have to get messy and learn to relish what they can do, even if -- or especially if -- that power causes trouble.Elsa learns to take a big risk -- finally getting out of the box into which she's been stuffed, but Anna is from the start action-oriented, and quite inclined to risk-taking. That is terrific stuff for young girls to see. When thing go bad, she immediately decides to gallop off into the storm after her sister, no man by her side... and no suggestion that she needs one. She happily berates her sweet, ice-man guide when he lumbers along, and isn't afraid to take the lead in battling a giant snow-demon. She makes mistakes and keeps going. Again, critical confidence messages.And the heart of the story, the theme that so clearly reached Della, is fantastic. I love that Disney took the traditional act of love bit, had fun with it, and then turned it into something much more meaningful. Just as the race is on to get Anna a kiss, which will ""solve"" everything, we discover her handsome fiancé is really a jerk. A real life lesson, if ever there was one. And then, a double fake. Anna doesn't even need the kiss from the good guy, Kristoff. She chooses to risk her own life and save her sister instead. Very cool.Yes, there are moments I could have done without. Elsa's transformation into a gorgeous, slinky mountain vixen made me slightly uncomfortable. But as I instinctively looked at my daughter to see what she thought of the high-heels and sequins, she didn't seem to notice. And after all, there was no man she was dressing up for.I've since learned (because I do love to investigate) that Disney had been eager to break out of the old mold for some time, and take some risks. You won't be surprised that, among other critical decisions that were made, Frozen was the result of a significant first: one of the co-directors was a woman.Well done Disney. Now, a female superhero of aspirational quality please! Let's give the little boys something to wonder about."

Based on those words alone, it's easy to think a rare disease automatically translates to a rare experience: battling a condition that is not well-understood, under-researched, and likely without a cure. ""You feel really alone. You feel lonely, you feel powerless, and you feel like your experience is rare,"" actress Patricia Richardson, best known for her roles on ""Home Improvement"" and ""Strong Medicine,"" explains to HuffPost. ""But it's not. There's 30 million Americans with rare diseases. It's not a rare experience. What you're going through is not rare."" Keeping this in mind can help provide the support and strength that is needed to fight against a condition that most people have never heard of, she says.Friday, Feb. 28 is Rare Disease Day, which is an internationally recognized day meant to bring awareness to this public health challenge. According to the Food and Drug Administration, a rare disease is officially classified as such when it affects fewer than 200,000 Americans at any one time. (In Europe, it's defined as affecting fewer than one in 2,000 people.) According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, there are 6,000 to 7,000 rare diseases. Some rare diseases are more well-known than others, and some cancers are even considered rare diseases. NUT midline carcinoma, for instance, is a rare kind of cancer that develops in the ""midline"" of the body (meaning, the chest, upper airways, mouth, sinuses and trachea); only about 30 cases of this cancer are diagnosed each year. Neuroblastoma is another type of rare cancer that mainly affects infants and young children, and develops in the tissues forming the sympathetic nervous system; about 710 children are expected to be diagnosed this year with this kind of cancer, according to the American Association for Cancer Research. Richardson, whose father passed away from a rare brain disorder called progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) nearly a decade ago, explained that the whole process of a medical diagnosis is exponentially harder when it involves a rare disease. Her own father, for instance, was incorrectly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease before finally being correctly diagnosed with PSP. PSP ""looks a lot like Parkinson's -- with Parkinson's, they fall sideways, but with PSP, they fall backwards. With Parkinson's, they can't look sideways, and with PSP they can't look up and down,"" she explains. ""That's why neurologists miss it."" Richardson says that the most important thing a person can do when faced with a rare disease, whether firsthand, or as a caregiver, is to find a support group. Groups such as the National Organization for Rare Disorders -- established in 1983, the same year the Orphan Drug Act was passed to incentivize the development of drugs for rare diseases -- can help to connect people with others going through similar experiences, she said, not only for practical matters (like advice on helping your loved one walk or use the restroom) and information about the condition (such as realizing common symptoms), but also for emotional support. ""The most important thing, and I know this because we didn't have it, is to get support,"" Richardson says. ""It's to connect with other people.""

Ryanair, the love-to-hate Irish airline, hopes to offer transatlantic flights at crazy low prices one day. According to the Telegraph, Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary told the Irish Hotels Federation conference Tuesday that his airline would offer tickets to New York and Boston for €10 (that's £8.26 or $13.81). Flights back to Europe would cost €7.30 (£6.03 or $10.08).These insanely cheap flights won't happen, however, until Ryanair acquires the long-haul aircrafts necessary to make the flights. And that could take up to five years. O'Leary also admitted that extra fees would apply, charging passengers for everything from luggage to meals. Business and first-class seats would also be an additional cost.""We can make money on 99 cent fares in Europe,” O’Leary added. “Not every seat will be €10 of course, there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats.”In October, Norwegian, another budget airline, announced they will be offering transatlantic flights at low -- but not £10 low -- prices.
