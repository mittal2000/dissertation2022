(Photo by Michael Tran/FilmMagic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d9885d3b00004630ec9802.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear Jon Voight,We write to you as admirers of your work for many years. We are also professors of modern Middle Eastern studies, specializing on the history and contemporary realities of Israel, Zionism and Palestine, and between the two of us, we have written and edited over half a dozen books on the country and the two peoples who are destined -- or doomed, depending on your point of view -- to share it. We have read your open letter to Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz and other critics of the latest Israeli bombing and invasion of Gaza, in response to their own open letter condemning Israeli actions during the war. Your passion for defending Israel is clearly as great as your passion for acting. However, behind your passion is a view of Israel's history and current actions that are utterly at odds with the actual history and present-day realities in the country. They are simply dead-wrong, and your belief in them has led you to adopt views that will ultimately -- and at this rate, sooner rather than later -- doom, not defend, Israel. Moreover, while you have laudably said that they or other actors should not face industry sanctions for standing up to Israel, we believe that the intensity of your criticism, coupled with the inaccuracy of the arguments, not only exacerbates the rewriting of the conflict's history in the mainstream media but contributes both to a toxic atmosphere of hatred against Palestinians and to a purported blacklist against them.Let us begin with your opening argument: They are obviously ignorant of the whole story of Israel's birth, when in 1948 the Jewish people were offered by the UN a portion of the land originally set aside for them in 1921, and the Arab Palestinians were offered the other half. The Arabs rejected the offer, and the Jews accepted, only to be attacked by five surrounding Arab countries committed to driving them into the sea. But the Israelis won. The Arabs tried it again in 1967, and again in 1973, launching a sneak attack on the holiest Jewish holiday. Each time the Jews prevailed but not without great loss of life. And when Israel was not fighting a major war, it was defending itself against terrorist campaigns.This is the traditional narrative of Israel's birth, part of what Israeli hisitorian Simha Flapan described as the ""myths"" surrounding Israel in his famous 1987 book The Birth of Israel: Myths and Realities. However, this is a distortion of the actual history, which saw Zionism arrive on the soil of a Palestine that was already in the midst of its own modernization, against which what Israeli sociologist Gershon Shafir describes as a ""militant [Zionist] nationalist movement"" developed, deploying the ""conquest of labor"" and then the ""conquest of land"" to increasingly powerful effect once the British conquered Palestine in 1917. After three decades of British rule that was legally committed -- through the Balfour Declaration and the Palestine Mandate -- to facilitate the creation of a Jewish ""national home"" at the expense of fostering Palestinian Arab nationalism, outright civil war became inevitable. When war finally came, the Zionist leadership ""accepted"" the terms of the 1947 Partition Plan. In reality, they had little intention of actually fulfilling them, and over the next year, through intercommunal conflict and then all-out war, three quarters of a million Palestinians were permanently forced from their homes, and over 500 villages were destroyed. As for your claims that Israel was attacked by surrounding countries determined to throw it into the sea, this too is belied by the historical record. As Oxford University professors Avi Shlaim and Eugene Rogan demonstrated in their book The War for Palestine, Rewriting the History of 1948, minimal and badly trained and equipped forces were sent; their main goals were to prevent themselves from looking like collaborators and their rival Mufti of Jerusalem from establishing a state, and, where possible, to take whatever territory they could for themselves. Most important here, Jordan -- the one neighbor with an effective, British-run army -- had reached a modus vivendi with the Zionist/Israeli leadership in which it would take over the West Bank and leave Israel the rest of the country. The only exception was Jerusalem, about which the two sides couldn't agree and which therefore became the scene of the worst fighting of the war. Let's leave aside the fact that you don't mention the 1956 tripartite invasion of Egypt by Israel, France and the UK, which not even Israelis argue was a defensive war. Similar to your description of 1948, your description of 1967 as the ""Arab trying again"" to destroy Israel is historically inaccurate. There were certainly many threats emanating from Arab capitals in the late spring of 1967, but ultimately it was Israel, not the Arab states, that clearly launched a ""sneak attack."" The CIA even predicted that Israel could wipe out the combined forces of the surrounding states in roughly five days, which is exactly what happened. While presented to the world as a war of survival, 1967 was in fact a war of conquest and expansion. How do we know this? Quite simply because that's just what Israel did: It conquered and occupied the West Bank, Gaza, Sinai and the Golan Heights and proceeded to settle them intensively, particularly in the biblical heartland of the West Bank. Here, Mr. Voight, it is absolutely crucial to understand that if Israel were really afraid to turn over the West Bank to Palestinians for security reasons -- that is, if the occupation were in fact about security -- it could have maintained a military occupation to this day without violating international law. But instead it began a settlement enterprise that came to dominate Israeli political life, eventually placing well over half a million settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, in clear contravention of international law, which expressly forbids transferring civilians from one country into an occupied territory. Indeed, Israel today could withdraw civilian settlers from the West Bank at any moment and bring itself into compliance with international law while continuing to occupy the West Bank militarily indefinitely. But of course it will never do that. In fact, as Israeli scholar Meron Benvenisti already argued back in 1987 with his West Bank Database Project, when there were only about 60,000 settlers (one 10th of the present number), by this time the West Bank was already so integrated into Israel that it would never be possible to withdraw from it. Mr. Voight, have you ever visited the Palestinian West Bank or Gaza or spoken with Palestinians who've suffered under decades of Israeli occupation? Had you been forced to suffer their fate, your anger would certainly be directed elsewhere. During the last five decades Palestinians have suffered continuous expropriation of their lands, collective punishment, destruction of their homes, seizures of their agricultural land and destruction of their trees and crops, extrajudicial executions, exile, kidnapping, torture, use of human shields, economic blockade and closure, constant invasions and bombing, denial of the right to education or development, massive exploitation and then closure. And contrary to your assertion that Israel has ""always labored for peaceful relations,"" it not only completely ignored its obligations to support full Palestinian autonomy in the Camp David Agreements but invaded and occupied another sovereign country, Lebanon, for 19 years.Do you think Israel, which has received hundreds of billions of U.S. tax dollars, should be able to behave like this with impunity? Human Rights Watch has just released a report based on survivors' testimonies demonstrating that Israel shot and bombed fleeing civilians during hostilities, in complete contravention of international law. This is not new, you should know. Israel engaged in similar attacks on fleeing civilians during the 2008-'09 war with Gaza and has in fact killed thousands of Palestinians in this manner. Where is the justice in that? How do such actions make Israel or America safer, freer or more secure? Similarly, today, Israel did not ""give the Palestinians all of Gaza as a peace gesture."" To begin with, Gaza was never a gift Israel could ""give"" to Palestinians. It was not only occupied under international law but legally inseparable from the West Bank. Israel could merely withdraw and then impose a blockade while at the same time intensifying once again its settlements in and control over the West Bank. But that is precisely what then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon did: His goal, according to his then-Bureau Chief Dov Weisglass, was specifically to place the peace process into ""formaldehyde"" and ""freeze"" it while Israel's hold over the West Bank was made permanent, and there has been no major shift in Israeli policy since then. Mr. Voight, do these policies seem ""peaceful"" to you? This is the context to understand why Palestinians elected Hamas in 2006. Even the archconservative New York Post admitted that Hamas was elected not because Palestinians supported terrorism but because Palestinians were completely disgusted with the Palestinian Authority (PA), controlled by Yasser Arafat's Fatah party, which was utterly coopted by and dependent upon Israel and the U.S. and had become hugely corrupt and as brutal as Israel in its treatment of dissent. Hamas did not begin firing missiles into Israel until after it had attempted to remove the newly elected leadership by force in a U.S.- and PA-supported coup. No significant rocket fire occurred until two years after Hamas was elected, during which time Israel continued its siege on Gaza and its ever-tightening stranglehold on the West Bank.If Hamas rightly deserves scorn and punishment for its war crimes (and mistreatment of Palestinians as well), what do Israel's leaders, guilty of far greater crimes, deserve? If we were to hold Hamas and Israel to the same standards, what would you feel that Israeli leaders should receive for their treatment of Palestinians for half a century? There has been no attempt by any Israeli government to make any peace to which any reasonable person could be expected to agree -- that is, one that would enable the creation of a territorially and economically viable Palestinian state. Nor are Israelis still ""attacked by their enemies,"" as peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan and close cooperation with Arab regimes from Morocco to the Persian Gulf make clear.With respect to the present conflict, you are incorrect to say that Javier Bardem and other critics ""have forgotten how this war started. Did Hamas not kidnap and kill three young teenagers for the sake of killing, and celebrated after the killing? What a travesty of justice."" Indeed, this is not what happened. Rather, as reported in great detail in the Israeli media, the Israeli government began a series of attacks on Hamas and other Palestinian activists, arresting, shooting and even killing many in response to a unity deal struck between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in preparation for resumed negotiations. Mr. Voight, there is no way to describe what Israel has done in Gaza other than as a massive crime against humanity. Is it genocide, as the letter that Mr. Bardem and others signed alleges? Given the history of genocide against the Jews -- the very term was invented to describe the Holocaust -- it is tragic that such a characterization can even be considered. But in fact it must be faced, because Israel's actions, which have long been characterized as ""politicide"" or ""spaciocide"" by Israeli and Palestinian scholars such as Baruch Kimmerling and Sari Hanafi, have become so intense that one can no longer take such an accusation off the table.It is undeniable that Israelis have suffered in this present conflict and in the past that led us here, but what is certain is that the suffering that Israel has inflicted upon Palestinians is exponentially greater, and the responsibility for that suffering lies not just with Israel but with the United States, which has, in the words of Jon Stewart, acted as its ""drug dealer"" while pretending to be a caring friend. If you really care about Israel, you will take the time to understand the actual history and present realities, not myths that have no more accuracy than the Wild West fantasies that used to be taught to schoolchildren in the United States. Otherwise, all your passion and concern for Israel will only lead it closer to the very reckoning that you are desperately trying to avoid.Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. Please consider yourself to have an open invitation from the Levantine Center, the largest Middle Eastern cultural center on the West Coast, located in Hollywood, to organize a public forum where these issues can be discussed in a full, thoughtful and respectful manner.Sincerely,Gil Hochberg Professor, Department of Comparative Literature, UCLAMark LeVine Professor, Department of History, UC Irvine and Lund University, Center for Middle Eastern StudiesAn earlier and much-abridged version of this letter appeared as a column on Al Jazeera English on Aug. 13, 2014."

It's perfect for a potluck because you can make it ahead of time. GET THE RECIPE2. Simple Summer Strawberry CakeThis is, without a doubt, one of the simplest, prettiest, most delicious cakes you'll ever make. You can whip it up and have it in the oven in under 15 minutes, and it keeps well for days. What more could you ask for? GET THE RECIPE3. Maryland Crab Cakes with Homemade Tartar SauceHere on the Eastern Shore, eating crabs is a summer pastime: picnic tables covered with brown paper, silver buckets, buttered corn, french fries, cornbread and the unmistakable scent of seafood and Old Bay. You could attempt an all-you-can-eat crab feast at home (live crabs, giant steamers -- yikes!) or just make crab cakes, which are just as delicious and so easy to prepare. GET THE RECIPE4. Thai Crunch Salad with Peanut DressingInspired by the popular Thai Crunch Salad served at California Pizza Kitchen, this salad is made with crisp Napa cabbage, crunchy vegetables and edamame but it's the creamy peanut dressing that makes it so good -- I guarantee you'll want to put it on everything! GET THE RECIPE  5. Grilled Moroccan Meatballs with Yogurt SauceIn this easy recipe -- adapted from Curtis Stone's What's For Dinner -- ground beef is laced with warm spices, fresh herbs and garlic, and then grilled in meatball form until smoky and charred. It's delicious served over couscous with a cooling yogurt-cucumber sauce. GET THE RECIPE6. Best Blueberry MuffinsBursting with fresh blueberries with a tender, cakey crumb and sparkling sugar crust, these really are the best blueberry muffins. I've tried fussier recipes that call for mashing some of the blueberries into the batter or even swirling homemade blueberry jam into the mix, but there's no need for all that -- this simple recipe tops them all. GET THE RECIPE7. Grilled Pesto ShrimpThere are endless ways to use pesto -- the Italian sauce made from olive oil, basil, garlic, nuts and Parmesan cheese -- but this recipe has to be one of my favorites. Whether you serve the dish for dinner with pasta and a vegetable or as an appetizer all alone, the shrimp will disappear in a flash. Trust me, no matter how much you think you'll need, make extra! GET THE RECIPE8. Double Chocolate Zucchini BreadThis Double Chocolate Zucchini Bread makes the perfect afternoon snack whenever you're in need of a chocolate fix. It has a deep chocolate flavor from unsweetened cocoa powder and bittersweet chocolate chips, yet it's not so sweet that it tastes like dessert. It's also loaded with zucchini, so there's some virtue in it. GET THE RECIPE9. Thai Minced Chicken Lettuce CupsBoldly flavored with fresh ginger, lime, chili pepper, fish sauce and brown sugar, these Thai-Style Lettuce Cups are wildly addictive. In fact, whenever I make them for dinner, I have to force myself to put the leftovers in the fridge right away before starting the dishes, otherwise I'll finish them off while no one is watching! GET THE RECIPE10. Warm Couscous Salad with Apricot VinaigretteI love Moroccan food, especially the blending of savory and sweet, which is the idea behind this delicious salad. Made with couscous, scallions, fresh herbs, crunchy almonds and a tangy-sweet apricot vinaigrette, it's the perfect side dish for summer. By that I mean it's wonderfully light, takes mere minutes to make, travels well to a picnic or BBQ, and can be served warm or room temperature. GET THE RECIPE11. Grilled Chicken Wings with Seasoned Buffalo SauceClassic Buffalo wings are fried but I love the flavor and ease of cooking them on the grill -- they are truly no fuss, no muss and finger lickin' good! The key is to cook them over a moderate flame so that the fat renders out and the skin gets nice and crispy. They're delicious plain but the seasoned Buffalo sauce takes them over the top; it's made with garlic and spices, which makes it more flavorful than your typical hot sauce. GET THE RECIPE12. Roasted Tomato SalsaUtterly addictive, this bright and spicy salsa combines vine-ripened tomatoes, onions, garlic, Serrano chiles, cilantro and fresh lime. Unlike most salsas, which are raw, the vegetables in this recipe are roasted -- a technique that intensifies the flavor of the tomatoes, mellows the onions and garlic, and adds a light touch of smokiness. It is hands down my favorite salsa recipe and couldn't be easier to make. GET THE RECIPE13. Zucchini Fritters with Feta & DillThe word fritter usually conjures up something heavy and deep-fried, but these zucchini pancakes are as light and delicate as can be. I like them best as a light vegetarian meal or mezze (small plate) with tzatziki and a Greek salad, but they're also delicious as a side to any Mediterranean-style fish, chicken or lamb dish. GET THE RECIPE14. Banana Pudding ParfaitsBanana Pudding is an old-fashioned Southern dessert traditionally made with layers of Nilla wafers, vanilla pudding and sliced bananas. It can be topped with baked meringue, sweetened whipped cream or cookies. I've tried every variation and many different recipes, and this version beats them all. It bucks tradition a bit, but still tastes wonderfully nostalgic and delicious. GET THE RECIPE15.

3,TASTE,The Best Craft Breweries In America,"The Daily Meal, ContributorAll things food and drink",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-best-craft-breweries_b_5684532.html,Expanding and develop the list of last year's all-star U.S. breweries.,2014-08-16,"Employees work on the bottling line at the Dogfish Head Craft Brewery Inc. facility in Milton, Delaware, U.S., on Wednesday, June 22, 2011.

What better way to begin than by doubling the list (more of a good thing being, of course, excellent), and taking into account the year's most interesting craft beer trends? So go ahead, crack one (or two, if they're session beers!) open and enjoy.Click Here to See All of the 50 Best Craft Breweries in AmericaSo what's changed this year that we should consider when determining the best craft breweries of 2014? Well, for starters, those aforementioned sessions beers have made a major impact this year: low-alcohol brews designed for people who love to drink beer -- and keep sipping it all day long with impunity. The beers are also an interesting brewing challenge: creating a beer that maintains the intensity of the main style's flavor with a lower alcohol content is quite difficult, and we've been excited about the number of impressive successes that have come out in the past year.The relatively new Citra and Mosaic hops have made a big splash, as breweries across the board have been discovering these varieties and featuring them in more and more beers, especially IPAs.Another pleasant shift in the craft-brew zeitgeist has been a new focus on collaborations: many breweries have begun collaborating with other breweries or homebrewers, often resulting in some fantastic, specialty one-off beers. Stone Brewery, for instance, launched W00tStout 2.0 this month, a collaboration with Drew Curtis of Fark.com, Wil Wheaton, and Aisha Tyler. It doesn't get much more fun than that.So how does one go about actually determining which breweries are the best in the U.S.? While this is an admittedly subjective subject -- and one that our readers appear have some very strong opinions on, we might add -- we started the process as impartially as possible: by asking our panel of craft beer experts to nominate breweries they believed in. They chose from among new breweries that have really started to make a name for themselves, as well as older standbys that continue to brew excellent, consistent beer year after year. In the end, we tried to focus on craft breweries that offer a range of great brews, rather than those that offer one particularly stand-out beer.Once the nominations were in (all 118 of them), we asked you, dear readers, to weigh in on which breweries deserved to be recognized. And you responded with a deluge of your well-researched opinions: we received over 13,000 votes, and many write-in opinions: Left Hand, Hailstorm, and Port City Brewing Company, for instance, all received multiple shout-outs from craft beer aficionados who felt they should have been nominated (and we listened: next year, we promise you, they're a lock for round one).While we're proud of our list, and while we believe that it represents some of the best craft breweries in America, we also know that it's truly impossible to narrow down all of the great options to the absolute best brewery in the U.S. So much depends on personal taste, regionality, and your own associations. We're lucky that the craft beer scene has grown exponentially in recent years, and that these days, there are great local craft beers to enjoy everywhere in the United States.Click Here to see the Original Story on The Daily Meal-Jess Novak, The Daily MealMore Content from The Daily Meal:'Craft' Beers That Aren't Really Craft The World's 50 Best Beers 10 Health Benefits of Beer 12 Best Beer Gardens in America"

Militants from the Islamic State, which then called itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, captured Mosul in June and then surged across northern Iraq, taking control of several predominantly Sunni cities. Peshmerga, the forces of the Kurdistan Regional Government, have been fighting fierce battles with the heavily armed Islamic State militants.

We only managed to get two people out alive. The rest had all been killed.""The Pentagon announced that US drones had struck an IS convoy leaving the village on Friday after receiving reports that residents were under attack.The outcome of the latest US strike was not immediately clear.THOUSANDS KIDNAPPED, SAYS AMNESTY Amnesty International, which has been documenting mass abductions in the Sinjar area, says IS has kidnapped thousands of Yazidis since it launched its offensive in the region on August 3.Members of the Christian, Turkmen and other minorities have also been affected by the violence.In New York, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution aimed at weakening the jihadists, who control large areas of neighbouring Syria as well as of Iraq.The resolution ""calls on all member states to take national measures to suppress the flow of foreign terrorist fighters"", and threatens sanctions against anyone involved in their recruitment.When jihadist forces began their Iraq offensive on June 9, Kurdish peshmerga forces initially fared better than retreating federal soldiers, but the US-made weaponry abandoned by government troops turned IS into an even more formidable foe.They were able to sweep through the Sunni Arab heartland north and west of Baghdad in early June, encountering little effective resistance.Many in and outside Iraq say the Shiite-led government was partly to blame by pushing sectarian policies that have marginalised and radicalised the Sunni minority.Outgoing premier Nuri al-Maliki was seen as an obstacle to any progress, and his announcement on Thursday that he was abandoning his efforts to cling to power was welcomed with a sigh of relief at home and abroad.In another potentially game-changing development, 25 Sunni tribes in the western province of Anbar, including some that had previously been on the fence, announced on Friday that they were launching a coordinated effort to oust IS fighters."

She also explains why she is driven to protect wild oceans the way we now protect wild lands. Her goal, like the film, is called Mission Blue.I have known Sylvia for more than 20 years. She is an honorary NRDC trustee and helped design our oceans program. Her passionate commitment to our oceans is a constant source of inspiration.Sylvia is fearless. She was one of the first female aquanauts and has led teams of all-women scientists in underwater research. She has broken deep-sea diving records and walked at 1,200 feet below the surface. And she routinely challenges Congress, CEOs, and international leaders to do more to preserve our oceans riches. As a scientist, Sylvia knows the oceans are in a state of crisis. Industrial fishing fleets have emptied the oceans of 90 percent of the world's large fish, including tuna and swordfish. Less than 2 percent of the ocean is protected. And the pollution that causes climate change is turning oceans more acidic, making it harder for marine creatures to produce shells. This is a grim picture, but the good news is we know how to turn the tide. Sylvia has been a champion for one of our most potent solutions: marine protected areas -- the equivalent of national parks in the ocean. Sylvia calls these areas ""hope spots,"" places where, out of reach of human hands, fish, coral, and other marine species can rebound. NRDC has helped bring hope spots to more of our shared ocean waters. We helped draft and pass a California law creating a network of underwater parks stretching from the Oregon border to the Mexican border. Now 16 percent of California's ocean waters are protected and we are already seeing more vibrant marine life. And just this week, we helped persuade the California Senate to pass a resolution creating ""Safeguard Our Coast Day"" to honor smart coastal management.We are also encouraging President Obama to make the Pacific Remote Island National Monument as fully protected as possible. This pristine area is home to coral gardens, endangered sea turtles and other endangered species. In June, the president announced plans to expand the monument -- originally created by President George W. Bush -- and we are calling on him to make it as large as possible. Here on the East Coast, NRDC is working to preserve the gorgeous underwater canyons and seamounts off the Atlantic Coast. These places are treasure troves of biodiversity -- some species found there have helped with cancer research -- but they are threatened by oil and gas drilling and industrial fishing. We are also working to create protected areas in international waters of the high seas. The high seas account for two thirds of the ocean, but they sit outside any one country's jurisdiction. They're like the neglected stepchild of the oceans. NRDC is urging countries to embrace our shared responsibility for the global ocean. We can turn these and many other places into hope spots. And we can strengthen our communities in the process. The oceans produce up to 70 percent of our oxygen, they shape our climate, and they support an American oceans economy larger than our nation's entire agriculture sector. As Sylvia says, ""Everything that we care about is connected to the ocean. It doesn't matter where on the planet you live, your life depends on the existence of the ocean.""Sylvia has continued to dive well into her late 70s, and she continues to be a passionate champion of the oceans. I encourage you watch this film, draw inspiration from her story, and join us in the effort to protect our wild seas."

Passing this hurdle may also serve to vindicate the cautious approach the Obama Administration has taken in addressing the crisis created by the brutal eruption of the IS.  Iraq's recent problems didn't begin with the advances of the IS. The successes of this horrific and violent extremist movement were in large measure the outgrowth of years of al-Maliki's bad governance and sectarian repression. It was his policies that created the fertile ground enabling the IS's precursor movement -- the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) -- to take root and find allies.   In late 2011, when America was preparing to leave Iraq and al-Maliki was completing the first year of his second term, Zogby Research Services polled Iraqi public opinion. The survey revealed warning signs on the horizon. Two-thirds of all Iraqis told us that they were afraid that with the departure of the U.S. their country would sink into civil war, split into parts, and/or be dominated by a neighboring country. A plurality of respondents in all groups (Sunni Arabs, Shi'a Arabs, and Kurds) were therefore, ""worried"" about the U.S. departure. The survey also established a deep sectarian and ethnic divide, with Sunni Arabs and Kurds being the most worried about the U.S. departure and having the deepest concerns about the future of their country. The poll also revealed al-Maliki to be a polarizing figure. Attitudes towards him were nearly evenly divided among Shi'a Arabs, while three-quarters of Sunni Arabs and Kurds viewed him unfavorably. Most Iraqis indicated that they lacked confidence in al-Maliki's ability to lead the country in the post-occupation period.   Al-Maliki lived up to these negative expectations. With the U.S. departure, he broke his commitment to absorb tens of thousands of decommissioned Sunni ""Sons of Anbar"" into Iraq's military and security services. He tormented prominent Sunni leaders with ""charges"" of ""supporting terrorism"" forcing them into exile. And he operated in an increasingly authoritarian manner maintaining personal control over key national security posts, locking out not only Sunnis but even former Shi'a allies.   In the face of such oppressive sectarian behavior, a disaffected Sunni insurgency in the restive Anbar region was inevitable. And as the brutality of al-Maliki's response matched that of his Syrian neighbor and ally, it was also inevitable that the Iraqi insurgency would become increasingly extreme and that it would develop closer ties with ISIS counterparts operating across the border in Syria.  Al-Maliki's forces engaged in bloody conflict with ISIS and an array of Sunni Arab groups for months. It was not until ISIS and company overran Mosul in the face of a disintegrating Iraqi military, that al-Maliki felt the need to appeal to the U.S. for assistance. This presented the Obama Administration with both domestic and foreign policy challenges.  Conservatives, who had long blamed the President for having left Iraq in the first place, were now hounding him to become militarily engaged in confronting ISIS. Liberals, on the other hand, were war-averse and cautioned against any involvement, fearing ""mission creep.""  For its part, the Administration saw the need to balance several imperatives: the need to confront and help defeat what had become a transnational menace; the recognition that we had a responsibility to Iraq and to the Americans and Iraqis who had lost their lives during that long war; and the understanding that Iraqi reform and not American force was the key to any solution.  Aware of both the regional and world-wide threat posed by IS and the problems created by al Maliki's sectarian rule, the Obama Administration took a cautious approach. Making it clear that they did not want to strengthen al Maliki's hand, the U.S. conditioned support for the Iraqi military on the establishment of a more inclusive and representative government in Baghdad. At the same time, so as not to give the IS a free ride, the U.S. provided emergency airlifts to beleaguered refugees fleeing IS brutality and used air power to strike at both IS advance positions and to destroy some of the military equipment the extremists had seized when they overran Iraqi military positions in Mosul.   Even this limited engagement paid dividends. It provided many of the previously trapped refugees with the cover they needed to escape. It enabled Kurdish forces the opportunity to regroup and retake some areas that had fallen under the control of the IS. And with the U.S. back in the game, it became clear to Iraqis that only with al-Maliki out of the way could the Iraqi military and political system secure the support they needed to win a decisive victory over the extremist Sunni militants.  Had the knee-jerk liberals had their way, the Obama Administration would have done nothing for fear of becoming ground down in another Iraqi war we could not win. Had the knee-jerk conservatives won the day, the U.S. would have supported al-Maliki with military force and more advanced weapons thereby reinforcing his corrupt, autocratic and sectarian rule.  Instead of these approaches, both of which would have had certain negative consequences, the Obama approach recognized that the problem of the IS was created by bad governance and could only be remedied by Iraqis moving in a different direction. With al-Maliki gone, one hurdle has been passed. In the next month, prime minister designee al-Abadi must make critical decisions. He must form a government that will be inclusive of all segments of Iraqi society -- Shi'a and Sunni Arabs, Kurds, Christians, Turkamen, and other minorities. He must act quickly to re-engage Sunni leaders who were forced into exile by his predecessor. He must also create new opportunities for disaffected Sunni Arabs and Kurds so that they see the government in Baghdad as representing their interests.  This struggle against the IS in Iraq is only one front in what will be a long and protracted conflict against militant extremism in the Levant. Denying the group its support base in Iraq will weaken it, but this is only the first step. The Iraqi military will need to finish the job by defeating the group militarily. Then comes the more difficult task of tackling the group's base of operations in Syria -- a situation made more difficult by the very different circumstances that exist in that country.Follow @AAIUSA for more."

The birth of the world's newest nation and its newest failed state -- the Islamic State -- have served to demonstrate just how feeble the established international order has become.Isolationist America's foreign policy and standing in the world has been further emasculated in the process. Conservative political pundits in the U.S. criticize President Obama for failing to act in a more decisive manner to stem the tide. They remain delusional in their belief that anything the U.S. can do will make a difference. Many Americans, and much of the rest of the world, want to believe that the decade-long Iraq War was a success and that it achieved its objective -- but it did not. The war merely served to underscore how frail the underpinnings of the modern Iraqi state was to begin with.The truth is that Syria and Iraq are slowly disintegrating. Short of committing hundreds of thousands of troops to both countries in a lengthy and sustained battle -- which will not happen -- it seems likely that, at a minimum, ISIS will retain the gains it has made, and will claim even greater territory in Syria, Iraq, and greater Kurdistan in the weeks and months to come. We should all be very concerned.Apart from the evisceration of the ancient regime in the Middle East, the rise of ISIS -- and the proliferation of other extremist groups such as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and Boko Haram and Al Shabaab in Africa -- represents a world order in transition. The Post War powers are threatened by non-state actors whose strength far outweighs their numbers and materiel. It is a testament to the inherent contradictions of the Post War order that so many Failed States were created by it. These groups are masterful at taking advantage of that. So as the Post War order slowly crumbles, a new world order based on an entirely new set of dynamics is being created. Our G-Zero world is in essence being replaced by a G-41 world. In 2004 there was a total of 21 Islamic terrorist groups in 18 countries; Today, there are 41 such groups in 24 countries. It is these groups, rather than the BRICS, MINTS and CIVETS, that are increasingly shaping the evolving world order. Scores of centrifugal forces, many of which are uncontrollable, have come to define the political and military regime of the 21st century. Given that we live in a world of limited financial and military resources, and that developed countries at large lack the political will to become more engaged in conflicts in their own backyard as well as half a world away, we had better get used to the idea that there will remain a plethora of raging fires that no one can put out. ISIS may be the first extremist movement to be as successful as it has been, but it is unlikely to be the last. Welcome to the G-41 world._____________ *Daniel Wagner is CEO of Country Risk Solutions and author of the book ""Managing Country Risk"".This article first appeared in the South China Morning Post under the title ""The Rise of the Islamic State Signals a Changing World Order."""

And I didn't watch it before this writing. It's like precious jewelry, something to be seen only on the most profound of occasions. In the clip, I'm with my family, four older siblings and Mom, at what I think is a train station. We are all waiting, anxiously, for something. I don't know my exact age, but it had to be before I turned six.The camera moves, and a gigantic, larger-than-life man enters the shot, wearing a suit and black glasses, fashionable 1969 wear. I hug him around his legs like he's my very own Disney character come to life, and, while I don't remember this particular day, the sensation of my dad's embrace is as fresh and warm as just-baked bread. I know I'm no older than five in the clip because that's the age I was when my father killed himself, probably soon after this home movie was made. He jumped off the Benicia Bridge in northern California, two years after he and my mother divorced, and 37 years after being born. Dad was many things: excellent student, attractive as he was popular, captain of the basketball and football team. He married the college homecoming queen and head cheerleader, and they ended up at MIT, where he taught Economics under the tutulage of future Secretary of State George Schultz. He then embarked on a career at Kaiser that took him, finally, to sunny California. Dad was many other things, too. To protect my family's privacy, I won't go into specific details, but it's fair to say he was often extremely unhappy, and he suffered from severe mental illness for most, if not all, of his adult life. His disease progressed as he got older, he drank more, he got bloated, he lost the sparkle that's so visible in early photographs, he turned violent, he thought people were chasing him.I witnessed none of this. After my parents got divorced, I saw my father every other weekend, when my two sisters and I got to stay at his Oakland, California, apartment, about 20 minutes from home. We alternated with my brothers, the eldest. Those weekends are encased in a gold leaf box. He would take us to the zoo, or sometimes to a place called Fairy Land, which I don't remember much about except that it was green with lots of water and a windmill and there were rides and Dad was present and brilliant in the light. There was no arguing, there did not exist sadness, in those days life was as it should be, miraculous. The only memory more wonderful than actual weekends with Dad was when he drove up in a yellow car to pick us up. Later, that car would be found next to the bridge where he took his final look at the world, the car vacant, the motor off, those seat belts that he insisted we use probably unlocked. Mom would announce that Dad was here, and the five of us would run out to the yard, where he'd greet each one of us by picking us up in his arms and swinging us around until we got dizzy. I remember pleading with him to ""swing me around,"" and the waterfall of delights at this recollection blends in with the smell of cut grass, our suburban, happy home yard. Shortly after my dad's death, a boy approached me in kindergarten class and said, in what seemed like a maniacal tone, ""I know how your dad died."" I was baffled because I knew how my dad died too. What I didn't know was that, in some circles, suicide was considered something to be ashamed of, a failure, a sin, cowardly. And an act that spreads like fever. Our family was marked, as was my mom, who was even accused of murdering my father, an accusation that came from his mother. Dad's parents' shame at their son's death was not something they could comprehend, and not something they could take responsibility for. She also had a theory that the CIA assassinated him. On their many unpleasant visits after my father died, the subject never came up. My father's memory was as non-existent as their warmth. My uncle, Dad's only brother, never mentioned him when he and his family would visit. He did spend a lot of time bragging about his children, but my father was never a part of conversation. I never met my dad's sister, but right before she died she called me to talk, to say goodbye to a grown-up nephew she'd never met. I immediately asked her about Dad and she said something about him being wonderful and outgoing and fun and then the phone was taken away from her by one of her children, who told me she was getting weak. She died within a month. I've discovered that, too often, when a family member kills himself, not only does he die but his memory dies with him. On one side of the family, Dad's existence was erased the moment his feet left that ledge. In my home, my mother talked a lot about Dad's death, made it clear that he loved us very much, and, when questioned as to why he would take his own life, explained that he was very sick and could not get the help he needed. There was never any shame or secrecy in my father's death because it was not presented as shameful or something that needed to be hidden. It was terribly, terribly sad, and I'm usually reminded of my dad when I hear someone talking about losing a parent at a young age due to cancer or some other horrible disease. Years after my dad died, on a bicycle ride with my friend Don, he told me he knew about my father and that someone, probably his mom, wanted to make sure I knew he didn't think less of my family. His intentions were only sincere and his actions very astute for a young child, but I was still puzzled. Everyone seemed to have a problem with how my dad died except me.  My father, Maynard Toussaint, in an undated high school photo. I can't speak for anyone else in my family or anyone else who has experienced the suicide of a close friend or relative. I can speak to anyone who refers to suicide as selfish or cowardly, to assure them that, in my case, I never pictured my dad as either. Like my dad, I have suffered extreme mental illness starting at the age of 16, horrifying, crippling, excruciating pain that can only be described as living in someone else's nightmare, because you can't control when you wake up. I knew from a young age that children were out of the question because to possibly expose them to my hell would be an unforgivable offense. Later, marriage was out of the question, as, should my illness strike during the engagement period, I'd be living in forced happiness, pretending to be excited and joyful. Concealing pain is the cruelest sidebar to living with the pain to begin with. Later, my career was out of the question, because you can't pursue your dreams when half of your life is spent climbing a tilted flat cliff with rocks tumbling over your head. Unlike my father, I never wanted to end my life. In my early 30s, after more doctors than I can remember, I found a drug combination that worked, three different pills that I take to this day, and which are adjusted periodically, with about a 75 percent success rate. For about a month out of each year, I'm in pain. For all of the year, I have no idea when disease will strike. It's like predicting a cold. I'm also extremely lucky because mental illness has achieved greater acceptance, and greater understanding in the medical world, and because I was never encouraged by my mother to hide it or be ashamed of it. If I'm going through a bad spell, I tell my close friends. Talking, I learned years ago, releases the cloud and can sometimes even poke a hole into whatever's contained inside your sealed-up box. None of my own experiences combined with what I know of my father's life make me think any less of a person who chooses suicide. In this week of unhappy reflection, I've found myself repeating that phrase a lot. Who are any of us to understand what pain another is going through, or to what depths? How do I know that, even if my father had access to the medical advances I've received, he would have survived? There's also the question of mental illness caused by a chemical imbalance versus or combined with despair from another source. Maybe my father's unhappiness was triggered by factors beyond my comprehension. Are any of us in a position to say that every person born to this, admittedly difficult, life is equipped with the tools to survive it? And to that end, know that suicide is always the wrong choice? Perhaps for some it's the only one. When do we stop placing blame and start showing compassion? We do it now, and, as I learned from a tale of two suicide aftermaths, we don't hide the diseased or the diseases, we don't erase the departed, and we don't relinquish dignity from those who suffered. We learn from them. We even laugh. About a year back my mother and I got into a giggle fit over the topic of dad's death and strangers. Both of us have had the same experience many times: Is he still alive? ""No, he's not."" ... When did he die? ""1969."" ...Oh, I'm sorry. May I ask what he died of? ""He killed himself."" ... longer pause ... ""Oh, I'm so sorry. May I ask how? ""He jumped off a bridge."" And the conversation stops, the poor stranger blushing and apologizing repeatedly. After more than 45 years, we deserve a little humor. Trying to imagine a world with my father in it is like trying to imagine an alternate universe. He'd be 83, and I have no idea if we would have gotten along, if he'd have approved of my homosexuality, of a man who couldn't catch a ball unless Streisand tickets were attached, how his presence would have shaped the lives of my brothers and sisters, if he would have been happy and healthy. He might have remained cruel. So is trying to imagine a world completely without him. He's in me, in memory and in mind, and my entrance to the world was shaped in huge part by his magnificent existence. I wear his wedding band on my right hand, and, though Mom says she paid about 20 bucks for it, to me it might as well be the Holy Grail. It makes me feel alive to what connects us, and to be reminded that everything I do is in part because of him. I can see it now as I look down at the keyboard.

18,POLITICS,Why Los Angeles Sends Failing Students On To The Next Grade,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/los-angeles-failing-students_n_5682751.html,,2014-08-15,"Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy takes his seat following a closed-door meeting of the Board of Education in downtown Los Angeles Tuesday, Feb. 7, 2012. Prosecutors have filed a lewd-acts complaint against the second of two teachers removed from a Los Angeles-area elementary school, and the Board voted to fire him in the closed-door meeting. On Monday night Deasy said that more than 120 staff members at Miramonte Elementary School â everyone from the principal and teachers to the cafeteria workers â were being replaced because a full investigation of the allegations will be disruptive and staffers will require support to get through the scandal.

But by seventh grade, he was smoking and doing graffiti to impress kids and shed his reputation as the “dumb” older kid.When he was kicked out of his middle school, in the San Fernando Valley just north of Los Angeles, Cortes saw a chance to solve the problem. At the new school to which he was assigned, he asked to jump ahead a year, to eighth grade, so he could join the other kids his age. Because of his age, school administrators agreed. But by the time he got to high school -- after only a couple months in eighth grade -- Cortes was still behind academically. After a few months, he dropped out.Cortes’s experience -- being retained because of his grades and later promoted despite them -- is indicative of the confusion in districts across the country about how best to deal with struggling students. Research shows that often retention can have negative effects on students. Nevertheless, a growing chorus of critics over the past two decades, including President Obama, have urged schools to end “social promotion,” the practice of passing failing students onto the next grade.“This notion that we should just graduate kids because they’ve reached a certain age and we don’t want to embarrass them, despite the fact that they may not be able to read, that is a disservice to students,” Obama said in 2010.This logic has led 15 states and the District of Columbia to adopt policies requiring third-grade reading proficiency before a student can be promoted. Large urban districts, like New York City and Chicago, have also experimented with ending social promotion.But despite promises and new policies meant to hold more students back until they’ve mastered grade-level material, a University of Minnesota study currently under peer review found that student retention is actually on the decline. Retention rates are not tracked annually on a national level and most data that exists is collected through surveys, so the researchers used grade level enrollment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate that retention rates hovered around 2.7 percent from 1995 to 2005. After that, the number of students held back actually began to decline, hitting 1.5 percent in 2009.John Robert Warren, one of the authors of the paper, said he doesn’t know why retention rates have declined, but is doing research to investigate the reasons.California, which passed a 1998 law meant to reduce the promotion of students like Cortes, is an example of why the hype over banning social promotion hasn’t matched the reality in classrooms.California education code states that students who don’t meet grade standards -- as measured by state standardized tests at promotion “gates” in elementary and middle schools -- must repeat the grade. Those gates are at second, third, and fourth grades and at the completion of middle school in eighth grade. But there’s a catch, which exists in nearly all state retention laws: A student can be promoted if the teacher decides retention isn’t appropriate for that child. That is how the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the nation’s second-largest school district, where Cortes attended school, has been promoting failing students.“People are kind of reluctant to hold a kid back,” said Arzie Galvez, a LAUSD district administrative coordinator who oversaw a committee of teachers and administrators convened in 2011 to study social promotion. “If you survey people they’ll say social promotion is wrong but when the rubber meets the road a lot of staff members are reluctant to (retain students).”Retention rates in the district, much higher than Warren’s estimates of national averages, sit around 7.5 percent, according to Galvez. The district found, though, that promoting struggling students and letting them fend for themselves didn’t work either. While the LAUSD school board has not eliminated the possibility of a true ban on social promotion, in the meantime it is beefing up efforts to increase the number of interventions available for students passed along based on age.At first, Cortes saw being so easily moved to eighth and then ninth grade as a positive. “I was happy because I didn’t do a year of school,” he said. “I wasn’t worried about grades.”But things unraveled quickly at San Fernando High School, when he received no additional help or support and the work became challenging. To make matters worse, his teachers didn’t seem to care that he was behind, Cortes said.LAUSD is now looking to promote struggling students with their class -- so they don’t feel stigmatized, as Cortes did -- while offering more attention when they move to the next grade.“What we found is that if you (promote a student), you also needed to provide support, additional academic support, so that you could fill in those gaps,” Galvez said of the district’s renewed focus on intervening when students aren’t performing at grade level. “Social promotion in and of itself, it’s not bad.”As they have been able to do for years, district teachers may recommend a student move forward and tap into intervention programs: The student may take double courses in a challenging subject, receive tutoring or work with counselors or aides.The intervention program has many arms, says Javier Sandoval, an intervention administrator who retired from the district in June. He said the various parts of the program -- intervention courses, summer school, credit recovery offerings, after-school tutoring -- are all funded differently depending on the schools.At the high school level, for instance, the district is funding a $4.1 million program, the Academic Accelerated Literacy program, which provides smaller classes in challenging subjects for failing students during the school day. LAUSD also spent $21.5 million this year to bolster its summer school intervention program -- Beyond the Bell -- that served more than 54,800 students in kindergarten to 12th grade, a huge increase from 6,200 last year, according to Janet Kiddoo, who replaced Sandoval as the program’s intervention specialist.“The philosophy here in the district has been to pass the money on to the schools so that they can do their own programs,” Sandoval said. “We have much more local control and local oversight over what intervention programs are being provided.”Some research supports LAUSD’s methods. Studies have suggested that students held back can be victims of bullying; they also may feel developmentally out of place or psychologically discouraged and often perform worse than their socially-promoted peers. Additional studies show that when kids are held back, academic performance even suffers among the student’s classmates.Russ Rumberger, professor of education at the University of California Santa Barbara, supports the strategies LAUSD is adopting. “The reason I think retention isn’t necessarily a very helpful practice is that I think the typical situation is to simply repeat a grade and not necessarily address the reasons a kid was failing in the first place,” he said. “The idea is to give them the extra interventions in the grade level that they are in, such that they are not going to be retained.”But Marcus Winters, a professor of education at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, is hoping his research over the last decade will change people’s minds about retention. He believes that holding students back while also providing interventions can have a much more positive effect than sending them on to the next grade, even with extra help.Winters looked at retained students in Florida after a retention law was instituted in 2003. Winters narrowed the pool of students to those within a small margin both above and below the cutoff for retention, which he said was basically the difference of one or two problems on the state standardized test.Students below the cutoff were retained and given extra support during the following year, while students above were moved on to the next grade.“We found that the kids who received this retention and remediation treatment in third grade, there’s big positive immediate effect in those first couple of years,” Winters said. “That effect tended to fade a little bit over time, but even by the time they were in the seventh grade there was still a pretty large -- not only statistically significant but really meaningful -- positive effect from receiving that treatment in third grade.”Winters is still waiting on graduation data, but said he’s optimistic about the results.“The high-quality research that has happened over the last couple of years has really pointed us in the direction that (retention) might be a productive policy,” he said.Winters said most of the research showing retention has a negative effect on students was not as rigorous as more recent studies. He pointed to a 2009 study by Education Evaluation and Policy Analysis that looked at 22 studies on grade retention and found that well-designed research suggests that holding students back has no effect on student achievement.Though researchers, such as Winters, use the study to cast doubts on the negative effects of retention, it fails to actually support the practice. The study included a caveat: “Given the expense of grade retention and the emotional toil retention exacts on students, a finding of ‘no significant difference’ for retention on achievement calls into question the educational benefits of grade retention policies.”Though researchers, such as Winters, use the study to cast doubts on the negative effects of retention, it fails to actually support the practice. The study included a caveat: “Given the expense of grade retention and the emotional toil retention exacts on students, a finding of ‘no significant difference’ for retention on achievement calls into question the educational benefits of grade retention policies.”And even Florida -- where retention rates jumped nearly a third in the 2002-2003 school year and which has been recognized nationally for its crackdown on social promotion -- saw retention rates fall not long after social promotion was supposed to end. Within five years, the percentage of students held back had dropped back down to 2001-2002 levels and continued to decrease steadily.Winters says though it’s difficult to prove, he believes declining retention rates could be a result of the retention policy having a motivating effect on teachers and students.“We think that people might see that line in the sand and want to get over it before they fall behind it,” Winters said. “If you have this line in third grade, then it might be the case that schools respond to that … by giving a lot more effort to students and maybe moving the best teachers in or maybe a more motivated focus on reading before the kids get to the third grade in the first place and face the probability of being retained.”Nevertheless, several large urban districts that had once routinely kept kids back are now rethinking their retention policies. New York mayor Bill de Blasio has argued that there should be more variables involved in student promotion than just standardized tests. In Chicago, the district slowly has been backing away from its splashy 1996 ban on social promotions. According to a 2004 report by the University of Chicago’s Consortium on Chicago School Research, Chicago’s retention rates dropped steadily after 1996 despite few gains in student performance; in 2000 the district increased the range at which a student could be promoted and increased waiver rates, allowing more students to pass through the promotional gates at third, sixth and eighth grade.“Every couple of years there’s change in terms of what the threshold is and what it’s based on,” said Elaine Allensworth, a director with the research group.Allensworth said there’s a lot of confusion over what’s actually best for students. She said politicians vilify social promotion without considering the consequences, which include social and emotional repercussions for students and decreases in the level of classroom instruction for the entire class.“I think people just don’t think it through, they’re looking for a very simplistic solution to a problem and not thinking about how that fits into the whole system,” Allensworth said.Los Angeles is using standardized tests and course assessments to monitor students in the intervention program. When asked to assess the success of the interventions, Galvez cited district reports on standardized test scores as evidence of improvement, although he acknowledged that district data shows test scores had been climbing before LAUSD beefed up the intervention program. State scores have generally been rising as well.“Success is measured by the number of students who received intervention and showed improvement,” Galvez said. “Analysis of district data indicate that the district intervention efforts, along with efforts to ensure high-quality (teaching) in math and reading, have impacted positively student achievement.”For Alberto Cortes, now 16, the solution was not simply to repeat a grade, but to find mentors and teachers who would take time with him and let him learn things his way -- in a flexible environment where he could learn at his own pace.A few months after he dropped out of high school, Cortes’ mother enrolled him in a Los Angeles County Office of Education alternative education program, which allowed him to meet one-on-one with a teacher at the El Nido Family Centers near his home.He is now caught up and plans to graduate within the next year and a half. Cortes, the baby of the family, will be the first of his mother’s three children to graduate from high school.“I do want to get at least my bachelor’s and my master’s,” Cortes said. “I want to do something in the medical business. But at (the time I dropped out) I always thought that I was going to end up in jail someday.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report."
