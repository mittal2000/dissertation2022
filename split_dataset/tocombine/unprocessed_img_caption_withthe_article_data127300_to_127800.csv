But in his Oscar acceptance speech for Best Actor last night, Matthew McConaughey took his thanks in a more unexpected direction. The Dallas Buyers Club star went so far as to say, “He has shown me that it’s a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates.""McConaughey's emotional speech made headlines across the Internet today, being described by different media outlets as both the best and worst speech of the night. New York Magazine wrote, ""dude got emotional, he got religious, he got downright philosophical."" But religion aside, it’s tough to deny the power of gratitude when an extensive body of research supports its health and well-being benefits. Taking a moment to be thankful for the good things in life can help you manage stress, sleep better, and maintain a healthy heart and immune system. Researchers at the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley have even commissioned a three-year project, Expanding the Science and Practice of Gratitude, to dig deeper into the health benefits behind the art of appreciation.

2,PARENTING,Is 'Let It Go' a Protest Song for the Toddler Set?,"Jill Herzig, Contributor

Some of their moms are singing along (despite a kerfuffle over Elsa's surprisingly sexy performance), mainly because it's impossible to get this tune out of your head.Don't get me wrong, it's a great song. I liked the movie. Idina Menzel has some serious pipes, as she will prove once again when she performs ""Let It Go"" at the Oscars on Sunday. But I worry that I'll have a hard time sitting through her big number, because if I hear that song one more time I might stick my head in the oven. My daughters sing it, my niece sings it, my friend's two sons sing it. A kid on the subway sang it at the top of her lungs on my 3 train the other day, all the way from Clark Street in Brooklyn to Times Square. Her father looked stricken and glassy-eyed. The song has been streamed 25 million times; the sheet music is sold out and on a three month backorder. It's the show-stopping climax of the sing-along version of Frozen, in theaters now. You have to ask yourself why ""Let it Go"" has imprinted so strongly on kids. Why is this hit bigger than other good ditties, like ""Under the Sea"" from The Little Mermaid or ""Be Our Guest"" from Beauty and the Beast? Here's my theory: It's a protest song for the under-12 set. They've had it up to here with our modern parenting methods in general, and our approach to discipline in particular. They don't want to sit under the ""peace tree"" or earn another good-behavior sticker on yet another chart, and they especially don't want to take a freaking time out. Just look at the lyrics of ""Let It Go"" and tell me Elsa isn't in a time out (aka a ""kingdom of isolation""), enraged and defiant and subverting the dynamic by embracing her exile. ""Let it go, let it go, Can't hold you back anymore. Let it go, let it go, Turn my back and slam the door. Here I stand, and here I'll stay. Let it go, let it go... The cold never bothered me anyway.""Like so many parents of my generation, I practiced the time-out as a sensitive, well-reasoned response to naughtiness. So much better than spanking, right? My dad used to spank me when I was really, really bad. It always went like this: He would get home from work, hear about my crime, set me up at the end of a hallway that ran the length of our apartment, and give me a good swat. Then I was free to run down what I always thought of as The Spanking Hall, screaming at the top of my lungs. But after that, it was over. I'd come back and everyone would sit together, a little red in the face, eating dinner. We all felt bad, but no one was banished. Just so we're clear, I'm not advocating a return to corporal punishment. But perhaps we're overusing the disciplinary alternatives in our quest to make sure our kids share, behave in restaurants, sit still at circle time and never go bonkers with a Sharpie. Should we give our kids a little more slack, before this songfest becomes a full-on revolt? Next time one of my daughters legitimately screws up, you know what I'm planning to do: [Sing it with me] Let it go."

The National Park Service marked the 50th anniversary of the closure of the notorius Alcatraz federal penitentiary with an exhibit of newly discovered photos by Los Angeles freelance photographer Leigh Wiener of the prison's final day in 1963. Alcatraz was first a fort and later became an Army disciplinary barracks before being taken over by the Bureau of Prisons in 1934.

Cornwell of Springfield, the book's publisher.Stroud entered federal prison in 1909 at age 19 after being convicted of manslaughter for killing with his bare hands a man in Alaska who allegedly beat up a prostitute. He spent the next 54 years in four different federal facilities.In 1916, Stroud knifed a guard to death at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, over a dispute about visiting privileges for Stroud's mother. He served the next 43 years in solitary confinement.Stroud began studying birds at Leavenworth and wrote two heralded scientific books on bird diseases, which led to a 1962 movie about his life called ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" starring Burt Lancaster.""Here is a guy with a third-grade education who somehow educated himself to write books on birds that were followed around the world,"" said his lawyer, Dudley Martin, 80. ""My father raised gamecocks and he used Stroud's book when they got sick."" PUBLISHERS WARYAfter his transfer to Alcatraz in 1942, Stroud turned his attention to researching the history of federal prisons and interviewing inmates and guards.""Nobody else had written this stuff and the federal prison system did not want it out,"" Martin said.Stroud spent years trying to get his book published, finally suing the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in 1962 to allow publication.But Stroud died in 1963 before the lawsuit was resolved. And it took 21 years for Martin, the administrator of Stroud's will, to get legal possession of the manuscripts from probate.Martin's secretary put Stroud's hand-written notebook manuscripts into type, more than 2,000 pages single-spaced. Martin sent the book to three New York publishers, all of whom turned it down, concerned about libel suits.The manuscripts went into storage at Martin's house in the mid-1980s. Some 30 years later, the people named in the book have died and the statute of limitations on libel has expired, Martin said.In the first volume, Stroud also reveals that he was gay, though he had married a woman while in prison who was his partner in a bird-related business on the outside.More of his writings are to come, with the volumes tracing the rise and degeneration of the prison reform movement and how sex in prison contributed to character destruction.Stroud spent the last four years of his life at the federal medical center prison in Springfield. Martin took over as his lawyer after Stroud's transfer from Alcatraz and met him only once, in court.""He was a great big, tall man,"" Martin said. ""I had to look up at him.""Martin said Stroud would be pleased to know the public is finally able to read his account of the prison system.""He'd be honored,"" Martin said. ""He would feel appreciated for what he had done."" (Editing by Gunna Dickson)"
