Seaman",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/truvada-gay-men-access_us_57800150e4b01edea78ddfc7,"Unequal use of Truvada may worsen the disparities between races in HIV rates, a study found.",2016-07-08,"Continuing to educate people about PrEP, changing the social stigma around its use and altering some of the public health approaches may help address some of the disparities. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578002291a000024006f94fb.jpeg?cache=B0GDGCf3sx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Only a small proportion of gay and bisexual men who could have taken a daily pill to reduce their risk of HIV actually did so in 2014, according to a new study.Furthermore, young gay and bisexual men and those of color, who are among the groups most at risk for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), were less likely to be taking the medication than their older and white counterparts.Unequal use of the drug, called Truvada, may worsen the disparities between races in HIV rates, said lead author Henry Raymond, of the San Francisco Department of Public Health.“We don’t want to leave anyone behind,” he told Reuters Health.Truvada, manufactured by Gilead, is a combination of two antiretroviral drugs that work to keep HIV, which causes AIDS, from replicating in the body. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2012, Truvada is often just referred to as PrEP, which stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis.Gay and bisexual men who regularly take Truvada reduce their risk of HIV by 90 percent, according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).For the new study, reported in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, Raymond’s team analyzed data from 411 gay and bisexual men living in San Francisco in 2014.About three-fourths of the men said they were HIV-negative - and of those, 64 percent met one of the CDC’s criteria for Truvada use. Those criteria are having an HIV-positive partner, not being in a monogamous relationship with an HIV-negative partner, having anal sex without a condom or having a sexually transmitted infection in the past six months.But while nearly two-thirds were eligible for Truvada, only about 14 percent of those eligible men said they had used it at some point in the past year.When the researchers applied the study’s results to the wider population of gay and bisexual men in San Francisco, they estimated that 27,745 men met the CDC’s guidelines for Truvada but weren’t using the drug.About 80 percent of young gay and bisexual men between ages 18 and 24 met one of those criteria, compared to about 29 percent of men 55 years old or older, the study found. Yet, none of the younger men reported using Truvada.About 23 percent of white gay and bisexual men who met the CDC’s criteria took the pill, compared to about 4 percent of Hispanic men, 7 percent of Asian men and 8 percent of black men, the researchers found.According to the CDC, 44,703 people in the U.S. were diagnosed with HIV in 2014 - and about 25 percent of new infections were in black gay and bisexual men. About 18 percent of those new cases were among gay and bisexual males ages 13 to 24.“There (are) pretty marked disparities in who is using and who is not using PrEP,” said Dr. John Schneider, who directs the Chicago Center for HIV Elimination at the University of Chicago.There could be several reason why certain people are less likely to use Truvada, he told Reuters Health, including structural factors like lack of insurance, incarceration rates and how often people see their doctors.The researchers caution that the study’s results are limited. For example, the data were collected only two years after Truvada was approved for PreP.Raymond also said the results may not reflect Truvada use in other parts of the U.S.Schneider, who was not involved with the new study, also cautioned that the CDC’s criteria for PrEP use may not be applicable to all gay and bisexual men.“From our data (on) black men who have sex with men who turned HIV-positive, half of those guys were not eligible for PrEP by the CDC guidelines, which means the CDC guidelines may be missing the most vulnerable men,” he said.Continuing to educate people about PrEP, changing the social stigma around its use and altering some of the public health approaches may help address some of the disparities, said Schneider.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/29z0c7S Sexually Transmitted Infections, online June 28, 2016."

He called Trump a “deranged f**k” last month for his comments following the Orlando nightclub shooting.But in Friday’s podcast, Noah tried to look on the bright side by acknowledging the continuous flow of material he has thanks to Trump’s outlandish comments.“Every single day, we sit in the office and we say, ‘Donald Trump surely, surely cannot say anything crazier than this,’” Noah said. “And every day he says something that shocks us. I don’t know how he does it. He’s a force of nature and you have to commend him for that.”Not all the guests featured on the podcast were as amused. Stuart Stevens, former campaign strategist for 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, said he’s been a skeptic of Trump’s campaign since the beginning.“I don’t think he’s going to be on the ballot by Feb. 1,” Stevens told CNN’s Jake Tapper last October.Like many others, Stevens got that wrong, but he still doubts Trump will win in November. “He can’t argue a case in five logical sentences,” Stevens said on Friday. “I think he’s going to go down to historic defeat.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

The votes didn’t happen.Here, we highlight 10 deadly shootings that have happened since the 26-hour protest in the House. These shootings weren’t accidents or acts of self-defense, and they didn’t involve police. These were acts of violence committed by people with bad intentions and access to guns. On June 24, Christy Sheats reportedly called a family meeting before shooting her two daughters ― Taylor, 22, and Madison, 17 ― inside their Texas home. She then finished the fatal attack in the street, according to authorities. Police later fatally shot Sheats.Two people were killed in late June when a shooting broke out during an unauthorized party at a dance studio in Fort Worth, Texas. The victims were identified as Treavon Lewis, 22, and Jordan Larkin, 18.In another incident late last month, 47-year-old Salomon Diaz ― reportedly enraged by the decision reached at a custody hearing in Navajo County, Arizona ― fatally shot the children’s mother, 25-year-old Ashley Utley, and maternal grandmother, 45-year-old Sherry Quintero-Davenport.Mickey Russell allegedly fired a gun at his wife, Cara Russell, multiple times in a Denver office building on June 28.

Yousef was shot in the head during the attack. Martha Ligon reportedly began following a random car on July 1. Authorities say she began shooting at random people when the vehicle reached its destination in Carlisle County, Kentucky.

He was hit and killed.Three or four men reportedly opened fire at an Independence Day block party near downtown Houston, killing three people. Witnesses said one of the deaths may have been a revenge killing.Jennifer Brewer Rooney, a 44-year-old newspaper deliverywoman in Bristol, Tennessee, was shot and killed on the job this week. Her car crashed through a chain link fence. A suspect was shot during the incident, police said, and later apprehended.These cases represent just a fraction of the fatal shootings that have taken place recently in the U.S. ― where guns kill an estimated 36 people every day.

5,BLACK VOICES,Friends And Family Remember Alton Sterling As The Most Generous Man In The Neighborhood,Lydia O'Connor and David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alton-sterling-remembered_us_577ed34ce4b0c590f7e8af63,“You’re not going to hear one bad thing about that man out here.”,2016-07-08,"Alton Sterling, 37, was killed by police on Tuesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577ef2311b00002700f6ca70.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BATON ROUGE, La. ― Alton Sterling, 37, was a loving father of five who worked hard to earn a living, loved to joke and laugh, and was generous to a fault no matter what his own financial circumstances were, friends and family say.On Tuesday, he became the 135th black person killed by police in 2016.“We demand justice and we’re not going to stop until we get justice,” his aunt, Vda Wanesta Abusalah, said outside the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, convenience store where police shot him multiple times in the chest and back. The police were responding to a complaint about an armed man threatening people outside the store, though eyewitness accounts and video do not show Sterling holding a gun or resisting arrest. Sterling sold CDs outside the store for $5 each, but often gave them away to people who couldn’t afford them, people outside the store told The Huffington Post.“He would have gave you the shirt off his back,” his close friend Shameka Brown, 30, said. “You’re not going to hear one bad thing about that man out here.”She said she was one of the first people protesting his death outside the store, where hundreds have since gathered to demand justice. “He’d give you anything,” his aunt continued. “Let me tell you something. Every house ― just about every house Alton had ― they evicted him out of it. You know why they evicted him? Because he was getting people off the streets to live in his house.”The store owner, Abdullah Muflahi, said Sterling would come in to buy drinks for people who didn’t have enough money to purchase their own. “If you was thirsty, he would give it to you,” another friend, Erica Alexander, said. She had just bought a CD from him an hour before he was killed. “He touched our neighborhood,” his friend Sheerick Brown said. “He touched everybody around here.”In addition to his gig as “the CD man,” as many knew him, Sterling sometimes worked as a part-time cook and loved to make red beans and rice, friends say. For the past few months, he’d been living at a shelter called the Living Waters Outreach Ministries.“He wasn’t out there robbing and stealing,” his aunt said. “He sat in this hot-ass sun selling CDs, $5 a CD. You know how long it took him to make a damn $100? He didn’t care. He didn’t give up. He was persistent and this was his living. That’s the type of person he was.”Sterling had a hard time finding regular work because of his prior criminal record, friends said. Mally Mall, 28, from New Orleans, pointed out the difficulty of expecting a person who did “five or 10 years” in prison to thrive after being sent back out “on the streets.”“How could he cope?” he asked. “What could he do to make money when he need food, he need clothes, he need this and that?” Mall met Sterling when they were incarcerated together, and he sometimes purchased CDs from him to support him. “Seeing him do a positive thing motivated me to want to work and get a job and not come out here and get caught up in a wrong,” he said.Friends said Sterling had just recently started carrying a gun because a friend of his who also sold CDs had just been robbed.“I understand he’s a convicted felon and he’s not supposed to have a gun, but you gotta understand, the police say they’re protecting us but at the same time we have to protect ourselves too,” Mall said. Those who knew and loved Sterling want the officers involved to be held accountable for their actions.“We don’t want Alton’s death to be in vain,” his neighbor Ivy Early Thomas, 62, said. “We want justice for Alton,” she continued. “And the police officers on the video that we saw … they murdered him and we want justice for him right now.”If the officers involved in Sterling’s death are punished, it would be a change in a disturbing trend. Prosecutors are usually reluctant to bring charges against police officers, and in many of the high-profile cases involving cops taking the lives of black men, grand juries choose not indict them.“He’s not the first one to be killed. It’s been going on for years and years and years,” Brown said of Sterling. “Us as a community ― white, blacks, Hispanics, everybody ― need to be out here protesting. That’s all I have to say.”"

Three men ― a 55-year-old identified only by his initials of P.G.O., a 23-year-old Californian identified only as W.R.O. and J.G.O., a 46-year-old from Pensacola, Florida ― were gored during the Friday morning event. Their condition is currently described as “less severe.” Two other U.S. nationals, who were reportedly not gored, suffered minor injuries. Officials identified them as a 26-year-old man, H.T.O., and a 53-year-old woman, S.C.O.All were admitted to the Hospital of Navarra.Organizers described the run, in which at least seven people were gored, as “crazy.”A 58-year-old man from Pamplona and a 73-year-old man from South Africa were admitted to the hospital with serious injuries. Manuel Monestino, the hospital’s deputy director, told Reuters that one man had been gored in the chest and the other in the belly. A 26-year-old Indian man and a 48-year-old Canadian man were also gored less seriously, according to officials.Friday’s run followed a relatively calm first run on Thursday, in which four people were hospitalized but no one was gored. Six bulls weighing up to 1,400 pounds each run through the city’s streets every morning during the festival, which takes place from July 6-14. Dozens of bulls die during the festival, which is condemned by animal rights activists.Some 37 people were hospitalized during last year’s festival, and 15 people have been killed since records on the festival started being kept in 1910.This story was updated after reports emerged that additional people were injured in the festival."

On average, 40,000 tons of food are thrown away daily.Brazil’s problem is part of a global food loss and waste problem. Worldwide, more than 1 billion tons of food goes to waste every year. At the same time, there are 870 million hungry people around the globe.International organizations, civil society groups, governments, private sector companies and entrepreneurs have been ramping up projects that address food loss and work toward waste reduction. One such initiative is the São Paulo-based “Invisible Food” project, which seeks to reduce food waste in the city by extending the lifetime of food products.The founders, Daniela Leite, Flávia Vendramin and Sergio Ignacio are committed to raising awareness about food waste in their city. The initiative has submitted a bill (PL 581-2015) to city councilman Ricardo Young, that if implemented would require companies to donate food products that may have lost their commercial value, but are still suitable for consumption. The bill, which is currently under review by the city council, would also prohibit viable food from being discarded in landfills. Leite, Vendramin and Ignacio also plan to set up a food truck that would serve meals made from recipes that make the most out of “invisible” food, or products that are traditionally wasted. To set an example for the full reutilization of food, the truck will use ingredients donated by tradesmen from the Sao Paulo General Warehousing and Centers Company, as well as partner supermarkets.The trio says that the profit from the food truck will be reinvested in projects to promote food waste awareness campaigns.“Besides feeding people, the ‘Invisible Food’ initiative intends to bring awareness and information to the population, and recover lost food,” the founders explain. Did you know that Brazil throws away 15 million tons of food every year?! We want to change that, so we have launched a crowdfunding campaign to set up a food truck of invisible food. The idea is to bring to the population information about how to fight food waste.

That’s part and parcel of any development program,” said Greening.When asked if DFID was planning to help charities with losses of EU funding, Greening said it was important that charities, government agencies and philanthropic institutions work together.“We’re now on this path of a UK of the future that is going to be coming out of the EU,” she said.“I think everybody has to adapt to what will be a new future for our country, but critically the key to success in development is working together in partnership”.She said development challenges including girls’ lack of access to education “will still be there whatever’s happening domestically in the UK - whilst ever we’re going through our Brexit and re-negotiation”.“Putting them on our agenda, that’s not just the right thing to do for tackling poverty, actually it’s part of how we make sure Britain is a successful country in the future,” she said.($1 = 0.7755 pounds)(Reporting by Matthew Ponsford, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, traficking, property rights and climate change.

Orangutans ― one of the planet’s most intelligent animals ― are officially headed for extinction.The Bornean orangutan is now critically endangered, according to a species assessment published this week by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The animal's Sumatran cousin, the other species of orangutan, was already listed as critically endangered ― meaning all orangutans are now at “extremely high risk of extinction in the wild,” IUCN said.“This is full acknowledgement of what has been clear for a long time: Orangutan conservation is failing,” Andrew Marshall, one of the assessment’s authors, told Mongabay this week. In 2015, conservationist Richard Zimmerman recalled the story of Kesi, an infant Bornean orangutan. Rescue workers discovered Kesi in 2006 on the island of Borneo. She was just 3 months old then then, tiny and fragile ― and she was missing a hand.Zimmerman believes the infant and her mom encountered humans after their forest home was destroyed to make way for a palm oil plantation. After killing the mother ape, they hacked off the baby’s hand.“Infant orangutans, who ride on their mothers’ stomachs by holding onto their long hair, have incredibly strong grips. They do not let go,” Zimmerman, whose organization Orangutan Outreach helps facilitate the rescue and rehabilitation of wild orangutans, told The Huffington Post last year. “The baby’s hand was chopped off — most likely to pry her off her mother.”Following her rescue, Kesi was successfully rehabilitated. She’s grown into a “strong, dominant female who doesn’t let a missing hand stop her from doing anything,” said Zimmerman. She will one day be released back into the wild.But Kesi is one of the lucky ones.According to the IUCN, Bornean orangutan populations have decreased by nearly two-thirds since the early 1970s, and will further decline to an estimated 47,000 animals by 2025. This would represent a decline of more than 86 percent in 75 years, the group said. Sumatran orangutan populations have also decreased dramatically in the past century. There are fewer than 7,300 individuals from the species left in the wild today. Orangutans live exclusively on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and the island of Borneo, which is shared between Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. Experts have pinpointed the destruction of Sumatran and Bornean rainforests in order to produce palm oil as one of the greatest threats to orangutan survival. The widely used commodity is the top cause of forest loss in Indonesia, accounting for 75 percent of deforestation in some areas of Borneo, according to a 2013 Greenpeace study.The forests of Indonesia and Malaysia are projected to disappear completely in 20 years if deforestation is not curbed.“Orangutans are specialists at living in the forest,” said Robert Shumaker, the Indianapolis Zoo’s vice president of conservation and life sciences. “Without a healthy forest, they simply can’t survive. Generally, orangutans that are displaced and driven out of their home range during the deforestation process have no future and will likely die as a result of their habitat being destroyed.”Hunting, said the IUCN, is another major threat to orangutan populations.An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 Bornean orangutans have been killed every year for the past four decades, primarily for their meat, the Associated Press reported.“If hunting does not stop, all populations that are hunted will decline, irrespective of what happens to their habitat. These findings confirm that habitat protection alone will not ensure the survival of orangutans,” IUCN said. Orangutans are also slow breeders, making these threats even more grievous. “Females only breed once every 7-8 years, so losing an individual, let alone several, can be catastrophic for a population,” Zimmerman said.Though the orangutans’ future appears hopelessly grim, extinction is not necessarily a “foregone conclusion,” stressed Marshall of the IUCN.Orangutans are adaptable, he noted. And efforts made by governments and corporations to curb deforestation could have a major impact on the health of forests in Sumatra and Borneo.“Although I think things will likely get worse before they get better,” Marshall told Mongabay, “it’s not too late for orangutans.”"

Messenger is a separate service from Facebook’s core app and website that allows people to have private conversations with their friends. It’s accessible via a smartphone app or on Messenger.com.“We put people first in everything we do at Messenger, and today we are beginning to roll out a new option within Messenger to better support conversations about sensitive topics,” Facebook said in a blog post.The language is familiar for the social media giant, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly stated that the company’s goal is to “connect the world.”That mission is sometimes complicated. Just this week, the company had a sloppy response to a live video recorded and published via the Facebook app that showed the aftermath of a fatal police-involved shooting in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota. And its WhatsApp messaging service ― which uses the same type of encryption that’s now being introduced to Messenger ― has been used by the self-described Islamic State to traffic sex slaves.Many tech companies, including Apple, have introduced end-to-end encryption to users in a bid to guarantee privacy, a growing concern for many. Whether that’s appropriate is up for debate, with some people arguing that law enforcement groups should be able to access the communications of criminal suspects. Messenger’s encryption will be optional. That’s because part of the platform’s appeal is that you can use it across devices. Enabling “secret conversations,” as Facebook puts it, will limit those conversations to a single device because of how the technology works.Some users are able to beta test the encryption feature now, but most will get it later this summer, Facebook said."

It allows license holders 21 and older to bring handguns into classrooms and buildings throughout the University of Texas system, one of the nation’s largest, with an enrollment of more than 214,000 students.“Compelling professors at a public university to allow, without any limitation or restriction, students to carry concealed guns in their classrooms chills their First Amendment rights to academic freedom,” according to the lawsuit, whose defendants include the state’s attorney general, the school’s president and university’s board of regents.The professors argue that they discuss controversial and emotionally laden subjects such as reproductive rights and it would be inevitable for them to pull back at important junctures because of a cloud of gun violence hanging over the classroom.University officials said they were reviewing the lawsuit and typically do not comment on pending litigation. Earlier this year, university President Greg Fenves reluctantly approved plans for holders of concealed handguns to bring pistols into classrooms, saying he had been forced to by the Republican-backed law.The office of Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, was not immediately available for comment but has said the law protects the rights of gun owners.Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, has said the law could prevent mass shootings because someone with a licensed concealed weapon could confront a gunman.The so-called “campus carry” law allows private colleges to opt out and most of the state’s best-known private universities have done so, saying the law runs counter to protecting student safety.Eight states now have provisions allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on public post-secondary campuses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks state laws.The Texas law takes effect on the 50th anniversary of one of the deadliest U.S. gun incidents on a U.S. college campus: student Charles Whitman killed 16 people by firing from a perch atop the clock tower at the University of Texas at Austin."

One of the protesters, who was near the scene, shed light on an issue that has been largely overlooked in the rhetoric surrounding the shooting ― the challenges faced by formerly incarcerated individuals. The man, who goes by Mally Mall, told The Huffington Post’s David Lohr he was once incarcerated with Sterling. He said that society had failed Sterling, who sold CDs and had been living in a shelter for the past few months, long before he was killed at the hands of police. Sterling’s predicament illustrates the difficulty of reintegrating into society and finding a job after incarceration, he said. “Y’all send us home from jail [and] tell us to get a job, knowing that every application they have say, if you’re a convicted felon, then we can’t work. So then we try to sell CDs, try to sell a few little item[s] just to make it,” he said. “Even when we get jobs, we still get judged as criminals.” He added that Sterling’s efforts to earn an “honest living” inspired him to get a job and “not get caught up in the wrong.”Sterling, a 37-year-old black man, was selling CDs outside of a Baton Rouge convenience store before he was killed early Tuesday morning. The altercation was captured on video and has since gone viral, helping to propel the tragic story into the national spotlight. While the Department of Justice, the FBI’s New Orleans Division and the United States Attorney’s Office in Baton Rouge are all investigating the high-profile shooting, Larry Billins, a 54-year-old Baton Rouge resident, said he isn’t optimistic about the outcome of the inquiry. “I wouldn’t be surprised if [the police involved] didn’t [face any consequences] because it’s done happened so many times,” he said. “But as long as we let it happen, they’re going to keep on doing it. We’ve got to put this thing to a stop today.”This video was produced by Gemma Sapwell, edited by Zachary Chapman and shot by David Lohr. "

His girlfriend filmed a graphic video, using Facebook Live, that shows Castile bleeding from his wounds. The officer, who has not been identified, “shot him three times because we had a busted tail light,” the girlfriend can be heard saying.Sterling, a 37-year-old father of five, was killed by Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II on Tuesday morning. The two officers were responding to reports of a man carrying a gun, threatening others and selling CDs in front of a Triple S convenience store.On Thursday, Gutiérrez put those two deaths in the broader context of black people being killed by police. He alluded to the 2014 shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in Chicago and the 2015 deaths of 25-year-old Freddie Gray in Baltimore and 50-year-old Walter Scott in Charleston, South Carolina.This year, at least 136 black people have been killed by police, according to a Guardian project that tracks such deaths in the U.S. Gutiérrez went on:But we know it is everywhere. Chicago, Baltimore, South Carolina ― it seems that every week or month another black man is shot by police and we always have the same reaction.The congressmen said he’d cried watching Castile’s mother Thursday morning on CNN as she defended her son’s dignity against the racist stereotypes of black men: She said he has a job. He served children in a cafeteria. He was calm.“This is another sad chapter in American history,” Gutiérrez said.That is true. Race often prompts police violence ― as Jack Glaser, an associate professor at the University of California-Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy, pointed out to The Huffington Post last year. The roots of modern policing in America can be traced, in part, to the patrols that once hunted escaped slaves.Gutiérrez lamented that there is “no national strategy and no national conversation” on police violence and then slammed the congressional hearings on Hillary Clinton’s email server, the Benghazi attacks and defunding Planned Parenthood. “When Americans are literally crying out in the streets that, yes, in fact, black lives matter, we have no response from this Congress, the people’s house. None,” he said. “Young men are shot by police, videotapes are withheld from the public, and nothing happens,” Gutiérrez added. The congressman ended his speech by once again calling on Congress to step up and do something about police killings. ”Mr. Speaker,” Gutiérrez said, “this Congress needs to come together and lead. And we need to start right now.” "

The two officers were responding to reports of a man carrying a gun, threatening others and selling CDs in front of a Triple S convenience store.On Thursday, Gutiérrez put those two deaths in the broader context of black people being killed by police. He alluded to the 2014 shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in Chicago and the 2015 deaths of 25-year-old Freddie Gray in Baltimore and 50-year-old Walter Scott in Charleston, South Carolina.This year, at least 136 black people have been killed by police, according to a Guardian project that tracks such deaths in the U.S. Gutiérrez went on:But we know it is everywhere. Chicago, Baltimore, South Carolina ― it seems that every week or month another black man is shot by police and we always have the same reaction.The congressmen said he’d cried watching Castile’s mother Thursday morning on CNN as she defended her son’s dignity against the racist stereotypes of black men: She said he has a job. He served children in a cafeteria. He was calm.“This is another sad chapter in American history,” Gutiérrez said.That is true. Race often prompts police violence ― as Jack Glaser, an associate professor at the University of California-Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy, pointed out to The Huffington Post last year. The roots of modern policing in America can be traced, in part, to the patrols that once hunted escaped slaves.Gutiérrez lamented that there is “no national strategy and no national conversation” on police violence and then slammed the congressional hearings on Hillary Clinton’s email server, the Benghazi attacks and defunding Planned Parenthood. “When Americans are literally crying out in the streets that, yes, in fact, black lives matter, we have no response from this Congress, the people’s house. None,” he said. “Young men are shot by police, videotapes are withheld from the public, and nothing happens,” Gutiérrez added. The congressman ended his speech by once again calling on Congress to step up and do something about police killings. ”Mr. Speaker,” Gutiérrez said, “this Congress needs to come together and lead. And we need to start right now.” "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) will speak at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland later this month at the invitation of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, but the two former rivals did not come to any conclusion about an endorsement from Cruz ― at least not yet.“We had a positive and productive meeting this morning with Donald Trump,” Cruz told reporters after huddling privately with Trump in Washington on Thursday. “There was no discussion of any endorsement. He asked me if I would speak at the convention and I said I’d be very glad to do so.”In a separate statement issued following the meeting, a spokeswoman for the senator said that Trump asked Cruz “for his counsel on future judicial nomination, and Cruz responded he would continue to do everything he can to help ensure principled constitutionalists on the courts.”The conservative senator from Texas mounted the biggest primary challenge to Trump, garnering 559 delegates and more than 7.6 million votes. The race between the two men turned quite personal, however, after Trump disparaged the appearance of Cruz’s wife, Heidi, and suggested that Cruz’s father, Rafael, was involved with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.Amanda Carpenter, a former Cruz campaign aide who now works at CNN, weighed in with her thoughts regarding the peculiar arrangement on Twitter.Cruz isn’t the only former 2016 rival planning to make an appearance at the convention. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) confirmed this week he would be attending the event. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), however, is skipping the convention to focus on his re-election.Trump tweeted about his meetings with Republicans earlier Thursday.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Sen. Marco Rubio would be attending the convention.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is expected to formally endorse presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, potentially ending tensions between the two and easing the concerns of party leaders hoping for a united front ahead of the nominating convention later this month.The endorsement is expected to occur next Tuesday, when Sanders and Clinton will appear together at a rally in New Hampshire, Democratic sources first told NBC News on Wednesday.Sanders all but confirmed that he would endorse Clinton in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday.“We have got to do everything that we can to defeat Donald Trump and elect Hillary Clinton,” he said, adding that “I don’t honestly know how we would survive four years of a Donald Trump [as president].”After repeatedly pledging to continue his campaign until the convention, the Vermont senator has appeared increasingly open to backing Clinton in recent weeks.He affirmed in June that he would vote for Clinton, and promised to “do everything I can to defeat” presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. But his campaign insisted Sanders didn’t mean the comments as a formal endorsement of Clinton. Chief among Sanders’ concerns was whether Clinton and the Democratic Party would embrace the progressive policy agenda that was central to his presidential campaign. While he succeeded in getting some of his policy proposals into the party’s platform, which will be adopted at the convention, Sanders said that he would continue his fight.“I hope very much that Secretary Clinton understands that not only is it good public policy, it’s the right thing to do,” he said in June. “It is good politics to begin to move in that direction.”Vice President Joe Biden foreshadowed Sanders’ eventual endorsement, telling NPR on June 30 that Sanders had told him he’d back Clinton.Sanders, however, told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes later that evening that he had met with Biden “about three weeks ago,” and stressed that he was not prepared to endorse Clinton yet.“My hope is that we can reach an agreement on some very important issues, and I can go forward to the millions of people who supported me and say, ‘Look, this is the progress we’ve made. This is where we’re going to go as a country,’” Sanders said. “So I hope it happens. As of this moment, we’re not there quite yet.”Sanders’ pending endorsement caps a prolonged primary campaign during which Sanders and his supporters often ruffled feathers, accusing Democratic officials of rigging the primary process in favor of Clinton. The party scheduled several of the debates on weekends, when voters were less likely to watch.Sanders acknowledged that some of his supporters may have gone too far in May, when they unleashed violent attacks during protests of the party’s delegate system.In early June, after Clinton reached the number of delegates required to win the nomination, Sanders pledged to continue his campaign, and shifted his focus to demanding reforms within the party and advocating for Clinton to adopt more progressive policy positions."

It has also been linked to Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that can cause temporary paralysis in adults.The study, which hopes to enroll at least 1,000 subjects, is being led by Dr. Carrie Byington of the University of Utah, who earlier this year began a pilot study of 150 participants, a third of whom said they or their partner planned to become pregnant within a year of the Olympics. They will be included in the larger study.“We will follow individuals who have exposure to Zika virus for up to two years,” Byington said via email. “Because the cohort is anticipated to include primarily individuals in their reproductive years, we will be able to study reproductive health outcomes, including pregnancy outcomes.”The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which has now confirmed more than 1,600 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zikainfections in the mothers.Zika is the first known mosquito-borne virus that can also be transmitted via unprotected sex with an infected male partner, leading to imprecise recommendations of how long couples should abstain or refrain from unprotected sex if the woman is pregnant or hoping to become pregnant.Study participants will provide samples of bodily fluids to be tested for Zika and related viruses, such as dengue, which will help identify people who are infected but asymptomatic. As many as 80 percent of those who contract Zika do not display the classic symptoms, such as fever, rash and red eyes, researchers have said.The U.S. Olympic study could help answer some of the big unknowns surrounding Zika, particularly the relative risks of asymptomatic versus symptomatic infections, and how long the virus remains present and transmittable in semen.“We hope to identify risk factors and protective measures that may help other travelers avoid infection,” Byington said.The USOC had previous said it will provide several months worth of condoms to its athletes and staff heading to Brazil for the games.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Bernard Orr)"

It, like the previous eight probes of the 2012 terrorist attacks in Libya, found no wrongdoing on the part of U.S. officials, although it did echo the previous works in saying the response to the assaults had significant flaws.Even its release was marred by partisan gamesmanship, with the committee’s GOP leadership selectively giving it to reporters who were not allowed to reach out to Democrats for comment.Democrats didn’t get copies until shortly before it was released widely. And now they can’t raise objections to the report publicly as it’s wrapped up.The final work of the committee is being done behind closed doors likely because parts of the report are classified. Other committees in such situations often debate the non-classified parts in public, then move to a closed session. But the lack of any effort to let the public see the final stages of the controversial committee led Democrats to hammer the move.“It’s no surprise that Benghazi Committee Republicans are choosing to take their final vote tomorrow behind closed doors, with no transparency and where no one can fact check their claims,” Democratic Whip Rep Sten Hoyer (Md.) told The Huffington Post.“That’s how they’ve operated since day one ― not sharing information with committee Democrats and concealing the truth from the public,” Hoyer said. “It reveals what everyone has known since the beginning and what [Majority Leader Kevin] McCarthy admitted: that the Benghazi Committee’s purpose is political, not investigative.”Hoyer was referring to McCarthy’s comment to Fox News that the committee work had damaged the presidential prospects of Hillary Clinton.The Republicans on the committee saw it differently, and pointed to the words of Dorothy Woods, the widow of Tyrone Woods, who was among the four Americans slain that night. He had tried to protect the facility from attackers.The widow vigorously defended the committee’s extended work in a CNN interview, saying critics have been unfair and that no one has “the right to tell me it’s time to move on. They’re not in my shoes.“I think that that’s the essence of what they have done, is they’ve been dismissive. The committee’s been ridiculed. The committee has been, they’ve been criticized,” Woods said. “And for them to sincerely do the right thing, to care about Americans, that’s what’s important.”The committee has lasted more than two years, making it one of the longer probes in congressional history. It has cost more than $7 million, and Democrats estimate that the price tag is closer to $20 million when the costs to the many responding federal agencies are counted."

Y’all don’t ever want to point at someone else and say, ‘You can’t do your job well,’” he said. “Police officers never want to say when y’all do a bad job.”“So that’s the reason the public thinks all of you are bad, because you won’t ever call someone out and say they murdered someone in cold blood, it happened again.”Rosenberg continued, urging officers to “lead the movement instead.”“How about instead of people rioting, police officers get out in front of it themselves, and you guys are the first ones on the front lines? That’s what should happen.”As Vox notes, the officer’s reluctance to criticize one of his brethren points to what’s known as the “blue wall of silence.” Such an unwritten code among law enforcement has long been linked to cops failing to comment on the unethical actions of others out of fear of being labeled a snitch.This tendency has largely held true as many high-profile cases have come to light in the last few years of law enforcement officers killing black men in America.Following a multimillion-dollar settlement awarded to the family of Eric Garner, a Staten Island man killed by New York police, the president of a New York police union called the payout “obscene” and “shameful.” Another union in Ferguson, Missouri, declared the anniversary of 18-year-old Michael Brown’s shooting “Darren Wilson Day,” in honor of the cop who killed him.A recent Gallup poll found the public’s trust in police is at its lowest level in 22 years.Multiple videos of Tuesday’s shooting of Sterling have emerged, including a clip that appears to show the man was unarmed. However, the Baton Rouge police department has provided little detail about the incident, continuing to say Sterling had a gun at the time of the shooting and calling his death a “horrible tragedy.”“Instead of you struggling to say, ‘Well, I don’t know, it could be…’ ― They murdered that man. We just saw it,” Rosenberg said on his show Wednesday."
30,TECH,Damning Essay Shames Tech Industry For Not Caring About Black People,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tech-industry-black-people_us_577e8e88e4b0c590f7e85659,Diversity reports aren’t enough.,2016-07-07,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is seen in 2012 with employees in Menlo Park, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577e93a11a00002600dd0074.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear Silicon Valley: You’d have more success recruiting black people if you actually supported the black community.That’s one powerful takeaway of a damning essay titled “Silicon Valley doesn’t care about black people,” published Wednesday night on Medium after the news broke that yet another black man, Philando Castile, had been killed by police in Minnesota ― barely two days after police fatally shot Anton Sterling, also black, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.In recent years, tech companies have issued report after report acknowledging that very few people of color work in Silicon Valley, and pledging to do better. More than a few tech CEOs are out there talking about how eager they are to recruit more men and women of color.But when black people are gunned down by police in the United States, these companies tend to stay silent, Justin Edmund, a former product designer at Pinterest, wrote Wednesday.“It stands out just how mute Silicon Valley is when it comes to unarmed black people being shot and killed by cops,” Edmund wrote. “It’s alarming, considering this very same industry is actively trying to court underrepresented minorities for technical positions to make their workforce diversity statistics look less homogeneously white.”Indeed, on Thursday Facebook was criticized for removing a video posted by Diamond Reynolds, Castile’s girlfriend. Facebook later reposted the video with a graphic content warning, but didn’t offer much of an explanation for the whole thing.Edmund called out Silicon Valley not just because of the industry’s supposed commitment to diversity, but because when these companies take a stand on an issue, they tend to have an effect.Consider the way companies like PayPal, Apple and Salesforce have been outspoken about LGBTQ rights. Not only have chief executives like Apple’s Tim Cook and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff made forceful statements supporting equality, but some of these companies have also pulled their business from states with discriminatory laws.In Indiana, a group of tech companies successfully pushed to get a law repealed that had permitted discrimination against gay people.“Silicon Valley was, as far as I know, one of the first industries to treat LGBTQ individuals like people, and look how far we’ve come on that front,” Edmund writes.However muted the tech industry has been on police violence, it’s played a pivotal role in at least one way: Technology has been absolutely critical in exposing police brutality to the world. After police shot Castile in a suburb of St. Paul on Wednesday, Reynolds filmed a graphic video of the aftermath and posted it on Facebook Live. When a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown in 2014, the world watched videos of the subsequent protests in Ferguson, Missouri ― and the heavily militarized police response ― via Vine videos on Twitter. (Disclosure: The Huffington Post is one of several brands that Facebook pays to broadcast live video content via the social network.)And of course, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained widespread amplification on Twitter, a critical platform for the black community. At the same time, only 2 percent of Twitter employees are actually black.On Thursday, several influential people in the tech world shared Edmund’s post. Anil Dash, a tech entrepreneur based in New York, took it one step further, noting that certain companies are essentially profiting from police violence as people use their products and services to document instances of brutality.GoPro and Nest Labs, which acquired Dropcam in 2014, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment for this article. But let’s hope executives throughout Silicon Valley are paying attention.UPDATE: In a Facebook post on Thursday night, Mark Zuckerberg offered his condolences to the Castile family and said this week’s police shooting videos “shine a light on the fear that millions of members of our community live with every day.” “While I hope we never have to see another video like Diamond’s,” he added, “it reminds us why coming together to build a more open and connected world is so important ― and how far we still have to go.“"

Gender identity is not explicitly covered by the law, but a number of courts and the federal government have interpreted it to include it ― including a recent ruling in favor of a trans student who was denied bathroom access by his high school.In a sense, the litigation spearheaded by Texas is a pushback against these developments in the law, premised on the notion that it should be up to Congress, and not the courts or the federal bureaucracy, to clarify whether gender identity should also be covered by the law.In the absence of that, the states argued, the Obama administration should have called for the views of the public using established administrative channels ― not just issued regulatory guidance that subjects schools to loss of federal funds or local businesses to potential liability. The Obama administration and its agencies “demand that men and women, boys and girls, have access to restrooms or other intimate facilities that match their ‘gender identity,’ not their biological sex,” lawyers for the states wrote in their Wednesday motion, which also seeks a ruling before the start of the school year. “Defendants’ actions are unlawful.”Because the government’s reading of the law applies nationally, Texas and the other states ― which include Alabama, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Arizona, Maine, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Utah, Georgia, Mississippi and Kentucky ― asked the court for a “nationwide” order barring its enforcement.That’s a major form of relief, similar in scope to the one Texas sought and obtained in its lawsuit against President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration, which the Supreme Court left on hold after failing to reach a majority on whether they’re legal.On this new action, Texas and its allies seem to be going for a similar strategy. And given the stakes in the controversy, it wouldn’t be surprising if the issue ends up reaching the high court.“The nation’s schools, and every place of employment, are now in the crosshairs of the Obama administration, which maintains it will punish those who do not comply with its orders,” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) in a statement."
32,POLITICS,Mr. Trump Goes To Washington,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-meetings-capitol-hill_us_577e8ff0e4b0c590f7e8595d,He's pivoting! (But not really.),2016-07-07,"By most accounts, Donald Trump failed to sway his biggest critics when he met with Republicans in Washington on Thursday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577ea6b11b00002700f6c8fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Thursday was a typical day for Donald Trump. In one meeting, Republicans seemed to think the presumptive GOP nominee was finally acting more presidential ― pivoting! ― and taking strides to unify the party. Then, just minutes later, Trump was back to his old belligerent self, attacking Senate Republicans who had not yet endorsed him.He started the day in a meeting with House Republicans, where, by most accounts, the mood was positive. Trump spoke about supporting Republican ideals, picking Supreme Court justices from a Heritage Foundation-approved list, even softening on some of the rhetoric that has concerned many in the GOP (namely, his anti-trade positions).Most Republicans ― or at least the ones who came into the meeting already supporting Trump ― left the gathering at the Capitol Hill Club saying he had taken a step forward.And then, in a meeting with Senate Republicans, it was two steps back.According to The Washington Post, when Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) got up to ask the presumptive GOP presidential nominee a question, Trump reportedly said, “You’ve been very critical of me.”“Yes, I’m the other senator from Arizona — the one who didn’t get captured — and I want to talk to you about statements like that,” Flake responded, according to two Republican officials.A source familiar with the Senate meeting said Trump was also critical of Sen. Mark Kirk, characterizing the Illinois Republican who was not in attendance as a loser. (Kirk withdrew his endorsement of Trump almost exactly a month ago.)He also reportedly had an exchange with Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who’s been one of the leaders of the so-called Never Trump movement. Sasse’s spokesman, James Wegmann, told The Huffington Post the senator’s position was unchanged after the meeting. “This election remains a dumpster fire,” Wegmann said.But the back-and-forth between Sasse and Trump was actually less of an exchange and more of Trump just talking in Sasse’s direction, the source told HuffPost.According to the source, Trump said that those who didn’t support him for president must be supporting presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump also reportedly claimed to have knowledge of Clinton’s Supreme Court nominees, saying he knew for a fact they’d be younger and more liberal than anyone currently on the court.Then, the source said, Trump went on to tell senators there is polling out there showing him winning in Illinois and Oregon.While the House meeting was decidedly less tense, it was similarly a Rorschach test for Republicans. If a member entered the meeting supporting Trump, that member was likely to leave thinking the presumptive nominee had done well. And if a Republican had taken a stand against Trump, well, he was unlikely to have changed his mind.“There was nothing in there that was new,” said Rep. Reid Ribble (R-Wis.), who says he won’t support Trump, after the meeting. “It was not a persuasive conversation for me.”Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), the chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group who has yet to endorse Trump, said the meeting was mostly subdued and didn’t do anything to change his impression of Trump. “I’m in the same place,” Dent said.Another Republican who’s shown great reluctance with Trump, Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, said he wasn’t particularly impressed.“It was the normal stream-of-consciousness that’s long on hyperbole and short on facts,” Sanford said.Sanford noted that Trump was asked at one point about protecting Article I powers in the Constitution. “I think his response was ‘I want to protect Article I, Article II, Article XII ― go down the list,” Sanford said, noting that there is no Article XII.According to members present at the House meeting, the topics Trump talked about included Hillary Clinton’s email scandal, his latest fundraising numbers, a pathway to victory through a number of nontraditional states, and his recent comments about Saddam Hussein.Trump mostly blamed the media for the controversy surrounding his comments that Hussein had done a “good job” of killing terrorists, saying outlets ignored that he’d also called Hussein a “bad guy.”While Trump cleaned up that controversy a bit, House Republicans didn’t ask Trump about his Star of David tweet, his racist attack on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, or any other number of shameful gaffes the GOP standard bearer has made.The toughest question Trump seemed to get was the first one of the day, from embattled Rep. Cresent Hardy (R-Nev.).Hardy noted that his district was heavily Hispanic and asked Trump what he was going to do to ensure that he didn’t hurt Republicans in Nevada.According to Hardy, Trump said he’d do everything he could to win Nevada and claimed he has more Hispanic support than former GOP nominee Mitt Romney did in 2012. (That was true in one poll, showing Trump with about 5 percent more support than Romney’s 27 percent in 2012, but he consistently polls between 18 and 23 percent with Hispanics.)Regardless of the actual polls ― because nothing matters ― Hardy said he was satisfied with that answer.Trump’s interaction with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was also a matter of opinion. Many Republicans said there wasn’t much to speak of, but others said they seemed to get along well, that Trump mentioned Ryan “20 or 25 times” and even seemed to defend the speaker for making critical comments about him.“There were a couple times where he said, ‘Look, I said this,’ and then he said ‘Paul had to react this way, and I understand it, I get it,’” Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas) reported. “But he said, ‘I’m going to make you proud.’”Ryan himself said it was “great meeting with our presumptive nominee.” “We had a very good exchange on just lots of ideas and lots of policy issues. So I thought it was a very good meeting,” he added.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Jon David Guerrero, 39, was apprehended shortly after a 55-year-old man was found with wounds to his upper torso around 4:30 a.m., police announced.Guerrero’s capture comes four days after authorities released another man arrested in the grisly attacks on the city’s homeless population, in which several men were set on fire as they slept.Police said the previous suspect was linked to the attacks, which began on July 3, because of his physical appearance and criminal history. He was later cleared of wrongdoing after spending a few nights behind bars.As of Guerrero’s arrest, three of the victims wounded in the savage attacks have died and one remains in critical condition. Friday’s victim, who has not been identified, is expected to survive, The Associated Press reported.San Diego Police Capt. David Nisleit spoke at a press conference Friday to assure the public that they now have the right person behind bars.“Today, detectives discovered physical evidence at the scene and at the suspect’s residence that definitively and uniquely links together the recent murders and brutal attacks on the city’s homeless community,” Nisleit said.According to NBC 7, Guerrero grew up in the wealthy city of Coronado and now lives in downtown San Diego in subsidized housing for the homeless.Guerrero was arrested multiple times between 1999 and 2009, according to arrest records obtained by the Los Angeles Times. He also had mental health cases filed against him in 2008, 2009 and 2011.Bob McElroy, the president of Alpha Project, which funds Guerrero’s residential building through the city’s Housing Commission, described him as a quiet man who generally kept to himself. He said Guerrero’s mother is his caregiver.“She’s there every day. It’s her son. Making sure he has groceries and his laundry is done,” McElroy told NBC. “She’s devastated.”Guerrero faces three counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder, and two counts of arson, San Diego police said.This is the second time in four years that a serial killer has targeted Southern California’s homeless, The New York Times reported.In 2012, Itzcoatl Ocampo was charged with killing six people over a two-month period. He died while awaiting trial.PREVIOUSLY:A man arrested following a series of deadly attacks on homeless people in San Diego, California, last week has been released due to a lack of evidence, police said.Anthony Alexander Padgett, 36, of Chula Vista, was freed Monday after authorities said they no longer were confident he was linked to fiery attacks that left three people dead and one critically injured.San Diego Police Capt. David Nisleit said the hunt for the killer is ongoing.“Last week, we truly believed that Padgett was the person depicted in the videos,” Nisleit told reporters Monday, noting Padgett’s physical appearance was similar to that of a suspect seen at a gas station at the time of the attacks.“We had probable cause to arrest Padgett,” Nisleit said. “That probable cause was based on his resemblance to the person depicted in the video at the Shell gas station, coupled with our knowledge of his 2010 conviction of lighting a homeless individual on fire.”Padgett was convicted of setting a man on fire in 2010, when he was also homeless. He served a four-year prison sentence for that crime, the Los Angeles Times reported.Padgett had acknowledged to local reporters that he resembles the suspect, who’s accused of beating and pouring gasoline on people as they sleep. But he denied having anything to do with the attacks, which took place over a four-day period. He was arrested Thursday and faced two counts each of murder and attempted murder, Nisleit said at the time.The third victim, identified by police as 23-year-old Dionicio Derek Vahidy, died in a hospital from his injuries Sunday, raising the death toll to three.Nisleit said new evidence could emerge that points back to Padgett. “This investigation remains the No. 1 priority for the San Diego Police Department,” he said.Until the suspect is captured, the police department’s homeless outreach team is canvassing the area to warn people. Police are advising those who sleep outside to remain vigilant, avoid sleeping alone and stay in open, well-lit areas.Crime Stoppers is offering a $1,000 reward to anyone with information that leads to an arrest in these cases.

36,TECH,Facebook’s Response To Philando Castile Shooting Video Isn’t Good Enough,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/philando-castile-shooting-facebook-live_us_577e4fa9e4b0344d514e081a,"The footage disappeared from the social network for about an hour, and users want to know why.",2016-07-07,"Footage captured via Facebook Live video shows an officer pointing his weapon at the fatally injured Philando Castile, who died Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577e54db1800002500fa4568.png?cache=i6rsXlstFY&ops=crop_6_4_603_326%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Facebook is offering few answers about a live video that shows the aftermath of the fatal police shooting of Philando Castile in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota.Diamond Reynolds, Castile’s girlfriend, broadcast the graphic footage with a smartphone after an officer shot Castile during a traffic stop. In the video, he can be seen bleeding to death while police officers shout orders at Reynolds, who narrates the situation as it unfolds.Reynolds’ video disappeared from Facebook for about an hour after the stream concluded, a Facebook spokeswoman told The Huffington Post, making it impossible for users to access or share the footage in the moments following the shooting. The video was eventually reinstated with a graphic content warning added by the social network’s community organization team. The way the traumatic encounter unfolded on the world’s largest social network communicates a lot about Facebook’s difficult position in modern media today.Facebook isn’t a news organization, technically. It’s a tech enterprise. But its products ostensibly exist to help users tell stories. So, when something happens with those stories, where does Facebook’s responsibility to the public begin and end?Two weird things happened with Reynolds’ video: It was temporarily deleted, and it reappeared with a content warning. Facebook doesn’t have much to say about either of these things, claiming a “technical glitch” caused the video to go down.“We’re very sorry that the video was temporarily inaccessible. It was down due to a technical glitch and restored as soon as we were able to investigate,” the spokeswoman told HuffPost, echoing a previous statement to TechCrunch.Facebook would not elaborate when pressed further. Asked if the glitch might have been related to an automated video moderation system, the spokeswoman simply said “Sorry, we don’t have any further details to share.”It’s a big deal when news outlets delete material from their websites. Removing content raises natural questions about censorship, accountability and business concerns ― as BuzzFeed learned last year, when it was criticized for deleting three posts under pressure from advertisers. Glitch or not, it’s natural for consumers to wonder why the video temporarily disappeared from Facebook, and the company’s response offers few helpful details.This lack of details is especially concerning because it’s a bit unclear where Facebook stands on this type of graphic content. The company could decide to ban all footage of weapons and death, but it hasn’t. So its overall editorial stance is ambiguous, especially in the era of live video.According to Facebook’s community guidelines:Sometimes, [content posted to Facebook involves] violence and graphic images of public interest or concern, such as human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share this type of content, they are condemning it or raising awareness about it. We remove graphic images when they are shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence....As for the graphic content warning, that addition of a warning label amounts to an editorial decision ― the sort you might see before war footage on the evening news. Someone at Facebook decided it was appropriate to warn users who might be unsettled by the video. That’s the right call, unquestionably, and it’s one that HuffPost also made in its article.Yet Facebook, reeling from a controversy over how its employees handle “trending” news, has shied away from being seen as a media enterprise. In fact, the company has taken a number of steps specifically geared toward de-emphasizing its role as a news platform. That isn’t going to work.Emily Bell, the founding director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, told HuffPost that it’s time for Facebook to be more transparent about how it delivers news to its 1.65 billion users.“They’ve always said ‘we’re just here as a platform,’ but once you introduce something like livestreaming for everybody, then clearly that’s not possible,” Bell said. “I don’t know what steps exactly went on within Facebook, except the video went down, and then it went up again with a graphic content warning. That’s definitely editorial intervention.”Facebook could mitigate these concerns by hiring an editor who interfaces with the company’s users, Bell suggests.“There is a role in explaining to the public the context and the process by which certain things are published and certain things are deleted on platforms,” she said. “They need somebody who is willing to engage in those kinds of debates, and somebody who’s able to make the process transparent, and who actually can go and ask difficult questions inside the company.”The reason why basically boils down to trust. Facebook is where millions of us get news today, and it’s the platform that directly hosted the shooting footage from Minnesota. But its processes are completely opaque, with few clarifying details provided to the media upon request.If Facebook delivers the news, doesn’t it have a responsibility to the public that consumes that news? Should it not explain its editorial choices, whether they amount to adding a graphic content label to a video or tweaking an algorithm to prioritize some stories over others?“Most people feel that it would be beneficial if they were a little bit more transparent about the steps and thinking that goes on behind their decisions,” Bell said. “If they do have sentient views about what the right thing to do is with the content they have, as opposed to ‘hey, we just put it all up there,’ that’s a real sort of maturity of the role the platform plays. But it’s very complicated as well.”UPDATE: 8:45 p.m. ― In a post on Facebook Thursday night, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his heart “goes out to the Castile family” and added that Reynolds’ video “reminds us why coming together to build a more open and connected world is so important ― and how far we still have to go.”He did not comment on why the video briefly disappeared from his site.

39,SCIENCE,This Tiny Robot Stingray Made From Gold And Rat Hearts Can Also Swim,Bahar Gholipour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robot-stingray-light_us_577e77afe4b01edea78cc38e,The latest from the cyborg department.,2016-07-07,"The robotic ray and its biological counterpart, little skate (Leucoraja erinacea).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577e8ef41a00002700dd006a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Scientists have unveiled a miniature robotic stingray the size of a toenail that sails smoothly through water, guided by pulses of light.The bio-inspired robot is a made of a mixture of living rat heart cells and artificial material. It is only 16 millimeters long ― less than two-thirds of an inch ― and weighs just 10 grams, or a third of an ounce.Just like stingrays and their Batoid relatives, the robot moves its flat body smoothly through water by flapping its fins in a wave-like motion. The movement of the fins is controlled by light pulses delivered to the heart muscles that line the surface of the fins.The development of the robot ray is described in the journal Science on Thursday.Kevin Kit Parker, an applied physicist at Harvard University who led the team of researchers, said the robot ray could interest scientists in a variety of fields ― from the cardiac physiologist interested in how the muscular architecture of the heart creates its unique pumping function, to the robotics engineer looking to use cells as a living engineering material.Parker himself specializes in developing tiny human organs that can be used to test drug safety and efficacy. But he took a detour into robotics after a visit to an aquarium with his daughter a couple of years ago.“The ‘eureka’ moment for the project came when my daughter Caroline and I were at the New England Aquarium,” Parker told The Huffington Post. “She was trying to pet a stingray. She put her hand in the water and the stingray quickly moved away from her hand in a very elegant way,” Parker said. He realized he could build a system with musculature similar to cell layers of the heart. “It struck me like a thunderbolt.” Parker and his colleagues created the robot ray out of a gold skeleton in the shape of a stingray, covered with a thin layer of flexible polymer. Next came the brain and muscle of the ray: an orderly lined sheath of approximately 200,000 heart muscle cells, grown from a rat embryo and put on top of the robot.To control the cells, the team turned to optogenetics, a method often used in neuroscience studies as a way to switch neurons on and off with light. Neurons or heart muscles don’t naturally respond to light. But in optogenetics, the cells are upgraded with a chunk of DNA. This special DNA codes for a protein that responds to light, rendering the cells light-sensitive. Now, with a burst of light, the modified cells contract, sending a downward wave through the fins. When the cells relax, the robot’s skeleton pushes the fins back up.The result is a swimming robot ray that follows the light source.Parker notes that in this design the cells are both the sensors and actuators, which comes with benefits and disadvantages: While living muscle cells are much more energy-efficient than synthetic actuators, they are also vulnerable. And to stay alive, they need to be immersed in a warm solution with salt and sugar. “Cells as a building material have a vote in whether or not I am going to have a good day in the lab,” Parker said. “They like to be wet, they are both robust and vulnerable, and they die.”Applying a source of light to each fin allowed the researchers to stimulate the right or left fin and steer the robot in either direction. Different frequencies of light control how fast the fins, and hence the robot, move about.Adam Summers, director of the Comparative Vertebrate Biomechanics Lab at the University of Washington, called the robot “a technical tour de force combining tissue engineering, robotics, organismal biology and biomechanics to yield a functional device.”“That they got it to flap is wonderful. That they were able to steer it is nothing short of amazing,” he said.Parker’s interest in aquatic creatures overlaps with his interest in understanding how the heart and various aspects of the anatomy help move blood in the body. And pumping and moving fluids is something marine life forms are very good at, he said.“The idea is to get a better insight into the human heart and heart disease by reverse engineering other forms of muscular pumps that we see in nature,” he said.This piece has been updated to include a comment from Adam Summers."

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) changed the subject to something a bit more important: black people being killed by police officers.Cummings, who is black, all but begged Comey to do something to help break the pattern of unarmed black people being killed by police. Just this week, Alton Sterling was shot dead in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, while selling CDs outside of a convenience store, and Philando Castile was shot and killed near St. Paul, Minnesota, after being pulled over for a busted tail light.“Mr. Director, if you do nothing else in your 2,000-plus days left, you have to go help us get a hold of this issue,” Cummings said. “It is so painful.

Still, he said he’s been pulled over “50 million times” for no clear reason, and it’s all connected to people of color being targeted by law enforcement.“As an African American man in this country, 66 years old, moving toward the twilight of my life, we cannot allow black men to continue being slaughtered,” he said.Comey sat quietly as Cummings spoke, but didn’t respond.Watch Cummings’ full remarks below:"

Reynolds recorded the aftermath of the encounter on Facebook Live, a video service that allows users to share video in real time. The San Fransisco 49ers quarterback uploaded part of the video, which has since gone viral, to his Instagram account on Thursday, along with the caption, “We are under attack!

44,MEDIA,Roger Ailes Clearly Underestimated Gretchen Carlson,Amanda Terkel and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roger-ailes-gretchen-carlson_us_577e60c0e4b01edea78cacfb,"She wasn't the dumb anchor she played on ""Fox and Friends.""",2016-07-07,"Steve Doocy, Gretchen Carlson and Brian Kilmeade at the Fox studios in 2011 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577e98381b00002700f6c8b2.jpeg?cache=YHU31N0lOl&ops=crop_6_367_2994_1545%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On “Fox and Friends,” Gretchen Carlson was the archetypal dim blonde on the couch, sitting between two men and struggling to understand the crazy ways of the modern world. “I just wanted to see how much of an insult it is to be called an ‘ignoramus.’ Since I didn’t know what it meant, I just googled it,” she said in one segment on what The Washington Post has called “TV’s dumbest news show.” At another point, she struggled to do grade-school math. The dimness of the caricature she played on TV was still bright enough to catch the eye of the “The Daily Show,” which produced this must-watch segment:Carslon’s act fits squarely within the ethos of a news network that thinks first and foremost about the attractiveness and sex appeal of its on-air female talent. The roving camera high up above Megyn Kelly’s (not coincidentally glass) desk, for instance, is known as a “leg cam.” Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes once reportedly called a host on air and demanded, “Move that damn laptop, I can’t see her legs!” Carlson has said she wasn’t allowed to wear pants on “Fox and Friends.”A Fox News employee told The Huffington Post’s Michelle Fields that Ailes often talks about the way he hires on-air talent: “He always brags to people about how he doesn’t do polling or testing when he chooses his on-air talent. He told me that if he was thinking of hiring a woman, he’d ask himself if he would fuck her, and if he would, then he’d hire her to be on-camera,” the employee said. “He then said if it was a man he’d think about whether he could sit down for a baseball game with him and not get annoyed of him. If he could, then he’d hire him.”For Ailes, on-air women were nothing but bodies for viewers.Carlson wasn’t terribly convincing at playing an idiot: She comes off too much like somebody smart trying to figure out how to look dumb. Ask any moron you know, and they’ll be able to tell you what an ignoramus is.As Jon Stewart discovered, Carlson was valedictorian of her high school class. She graduated with honors from Stanford University and studied at Oxford University. She was a classically trained violinist.She’s no ignoramus, but she played one on TV. But she was also crowned Miss America. Did Ailes, the veteran pitchman, start to believe his own pitch ― that Carlson was in real life the dimwit she pretended to be on air?If so, it may account for Ailes’ epic miscalculation and underestimation of Carlson.On Wednesday, Carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Ailes, accusing him of long-running pattern of abusive behavior. She alleged Ailes he ogled her in his office; asked her to turn around to view her backside; commented frequently on her physical appearance; and demanded sex, then fired her when she turned him down.She also accused Steve Doocy, her “Fox and Friends” co-host, of engaging in a “pattern and practice of severe and pervasive sexual harassment” that included “mocking her during commercial breaks, shunning her off air, refusing to engage with her on air, belittling her contributions to the show.”Last year, Carlson opened up a bit about some of the harassment she’s faced over the years (although she didn’t then disclose the treatment by Ailes): The first incident came when I was nearing the end of my term as Miss America. I was thrilled to schedule a meeting with a top TV executive in New York who promised to help me gain entrée to the business. He called a bunch of shows and sang my praises, and then he took me out to dinner. Afterward we got into his car and he gave the driver the address of the friend I was staying with. As we sat in the backseat, he suddenly threw himself on top of me and stuck his tongue down my throat. I pulled away from him, horrified. As we reached my friend’s apartment building, I jumped out of the car and fled. When I got upstairs I started crying. I thought I had done something wrong.Carlson advocated that people stop seeing sexual harassment as a “women’s issue” and stop blaming the victim. “Even when I was harassed, I always knew that my brains and talent were responsible for my success, not my looks,” she wrote. “Unfortunately, I still have to put up with the constant drumbeat of ‘lookism.’ People think it’s okay to refer to a professional woman as a ‘blonde bimbo.’ We should refuse to tolerate this attitude when it occurs.”Ailes denied Carlson’s allegations Wednesday, dismissing her (in the statement below) as a disgruntled employee who wanted to get back at the network for not renewing her contract. The response is similar to what other women often face when they accuse a man of sexual harassment: questions about their motivation, their timing and their sincerity. It was a surprisingly unoriginal rejoin from a legendary public-relations knife-fighter.It turns out there was at least one fool at Fox News ― it just wasn’t Carlson."

Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) would be a sign that Hillary Clinton is serious about reaching out to them.,2016-07-07,"Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), right, was the only sitting senator to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577d6dde1900002400219abd.jpeg?ops=crop_17_484_4443_2489%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― There’s no doubt that most of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) supporters like Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown. Both Democratic senators, often named as potential vice presidential picks for Hillary Clinton, are progressive and have a strong track record on the economic issues they hold dear. But increasingly, another name is popping up: Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the only sitting senator who endorsed Sanders for president.“Bernie supporters, they would love it. He’s qualified something up and down,” said Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Sanders who previously served as president of the Communications Workers of America. “I was out on the campaign with him in Oregon and elsewhere, and he was amazing,” Cohen added. “He works incredibly hard. Modest ― all of the things we’d want in a vice president.”Merkley’s name hasn’t been floated much in media reports about Clinton’s shortlist, and her campaign didn’t return a request for comment. Needless to say, he’s a long shot. But he’s still someone who Sanders supporters say would be a solid choice if Clinton wants to show she’s serious about bringing them into the fold for November.“By bringing in the only sitting senator who endorsed Bernie onto the ticket, I think that that’s a strong way to signal to the political revolution that the Clinton campaign and Hillary Clinton herself gets what the political revolution brings to the table,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the progressive group Democracy for America, which endorsed Sanders in the primary. Robert Reich, who served as President Bill Clinton’s labor secretary, also floated Merkley in a Facebook post recently: Merkley supporters argue that the senator has four main selling points. First, he’s strong on economic issues, on which Sanders supporters still view Clinton with some unease. He’s a vocal opponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and although Clinton is also against it, she touted it when serving as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state. Sanders supporters say they’d be reassured if Merkley were on the ticket. Merkley has also been a leader on financial reform in Congress ― another area where Sanders supporters are skeptical of Clinton and her ties to Wall Street.Second, choosing Merkley as opposed to Ohio’s Brown, for example, wouldn’t necessarily cost Democrats a Senate seat. If Clinton chose Brown as her vice presidential running mate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) would get to appoint his replacement to serve until the next election in 2018. In Oregon, Merkley’s seat would remain vacant until there’s a special election.The law in Warren’s state of Massachusetts allows the governor ― currently a Republican ― to name a replacement until a special election is held 145-160 days later. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), however, has already been looking for loopholes to shorten the amount of time a gubernatorial replacement would be able to be in office. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), another vice presidential contender, would have his seat filled with an appointment by the state’s governor, who is also a Democrat.Third, Merkley won re-election running on a strong economic populist message in 2014, the year Republicans retook control of the Senate. He grew up in working-class Oregon and supporters say he could connect with voters who might be less enthusiastic about Clinton. Merkley could also aid Clinton when she’s in office, argues Campaign for America’s Future co-founder Robert Borosage. “Not incidentally, Merkley would be a great vice president,” Borosage wrote in a recent post. “No one has Biden’s Senate years, but like Biden, Merkley is an experienced legislator with broad ties in the Senate. He knows how to build coalitions. As Speaker of the House in Oregon, he assembled and passed a remarkable reform agenda.”Merkley’s office did not return a request for comment for this article.A few Sanders supporters are also still sore that Warren stayed neutral in the presidential primary, believing that if she had backed Sanders, he could have won more states, including Massachusetts. “I definitely think there is an extremely small sample of Bernie supporters that may never forgive Elizabeth Warren,” Chamberlain said. “But that is a tiny, tiny fraction of the 12 million votes that Bernie Sanders got across this country.”He added that at the end of the day, Sanders supporters would be thrilled with either Warren or Merkley.“The bottom line is that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both are fighting for a real economic vision for America that rebuilds the middle class,” he added. “Bernie Sanders supporters get that, and they fully support Elizabeth Warren.”"
