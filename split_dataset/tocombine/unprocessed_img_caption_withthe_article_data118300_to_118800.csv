But there it was on Saturday, gaining traction around the world. Legendary Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon will miss the team's opening match against England on Saturday, according to multiple reports. The 36-year-old goalkeeper was expected to start for Italy in his record-tying fifth trip to the World Cup. Buffon, the Juventus goalkeeper and Italy captain, suffered an ankle injury during training on Friday, reported ESPN.Co.UK.In a message shared on Twitter on Saturday, Buffon appeared to confirm the reports of his absence. ""Life is great,"" he wrote, as translated at FIFA.com, ""and a missed match or another missed World Cup is not going to change my opinion on that !! And, even if you're not out on the pitch, there are other ways in which you can play an important role. So, go on Salvatore Sirigu !! Go on the lads !! Go on Italy !!""With Buffon sidelined, Salvatore Sirigu would likely be between the posts for Italy. The 27-year-old Paris St-Germain goalkeeper was on the Italy squad for the 2010 World Cup but did not see any action. While Sirigu may prove up to the task as Buffon's replacement, he would be hard pressed to fill his shoes during the pre-match national anthem. UPDATE 5:54 p.m. ET: Buffon is not in the lineup for Italy and Sirigu is getting the start."

The Rams announced on Thursday that they had signed all 11 players selected by the team in the 2014 NFL draft, including Sam. A first-team All-American defensive lineman from the University of Missouri, Sam signed a four-year, $2.65 million contract, with $46,000 of it guaranteed, reported Mike Garafolo of FOX Sports. All of the Rams' rookie signees went through some financial education before signing their deals.

""So we just felt like this time would be better served putting them in situations from an educational standpoint, financial planning, those kind of things.

In his first press conference with the Rams, Sam made his aim clear. ""I'm determined to be great,"" he told reporters."

Costa Rica arrived in Brazil as the clear underdog in Group D alongside Uruguay, England and Italy but prevailed on Saturday at Estadio Castelao in Fortaleza thanks a potent mixture of resilience, fearlessness and Joel Campbell. Uruguay, a semifinalist at the 2010 World Cup, grabbed an early 1-0 lead when striker Edinson Cavani coolly converted a penalty in the 24th minute. Playing without injured striker Luis Suarez, Uruguay would take that slim advantage into the second half. The two-time World Cup champions had never lost a game in the tournament when leading at the half, according to ESPN Stats & Info. With Campbell taking a leading role, Costa Rica would change that. The 21-year-old striker on loan to Olympiacos from Arsenal scored his first career World Cup goal to pull Costa Rica level in the 54th minute with a one-time, left-footed blast. (GIF via @FlyByKnite)Just minutes later, Costa Rica took a shock lead when Oscar Duarte scored on a diving header at the far post following a free kick.Campbell showed that he is not just a finisher when he set up Costa Rica's third goal with an incisive through ball to Marcos Urena, a late substitute, in the 84th minute."

Before we bow down to a seemingly fearless and altruistic pioneer of electric vehicles and libertarianism, it's important to point out the ongoing contradictions with Musk and markets.",2014-06-14,"Elon Musk, co-founder and chief executive officer of Tesla Motors Inc., pauses during an interview at the company's assembly plant in Fremont, California, U.S., on Wednesday, July 10, 2013. Tesla, is building Model S electric sedans faster than its initial 400-a-week goal as demand and the companys production skills increase, Musk said. Photographer: Noah Berger/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30ef4200000e800001c13.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's an Elon Musk world, and we're just living in it.This week, Musk announced that Tesla would yank all of its patents and open up their technology to whomever so desires it. Musk even went so far as to announce via Tesla's blog that they ""will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology."" Bold move for anybody. Especially bold move for an electric car company on the brink of building a $4-5 billion lithium-ion battery gigafactory.To be clear, declaring a noble refrain from suing over what is now apparently open source technology is a monumental shift in the tech industry -- a sector that can get ugly and expensive when it comes to patent litigation.Alex Tabarrok rightly predicts this announcement will probably be the center of academic discussions for years to come. And any good economist would pat Musk on the back for finally heeding the almost universal advice on the massive costs and minimal benefits that accompany the patent system. Musk, a man often lumped into the category of ""libertarian"" in part thanks to the company he keeps, says Tesla is doing this for the good of the industry. And this move certainly speaks to his, ahem, patented belief in free market principles.But let's not forget: Tesla once sued Top Gear for libel when Jeremy Clarkson famously trashed the Tesla during a track test. When the brakes ""broke,"" according to the show, Tesla dismissed it as simply a vacuum pump that had failed. The brakes weren't broken! 'Tis only a flesh wound!Um.This somehow led Musk to conclude that Clarkson is anti-American for hating on Tesla and its literal electric innovation, which is another fun rabbit hole to go down, but back to why this matters: For a company so particular about how its technology is represented, I can't be the only one surprised at Tesla's gracious announcement.So before we bow down to a seemingly fearless and altruistic pioneer of electric vehicles and libertarianism, it's important to point out the ongoing contradictions with Musk and markets.Musk  tweetedthat he got rich off of PayPal and Zip2 ""w zero govt anything."" But if you can remember, Musk got a lot of flack when Tesla took a near $500 million loan from the Department of Energy and then boasted of paying it off early while forgetting to mention that if it hadn't, default was inevitable at the end of 2013. It's worth noting that, no, this does not make Tesla worse than Solyndra since the feds didn't ask for ""venture capital-style compensation in return."" Frankly, I'm glad that the U.S. government didn't demand ownership in Tesla, seeing as how they're not the best business owners. But either way, the point still stands that it's easy for Musk to pat himself on the back for doing something in which the alternative was abundantly worse.Tesla also received $34 million in tax breaks from California (a notoriously awful business tax climate) for building a factory in Fremont. California is no doubt a state that needs broad, sweeping reform, but taking a tax carve-out is not very libertarian. And worse yet, Tesla is now flaunting its gigafactory in front of four, but really five, states. Musk announced the multibillion dollar and 6,500-job creating battery factory would be built in Nevada, New Mexico, Texas or Arizona. Quick to panic, California responded frantically with a proposal that offers Tesla ""financial incentives"" along with an unhooking of the regulatory gate that keeps the permitting process line for environmental companies in the Golden State cruelly and unusually long.Musk specifically noted California's regulatory environment as a reason Tesla would set its sights elsewhere. But seeing as the company is headquartered in Palo Alto as well, it would make sense to house the gigafactory there. It's too early to tell what will happen, but with a practically blank check from the California government, I think it's safe to say Musk knows what he's doing. And demanding special regulatory treatment is about as crony as it gets.So is Musk a true libertarian? No. Does it matter? Not really. Regardless of his actual intentions, Tesla provides endless examples of overbearing regulation and how its inability to keep up with innovation means that innovation has the power to slip out of the ever-tightening governmental noose. Tesla isn't perfect, but it makes perfect libertarian fodder. The patent announcement is one to follow closely to see how the electric car market develops as a result. But one thing is certain: Musk is no libertarian. He's just damn good at playing the game."

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., speaks during the Iowa Republican Party's annual Lincoln Day dinner, Friday, April 11, 2014, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The visit is Ryan's second trip to Iowa since running as the GOP's 2012 vice presidential nominee. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cd0d220000ba01dd792f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rather than confront poverty by extending jobless benefits to the long-term unemployed, endorsing a higher minimum wage, or supporting jobs programs, conservative Republicans are taking a different tack.They're peddling three big lies about poverty. To wit:Lie #1: Economic growth reduces poverty.""The best anti-poverty program,"" wrote Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, in the Wall Street Journal, ""is economic growth.""Wrong. Since the late 1970s, the economy has grown 147 percent per capita but almost nothing has trickled down. The typical American worker is earning just about what he or she earned three decades ago, adjusted for inflation.Meanwhile, the share of Americans in poverty remains around 15 percent. That's even higher than it was in the early 1970s.How can the economy have grown so much while most people's wages go nowhere and the poor remain poor? Because almost all the gains have gone to the top.Research by Immanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty shows that forty years ago the richest 1 percent of Americans got 9 percent of total income. Today they get over 20 percent.It's true that redistributing income to the needy is politically easier in a growing economy than in a stagnant one. One reason so many in today's middle class are reluctant to pay taxes to help the poor is their own incomes are dropping.But the lesson we should have learned from the past three decades is economic growth by itself doesn't reduce poverty.Lie #2: Jobs reduce poverty.Senator Marco Rubio said poverty is best addressed not by raising the minimum wage or giving the poor more assistance but with ""reforms that encourage and reward work.""This has been the standard Republican line ever since Ronald Reagan declared that the best social program is a job. A number of Democrats have adopted it as well. But it's wrong. Surely it's better to be poor and working than to be poor and unemployed. Evidence suggests jobs are crucial not only to economic well-being but also to self-esteem. Long-term unemployment can even shorten life expectancy.But simply having a job is no bulwark against poverty. In fact, across America the ranks of the working poor have been growing. Around one-fourth of all American workers are now in jobs paying below what a full-time, full-year worker needs in order to live above the federally defined poverty line for a family of four.Why are more people working but still poor? First of all, more jobs pay lousy wages.While low-paying industries such as retail and fast food accounted for 22 percent of the jobs lost in the Great Recession, they've generated 44 percent of the jobs added since then, according to a recent report from the National Employment Law Project. Second, the real value of the minimum wage continues to drop. This has affected female workers more than men because more women are at the minimum wage.Third, government assistance now typically requires recipients to be working. This hasn't meant fewer poor people. It's just meant more poor people have jobs.Bill Clinton's welfare reform of 1996 pushed the poor into jobs, but they've been mostly low-wage jobs without ladders into the middle class. The Earned Income Tax Credit, a wage subsidy, has been expanded, but you have to be working in order to qualify.Work requirements haven't reduced the number or percent of Americans in poverty. They've merely increased the number of working poor -- a term that should be an oxymoron.Lie #3: Ambition cures poverty.Most Republicans, unlike Democrats and independents, believe people are poor mainly because of a lack of effort, according to a Pew Research Center/USA Today survey. It's a standard riff of the right: If the poor were more ambitious they wouldn't be poor.Obviously, personal responsibility is important. But there's no evidence that people who are poor are less ambitious than anyone else. In fact, many work long hours at backbreaking jobs.What they really lack is opportunity. It begins with lousy schools.America is one of only three advanced countries that spends less on the education of poorer children than richer ones, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Among the 34 O.E.C.D. nations, only in the United States, Israel and Turkey do schools serving poor neighborhoods have fewer teachers and crowd students into larger classrooms than do schools serving more privileged students. In most countries, it's just the reverse: Poor neighborhoods get more teachers per student. And unlike most OECD countries, America doesn't put better teachers in poorly performing schools, So why do so many right-wing Republicans tell these three lies? Because they make it almost impossible to focus on what the poor really need - good-paying jobs, adequate safety nets, and excellent schools.These things cost money. Lies are cheaper.ROBERT B.

Bush addressing the nation on Iraq beneath a banner reading 'Mission Accomplished' aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln as it sails for Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California. Three years after his famous photo-op before the banner, Bush on 01 May 2006 declared that the war-torn country had finally turned a corner in establishing security and democracy.

These are precisely the people who kicked open the sectarian hornets' nest in 2003 when they invaded Iraq and unleashed years of civil war that led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees.  Of course the current Iraqi government bears a great deal of the responsibility for the current breakdown in security. As Fareed Zakaria wrote in Friday's Washington Post:The prime minister and his ruling party have behaved like thugs, excluding the Sunnis from power, using the army, police forces and militias to terrorize their opponents. The Sunni insurrection that began in 2003 was finally tamped down by General David Petraeus when he engineered power-sharing arrangements between the Shiites and key elements of the Sunni community. Prime Minister Maliki has systematically abrogated many of those deals, reneged on commitments and created the conditions where Sunni insurgents have real sympathy among many in the Sunni population. That is why the Obama Administration has insisted that increases in U.S. military assistance be conditioned on major changes that help create a political system inclusive of all of the elements in Iraqi society. Remember that Maliki came to power as a result of the decisions of the Neo-Cons in the Bush Administration who intentionally dismantled all vestiges of Sunni power -- including the Iraqi Army and bureaucracy -- shortly after the invasion.  And, most importantly, the invasion that unleashed the sectarian civil war was sold to the American people as a quest to eliminate Sadam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction -- and as a means of destroying his non-existent links to Al Qaeda.  How ironic that the Neo-Con invasion itself created the conditions that allowed Al Qaeda-inspired organizations like Al Qaeda in Iraq -- and now the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq (ISIS) -- to become viable forces in the country. Now, Neo-Cons like McCain are calling on the President to ""bring back"" the Bush team ""who knew how to win."" Unbelievable. The people who led us into the Iraq War have no business even commenting on foreign policy -- much less managing it. In fact, any self-respecting television network should simply ignore anything they have to say, since they led us into the worst foreign policy disaster in half a century. The Iraq War will ultimately cost the American taxpayers trillions of dollars. It caused the collapse of our international reputation. It costs hundreds of thousands of lives -- including 4.500 American soldiers, and it wounded and maimed hundreds of thousands more. And the Iraq War unleashed simmering sectarian conflicts that had existed for centuries throughout the Middle East.  Now those sectarian conflicts have spilled over into an awful civil war in Syria and are part and parcel of international tensions throughout the region. And these ""geniuses"" should be brought back to manage Iraq policy? Oh, they say, President Obama should have been a tougher negotiator when it came to maintaining a residual force of training personnel in Iraq. But that ignores that the Maliki government refused to agree to conditions that every other country in the world provides for Americans who are stationed on their soil. The fact is that Maliki did not want American troops to remain in Iraq because he is entirely beholden to the Iranians who did not want any residual American troops in Iraq.  But that, of course, is beside the point where most Americans are concerned. The vast majority of Americans didn't want to maintain a residual force of American troops in Iraq either. They wanted to end America's involvement in the Iraq War -- and do not want American troops to be sent back to Iraq or any other war in the Middle East.  In fact, Republican attacks on President Obama because he ""didn't finish the job"" in Iraq run head-long into the buzz saw of American public opinion. It is completely out of touch with the views of ordinary Americans.  The main reason why President Obama is now faced with having to do everything he can to help stabilize the situation in Iraq -- short of sending back American troops -- is that the Republican Neo-Con gang kicked over the sectarian hornets' nest with their pointless invasion and macho military adventurism in the first place. Remember President Bush's ""mission accomplished"" on the carrier deck back on May 1, 2003. That was over a decade ago. The mission was ""accomplished"" only if the goal was to destabilize the Middle East, cost America trillions of our treasure and kill and maim hundreds of thousands of human beings.  The people who conceived and executed the invasion of Iraq don't deserve to be given the authority to run a lemonade stand, much less U.S. foreign policy.

14,COMEDY,Secrets of the 'Playing House' Writers' Room with Jessica St. Clair and Lennon Parham,"Karen Geier, ContributorCo-Founder, Shyndyg.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/playing-house-writers-room_b_5493530.html,I recently sat down with Lennon and Jessica on the eve of their two episode season finale to discuss what is different about how they write Playing House.,2014-06-14,2014-06-13-playinghouse_aspot_finale_2490x1418_preview.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-06-13-playinghouse_aspot_finale_2490x1418_preview-thumb.jpg,"Once upon a time, there was a show called BFFs on NBC. It was a cult hit, (even creating a Brony-like subculture of men who were serious fans) but never made it due to low ratings. The Internet was not best pleased. Then, USA Network began talks with Lennon Parham and Jessica St. Clair to create another show that showcased the pair's uncanny chemistry and their realistic approach to friendship. The result was Playing House, a story of a woman who leaves her husband late in her pregnancy, and her best friend comes home from China to help. The show has received critical praise, and has a rabid fanbase online. I recently sat down with Lennon and Jessica on the eve of their two episode season finale to discuss what is different about how they write Playing House.Karen: Looking back on the past season of Playing House, what has the reaction been for you?Jessica: It has been a dream come true. All of our fans from BFFs were so excited to join us again, and they seem really obsessed with the world we've built. We really tried to focus on making a bigger world: a small town filled with these charming freaks from the UCB, and people really responded to that. They want to live in the town, they want to be in on our inside jokes, and nicknames, and they get all the details. The best part for me has been when people tweet the little details of the show, like the fact that we're wearing Bird Bones' and Mark's robes that in this past episode that we stole from them in episode two. It makes us feel so good that they noticed. We're comedy nerds, so we spend a lot of times planting those things.Lennon: I don't know if everybody does it this way, but we're so grateful that people are connecting to it, and that they're picking up on our little turns of phrase. When we're on Twitter, we're not only live tweeting episodes and talking about behind-the-scenes stuff, we actively try to respond to everybody. Jessica:  It's nice too, because based on the feedback, I think people were really desperate for a show that accurately portrayed what female relationships are in life. People send us photographs of themselves and their best friends from when they were 9, and then pictures of them as adults. It's so nice, because we knew it was true for us, but not necessarily true for others. It turns out, they find it relatable!Karen: Your method of writing is very different than most writers rooms, because you improvise the first draft, and then work on it from there. Do you worry that due to being so experienced at improv together and also being best friends that you might leave other people out? Jessica: With true best friends, you can have an entire conversation without saying a word. Lennon and I will have a whole conversation at a wedding just by looking at each other. You have a mind meld. Our details might be different, but the way that best friends show up for each other is universal. Lennon: Because Jess and I came up through the UCB theatre, you learn quickly what works and what bombs. You learn what can become a good joke and can be repeatable. You have a shorthand about how to introduce a joke to someone. Jessica:  Lennon and I have our own language, but the Upright Citizens Brigade has its own language. Because USA gave us free rein to cast whomever we wanted, we cast our best friends. The jokes they bring to the table in their improv with us are jokes we would have 100 percent written had we had the chance to. Lennon: Yeah, and it comes across like we've known each other forever because we have. Karen: Something unique to your writing style is your ability to make small stories very big on details. There's a layering effect where a joke starts out small and then gets bigger and bigger as the show or episodes progress. Lennon: It's pretty simple to me: we come from a really grounded world where anything you say could be the thing that the scene becomes about. We're always treating it as if we would treat it in real life. It's all observation. When you get into a fight with your partner or a friend, you usually have some weird, specific thing that you hold on to, that you fight about that has nothing to do with what's going on. That scene with Maggie in the interrogation room where all she wants is a pizza, she doesn't actually want a piece of pizza, it's all this other really complicated stuff underneath, but how it's coming out is just ""give me a fucking piece of pizza!""Jessica:  The specifics are what make people connect to it, because it's like life. At the UCB, we have this thing called the game. It's hard to explain,and it's harder to learn. What happens is you start a scene and you improvise, and some kind of a mistake happens. Something odd or weird just naturally within the first almost three lines of a scene. Lennon: You can choose to make that happen too, but most often, it comes out organically.Jessica:  You learn when that happens, to seize on it and you heighten it. That becomes the thing that makes you unique. When we're writing, we always ask ourselves, ""What's the game of this scene?"" So, the game is that Mark doesn't want the strip show, but they're going to keep pushing it. We try to build it so each scene stands alone. There should be a comic game in each scene. When we had non-UCB people in our writer's room, they said ""What the hell is the game? It sounds like The Secret.""Lennon: A good example of that is the scene with Steve and the car seat. We're waiting, and unbeknownst to us is a very good looking man is coming out to help us with the car seat. The first thing he says is interpreted as sexual, and so the whole thing is that he's basically having sex with us through the installation. That's the game. Jessica:  And Keegan heightened the game by doing that horrible gesture where it looks like he's pummeling a woman and it only lasts eight seconds. Lennon: The heightening is that he's terrible at it, and he says he's the fastest in the world.Karen: Playing House is about a baby, but it's not about a baby in the way that Modern Family is. How do you make your show defy pregnancy and baby tropes?Jessica:  We always write about what we're experiencing. Both Lennon and I had a baby during the pre-production of this show. When we started in the writers room, Lennon's baby had just been born and I was pregnant. So, for season one, we were more interested in writing about the high stakes emotions you feel and experience when you're pregnant. We also wanted to put a focus on what it's like to reconnect with an old friend. In episodes nine and 10, you're going to see what it's like when the baby comes, and you'll see that their lives aren't over. They're still going to be trying to find love, and trying to find themselves career-wise. The baby is along for the ride.Lennon: It's kind of like what we say when people ask us, ""are Maggie and Emma going to find their true love?"" And it's ""yeah, I mean maybe..."" The baby's going to be around, but the primary relationship we're focused on is the two women. We want to see the adventure they're going to go on with these other people.Jessica:  If we make it to season two, one of the ideas we're playing with is maybe Maggie goes back to grad school. So, maybe she doesn't want to tell all her friends there that she has a new baby, so it'll just be funny to see her pumping in a bar bathroom, and me ferrying the milk.Karen: Have you drawn on any real life highs or lows in the writing of the show?Jessica:  When my childhood best friend died, Lennon was my first call. She said ""where are you? I am coming to get you."" I realized that not only have we gotten to do our dreams together, but in the process, I've found myself in the most healthy friendship I've ever had. Karen: I can't leave you without asking about Bosephus. When you're putting Bosephus into an episode, are you hoping that people will ""get it?""Lennon: Bosephus has been living inside of me for a while. The actual story about someone putting on a disguise and going to a bar to spy on someone happened to one of our writers. Jessica:  Bosephus came up in the BFF writer's room.Lennon: We were going to have him be a tag. It was a whole scene where Jessica and Joe were involved in a high stakes poker game with a diverse group of players, and then at the end, they get home and tell Lennon and act like everything is all right, and hanging on the door is Bosephus' hat.Jessica:  Bosephus had to see the light of day, because let's face it: He's too fucking funny not to, but we needed to ground it. Anything can work if you ground it in reality. I have to be there to say ""this is crazy!"" And it has to be grounded in emotional reality and for a reason. She's doing it to protect her brother. Our show has to live in a real place. We also have someone in our room called Anthony King who is the reality police. Playing House's two-part season finale airs Tuesday at 10/9 Central on USA Network. "
15,IMPACT,From Prostitute to Professor: The 7 Lessons of Maya Angelou's Messy Life,"Yolanda Young, ContributorYolanda writes for The Guardian and USA TODAY. The founder of ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prostitute-to-professor_b_5466065.html,"While we now refer to Angelou as a renaissance woman, until she published I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings in her 40s, her life resembled what is referred to in ghetto parlance as a hot mess.",2014-06-13,"Dr. Maya Angelou speaks on race relations at Congregation Bânai Israel and Ebenezer Baptist Church on January 16, 2014 in Boca Raton, Florida.(Photo by Jeff Daly/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1c4b72100000001c7513b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The death of Dr. Maya Angelou provided us the opportunity to once again delight in her memoirs, which chronicle the eclectic, bohemian first half of her life. Yet, we know from her writings that such praise was often withheld as she pursued her dreams of being a dancer and poet while raising a young child as a single mother. How many times must she have been urged to settle down and give up her artistic and cultural pursuits, which time and time again left her broke and broken? While we now refer to Angelou as a renaissance woman, until she published I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings in her 40s, her life resembled what is referred to in ghetto parlance as a hot mess.This messiness is what we all fear. It is why rather than pursue our dreams, we settle into the lives expected of us. Cubicles and cul-de-sacs become the things of our imagination. Only happiness and satisfaction studies suggest they are not enough. A GALLUP Poll last year found that only 30 percent of U.S. workers are passionate about their work. The majority (52 percent) are unhappy with their jobs and put little energy into their work while another 18 percent actually hate their jobs and actively work to undermine coworkers. We sacrifice our dreams only to find ourselves restless, bored and frustrated in midlife having realized what Angelou told us all along; ""making a living is not the same thing as making a life."" Worse still, we recognize the irony in discovering after layoffs, financial setbacks and divorce that the ""mess"" is unavoidable.These unmet expectations and realization that youthful aspirations have been abandoned are suspected as the cause of feelings of discouragement and depression among those in midlife. The British think tank NatCen Social Research found that studies show that people between 35 and 55 suffer a dip in well-being. A separate study that analyzed data from ""nationally representative"" surveys in Australia, Britain and Germany found that the bell curve in well-being dips to its lowest point around the ages of 40 to 42.Even those who choose to pursue unconventional dreams don't escape these feelings, especially if such pursuits have come at the expense of nearly everything else. I abandoned life as a lawyer in favor of one as a writer, activist and entrepreneur. Now having entered midlife without any of our culture's success markers -- husband, children, two-car garage -- I have had to answer, both to myself and to others, the question of whether the path I've chosen was a wise one. Reflecting on Angelou's has helped me find the answers.1. Be uniquely you.Angelou described herself in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings as ""a too-big Negro girl, with nappy black hair, broad feet and a space between her teeth that would hold a number-two pencil."" She knew such a girl would've perished trying to conform to mainstream conventions. ""If you're always trying to be normal, you will never know how amazing you can be."" Instead of fretting over not being a swan, Angelou reinvented herself as a rare bird. As many biographers have noted, she won't be remembered for her poems or plays, but for her memoirs and for being Maya Angelou. The key to discerning one's authenticity is quite simple: ""Listen to yourself and in that quietude you might hear the voice of God.""2. When it comes to failure, be courageous.Angelou was a marvelous failure. Her most noteworthy stage performance, playing the seamstress in the two-woman play Mary Todd Lincoln, earned her a Tony nomination but closed on opening night. The rolling stone never stuck to one thing for long. She moved from coast to coast, continent to continent, sometimes making poor childcare decisions, one of which resulted in her son's brief abduction. She didn't have a stable home or steady job until she was in her 50s, an age at which many are preparing for retirement. She divorced several times but would would never confirm the exact number, ""for fear of sounding frivolous."" Aware of all her failings, Angelou was brave enough to look at herself. ""We have to confront ourselves. Do we like what we see in the mirror? And, according to our light, according to our understanding, according to our courage, we will have to say yea or nay -- and rise!""3. Know who your friends are.One would be hard-pressed to identify a significant black figure Angelou didn't know. She danced with Amiri Baraka. Billie Holiday visited her home and explained the meaning of Strange Fruit to her young son. While a calypso dancer she worked with Alvin Ailey. James Baldwin gave her the introductions that would lead to the publication of her first memoir. These were people she deeply cared for, but in an Essence interview, she had this to say of friendship.There's a marked difference between acquaintances and friends. Most people really don't become friends. They become deep and serious acquaintances. But in a friendship you get to know the spirit of another person, and your values coincide. Friends may disagree, but not about serious matters. A friend will stand for you when you are no longer able... Years ago one of the slick White women's magazines asked if they could photograph me with my closest friends for an issue they were doing on friends. The editor wanted me to bring Oprah. I have 30 years on Oprah. She calls me her friend, her mother, all that. I am very close to her in a motherly way. So I told [the magazine], 'I have three dear friends -- Dolly McPherson, Jessica 'Decca' Mitford and M.J. Hewitt -- they are sisters to me.'4. Believe you can do anything.For Angelou, inexperience was never a reason not to take on an interesting job. Angelou's only criterion was seemingly that a new occupation share little to no similarities with her previous one. At sixteen, she became San Francisco's first African-American streetcar conductor and later passed herself off as an experienced Creole chef. She held jobs dancing in a nightclub, stripping paint from old cars, and singing Calypso. She knew nothing about being a journalist when she accepted a position as an editor for The Arab Observer,"" an English-language magazine. She said of the experience, I stayed at the Arab Observer for over a year and gradually my ignorance receded. I learned from Abdul Hassan how to write an opinionated article with such subtlety that the reader would think the opinion his own...I received a raise from Dr. Nagati, the respect of my fellow workers and a few compliments from strangers...She made her television debut as Kunte Kinte's grandmother in the acclaimed television adaptation of Alex Haley's Roots. And in the one-time high school dropout who never attended college became the Reynolds professor of American studies at Wake Forest University in North Carolina.5. Forgive others and yourself.In addition to enduring the injustices that came along with being poor, black and female in the South, Angelou was also raped as a child and beaten as a young woman. In a May 9th interview at her home she told Armstrong Williams, ""I've learned that forgiving is one of the greatest gifts that I can give myself...And as soon as I do I feel lighter, brighter and better.""In Gather Together in My Name, Angelou shares one of her lowest periods when she served as a pimp for two lesbian prostitutes and sometimes worked as a prostitute herself. In one interview, she said of the experience. If you happen to fall into that sort of experience, what you have to do is forgive yourself. If you're in the very gutter, see where you are and admit it. As soon as you admit it, you can be like the prodigal son, the prodigal daughter. Get up and go home -- wherever home is. Get up and go to a safe place, someplace where your spirit is not kicked and brutalized and your body not misused and abused. Get up. But you can't get up unless you see where you are and admit it.6. Persevere.In A Song Flung Up to Heaven, Angelou tells of her midlife crisis which was accompanied by great sorrow. Returning to the States after the end of a romance in Africa, Angelou became a Civil Rights activist only to be witness to the Movement's greatest tragedies. She was working with Malcolm X to establish his foundation when he was assassinated New York City. Three years later she was working as the northern coordinator for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. when he was gunned down in Memphis on Angelou's 40th birthday. For a time, Angelou withdrew from society unable to deal with the tragedy, but eventually she harnessed her grief and regrets to write her seminal work, I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings. From then on, she would rise at dawn and set out for the motel room where she would write. Her only companions were a Bible, a dictionary, a thesaurus, a stack of legal pads, and a bottle of sherry. Having written her way out of the worst time in her life, she credited it with her survival. ""All my work is meant to say, 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated...Nothing will work unless you do.""7. Change.Angelou was a master of reinvention. She didn't settle on a name until after her first marriage, claiming her childhood nickname and a twist on her first husband's last name. For Angelou, change was essential. Perhaps more so when one decides nothing can be done at all. ""If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude.""Follow @yolandayoungesq"

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e834200000c1010185d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"VATICAN CITY (RNS) Underscoring the close ties between Christianity and Judaism and calling Holocaust denial “madness,” Pope Francis told an interviewer that “inside every Christian is a Jew.”In a wide-ranging interview published Friday (June 13) in Spain’s La Vanguardia newspaper, the pope said dialogue between the two faiths can sometimes be a “hot potato.”“I believe that interreligious dialogue must investigate the Jewish roots of Christianity and the Christian flowering of Judaism,” Francis said. “I understand it is a challenge, a hot potato, but it is possible to live as brothers.”Francis’ statement seems to go further than his predecessor, St. John Paul II, who made headlines in 1986 as the first pope to visit Rome’s main synagogue and declared Jews to be the “elder brothers” of the Christian faith.“Every day, I pray with the Psalms of David. My prayer is Jewish, then I have the Eucharist, which is Christian,” the Argentine pontiff added.The pope also took the opportunity to criticize Holocaust denial as “madness” while defending the record of Pope Pius XII, who led the Roman Catholic Church during World War II.Francis will soon have to decide whether to advance the sainthood cause for the controversial wartime pope, who is accused of failing to speak out publicly against the mass murder of Jews. For years, Jewish leaders and Nazi hunters have demanded the Vatican open up its secret wartime files.Francis said he was concerned about “everything which has been thrown at poor Pius XII,” while stressing that he sheltered Jews in the convents of Rome and other Italian cities, as well as the popes’ summer residence in Castel Gadolfo.“I do not mean to say that Pius XII did not make mistakes — I make many mistakes myself — but his role must be read in the context of the time,” Pope Francis said.Francis added that he breaks out in an “existential rash” when he hears people speak against Pius and the church’s wartime record while ignoring inaction by the Allies fighting against Nazi Germany.“Did you know that they knew perfectly well the rail network used by the Nazis to take the Jews to the concentration camps? They had photographs,” he said. “But they did not bomb these rail lines. Why? It would be nice if we spoke a little bit about everything.”During Friday’s interview with the Barcelona daily, Francis was also asked about his own security, saying he refused to travel in a bulletproof “sardine can” vehicle because he wants to mingle with ordinary people.“It is true that anything can happen, but let’s face it, at my age I have nothing to lose,” the 77-year-old pontiff said.The former archbishop of Buenos Aires was also asked how he would like to be remembered as a pope.“I have not thought about that,” Francis said. “But I like it when you remember someone and say ‘He was a good guy, he did what he could, and he was not that bad.’ I would be happy with that.”"

He has made six-figure contributions to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's campaign and funds the state Republican Party.His contributions to Rauner, first reported by the Chicago Tribune, are stratospheric. Overall, Griffin has given $3.6 million to the Republican's campaign to defeat Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn. The contributions include the use of Griffin's personal jet to travel the state.The $2.5 million contribution to Rauner's campaign is the largest The Huffington Post could identify to a political campaign in recent history. A number of states have no campaign contribution limits, but none have seen a single contribution this large in two decades, according to state records. (Individuals and corporations have likely given larger contributions, when adjusted for inflation, in the past.)It's not as though Rauner was strapped for campaign cash. In fact, Rauner, a wealthy equity executive who lives in the tony suburb of Winnetka, has self-funded his campaign with $6.6 million.In a perverse twist of campaign finance laws, Rauner's use of his own wealth to fund his campaign unlocked Griffin's giant contributions. Illinois first enacted campaign contribution limits for state elections after two straight governors -- George Ryan (R) and Rod Blagojevich (D) -- were convicted of corruption. Following the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision that opened the door to unlimited independent campaign spending, the state changed those limits to allow them to be waived if a candidate self-funded, or if an independent group spent more than $250,000.Griffin is not just a partisan who wants his picture taken with political leaders at galas. He has wide business interests in the state and supports policies that promote charter schools, slash public employee pension benefits, loosen regulation of finance, and lower taxes for the rich.Pando Daily revealed that Griffin's hedge fund Citadel had purchased a large amount of Marriott Corp. stock just as political leaders in Chicago and Illinois approved $55 million in city resources for building a Marriott hotel on coveted real estate.Quinn, the incumbent Democrat, also has raised large contributions, including a total of $1 million from Fred Eychaner, a Chicago-based millionaire and major Democratic donor."

It states if a player hits the wrong ball he must return to where his ball was and hit his shot again with a two-shot penalty.If Mahan or Donaldson didn’t return to the spots and re-hit they would have been disqualified if they had teed off on the next hole.“Off the tee it looked like Hunter's was in the left center and Jamie's was on the left edge,” Wood said. “And we got up there and they were switched and we didn't realize it.”The double-bogey six that both players recorded put both in a difficult spot to make the cut.Mahan bounced back quickly with a birdie on the first hole, but it was a bit of a rollercoaster ride for Mahan from then on with four bogeys and two birdies on his second nine to seemingly miss the cut by one shot. Mahan finished with a 2-over 72.For Donaldson, his round was spiraling out of control far before the double bogey at the 18th, turning in an 8-over 43 on his first nine and coming home in 3 over for a disappointing 11-over 81."
