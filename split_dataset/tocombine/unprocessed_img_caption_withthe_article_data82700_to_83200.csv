0,POLITICS,This San Francisco Cafe Is Just Fine With The $15 Minimum Wage,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/san-francisco-minimum-wage_us_55b62f53e4b0224d8832b207,"Owners say the wage hike makes sense, given the city's sky-high cost of living.",2015-07-27,"<p>The counter at Café UB in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood includes a Kyoto cold-brew tower for making a kind of cold coffee developed in Kyoto, Japan.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b634b71400002e002e0c3d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO -- If the opponents of a $15 minimum wage were going to devise a hypothetical small business to illustrate their arguments, they'd probably come up with something like Cafe UB. The petite San Francisco coffeehouse is exactly the kind of locally owned, low-margin neighborhood business that critics say a $15 minimum wage would hurt the most.But Cafe UB is doing just fine amid San Francisco’s ongoing transition to $15. In fact, its owners embrace the change -- and not just for the typical political reasons. They say it is good for business.“We are in support of it, because we need our employees, and our employees need to live here,” said manager Nicole Martin earlier this month. “It is expensive to live in San Francisco.”Cafe UB -- the name is meant to suggest that the eatery is whatever “you” want it to “be” -- is a popular spot in San Francisco’s tony Castro neighborhood. On sunny days, customers gather on the patio for homemade scones and empanadas. Inside, the air is thick with the aroma of locally roasted coffee, which some people get chilled with one of the cafe's elegant Kyoto cold-brew towers.Customers often praise the individual attention they receive from “Al and Nicole” -- that is, Al Simball, the cafe’s owner, and Martin, his girlfriend.But as is often the case with a small business, the cafe’s charm is the product of hard work that yields relatively thin profit margins. Martin told The Huffington Post that when Simball bought the cafe (then known as “Urban Bakery”) in 2013, he was putting in 80-hour weeks and employing just three people -- sometimes fewer. Since then, the cafe has grown enough that Simball is now able to employ six people, reducing his weekly workload to 60 hours. Martin said that Simball has always tried to pay employees as much as he can. When he first bought the business, minimum wage in the city was $10.55, but Simball set pay at $11 an hour -- not including tips.“In general, as a new business we continue to juggle resources to make it all work and be a good employer,” Martin said.San Francisco’s latest minimum wage hike is happening in stages, with the wage floor climbing a bit higher every year. It's scheduled to reach $15 on July 1, 2018, and rise with inflation thereafter. The current minimum wage of $12.25 has been in effect since May 1.Cafe UB pays its staff the minimum $12.25, but Martin estimates that workers already make more than $15 an hour with tips. She did not say whether the cafe had already been planning to raise its wages before voters overwhelmingly approved the citywide wage increase in November.Regardless, Martin says they wholeheartedly support the new $15 minimum mandate in light of San Francisco’s high cost of living.So rather than urge customers to vote against the minimum wage increase, or to repeal the measure once it passed -- a not-uncommon practice, even in liberal cities like Washington, D.C. -- Martin and Simball simply asked their patrons to support modest price increases as a way of offsetting the additional labor costs.“We had a little sign out front, and we just said: ‘In support of the minimum wage increase, we will be adjusting our prices,’ and thanking them for their business -- you know, pretty simple,” Martin recalled. “It was well-received. I can’t say that our customers got upset about it.” The price increases ranged from 25 cents on a cup of coffee to slightly more for food items, Martin estimated. “We shifted some things around, like maybe removed a side and offered a sandwich for a little bit more,” she said. On the whole, Martin sees the higher wages across the city as benefiting Cafe UB. In fact, it's actually helping them to hire workers. San Francisco's cost of living is so high, she said, that ""you don’t get flooded for applications"" for a low-paying position like ""barista.""Cafe UB’s relatively smooth transition thus far has dovetailed with the predictions of liberal-leaning economists that San Francisco’s minimum wage increase would not lead to job losses or hour reductions. “Previous economic research, including research on San Francisco’s 2003 minimum wage ordinance, has found little to no measurable effect on employment or hours from minimum wage policies,” noted an August 2014 policy paper released by the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley.That paper went on to predict that the higher minimum wage would prompt businesses to increase their prices modestly -- but that they would see much of the cost offset by the benefits of higher worker retention and improved performance.Of course, not all of San Francisco’s small businesses have been as fortunate as Cafe UB. Borderlands, an iconic sci-fi bookstore and cafe in the Mission neighborhood, nearly closed its doors earlier this year due to the wage hike. Compared to cafes, bookstores have a harder time passing on new expenses to customers through price increases, since in most cases, the publisher’s recommended price is already there on a book's cover.Conservative policy analysts have seized on the struggles of Borderlands, and other San Francisco bookshops like Comix Experience, as evidence that raising the minimum wage can have unintended consequences that even liberals will appreciate. They note the irony of beloved urban institutions like independent bookstores teetering under the weight of minimum wage hikes championed by their liberal customers.For now, though, these complaints have done little to dull the momentum of a nationwide drive for a $15 minimum wage -- a rate nearly double the current national minimum of $7.25, which advocates say is grossly inadequate. The fast-food worker campaign ""Fight for $15,"" which is backed by organized labor, scored a victory last week when a wage board convened by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) recommended a $15 minimum wage for the state’s fast-food workers. Cuomo is expected to approve the change.Outside of New York, the biggest wins for advocates of a $15 minimum wage have occurred at the city level. In addition to San Francisco, Seattle enacted a gradual increase to $15 in June 2014. And Los Angeles adopted a $15 minimum wage last month, becoming the largest city yet to do so.The $15 minimum wage has become a prominent issue in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, with every major candidate speaking to it in some way. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to endorse a nationwide $15 minimum wage in a July 16 interview with Buzzfeed, saying that “what you can do in L.A. or in New York may not work in other places.”By contrast, two of Clinton’s competitors in the Democratic field, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), have both come out in favor of enacting the $15 minimum wage nationwide. Yet even in San Francisco, the $15 minimum wage increase did not enjoy unanimous support. The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce opposed the change, arguing last year that the attempt to pass it by ballot initiative ""[flew] in the face of collaboration and partnership.""But Martin said that no group had actively solicited Cafe UB’s help in campaigning against the increase.“You know, I don’t recall that really,” she said. “I don’t recall being asked to oppose it. You know, I felt like there was just a lot of support in general. It’s kind of like, we know it needed to happen. And they just had to figure out a way to make it work.”"
1,POLITICS,Republican Presidential Candidates Will Do Just About Anything For Attention,Igor Bobic and Amber Ferguson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-presidential-candidates-attention_us_55b650f9e4b0a13f9d19170e,"Forget substance, it's all about putting on a show.",2015-07-27,"<p>Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) went at a copy of the U.S. tax code with a chain saw, fire and a wood-chipper. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b673d81400002f002e0e63.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A historically large number of candidates and one very loud entrance by real estate mogul Donald Trump is threatening to turn the Republican presidential race into a silly, MythBusters-style contest to see who can blow stuff up the best.In just the last week, several GOP presidential hopefuls have engaged in stunts, questionable rhetoric and grandstanding -- even prompting a strongly worded rebuke from President Barack Obama, who on Monday suggested they were engaging in ""ridiculous"" antics in ""an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines.""To the dismay of Republican Party leaders, Trump has continued to dominate in the polls. In the first national telephone poll since his widely denounced comments about Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Trump was found topping the pack at 18 percent. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) placed second at 15 percent.All the media surrounding the Trump show has left his rivals attention-starved. The celebrity hotelier's trip to the border on Thursday even overshadowed the presidential announcement of a more electable, experienced candidate like Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R).Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) caused quite a bit of fireworks during a rare Sunday session in the Senate, during which he claimed Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) lied to him and his colleagues about running an open amendment process. Because impugning a senator's character on the floor violates Senate rules, Cruz earned a reprimand from Senate President Pro Tempore Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).""We are not here on some frolic, or to pursue personal ambitions,"" Hatch said. ""We serve the people, not our own egos."" Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) made his play on Saturday, when he accused the president of marching Israelis to ""the door of the oven"" by dealing with Iran over its nuclear program. After condemnation from Democrats and the Jewish community, Huckabee was happy to trumpet his remarks on social media and to his supporters, whom he emailed Monday to complain Obama was ""directly"" attacking him.Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), meanwhile, has been reduced to torturing a copy of the U.S. tax code with a chain saw, fire and a wood chipper. Such stunts are typically characteristic of Senate races, not White House bids. For example, Joe Manchin memorably used a rifle to shoot a copy of a proposed ""Cap and Trade"" bill during his successful bid for the upper chamber in West Virginia. The stunt might have given Paul a photo op, but it didn't exactly spell out presidential material.The presidential candidate who perhaps best capitalized on Trump mania was Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). After Trump gave out the South Carolina senator’s personal phone number to the public, Graham went on a rampage against flip phones in a viral video produced by the website IJReview. Graham, who actually owned a flip phone, is seen putting a number of the devices through a blender, dropping them off a rooftop, and chopping them with a butcher knife.Great media strategy or desperate ploy for attention? Probably a bit of both. As it stands right now, ten days out from the first GOP debate in Cleveland, Graham would not make the cut for a primetime television slot. His 0.3 percent support among Republican voters places him short of the top 10 criteria host Fox News has set for the debate.The cable network has not yet announced which national polls it will use to judge which candidates will participate. But one thing’s for certain: bottom-rung contenders are likely to engage in more of such antics as the debate nears.Watch the video above."
2,POLITICS,Sandra Bland Wasn't The Only Woman Abused By Male Cops In Texas,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sandra-bland-texas-cops_us_55b67ed9e4b0224d8833369b,HuffPost analyzed over 100 pages of complaints against Dallas officers.,2015-07-27,"<p>People mourn the death of Sandra Bland at the Mt. Glenwood Memorial Gardens West cemetery on July 25, 2015, in Willow Springs, Illinois.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_598_0_4091_2545%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The death of Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old woman believed to have taken her own life after being subject to a forceful arrest, is drawing attention to one Texas county's troubling legacy of racial disparities. But Waller County is hardly the only place where women have been mistreated by male police officers.Bland was pulled over in Waller County for failing to signal when changing lanes after an officer allegedly sped up behind her. The dashcam video shows the officer attempting to drag Bland out of her car and threatening her with a Taser, leading to a physical confrontation.To get a sense of how common such encounters are, The Huffington Post analyzed over 100 pages of complaints made by women against cops in Dallas, which is about three hours away from Waller County. The documents, which cover a two-year period, include only those reports for which at least one allegation was sustained -- or judged as valid -- by authorities. Some of the complaints describe officers smashing a woman's car with a baseball bat, stalking a former girlfriend and being arrested for domestic violence. Other cases sound like Bland's: male cops resorting to violence on the job.Below is a sample of these cases along with the disciplinary penalties the officers received. (The dates listed are when the incident occurred.) None of the reports showed the cops losing their jobs.Dec. 28, 2013: A woman alleged that two male officers used unnecessary force and made inappropriate comments during her arrest. She further alleged that one officer took a picture of the X-ray of her broken arm at the hospital with his personal cell phone. (It's unclear from the documents how her arm was broken.) One officer was found to have used inappropriate force, the other ""improper action."" Both cases were still awaiting review. Oct. 3, 2013: Two senior corporals went undercover to investigate prostitution activity. A woman arrested for prostitution said the officers threw her down and kicked her in the eyes. Both officers were exonerated from the use-of-force allegations, but multiple officers involved in the incident were found to have violated the procedures for using body recorders (microphones). They all received ""advice & counseling.""June 16, 2013: A woman was having a party in her backyard when officers arrived to discuss parking violations. They returned later to address a complaint of loud music. The woman turned the music down. She said a cop yelled at her guests to ""get out,"" pointed his finger in her face and told her to ""shut"" her ""mouth."" When her son began to videotape the incident, the officer allegedly grabbed the phone out of his hand and said, ""You don't record nothing."" The officer received ""advice & counseling"" for ""discourtesy/unprofessionalism.""  April 19, 2013: A woman pulled over for traffic violations said that a male senior corporal made inappropriate comments and searched her body and vehicle. The complaint about inappropriate comments was sustained, as well as one of illegal or improper search. The officer was written up.March 1, 2013: A woman said that a male officer, who had been dispatched to the residence, bumped into her twice and used profanity. She also said that two cops threw her down and dragged her across the ground. Both officers were exonerated from the use-of-force allegations. One was written up for using ""profane or indecent language.""Dec. 17, 2012: A woman alleged that after she was arrested and handcuffed, a male officer put his hands around her neck, pushed her against a wall and choked her. The officer was initially suspended. After an appeal to the chief of police, the officer received ""documented counseling.""Nov. 25, 2012: A woman alleged that a male officer tried to bully and intimidate her. The officer was written up for ""discourtesy/unprofessionalism.""Nov. 1, 2012: A woman alleged that a male police officer pointed his gun at her. The officer was written up for ""improper display of weapon.""The Dallas Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.Read more on Sandra Bland at the links below:"

In the 18 months he'd served as foreman, the crew made considerable progress, but the terrain they were now forced to conquer was rocky and unforgiving.The early dawn light, softened by the moisture in the air, scarcely lit the winding path to the job site. The distant rhythm of iron sledgehammers thumping in sequence was soothing and forced an early-morning smile from Phineas' lips. His crew was on the job a full 15 minutes before first whistle.Phineas had earned his reputation as ""the most efficient and capable foreman"" in the company. The discipline and passion he brought to the site ensured projects were completed on time, and the social niceties he espoused made him a favorite with the men he supervised. A ""shrewd, smart business man,"" he walked his talk, avoided the alluring depravity of the local saloon, and got along famously with everyone he met.The day wore on with the usual efficiency. Yard by yard Phineas and his crew laid the tracks, blasting through the rugged terrain in the quest to speed travel for busy commuters. By the time he glanced at his watch at 4:30, they had added half a mile to the rail line.With skill Phineas thrust his 43 inch tamping iron into the angled blasting hole and entertained thoughts of the day he retrieved this special rod from the local blacksmith. The brawny craftsman had explained to Phineas with uncharacteristic glee that this iron was unlike any other he had ever seen.Before taking the next swing in his daily exercise of geometry and strength, Phineas signaled his assistant to pour sand in the blasting hole. The layer of sand would protect the powder from exploding prematurely while he packed it with the tamping iron.As Phineas reared back to swing, he was startled by a shrill racket behind him. Peering over his right shoulder, he discovered the crew in the pit had knocked over a large load of boulders they were transferring to a platform car with a crane. Phineas sighed briefly to mourn the setback, then completed his swing with the iron, naïve to the fact that his assistant was also distracted by the noise.The assistant failed to place sand in the hole and the scrape of Phineas' iron against the rock perimeter of the crevice created a spark big enough to ignite the unprotected powder at the bottom. The raw force of the explosion launched Phineas' tamping iron like a rocket. It pierced his face below his left eye and continued upward through the top of his head and beyond. The iron finally settled in the weeds 100 feet from the spot where Phineas stood.Trajectory of the 43 inch tamping iron that traveled through the head of railroad foreman Phineas Gage on September 13th 1848. The iron's violent path removed the entire front portion of his brain. His skull and the original iron that went through it are still on public display in the Warren Museum at the Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts.Phineas' body flew backward from the impact and he lay silently for a moment, writhing in shock. A thin whisper of air disguised his overwhelming desire to scream─it was all the noise he could force from his lungs. He could feel the wound below his eye where the 13 pound tamping iron--43 inches long and a full inch and a quarter in diameter--had thrust itself through his face. He had no sensation of the massive hole the iron left as it emerged through the top of his head.The world as he knew it changed forever that afternoon.Phineas' loyal crew rushed to his side and looked into his eyes for any sign of life. They laughed anxiously as Phineas peered up at them and groaned, ""I think I'm going to need to see Dr. Harlow."" His sense of humor still intact, Phineas' men loaded him into an ox cart to take him to town.Sitting upright in the cart with his own strength, Phineas noticed his assistant walking somberly beside him. He leaned over and made a request typical of any foreman leaving the job site, ""Hand me the book please."" Like young boys watching their father perform a Herculean feat of strength, the bemused railroad workers stood in awe as Phineas logged his exit from the job site.At 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, September 13, 1848--just one hour after his horrific accident--Phineas Gage stood unassisted on the patio of the town hotel. The local physician, expecting nothing coherent to come from Phineas' lips, asked his crew for a briefing. ""Well, here's enough work for you Doctor,"" Phineas interrupted before anyone could speak, ""The iron entered here and came out my head here.""Despite having the front portion of his brain scooped from his skull much like you might a hunk of melon at breakfast, Phineas could think and speak much like he could before the accident. He was treated earnestly in the coming weeks by Dr. Harlow and eventually his physical wounds healed. The accident seemed to leave nothing more than scars and blindness in his left eye.Phineas' survival and quick recovery baffled everyone. As he tried to return to business as usual on the railroad, they realized something was hauntingly different. His first peculiar new habit was his temper. He cursed like a sailor and gave conflicting orders that followed his mood. Every impulse Phineas had exploded unfettered into action, and he made his men feel like they were an inch tall.The man who never arrived late for work was now apathetic about getting the job done.For the 11 years Phineas lived after the accident, he was transformed. Dr. Harlow's detailed notes describe a pervasive change in his behavior that could only be explained, literally, by the missing portion of his mind,""The effect of the injury appears to have been the destruction of the equilibrium between his intellectual faculties and the animal propensities. He was now capricious, fitful, irreverent, impatient of restraint, vacillating...His physical recovery was complete, but those who knew him as a shrewd, smart, energetic, persistent business man, recognized the change in mental character. The balance of his mind was gone."" Lessons From PhineasTo put it bluntly, Phineas' emotional intelligence left his head for good that morning. In removing the front portion of his brain, the tamping iron took with it his ability to turn his emotions into reasoned action. Phineas was left a walking, talking, sentient being, yet one with very little self-control.His intellect remained intact. He could do complicated math problems and understood the logistics of building the railroad. He lived independently, just as he had before the blast. Those he met assumed his rash behavior was just a part of his personality, but previous acquaintances knew differently.Phineas' grisly accident continues to intrigue us today. His survival was truly a miracle and the changes in his behavior teach us more about the brain than the most sophisticated technology available. Modern devices can map the brain to show which areas are most important for different types of thought, but no gadget can show how a human behaves with a portion of his brain removed.Unlike Phineas, we have a choice in how we respond to our emotions. Each of us takes in information from the world around us through the five senses. Everything we see, smell, hear, taste, and touch travels through the body in the form of electric signals. These signals pass from cell to cell until they reach their ultimate destination, the brain. If a mosquito bites you on the leg, that sensation creates signals that must travel to your brain before you are aware of the pest.Our sensations enter the brain in one place at the back near the spinal chord. Complex, rational thinking happens on the opposite side of the brain, at the front, which is the same part that Phineas lost.When the electric signals enter your brain, they must travel all the way across it before you can have your first logical thought about the event. This is a problem because they pass through the limbic system along the way. This is the area in the brain where emotions are experienced. Signals passing through the limbic system ensure you have an emotional reaction to events first.The front of the brain can't stop the emotion ""felt"" in the limbic system. Instead, the two areas communicate constantly. This process of communication is the physical source of emotional intelligence.After his accident, poor Phineas was all emotion. In losing the entire front portion of his brain, he lost his ability to reason and react to his emotions. Indeed, everything he encountered, every experience he had, resulted in a rash emotional response. Phineas had zero ability to manage his feelings or even understand their presence. Every hour of every day Phineas was overcome by his emotions.Our brains are wired to make us emotional creatures. By experiencing the emotional response to an event first, our feelings are strong motivators of behavior. The location of the limbic system ensures that emotions play a critical role in every action we take.  The Critical LinkIt should be no surprise, then, that emotional intelligence is critical to success in the workplace. TalentSmart tested emotional intelligence alongside 33 other important workplace skills, and found that emotional intelligence is the strongest predictor of performance, explaining a full 58% of success in all types of jobs.Of all the people we've studied at work, we've found that 90% of top performers are also high in emotional intelligence.Naturally, people with a high degree of emotional intelligence make more money--an average of $29,000 more per year than people with low emotional intelligence. The link between emotional intelligence and earnings is so direct that every point increase in emotional intelligence adds $1,300 to an annual salary.These findings hold true for people in all industries, at all levels, in every region of the world. We haven't yet been able to find a job in which performance and pay aren't tied closely to emotional intelligence.Bringing It All TogetherAfter the accident Phineas lost his job at the railroad. Intelligence alone was not enough for him to succeed. In the years that followed he had difficulty holding down a job anywhere else. With the rational part of his brain gone forever, poor Phineas didn't stand a chance.Remember the plight of poor Phineas and don't take your rational brain for granted.And please share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

In the 18 months he'd served as foreman, the crew made considerable progress, but the terrain they were now forced to conquer was rocky and unforgiving.The early dawn light, softened by the moisture in the air, scarcely lit the winding path to the job site. The distant rhythm of iron sledgehammers thumping in sequence was soothing and forced an early-morning smile from Phineas' lips. His crew was on the job a full 15 minutes before first whistle.Phineas had earned his reputation as ""the most efficient and capable foreman"" in the company. The discipline and passion he brought to the site ensured projects were completed on time, and the social niceties he espoused made him a favorite with the men he supervised. A ""shrewd, smart business man,"" he walked his talk, avoided the alluring depravity of the local saloon, and got along famously with everyone he met.The day wore on with the usual efficiency. Yard by yard Phineas and his crew laid the tracks, blasting through the rugged terrain in the quest to speed travel for busy commuters. By the time he glanced at his watch at 4:30, they had added half a mile to the rail line.With skill Phineas thrust his 43 inch tamping iron into the angled blasting hole and entertained thoughts of the day he retrieved this special rod from the local blacksmith. The brawny craftsman had explained to Phineas with uncharacteristic glee that this iron was unlike any other he had ever seen.Before taking the next swing in his daily exercise of geometry and strength, Phineas signaled his assistant to pour sand in the blasting hole. The layer of sand would protect the powder from exploding prematurely while he packed it with the tamping iron.As Phineas reared back to swing, he was startled by a shrill racket behind him. Peering over his right shoulder, he discovered the crew in the pit had knocked over a large load of boulders they were transferring to a platform car with a crane. Phineas sighed briefly to mourn the setback, then completed his swing with the iron, naïve to the fact that his assistant was also distracted by the noise.The assistant failed to place sand in the hole and the scrape of Phineas' iron against the rock perimeter of the crevice created a spark big enough to ignite the unprotected powder at the bottom. The raw force of the explosion launched Phineas' tamping iron like a rocket. It pierced his face below his left eye and continued upward through the top of his head and beyond. The iron finally settled in the weeds 100 feet from the spot where Phineas stood.Trajectory of the 43 inch tamping iron that traveled through the head of railroad foreman Phineas Gage on September 13th 1848. The iron's violent path removed the entire front portion of his brain. His skull and the original iron that went through it are still on public display in the Warren Museum at the Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts.Phineas' body flew backward from the impact and he lay silently for a moment, writhing in shock. A thin whisper of air disguised his overwhelming desire to scream─it was all the noise he could force from his lungs. He could feel the wound below his eye where the 13 pound tamping iron--43 inches long and a full inch and a quarter in diameter--had thrust itself through his face. He had no sensation of the massive hole the iron left as it emerged through the top of his head.The world as he knew it changed forever that afternoon.Phineas' loyal crew rushed to his side and looked into his eyes for any sign of life. They laughed anxiously as Phineas peered up at them and groaned, ""I think I'm going to need to see Dr. Harlow."" His sense of humor still intact, Phineas' men loaded him into an ox cart to take him to town.Sitting upright in the cart with his own strength, Phineas noticed his assistant walking somberly beside him. He leaned over and made a request typical of any foreman leaving the job site, ""Hand me the book please."" Like young boys watching their father perform a Herculean feat of strength, the bemused railroad workers stood in awe as Phineas logged his exit from the job site.At 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, September 13, 1848--just one hour after his horrific accident--Phineas Gage stood unassisted on the patio of the town hotel. The local physician, expecting nothing coherent to come from Phineas' lips, asked his crew for a briefing. ""Well, here's enough work for you Doctor,"" Phineas interrupted before anyone could speak, ""The iron entered here and came out my head here.""Despite having the front portion of his brain scooped from his skull much like you might a hunk of melon at breakfast, Phineas could think and speak much like he could before the accident. He was treated earnestly in the coming weeks by Dr. Harlow and eventually his physical wounds healed. The accident seemed to leave nothing more than scars and blindness in his left eye.Phineas' survival and quick recovery baffled everyone. As he tried to return to business as usual on the railroad, they realized something was hauntingly different. His first peculiar new habit was his temper. He cursed like a sailor and gave conflicting orders that followed his mood.
