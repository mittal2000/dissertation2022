For Liverpool Fashion Week, which kicks off Monday, the British city has instated a tanning bed ban in order to protect models' skin from cancer and other health risks.Amanda Moss, Liverpool Fashion Week's organizer, tells the Telegraph that Liverpudlians are the first in the runway world to ban the practice. ""We want our models to look their absolute best, which means not putting themselves at risk of skin cancer or premature aging from the sunbeds,"" she says.In the U.S., California and New York have banned the practice for minors, as tanning beds cause over 170,000 cases of skin cancer in America each year. Tanning risks occur in similarly shocking amounts in Liverpool, where 50 percent of minors tan, far higher than the 11 percent national average. Still, there's little acknowledgement of tanning's dangers on the runways. Moss hopes to change the perception of bronze equaling beauty. As the Telegraph quotes:""We hope that by showing how gorgeous our models look at this year's Liverpool Fashion Week, we will help sunbed users in the city realise they don't need to get on the beds to look great. Our girls can still have that golden glow, but they'll get it from a bottle, not from the beds.""Perhaps we hear little criticism of tanning in the model community since weight issues prove more pressing. Israel banned the use of underweight models in 2012 and Vogue issued a similar ban regarding the models it features in its pages in hopes of promoting positive body image. We're proud of Liverpool for acknowledging that many factors contribute to a model's overall health, and we hope that these new restrictions will help to keep talent in tip-top shape this Fashion Week and beyond.Models in Liverpool won't look like this:Want more?

On Sunday, Oct. 6, the 2012 Miss Universe winner and her team headed to the Taj Mahal as part of a 10-day tour of India to spread awareness about women's issues. While there, Culpo took part in a footwear photo shoot on the marble ledge known as the Diana Seat, modeling multiple pairs of shoes taken from a large bag and using the Taj Mahal as the backdrop. The Hindustan Times, which described the shoot as ""covert 'promotion,'"" reported that the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) is now threatening to file a complaint with the police against the agency behind the trip because ""any branding or publicity on the Taj premises is prohibited."" “We are gathering information from the tourism police about those who were managing the visit,"" an official with ASI said Monday, per the Hindustan Times. ""After we get the names, an FIR [first information report] would be lodged against the agency involved in violating norms at the Taj."" ASI's Syed Muuzzar Ali told NDTV that initial reports on the incident suggest there may have been a lapse on the part of the Central Industrial Security Force and tourism police, whose officials allegedly saw the Miss Universe photo shoot going on at the Taj Mahal but did not stop it. Neither the ASI nor the Miss Universe Organization were immediately available for comment. It is unclear what brand of shoes was being photographed, however, the 21-year-old beauty pageant winner visited the monument with fashion designer Sanjana Jon, according to NDTV. As for Culpo, she seemed unaware of any controversy surrounding the visit. On Monday, she uploaded a photo of the Taj Mahal to the Miss Universe Instagram account, writing: ""We made it to the Taj Mahal. One of the most beautiful places I've ever seen!!!! So amazing."" UPDATE: The Miss Universe Organization released a statement to The Huffington Post, apologizing for ""any unintentional harm"" caused by the incident at the Taj Mahal. ""Throughout her reign, the Miss Universe Organization continually creates video diaries of our titleholder to keep fans and sponsors up to date on her travels and to share in the experience,"" the statement said. ""As part of these videos, we sometimes incorporate sponsors into these shoots. The filming that took place outside the Taj Mahal was never intended to be used as a commercial nor was it meant in any way to be disrespectful.""

But one of the most talked-about French foods of the moment, the macaron, may seem impossible to make at home. Though it's difficult, it's not impossible.Macarons (which, despite some pronunciation confusion are quite different than macaroons), are French desserts constructed by sandwiching ganache between two meringue cookies. They come in a variety of flavors (and vibrant colors) and taste, light, sugary, and absolutely delicious. While macaron bakeries, including the renowned Ladurée, have been fixtures of French culture for centuries, stores based in the States have started popping up over the past decade -- and have quickly turned us into macaron enthusiasts.Though we won't pretend they're simple (or quick) to make, macarons can and should be made at home -- we promise they're worth the effort, and that no one will judge you if they're not perfect. The following 15 recipes will get you started on your macaron making, but don't limit yourselves to the flavors in the slideshow. Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

Tank tops and flip-flops are the prevailing dress code today. I see her walking toward me, fully clad in a brilliant red dress and feathered headpiece, a stunning impossible vision that for an instant I think is a heat mirage. I want to say something as she passes by, but I'm dumbfounded by her elegant luminosity. On instinct, I circle the block and there she is again, coming around on 75th Street. This time I say hello. I'm drenched and though I see her skin also glistening from the heat. She is graceful, composed and friendly. We stand there talking for quite a while. A man looking on from his second story window comes down and snaps some pictures of her. ""I'm a painter!"" he says. After he leaves, she continues on about her radio ministry and about the presence of God in the world. ""It's not about religion or about black, white, blue or red,"" she says. ""Spirit and divinity are everywhere. You and I standing here talking, we're holding a service!"" Amen, sister. Amen."
6,PARENTING,Solange Knowles Quit Instagram After Trolls Targeted Her Son,Cavan Sieczkowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/solange-knowles-instagram-trolls_us_5b9d9628e4b03a1dcc89d469,The 27-year-old sat down for an interview with entertainment blog Concrete Loop last week and opened up about how she deals,2013-10-09,"Solange Knowles arrives at the 3.1 Phillip Lim for Target launch event at Spring Studio on Thursday, Sept. 5, 2013 in New York.

She was a user for a brief period of time last year, but the songstress says she had good reason to ditch the photo-sharing app (at least for a while): Trolls were targeting her young son. The 27-year-old sat down for an interview with entertainment blog Concrete Loop last week and opened up about how she deals with negativity online as a person in the public eye. ""I think just because I've been in the industry for so long ... I've always been a part of a very accessible kind of movement of technology,"" she said. ""I was on Twitter very early on. I don't know, a part of me just kind of turns an eye to it, and a part of me really feels like the humanization of artists has really just been stripped down.""Speaking about Instagram, Knowles said: I think one of the reasons I actually went off of Instagram ... is because I would post pictures of my son or of my friends, and they would be criticized. And my whole thing is that I'm completely, fully capable of handling negativity for myself. [But] to put that kind of access to negativity behind people who didn't even ask for it was really troubling to me.The ""Love In the Parking Lot"" singer, whose child is 8 years old, first joined Instagram under the handle @mydamnstagramsss last year and then deleted the account a short time later. She tweeted in July that she had left the site: ""Bye Bye Instagram :) That was short lived, but fun!"" Apparently, she has been Instagramming from another handle, @saintrecords, since July 24, 2012. On Tuesday, she tweeted a link to the account for fans. Her sister, Beyonce, has been careful about sharing images of her 21-month-old daughter, Blue Ivy, on social media. For her Tumblr, Beyonce I Am, the superstar posts only strategically posed photos of the child and doesn't show her full face. Many parents -- famous or not -- grapple with the issue of whether to share pics on social media.Nicole Feliciano, of the blog Mom Trends, chooses not to share any photos of her daughters, 8 and 5. As her kids get older, she is teaching them more about digital sharing. For instance, she explained to her older child that even if you delete something online, it still exists. ""We're trying to use social media education for them as well,"" she told CNN, ""so they know about permanence and about being very responsible with every image that you put up.""  "
