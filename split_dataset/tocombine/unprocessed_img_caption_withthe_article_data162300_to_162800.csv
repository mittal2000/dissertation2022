Sound familiar? Ruffles first launched the flavor a few years ago, but now it's to the MAX.We are very harsh potato chip judges. That being said, we are fans of these. There isn't a ton of onion ring flavor, but the chips do taste like a pretty good onion dip, in chip form. ""You could just dip it in sour cream and it makes its own onion dip,"" said one enthusiastic taster. There's also an evident beer taste as well, sort of the flavor you get when you eat meat that has been braised in booze. The new chips have 10 grams of fat per ounce, compared with seven grams of fat for regular Ruffles.Frito-Lay, which makes Ruffles, said it's serious about marketing these chips to a male audience. ""Onion rings are one of those staple guy get-together foods,"" said Tony Matta, Frito-Lay North America vice president of marketing, in a press release. ""We wanted to incorporate that flavor for guys to share for any impromptu gathering."" The release describes the chips as ""a truly unapologetic snack experience that satisfies man hunger at just about any time."" With all due respect to Matta, beer-battered onion ring potato chips do not automatically equal an impromptu gathering with our crew. Also, our crew would include females. And probably some sour cream. Perhaps some guac. And maybe some actual beer. The chips are available nationwide starting Feb. 26 for a limited time. They will be sold in 2.5-ounce bags for a retail price of $1.49 and 8-ounce bags for a retail price of $4.29."

When they finally settle back in at home, what do they want to cook for themselves? We asked, and they just started telling us! Find out their answers in our series, Homecoming Meals.When you ask an Iron Chef what their ideal Homecoming Meal would be, a simple pasta dish you'll be able to nail in your own home is a pleasant surprise. But when that Iron Chef is Michael Symon, that pasta dish will also include bacon, jalapeño and some great advice about how to not ruin your pasta (spoiler alert: don't rinse it!). Chef Symon is not what we'd call a shrinking violet. In addition to being an Iron Chef, real chef, restaurateur and cooking show host, Symon has found the time to write cookbooks, win awards, make innumerable tv appearances and act as spokesman for Lay's ""Do Us A Flavor"" campaign. Which is why we found it especially endearing that his ideal Homecoming Meal would be whatever tastes good and gets him sitting down with the one he loves as quickly as possible.We love the sound of this recipe almost as much as we love Symon's signature giggle.

Bucatini with Bacon, Tomato and Jalapeño Recipe Courtesy of Michael Symon Serves 4  1 pound bucatini or perciatelli pasta 1 pound bacon, cut into large dice 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1 large jalapeño, seeds and ribs removed, minced 2 cups whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes, chopped ½ cup reserved pasta water 1 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup grated parmesan Salt to taste  In a very large pot, bring 5 quarts of water and 3 tablespoons of salt to boil. When the water is boiling add the pasta and cook until just al dente, about 8 minutes. Remove the pasta from the water and set aside. Do not rinse the pasta under water as it will wash away the starch. Reserve a half cup of pasta water before emptying the pot.  Meanwhile, place a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 10 minutes. Don’t drain off the bacon fat. To this add the garlic and jalapeño and cook for another minute. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the tomatoes, bring to a simmer, and cook for 5 minutes. Add the cooked pasta and reserved pasta water and simmer until the pasta is fully cooked, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the parsley, butter and parmesan. Stir well and serve immediately.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste? Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr. "

Working moms of all stripes were excited last summer when Yahoo! named Marissa Mayer CEO, even as her maternity leave loomed just a few months away. Yes, she soon concerned us fellow working parents when she immediately committed publicly to a two-week maternity leave. But I still had hope. We all knew she had a troubled company to turn around -- maybe her plan was to lead by example with a flexible work schedule?Alas, no. Instead, her plan as announced last week is to lead her workforce back to the last century by banning work-from-home policies across the company. Lisa Belkin called out the new policy in her recent blog The Huffington Post:""Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home,"" says the memo from HR director Jackie Reses, and reprinted by Kara Swisher on WSJ's AllthingsD last night. ""We need to be one Yahoo!, and that starts with physically being together.""This is a tech company, right? One in which everyone is connected 24/7? Just checking. Because Yahoo!, of all companies, should be one that is primed to take advantage of all the productivity, engagement and loyalty gains study after study has found is tied to workplace flexibility. By taking away employees' ability to decide how and when they work, Yahoo! has effectively shot itself in the foot as it limps into the future. Working Mother created this simple infographic, which rounds up all Yahoo! needs to know about the impact of flex on your bottom line. A few weeks ago, I wrote an open letter to a Mr. NoFlex boss, explaining how fear of flex hurts his business. I'll be honest: When I wrote that letter, I imagined writing to someone who hadn't changed his ways in 20 years or so and needed a little help to come into the new millennium -- an era in which 98% of employers now offer some form of flex.   Little did I know I'd have to forward that the same letter to the youngest woman ever to serve as CEO of a Fortune 500 company -- and a fellow working mom to boot. Ms. Mayer, I write you the same thing I wrote ""him"": You have nothing left to fear but fear itself. Give employees the power to control their workday and, I promise, you'll be pleasantly surprised."
3,FOOD & DRINK,Momofuku's Influence Manifests In Its Alumni's Restaurants,Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/momofukus-influence-alumni_us_5b9cda5ee4b03a1dcc82706b,Important restaurants always have alumni who start other acclaimed restaurants.,2013-02-25,"CHANGES SECOND LINE TO REMOVE FERRAN ADRIA- In this Thursday, Nov. 10, 2011 photo, chef David Chang is seen during an interview at Momofuku Noodle Bar in New York. Still only in his 30s, Chang, the son of Korean immigrants, has built a growing restaurant empire. (AP Photo/Diane Bondareff)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cda5e240000300094d94d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bon Appetit recently named Momofuku the most important restaurant in America. Momofuku isn't really one restaurant (it's at least 10 restaurants on two continents), so it wasn't really a fair victory. But anyway, by ""important,"" the magazine's editors, as they explained in the preface to the piece, really meant ""influential."" Yet literary lion Harold Bloom has written many times that poetic influence is determined by poets rather than by critics, publications or scholars, and the same is true in the world of haute cuisine. A poem is only as influential insofar as its readers are inspired to write further poetry and a restaurant is only truly influential if it begets further restaurants. The best way for a restaurant to do so is by training chefs in its kitchens who go off to do great things. The most important restaurants of recent decades have always had large fleets of alumni who go on to start acclaimed restaurants. Chez Panisse birthed Judy Rodger's Zuni Cafe, Paul Grieco's Oliveto and Jonathan Waxman's Barbuto; Le Cirque led to Daniel Boulud's Daniel, Terrance Brennan's Picholine, Bill Telepan's Telepan and David Bouley's Bouley; Bouley spawned Shea Gallante's Ciano, Kurt Gutenbrunner's Wallse and Anita Lo's Annisa. Momofuku chef David Chang himself worked at one of Boulud's restaurants, Cafe Boulud, as well as Tom Colicchio's Craft, another fountain of famous chef-alumni. Momofuku had a slow start on the alumni scale for a very good reason. The empire was expanding so quickly at first that it was easy for Chang to find plum positions for talented employees within the Momofuku family. ""Oh, you're sick of being sous chef at Noodle Bar? No problem! I'm about to open a new high-end restaurant down the street, you can be the chef there"" seemed to be the general mantra. But no matter how happy they are working for other people, most chefs eventually want to strike out on their own, for more creative control and the chance at a bigger paycheck. So Momofuku alumni have started to open restaurants at a faster and faster clip than ever before. Many of the restaurants they've started follow largely in the mold of Momofuku, in that they put bold (often Asian-inflected) flavors and moderate prices above comfy seats and high thread-count tablecloths. Joaquin Baca, Chang's original partner at the Noodle Bar, got the ball rolling by opening up a porky restaurant in Williamsburg called Brooklyn Star. Things got derailed a little when the restaurant suffered a terrible fire a year later, but it reopened, to more praise than ever, in 2011. Ssam Bar veteran Corey Cova followed in his footsteps by heading the kitchen at two well-liked, tiny restaurants in East Harlem, Earl's Bar and Cheese and ABV. The most acclaimed restaurant headed by a Momofuku alum so far is Kevin Pemoulie's Thirty Acres, which opened up in unglamorous Jersey City in April 2012. The fusion food there was remarkable enough to prompt dining critic Pete Wells to file the only official New York Times review of a restaurant in New Jersey in recent memory, and to win the restaurant a spot on this year's list of semifinalists for the James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant.Two more Momofuku alums are opening their own places within the next few months: Peter Serpico and Tien Ho. The former, who helped Chang open his Michelin-bedecked flagship Momofuku Ko, is opening Serpico in Philadelphia in concert with the city's premier restaurateur Stephen Starr. And the latter, who was in charge of Momofuku's midtown outpost Ma Peche for some time, will soon open a French bistro called Montmartre in lower Manhattan. It's too early to say whether any of these restaurants will have the enduring influence of a place like the Zuni Cafe or Bouley, and spawn a new generation of chefs themselves. So Momofuku may or may not end up joining the elite company of restaurants like Chez Panisse and Le Cirque that have famous grandchildren as well as famous children. But this is an impressive crop of new eateries. A sign that David Chang will meet Harold Bloom's test of importance as well as Bon Appetit's."

In Tibet, monks got to view beautiful sculptures carved from Yaks' milk, a sort of Himalayan take on the county fair.In Taiwan, a 60-foot-tall lantern in the shape of an aquatic dragon was the center of a celebration expected to attract over ten million people according to the Taipei Times. Other massive lanterns depicted a phoenix, an elephant and a Pixiu -- a sort of winged lion that protects Feng Shui. The celebrations across Asia were all -- as they traditionally have been -- visually striking, offering travelers a chance to see traditional artforms in radically exaggerated forms.

As of today, over 125,000 videos came back when I searched Harlem Shake on YouTube. It seems everywhere I turn, there's another version popping up. All branches of the military have their version of the pop sensation. University sports teams, high schools and even a group of nursing home patients can be seen bumping to the latest craze. I was with a group of parents the other day, and one of the father's smiled at me to ask, ""What do you think this Harlem Shake thing is all about?""I took a pause to try and gather my thoughts. Trying to live in a world of understanding youth trends and at the same time, consulting people on the outside of that world (parents) is extremely difficult. The question ""What's with the harlem shake?"" today is almost like someone asking, ""So what's with this Inter-web craze?"" back in the late '90s. Of course, the Harlem Shake is going to be a fading fad without anywhere near the same impact as the infrastructure of the Internet, but the metaphor is the same. Sometimes, when you live outside a certain demographic for enough time, the questions people ask are amusing. As I gathered my thoughts on the trendy idea of a YouTube dance, I couldn't help but think about three different core human needs that appeal to us when we call our friends together and say, ""Hey, Let's Youtube our own Harlem Shake.""1. FUN!! Parents love to have fun. Kids love to have fun. College students love to have fun. Dissecting this movement much further really begins to enter into an analysis void of people just smiling together. Everywhere we turn, the news is doom and gloom. We don't have anywhere we can lock arms together and just ENJOY LIFE!! Humans are fashioned to have fun and create stories together. Who doesn't enjoy getting together with people they trust and just have a good time? The Harlem Shake is a vehicle providing a space for people just to have a good time. 2. Togetherness Most recently, I've theorized the biggest issue in our culture today is the loneliness we've all adopted as normal. Today, we live our lives on social media, our biggest relationships sometimes appearing to be with our favorite tech advice. Sure, Facebook, Twitter, Skype and whatever means of communication you enjoy have provided an INCREDIBLE information shift. We are living in an exciting time to connect, but we must be careful not to alienate our most core need ""to know and to be known"" by each other. As we regulate our relationships over a text message, a twitter date or a Facebook profile, we actually loose the ability to look each other in the eye, be in one another's presence and deal with the nuances of being human. It's almost like the movie Wall-E was a prediction of our lives rather than simple animation. The Harlem Shake is a vehicle for us to be together. We do something FUN TOGETHER!!3. A Culture of Celebrity It's probably not as strong of proposal, but I've seen the NEED to be somebody elevated to a narcissistic level over the last 10 years of working with teens. YouTube has provided a place where everyone can be a celebrity if they have a trendy viral-type video. We are living in a time with a generation who longs to being someone special, and our culture says someone special equals something of celebrity status. You don't even really need to make a truck load of money anymorer if you can make a hit video, you can be someone in this world. Closely tied to the economic problems forecasted for the future, we've got to get back to a reality of self. Just because we live in a world with much doesn't mean we're entitled to a world with much. I had a conversation with a potential employee who was frustrated because I couldn't promise a six-figure salary when they graduated from college. That's the world we live in. That's what makes us feel special. That's the demographic graduating from our high schools and universities. If you're not someone of notoriety, you fail. If we can encourage people to get back to a place where they can function with the skill sets they are born to carry out, we'll see more people who are satisfied in the world where they can be who they were made to be. All in all, PARENTS: Don't worry about the Harlem Shake. It's a fun thing for people to do together in a world where they are longing to develop REAL relationships with each other. Just watch and laugh. It's OK!!"

They're also praying for better health -- literally. Gods and goddesses, doctors and nurses, each have a part to play in Japanese health care and nobody laughs if you round out your prescription with a visit to one of Tokyo's famous health shrines. Travelers can join the locals in asking for a little celestial medical insurance of their own with this quick guide to several renowned health shrines. Koganji's magic JizoWash Your Health Cares Away at Koganji Koganji has been drawing hopeful health seekers to Sugamo since 1656. Believers come to pray to the powerful Togenuki Jizo (thorn pulling jizo) statue. This statue is not actually in the act of pulling a thorn. That's just an analogy for any illness, as the enshrined deity 'plucks' pain and suffering from the devoted. Koganji's Jizo does not look like the familiar monk with shaved head, humble guardian of children and travelers. Here, the statue is black, graced with a beautiful headdress and draped garments. He stands outside in the temple forecourt beside a stone basin of clear, cold water and a number of white cloths, neatly folded. People patiently wait in line, often a very long line, to rinse out one of the cloths and rub it on the statue over any area they wish to heal with the Jizo's legendary curative powers.  Lucky cats taking no chances. Inside the temple building, the priests sell small Jizo statues and papers imprinted with his image. Taking these home, worshippers rub them on the afflicted portion of their body or any place they wish to prevent illness. Sugamo is great fun even if you're not a believer. Jizo Dori, the street leading to the temple, is a time-slip back to a much older Tokyo - though its only two stations out of Ikebukuro. As long as you're not fighting the stomach flu, there are a lot of tempting snacks including senbei crackers shaped like the famed statue in lots of flavors both sweet and salty. Seeing red in SugamoOn your way to and from the temple it's hard to miss the big displays of bright red underwear in storefronts. Red is a good luck color all over Asia. In Japan, wearing red underwear supposedly boosts your health luck, especially for circulation! People come to Sugamo from all over to buy them and it certainly brightens up the street - and your bottom. AccessSugamo Station, JR Yamanote Line. Take the main exit out, cross the big intersection and walk to your right, past McDonald's.  The road to good health is actually quite scenic...Gojo Tenjin Helps the Medicine Go DownHard to imagine this shrine in Ueno Park was once in the thick of a battle between the samurai of the Tokugawa Shogunate and reformers under the Emperor Meiji's banner. Swordsmen fought right in Gojo Tenjin's courtyard amid exploding cannonballs from the artillery the reformers had secured.Ironically, the shrine is known as a Shinto place of healing, dedicated to the gods of medicine and learning. It has stood - more or less - on this spot for 1890 years and was considered one of the top three medicine shrines of old Edo. The Japan Pharmaceutical Association certainly takes the place seriously. Gojo Tenjin blesses their annual gathering in October. This is also the go-to shrine for students hoping to enter medical school or the pharmaceutical department of medical universities. A medicine festival, Iyaku Matsuri, is still held on the tenth of every month. 'Matsuri' is misleading. Nowadays it is a private ceremony held within the main shrine. Desperation or faith, visitors devotedly bring their own or a relative's medicine, paying the priests for a heavenly power-up.Access: Ueno Station, JR exit for Ueno Park.  Zojoji, broadcasting your health prayers to the godsZojoji TempleThe first Zojoji was constructed in 1393 and moved to this site at the end of the 1500s. Super Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu believed Zojoji's black Amida Buddha (currently housed in the Ankokuden side hall) helped power him to victory in uniting Japan. Beyond a massive red wooden gate, this huge temple stands at the end of a stone walkway wide enough to park a Boeing 777. Zojoji is not shy about advertising its holy curative powers. During the winter, a calligraphic signboard by the main gate encourages visitors to roll up and give the temple's Muku-Byo (remove sickness) Sokusai (ceremony) a try to keep them healthy all year long. For a price, of course. If you can't afford the ten-thousand yen fee for the full ceremony, kenko mamori (health charms) are for sale to the right of the main altar. At only 500 yen, they're around the same price as a bottle of aspirin. I asked the young priest at the booth about the charm's effectiveness against this year's flu. With a quick smile, he gave me the Japanese equivalent of, ""Well, it couldn't hurt!"" Zojoji website. Onarimon Shiba Dai Jingu, just a couple of blocks from Zojoji gate, has a long-standing reputation for its ability to fight off colds. Very long. The shrine was established in 1005 during the Heian period. Shiba Dai Jingu was often called the 'Ise of Kanto' since two of the gods from holiest of holy Ise Grand Shrine are also enshrined here. For believers, Shiba's one-two punch includes a prayer at the shrine altar and purchasing a 500 yen health charm to take home. However, the shrine's heavenly mandate also encompass a larger menu of illness-specific charms. Health charms Going into or getting over an operation? They've got a charm for that! Trouble sleeping or breathing? One for that, too. Stress and nervous exhaustion as well, plus another to boost your immune system. In a spiritual sense, this shrine has visitors' health concerns well covered!Access For Zojoji and Dai Jingu: Onarimon Station, Mita line, A4 exit. Of course Japanese don't depend on faith alone. Visiting the doctor borders on a national mania with the average citizen cluttering up medical waiting rooms around thirteen or fourteen times a year! But they are also careful to tuck a health charm in their wallet, just in case...These are just a few of the many health shrines and temples in town. Go to my website for more info/access."

But if you're like me, you may have found at some point in your life that following what you thought was your heart got you into trouble. For example, you might have felt guided by your desire to eat another piece of chocolate cake, but then you felt bad afterward. Or you were tingling and your heart beating fast about dating a certain guy, but it turned out to be a bad experience. Why? Because your mind can easily confuse an emotional pull for heart intuition, and we follow that allure instead. It takes practice to discern the difference.What signals are you listening to more? I often thought I was following my heart only to discover I was really just following my desire. For example, I got into a relationship that felt very romantic, but the romantic love feeling and my hormones overrode my heart's whispering: ""I don't know about this."" I learned through trial and error that the lure of romance isn't always what the heart really wants, which is heart resonance. Heart resonance is more fulfilling and less of a roller coaster ride. Likewise, your heart may be talking to you when you hear, ""I don't know if I should take the job, even though it pays a lot."" The heart often speaks to us quietly and with common sense. The mind tends to rationalize our desires and reactions. To help you distinguish between how your mind might sound vs. your heart, here are some examples in the same situations:  Driving. Mind: How long is this going to take? Damn this traffic! Stupid driver, slowing everyone down. When are they going to widen this road? You pay taxes but nothing happens. She just cut in deliberately! (Give her the finger.) Heart: Traffic isn't going to move until it moves -- no use getting upset. Turn on the CD player and listen to some music. That woman is really upset. I'll send her some heart.Home. Mind: Why is this place such a mess? He just doesn't care! Can't stand those kids not picking up. They don't give a damn about me. Where's the remote? Why isn't dinner done? Don't look at me like that! (Blow up.) Heart: I really don't like the house messy. We need a better plan for keeping the house in order. Let me arrange a talk with Stan and the kids after dinner. No TV or distractions until we've created a plan -- with consequences if one of us doesn't do what we agreed to and rewards if we do. It could be fun if we do it together.Work. Mind: Who does she think she is? It's not fair she gets the good assignments and I'm left with crap -- makes me furious! He's always sucking up to the boss. There's no way to keep up -- that damn printer keeps jamming! (Slam and break the printer tray.) Heart: Things are tough. Everyone's running fast and trying to just keep their job. I need to keep my cool and not drain my energy, not get into the backbiting, make sure I take my breaks. My intuition says it would be a good idea to sincerely get to know some of these people better, maybe have lunch once in a while.The supermarket. Mind: Why don't they have more cashiers? They keep us standing here like cattle -- they know we have busy lives. And the prices you have to pay! They're just greedy. That incompetent mother can't keep her kid's hands off the candy -- someone should teach the brat a lesson (head shaking, blood pressure rising). Heart: I really didn't plan this right. The checker looks like she's been working 12 hours -- I'll send her some care and a smile. Let me find a good magazine on the news rack I can read while I'm waiting.  In the Mind examples, judgments and reactions are in control and you feel justified being judgmental and angry. The Heart, though, is decidedly different -- softer and simpler. It might take courage to listen to your heart because what it suggests often seems too easy. It might say, ""Just let it go"" or ""It's no big deal,"" and you may be afraid you're going to let someone get away with something or that the other person is going to walk all over you. It's like two different radio stations, the mind and the heart. When you tune into the heart station, your attitude adjusts and you find responses that are much more satisfying to you and better for the whole.As I have learned to balance my emotional nature and clear unresolved issues by listening to my heart and practicing heart qualities of self-compassion, compassion for others, forgiveness, appreciation and kindness, I have progressively been able to distinguish intuitive heart feelings from my mental and emotional preferences. A way to most effectively tune into your heart intuition is by first getting into heart coherence. The Heart Lock-In technique is designed to help you generate and sustain coherence and distinguish the difference between your head voice and your heart:Step 1: Shift your attention to the area of your heart and breathe slowly and deeply.Step 2: Activate and sustain a genuine feeling of appreciation or care for someone or something in your life.Step 3:Radiate these feelings of care and appreciation toward yourself and others for five minutes or longer.When you catch your mind wandering, simply refocus your attention on the heart area and reconnect with feelings of care and appreciation or other heart qualities. Notice how this extended radiation of care has affected your body, emotions and thinking. As you complete your Heart Lock-In, be receptive to your heart's intuitive guidance. Is there anything your heart would like you to know in this moment? Write down whatever you quietly sense. It is nature's design that you get your head in sync with your deeper heart intent. You can find a new type of fun in listening to your heart as your command center. The fun is gaining back your power not to go back to the mechanical way -- the old way of the head. When you do fall back, you replace feeling bad about it with feeling compassion for yourself. Compassion will quickly shift you back into coherence. You stop wasting your energy judging yourself or others. You stop those painful feelings churning inside. You release your own energy and power to do the things that matter most to you. You preserve your health and promote happiness in your relationships. While things still will happen that are extremely unfair or unkind and cause painful feelings, you choose how you are going to handle your emotions. Your choices make all the difference.

Classes are led by certified trainers and are accessible to anyone around the globe with a webcam and an Internet connection.""It's that ability to join in on something last-minute and also to explore something new,"" said Ann Scott Plante, co-founder of San Francisco-based company Wello.Like traditional classes, the instructors in the video classes, which have three to five students, offer motivation and feedback. Users can join an existing class, or organize a new one with friends.Students can see a video feed of each other in the app, along with a feed of the instructor, who can provide feedback to them during the class.""Instead of watching a static video that could get boring, or isn't necessarily built for you, we thought we would give people the opportunity to meet with a real person who would spend the whole workout with you and correct your form,"" Plante said.Trainers on the platform are professionally certified in the United States and their experience and reviews can be viewed online before booking a class.Plante said that by comparison to a traditional in-person class, trainers in the video class give more verbal instructions to make it easier to follow along and because they cannot physically adjust the students.Although trainers can offer personal fitness classes with a video calling service such as Skype, Plante said the scheduling, payment and review features of Wello make it appealing for both instructors and users looking for a workout.Wello, is available on the web with classes starting at under $10 per class. The company, which launched in July 2012, is working on iPad and television apps.(Reporting by Natasha Baker in Toronto; Editing by Patricia Reaney and Eric Beech)"

(Photo by Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cda6b2100003000c54aa0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We're mad at Ina Garten.The thing that makes (or perhaps, as we'll show in a moment, made) her great is that she's (or perhaps was) classy. While her fellow TV chefs were stripping down for Playboy and encouraging watchers to make Kwanzaa cakes using corn nuts and packaged angel food mix, she kept floating through her show, year after year, cooing tips for home cooking that was refined without being fussy. She wrote cookbooks that sell well and are Garten's personal life always seemed elegant, prosperous and low-key. The former nuclear policy wonk and her successful businessman husband Jeffrey Garten constantly host dinner parties at their sumptuous East Hamptons home. They even have a perfect New Year's ritual! So the bottom line is that we have pretty high expectations for Ina. Higher, even, than for some other chefs we fundamentally respect, like Mario Batali or Wolfgang Puck, to say nothing of chefs we don't respect, who shall remain nameless. That's why we got so angry when we heard that she had started selling a line of frozen dinners. The ""Barefoot Contessa Sauté Dinners For Two"" sell for $8 or $9 a piece at places like Safeway and Wal-Mart and come in flavors such as shrimp scampi and tequila lime chicken. We thought Ina could do no wrong, but that sounds pretty wrong. It's not like she's been untainted by commerce so far -- her books are huge sellers, and she sells mixes for donuts and cakes and the such -- but come on... tequila lime chicken? That's the stuff of Chili's.The news was first reported at the beginning of February, in Undercurrent News, but we were hoping if we covered our ears for a while, Ina would change her normally infallible mind and call the whole thing off. But the meals were slated to go on sale this past weekend, and, though we haven't tried them ourselves, we fear the worst. Have any of you readers gotten a taste? If so, can you put our fears to the test, and tell us that Ina has managed, despite all the odds, to do frozen meals perfectly? Please?"

Or, more appropriately...coming up.According to TMZ, the Dolby Theatre lobby in Los Angeles flooded due to a leak in the bathroom. The incident happened just minutes before the show was about to start and quickly made its way to the internet, thanks to Twitpics taken of the staff cleaning up the mess with brooms and vacuums. Entertainment Weekly's Lynette Rice posted a photo on Twitter and wrote ""Flood at the Oscars! Great Day to be a star.""And while the LA City Fire department couldn't confirm what caused the leak, there are suggestions that it was due to a toilet. Perhaps a Lorraine Schwartz jewel or some sequin beads clogged the loo? Or could it have been due to, well, let's just say a nervous stomach? Either way we know it wasn't ""Argo"" producer Grant Heslov, who told TMZ, he personally did not have any bathroom problems. But if you ever find yourself in a similar predicament, you can a contact a professional plumber to help you, or follow the directions in Howcast's video on how to fix a clogged toilet. We've also compiled a list of ways to clean up a home after a flood has occurred. Click through our slideshow to see photos of those whose night could not be ruined by some nasty toilet water.
