You've got a blog set up and you're writing furiously, posting every week to get more attention for your brand. Everything you've read tells you that content marketing is both cost-efficient and effective for building a brand reputation and getting more customers, but there's no immediate gauge to tell you whether or not your content is working the way you want it to. Fortunately, there are several different tools and strategies you can use to measure whether or not your content is getting the job done:1. Social Shares. If you're sharing your content on social media (as you should be), you can use your audience's reaction to your posts as a gauge of your content's effectiveness. For example, if you find that your posts are attracting multiple likes, favorites, and shares, you can rest assured that your content is working well. If instead you find dead air, it could be an indication that something is wrong.2. User Comments. On your blog, there should be an area where people can leave comments on your individual posts and either start or contribute to discussions. If you find that people are generally interested enough to comment on your work, it's a positive sign that your content is working. 3. Increased Traffic. Log into Google Analytics to monitor the growth of your site's incoming traffic. If you find that your total traffic numbers--especially from organic, social, and referral sources--are increasing with the number of posts you offer, it means your content is doing its job.4. Higher Ranks. The more quality material you write, the higher your site should rank in search engines like Google. While you shouldn't obsess over the minutiae of individual ranks, do pay attention to the general trend--it should be gradually moving up. 5. Cumulative Results. Remember that in order to measure the effectiveness of your content accurately, you'll need to look at the cumulative effects. The first month may show little to no results, while the second and third months only show minimal momentum. But by the sixth month and beyond, you should start seeing consistent returns. If you find, after applying these tests and strategies, that your content isn't as effective as you'd like it to be, take the time to reevaluate your strategy and rebuild from the ground up. Try to understand the failure point of your content: have you failed to fully understand your target audience? Were you inconsistent in voice or publishing frequency? Were you leveraging the wrong channels? Content marketing is an ongoing learning process, so make an adjustment and keep moving forward.

It's important to us to believe that we are, but it can sometimes be hard to know. We are both lucky enough to work in professions where the fundamental goal is to help others. But, like most people, we have our days where fundamental goals feel a little abstract - days of bureaucratic circling or perverse consequences or feelings of flat out frustration and ineffectuality. Sometimes, it's hard to answer that gnawing internal question: ""what have I contributed to the world today?"" A girl in Madagascar shows the deworming tablets provided to her by the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, one of the most effective charities in the world.Recently, we've found a way to answer that question with a little more confidence, a little less sheepishness, and significantly reduced reliance on the worthiness of our intentions. We took a pledge to donate at least ten per cent of our incomes, for the rest of our lives, to the world's most effective charities. To do this, we became members of Giving What We Can, a charity that helps us find the most effective places to donate, and keeps us on track with our pledge. They're part of a movement that's about making the world a better place as effectively as possible. The conceptual rigour and empirical evidence that underpins the movement is so important to us precisely because it allows us to know, for once, that we are doing something 'good'. By giving to charities that have proven to be effective, we get more moral certainty in our lives. Even on the difficult days, and in a hopelessly complex world - and holding some doubts about the effectiveness and efficiency of some organizations that frequently ask for donations - we know that we have helped a small number of people that are in real need. We know that the welfare benefits of this transfer to the ultimate recipient will greatly outweigh any possible welfare cost to us. Because of the evidence-based approach that Giving What We Can supports, we aren't worried that the money was squandered or used for things that don't matter. Knowing these things simply makes us happier. There are, of course, debates about whether doing something for others to make yourself happy counts as altruism. We'll let you decide. It's certainly true that what we are doing doesn't feel like a big sacrifice: our giving has only the most marginal impact on our material standard of living - which (as for the vast majority of us lucky enough to live in the developed world) remains among the highest of anyone in human history.Our advice? Don't ask why you should join Giving What You Can. Listen to this interview with Giving What We Can founder Toby Ord here, or one of these talks by moral philosopher Peter Singer here and here. Read a bit more about it. And then see if you can honestly think of a good reason why you shouldn't join. It's a great way to be sure you are making a positive difference in the lives of others--and it will probably make you happier too.

Maybe you have a good idea. Maybe you have a handful of potential partners. Maybe you keep finding yourself daydreaming about the potential of owning your own business. Whatever the case, entrepreneurship is calling you, and you aren't sure whether you should keep plugging away in your safer, more stable lifestyle, or risk it all for a chance at something great. There's no single way to tell whether you're ready to start your own business, but if you notice more than one of these five signs, it's probably time for you to venture into the world of entrepreneurship: 1. You find yourself thinking about entrepreneurship often. If you find yourself constantly daydreaming about the prospect of entrepreneurship, that desire isn't going to fade anytime soon. It will keep eating away at you until you finally pull the trigger--so why wait? 2. You're passionate about your work, but not your job. Think about the work you do. If you're passionate about some of your responsibilities and duties, but not your specific job, it means this isn't the right environment for you. Working under your own direction is the only solution. 3. You want to lead. If you have a strong desire to lead others under a common effort, but you don't want to report to someone even higher up, entrepreneurship is the best outlet for you. 4. You have a great idea. If you have a solid idea for a product or service, and you know it has serious potential, that's a pretty good place to start developing yourself as an entrepreneur. Just be sure to do your competitive and market research before you plunge into things.5. You know the risks, and they haven't deterred you. Many people love the idea of owning their own business until they start looking at the personal, financial, and professional risks involved. If you know the risks, and they still haven't stopped you, it's time to start your own business. These signs should be able to help point you in the right direction, but ultimately the decision is up to you. Trust your gut instincts--if it feels like the right time, it probably is, and nobody can stop you from achieving your goals except you.Jose Vasquez is a serial entrepreneur and tech enthusiast dedicated to helping startup technology companies get the direction and momentum they need to succeed.

It is the first European tour the orchestra has been on since Nézet-Séguin became musical director of the Fabulous Philadelphians three years ago.  The Fab Phils in Europe (courtesy Phila.Orch) The orchestra was not resting up before the journey, they concluded their 2014-15 season here with two of their most vibrant programs. Nézet-Séguin collaborated with opera director Kevin Newbury for a full re-staging of Leonard Bernstein's MASS that marshaled area singers, musicians, actors and dancers to make it an truly musical ecumenical event, some 250 performers joining forces for the production. With a short rehearsal cycle, it all came together, however bumpily, for the four sold - out performances and for all intents and purposed was a 'communal happening' if not a musical season highlight.   In 1971, by all accounts, Bernstein poured his musical soul into the work with a mosaic of symphonic and choral structures, Broadway songs and rock elements. Bernstein was also weighing in on social issues at the time as the Vietnam War and social unrest dominated the news. His narrative of a religious leader 'The Celebrant' loosing his religion in the face of congregants who see the church as disconnected to the modern world.

In 1971, by all accounts, Bernstein poured his musical soul into the work with a mosaic of symphonic and choral structures, Broadway songs and rock elements.

It would be indescribably hard to do the right thing and speak up. But as a mom to a daughter, it would be impossible not to.",2015-05-28,"Josh Duggar, executive director of FRC Action, speaks in favor the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act at the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock, Ark., Friday, Aug. 29, 2014. (AP Photo/Danny Johnston)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb67457240000500056c44d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By now, you've probably heard about the Duggar dirty laundry that all over the Internet. In a nutshell, Josh Duggar, the oldest son of the ""19 Kids and Counting"" Duggar family, has admitted to molesting several young girls as a teenager. In case you missed the story, you can read In Touch's take on it here.I have always liked the Duggars in a fascinated, ""damn, that's a lot of kids to give birth to, Michelle,"" kind of way. I've watched the show here and there, although I've never been what you'd call an avid follower. I thought they seemed like nice people and although I don't agree with their belief system or their politics, I enjoyed tuning in from time to time. Maybe it was my fascination with the large amount of hairspray Jim Bob used or the epic size of their laundry room. Who knows?I always rolled my eyes at the Judgy McJudgersons that liked to spout the ""too many kids"" litany. I think family size is a matter for... well, for the family concerned and although 19 kids would make me want to sit in a corner drinking straight vodka and shredding Kleenex, I don't think I get to say how many is too many for another family.There's a lot of hate being fired at Josh Duggar on the Internet today. Maybe he deserves it. Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he's been waiting for the other shoe to drop for years and maybe he's a little bit relieved that he doesn't have to worry and wonder when someone is going to learn his dirty secrets.It seems everyone has an opinion on the Duggars. TLC has cancelled the show. Josh Duggar has resigned his position with the Family Research Council and has made a public apology, admitting to ""acting inexcusably.""But, what about the girls?Who are they? Did they get help? Do their hearts bear scars about being fondled by a teenage boy when they were as young as 5 years old?Are there more girls who haven't been identified or who didn't speak up? Josh Duggar's actions were covered up and hushed up. He might have come clean with his parents, but no effort was made to get him any sort of professional help. The incidents were neatly swept under the rug, probably festering in the minds of the secret-keepers like ticking time bombs.But, what about the girls?Will more step forward in the coming days and say ""me too?"" Will the knowledge of ""it's not just me"" cause someone else to raise their hand? Time will tell.Someone touched me in my sleep when I was 14. I woke up when I felt unwelcome hands on my breasts through my nightgown. I rolled over and crossed my arms tightly over my chest, pretending I never woke up. Mercifully, it stopped. The hands belonged to a boy my own age... the brother of a friend.The next morning, I told an adult, not one of my parents but an adult I trusted.""It's not a big deal. Just forget about it. I'm sure it was nothing and I bet it won't happen again.""14-year-old me believed these words: It's not a big deal. Being touched when you don't want to be touched is a big deal, and 48-year-old me knows that. I never forgot about that night and while I don't want to minimize it, it hasn't caused me any lingering damage. I don't think of that night often, but the Duggar's story has brought the memory to the surface.And, I wonder about the girls.At 14, I knew what was up. I knew boys liked boobs. I knew enough about the birds and the bees to know what was going on and looking back, I consider myself lucky that I made it stop with the simple gesture of moving my body away.Younger me wouldn't have been that savvy. That nameless, faceless 5-year-old that Josh Duggar put his hands on... she's grown up with the memory of someone putting his hands on her private parts. Did someone tell her it was no big deal and to forget about it? Did she forget?I have better things to do than throw darts at Josh Duggar. If the media reports are true, he's healed and moved on and his past isn't a surprise to the people who really care about him.As I said, I never was a Duggar superfan. But should TLC ever pick up their show again, I won't watch it. As a mom to sons, I can only imagine the terrible pain I would face it one of my boys told me they'd done something to hurt an innocent young girl. It would be indescribably hard to do the right thing and speak up. But as a mom to a daughter, it would be impossible not to.I feel sorry for Michelle. As a mom, I can't imagine the pain this must cause.But, I wonder about the girls.Jill writes about adoption, motherhood and midlife on her blog, Ripped Jeans and Bifocals.

8,RELIGION,"The Impact of the Jewish People on Humanity, as Traced by Scholars Throughout Time","Dr. Michael Laitman, ContributorProfessor of Ontology",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-impact-of-the-jewish-_b_7450670.html,"When Abraham first discovered the method of connection, he told about it to whomever would listen, and those who joined him became the first truly connected people.",2015-05-28,2015-05-27-1432734564-9372481-babylonhuffpostimpact.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-27-1432734564-9372481-babylonhuffpostimpact-thumb.JPG,"When Abraham first discovered the method of connection, he told about it to whomever would listen, and those who joined him became the first truly connected people. Those people then went to Egypt, and finally emerged from it in much greater numbers, an entire nation. That nation received the method of connection, namely the Torah, and connected as one to provide the world with an example of unity. In the First Temple, the Jewish nation achieved its highest level of connection.. From there the nation began to decline until they were exiled to Babylon. When they returned to the Land of Israel, the majority of the Jewish nation chose to stay in the Diaspora and assimilate.This is how the circulation of the method of connection began. When people who had learned to connect above their self-interest mingled with those who have never had such thoughts, those noble ideas began to percolate to the host societies and help instigate more humane cultures. Notions of universalism and humanism began to take hold in people's minds.During the renaissance, several renowned scholars maintained that the Greeks adopted at least some of their concepts from the Jews, in this case specifically from Kabbalah. Johannes Reuchlin (1455-1522), for example, the political counselor to the Chancellor, wrote in De Arte Cabbalistica (On the Art of Kabbalah): ""Nevertheless, his [Pythagoras'] preeminence derived not from the Greeks, but again from the Jews. ...He himself was the first to convert the name Kabbalah, unknown to the Greeks, into the Greek name philosophy."" In 1918, French pastor, Charles Wagner, was quoted as having written, ""None of the resplendent names in history--Egypt, Athens, Rome--can compare in eternal grandeur with Jerusalem. For Israel has given to mankind the category of holiness. Israel alone has known the thirst for social justice, and that inner saintliness which is the source of justice."" More recently, Christian historian Paul Johnson wrote in A History of the Jews: ""The Jewish impact on humanity has been protean. In antiquity they were the great innovators in religion and morals. In the Dark Ages and early medieval Europe they were still an advanced people transmitting scarce knowledge and technology. Gradually they were pushed from the van and fell behind, by the end of the eighteenth century they were seen as a bedraggled and obscurantist rearguard in the march of civilized humanity. But then came an astonishing second burst of creativity. Breaking out of the ghettos, they once more transformed human thinking, this time in the secular sphere. Much of the mental furniture of the modern world too is of Jewish fabrication."" Similarly, In The Gifts of the Jews: How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels, author Thomas Cahill, former director of religious publishing at Doubleday, describes the Jews' contribution to the world, which began during the exile in Babylon. In his words, ""The Jews started it all--and by 'it' I mean so many of the things we care about, the underlying values that make all of us, Jew and Gentile, believer and aethiest, tick. Without the Jews, we would see the world through different eyes, hear with different ears, even feel with different feelings ... We would think with a different mind, interpret all our experiences differently, draw different conclusions from the things that befall us. And we would set a different course for our lives.""  Interestingly, some renown Jewish leaders also wrote about the spreading (and spoiling) of Jewish wisdom after the ruin of the First Temple. Rabbi Shmuel Bernstein of Sochatchov, for example, wrote, ""The Greeks had the wisdom of philosophy, which originated from the writings of King Solomon that have come to their possession after the ruin of the First Temple. However, they were spoiled by them with subtractions, additions, and substitutions until false views mingled with them. And yet, the wisdom itself is good, but parts of the bad have mingled with it."" Baal HaSulam wrote similarly in ""The Wisdom of Kabbalah and Philosophy,"" ""Sages of Kabbalah observe philosophic theology and complain that they have stolen the upper shell of their wisdom, which Plato and his Greek predecessors had acquired while studying with the disciples of the prophets in Israel. They have stolen basic elements from the wisdom of Israel and wore a cloak that is not their own."" The Legacy of the JewsThe Jews that remained in Babylon after the ruin of the First Temple disappeared, leaving no trace but the notions they had bequeathed to their hosts. Later, when the Second Temple was ruined, the whole of the Jewish people exiled and introduced the world to two tenets that were to become the basis of all three predominant, aptly named ""Abrahamic"" religions: ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" and monotheism, meaning that there is only one God, one force governing the world. These notions are paramount to the success of humanity because when understood correctly, the former defines the mode by which we will achieve this beneficial connection among us--through loving others, and not kin, but our neighbors, meaning strangers--and the latter defines the essence of our attainment once we are connected--the singular force of reality.Accordingly, Professor T.R. Glover from Cambridge University wrote in The Ancient World, ""It is strange that the living religions of the world all build on religious ideas derived from the Jews."" Likewise, Herman Rauschning, a German Conservative Revolutionary who briefly joined the Nazis before breaking up with them, wrote in, The Beast from the Abyss: ""Judaism, nevertheless ... is an inalienable component of our Christian Western civilization, the eternal 'call to Sinai' against which humanity again and again rebels.""  ---------------------------------------------- Johannes Reuchlin, De Arte Cabbalistica (Hagenau, Germany: Tomas Anshelm, March, 1517), 126.

This was first reported by Reuters in 2013.Banks will also be looked at in the investigation, authorities said on Wednesday, though it was too early to say whether there had been any wrongdoing.The U.S. indictment alleged that the defendants relied heavily on the U.S. banking system to avoid detection, in often complex schemes with fake invoices and numbered accounts, at banks across the globe.In one case, a teller at a JPMorgan Chase branch on New York's Broadway said she had asked somebody for his driver's license when he wanted to deposit 7,500 euros, which at the time translated to an amount just above the reporting threshold.The person then asked to be handed back 500 euros, which lowered the sum to $9,336.60. Earlier that day, a similar amount had been deposited at JPMorgan in Queens. The following day, another 7,000 euros was deposited at the Broadway branch.Daryll Warner in his guilty plea admitted that he had deliberately broken up deposits into amounts of less than $10,000 to avoid the reporting requirements.JPMorgan declined comment. Wells Fargo and Bank of America did not immediately return a request for comment. Citi has said it has cooperated with Justice. (Reporting by Douwe Miedema; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"

I recently got the opportunity to interview the founders of Adventure Bucket List, a startup that aims to empower travellers, allowing them to discover and book things before they arrive by aggregating all the adventure activities out there into one website. They also provide activity providers with an extensive network so that travelers can discover their offerings more easily. The three founders Ryan Stobie (CEO), Blake Pridham (COO) and Rita LeBlanc (Customer and Relationships Manager) all graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2014 before deciding to jump full-force into Adventure Bucket List(ABL). The ABL Team showing some swagThey recently had a soft launch of their booking software in specific regions and have been rapidly on boarding companies. They plan to continue expanding to new places through both partner travel ties and by creating their own market place for travel activities. They have been making waves in the Canada startup scene, having won multiple competitions like the UBC Entrepreneur Boot Camp, the Vancouver Startup Showdown and the Plug and Play Tech Center Fall Expo 2014. The Travel Startups Incubator has also invested in them as well. How the trio got into entrepreneurship  Everything started when the trio all entered the same entrepreneurship pitch competition back in 2014, where Ryan ended up winning first place and Blake was awarded runner-up. After Blake and Rita showed interest in joining Ryan, the Adventure Bucket List team was born. At the same time, all three founders were very entrepreneurial early on, each one of them recalling different moments in the past where they tried starting their own business.Blake started out by sharing, ""When I used to competitively ski, I was sharpening and waxing my skis all the time. I knew people who would go to ski shops to get their skis sharpened, but those shops would charge up to $50 and never actually did a good job. So I put up an ad at my local ski hill to sharpen and wax people's skis for $25. Next thing I knew I had dozens of people calling me and indirectly had started my first business.""Rita also shared, ""Walking door-to-door selling Girl Scout cookies when I was 8 years old, I found it to be quite fun and rewarding. From then on I was always looking for unique ways to work on my own. I started selling jewellery at craft fairs, detailing cars, walking dogs, and picking wild berries on the mountains behind my house to sell at the farmers markets."" CEO Ryan Stobie pitching at the Plug and Play ShowdownFinally, Ryan shared, ""I have been interested in starting my own company since a very young age. The challenge and the rush associated with starting a company has always appealed to me. The tipping point for this was when I came up with the idea for Adventure Bucket List and how it could help people traveling around the world. When an idea comes to you and you are so passionate and it is literally all you think about, it seems irrational to not pursue it.""The Entrepreneurship Journey  One of the most memorable moments for the three young founders was when they won the Startup Show Down in Vancouver, where the Plug and Play Tech Center was looking for startups to join their summer accelerator program. This was the key that helped the Adventure Bucket List team really accelerate their growth because Plug and Play offered investment money and 4 months of mentorship and networking in Silicon Valley.Rita shared, ""We felt like those people who get their names called on The Price Is Right, except that we weren't just winning a car. Our lives actually changed that day because we got our first significant investment and validation that this idea was really worth something. ""Ryan also shared the joys of seeing and using the Adventure Bucket List online software for the first time. He shared, ""No one knows how much time goes into that initial launch. It was so rewarding to see it materialize.""Blake added, ""Getting our first VC firm to invest in the company was also an amazing day. We had been fund raising for a few months and were starting to question our abilities a bit but kept our head down and pushed forward. I was just wrapping up a call and Ryan came up to me to tell me that we got the investment."" Group photo of the Adventure Bucket List team with the rest of the winners of the Plug and Play ExpoStartup Challenges - ""Running a startup is a bit of a roller coaster""  Blake started out by talking about all the highs and lows of running a company. But he also emphasized the importance of perseverance and remaining positive. He shared, ""It is critical that you persevere and remain positive every step of the way because your team feeds off of your energy and the culture you establish. You can't let one little hiccup affect you nor can you let one win allow you to get too far ahead of yourself.""Another big challenge that the Adventure Bucket List team faced early on was the fact that none of them had a technical background to build their software. All three of them were business people. However, after a lot of searching and patience, they were eventually able to find a team of developers. Rita shared, ""we have built up an amazing team of developers who we get along with so well and with whom we share so many common interests. It's great to be able to take the night off after a busy week and spend time as friends.""Lessons and Advice to Aspiring Entrepreneurs  Ryan started out by emphasizing the importance of having a thick skin and being able to rise up after being turned down. He shared, ""Get used to hearing the word no. It will become your new best friend. One of the big differentiators between startups that make it and ones that fold is the level of persistence in the face of rejection. If a potential investor does not fully understand what you are solving or competitors seem to pop up, these types of things cannot stop you from building your company.""At the same time, Rita talked about the importance of finding key advisors and mentors who have been in your shoes before. She said, ""It's extremely important to be open; share you ideas and ask questions. Find people in your industry who have been through this process and they can help you succeed.""All three founders have their feet set in growing Adventure Bucket List and really improving the quality of life of their friends and people around the world. There's definitely a lot of promise for these three young and entrepreneurial individuals and the rest of the Adventure Bucket List team.

They plan to continue expanding to new places through both partner travel ties and by creating their own market place for travel activities. They have been making waves in the Canada startup scene, having won multiple competitions like the UBC Entrepreneur Boot Camp, the Vancouver Startup Showdown and the Plug and Play Tech Center Fall Expo 2014. The Travel Startups Incubator has also invested in them as well. How the trio got into entrepreneurship  Everything started when the trio all entered the same entrepreneurship pitch competition back in 2014, where Ryan ended up winning first place and Blake was awarded runner-up. After Blake and Rita showed interest in joining Ryan, the Adventure Bucket List team was born. At the same time, all three founders were very entrepreneurial early on, each one of them recalling different moments in the past where they tried starting their own business.Blake started out by sharing, ""When I used to competitively ski, I was sharpening and waxing my skis all the time. I knew people who would go to ski shops to get their skis sharpened, but those shops would charge up to $50 and never actually did a good job. So I put up an ad at my local ski hill to sharpen and wax people's skis for $25. Next thing I knew I had dozens of people calling me and indirectly had started my first business.""Rita also shared, ""Walking door-to-door selling Girl Scout cookies when I was 8 years old, I found it to be quite fun and rewarding. From then on I was always looking for unique ways to work on my own. I started selling jewellery at craft fairs, detailing cars, walking dogs, and picking wild berries on the mountains behind my house to sell at the farmers markets."" CEO Ryan Stobie pitching at the Plug and Play ShowdownFinally, Ryan shared, ""I have been interested in starting my own company since a very young age. The challenge and the rush associated with starting a company has always appealed to me. The tipping point for this was when I came up with the idea for Adventure Bucket List and how it could help people traveling around the world. When an idea comes to you and you are so passionate and it is literally all you think about, it seems irrational to not pursue it.""The Entrepreneurship Journey  One of the most memorable moments for the three young founders was when they won the Startup Show Down in Vancouver, where the Plug and Play Tech Center was looking for startups to join their summer accelerator program. This was the key that helped the Adventure Bucket List team really accelerate their growth because Plug and Play offered investment money and 4 months of mentorship and networking in Silicon Valley.Rita shared, ""We felt like those people who get their names called on The Price Is Right, except that we weren't just winning a car. Our lives actually changed that day because we got our first significant investment and validation that this idea was really worth something. ""Ryan also shared the joys of seeing and using the Adventure Bucket List online software for the first time. He shared, ""No one knows how much time goes into that initial launch. It was so rewarding to see it materialize.""Blake added, ""Getting our first VC firm to invest in the company was also an amazing day. We had been fund raising for a few months and were starting to question our abilities a bit but kept our head down and pushed forward. I was just wrapping up a call and Ryan came up to me to tell me that we got the investment."" Group photo of the Adventure Bucket List team with the rest of the winners of the Plug and Play ExpoStartup Challenges - ""Running a startup is a bit of a roller coaster""  Blake started out by talking about all the highs and lows of running a company. But he also emphasized the importance of perseverance and remaining positive. He shared, ""It is critical that you persevere and remain positive every step of the way because your team feeds off of your energy and the culture you establish. You can't let one little hiccup affect you nor can you let one win allow you to get too far ahead of yourself.""Another big challenge that the Adventure Bucket List team faced early on was the fact that none of them had a technical background to build their software. All three of them were business people. However, after a lot of searching and patience, they were eventually able to find a team of developers. Rita shared, ""we have built up an amazing team of developers who we get along with so well and with whom we share so many common interests. It's great to be able to take the night off after a busy week and spend time as friends.""Lessons and Advice to Aspiring Entrepreneurs  Ryan started out by emphasizing the importance of having a thick skin and being able to rise up after being turned down. He shared, ""Get used to hearing the word no. It will become your new best friend. One of the big differentiators between startups that make it and ones that fold is the level of persistence in the face of rejection. If a potential investor does not fully understand what you are solving or competitors seem to pop up, these types of things cannot stop you from building your company.""At the same time, Rita talked about the importance of finding key advisors and mentors who have been in your shoes before. She said, ""It's extremely important to be open; share you ideas and ask questions. Find people in your industry who have been through this process and they can help you succeed.""All three founders have their feet set in growing Adventure Bucket List and really improving the quality of life of their friends and people around the world. There's definitely a lot of promise for these three young and entrepreneurial individuals and the rest of the Adventure Bucket List team.

The survey, based on a survey of 483 participants, found more than 15 percent of young women at an unnamed private college in upstate New York disclosed a rape or attempted rape during their first year on campus.The sexual assault claim at the University of Washington has triggered the first such investigation in at least three years at any of the 33 fraternities at the school, which has an undergraduate population of roughly 31,000, said James Ehrmann, assistant director of the college's Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life.Ehrmann said Zeta Psi, which declined comment, had imposed the temporary moratorium on social gatherings in the aftermath of the rape allegation and a finding by the college's Interfraternity Council that the fraternity had failed to register the event, which took place May 21 and involved alcohol.Residents of fraternity houses who are 21 are allowed to consume alcohol in their rooms, but it is generally not allowed to serve or use alcohol in shared areas like living rooms where underage members or guests may be gathered, Ehrmann said.The university notified students, staff and faculty on May 22 that Seattle police were investigating a rape after which a female friend had escorted the victim from ""a residence"" and phoned the police. The victim, identified by police as a student, was treated at a local hospital, university officials said.About 47 rapes were reported in 2014 to police in Seattle, which has a population of more than 600,000, said Seattle Police Department Detective Patrick Michaud.

Meanwhile, my Top 12 Global Teacher Bloggers contributed some much-needed tips on one of the hottest topics for this time of the school calendar year, i.e. combating stress in the classroom.   According to the International Labor Organization, an agency of the UN, global unemployment stood at 201 million people in 2014, 1.2 million higher than in 2013, and that number is expected to rise to 212 million by 2019. The current worldwide unemployment rate among 15 to 24 year olds of 13 percent, which is also expected to increase, is almost 3 times higher than the overall unemployment rate. A mismatch of skills is believed to be a major factor. ""How do we best prepare students for the dramatic socio-economic demands of a digital world in a global age?"" In the hope of finding answers to this question, I helped organize the Oppi Festival at Leman High School in New York City. Full of innovation and debate, the festival's timely themes of Gender: It Matters, Global Collaboration, and Living: The Arts, allowed all its world-renowned participants to reflect deeply in a down-to-earth atmosphere on the future of learning. I sincerely hope there will be many more festivals like Oppi in cities all over the world. As to my question about preparing young people for the future, I greatly enjoyed the many perspectives shared, but especially the one from Andy Hargreaves: ""by developing values that reconnect effort with reward; by creating the social capital of citizenship as well as the individual capital of entrepreneurship; and by making play and creativity the entitlement of all children.""   In Shanghai, I had the pleasure of meeting with Xu Jinjie, (Lecturer at Shanghai Normal University) and Zhu Xiaohu (PHD Candidate Assistant Professor - Institute for Basic Education Research, Shanghai Academy of Educational Sciences) to discuss some of the ways China is combining the best of tradition with innovation. Since Shanghai was top of the charts on the PISA 2009 exam, it has been a worldwide destination for educators. Although exams are deeply rooted in their culture, they are opening up to reform and creativity: ""We want to let students have time to explore their own interests and to make their own choices in learning, and so we give them chances to do that."" Zhu Xiaohu comments. Zhu discussed a pilot for a new student achievement assessment, which will be more about producing student portfolios.   On route to the Education Fast Forward 13 Conference in Norway, it was also a great pleasure to connect with writer and teacher Howard Rheingold, a true Internet pioneer, who coined the term ""virtual communities"" in the 1980s. His long history with the web means that he has some amazing context to provide to the problems of the present, a time in which ""anybody can ask any question anywhere and get thousands of answers within seconds."" However, Howard warns, that this information era requires that we do a lot of extra thinking work to process what information is good and bad. It requires the development of a skill he calls: ""crap detection."" ""The lack of control of quality of information puts the burden on the consumer of information.

The only difference between the two was that one was 27, and the other was 2.We could spend all day talking about the media's reaction and the supposed disrespect to the ""sanctity of the post-game"" as one journalist put it. But let's not.Instead, we can talk about how in the face of so many commentators blaming the civil unrest around our country on absentee fathers, one father chose to spend what little time he has away from his job, with his daughter.Instead of asking why Curry brought his daughter to the post game interview, we should be asking why don't more players do the same?According to the National Fatherhood Initiative, a study involving 134 children of adolescent mothers examining father involvement over the first 10 years of life, researchers found that father-child contact was associated with better socio-emotional and academic functioning. The results indicated that children with more involved fathers experienced fewer behavioral problems and scored higher on reading achievement.This is not an attack on the single mothers who wear both hats and sacrifice their life for the betterment of the children. I have lived in that household, and I am a success because of the hard work my mom put in to make sure my sister and I had everything a kid could dream. What we are talking about is every second either parent uses to spend with their child is a step to a better life for that child.Two years ago, as I held my son in my arms for the first time, something clicked. I couldn't care less about anything outside of my family. I would sacrifice it all to make sure my family stayed healthy, happy and intact. I don't care what you think about my professionalism, I don't care what you say about my parenting. My wife and I decided long time ago we are going to do what's best for our child, and while I thank you for your opinion, you're not going to affect the way I raise him.If I was in the position of Curry, away for my family for days sometimes months, any chance I got to hold my son, I would do it. In the shower, at the grocery store, at the DMV, any place, any time when I needed those little arms to wrap around my shoulders and his warm sweet breath to tickle my neck, damn to all of you.I understand people have a job to do. I understand that sometimes a kid can be a nuisance. Your job, however, is to get the story. You have spent your career taking canned cliches and making them somewhat enticing. You can jump over the hurdle of a cute 2-year-old playing hide and seek under the podium.I wish more professional players brought their kids to these pressers. I wish more reporters, instead of complaining about not getting the quotes needed to produce a story, change the narrative and do a story on players making the most of their time with their children. And for the love of everything cute and cuddly, those kids are, how do i say it, adorbs._________________By Wai SallasA version of this post originally appeared in The Good Men ProjectPhoto Credit: Screengrab"

Rick Santorum announces his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race on Wednesday, May 27, 2015 in Cabot, Pa. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fc792600002d0183c599.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democrats invented it. Republicans are adopting it. Win elections, the theory goes, by fiercely adopting the social issues dear to the base of your chosen party, while rejecting its economic orthodoxy.Slowly now. Andrew Cuomo was the Democrats first ""Progr-actionary."" He was hard left on social issues like gay marriage, guns, abortion, etc. On economic issues he was hard right, a B-version of Paul Ryan, cutting the estate tax, income taxes on the wealthy, bank taxes, etc. Left on social issues; right on economic issues.It didn't work for Cuomo. He got pummeled by the Democratic base and leading progressives in the Working Family Party and limped to primary and general election victories over unknown and unfunded opponents. The Democratic primary voter remains committed to economic policies that favor working and poor families and politicians stray to the 1%-ers at their peril.Now Republicans are trying to figure out if a similar triangulation will work in the presidential race. Both Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum are dyed-in-the-wool social reactionaries (or conservatives if you prefer). There is no one to the right of them on gay marriage, abortion etc. But both are loudly abandoning the economic austerity mantra that has been unchallenged dogma in Republican ranks for decades. Republicans are the party of tax cuts for the rich, makers v. takers, entitlement cuts, and less government. It's bad policy, but it's been necessary to curry favor with the corporate/Koch Brothers rich guys who fund Republican campaigns. Not so fast.Huckabee went first. No cuts in entitlements, Social Security, or Medicare: ""I'll never rob seniors of what our government promised them and even forced them to pay for.""Now Santorum adopts the same zeitgeist: First, he called for an increase in the minimum wage, and then slammed the GOP for its tax-cuts-for-the-rich philosophy ""a 35-year-old message on the economy"" as he pithily phrased it.Economic populism in the Republican Party? It's the mirror image of what Cuomo tried with Democrats. Huckabee and Santorum are looking for voters who are hard right on social issues, but kinda lefty on economic policy. As Cuomo found out, it's not easy to pull off. But there are all kinds of reasons why this is going to get a serious look by Republican voters.Social conservatives are not innately opposed to economic fairness and the grotesque income inequality of recent years is hard to ignore. Evangelicals particularly are open to economic policies that favor the poor for scriptural reasons alone. And most Republican voters are not 1%-ers, they're part of the struggling middle-class that can't find a path out of the Great Recession.There are politically practical reasons for what Huckabee and Santorum are doing as well. Neither has been receiving the big corporate money that demands economic austerity, so neither is giving much away. Neither has registered on national polls, and ""me-too"" is not a strategy to surge in Iowa or New Hampshire.Bill Clinton figured it out 25 years ago. It's the economy, stupid. And policies that benefit the rich, the corporations and the bankers are not necessarily good politics. It's been easy for Democrats to watch the parade of smart guys, weirdos, experienced pols and wing-nuts that has been the Republican race so far. It's been easy to think that 2016 will mirror 2012 when a moderate Republican was forced to his economic right by a bitter primary battle and had nowhere to go in the general election. Two Republican candidates have learned that lesson. Whether Republican voters have learned the same is the next question."

Millions of women in developing countries suffer from the obstetric fistula, a hole in the vagina or rectum caused by prolonged labour without treatment which means they leak urine uncontrollably, and also endure the social stigma arising as a result of it. More than about 200,000 Uganda women live with fistula, but there are 1,900 new cases annually -- this is just above the 1,850 women who were treated surgically in 2013, according to a report by the United Nations Population Fund, which funds the majority of repairs through the Campaign to End Fistula.

Florine was born in a village in northern Madagascar. She married very young and became pregnant with her first child when she was 15. Because of her age and lack of access to quality obstetric care, Florine's already difficult labor turned dangerous. When it came time for her to deliver, her hips were too narrow, and the nearest hospital was too far to reach. After a prolonged labor, she lost the child and was left incontinent from vesicovaginal fistula, a childbirth injury that can shatter women's lives. Fistulas present physical and social adversities to the women who suffer from them. Physically, Florine leaked urine all of the time due to the hole between her bladder and birth canal. Along with discomfort and embarrassment, this caused her to smell. At first her husband was willing to stay and care for her, but when it became clear to him that Florine was unable to bring a baby to term, he left her and remarried. In a culture where a woman's value is synonymous with her value as a mother, Florine believed she was worthless. She felt isolated and alone.But Florine is not alone, and her circumstances are not unique. The Campaign to End Fistula estimates that approximately 2,000 women suffer fistula in Madagascar each year, adding to the estimated 50,000 existing cases of women who need obstetric fistula repair. Thousands of women are suffering needlessly; with the right medical care, fistulas are both preventable and reparable. Through a partnership between global charity Mercy Ships and Johnson & Johnson, more women in Madagascar are gaining access to the care and treatment they need. Onboard the Africa Mercy hospital ship, Mercy Ships' volunteer obstetric surgeons have provided free surgeries, counseling and physical therapy for fistula patients in Tamatave, Madagascar since August 2015. When the ship leaves in May 2016, more than 300 more will have had their fistulas repaired.Efforts to treat those suffering from obstetric fistula include partnerships which provide sutures for the repair procedure and programs to train doctors on surgical techniques, which increase the global capacity for clinical treatment. Additional programs to train skilled birth attendants and midwives help ensure women receive the care and support they need during childbirth to prevent the injury from happening in the first place.By training surgeons and midwives, outfitting health facilities, providing societal support, and always responding to the needs of those on the front lines, we can transform the lives of tens of thousands of women. The good news is we know exactly what it takes to prevent and treat obstetric fistula. We have all the tools we need at our disposal, right now. We're not waiting for a new device or drug or some other silver bullet. But our global capacity for providing these effective interventions is woefully inadequate to the scope and scale of the need.In honor of International Day to End Obstetric Fistula, we honor the brave women who struggle with the shame and burden of fistula, and we welcome partners from around the world to join us in helping to ensure their future is instead filled with hope and potential.

But Friday and Saturday at Lincoln Center and at the Lyric Theatre in Times Square offered plenty of feminist food-for-thought. New York City Ballet's Classic IFriday evening's triumphant dispatching of George Balanchine's plotless Raymonda Variations by 13 ballerinas of New York City Ballet and one brave danseur underscored the supremacy of Mr. B's vision of the American ballerina as an athlete-nymph, who tears through woodlands at a breakneck pace, and who has no need for male companionship - though she may entertain it, if he can match her ballon and batterie. Stepping in for an injured Ashley Bouder, soloist Erica Pereira breezed confidently through the lead role, but it was her five handmaidens who really sent sparks flying. Costumed identically, they represent different sides of the archetypal ballerina. Brittany Pollack was the sassy one, thrusting her hips then traveling about a mile in hops on pointe like no big deal. Kristen Segin delivered a hummingbird solo, landing turning assemblés on pointe. The imperial Megan LeCrone powered through a set of relevés on one leg without needing to put her heel down in plié. Meagan Mann pivoted saucily through her mercurial variation. The radiant Savannah Lowery nearly threw herself off-balance, but kept her foot on the gas, cool as a cucumber.The finale saw the entire ensemble speeding down the autobahn, captained by the rocket-powered LeCrone and Lowery. Joaquin De Luz danced cleanly and ebulliently, and showed up right where Pereira needed him to be for her final heart-stopping dive toward the orchestra pit. (She may have been intending to have a word with the conductor, who propelled her through an insanely fast series of pas de chats without giving her enough time to point her feet properly inflight.) The Raymonda tutus and painted backdrop are in urgent need of updating; they look like they were original in 1961. All those flowers are so yesterday. The sprightly, scrumptious Glazunov score, on the other hand, is timeless.  The blonde goddess Teresa Reichlen and mischievous sprite Sterling Hyltin, in conspiracy with the glorious soprano Marjorie Owens, reigned over Peter Martins' Morgen, keeping it afloat in the Dead Sea of dance clichés. The admirable Rebecca Krohn rounded out the female contingent; their earnest, hardworking partners wore a perpetual look of anxiety, mostly ignored by the choreographer and by the women, even when locked in the tightest of clinches.Program notes tell us there is no story, just ""an atmospheric exploration of love."" The exploration went on for an awfully long time, considering that love in the world of Morgen is expressed mainly through two kinds of movement: promenades and pillows. In the former, the woman is whipped around in a circle - sometimes slowly, sometimes fast - while she stands on one leg. In the latter, the woman arches back in the man's arms and the man presses his head to her breast. Martins has the women try these moves with different partners, which is rather modern, but he stopped short of having the women explore same-sex love - which would have been truly modern. Perhaps out of boredom, the daredevil Hyltin takes a flying leap toward some guy, jumps up and twists in the air, landing with her back arched over his shoulder. He just stands there, his arms flung wide - a piece of furniture for her to drape herself over, or a coat-hanger. It's a stunning, reckless move. Ballet to the People has no clue what it meant. Poured into divine cocktail dresses by Carolina Herrera, dripping diamonds down their backs, the women ended each episodic encounter by bourreé-ing off into the wings, their partners staring after them quizzically before they moseyed off in the opposite direction. We could have listened to Owens sing Strauss lieder all night, her voice like rich butter cream frosting. With her blazing bronze mane, she too looked sensational in a black cocktail dress with asymmetric sheer paneling. Like Raymonda Variations, Jerome Robbins' NY Export: Opus Jazz could use a Carolina Herrera updating. The black leggings and brightly colored sweatshirts may have looked provocative on stage in 1958 but we're all wearing those now. The stunning film version of Opus Jazz, released in 2010, had the dancers in their street clothes, roaming the five boroughs. That look totally worked.   There is absolutely nothing else about Opus Jazz that needs tinkering with. The punchy designs by the great social-realist artist Ben Shahn inspire awe, starting with the opening backdrop - an abstract tangle of TV aerials and telephone poles. Robbins' kids saunter on stage, with attitude. They stake out their turf, and take turns showing off. Girls face off against boys; they declare an uneasy truce. Three guys roam an urban rooftop, restively, on the lookout for rival gangs. Firecracker Georgina Pazcoguin explodes on the scene. She takes on the gang leader. They call in reinforcements, but there is no contest. Pazcoguin becomes the new capo. Taylor Stanley and Ashley Laracey steal away from the pack to explore the magnetic fields around each other's bodies. The sexual heat from their brief encounter could have powered the entire theatre in the event of an electrical failure. Robbins deploys balletic steps, along with hints of mambo, sparingly in this distillation of urban teenage angst, set to Robert Prince's striking jazz score. The memories that linger are of eloquent, highly charged gestures, the unspooling of patterns in the glow of Shahn's incandescent artwork, and individual personalities - above all, the fierce and fearless Pazcoguin.Giselle at American Ballet Theatre Across the plaza at the Metropolitan Opera House, Giselle made landfall, on Saturday afternoon, in the person of Isabella Boylston. This 19th century Romantic classic makes a problematic feminist statement. On the one hand, the wronged peasant girl saves a worthless aristocrat's bacon, thereby preserving the patriarchy. Yet, the true heroine is not the titular Giselle (no slight intended to Boylston, who makes a convincing transformation from captivating, headstrong village girl to magnanimous wraith) but Myrtha, the baleful Queen of the Wilis. Devon Teuscher is a revelation in this role. She swans on stage initially in a blur of bourrées that cut through the fog like a knife, stopping on a dime, with a sharp twist of her head, as she senses the approach of prey (mortal men.) Her enormous jumps seem to come out of nowhere, and land as if on a pillow. While her upper back does not appear as pliant as other Myrthas we've known, her proud carriage commands fear and admiration. She is momentarily moved by Giselle's stalwart defense of the indefensible Albrecht (Alexandre Hammoudi); we see a slight tremor pierce her armor - perhaps a recollection of a past infatuation of her own - but it's only a momentary weakness. Many Myrthas fall into the sand trap of camp, but Teuscher masters the complexity of the character, and sustains the image of an avenging angel, the steadfast grassroots organizer of outcast women. Act II opens on the poignant sight of brokenhearted village youth Hilarion (the compelling Roman Zhurbin) fashioning a simple cross out of wood and rope to place at the head of Giselle's grave. That Giselle and her fellow Wilis are buried in this grim forest and not in the village cemetery bear testament to their sexual transgressions. They could not be blamed for having been betrayed (mainly, we presume, by noblemen who, like Count Albrecht, were exercising their droit de seigneur) but they were ostracized for having sexual relations outside of marriage. At the time of its creation, Giselle reflected ""a 19th century anxiety about growing numbers of unmarried, unmoored women whose sexual appetites could not be contained."" The power of the feminist statement depends entirely on the strength of the portrayal of Myrtha, and on the unity of the Wilis. Saturday matinée was a triumph of ensemble work - crisp and authoritative, united in style down to the angle of the head, the cocking of elbows and wrists, and the enigmatic, focused gaze. Luciana Paris and Misty Copeland made indelible impressions in the role of Myrtha's stalwart lieutenants: both nailed their tricky variations, Paris passionate and daring, Copeland mysterious and sorrowful. Jennifer Tipton's lighting and scenic and costume design by Gianni Quaranta and Anna Anni, respectively, created the requisite eeriness without driving us into a deep depression. Kevin McKenzie's sensitive staging for ABT disappoints in only two respects: Hilarion could have been given more dance to buttress his mime, and Ballet to the People missed the Wilis flying on wires at the opening of Act II. Here, they simply run around behind the trees, illuminated by flashes of lightning, which does not have quite the same heart-stopping effect.Tall, dark and handsome, with a smooth, powerful jump, Hammoudi looks the part of the noble Albrecht, but seemed a little remote in Act I. Boylston was all over him, joy lighting up her face whenever he showed up, but he didn't fully surrender to his emotions until she was quite dead. Dancing at the command of Myrtha in Act II, he was tremendous. His traveling brisés and tortured, beaten jumps right before he collapsed in exhaustion were light and magnificent, fueled by the power of Giselle's forgiveness. Giselle herself must have that perpetually windswept quality in Act II (she is a ghost after all), and Boylston thrives in outer space, finding more oxygen the higher she goes. The pure joy she found in jumping when she was human transforms into an instinct to escape the pull of the grave in Act II. Sorrow and resignation are permanently etched in her face even as she admonishes Albrecht to show some spine and keep dancing to stay alive. She never looks at him, she merely senses his presence as he provides the occasional, invisible underpinning to her jumps. But it is her solo allegro work that is the true high point of her dancing, including a set of quicksilver fishtail soubresauts. On the ground, Boylston goes from zero to ninety in her piqué turns and, in her first appearance as a Wili, she whips up a veritable tornado of spinning hops in attitude. The wildness of that introduction makes a vital connection to the mad scene that brought down the curtain on Act I. The way the Giselle narrative is framed, choreographically, implies that women who flouted social conventions when it came to sex must be on the verge of insanity.On the Town Which brings us to On the Town, that delicious confection inspired by Jerome Robbins' groundbreaking ballet Fancy Free, about three sailors on shore leave. The crowds that jammed the Lyric Theatre on Saturday evening of Memorial Day weekend included a sizeable contingent of sailors, male and female, in town for Fleet Week - so patriotic fervor was running high. In place of an overture, the spiffing orchestra played ""The Star Spangled Banner,"" and cast members frequently hopped off stage to exchange banter with the real deal in the audience. Just four blocks away, at the Palace Theatre, An American in Paris is providing stiff competition for On the Town and, while no show can touch the colossal Gershwin songbook that provides the bones for American in Paris (not even Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden and Adolph Green at their wittiest), On the Town boasts a superior orchestra and sound. Unfortunately, every sneeze in the script erupts into a fullblown musical number, yet, apart from the iconic ""New York, New York,"" no other song lingers in memory after the last chord is played. Joshua Bergasse's choreography is another matter, exuberant, swellegant, and endlessly inventive, buoyed by the kinetic scenic and projection designs by Beowulf Boritt. Jerome Robbins, known to be one of the most difficult, capricious and obsessive geniuses of the 20th century, would likely have saluted Bergasse.Our valiant sailors (the make-believe ones) sang and danced up a storm, and pined over dames. They are, however, stock characters, and, weighed down by so many unmemorable songs, their distinctive personalities are not as sharply etched as they were in Fancy Free. The true heroes of the musical turn out to be the two leading ladies: cab driver Hildy and paleoanthropologist Claire, played to perfection by Alysha Umphress and Elizabeth Stanley. In a play that is in so many ways a throwback to the 1940's, the frank, freewheeling sexuality of these two female characters is refreshing. Hildy picks up the shy sailor Chip (Jay Armstrong Johnson) in her taxi and immediately orders him to ""Kiss me,"" before taking him on the wildest cab ride of his life. ""I'm young, I'm free, I'm highly attainable,"" she sums up her selling points, then insists ""Come up to my place.""  The lady scientist Claire is only slightly more in control of her erotic impulses when she spots the sailor Ozzie (Clyde Alves) at the Natural History Museum. She insists on taking his cranial and other measurements, and in no time the pair are wreaking havoc with the Tyrannosaurus Rex display.Stanley's big operatic voice pairs nicely with Umphress' bold, brassy belt; both have terrific comic timing and can hoof it with the best.  The central dance role is filled by New York City Ballet's adorable Megan Fairchild in the role of Ivy Smith, ""Miss Turnstiles for the month of June."" (Serendipitously, her brother, Robert Fairchild, also a principal dancer with City Ballet, plays the lead in American in Paris.) Fairchild dazzles in all her scenes, including an erotic dream pas de deux with sailor Gabey (Tony Yazbeck), set in a boxing ring. Ivy Smith, however, is just another stock character - an ingénue-with-a-secret. There's another one of them in American in Paris, Lise Dassin, danced with great style by Royal Ballet ballerina Leanne Cope. Cope's secret is that she is a Jew, and was sheltered from the Nazis by a wealthy and compassionate Parisian family.Ivy Smith's secret is that she's really a ""cooch dancer"" at a seedy club, and if the subway-riding public find out that she isn't exactly the girl-next-door, she'll be stripped of her crown. (Since the Miss Turnstiles crown is handed to a different girl every month, this hardly seems like a big risk.) The magnetic Fairchild exudes more wattage than Cope, and we end up falling, like Gabey, in love with Ivy Smith, while we simply admire Lise Dassin from afar. Yet neither of these characters rock our world like the free-thinking, free-loving Hildy and Claire. For all its manic silliness, On the Town, like Fancy Free, is rooted in a profound sense of loss, insecurity and impermanence. Our trio of sailors must return to their ship after 24 hours of comic mishaps and breathless lovemaking - leaving Hildy, Claire and Ivy waving mournfully from the dock. After all, the shadow of World War II looms. The most poignant lyric from the show reminds us that:This day was just a token Too many words are still unspoken Oh well, we'll catch up Some other timeBack in December, 1944, when On the Town premièred, the War was in its final stages and the Axis was crumbling. Fancy Free and On the Town must have struck a particularly poignant chord with audiences. On the Town also made theatre history with its casting of Japanese American ballerina Sono Osato in the role of the all-American Miss Turnstiles. The cognitive dissonance of placing an Asian woman onstage in a beauty queen role that would have been denied her in real life was compounded by the distressing fact that, three years prior, her Japanese father had been arrested and interned along with over 100,000 Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor. The dance chorus of On the Town was also mixed-race, further challenging accepted casting practices on Broadway at the time.Today, American sailors are involved in conflicts around the globe, and an increasing number of them are women. There are fewer racial barriers on Broadway than there were in 1944 - though an all-Asian production of Showboat was recently cancelled after a public outcry of racism.In a constantly shifting political climate, the entertainment industry increasingly plays it safe for commercial reasons, and it is only the small, experimental productions who tend to challenge mainstream attitudes toward gender, sexuality and race. It is therefore vital to celebrate the Myrthas, the Hildys and Claires. And to continue to shower breakthrough roles on intrepid dancers like Georgina Pazcoguin, Teresa Reichlen, Sterling Hyltin, Isabella Boylston, Devon Teuscher, Savannah Lowery, and Megan LeCrone who, wordlessly, perform Hildy's immortal lyric: I'm not in the recipe book...  Baby, I'm cookin' with gas"

On the Town also made theatre history with its casting of Japanese American ballerina Sono Osato in the role of the all-American Miss Turnstiles. The cognitive dissonance of placing an Asian woman onstage in a beauty queen role that would have been denied her in real life was compounded by the distressing fact that, three years prior, her Japanese father had been arrested and interned along with over 100,000 Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor. The dance chorus of On the Town was also mixed-race, further challenging accepted casting practices on Broadway at the time.Today, American sailors are involved in conflicts around the globe, and an increasing number of them are women. There are fewer racial barriers on Broadway than there were in 1944 - though an all-Asian production of Showboat was recently cancelled after a public outcry of racism.In a constantly shifting political climate, the entertainment industry increasingly plays it safe for commercial reasons, and it is only the small, experimental productions who tend to challenge mainstream attitudes toward gender, sexuality and race. It is therefore vital to celebrate the Myrthas, the Hildys and Claires. And to continue to shower breakthrough roles on intrepid dancers like Georgina Pazcoguin, Teresa Reichlen, Sterling Hyltin, Isabella Boylston, Devon Teuscher, Savannah Lowery, and Megan LeCrone who, wordlessly, perform Hildy's immortal lyric: I'm not in the recipe book...  Baby, I'm cookin' with gas"

Former FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam has won his case against a life ban from football for allegedly bribing voters during his challenge to Sepp Blatter. However, the Court of Arbitration for Sport says its panel upheld bin Hammam's appeal because of lack of evidence _ and was not convinced he is innocent of corruption. Still, the CAS ruling overturns FIFA verdicts which had exiled the 63-year-old Qatari. (AP Photo/Shirley Bahadur, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77dfd2600002d0183516c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Qatar's 2022 World Cup is promising to be a rare example of a mega sporting event that leaves a legacy of social, political and economic change -- but not in the way the Gulf state's ruling family had imagined.Controversy about Qatar's successful bid coupled with world soccer body FIFA's failure to seriously tackle corruption in soccer governance in its own house as well as its regional federations, prominent among which the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), led to this week's unveiling of indictments against 14 senior current and past soccer FIFA executives and sports businessmen.The scandal goes to the heart of not only financial corruption but also the enabling environment of political corruption rooted in the political sway of political forces often aligned with autocratic governments like those of the Middle East within FIFA, the AFC and the Olympic Council of Asia.The scandal is compounded by mounting criticism of Qatar's controversial labor regime and the Gulf state's failure to so far make good on lofty reform promises. That has not only prompted global corporations who sponsor FIFA to speak out but also sparked discussion on the ethical responsibility of corporate sponsors embarrassed by what crusading journalist Andrew Jennings termed a criminal organization.Given resistance to change within FIFA as well as several regional soccer bodies like the AFC, only three stakeholders had the potential of shaking soccer governance's tree: the judiciary, fans and corporate sponsors. Prosecutors in the US and Switzerland took the lead this week.The US Department of Justice had a legal base with the presence on US soil of the Miami-based Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) -- virtually all those indicted hail from the Americas -- the involvement of a prominent US national, the fact that potentially illicit US dollar payments were processed through US banks, and the legislative and judicial infrastructure capable of taking on a global investigation.By contrast, fans with the exception of a few demonstrations and statements primarily in Britain and Scotland were largely apathetic to what was a far-from-my-bed show in the stratosphere of soccer while corporate sponsors also took a lead in recent weeks with sharp statements criticizing controversial labor conditions in Qatar.The corporates were joined this week by former and present international players who in a letter demanded that Qatar abolish its controversial kafala system or sponsorship system that puts workers at the mercy of their employers. The letter asserted that those working on the 2022 World Cup were being ""held hostage on the world's biggest building site""The combination of legal action in the United States and Switzerland coupled with corporate unrest should give Qatar reason for concern. The threat to Qatar's retaining its hosting rights is multi-fold and has increased substantially with the legal proceedings. The legal proceedings also threaten with the focus on sports rights companies to shine a spotlight on companies' cozy commercial relationships with soccer governance bodies that various regional federations, first and foremost among which the AFC, have sought to maintain at whatever cost.While the US investigation appears to be initial focused on events in the Americas and the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, it is also looking at the 2011 FIFA presidential election that sparked the downfall of Mr. Bin Hammam. ‎That election is closely tied to the Qatari bid and together with the FIFA vote in favor of Russia, the focus of the Swiss criminal proceedings.Former FIFA executive committee Chuck Blazer, who has already pleaded guilty and is cooperating with US authorities, played an important role in bringing down Mr. Bin Hammam. Mr. Blazer allegedly sat next to Mr. Bin Hammam during the December 2, 2010 FIFA executive committee meeting that voted in favor of Qatar and watched‎ the Qatari tick off a list of names of those voting for the Gulf state. The assertion was that Mr. Bin Hammam's list included the names of those whom he had bought.Similarly‎, the sons of disgraced soccer executive, Jack Warner, Darry and Daryan Warner a former FIFA executive committee member and Bin Hammam associate, have followed Mr. Blazer in working with US authorities. Jack Warner, one of the 14 indicted executives, turned himself in to police in Trinidad and Tobago on Wednesday night local time.Mr. Warner was instrumental in Mr. Bin Hammam's campaigns for both the Qatar World Cup and the FIFA presidency. Mr. Warner resigned from FIFA in 2011 to avoid legal proceedings by the soccer body. Mr. Warner warned at the time that he would bring the house down on FIFA after he released an email from FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke asserting that the Qatar World Cup had been bought.While the US and Swiss proceedings ‎focus on financial corruption, they are unlikely to tackle the equally serious problem of political corruption resulting from the close association of soccer and political corruption that often served as an enabler for illicit financial dealings and are at the heart of FIFA's Qatar and Russia-related scandals, the Bin Hammam affair and the AFC scandals the group is seeking to suppress.This blog together with the Malay Mail sparked the suspension earlier this month of AFC general secretary Dato Alex Soosay pending investigation into allegations that he attempted to have documents hidden or destroyed related to multiple potentially illegal payments as well as the group's corporate dealings.AFC president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, a member of the Bahraini ruling family that in 2011‎ brutally crushed a popular revolt during which some 150 athletes and sports executives were arrested. They included on Sheikh Salman's watch as head of the Bahrain Football Association national soccer team players who were reportedly tortured. Sheikh Salman failed to stand up for his players or address the allegations against him.Sheikh Salman has further gone out of his way to bury an independent audit that disclosed massive financial shenanigans within the AFC and raised serious questions about the group's $1 billion master rights agreement with Singapore-based World Sports Group. (WSG). WSG's legal effort to force this author to disclose sources failed in 2014 with a damning Singapore Supreme Court ruling against it.The US and Swiss legal proceedings put the Qatari World Cup bid in the spotlight.‎ Recent revelations by The Sunday Times leave little doubt about corruption in the Qatari bid. But to be fair, Qatar and Russia played the game the way it is played in FIFA. England lost its 2018 World Cup bid for the simple reason that it insisted on walking a straight and ethically and legally correct line.As a result, depriving Qatar of its hosting rights without also tackling Russia and more importantly radically reforming FIFA and soccer governance worldwide to root out a culture of financial and political corruption would turn the Gulf state into a scapegoat. Moreover, the question is, what is the most favorable result of the legal proceedings: uprooting a deep-rooted culture, enabling sporting mega events to be vehicles of change or punitive retribution?‎While Qatar scrambles to counter potential fallout from the legal proceedings, it is certain to feel pressure to act swiftly to address concerns about the working and living conditions of workers, including those involved in World Cup-related construction projects. Migrant workers constitute the majority of Qatar's population.To Qatar's credit, it stands out since winning its World Cup hosting rights as the only Gulf state to engage with its critics in a part of the world that incarcerates or bars entry to those who don't tow the autocrats' line. Qatar has in recent weeks been under fire for failing to make good on lofty promises and cracking down on its critics as well as foreign media reporting on labour and World Cup-related issues.Qatar's engagement was a first step in the kind of change the 2022 World Cup can spark. So is the fact that corporate sponsors are rethinking what it means to grant financial support.""What are brands Adidas, Gazprom, Hyundai, Kia, McDonald's, Budweiser, Coca-Cola and Visa to do over allegations of improper conduct in working conditions at the 2022 World Cup building sites in Qatar?... A brand's moral compass is being tested here and whilst many brands had commented last year, most notably Adidas who's association with FIFA extends to 2030, issued statements alongside Sony... As consumers we can influence and help brands recognise and understand that as global citizens our expectation is that we'd at least like them to demonstrate that they care and lead by example,"" said David Todaro, writing in Branding Magazine.James M. Dorsey is a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies as Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, co-director of the Institute of Fan Culture of the University of Würzburg and the author of the blog, The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer, and a forthcoming book with the same title."

I'm sure, based on our interview, if I were on the phone with her, telling her I was starting the post this way, she would say: ""Thank you, that's so nice, I appreciate it, but you really don't have to say that. It's too much."" But it's true so I'm going to say it.   I've seen many The King and I productions throughout the years, but I've never seen a Lady Thiang quite like Miles's Lady Thiang. She has a real strength about her, but also a real sensitivity and warmth. She clearly loves her King. She is not someone who is just there, she realizes everything going on around her. Her ""Something Wonderful"" is amazing vocally--I'm sure those who saw her in Here Lies Love are not surprised by that--but what I think is so brilliant about her performance is her ability to pay attention to her surroundings. We've all been there in the theater for this: a supporting character is onstage, but not the focus of the attention, and that actor is obviously in his/her own world. You can tell when you look at the performer, that person assumes you are not looking at her/him, and that person is just waiting for a cue, not focusing on the character. Miles is present in every moment. Her Lady Thiang quietly watches everything that goes on around her. If you sit close enough, you'll see her eyes widen and constrict during certain relevant parts. And I'm not talking about at the first performance or at the second performance, I'm talking about last week, when she was likely already a little fatigued thanks to the award show season. She is still watching the other performers, in character. Her moments of talking and singing are great, but the story for her character is also told in her moments of silence. Because of the intelligence of the performance throughout, Lady Thiang is more empathetic than in other productions I have seen. People leave the theater talking about her, in addition to Kelli O'Hara of course. They leave the theater talking about a character that often is a bland afterthought in mountings of The King and I. Yes, she has one amazing song (and leads another quirky one), but you usually don't think of her beyond that. People who see this King and I will think about Lady Thiang. They will think about what she knows, what she feels, what is motivating her. That is the genius of Ruthie Ann Miles's performance. I was so happy when she received her Tony nomination and when she won the Outer Critics Circle Award. I realize she's not the favorite for the big award, but, while all the nominees in that category are giving notable performances, she's my choice. So I asked her to take time out of her busy schedule -- in addition to being a Tony nominee, with all the activities that entails, she is the mother of an almost two-and-a-half year old daughter who she says is giving her and her husband ""a run for [their] money"" -- to speak with me about her Tony Awards experience thus far.How did you find out you were nominated?My agent called me right away. I had pretty bad insomnia the night before. Maybe because I knew the nominations were the next day. Maybe. I try not to pay attention to those things. My daughter was sick the night before. She woke up in the middle of the night. And I'm one of those people who has trouble falling back asleep. She woke up 6am, she usually sleeps until 8am. She finally went back to sleep at 7am. I fell back asleep as well, and then my agent [Dustin Flores from THE MINE talent agency] called me. He said: ""Ruthie? How are you doing? What are you doing?"" I said: ""I just woke up. What is wrong?"" Then my phone starting buzzing and ringing. I thought something horrible had happened, like 9/11. He said nothing was wrong, I had just been nominated for a Tony. As he's telling me I got nominated for a Tony, I hear Abigail say from the next room: ""Mommy, wake up now. I poo-pooed."" So almost immediately it's back to normal life. My daughter is saying she needs my attention more than the phone call. I hung up and took care of business.   Who was the first person you wanted to call and tell?  I have a few girlfriends that are just the dearest to me. I Facetimed with one, and then while I was doing that, one had texted and the other left a voicemail. They know me so, so well. They didn't say ""congratulations."" They said things like: ""Breath. Calm down. If you need me, I'm here for you."" They know me so very well. They were just reminding me that everything comes and goes. It's going to be crazy now. They said: ""Don't go on Facebook."" I still haven't really. When I go on, I skip over certain days. It's just so overwhelming. So many people have been so kind. People I haven't spoken to in decades remembering a performance I did or a song I sang in PE to motivate us. It's been so nice, but I need to read those slowly in private.Where was your husband?He had already left for work.He left me a voicemail. He's a civilian. The message said: ""I read about your nomination. This is a big deal, right? I love you."" It was three sentences. It put the biggest smile on my face.If I start to buy into the hype, it's going to be too much. My mother came in, and she treated it like just another thing. She congratulated me, but she treated it like a good review. She was happy for me like after a good review.This is your Broadway debut and therefore you're a naturally a first-time nominee. There is a ton of stuff that goes along with being nominated; I think people don't often realize. Were you expecting the amount of activities involved in a nomination? No. In the biggest loudest, longest way I could ever say it: NO! I had no clue.We're also going to be performing. So we've had multiple rehearsals for a scene we do every night. Last Thursday, 30 to 40 people from the Tony Awards crew, video staff and their assistants came to see the performance. We are going to have 30 minutes after the show to get out of hair and makeup and get to the Tonys in buses. I have never been before. I have been watching it for years. I've never been. It was a dream of mine to attend the ceremony once. Just to attend. But I never dreamed it would be like this. It's amazing to know now what it takes to put on something so huge. Millions of people watch it -- of course it takes this much, I just didn't realize. They do a scratch tape, so they were taping us. We have to be there at 9am for rehearsal on the day of the show. I had no clue. It's so seemless when you watch it on television. I maybe pictured one camera director and four cameras. So I pictured someone saying: ""Camera A, Camera D, Camera A, Camera C."" That is what I thought. It's not that. It is a massive team of people who are never going to get applause. It's huge.  And there are so many events before...I think a smarter me would have asked how many events I'd be going to and do a tally of how many dresses I was going to need and then ask someone to dress me. I've worn everything I have, things I wore for Here Lies Love events, things I wore before that. It's been wonderful, I'm not complaining. I had no clue how many people would want to celebrate with me.I won the Lucille Lortel Award and the Theatre World Award for Here Lies Love. The Lortels do only off-Broadway, but the Theatre World Awards do both on Broadway and off-Broadway and they noticed me, and Conrad [Ricamora], who was also in the show. I remember it so well. Tom Hanks was there. Me and Tom Hanks. This year, they both asked me to present. I was very, very, very honored. Those had such an impact on me.It's been many events, but it's been wonderful. I would go to them all -- if so many of them didn't conflict. What are you doing for your dress?Ms. [Anna] Wintour is nicely handling all of that; I'm consulting with one of her stylists.Wow. When did you find out?A couple of weekends ago. Last week one of the stylists came to theater to talk to me about what I like, what colors. I said: ""I tell stories for a living, you are a professional. I will do whatever you want me to do.""  When do you find out what you're going to wear?  I'm going next week to try on some things.  And it's perfect because you are out of your own dresses.Yes. It's a lot less stress not having any say! It is wonderful. I am assuming your husband is going to be your date to the ceremony?Yes, and my agent is going to be sitting with me, which is great. I've been with my agency for many years -- he means a lot to me. So I was really honored that he is spending the high ticket price to be by my side. It's really a very high ticket price. Other than in your category -- who are you rooting for most?  I cannot imagine Kelli not winning. I watch her every night and I learn something about Ruthie and Lady Thiang. I learn so much from her every night. Lady Thiang doesn't talk that much, but sometimes I wonder: ""Lady Thiang, why do you talk so much? You should just want Kelli playing Anna."" Her performance is subtle and powerful at the same time. It's not a flashy performance, it's very subtle. But if you watch her, she will change your life. Anna Leonowens went in there to teach these children to give them a better future, Kelli is a teacher, watching Kelli makes me better. I can't entertain the idea that she won't win.All photos are from The King and I and by Paul Kolnik. In addition to Ruthie Ann Miles, the bottom photo features Ashley Park, who plays Tuptim in the revival."

I'm sure, based on our interview, if I were on the phone with her, telling her I was starting the post this way, she would say: ""Thank you, that's so nice, I appreciate it, but you really don't have to say that. It's too much."" But it's true so I'm going to say it.   I've seen many The King and I productions throughout the years, but I've never seen a Lady Thiang quite like Miles's Lady Thiang. She has a real strength about her, but also a real sensitivity and warmth. She clearly loves her King. She is not someone who is just there, she realizes everything going on around her. Her ""Something Wonderful"" is amazing vocally--I'm sure those who saw her in Here Lies Love are not surprised by that--but what I think is so brilliant about her performance is her ability to pay attention to her surroundings. We've all been there in the theater for this: a supporting character is onstage, but not the focus of the attention, and that actor is obviously in his/her own world. You can tell when you look at the performer, that person assumes you are not looking at her/him, and that person is just waiting for a cue, not focusing on the character. Miles is present in every moment. Her Lady Thiang quietly watches everything that goes on around her. If you sit close enough, you'll see her eyes widen and constrict during certain relevant parts. And I'm not talking about at the first performance or at the second performance, I'm talking about last week, when she was likely already a little fatigued thanks to the award show season. She is still watching the other performers, in character. Her moments of talking and singing are great, but the story for her character is also told in her moments of silence. Because of the intelligence of the performance throughout, Lady Thiang is more empathetic than in other productions I have seen. People leave the theater talking about her, in addition to Kelli O'Hara of course. They leave the theater talking about a character that often is a bland afterthought in mountings of The King and I. Yes, she has one amazing song (and leads another quirky one), but you usually don't think of her beyond that. People who see this King and I will think about Lady Thiang. They will think about what she knows, what she feels, what is motivating her. That is the genius of Ruthie Ann Miles's performance. I was so happy when she received her Tony nomination and when she won the Outer Critics Circle Award. I realize she's not the favorite for the big award, but, while all the nominees in that category are giving notable performances, she's my choice. So I asked her to take time out of her busy schedule -- in addition to being a Tony nominee, with all the activities that entails, she is the mother of an almost two-and-a-half year old daughter who she says is giving her and her husband ""a run for [their] money"" -- to speak with me about her Tony Awards experience thus far.How did you find out you were nominated?My agent called me right away. I had pretty bad insomnia the night before. Maybe because I knew the nominations were the next day. Maybe. I try not to pay attention to those things. My daughter was sick the night before. She woke up in the middle of the night. And I'm one of those people who has trouble falling back asleep. She woke up 6am, she usually sleeps until 8am. She finally went back to sleep at 7am. I fell back asleep as well, and then my agent [Dustin Flores from THE MINE talent agency] called me. He said: ""Ruthie? How are you doing? What are you doing?"" I said: ""I just woke up. What is wrong?"" Then my phone starting buzzing and ringing. I thought something horrible had happened, like 9/11. He said nothing was wrong, I had just been nominated for a Tony. As he's telling me I got nominated for a Tony, I hear Abigail say from the next room: ""Mommy, wake up now. I poo-pooed."" So almost immediately it's back to normal life. My daughter is saying she needs my attention more than the phone call. I hung up and took care of business.   Who was the first person you wanted to call and tell?  I have a few girlfriends that are just the dearest to me. I Facetimed with one, and then while I was doing that, one had texted and the other left a voicemail. They know me so, so well. They didn't say ""congratulations."" They said things like: ""Breath. Calm down. If you need me, I'm here for you."" They know me so very well. They were just reminding me that everything comes and goes. It's going to be crazy now. They said: ""Don't go on Facebook."" I still haven't really. When I go on, I skip over certain days. It's just so overwhelming. So many people have been so kind. People I haven't spoken to in decades remembering a performance I did or a song I sang in PE to motivate us. It's been so nice, but I need to read those slowly in private.Where was your husband?He had already left for work.He left me a voicemail. He's a civilian. The message said: ""I read about your nomination. This is a big deal, right? I love you."" It was three sentences. It put the biggest smile on my face.If I start to buy into the hype, it's going to be too much. My mother came in, and she treated it like just another thing. She congratulated me, but she treated it like a good review. She was happy for me like after a good review.This is your Broadway debut and therefore you're a naturally a first-time nominee. There is a ton of stuff that goes along with being nominated; I think people don't often realize. Were you expecting the amount of activities involved in a nomination? No. In the biggest loudest, longest way I could ever say it: NO! I had no clue.We're also going to be performing. So we've had multiple rehearsals for a scene we do every night. Last Thursday, 30 to 40 people from the Tony Awards crew, video staff and their assistants came to see the performance. We are going to have 30 minutes after the show to get out of hair and makeup and get to the Tonys in buses. I have never been before. I have been watching it for years. I've never been. It was a dream of mine to attend the ceremony once. Just to attend. But I never dreamed it would be like this. It's amazing to know now what it takes to put on something so huge. Millions of people watch it -- of course it takes this much, I just didn't realize. They do a scratch tape, so they were taping us. We have to be there at 9am for rehearsal on the day of the show. I had no clue. It's so seemless when you watch it on television. I maybe pictured one camera director and four cameras. So I pictured someone saying: ""Camera A, Camera D, Camera A, Camera C."" That is what I thought. It's not that. It is a massive team of people who are never going to get applause. It's huge.  And there are so many events before...I think a smarter me would have asked how many events I'd be going to and do a tally of how many dresses I was going to need and then ask someone to dress me. I've worn everything I have, things I wore for Here Lies Love events, things I wore before that. It's been wonderful, I'm not complaining. I had no clue how many people would want to celebrate with me.I won the Lucille Lortel Award and the Theatre World Award for Here Lies Love. The Lortels do only off-Broadway, but the Theatre World Awards do both on Broadway and off-Broadway and they noticed me, and Conrad [Ricamora], who was also in the show. I remember it so well. Tom Hanks was there. Me and Tom Hanks. This year, they both asked me to present. I was very, very, very honored. Those had such an impact on me.It's been many events, but it's been wonderful. I would go to them all -- if so many of them didn't conflict. What are you doing for your dress?Ms. [Anna] Wintour is nicely handling all of that; I'm consulting with one of her stylists.Wow. When did you find out?A couple of weekends ago. Last week one of the stylists came to theater to talk to me about what I like, what colors. I said: ""I tell stories for a living, you are a professional. I will do whatever you want me to do.""  When do you find out what you're going to wear?  I'm going next week to try on some things.  And it's perfect because you are out of your own dresses.Yes. It's a lot less stress not having any say! It is wonderful. I am assuming your husband is going to be your date to the ceremony?Yes, and my agent is going to be sitting with me, which is great. I've been with my agency for many years -- he means a lot to me. So I was really honored that he is spending the high ticket price to be by my side. It's really a very high ticket price. Other than in your category -- who are you rooting for most?  I cannot imagine Kelli not winning. I watch her every night and I learn something about Ruthie and Lady Thiang. I learn so much from her every night. Lady Thiang doesn't talk that much, but sometimes I wonder: ""Lady Thiang, why do you talk so much? You should just want Kelli playing Anna."" Her performance is subtle and powerful at the same time. It's not a flashy performance, it's very subtle. But if you watch her, she will change your life. Anna Leonowens went in there to teach these children to give them a better future, Kelli is a teacher, watching Kelli makes me better. I can't entertain the idea that she won't win.All photos are from The King and I and by Paul Kolnik.

In the 7th Century BC, Draco made it the only punishment for any crime. According to Plutarch, ""Draco...being asked why he made death the penalty for most offences, replied that in his opinion the lesser ones deserved it, and for the greater ones no heavier penalty could be found.""In the twenty first century, the death penalty is a roiling pot of controversy. No more is stoning, scaphism, or even crushing by elephant a part of our lexicon. Instead, the green mile to the altar of death is lined with red tape. As we struggle to delineate the upper limits of the United States justice system, ideas of human rights and financial concerns render the situation much more complex than ancient forms of punishment and torture. The trial and conviction of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev brings this conflict to the forefront.  A courtroom sketch of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sentenced to death in Boston. Credit Jane Flavell CollinsKaren Brassard, one of Tsarnaev's victims in the Boston Marathon Bombings, acknowledged the fact that ""all-but-certain appeals meant the case could drag out over years if not decades."" In CAREY DEAN MOORE v. NEBRASKA, Justice Breyer's dissenting opinion included the idea that ""Our Constitution was written at a time when delay between sentencing and execution could be measured in days or weeks, not decades."" English law in the 18th century called for executions to take place on ""the next day but one"" after sentencing. It is not unusual for many inmates on death row to die of natural causes, and even old age. As the gap between conviction and execution widens, we can expect to see even more of this. These facts speak to one of the most blatant failings of our prison system. According to the US Department of Justice, in 2010, the average time between sentencing and execution was nearly 15 years for inmates on death row. The speed of a death sentence conviction is simply a wolf in sheep's clothing: the illusion of Tsarnaev's imminent death is just that. And beyond that, this dog and pony show has real, tangible ramifications for the taxpaying American public. In Washington, a study found that death penalty cases averaged $1 million more than similar cases where the death penalty was not sought. Defense costs were three times as high, and prosecution costs were four times higher. A study in California concluded that a repeal of the death penalty could save the state as much as $5 billion over the next 20 years. We the People are literally paying for the illusion of a harsher sentence. Nonwithstanding the financial concerns of the penalty, Tsarnaev's death sentence represents an illusion for both the victims of the bombings and the public. While the sentence carries with it a tantalizing news byte for journalists, as of now, that's all it is. Rendered unequivocally guilty by the jury, Tsarnaev will now wind his way through the court system, draining American resources for years to come."

The decision follows years of activism by students pushing for a name change. Along with the renaming, the trustees said in a news release that they plan to put a 16-year freeze on naming other buildings and to develop new education initiatives. These may include an updated website and an improved campus tour that includes a comprehensive history of the school alongside the broader history of slavery and civil rights.""These efforts to curate the campus and teach the past with greater context will present future generations with a more accurate, complete and accessible understanding of Carolina’s history,"" said Dr. Lowry Caudill, chairman of the board of trustees.A plaque will be placed in Carolina Hall that reads, ""We honor and remember all those who have suffered injustices at the hands of those who would deny them life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" William Saunders was an alum of the UNC class of 1854 and served as North Carolina's Secretary of State from 1879 to 1891. He ""became known as the chief organizer of the Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina and Chapel Hill"" around 1869, according to the university. When the building was named for Saunders in 1920, the trustees cited his leadership in the KKK as one of his credentials. In their announcement Thursday, the current trustees said their predecessors were wrong to have used that as a qualification for naming.A university spokesperson told The Huffington Post that the naming freeze is being put in place so the new education initiatives can be more fully processed through four cycles of students who can recognize the school's history -- including its darker parts.This freeze means that buildings like the Aycock Residence, which some students have called to be renamed, will not be changed for at least 16 years. The building is named for Charles Aycock, who was involved in the white supremacy movement around the turn of the 20th century. At Duke University and East Carolina University, buildings named after Aycock have been renamed in the last year."

But this lion, this silverback gorilla, is wounded and losing blood fast: its sales and profits have plummeted as consumers flock toward other restaurant chains that are perceived as more exciting (Taco Bell), healthier (Panera) or both (Chipotle). But McDonald's isn't going down without a fight. The company installed a new CEO, Steve Easterbrook, earlier this year, and he's gone to great lengths to assure investors that he's willing to do whatever is necessary to turn the chain around. His first announcements weren't very promising; they were long on jargon about corporate structure and short on concrete changes to the actual restaurants themselves. This week, though, speaking at the Bernstein's Strategic Decisions Conference in New York, Easterbrook announced his ideas for tweaking the McDonald's menu. Most notably, Easterbrook said that McDonald's will soon begin toasting its hamburger buns for longer than it currently does (which, judging by the taste and texture of those buns, can't be very long at all.) He also said that McDonald's cooks will soon start searing and grilling burger patties in a slightly different way. Both changes, apparently, are intended to lead to ""hotter, tastier food."" McDonald's is one of several chain restaurants that in recent years have pinned turnaround hopes on sandwich bread -- which industry insiders call ""carriers"" for the meat within . Chili's announced just a few weeks ago that it is debuting new hamburger buns treated with an egg wash to make them more Instagram-ready, and Wendy's has spent years experimenting with types of carriers from pretzel buns to ""artisan flatbreads"" in an effort to drum up consumer excitement.The industry's enthusiasm for these ingredients probably stems from the success Taco Bell has found with its Doritos Locos Taco; the product is exactly the same as regular Taco Bell tacos if you don't count the tortilla. But a slightly warmed bun is a far less radical shift than a Doritos-flavored taco shell -- and it remains to be seen whether it will be radical enough for McDonald's to reverse its disastrous sales trends.

On a recent trip to Orlando, Florida, I visited both, but some family travel experts make a case for experiencing just one. See: Best Things to Do in OrlandoWhy you should pick only one Plenty of families head into their Orlando vacation planning to split time between Disney World and Universal Orlando, but that's not necessarily a one-size-fits-all strategy. ""Whether that makes sense for a particular family depends an awful lot on kids' ages, interests and the time of year,"" said Suzanne Rowan Kelleher, family vacations expert at About.com.""There's a lot to be said for 'less is more' when it comes to theme park vacations,"" Kelleher said. ""I would recommend picking either Disney or Universal, and leaving enough downtime to spend an afternoon or a day relaxing at the hotel pool.""If you have younger kids, trying to jam two sets of theme parks into one trip may only lead to fatigue-induced tantrums. Younger kids tend to favor the Disney parks, thanks to their plethora of princes and princesses, kid-friendly rides and costumed characters, while teens are more likely to be attracted to the bigger thrills offered at Universal Orlando and Islands of Adventure.Mindi McMillan, who traveled to Orlando with her husband, parents and four teens last October, said that Universal was the perfect trip for teenagers, especially for her family of Harry Potter fans. The group only went to Universal parks, spending three days there -- one day at each park, and the third day riding all of their favorites rides at both parks again.""It's hard to get an 18-year-old to smile at a theme park with his parents, but our kids were having so much fun,"" she said. McMillan also found that three solid days allowed them to focus on every little detail put into each ride and themed area, especially Diagon Alley at Universal Orlando.Aside from your family's interests, the time of year and the length of your vacation should also play into your decision. You may have better luck seeing everything you want in a shorter time during fall or winter (when it's not peak season at the parks) and if you have seven days for vacation versus three.And while it's no surprise that there's plenty to keep families busy at Disney World's four theme parks, multiple resorts and water parks for a week or more, many travelers may be surprised to find it's possible to spend a five-day vacation solely focusing on Universal.""I think that's one of our under-told stories, really,"" said Jimmy Clarity, public relations coordinator at Universal Orlando Resort. ""This place has grown so much over the last several years that it is now a destination unto itself. You can literally take a 'Universal Orlando vacation' now instead of just an 'Orlando vacation.' There's so much to do.""Another major factor to consider: cost. It's cheaper to buy a multiday pass at one set of theme parks than it is to add a day at a different set of parks. Keep in mind: You can save on theme park tickets by purchasing them on the Orlando tourism bureau's website. Current offers include your fifth day free at Disney World and your third day free at Universal Orlando. See: 5 Hacks for Saving on Your Disney VacationWhy you should pick both If you're willing to sacrifice some time at one or both of the theme parks, you can squeeze both into one trip. ""A super ambitious family could get a fairly comprehensive overview of both places in about a week,"" Kelleher said.""The key is really in planning in advance -- and just having a plan in general,"" said Jeanenne Tornatore, senior editor for Orbitz.com. ""First, you should do research well ahead of your trip and, as a family, determine what everyone wants to see and do. This will help you map out your days around shows, events and even reservations at specific restaurants.""When my family set out on this year's Orlando vacation, we decided to hit both parks. Since we've been to Disney World and Universal Orlando before, we already had favorite rides in mind, which made it easier to plan out which experiences we were willing to skip with the time constraints. This is where both parks' mobile apps were helpful, because they allowed us to easily check wait times, make meal reservations and make our FastPass+ selections at Disney World. Purchasing an Express Pass at Universal, which starts at $34.99 per person, especially during a busy time like spring break, also shortens your time in line for major rides.To maintain our energy, we didn't get up early in the morning to be the first ones at the parks. Instead, we slept in a bit, arrived in the early afternoon to one park, headed back to the room for some rest and did most of our favorite rides at night. We love the nighttime atmosphere, plus the parks tend to clear out a bit with smaller children snug in their hotel beds.Whatever you decide, try not to fill every day of your vacation with a theme park visit. Instead, allow for at least one day of relaxation for every three days spent at the parks to keep everyone's sanity -- and health -- intact. As Tornatore put it, ""It's fun and wonderful, but it is exhausting!""See: Best Hotels in OrlandoAbout the author: Lyn Mettler is an Indianapolis-based freelance travel writer who blogs at Go To Travel Gal.

31,POLITICS,Kaiser Permanente Is Retaliating Against Mental Health Whistleblowers,"Sal Rosselli, ContributorPresident, National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW)",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kaiser-permanente-is-retaliating-against-mental-health-whistleblowers_b_7271352.html,"Last month, the Oakland-based health care provider fired a respected psychologist, Dr. Alex Wang, who had reported to state regulators a pattern of illegal and unnecessary delays in providing mental health care.",2015-05-27,2015-05-13-1431490922-7744404-20150512Kaiserleafleting.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-13-1431490922-7744404-20150512Kaiserleafleting-thumb.jpg,"Kaiser Permanente is retaliating against the whistleblowers who brought much-needed scrutiny to the HMO's severely understaffed mental health services. Last month, the Oakland-based health care provider fired a respected psychologist, Dr. Alex Wang, who had reported to state regulators a pattern of illegal and unnecessary delays in providing mental health care. Kaiser is also retaliating more broadly against whistleblowers by withholding from its mental health clinicians the standard annual wage increases it has given to 90,000 other employees. This week, clinicians have been picketing and leafleting at Kaiser facilities throughout the state to call on Kaiser to reinstate Dr. Wang. They are also calling on Kaiser to settle a contract with its mental health clinicians that addresses the severe understaffing that has caused lengthy and illegal delays for Kaiser patients and that does not punish caregivers for meeting the ethical obligations of their professions and exercising the clinical judgment for which Kaiser hired them. Clinicians picketed in Richmond and Oakland Wednesday and in San Francisco and Los Angeles on Thursday.""We have worked without a contract for three years while Kaiser has fought us tooth-and-nail on these patient care issues,"" said Clement Papazian, a psychiatric social worker at Kaiser's Oakland Medical Center. ""By refusing to address our concerns through internal channels, they pushed us into the role of whistleblowers. Now they want to punish us for going public.""""We don't want to reward employees for the behavior of the last three years,"" Kaiser officials told clinicians in a recent meeting. In 2013, Dr. Wang, a psychologist at Kaiser's Fremont clinic, noted in a patient's chart, ""Patient should be seen sooner"" after discovering the patient would wait more than three weeks for a first-time appointment, which is a violation of state law. Kaiser disciplined Dr. Wang, claiming his clinical note was ""political speech,"" and for the next two years targeted Dr. Wang for a series of performance reviews that questioned his clinical judgment in advocating for more timely appointments for his patients.""The firing of Dr. Wang is like a punch to the face,"" said Dr. Andris Skuja, a psychologist at Kaiser's Oakland Medical Center. This multi-billion-dollar corporation has pounced on a thoughtful, dedicated therapist because he dared to stand up for patients who needed help. Kaiser managers and executives are scapegoating caregivers for management's casual disregard of the well-being of Kaiser patients. It's a calculated move designed to silence caregivers. What kind of care will Kaiser members get if their care providers are too scared to report violations? These delays and denials of care can have tragic consequences. Some patients have committed suicide while facing long waits for therapy appointments.The National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents Dr. Wang, has filed a whistleblower complaint with the California Attorney General. Three years ago, after Kaiser failed to act on its clinicians' documented claims, clinicians took their case to state's Department of Managed Health Care. The DMHC conducted its own investigation and in 2013 the agency not only affirmed the clinicians' allegations, but also fined Kaiser $4 million -- the second-largest fine in the DMHC's history -- for ""systemic"" violations of state laws governing timely access to care and issued a ""Cease and Desist Order"" that demanded that Kaiser stop breaking the law. For the next two years, Kaiser claimed to have fixed all the problems, but in February 2015, a second DMHC survey affirmed clinicians' allegations that Kaiser's violations persist. Meanwhile, the ""nonprofit"" HMO is enjoying record profits -- $1 billion in the first quarter of 2015 and more than $15 billion since 2010."

I live in the country which, as you've heard said countless times, gave birth to democracy, theater, the sciences, the arts and whatever else defines the culture of Western civilization.I live in the country that is the cradle of Western civilization. The country that has also loaned thousands of words to other languages because the meanings of these words were first defined by the human species in this country thousands of years ago. By my ancestors. These words, these meanings, which are priceless and which we lent to world, to the human race, without seeking anything in exchange. I live in Greece. I live in a country that cannot stay alive unless it borrows. I live in a country that has, that is obliged to have, its hand stretched out for alms. I live in the country of Socrates, Plato and Alexander the Great. I live in a country governed for decades by corrupt politicians, petty and unseemly people whose moral compass is self-interested and were elected democratically by petty and unseemly me. Self-interest. The vested interests of those who will cover for them. Their bosses are organizations, corporations, sovereign states. Unfortunately, their compass was never my country's interest. I live in a country that has the highest unemployment rate in the world, the highest paycheck deductions, the most expensive gasoline... and the list goes on. I live in a country that belongs to a continent with a Greek name. It's the name of the daughter of the Phoenician king and Telephassa who was abducted by Zeus and bore him three children. I live in a country that doesn't belong on this continent. A continent where the current definition of the word human and the meaning of humanity do not express me. I live in a country that is lapped by a beautiful sea. In this spectacular part of the world with thousands of breathtaking islands, shimmering sun and welcoming sea. In the sea in which over 1,500 people have drowned this year while trying to escape their fate of being born in a miserable land only to meet their end in a cemetery of souls known as the Mediterranean Sea. I live in this country and in a daze watch a cold-blooded murder as everything happening was and is predictable. Other nations' will and mobilization could've prevented it. But no. Some people, from the comfort of their living room sofa or sitting at their desk, express their concerns about how this could've been resolved. They're the same ones who don't want to fling off their jacket to dive into the sea in a bid to save even one human soul. They're the same ones who sit at their keyboards typing equations and figures into the computer to press for the payment of my country's debts to the IMF instead of pensions because the figures don't add up for the payment of both. I live in the country where some people may not receive their pensions in the months ahead. Pensions... money... for food... for medicine. I live in the country where people are becoming insane. Where people are losing their minds. I live in the country where a few days ago a father chopped up his 4-year-old daughter, cooked the pieces with potatoes and rice, then fed it to the dogs. The neighbors feared this little angel was being abused but didn't speak out of fear. Out of fear of becoming involved. The police station was thirty meters away...I live in the country where the Minister of Justice said he didn't think this beast had too long left to live and that he would be killed in jail. I live in the country where everyone awaits real justice be meted out from those whom the justice system put behind prison bars. And, of course, all those harboring this hope oppose the death penalty. I live in this country and I love living in it. Because it brings me face to face with human's darker side and I see what monsters we can become given the circumstances. I live in the country where prostitution on the street is off the charts. In the country where a woman gets 2.5 euros for every man who passes over her body. I live in the country where half of the prostitutes are Greek women. If their number was smaller or was zero, all may have been well in this country and I might not be writing this article. I live in this country and now that summer is approaching, you will come to enjoy the pleasures it has to offer. The sun and the sea. The dazzling afternoons and the smooth nights. The wine and the ouzo. The souvlaki with tzatziki and the moussaka. The dancing and the feasts. Our hospitality and perhaps even a summer romance. And most of all, our smile. Just keep one thing in mind...I live in the country where there's a lot hidden behind this smile."
