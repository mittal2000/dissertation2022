There was no place really safe,"" she said.Rice's friend, 11-year-old Denise McNair, died in the blast along with 14-year-olds Carole Robertson, Addie Mae Collins and Cynthia Wesley. Their deaths at the hands of Ku Klux Klan members garnered national support for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.Events for the 50th anniversary of the bombing will include a screening of filmmaker Spike Lee's new documentary, ""Four Little Girls,"" and a memorial service on Sunday scheduled to include U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.Rice has a treasured photo of her friend accepting a kindergarten certificate from Rice's father, who was a pastor at another church. McNair had gone to preschool there. McNair's father was the community photographer, documenting birthday parties and weddings in happier times.""Everyone in the black community knew one of those girls,"" Rice said.Her father told her the bombing had been done by ""hateful men,"" she said, but it was an act that later uncovered something ultimately good.""Out of great tragedy, people began to recognize our humanity, and it brought people together,"" said Rice.The bombing left its mark on her even as an adult, when as U.S. Secretary of State under President George W. Bush, she used the experience to understand the plight of Palestinian and Israeli victims of bombs and attacks during peace negotiations.""I told them I know what it is like for a Palestinian mother, who has to tell her child they can't go somewhere,"" Rice said, ""and how it is for an Israeli mother, who puts her child to bed and wonders if the child will be alive in the morning.""But with all of the progress made in civil rights during the 50 years since the blast, Rice cites education as the biggest impediment to equality in modern times.She expressed dismay at racial disparities in the quality of education for minorities and criticized the ""soft bigotry of low expectations"" in a system she said challenges black students less than others.""Even racism can't be an excuse for not educating our kids,"" she said. ""If a kid cannot read, that kid is done. A child in a bad school doesn't have time for racism to be eradicated. They have to learn today."" (Edited by Karen Brooks and Eric Walsh)"

Doing so nationwide would change the lives of America’s working poor.A June study by Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a national organization focusing on racial equity in the restaurant industry, found that (statistic #1) a $10.10 minimum wage would have pulled roughly 58 percent of the nation’s 10.4 million working poor out of poverty in 2011.The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines the working poor as such:""The working poor are persons who spent at least 27 weeks in the labor force (that is, working or looking for work) but whose incomes still fell below the official poverty level.""It should be noted that California’s $10 minimum wage, if enacted, would not become law until Jan. 1, 2016. By that time, rising prices may have limited the ability of a $10 minimum wage to pull the working poor out of poverty (remember, the ROC United study is based on 2011 data).Many in California will certainly welcome the change, inflation or not. According to a May report, cited by the Los Angeles Times, some one-third of the state's working families qualify as low-income, and (statistic #2) California has the highest total number of working poor families in the country. Gov. Jerry Brown said in a statement Wednesday that a bill to raise the state’s minimum wage to $10 per hour was “overdue.” The bill was passed by the state’s legislature Thursday and now awaits the governor’s official approval. Certain states index their minimum wages and could also theoretically reach the $10 plateau by 2016. But the California bill would make the state the first to guarantee it, according to the Wall Street Journal. President Barack Obama pushed for a $9 minimum wage in his 2012 State of the Union address. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 and hasn’t been increased since 2009."

The 20-year-old singer's new release ""Wrecking Ball"" is on tap to nab the No. 1 spot on next week's Hot 100 chart, potentially knocking Perry's ""Roar"" off its throne after two weeks. The prediction comes from Billboard, which will release the updated Hot 100 on Wednesday. The win arrives largely thanks to the record-shattering views for ""Wrecking Ball."" The video premiered Monday and became the most-viewed Vevo clip within 24 hours, trumping the record previously held by One Direction. Those views, which have since risen to more than 85 million and will be factored into Billboard's calculations for the most popular song, will likely help to provide Cyrus with her first No. 1 single.Industry experts anticipate that ""Ball"" could sell as many as 400,000 downloads by Sunday, when the tracking period for the next chart ends. If the song doesn't manage to crack the top spot, it will likely be due to airplay. ""Roar"" is expected to surpass its radio figures without any contest, which makes sense given the continued airwave dominance of Cyrus' ""We Can't Stop."" Cyrus has come close to the top spot on the Hot 100 a few times already, first with 2009's ""The Climb,"" which peaked at No. 4. ""Party in the U.S.A."" debuted that same year to a No. 2 summit, while ""We Can't Stop"" managed to hit the same pinnacle in July before descending.

Heavy rains for the better part of week has fueled widespread flooding and evacuations in numerous Colorado towns, with the area reportedly already having received 15 inches of rain. Photo by Marc Piscotty/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb142942200004301db40b0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From Climate Central's Andrew Freedman:The Boulder, Colo. area is reeling after being inundated by record rainfall, with more than half a year’s worth of rain falling over the past three days. During those three days, 24-hour rainfall totals of between 8 and 10 inches across much of the Boulder area were enough to qualify this storm as a 1 in 1,000 year event, meaning that it has a 0.1 percent chance of occurring in a given year.At least four people have been confirmed dead so far, and thousands have been evacuated from their homes and businesses. All along Colorado’s Front Range from Denver northward to Boulder and in nearby areas, small creeks have been transformed into raging rivers, and surges of water, mud, and debris have blasted their way through canyons, at one point trapping a firefighter on a treetop before being rescued. Numerous longstanding records have been smashed, including the all-time 24-hour rainfall record in Boulder. “This is clearly going to be a historic event,"" National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini said in an interview. “The true magnitude is really just becoming obvious now.” Uccellini said the Weather Service has initiated a review of its performance leading up to and during the event. Although the potential for heavy rainfall was in the agency's forecasts a week in advance, he said, “Clearly the magnitude of the rainfall and the repetivieness of it in some critical areas was not pinpointed” well ahead of time. Uccellini said that this event will be the new historical high water mark for many affected rivers and streams. In a technical discussion on Thursday, the NWS described the rainfall amounts as ""biblical.""On average, Boulder gets about 1.7 inches of rain during September, based on the 1981-2010 average. So far this month, Boulder has received 12.3 inches of rain. This smashes the record for the wettest month ever in Boulder, which was set in May 1995 when 9.59 inches of precipitation fell — and September isn’t even half over! Not only that, but the average yearly rainfall in Boulder is 20.68 inches. This means that Boulder picked up well over half its annual precipitation in just a couple of days. This comes on the heels of a summer when Boulder experienced a moderate drought according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. This summer also featured the Colorado's most destructive wildfire on record.During the past couple of weeks, the weather across the West has featured both an active Southwest Monsoon and a broad area of low pressure at upper levels of the atmosphere, which has been pinned by other weather systems and prevented from moving out of the region. It was this persistent low pressure area that helped pull the moisture out of the tropics and into Colorado. Signs point to the tropical Pacific being the source of the abundant moisture according to the University of Wisconsin’s Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies. From there, the moisture plume was transported northeastward, over Mexico and into Texas, and then northward by upper level winds.This tropical air mass, which is more typical of the Gulf Coast than the Rocky Mountains, has been forced to move slowly up and over the Front Range by light southeasterly winds. This lifting process, known as orographic lift, allowed the atmosphere to wring out this unusually bountiful stream of moist air, dumping torrents of rain on the Boulder area for days on end. There was also broader-scale lifting of the air that resulted in heavy rain in areas of eastern Colorado and western Kansas as well.According to meteorologist Jeff Masters of Weather Underground, the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, or ""precipitable water,"" as measured by a weather balloon over Denver on Sep. 12, reached record values for the month of September. Water vapor satellite loop from Sept. 12, 2013 showing the plume of moisture directed at Colorado. Credit: CIMSSThe National Weather Service (NWS) said in an online discussion on Friday that the amount of precipitable water in the air over Colorado is still at record levels for this time of year, which is an indication that the potential for heavy rainfall remains high.Colorado has a long and tragic history of flash flood events, most notably the Big Thomson Canyon Flood in 1976, which resulted in 139 deaths after a slow-moving thunderstorm dumped a foot of rain in just four and a half hours, causing a massive wall of water to blast through the canyon. According to the NWS forecast office in Denver/Boulder, the river stage at the North Fork of the Big Thompson river so far has exceeded the Big Thompson Flood of 1976 by more than one foot. Enough rain fell between Sept. 10-12 to turn 2012 from one of Boulder's driest years into a year that, so far, is rivaling its wettest on record. Credit: Dennis Adams-Smith/Climate Central.Did Climate Change Make This Event More Likely?It will take climate scientists many months to complete studies into whether manmade global warming made the Boulder flood more likely to occur, but the amount by which this event has exceeded past events suggests that manmade warming may have played some role by making the event worse than it would have otherwise been.Considering that this flood event occurred in the backyard of some of the world's top climate researchers, it is likely that this event will be closely researched. Boulder is home to several major weather and climate research institutions, including the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the Earth System Research Laboratory, both of which were forced to close due to flooding.Extreme rainfall events have become more frequent across the U.S. during the past several decades in part due to manmade global warming. Increasing air and ocean temperatures mean that the air is generally carrying more water vapor than it used to, and this moisture can be tapped by storm systems to yield rain or snow extremes. Trends in extreme precipitation events vary by region, though, and in general the biggest increases have taken place in the Midwest and Northeast. However, most parts of the U.S. have seen an increase in extreme precipitation events, according to the draft National Climate Assessment report that was released this past January. The report goes on to note that in the future, ""increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected for most U.S. areas.” The increase in the most extreme precipitation events (99th percentile) since 1950. Credit: Climate Central/National Climate AssessmentAn increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events is expected to take place even though annual precipitation amounts are projected to decrease in the Southwest. Colorado sits right along the dividing line between the areas where average annual precipitation is expected to increase, and the region that is expected to become drier as a result of climate change. That may translate into more frequent, sharp swings between drought and flood, as has recently been the case. Last year, after all, was Colorado's second-driest on record, with the warmest spring and warmest summer on record, leading to an intense drought that is only just easing. Although the overall climate of the Southwest may become drier over the coming decades, a greater proportion of the rain that does fall could be in the form of heavy precipitation events. “... Heavy downpours will account for increasingly large portions of the total precipitation in regions such as the Southwest, where total precipitation is projected to decrease,” the report said.Previous studies have found that global warming made some extreme rainfall and flood events more likely, including major flooding in the U.K. in 2000. Some recent work has found mixed evidence about whether warming played a significant role in other flood events, though, such as the Queensland floods in Australia in 2011-12.The biggest and most consequential rise in flood risk may take place outside the U.S., in countries that don’t have as much of a capacity to bounce back from such disasters, however. A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change on June 9 found that flood frequency as well as the number of people at risk of inundation from flood events are both likely to increase as the world continues to warm, but most especially in developing countries in Southeast and South Asia.

Too many things can happen, and most of them bad. (AP Photo/Dave Martin, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb70c0d2200004301dcf854.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dave Miller, National Football Post  With the game everyone has been waiting for since last season just a few days away, let's take a look at what Alabama head coach Nick Saban, defensive coordinator Kirby Smart and the Crimson Tide defense may have in store for the team's contest against Johnny Manziel and Texas A&M in College Station.Expect plenty of T.J. Yeldon and Co.: All of the talk about Georgia's Todd Gurley being the best running back in the country has been legit. His big runs against Clemson and South Carolina proved as much, especially because the sophomore back was playing at well below 100 percent. But because he didn't have a great game against Virginia Tech in the opener, Yeldon has seemingly taken a back seat in the current national conversation about the best tailbacks. That should end this weekend. The Crimson Tide will look to exploit an Aggies run defense that has looked porous this year, as it struggled against Rice and Sam Houston State. A&M allowed 240 yards on the ground last week to the Bearkats. I know that the Aggies defense was missing several starters throughout the first two games, but it's not going to be a strength this season. And behind Yeldon, Jalston Fowler and young backs Alton Tenpenny and Derrick Henry, the Tide should be able to move the chains and keep the A&M offense off of the field. The ground attack will also open up the vaunted 'Bama play-action pass game. This is a perfect spot for Yeldon to enter the early season Heisman Trophy conversation.An improved offensive line: The Tide broke in three new starters along the offensive line in the season opener against Virginia Tech, and it did not fare very well against Bud Foster's stout front seven. Junior left tackle Cyrus Kouandjio, junior left guard Arie Kouandjio, sophomore center Ryan Kelly, senior right guard Anthony Steen and junior right tackle Austin Shepherd could only pave the way for the Tide offense to rush for 96 yards on 38 carries one year after the team averaged 226.5 yards per game on the ground. So new offensive line coach Mario Cristobal certainly had his hands full during the team's bye week. Improved communication is needed for the unit, which really only occurs through actual game reps. Since an O-Line needs to work as one, was one game and additional practice time enough? It helps that Virginia Tech may be the best front the team sees on the regular season slate, with the exception being perhaps LSU. A&M, meanwhile, isn't exactly the most stout front. The Aggies have given up an average of 273 yards on the ground in their first two games, although linebacker Steven Jenkins and defensive end Gavin Stansbury will be back from suspension. Creating holes for Yeldon and the Tide's backs is crucial, but so is protecting quarterback AJ McCarron, who was sacked four times against the Hokies.Using a linebacker to spy on Manziel: The most challenging aspect for defenses when playing A&M is stopping a spread passing team that can effectively run the football. The Tide defenders need to make sure that they remain disciplined on pass plays so Manziel will stay in the pocket and not take off on the edge. The problem is that Manziel has improved as a passer after a summer of work with QB guru George Whitfield. It will be interesting to see how often A&M goes empty in the backfield and whether the Tide put an extra safety deep when going in man-to-man coverage. 'Bama would prefer not to have its second safety be an extra defender in the box. Keep an eye on where linebacker C.J. Mosley is lined up. The inside 'backer runs very well, so he is adept against the run and pass. Fellow linebacker Adrian Hubbard will also be on the spot because he will be asked to be a key component against the zone-read and make sure Manziel does not get outside on the edge. The versatile Hubbard should line up both at outside and inside linebacker as well as defensive end.Of course, stopping Manziel is easier said than done. But Saban and his staff will have had an entire offseason to devise a game plan that would help limit Manziel's effectiveness. We'll see what they have been able to come up with when the teams meet on Saturday afternoon.Dave Miller, the college football editor and writer for the National Football Post, is on Twitter @Miller_Dave."

Donna Shalala, who served as Secretary of Health and Human Services for eight years during the Clinton administration and is now the president of the University of Miami, has said that she discouraged sleep deprivation among her staff.""When I was Secretary of HHS, I used to tell my staff, 'President Clinton hired us for our judgment, not our stamina,'"" Shalala told The Huffington Post. And skimping on shuteye does significantly affect our judgment: One 1999 study suggested that just 24 hours of sleep loss can impair innovative thinking and flexible decision-making. Getting a good night's sleep -- the CDC recommends seven to nine hours per night for adults -- not only fosters greater innovation and better decision-making, but can also also boost mood, productivity, cognitive functioning and physical health.
