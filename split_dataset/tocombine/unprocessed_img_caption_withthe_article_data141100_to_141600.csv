Research shows that communicating effectively helps us better cope with stress, nurtures our relationships and enhances our health and self esteem. Those who have solid relationships where they can share their emotions and feel supported tend to live longer. Those who feel misunderstood report a higher rate of depression, which weakens the immune system and makes them more vulnerable to disease. (1) If more people knew this, I bet they'd get serious about having courageous conversations, no matter how awkward they might feel initially. Anyone can learn to communicate better, and a great place to start is with your own internal communication. When the internal signals you receive from your body match your values and the actions you take, you will likely feel calm, peaceful and aligned. When you're not aligned (in other words, when you override your body's signals and take action that is different from what you really want) you may feel overwhelmed, upset or disconnected. How could you possibly communicate effectively with others when you are ignoring what your own body is telling you? Listen to Your Body's SignalsYour body is sending you messages, whether you're aware of them or not. These physiological signals are unique for each individual. For example, some people experience a racing heart because they're nervous about having a tough conversation. Others feel low energy for the same reason. Stress may cause one person's stomach to churn and another to start sweating excessively. How does your body communicate with you and demand your attention? For a long time, I didn't recognize my own alarm signals. As a physician, I had learned to override by body's signals to endure a rigorous training with 36-hour continuous shifts. My throat used to tighten up so much that I'd have to leave the hospital to get fresh air whenever our chief asked, ""Who is going to volunteer to cover the night shift?"" Still, I would often commit to the extra shifts even when I was exhausted, just because I wanted to be perceived as a team player. Physical signals from your body can mean that you need medical attention, so always make sure to get checked out by your health professional first. I consulted two physicians who verified there was nothing physically wrong with my throat. It was only then that I realized I was ignoring my body's messages. When I said yes to the team, I was saying no to my own self-care. Now that I can decipher my body's signals, my throat constriction acts as a friendly reminder not to over commit. Whatever the signal, the message is clear. Your body is talking to you.  Are you listening?To tune in to your body, consider these three questions: 1. In what circumstance do you experience the most difficulty communicating? 2. What physical signals from your body tell you that it's challenging? 3. What do you do with that information?Recognize Your Numbing StrategiesOur body's physiological signals (e.g., jaw clenching, stomach churning), can be uncomfortable. Rather than listening to these internal signals, we often use our own time-tested numbing strategies that work -- temporarily, anyway. This is how we ignore the messages coming from our bodies, rather than taking the time to address the root cause. Do any of these common strategies sound familiar?The Sugar-Caffeine Buzz Strategy -- My presentation got criticized in front of everyone -- I feel sick to my stomach. I need a chocolate chip cookie and a double latte so I can get back to work.The Numb It Out Strategy -- I've been in this relationship way too long. I don't want to deal with it today. Every muscle in my body feels tense. A few glasses of wine will take the edge off and get me through the night. The Denial Strategy -- My virtual world is much easier to deal with. My real life gives me a headache -- literally. If I call my brother, he'll probably ask if he can borrow money again. Let me see what's happening online. Whether you use sugar and caffeine, numb out with alcohol or simply avoid the conversation all together, these strategies all have something in common. They work -- for a few minutes -- to change how you feel. And if you're really good at it, they work for months and even years. Call them what you will, the truth is they're all Band-Aids. They are temporary strategies that don't solve the underlying problem that our bodies are trying to alert us to. Once you are able to recognize and decipher your body's signals for the warnings that they are, you are better prepared to engage in effective communication. To identify your strategies, consider these three questions: 1. When you've agreed to do something you didn't want to do, what brings you comfort? (That's your strategy!) 2. If you gave the strategy a name, what would it be? 3. How long is the strategy effective?Friend YourselfTo ""friend"" another nowadays takes the click of a mouse. To friend yourself is a much more difficult task. It means considering your own needs and wants as you engage with the world. It's a delicate balance and a constant negotiation. It's also learned behavior; because it's not something we typically learn growing up. Thanks to Facebook, Twitter, and our smart phones making us available 24/7, balancing work and home life is getting tougher every day. Yes, we're mobile, but are we ever really off? As the world becomes more and more connected, isn't it astonishing that many of us manage to stay current with the status updates of our 500-plus Facebook friends? Yet when was the last time you checked your body's status update? It's probably time to friend yourself.Join on the comments below and tell me: 1.

Fernandez was previously prescribed a month of rest by doctors, but had started experiencing a tingling feeling in her arm.""The initial recommendation for rest and observation issued on Saturday … was modified,"" according to a statement from Fundacion Favaloro hospital, Reuters reported. ""Considering these symptoms, the president's medical team is suggesting surgery.""Fernandez's condition may have been caused by a fall she had in August, where she hit her head, according to Reuters. BBC News reported that a scan taken at the hospital revealed the subdural hematoma; she went to the hospital because of headache complaints and to check up on her irregular heartbeat. Subdural hematomas are considered emergency conditions, and most often happen after a head injury. Acute subdural hematomas, which occur after a serious head injury, involve blood filling the brain. When this happens, pressure is put on the brain tissue, which can lead to brain injury, the National Institutes of Health reported. The University of California, Los Angeles Neurosurgery department explained that surgery is often the best route of treatment for this kind of subdural hematoma. Subacute subdural hematoma is similar to acute hematoma, but it may take longer -- days or weeks, even -- for the symptoms to appear, the Mayo Clinic noted. Chronic subdural hematomas occur after a more minor head injury, and can even go unnoticed for days to weeks. These types of subdural hematomas occur when a blood clot slowly forms on the brain's surface, according to the University of California, Los Angeles Neurosurgery department.  "

In a confessional new interview with The Guardian, the Victoria's Secret supermodel remembers getting the kind of drastic early-career diet advice we hear about all too often. At the tender age of 15, Rosie recalls that one agent instructed her to subsist on a scarce diet. Thankfully, Huntington-Whiteley was smart enough to know better than to listen:When she was starting out, one agent advised her to eat ""a single piece of sushi a day"". ""My eloquent response was: 'Go fuck yourself!'""We're relieved that Rosie had the courage and conviction to stand up for herself, seeing as many young models feel pressured to reach an unhealthy body weight in order to succeed in the industry. Last week, we heard model Georgina Wilkin's story of receiving similar advice at 15, which spurred on her eight-year battle with anorexia. And models aren't the only ones getting diet advice; Jennifer Lawrence met similar body criticism early in her career, too. Now, Lawrence insists, she'd respond to such advice with the same colorful words Rosie shared.Yet Rosie is hopeful for today's rising class of models. Thanks to an increase in press coverage, not to mention their own active presences on social media, Huntington-Whiteley insists that the industry no longer views models as disposable clothes hangers, but as three-dimensional people instead. ""Everybody wants to know the models,"" she tells The Guardian. ""You're more real now than ever... It's more expected now for supermodels to be smart, to have opinions, to have a personality.""We couldn't agree more -- here's to learning more about the brains behind these beauties!Rosie's rise to supermodeldom:Want more?

She is also a graduate student, a single mother to a 2-year-old, and a recipient of WIC assistance -- the Women, Infant and Children nutrition program threatened by the government shutdown. At first it looked as if some states would stop providing resources to 9 million mothers immediately, but late last week it was announced that emergency funding was sufficient to last through the month. Either way, the response around the country has been in the form of outrage from politicians (some of whom have regularly voted against WIC funding during the year, and in favor of the shutdown, but I digress...) and generosity from individuals, who have begun to organize collections of formula and baby food to fill any possible gap. Around naps and writing her dissertation, Lawson collected links together into a guide for those in need and those wanting to donate. Some of the sites have been set up specifically to meet the demand created by the shutdown, and others are existing food pantries that will try to fill the gap. You can find the result here.
