0,POLITICS,A Shocking Number Of States Don't Protect Unpaid Interns From Discrimination And Sexual Harassment,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unpaid-interns-harassment_n_7453826.html,,2015-05-27,"Supporters for financial aid for non-citizen college students rally at the state Capitol, Tuesday, May 20, 2014, in Hartford, Conn. (AP Photo/Jessica Hill)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fc592400005100990091.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Connecticut's House of Representatives unanimously approved a bill on Tuesday that would protect unpaid interns from workplace harassment and discrimination. The state Senate has already passed the bill, which means it is now heading to the desk of Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy. If the governor approves the legislation, his state would become just the seventh state (including the District of Columbia) to extend such protections to unpaid workers, who often find themselves vulnerable to predatory superiors. Malloy's office told The Huffington Post he is reviewing the language in the bill.According to the News-Times, a local newspaper, some Connecticut lawmakers ""were surprised that interns are not protected from discrimination and workplace retribution."" What's more surprising, though, is that such laws haven't picked up traction around the country. Unpaid interns are vulnerable because they are not technically “employees” under the federal Civil Rights Act, which means they’re not protected by bodies like the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Interns must receive “significant remuneration"" for the commission to consider them employees. But some states have started modifying their laws to address the disparity between paid and unpaid workers. Below is a map of the small cohort Connecticut would join if Malloy signs the bill:Unpaid interns often do not report instances of discrimination or harassment since, in most states, they could face retaliation if they pursue a complaint. And there's a gender element to the policy issue: About three-quarters of unpaid interns are women, who are disproportionately affected by workplace sexual harassment. Legislators in Michigan and New Jersey have also attempted to pass anti-discrimination and harassment laws, though they have not yet succeeded. "

""You have to come to terms with getting older and not trying to fight it,"" Clooney said in an interview with the BBC, adding that there's ""nothing fun"" about the process. ""I'm a big believer in the idea that you can't try to look younger. You just have to try to look the best you can at the age you are."" It's working out pretty well for the 54-year-old, who insists he won't be taking any extreme measures to look more youthful. When asked about plastic surgery or dyeing his hair, Clooney said, ""Clearly, I haven't. For me, it isn't an issue or an option ... it wouldn't make much sense.""Of course, it's easy for him to say. The star is known for his trademark silver-flecked hair and was even voted the world's top ""MAG"" -- that's man aging gracefully, according to one poll. We couldn't agree more. His final word of advice for embracing age? ""You have a couple options, which is get older or die,"" he said. Plain and simple.All we can say is Amal is one lucky lady.

2,EDUCATION,Diversity in the Legal Profession Begins With Law School,"Tamesha Keel, ContributorCEO, LawPortunities",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diversity-in-the-legal-pr_b_7346644.html,"Title VII of The Civil Rights Act of 1964 created the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission to ensure equal, employment advancement for all and makes employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin illegal.",2015-05-27,2015-05-20-1432155975-7179210-multiethnicteamArticle201404071258.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-20-1432155975-7179210-multiethnicteamArticle201404071258-thumb.jpg,"Title VII of The Civil Rights Act of 1964 created the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission to ensure equal, employment advancement for all and makes employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin illegal. However, substantial progress in increasing the number of diverse attorneys within the American legal profession has been abysmally slow since the Act's passage.Diverse attorneys have faced incredible obstacles in advancing professionally when compared to their non-diverse counterparts. Consequently, attorneys within the American legal profession do not adequately reflect the diversity of the current population. The legal profession severely lags behind other professions when it comes to diversity and inclusion, which is ironic considering the nature of the profession. Unfortunately, this trend will continue unless something is done to reverse it.The good news is that minority students are applying and being accepted into law schools more than ever before. For example, during the 2013-2014 academic year, minorities comprised 26.9 percent of total J.D. enrollment and 29.1 percent of first year enrollment. While these stats show a promising trend of increased diversity within law schools, more significant gains must be made because law school is a crucial gateway in the legal profession's diversity pipeline.In the midst of declining enrollment, some schools are looking to diverse candidates merely as a means to fill potentially empty seats in their first year classes and replace lost tuition revenue. However, the better and more honorable practice would be to actively enroll promising, diverse students, coupled with diversity and cultural competence programming, to enrich the educational environment for all students. Diversity not only makes good business sense, it is also paramount in demonstrating that fair representation and equal access are necessary for justice, a foundational tenet of the legal profession. Developing a diverse and inclusive law school community is critical for creating a richer experience and maintaining relevance. This experience translates into better lawyers with deeper understanding of the profession's global realities, more capabilities in representing a diverse client base, and heightened cultural intelligence - skills that are absent without multicultural experiences. Law schools are the legal profession's pipeline, and should set the tone for the profession's future. The challenge of recruiting, retaining, and training a diverse workforce should be intricately integrated within law schools' entire framework (i.e., through admissions, courses, initiatives, experiential learning opportunities, and career development) and sustained in conjunction with key partnerships from bar associations and legal employers. If law schools have not provided significant traction on this important issue, how can the burden be placed entirely on others when training and professional development begins in law school?As champions of justice, law schools need to facilitate and encourage dialogue around diversity and inclusion, not shy away from potentially heated topics, such as race. For example, law professors should strive to incorporate critical analysis conversations about the case of Freddie Grey and the Baltimore City Police Department within the context of their classes. Clearly, the discourse here is that these teachable moments within the curriculum to provide real, practical solutions to facilitate legal change are not being done enough or at all.Cultivating a diverse and inclusive law school environment that best funnels qualified, culturally dexterous professionals into the profession is invaluable to the community at large, mirrors our melting pot society, and is pivotal in diversifying the legal profession. Using a more strategically ingrained approach should be a solution to positively impact the legal profession's lack of diversity."""

GLAAD Vice President of Programs Zeke Stokes said in a statement: ""Coach Swinney has an obligation to the players he leads and all students who attend Clemson to use his considerable profile to promote causes that bring us together, not tear us apart. The Palmetto Family Council's values are out of line with the values of love and acceptance for all people, and I hope the Coach will reconsider the message that his alignment with them sends.""Earlier, LGBT supporters, led by student William Ta'oma, launched a Change.org petition calling for Swinney to reconsider the invitation: ""As a prominent representative of the University, Dabo Swinney's appearance and fundraising for the Palmetto Family Council will serve to promote these ideas and actions which harm the mission and goals of the University and the interests of the student body.""Swinney said he understood that he was being feted for his All-In Foundation charity and emphasized that he had no affiliation with the organization.""My scheduled participation in this event has been perceived incorrectly as an endorsement of certain viewpoints and has entered the political arena,"" he said. ""I have been out of town since last Thursday and am disappointed that this has become a distraction for me, my team and many others. I have been and continue to be very open about my personal beliefs. However, I do not inject those beliefs or the work of the foundation into the political process."" (See Swinney's full statement at the bottom of the article.)Swinney's invitation drove at least one politician to join the cause to make him reconsider. The top Democrat in the South Carolina House, Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, told The State, “I cannot fathom why Coach Swinney or anyone else would knowingly assist a group whose mission is to fight against equal rights and equal treatment of others.”But Palmetto Family Council President Oran Smith explained to the paper that Swinney was being honored for his Christian beliefs and ""should be free to speak where he would like to.”Swinney has been accused of fostering an overtly Christian environment in a public university, but answered his critics, ""When we get out on the football field, it's not about if you're a Christian, it's about who's the best player.""Here's Swinney's full statement:I was recently selected by the Palmetto Family Council, an organization with which I have no association, as their “South Carolina Family Champion of 2015” and was invited to receive this recognition at an event sponsored by the group on June 2. I had no idea that I was being invited into a political controversy. It was my understanding that the nomination and selection for this award was based on the work done by our All In Foundation and the difference it is making in our community. My acceptance of this award was to be on behalf of all the volunteers that make our foundation a success. The work of our foundation is intended to build a better community and be a positive influence.  Recently, my scheduled participation in this event has been perceived incorrectly as an endorsement of certain viewpoints and has entered the political arena. I have been out of town since last Thursday and am disappointed that this has become a distraction for me, my team and many others. I have been and continue to be very open about my personal beliefs. However, I do not inject those beliefs or the work of the foundation into the political process."

5,MEDIA,How The New York Times Staked Out A Swiss Hotel To Cover FIFA Arrests,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-times-fifa-arrests_n_7452148.html,,2015-05-27,"ZURICH, SWITZERLAND - MAY 27: General view of the hotel Baur au Lac Zurich on May 27, 2015 in Zurich, Switzerland. Swiss police on Wednesday raided a the Zurich hotel to detain top FIFA football officials as part of a US investigation. (Photo by Philipp Schmidli/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c7d2200000e50000deec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Around 4 a.m. Wednesday, New York Times reporters Michael Schmidt and Sam Borden arrived at a five-star hotel in Zurich and tried to get breakfast.It was an unusual place for the pair to be, and not simply because breakfast wouldn't be served for a couple more hours. Schmidt covers the FBI from Washington D.C., and Borden, a European sports correspondent based in Paris, should have been at the French Open. But the reporters were staking out the Baur au Lac hotel to witness the anticipated arrests of top officials with FIFA, soccer’s international governing body. Just before midnight at Times headquarters, or dawn in Zurich, the paper reported that Swiss authorities had arrested seven top FIFA officials on corruption charges stemming from an FBI investigation. The Department of Justice had indicted them and seven others on charges that included racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering. Matt Apuzzo and William Rashbaum, who cover the Justice Department and New York federal law enforcement, respectively, co-wrote the bombshell story with Schmidt and Borden.""We weren’t sure how this was going to happen, whether they were going to land a helicopter on the roof about to bust through a door with SWAT teams,"" Schmidt told The Huffington Post by phone from Zurich. ""Ultimately, it was a bunch of friendly faced Swiss hipsters.""Similarly, Borden told HuffPost that he was struck by how quietly the arrests were conducted. ""I watched one of the guys being detained,"" he said. ""To me, if you were sleeping in the room next to this guy, you wouldn’t have been woken up.""While the arrests didn't have the makings of a big-budget action movie, they will have major ramifications for the soccer world, especially with powerful FIFA head Sepp Blatter up for re-election on Friday. The reporters had prime vantage points to give the play-by-play on Twitter, and thousands of users retweeted the descriptions and images they posted.Schmidt, who recently broke the news that Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton exclusively used a private email account while serving as secretary of state, said tweeting the arrests ""was a different type of journalistic experience than a lot of things I’ve done before."" Schmidt said he doesn't typically tweet photos of a story playing out in real time. Borden tweeted a short video clip from the scene, though neither reporter used live-streaming apps like Periscope or Meerkat to broadcast what was happening. The Times also had a photographer posted outside the hotel to capture the proceedings.Clearly the Times suspected that arrests could be taking place in Zurich, as top FIFA executives met in the city, when it sent Schmidt and Borden there on Monday. But the editors and reporters who worked on the story pushed back against any suggestion they were fed the scoop. ""Nobody pulls you aside and says 'Here's what you need to know,'"" Apuzzo told HuffPost. ""It's a lot of looking for signals, making educated guesses, and reacting accordingly. Luckily the Times is a place that will put Mike Schmidt and Sam Borden on planes to Switzerland and hope it works out. Because you don't know what you're going to find until you get there.""On Twitter, Apuzzo rejected one journalist's claim that the Times was given a ""ride along"" with authorities. Apuzzo acknowledged that the paper ""ultimately figured out” when the raid would take place, but suggested that information was gathered through reporting.Sports editor Jason Stallman, who oversaw the coverage all night from the Times' newsroom, said there was no tip indicating a specific time, place or individuals involved. He said the Times had a breakthrough on the story last week, and reporters worked on it for several days after that. By Tuesday evening, Stallman “had a firm understanding of what was going to transpire.”Stallman understandably declined to get into specifics about the paper's sources, but described the reporters' effort as ""a master class in source work"" across several cities. He also complimented Schmidt and Borden for their observations at the hotel, given that The Times doesn't cover the FIFA executive committee in any sustained way and because those arrested aren't easily recognizable. ""It’s not like they’re looking at Alex Rodriguez or Lance Armstrong or readily identifiable faces walking by,"" he said. The Times reporters finally did get breakfast at Baur au Lac, roughy five and a half hours after arriving. Schmidt, who ate several croissants and slices of lemon cake, said the famished pair were seated near some nervous FIFA executives. "
6,BUSINESS,The Road Map to Scale Your Company,"David Finkel, ContributorBest-selling author and one of the nation's foremost business ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-road-map-to-scale-your-company-_b_7452138.html,"I was hosting my radio show, Scale Your Business, when the subject of the lifecycle of a successful business came up, and what the predictable needs were at each stage to scale it were.",2015-05-27,2015-05-27-1432741554-4355273-LevelThreeRoadMap2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-27-1432741554-4355273-LevelThreeRoadMap2-thumb.jpg,"I was hosting my radio show, Scale Your Business, when the subject of the lifecycle of a successful business came up, and what the predictable needs were at each stage to scale it were.Here is a quick summary of the answer I gave on air. Use this level-by-level, stage-by-stage progression to help you accelerate your growth and build a business you can one day sell, scale, or even own passively.To be clear, in the early years of your business, you're naturally the main engine driving your business forward. You'll wear all the hats at various times, and you'll have few formal structures and systems within your organization upon which you can truly rely. But as it matures, you'll face a crucial decision point at which you can settle for owning a Level Two job or instead choosing to raise your business to be a strong and independent entity that benefits from your involvement but is ultimately independent of it. Just like your goal as a parent is raising kids who can eventually stand on their own--independent and self-supporting -- so your goal is to create an organization with the systems, team, and controls that allow it to stand on its own.The traditional Level Two approach is for you the owner to work harder, to do more--to work at the job of your business.The Level Three solution is for you to do less and get your business to do more. Okay, here is a deeper look at the Level Three Road Map™:Level One: Start Up Business: Planning Your Business and Proving It's Viable At Level One, you're designing and planning your new start-up. You're gathering your initial team, raising any required start-up capital, and executing your launch plan. Your focus at Level One is to plan your new business and get immediate market feedback to learn if your business concept and model is economically viable. This is a fancy way to say you'll be testing your product or service to see if you can sell it at a price that allows your business to be profitable.Level Two Early Stage: Making Your Business SustainableFocus: Securing your early clients and becoming profitable.Leverage Points: Your ability to change and adapt, keeping costs low and your business lean.Fresh in the marketplace, an Early Stage Level Two business has just started actively marketing and selling its products/services. This is the time to learn your business and market, and if needed, discover and cure any fatal flaws in your business model or in the way your targeted customers perceive the value you're creating.Your early focus while launching a business isn't on building the perfect product or service, but rather on figuring out how you can get people to buy. Too many entrepreneurs get caught in the trap of making the perfect gizmo, but never actually sell that gizmo in large enough numbers to ensure a profit. Know that at this stage in your business's growth, you'll be wearing just about every hat in the business. That's okay for now, but as you move toward Middle Stage Level Two, you'll need to find ways to leverage your personal production for the business by hiring staff and building basic business systems.Remember, an Early Stage Level Two business is working to generate sales, establish a market position, and become a sustainable business. Level Two Middle Stage: An ""Owner Reliant"" CompanyFocus: Establishing your business's foundation; building your business's core systems and structureKey Leverage Point: Leveraging your time so you can invest at least 20 percent (one day a week) to building your business's core Characteristics of a Typical Middle Stage Level Two Business: • Business revolves around the owner. • Owner must show up each day or the business suffers from the absence. • Owner hits a revenue plateau; can't work any harder or put in any more hours. • Outside world -- especially customers -- identify the business with only the owner. Why do most businesses never make it past Middle Stage Level Two? Because the owners are entrenched in the traditional way of building a business for control and active cash flow based primarily on their personal production. Not only do they quickly max out on personal production, but what's worse is that every day, more and more of the know-how to run the business gets buried deeper in one person's head--instead of being captured in processes, procedures, and systems. Sadly, these typical Middle Stage Level Two business owners stay stuck at the tactical level of doing the job the business requires instead of creating the time and space to step back and build the business itself.  Middle Stage Level Two requires building your core systems, controls, and scalable solutions. The challenge is doing that while balancing the business's need for you to continue to lead its daily operation. This is a delicate balance between what your business needs today and what it will need tomorrow. Thankfully, you don't have to figure all this out yourself. Now that your business is profitable and you're confident it will survive, it's time to build your four core systems:1. Your system to consistently find prospects (lead generation).2. Your system to close sales (lead conversion).3. Your system to produce and fulfill on your core product or service (production/fulfillment).4. Your system to collect what you're owed (collections).These four systems - for finding leads, closing sales, producing your product or service, and collecting on your receivables -- are the four minimum requirements to have a sustainable business.Level Two Advanced Stage: A ""Rapid Growth"" BusinessFocus: Increasing your capacity and scaling your businessKey Leverage Point: Your key team members' time, talent, skills, and focusCharacteristics of a Typical Advanced Stage Level Two Business: • It's becoming more and more systems driven. (At least one or two of the five main areas of your business are managed by people other than you.) • Your revenue is starting to climb. • Your business may feel like it's bursting at the seams.One of the key steps at this point in your business's development is to enroll your team in building the systems, controls, and scalable solutions with you. Rather than regarding the team around you as a form of leverage that magnifies your personal reach and production, instead see them as partners in taking the business to the next level. As management guru Peter Drucker once said, ""The founder has to learn to become the leader of a team rather than a 'star' with 'helpers.'""Reaching Level Three requires finding and enlisting key members to ""own"" parts of your business. More important, it requires you to let go of control so your business can thrive without you. Rather than have all roads lead back to and through you like a hub in the middle of a wheel, encourage your team to work with each other directly. Grow their capacity to make their own decisions and take the initiative within the company. Remember, a business dependent on its owner--you--for its success becomes a prison that traps you. Plan for your great prison escape now by building your management team. Before long, you'll have key leaders in each of the five core pillars of your business: sales/marketing, operations, team, finance, and executive leadership. In addition, make sure that your leaders and team members have a unified vision of what the business is, where it's heading, and how you plan to get there. This lets you set clear priorities, assign responsibilities, and hold each other accountable for results.Level Three: An ""Exit Stage"" Business: Owning a Business that Gives You Freedom and Control Focus: To determine your desired exit strategy and clarify your personal roleCharacteristics of a Typical Level Three Business:• The business is run by a competent and winning management team independent of the owner (who may still fill one of the roles, but who has a replacement groomed and ready to step in).• The business runs smoothly whether the owner is there or not over an extended period of time (based on sound systems, intelligent controls, and scalable solutions).• Its clients look to the business, not the owner, to fulfill promises.The 3 Exit Strategies for You and Your Level Three Business:Exit Strategy 1: Sell Once you've built a Level Three business, you've created a valuable asset with clear market value. Selling your company is your way to harvest the equity you've built.Exit Strategy 2: Scale In the context of exiting, scaling means that you, the business owner, firmly decide to stay actively involved in the business and grow it magnitudes bigger. It may seem strange to call scaling an exit strategy, but many entrepreneurs who've built a Level Three business don't want to leave or sell it. Rather, they want to grow it to the next level, which we call scaling your business. This means you take a $15 million company and grow it to $150 million or $1.5 billion. This option gives you the greatest financial reward, but it also requires your continued commitment, often over five or ten years or even longer after your business has reached Level Three. Exit Strategy 3: Own Passively Once you've taken your business to Level Three, you can transition to a more passive role--owning the company without running it every day. If you choose this exit strategy, you'll enjoy the ongoing cash flow from the business without regularly coming into the office. You'll still have responsibilities, but from an owner's viewpoint, not a CEO's or a manager's viewpoint. I hope you use this summary of the lifecycle of a successfully scaled company to help you guide your journey to building a successful Level Three company.For more ideas on growing your business, including a free tool kit with 21 in-depth video trainings to help you scale your business and get your life back, click here."

The oyster scene is as vibrant and diverse as the city itself. You can find oysters from all over North America (and even a few from abroad) in a wide spectrum of raw bars and seafood eateries. No matter what you're in the mood for or who you're with, there's an oyster joint for you.SOLO DININGUpstate Craft Beer & Oyster Bar95 First Ave.; +1-917-408-3395I know I'm in good hands when I take a seat at the bar — that is, whenever I can get a seat! It's a popular spot with New Yorkers, so show up early and alone. If you're in the mood for an impromptu oyster and beer pairing, this is the place to go. DATE NIGHTMaison Premiere298 Bedford Ave.; Brooklyn; +1-347-335-0446I'm a sucker for the enchanting, old-world, luxury vibe. Cozy, candlelit booths set the scene for a romantic night out at this New Orleans-inspired oyster house. The oyster menu is extensive (there are more than 30 varieties) and the cocktails are divine.SEE & BE SEENLure Fishbar142 Mercer St.; +1-212-431-7676This subterranean restaurant embodies the fun and glamorous side of New York living. When I enter their seafood den, I can't help but look past the reservation table to see if I can spot a familiar face (it's a favorite hangout for celebs). For a more intimate experience, head to the back of the house and sit at the sushi bar. HAPPY HOURCull & Pistol75 Ninth Ave.; +1-212-255-5672My favorite thing to do is wander through Chelsea Market and end up at Cull & Pistol's bar with a platter of two dozen oysters. Their happy hour menu is one of the best in Manhattan — the entire selection of oysters is $1 per piece, which allows for an affordable feast.OUT-OF-TOWNERSGrand Central Oyster Bar & RestaurantLower Level, Grand Central Terminal, 89 E. 42nd St.; +1-212-490-6650I like to take friends from other countries to this iconic restaurant tucked below Grand Central. It's a gorgeous, historic venue with an impressively large menu showcasing tons of great seafood.More In A Half Shell: Check out the New York Oyster Map, a must-have guide to unlocking NYC's oyster scene.Read more on Fathom: Love Letter: Cochon's Oysters, The Best Crudo and Conversation in Maine, Little Black Book: Lobster Rolls on DeckJulie is an international oyster specialist, brand strategist, and freelance photographer based in New York City.

There is no longer one way to structure enterprise output. And as replicating success gives way to navigating it, what do we really need to be paying attention to as we build the most effective paths forward?",2015-05-27,2015-05-26-1432666409-8085906-uncorporateculture.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-26-1432666409-8085906-uncorporateculture-thumb.png," Business guru Peter Drucker called management ""the most important innovation of the 20th century."" It was well-justified praise. Techniques for running large corporations, pioneered by men like Alfred Sloan of General Motors and refined at a bevy of elite business schools, helped fuel a century of unprecedented global prosperity. But can this great 20th century innovation survive and thrive in the 21st? Evidence suggests: Probably not. ""Modern"" management is nearing its existential moment.Corporations, whose leaders portray themselves as champions of the free market, were in fact created to circumvent that market. They were an answer to the challenge of organizing thousands of people in different places and with different skills to perform large and complex tasks, like building automobiles or providing nationwide telephone service. Said another way, they were built to extract value at scale, as efficiently as possible. Now that the game is changing, so are our ways of leading.In recent years, most of the greatest management stories have been not triumphs of the corporation, but triumphs over the corporation. General Electric's Jack Welch may have been the last of the great corporate builders. But even Mr. Welch was famous for waging war on bureaucracy. Other management icons of recent decades earned their reputations by attacking entrenched corporate cultures, bypassing corporate hierarchies, undermining corporate structures, and otherwise using the tactics of revolution in a desperate effort to make the elephants dance. The best corporate managers have become, in a sense, enemies of the corporation. But why?The reasons for this are clear enough. Corporations are bureaucracies and managers are bureaucrats. Their fundamental tendency is toward self-perpetuation. They are, almost by definition, resistant to change. They were designed and tasked, not with reinforcing market forces, but with supplanting and even resisting the market. So what is the role of enterprise today? And more specifically...How should enterprises be organized to respond effectively? What is the role of organizational culture? How does that jibe with strategy + brand? What does it mean to design an inspiring culture code? And, how do emergent business structures factor in?? The single biggest reason companies fail, is that they over-invest in what is, as opposed to what might be. This is the core of the innovator's dilemma. The big companies Mr. [Clayton] Christensen studied failed, not necessarily because they didn't see the coming innovations, but because they failed to adequately invest in those innovations. To avoid this problem, the people who control large pools of capital need to act more like venture capitalists, and less like corporate finance departments. They need to make lots of bets, not just a few big ones, and they need to be willing to cut their losses. Which, necessarily, puts a whole new spin on what we've begun calling ""leadering"" (h/t to Peter Vanderauwera) - more on that to come. For now, this is summarized well in this recent report from consultants Wolff + Olins, based on interviews with 43 global CEOs:""Technology is changing culture everywhere in the world, leading to the emergence of a new model of leadership. For CEO's it's hard work - but worth it. They're finding that delicate balance between experimentation and stability, meeting targets and designing their machine. No longer ringmasters, these are leaders looking to people for creative responses to their searching questions. Conversely, employees are now more confident, more mobile, more demanding, more idealistic in some cases, and less willing to be company people. Employees, more than ever, are individualists.""Fundamentally, as transaction costs go down, mass collaboration tools accelerate and the need for both radical transparency and constant innovation become the norm, the role and structures of enterprise organizations have no choice but to mirror these realities.""Culture eats Strategy for Breakfast""Peter Drucker saw this wave coming when he made this declaration, and it's now a widely held belief that culture is the prime driver of organizational performance, with many companies confirming that more than anything else culture exerts the most powerful influence over behavior. (For a nice summary on the twelve reasons why, check out this thoughtful slideshare.)But what exactly do we mean by ""corporate culture""? There isn't a single directive or definition of what culture looks like in the workplace--each organization works differently to craft their own unique culture code--but as ex-IBM CEO Louis Gerstner explained in his account of his tenure at IBM, ""culture isn't just one aspect of the game; it is the game"". He adds, [because] ""in the end, an organization is nothing more than the collective capacity of its people to create value"".Meet the Top 25 Companies to Work ForSo who's doing this well? Glassdoor describes themselves as ""the world's most transparent career community that is changing the way people find jobs and companies recruit top talent. With a database of over 6 million company reviews, CEO approval ratings, salary reports, interview reviews and questions, benefits reviews, office photos and more, all of this information is shared entirely by those who know a company best -- the employees. Add to that millions of the latest jobs and you have a powerful resource for seeing which employers are hiring, what it's really like to work or interview there according to employees, and how much you could earn."" Using their database, they recently compiled a list of the Top 25 Companies to work for based on culture and values. It's a good barometer of what is working now.Corporate Culture hackers and managing to the ""HCD""I spent much of the past week with members of REX, the think and do tank formed to explore changes afoot as we move from transaction-based business models to relationship-centric ones. It's hard for most of us to imagine just how radically different things can and will look as structures are (re)built to earn trust and foster all the advances of a more open, social, transparent and continuously demanding society. Netflix and Google are among the growing number of companies that are sharing popular slideshare presentations on how they've built strong, responsive cultures.We invite you, however, to really think about what radical change in our organizational models could look like? A powerful example has been set by Ricardo Semler, a business visionary in Brazil who In the 1980′s took over his father's company and set about modernizing management practices to form a new kind of industrialized democracy that has seen the company grow across a variety of industries from $4 million 29 years ago to $1billion+ today; further, in the worst 10-year recession in Brazil's history, revenues grew 600%, profits were up 500%, and productivity rose 700%. How?Inspired by imagining what would happen to his company if he were hit by a truck, Semler decided that he would no longer manage to the lowest common denominator (LCD), but instead would lead from the highest common denominator (HCD); in other words, instead of assuming as CEO that he is the most motivated, qualified, invested, and experienced person to make decisions for the good of the company (old school), he realized that employees are inherently motivated and more than capable of making their own when empowered to do so (new school)--so that's what they do, from designing their own jobs and choosing their length of vacation time, to selecting their supervisors and defining salaries.In this inspiring TED talk, Semler describes this radical uncorporate culture (""how to run a company with-almost-no rules"") and how it has not only revolutionized business around the world, but is also now being applied to education.So as you can sense, if ""management"" is dead, then perhaps there is an bigger question: beyond the culture of a company, what should the structure itself be? What about Holacracy? Wirearchy? Democratic Workplaces? Will we all need to become ""Exponential Organizations""?Just as there are now seemingly infinite education ""pedagogies"", the same is happening to business. There is no longer one way to structure enterpise output. And as replicating success gives way to navigating it, what do we really need to be paying attention to as we build the most effective paths forward?"

Although the current system is designed to provide international students with the best higher education in the world, upon graduation many of these students' visas expire and they are faced with the possibility of deportation or enduring the long and uncertain process of applying for an H-1B visa. The irony: many of these students are ready and eager to put their education to use in the U.S. and contribute to its economy in industries from technology to finance to engineering. Yet despite broad bipartisan support to mend this broken system, very little has been done, resulting in nearly 100,000 rejected H-1B applications. It's time for change. If you or someone you know would like to share a story, please email tewfik@opedspace.com and tweet @opedspace using #freedom2innovate.Wojciech Osowiecki (New Haven, CT/Poland)I came to study at Yale University from Poland, because I wanted to seek out academic opportunities in the U.S. I was eager to experience the ""big world"" and I was not disappointed. My college turned out be a fantastic community where no one paid attention to my origin. I wish it could have stayed that way after graduation, but unfortunately, without the right immigration status, I didn't have the same chances on the job market. As a chemistry student, I wanted to apply for scientific fellowships to support my research, but I was ineligible for all major financial sources. I've been fortunate enough to enter a chemistry PhD program at UC Berkeley, but many other immigrants are not so lucky.As an international student in the U.S., I was granted the same privileges as American citizens but only on the campus ground. When summer approached and all my friends started talking about applying for internships, I have realized that many companies are not willing to go through the legal hassle of hiring an alien who requires a lot of additional paperwork. It hurts your future chances of applying for a full-time job, since your resume lacks necessary professional experience. And even if a company is willing to support you through a program called the OPT (Optional Practical Training), each month of work reduces the length of legal post-graduate employment, making planning for the future more and more stressful.It is unclear to me what my situation will look like after I finish my PhD program. The easiest way to stay here is continue on the path to professorship; unfortunately, only about 10 percent of graduate students end up landing a professorship. I am very interested in the industry and tech opportunities as I'm passionate about tackling the climate change issue. Sadly, no one has a clear understanding of how likely I am to land such a job since my chances are affected by the H-1B lottery visa or a slim chance of self-petitioning for the green card. The eligibility requires ""extraordinary ability in the sciences"" or the National Interest Waiver, which regardless of my faith in my skills, sounds daunting.The United States has one of the best scientific communities in the world, but in order to keep it this way, we must start thinking about the future. We must continue letting bright and talented people and their families stay in this country by fixing the H-1B lottery, clearing the green card backlog, and making it easier for students to stay and work after studying here.Jan Kolmas (Palo Alto, CA/Czech Republic)I came to the U.S. in August 2010 as an F-1 visa student. I was a freshman at Yale hoping to pursue a career in aerospace engineering. During my four years at Yale, I have learned what would never be possible back in the Czech Republic. However, I have also discovered that my aerospace career might not have a future in the U.S. Many aerospace as well as national institutes, such as NASA centers, are off limits for me because I am not a U.S. citizen. I could neither get an internship or a full time job at any of those places due to the restrictions of my F-1 visa.It is disappointing that U.S. does such a good job with attracting brains from overseas, but also does such a poor job in keeping them around. I am now pursuing my Masters in Aerospace Engineering at Stanford, but after I graduate I will only have 18 months to find an employer to sponsor me for a work permit. If I do not find an employer, I will take my education from Stanford and Yale to a different country.President Obama's executive actions are a first step for helping F-1 students like me. The actions will allow students to extend their time in the U.S. and keep contributing to this country after we earn our degrees. For STEM students like myself, executive action is important, but a legislative solution is needed to ensure the U.S. visa system works for all of the students it educates.By Alexandra Schuster for OpedSpace"

Made by artists who distance themselves from the commercial uses of 3D in motion pictures, television, advertising and gaming, the new 3D artists employ the same technology that the commercial industries use. The difference is the 3D-materialization artists extend the dematerializing values and strategies of Conceptual Art to digital imaging, narratives, mythopoetics, satires and paradigms that promote progressive and sustainable political, cultural and natural lifestyles for the present and future. The other Huffington Post features in the series include commentaries and criticisms on the 3D art of Claudia Hart, Kurt Hentschlaeger, Matthew Weinstein, and the bitforms gallery exhibition, Post Pictures: A New Generation of Pictorial Structuralists A related article includes the digital art of Morehshin Allahyari in a particularly global feminist context.There is a distinctly authoritarian directive ominously, if sardonically, commandeering us through Jonathan Monaghan's 3D film loop, The Pavilion. Of course the best artists always compel us to see worlds we aren't ready or don't want to see. But the imagery that Monaghan mashes together from the pixels of real photographed consumer products and high-end real estate is composed to purposely impose upon our minds the signage of imperious expectations and rarified tastes that we instantly read to be issued from ""above"". That we so easily recognize Monaghan's The Pavilion to be the abode of the oligarchical class despite their physical absence indicates the degree to which we have had to contend with oligarchy in our lives and have even grown accustomed to its ubiquitous presence. We of course read the luxurious interiors and perverse technological innovations and artifacts to be the playthings of the rich and powerful. It helps that Monaghan's 3D mise-en-scenes are so real in appearance as to represent the most tangible of elite tastes, firstly, in a haute-couture showroom of militaristic riot gear for the oligarch with stringent security and defense needs at home and at work, and secondly in a luxurious bed chamber and its encompassing closet designed for ... him? her? The oligarch's gender is not only withheld, it is irrelevant to our cultural present. All that matters is that the oligarchical class is represented through the signage of their possessions and lifestyles as a permanent if ominous American fixation of usurped power and the obscene imbalance of wealth acquired through the flattening of democracy.  Monaghan's cutting-edge visual and conceptual designs convey that he is as capacious in his vision, as meticulous in his craftsmanship, and as mythopoetically literate as either Mariko Mori or Matthew Barney. Monaghan leaves his mark on 3D with the evocative stillness he imposes on a medium commercially designed for generating the fast and furious mainstream animations of blockbuster cinema productions that reduce audience attention spans. Presenting a stark contrast to the knock offs of popular culture, Monaghan distinguishes himself from the 3D artists informed by popular animation, as well as from those who use 3D to extend the media of painting and sculpture . In The Pavilion, Monahan's slow conveyance of the viewer's gaze through expansive 3D spaces filled with streamlined objects and real brands reveals his visual literacy has been conditioned by advertising and cinema, two fields that share a decidedly intentional (as opposed to incidental or aesthetic) aim to their designs. In this regard the intention in The Pavilion manifests as a heightening of the ambience of largesse and cultural virility. With objects mimicking all the artifice of advertising -- the magic of immanent wish fulfillment; the fetishistic stimulation of eroticism; the invocation of power and status -- Monaghan's visualizations simulate the virtuoso technics of cinema: the motion capture of camera zooms, pans and ellipses; the compositional panoramas of the full depth of field; the montage of scenic juxtapositions. Monaghan further adds to the illusion of The Pavilion's realism by making his survey of rooms appear direct, candid and emphatic, even as he employs the ruses of advertising and the seductive tropes of cinema to construct a semiotic and existential comic-tableau satirizing the media's direct intersection with the imperatives of the oligarchical class. When we are conveyed first into and through the antiseptic showroom of The Pavilion, we take in the semiotics of a defensive power so real in its display of paramilitary riot gear, some of us may be baffled about whether to laugh or to shudder at the signage of the American militaristic imperative on display with all the design imperative and gentrified discretion of an Armani emporium or a Prada boutique. Exiting the showroom, Monaghan escorts us to an elaborately minimalist bed chamber outfitted with a status-affirming consumerism so pronounced it could easily be mistaken for a temple to compulsive consumption, a modern pharaoh's tomb outfitted with an array of closets concealing all the artifacts required of the afterlife. Naturally an iconography of class, especially that concerning a class which enshrouds itself in remoteness and privacy, is always predisposed to cliche and stereotype -- the invasion of the ideal at every step of interpretation. But Monaghan's sense of humor brings both cliche and stereotype as much into focus as subjects of his satirical pictorialism as he does the rich we largely imagine. In short, The Pavilion is more about our envy and fantasies of the rich and powerful than it is about them, and in this Monaghan draws a caricature that is no more a portrait than are conventional Hollywood movies.  If his mashups of the showroom and bed chamber convey Monaghan's understanding of the sociology of design in marketing, it is Monaghan's cinematographically-styled, yet entirely-simulated long shots, slow zooms and pans that steer our visual conveyance into and through the showroom, then out its doors to the open expanse of horizontality defining the immaculate bedchamber. Monaghan's videos comprised of simulated slow camera pans and zooms of imagined landscapes, interiors and objects are informed more by such signature sci-fi films as Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Andre Tarkovsky's Solaris and Ridley Scott's Alien and Prometheus, only transferred to earthly and decidedly corporate and global terrain. It's more than just the software simulating a real camera filming an elaborately futuristic soundstage set that commands our attention. It's the simulation of a camera simulating the human gaze that Monaghan evokes with the mastery of a cinematographer. And it's the mood that the music and audio discretely imparts. It is exactly this formal yet imaginary play on a camera's capture of still and luxurious spaces that recalls the faux Louis XVI bedchamber at the end of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Even more importantly, Monaghan recreates for audiences in 2015 the kind of disorienting experience that Kubrick introduced to unprepared audiences in 1969. The difference, of course, is that Kubrick photographed his speed-of-light parable on a soundstage furnished with props, whereas Monaghan, sans camera and film crew, has done no more than computationally cropped disparate photographic details of high-end furnishings and decorative objects that he then recomposes into ultra-glossy animation stills. It is such stills that Monaghan slowly enlarges onscreen to effect the illusion of a physical camera's approach through space. In short, Monaghan is making that film which the Motion Picture Industry has predicted since the invention of motion capture technology will be made without live actors and physical sets.As far as 3D goes, Monaghan's simulation is simple, yet it is the simplicity of the illusion that makes the effect all the more challenging to our preconceptions of reality and ideality. If we have learned anything from the history of art, it is that it takes very little formal alteration to a picture or an object to transform it from a model of reality into a representation of ideality, and vice versa. It is this simplest of visual magics which make all the debates over what is real and what is ideal -- as argued by philosophers since the Greek PreSocratics and the Indus Vedic scribes, and over the centuries reconfigured the debates of epistemologists and phenomenologists, existentialists and ontologists, structuralists and culturalists -- all over what is the distinction between and the linkage mediating the real and the ideal, when they in fact may very well be the same.  The real vs. ideal debate is neutralized more by 3D than any other medium, including photography, though it is with his mashups of photographs that Monaghan's renderings reconcile the debate of the real vs. the ideal at least artistically. But so far I have only accounted for Monaghan's simulation of the real, which is in fact it's opposite, the ideal. To account for the real real, we must also look to its opposite in the ideal, or what in The Pavilion appears as the surreal. For it is in the working out of the creative process of the mind as a surreality (or ideality) that we in fact manifest the reality that is always a construct of consciousness.The transformation from the appearance of the real to the realization of the ideal is so slow that it takes a moment for the viewer to register that at the center of the bed chamber ceiling is the musculature of a tightly-closed sphincter. The real has suddenly become the surreal as the sphincter opens to reveal the sky. Then, as the orifice widens, through it descends a biomechatronic egg designed after that supremely imperial object'dart, the Fabergé Egg, only now upholstered in black-leather and outfitted with a pair of human testicles on its anterior (because the oligarch no doubt believes it takes balls to be a raider and pillager of the little people's savings and property.) It is one of Monaghan's series of eggs referencing the architecture, corporations, genetic and biomechatronic experiments of the past and present, all crafted with the interests of today's global oligarchy in mind.  At this point, the video engaged with the surrounding gallery exhibition comprised of an edition of computational collage prints rendering variations on Fabergé Eggs, each similarly technologically, decoratively and architecturally enhanced. Monaghan's Eggs have all the right consumer touches to make the work both compelling as uncanny design and social satire, though he may have gotten a bit too derivative of Matthew Barney in his recourse to the biomechatronic motif better known as the cyborg. But as one of the truly contemporary creations of the last century, the cyborg is likely to long be a mine of the uncanny, with the choice of what human anatomy is grafted onto what object and technology yields the desired results. Making his cyborgs not living beings but human-fabricated techno-consumer objects with miniature architectural structures, even a Starbucks store, is Monaghan's genius stroke. The cyborg that appears at the center of the bed chamber's ceiling as a sphincter opening as a skylight is the surreal ideality that propels us through to the end of the video, the whole point seemingly postulating that all reality must finally submit to an ideality of mind, whether human or godly. Even if it is no more than the product of a god's anal emission, it is a fitting end to the paleolithic origin of the artist as emulation of the god creating a world the the world's creation myths convey. What causes these virtual objects to hold a strange and ominous power over the gaping viewer is their glimmering realism, the kind we see reproduced in high-gloss magazines. Monaghan's still photo-collages are our era's version of the 17th-century Dutch and Flemish vanitas and pronk still-lifes, replete with their moralizing ironies reflecting the transience and superficiality of such worldly and sumptuous veneers as vain and intemperate illusions. We can see in them, as consumerist microcosms, the hyperbolic expectations that begin by sheltering us from the ravages of time and space but which ultimately must yield to them. But rather than getting stringent about consumerism, Monaghan is a true late capitalist in poking fun at the moralism of anti-capitalist ideology.  With the Freudian fetish arguably devalued in a Western society that no longer has its erotic desires restrained by severe moral codes, the current generation of artists conflate the body with the inanimate object not as some clandestine repository of sexual desire (say in finding arousal in the folds of a hat that double for the vulva), but as a formalist-inspired empathy with objects for their aesthetic appearance, functionalist extension of the body, and social denotations of status and wealth. This denotation can be either or both consumerist and aesthetic. Of course the cyborg was born with science fiction -- chiefly such visually futuristic media as comic books and cinema that the new conflation became identified as the cyborg. By the 1980s the cyborg became a paradigm of radical transformation of identity politics with the feminist film theory of Donna Haraway's elaboration of the cyborg as a motif of empowerment for women, a signage and narrative structure that confers a superhuman ability available to women for transcending the imposed cultural and social limitations absent in the realistic mainstream media representations.  But the cyborg principle at work in Monghan's videos and photo animations emphatically reinforce the theory that art making is ultimately an expression of our unconscious desire to rejoin with the material world, the forces that have created it, or, more pragmatically, to join the real with the ideal. For the material to most of us is what is shared and thereby composes and defines the real. Conversely, the ideal is what we only resentfully admit to being private however much we will it to be the way of the world. It is a duality that perhaps motivates the artist more deeply than aesthetics or ideology. It is because the ideal cannot be made real in any collective sense that it is channeled into art, that nexus which culture vents publicly as if to placate the urge to make the ideal real in some larger revolutionary sense.  Returning to The Pavilion's affinity with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, we can consider Monaghan's descending cyborg egg in the oligarch's bed chamber to be the uncanny equivalent of the appearance of the space pod in Kubrick's bed chamber at the end of time (what Einstein held to be arrival at the speed of light). Except that, in its day the bed chamber scene shattered the filmgoer's faith in the illusion of realism and the linear narration of cinema. Of course art audiences today are better equipped to receive the comic surreality of Monaghan's descending giant cyborg egg as the reality of simulation announcing itself. But we still consciously receive the simulation of the descending cyborg egg as if it were an elaborate prop descending in real space before a movie camera situated on a soundstage, when we are really only seeing an algorithmic calibration for scanning and enlarging a photo-computated collage as an animated illusion. Of course how much and if the audience is fooled by such a simulated subterfuge depends on its literacy in 3D platforms and tools. The 3D-informed audience however receives the reality of the simulation. The point is that it is only after Monaghan steps up the surrealistic stylization of his video that he abandons the physics and visualizations of realism and introduces the idealities and surrealities that are the real reality at hand.  All in all, The Pavilion is Monaghan's discreet declaration that at the center of all reality is our projective ideality, and that it is this ideality that 3D excels at rendering as a reality unlike any medium before it. In his convincing 3D-materializations, Monaghan's art counts among our generation's most photorealistic illusional models of 3D art in that it passes for both a photographic and cinematographic record of real objects, spaces and gradations of light. While the revelation of the ideality simulated as reality is entertaining in the first few viewings, a more complex dialectic comes into play once the fuller phenomenological implications -- that is once an awareness of the structural features of consciousness at play throughout The Pavilion -- make themselves known. And with this phenomenological scrutiny come various proposals of a linkage, or a continuum, or a competition, between the reality of the world with the ideality of the mind busily at work mediating that reality. In the second video loop of the exhibition, the twenty-minute Escape Pod, 2015, Monaghan returns to his former animated reveries -- what can be called the mythopoetic ideality -- that is the making of new myths for our times out of the motifs and narrations of old, even ancient mythologies. Unlike The Pavilion, Escape Pod is informed almost entirely by the legacy of traditional animation and surrealist painting even as it brings a certain luster and contemplation that is foreign to most animation. It is also informed by ancient mythologies of the hunt, specifically those of Norse and Greek variety centering on the plight of the Stag and its symbolic references to the life stages of birth, maturity and death. To add to the complexity, Monaghan transposes the Stag to modernist spaces largely rendered with conventional animation software, though here too there is a photographic departure especially noticeable in the forest and water settings.  Yet for all its mythopoetic ingenuity, Escape Pod is altogether more traditional in its narrational structure and visualization and less reflexive in its imagery's relationship of the structures of our experience of the world, consciousness of mind, and the modeling of reality and ideality simultaneously in terms of pictorial narration. A mountain landscapes evocative of Salvador Dali conveys that the imagery of dream is being conflated without the iconography of traditional myth in the engaging and beautiful figure of the golden Stag. While the mountain motifs and other landscape imagery recall the sensory-motor coordination of traditional painting, the animals that embody Innocence in Escape Pod come into being with the animation modeling designed for cartoons, however much they are rendered here with heightened technical finesse, greater dimensionality and a more dreamlike arbitrariness and futility of purpose. But what distances Monaghan's cartoons most from the renderings of commercial productions is their sense of bewilderment and loss of meaningful direction in their imperative of escaping -- What? -- an unseen yet ominous fate that traditionally was the hunter, sometimes a god, but here seems to be an existential if unseen entity representing ubiquitous, dangerous and deadly pursuit, capture and containment.  Escape Pod is at its best a conflation of archetypes and analogies concerning innocence and its loss amid a commercial and autocratic superstructure. But its mytholopoetic treatment makes the appearance of the animal cyborgs less incongruent, since there is no rendering of reality to be incongruent to. Instead of a theoretical contemplation to ponder, we relax in an sardonic entertainment, sometimes filled with the pathos of the innocent, yet breaking into a comic surreality with the descent of a hovering giant architectural spacecraft, again equipped with anterior testicles, and foretelling the oligarchical race of the future. To his credit, Monaghan is an impeccable formalist and compelling steward of the audience through a uniquely tangible succession of spaces, each real and captivating enough to impel debate as to how much the artist's control over what we see is autocratic to the point of reducing the viewer to a passive observer, as opposed to an active participant. But this is his point. Whether or not he has in mind Guy de Bord's theory of the consumer society spellbound into political inaction and subservience by the spectacles of capitalism (see my Matthew Weinstein feature), Monaghan is circumnavigating us through an array of the late capitalist, corporately-branded spectacles keeping us riveted to them at the same time that we discern their allure is a mirage of mythological thinking distracting us from real action.  Earlier videos by Monaghan which pay a more direct homage to the cartoon legacy of animation make our political distraction by entertainment abundantly clear. But the superrealism of the new work confuses such cautionary prompts in being so very seductive in their technical proficiency. I personally prefer this ambiguity, as it is the one lapse in the Monaghan vision that allows us some resistance to the artist's commanding moral and political steerage of our experience of his art. For even when we agree with an artist's point of view, the impulse for individuality compels us to search out some flaw or lapse that facilitates our departure. .Perhaps the greatest human flaw is our proclivity to be seduced by the delusion of reality. It imagines that we can know the world without any interference from our own personal and social experience. As if we can see without the structure of our own eyes and brains mediating, interfering. Reality is the delusion that we can see the world as it is, rather than the world as we make it appear. It is why I don't use the term virtual reality to refer to or describe 3D animations. For all reality is virtual, while 3D as a category makes obvious what the human mind dimensionally shares with the reality that is so elusive to the mind. Read other posts by G.

President Bachelet has asked on Wednesday, May 6, 2015, for all her Cabinet ministers to submit their resignations. (AP Photo/Moises Castillo, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14dba2400006800382c5d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A shocking new ad campaign in Chile is telling women if they want to have an abortion, they should consider falling from the top of a staircase. That's because right now in Chile, it's illegal to end a pregnancy regardless of the circumstances. So even if the fetus won't survive outside the uterus, conception occurred as the result of rape or even if the mother's own life is in danger from carrying the baby, the law says a woman must keep the baby unless she miscarries naturally. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet wants to overturn the law, but has her work cut out for her as she takes on a conservative and Roman Catholic-based legislature.Here in America, I'm happy, yet amazed Roe vs. Wade hasn't been overturned. It's proof that there are so many people who believe in a woman's right to choose, but are only brave enough to admit it when it's law. I don't blame people for being afraid, because taking any social position in America that goes against the religious right can cost you your job, friends and even family. The delusional thinking is that a fetus is a human being. A fetus is only a fetus and it cannot survive without its mother's body, which makes critical thinking on abortion simple: we own our bodies, and neither the government nor the church has any jurisdiction or say in what we do with it. Once it's breathing independently outside the mother's womb it has rights, but until a fetus becomes a human being it is part of its mother's body. The problem with people who argue against this is they are thinking through emotion instead of logic. Abortion is a sad but sometimes necessary event; the mother should be free to choose what happens inside her own body. The fact is that the advent of contraception and legalized abortion has done more to liberate women than any two events in history, and the all-boys club of ""women should be kept barefoot and pregnant"" is none too pleased. Women have been controlled, bullied and abused by men since the beginning of time, and maintaining control of their reproductive rights is one of the methods men have used to keep them from rising up in the world. As long as a woman had to be home raising kids, she couldn't go out in the world and stake her own claim or make her own money. Men not only had a physical strength advantage over women, but they enjoyed absolute monetary power as well. It's hard to have equal rights with empty pockets, and unplanned pregnancy was the catalyst of inequality. Birth control and abortion changed all that, and in the past 40 years we have witnessed the greatest emancipation of women in American history. Women now have the power to forge their own destiny, earn unlimited amounts of money and challenge men for political power. This evolution would never have taken place in America without legalized abortion. Overturning Roe vs. Wade has never been about saving babies. It's about controlling women and the religious extremists will continue masking this hidden agenda until they are exposed. Fortunately, millions of strong independent women refused to be subjected to the tyranny of ancient religious dogma and puritanical societal norms and are boldly creating their own futures. As women continue to gain more political power, social status and financial equality, they will make America a stronger, more prosperous country. Most Latin American countries severely limit access to abortion. A total ban is in place in seven of them: El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Honduras, Haiti, Suriname and Chile. Hopefully, in time, Chile will see the law on abortion overturned. I'm hopeful it will as it recently passed a series of education reforms aimed at more inclusion for Chilean students, as well as a bill approving civil unions for unmarried partners, which included same-sex couples.In 2015, it's amazing that we're still seeing many women around the world treated as second-class citizens. When will people wake up and stop giving into ancient dogma and allow women the same rights and freedoms as men?President Bachelet should be commended for her fight to bring gender equality and women's access to reproductive health services to the country. Let's hope she wins the battle and sets the example for all countries that still outlaw abortion and a woman's right to choose."

The ""Nine City"" legend has its roots in Thornton Wilder's classic novel, Theophilus North, which was first published in 1973. Lace up your best sneakers. You're going to be padding around nine parallel worlds that are layered within this coastal town of only about 26,000 people. There's the ""First City"" of early Colonial landmarks, the world-renowned ""Third City"" of yachts and wharfs and docks and cargo-loads more. My wife and I, both Rhode Islanders, drive down to Newport in every season and as often as we can. Even in flurries or fog, the clang of ropes on masts and the squeal of seagulls make us feel like we are in a nautical yarn that is about to be told. Here is our top pick for each of Newport's ""Cities"": things to see, eat and do so you can enter the story, too.Newport's First City, according to Wilder, is what you can find of the town's earliest life. Historic homes show off cornices and clapboard built by English settlers (Newport was founded in 1639). But more dramatic than these is a simple cylinder of stone. Known as ""the Viking Tower"" or Old Stone Mill, this twenty-four-foot fieldstone pile in Touro Park is a persistent mystery. Some say it was constructed by Vikings who had landed here 1,000 years ago. Others date it to around 1660 and credit Governor Benedict Arnold, great-grandfather of the famous traitor. See it for yourself to decide. The Second City is Newport's ""eighteenth-century town"" which has a lot to pick from. The must-see here is Touro Synagogue: the oldest in the country, dating to 1763. Touro's clean, tropical-island lines are an architectural draw, and it's famous as a symbol of American religious freedom. About a year before the Bill of Rights was passed, President George Washington sent a letter to the worried congregation promising that the new government would ""give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.""Experiencing Newport's Third City -- which is all about yachts and regattas -- means getting out on the water, preferably by sail. One of my favorite tour boats is Adirondack II, a traditionally-rigged 60-passenger schooner built, not of fiberglass, but of fir, teak and mahogany. Daily sailings on the Adirondack II breeze you across Narragansett Bay, past a cluster of historic lighthouses and close to Hammersmith Farm (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's childhood home). Sign up for seaspray, a whiff of fresh varnish and -- almost forgot -- glasses of champagne onboard are only $1.00 a pop.Newport's Fourth City is its military side. With the Naval War College here, that service branch gets all the local press. But for its history and views, check out Fort Adams, the nation's largest coastal fortification which was pressed into service during the Civil War, Spanish-American War and World Wars I and II. A peacetime mecca for crowds snapping photos of flotillas of tall ships (usually June and July), it's home to the world-class Newport Jazz Festival come August.Often showy, always preppy, Newport seems like the last place for a Greenwich Village-style colony of artists. But this, in a nutshell, is its Fifth City. Henry James's family lived here as did Julia Ward Howe, author of 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic.' To slip into this world, attend a chamber music concert at the Newport Music Festival which is celebrating its 47th season this summer. The Festival showcases internationally-known musicians every July, filling the grand salons of the Gilded Age summer ""cottages"" with arpeggios and grace notes, not to mention eager listeners.   Newport's Sixth City is the one you think you already know. The Bellevue Avenue lineup of famous mansions and the peacock displays of resident Vanderbilts, Astors and others. But add a touch of mystery to your mansion visits by including Clarendon Court, which grew infamous in the 1980s when owner Martha ""Sunny"" von Bulow was found stretched out on the bathroom floor having slipped into an irreversible coma. Her husband, Claus von Bulow, was tried, convicted (and then in a second trial, acquitted) of trying to bump her off with an overdose of insulin. The case was featured in the 1990 movie, ""Reversal of Fortune,"" and is still much argued about.   Servants to the rich make up the Seventh City: those who, in Wilder's words, ""never enter the front door of the house in which they live except to wash it."" Other than taking a job polishing Bentleys, the best way to see it is to stroll on the Cliff Walk, a National Recreation Trail that traces the coast with mansion lawns for scenery on its other side. A mile south of Memorial Boulevard you'll find ""the Forty Steps"" which lead you down to a platform just above the sea. During Newport's heyday these steps hosted a crowd: butlers and footmen came to smoke and shoot the breeze on breaks -- all out of view of their employers. Newport's Eighth City is made up of gate-crashers, fortune-hunters and ""prying journalists"" (that's me). You'll bump into all of the above at Bannister's Wharf -- a cluster of upscale shops along the city's refurbished waterfront. Here Newport wannabes strut around in brand new Topsiders and Bermuda-bright khaki shorts. My wife and I like scanning the scene from the windows of Clarke Cooke House Restaurant which, in its ""Candy Store"" bistro, serves traditional seafood with a twist. Try for a table on the second floor for a seagull's-eye view.   ""Finally,"" writes Wilder, ""there...is, and long will be [Newport's] Ninth City, the American middle-class town...with little attention to spare for the eight cities so close to it."" Tasting it means no big hotels, no bus tours. Find a small inn within walking distance of where locals eat and shop. Victorian but with a refreshingly light décor, the Almondy Bed and Breakfast Inn is a restored 1890s house that's tucked away on Pelham Street but close to the center of town. Prices are mid-range but depend on the room you reserve (and there are only five). On every side of the Almondy are normal houses, normal people. Newporters like Theophilus North.

(AP Photo/Gildas Ngingo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14dcc240000320022a039.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Burundi. October 2000.I'm wrapping up a report for Le Monde. I saw burned coffee fields. Ransacked villages of which not a single tile or scrap of sheet metal or cinderblock remained, villages where everything, absolutely everything, was scraped down to the bone. I encountered units of the Intagoheka (""the ones who never sleep""), the Hutu militia responsible for horrifying acts of violence: kidnappings; bodies, decapitated and impaled, drying in the sun by the side of the road; kids locked in their classroom moments before their own teacher torches it. I heard and reported accounts that the other side, the Tutsi side, was not always outdone: Weren't people saying that certain elements of the army had just declared civilians in the Kavumu hills, supposedly fiefs of Hutu Power, to be ""legitimate military targets""? In short, I reported on a genocide suspended -- but suspended only after causing 300,000 deaths. And on the eve of my departure, remembering that in neighboring Rwanda radio had been used to give the signal to accelerate the massacres, I had the idea, with two young Burundian intellectuals, David Gakunzi and Innocent Muhozi, of using radio in another way, of starting a political radio station whose purpose would be to oppose political views of the country's situation interpreted through the terrible prism of ethnicity. We called it Radio Renaissance. The André Lévy Foundation in Paris brought it into existence.And for 15 years it aired programs supporting the vital development of a civil society, a society capable of leaving behind the tragic language of race war that had held sway since the Belgian colonial period. * * *May 2015. The country seemed at peace. The forces of dialogue seemed to have won out over the preachers of hate. Seven years before I had gone back to Bujumbura when Innocent Muhozi, who headed Radio Renaissance, invited me down to help him celebrate its expansion into television. The Burundi that I encountered at that time was wounded but still standing, ravaged but rebuilding, traumatized by the terrible decade that had begun in 1993 with the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye but apparently freed of the curse of genocide. And then, suddenly, catastrophe. President Nkurunziza, having come to the end of his second term, does not wish to leave office. Peaceful demonstrations in the streets of Bujumbura are organized to encourage him to respect a hard-won constitution for which uncounted victims paid with their lives. The president orders police to fire into the crowd. The outgoing president's security forces enter Bumerec Hospital and kill wounded soldiers in their beds. His militia uses grenades on tomato vendors alleged to have supported a group of republican officers who, it must be said, have been wrongly described as plotting a coup when in fact they rose to the defense of the popular movement favoring the rule of law. The leader of an opposition party, Zedi Feruzi, is gunned down in front of his home and then finished off with a bullet to the head. And, during the night of May 13-14 a group of Imbonerakure militia men take up positions in front of our broadcasting station, spray it with gunfire, sack its equipment, and silence one of the freest voices of the country. * * *Each of us has his own omens of impending disaster. For me, the omen was what happened at the station. Not that the fate of its technicians (they are safe and sound) can be compared to that of the three tomato sellers who were summarily assassinated. And I am relieved to report that my friend Innocent Muhozi emerged free from a lengthy hearing that, fortunately, was attended by representatives of the French and Belgian embassies. But that the regime has taken the risk of going after a broadcaster established and supported by a French nongovernmental organization says a great deal about its recklessness -- a worrisome sign indeed. That one of the few media outlets to advocate staunchly against the ethnicization of public debate and in favor of the building of a democratic public space is a clear example of what Walter Benjamin would call a fire alarm. And I would add that former President Nkurunziza's constitutional coup -- in this case the label is accurate -- is one that has, as most coups do (or perhaps a little more than most) made the news its primary platform and objective. The key figures in the reassertion of control have been Jérome Nzokirantevye (head of the national broadcasting network), Willy Nyamitwe (a Hutu Power zealot and all powerful communication adviser), and Edouard Nduwimania (the interior minister, who has been broadcasting an unrelenting stream of murderous messages from Ngozi).People will say what they will. But the triumph of the hate media chills the blood. For anyone who remembers the killing fields of Kigali and Butare, it sounds a new and intolerable knell. And that is why, while awaiting the involvement of the international community that was so tragically absent 20 years ago from Rwanda, I intend to do everything in my power to see that Radio Renaissance returns to the air and resumes its fight for the rule of law.

But let's take a look at some other words that have been of crucial importance to both Americans and mankind in general to see how these four stand up. In his first inaugural address, March 4, 1933, Roosevelt said, ""So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself--nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."" Kennedy famously supported the West Germans when he said, ""Ich bin ein Berliner."" His grammar was wrong (the correct German is ""Ich bin Berliner""), but let sleeping dogs die. Critics of the health care plan might call upon Polonius' famous advice to Laertes, ""Neither a borrower nor a lender be."" After losing the California gubernatorial race in l962 Nixon said, ""You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference."" ""Where's the Beef?"" is what an infamous Wendy's commercial asked. John Donne said, ""No man is an island, entire of itself."" Speaking of fast food the Digital Underground were responsible for these iconic lyrics from ""The Humpty Dance."" ""I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom."" Goethe said, ""the eternal-feminine lures to perfection,"" Camus, ""Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday; I can't be sure."" And then there was Santayana's famous, ""those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" However, in his address before the Democratic Convention in l936, Roosevelt also said, ""this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny."" With all the great locutions made in the service of progress, redress and regress, could the rather lame ""established by the state"" really usurp America's destiny? Oh and there's one last quote which is always applicable in matters of jurisprudence, ""while the cat's away, the mice will play.""photo: Peter Souza{This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"

We're all familiar with both good and bad customer experiences, and we go through one or the other on a near daily basis. A rude flight attendant, a printer that jams, internet that goes down, and a package that gets delivered damaged, all shape our experiences with the respective companies we interact with. Of course, no company is perfect, which is why what an organization does during both good and bad experiences makes a huge difference.However, over the past few years we have started to see the emergence of the employee experience, which is now something that many HR leaders and executives around the world are focusing on. Similar to the customer experience, the employee experience is what happens when an employee interacts with your organization. It starts with how they first find and apply for a job at your company, and ends with how they leave and includes everything in between. For example, at T-Mobile they have started to provide insight into the jobs that people are applying for including how long they have been available and how many applicants they have received. They also re-wrote many of their job descriptions in plain English instead of the legalese and marketing speak we are all so used to. Why did they do this? To improve the experience of potential employees before they even get in the door.Decades ago nobody cared about the employee experience because all of the power was in the hands of employers. They simply needed to list a job and give people a place to do that job, nothing else really mattered. There was no focus on engagement, inspiration, empowerment, designing beautiful workplaces, using modern technology, or the like. All of these things have just recently become mainstream topics of discussion. In fact the Society for Human Resource Management found that the top priority for those in HR is talent management. Why? Because the power has now shifted into the hands of employees. Organizations have always assumed that they can create a place where they assumed people NEEDED to work there and are now realizing that they must create a place where people WANT to work there. The war for talent has never been more fierce. People are turning to non-traditional ways of earning a living such as creating products on Etsy, renting out their homes on Airbnb, driving for Uber or Lyft, become freelancers on sites like Upwork (formerly Elance-Odesk), and the like. Technology platforms such as LinkedIn have also made it incredibly easy for head hunters to steal talent from their competitors. So in this type of a world what can organizations do to help make sure that employees want to show up? You guessed it, focus on the employee experience.Catered meals, onsite dry cleaning, beautiful office spaces, modern technology, and flexible work programs may all seem like fancy perks but all of the companies I have been speaking with leverage these things as strategic business initiatives. They offer these things because employees actually ask for them. Employees at different companies value and care about different things. This is why organizations such as F5 Networks, which sees employees working 9-5 in cubicles (yet is ranked as one of the best places to work in America), is so different than an organization like Google that offers pretty much anything you can want and think of.Everything from the food employees eat to the technologies they use to get their jobs done to the office spaces they work in are all a part of the employee experience. Every organization I speak to thinks about the employee experience a bit differently. In other words, there is no cookie cutter approach that every company can take and apply. Not everything that Google does will work for your company and not everything you are doing at your company will work at Google, nor should it!Jacob Morgan is a futurist, best-selling author and keynote speaker, learn more by visiting The Future Organization.com or check out his latest book,""The Future of Work: Attract New Talent, Build Better Leaders and Create a Competitive Organization,"" on Amazon."

Federico was commenting on the controversy that exploded during the Expo 2015 in Milan, Italy, whose theme is ""Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life."" Countries, institutions, organizations and businesses from all over the world have built pavilions that showcase - or are supposed to - what's happening in terms of food, sustainability, and innovation at the global level. (Disclaimer: I have been an adviser for the U.S. pavilion).It all started on May 19 when, on the occasion of the grand opening of the Slow Food pavilion, Carlo Petrini, its founder and president, critiqued the organization for the presence of participants as different as Slow Food and McDonald's. ""In front of those who sell meat in a bun for 1.20 euro, how do you explain the value and the prices of those who raise and produce according to certain criteria?"" he was reported saying during his address. Slow Food's goal, as stated on its website, is to ""ensure everyone has access to good, clean and fair food,"" while preventing the disappearance of traditional food cultures and traditions.According to the Italian newspaper La Stampa, McDonald's retort came quick through a press release: ""We wonder why those who proclaim the importance of biodiversity do not agree on the idea of diversity of supply, and especially do not demonstrate respect for people's freedom and ability to choose... We are pleased and proud to serve 6,000 affordable meals of good quality at the Expo, with ingredients that come from Italian farmers... Thousands of people chose us freely, maybe after passing to visit the immense, sad and little known Slow Food pavilion.""The terms of the controversy are complex: McDonald's refers to the consumers' individual choices as an expression of freedom and autonomy - an argument that the company has used when accused of contributing to health problems among its customers. Moreover, in this specific case, it presents itself as new and fun against the supposedly stuffy and elitist approach embraced by Slow Food. The rhetorical move to equate biodiversity to diversity of supply is daring but effective.Moreover, McDonald's touting of the affordability of its offer resonates powerfully in Italy, where many are reeling under the hardships imposed by a long and apparently unbeatable economic crisis and may not be particularly amenable to reflecting on complex food system issues.As a matter of fact, the company's labor policy in Italy is quite different from the one adopted in the U.S., where the company is involved in labor issues regarding wages and benefits. As spelled out in its Italian FAQ page, ""All McDonald's employees are regularly employed under the national collective contract for the tourism sectors, 94% of them with indefinite contracts. To be precise, 71% are employed under indefinite contracts and 23% on training contracts (with a duration of 36 months), assimilated by law to the indefinite ones. For the remaining 6%, fixed-term contracts are used. In almost all cases, upon expiration the contracts of apprenticeship become indefinite contracts."" In Italy, an indefinite contract is not something to take lightly right now.The question of the local procurement of ingredients, which McDonald's emphasizes in its Italian operations, had already become a matter of disagreement between the company and Slow Food in 2010, when the then-Minister of Agriculture Luca Zaia approved of the launch of McItaly sandwiches that featured Italian mainstays such as artichokes and asiago cheese and - so the minister claimed - would support Italian rural production. On that occasion, Carlo Petrini observed that McDonald's had not dealt with the issue of fair payment for food producers, which he argued should be as important to the company as the origin of the ingredients it buys.The discussion is destined to continue. After all, Slow Food developed in part as a response to the opening of McDonald's outlets in Italy in the late 1980s. And the flexibility that the fast food company has demonstrated in expanding its business in Italy - as well as the efficacy of its communication strategies - indicates the importance it attributes to its presence and success in the Mediterranean country, especially at a time when its sales are suffering at home."

""I had a career and I had faith,"" hinting that the two are not mutually exclusive. ""Optimism is part of doing well in business,"" he noted. ""The cynics don't prevail."" If we think about life as the pursuit of wisdom, Lynch, shared many nuggets that taught students how to live a more meaningful and happy life.He stressed the importance of kindness in business. ""Being nasty and cynical does not work,"" he said. When you disagree with someone, avoid pounding them. ""Any fool can criticize, complain, and condemn,"" Dale Carnegie, American self-help writer, advised in his 1936 classic How To Win Friends And Influence People. ""But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving."" Lynch repeated that mantra. ""There should be a neutral response to good and bad news.""Lynch talked about gratitude, which translates into appreciating more what we have already achieved. He stressed the value of forgiveness; don't only remember your grudges.""Don't make life about having a big scorecard,"" Lynch insisted, explaining that envy is the worst of the seven deadly sins. If you keep a scorecard and constantly compare yourself to others, you will not have a fulfilling life. You can't make your happiness dependent on how others score.Persistence is a virtue, he cautioned, but stubbornness is a vice. The probability of success determines the difference. Look at the facts and ask yourself whether it makes sense to put in more work. Ask yourself on a regular basis if what you pursue remains a good story.""There are a lot of people that are gospel experts, but are they living their advice?"" Lynch asked students. It's not enough to know. You need to put your knowledge into practice.When he was asked about investment advice, Lynch said the decision of doing nothing is underestimated. ""There should be a business case on doing nothing,"" he suggested. In a world where people buy and sell daily, Lynch's advice of patience is important to bear in mind. As trader Jesse Livermore said, men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon.Lynch said that often when you think that you are late to the game, the game is only in its second inning. To illustrate his point, he talked about Wal-Mart. Even if you bought Wal-Mart ten years after it went public in 1970, you still would have made 30 times your money. Wal-Mart was only in 15 percent of America. Saturation hadn't been reached yet.Above all, you need to help those that are disadvantaged. Lynch enjoys reading biographies of incredible achievers that have made it against the odds. Often those kind of people give back the most. If you don't do something in your life to help the disadvantaged, he said, you have failed. As Mahatma Gandhi said the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.This was originally published at The Harbus, the student newspaper of the Harvard Business School."

His name was Roger, because that was the name one of my other little boys, who loved Roger Rabbit, gave to him. He died before he was born, and I gave birth to him knowing that he was already gone. My partner and I held him in our arms and said goodbye for a while, and then they took him away and we didn't see him again. We hadn't planned that pregnancy; we were hopped up on hormones and new love and an overly-optimistic belief in the diaphragm-plus-rhythm method. My partner was pretty young, just at the start of his career, and we hadn't been together long, so it was very scary for him. Still, we welcomed and loved our baby and got very, very excited about adding our own child to the little family we had with my boys. Everything seemed fine. Then I got a terrible ""flu"" that I couldn't shake. My temperature was raging and I knew it was worse than a flu should be. I went to my general practitioner, but she dismissed me angrily, saying I ought to know what the flu was. She told me to take paracetamol and said my baby and I would be fine. The flu-like symptoms cleared up and I went and had a routine blood test. The hospital called me up on a particularly happy and hopeful trip in the country with my partner and the kids and asked me to come in for a scan. I had no fears at that stage, but when I got to the hospital, the doctor looked at the monitor and told me, very kindly and gently, that our baby had died in the womb, that they would try to find out why, but often, it ""just happens,"" that they would give me a pill to induce me and then, because I was already at five months and he was big, I would give birth to him in a couple of days. I've always tried to be in control, especially in public places, but I howled and cried uncontrollably for a while. Then, my partner and I tried to get on with things. We told the boys, who had been so thrilled about the baby, and comforted them. We did the house painting we'd planned just for something to do. We watched endless episodes of ""Spaced"" to try to laugh and snap out of it. We did what we could. I passed the ensuing days in a tuned-out state and went to the hospital feeling numb. My boys had been born by caesarean, so it was my first natural delivery. Because there was no need to protect the baby, they gave me morphine when the pain became great. It meant that when I was holding him, I was half-drugged and dreamy. But I still remember. The hospital staff at UCH, who could not have been kinder to us, encouraged us to take pictures with our baby, as apparently, it would help. I have to say that later -- strange as it may seem and as tragic as those pictures were -- it did.Then began a strange time of waiting for results. It mattered in case it was something that would affect another pregnancy. They found nothing. I had to wait for my results in the baby wing, looking at pictures of happy babies, until the nurses found me crying and hustled me somewhere else. They thought I might like to see him again, and I had a desperate desire to do so, but then they came back and said that he had changed and it wouldn't be a good idea. They gave me tiny doll's clothes for his funeral and they arranged it for me. I went home feeling completely lost.I then threw myself into planning his funeral. It seemed so silly in some ways, but it meant a huge amount to me. I invited my best, most beloved friends. I planned the music carefully. I still can't hear the Barber Adagio without feeling weepy. Somehow I wanted the funeral to take the pace of the christening that should have been, to commemorate Roger. He was cremated and after some time I collected his ashes, alone in my car, and brought him home.We planted a cherry tree in the house we had in the country. I poured out his ashes in the roots. I wanted the tree to grow and to blossom every year. The tree would be a living manifestation of Roger. Over the next weeks, that tree became such a comfort to me. I tried to get on with normal life, but I'd find myself at a party in London and just be seized with the need to get away, to get to Roger's tree, to water it and make sure it was thriving. UCH had a church service for all those parents who had lost babies in the womb, like Roger, or who suffered a miscarriage. People read poems. I cried a lot. It helped. Then, after a few weeks, I got worse. I stopped coping. I'd been trying to get back to being fun, jolly, to make myself attractive to my partner, to drive us all past it. It stopped working. First, I was assailed by fears: that my partner would leave me; that the baby had been the glue that stuck us together; that Roger's death was, in a thousand ways, all my fault; that I was a failure and unlovable. I could see that though we had been close before, my partner was drawing away into his own ways of coping with his friends, which didn't involve me. And, then, even worse, I was continually and unexpectedly hit by waves of pain, thinking, feeling, shouting inside my head, ""where's my baby?"" I had thought my divorce a few years prior had been painful, but I would cheerfully relive that pain a thousand times again to have my baby back. I had horrors. I had dark dreams. I had never experienced anything like it. I swung between managing to fool myself that I was all better and the plunging into the blackest, weeping despair. My relationship did indeed break up, in the way of all self-fulfilling prophecies. The doctor gave me Prozac and it made me swell up like the Elephant Man and end up in A&E on a drip. I drank a bottle of tequila, despaired and called a help line. I called the Samaritans. They were amazing. But the darkness didn't go. I became very worried about myself. I was very, very alone with my little boys, trying to pretend for them that it was all OK in the day, then falling apart after every bedtime. I was lucky. My sons were due for a summer holiday with their father and my mother took a couple of weeks with them too. I got myself a backpack and went off on a low-budget, grassroots group tour of Indochina. The first night I broke down crying in a Bangkok bar listening to Eric Clapton's ""Tears from Heaven,"" about the loss of his son. A nice chap in the group said, OK, spend this evening telling me all about it, then try to put it all away for the rest of this trip. I did that. It got better. I was then consumed with moving, traveling, seeing things and being with people. I fell into a highly unsuitable passing relationship with a funny surfer guy; swam for my life against a riptide and then nearly drowned in a diving accident; got pneumonia and spent days on a drip in a hospital in Phuket. It was all kind of crazy, in so many ways, but it was living again, and focused me on how much I wanted to survive. When I got home, my partner was waiting for me. My boys were well and happy to see me. We were among the most fortunate. We had another baby, a beautiful daughter so incandescent in her wild and creative way that I can't believe I produced such a magical creature. Life went on and became, after a few more minor bumps, very happy indeed. When we sold the house in the country, we dug up the tree and its roots and the earth around it and brought it to where we lived in London. We planted the tree in the garden and for a few years, I prayed for Roger there every year on his birthday. The children know it's his tree. But the sad, or perhaps the happy, healthy thing, is that now we forget. We forget his birthday. We forget that we lost him. Day to day, he's left us, and our focus is with the living. While sometimes I feel guilty about that, I think it's perhaps a sign that we are designed to heal, to forget, and get over even the worst pain. I know there are people who suffer much more than I have done, who lose children they have known and loved. I cannot imagine that pain. But I have felt a pain that I thought I couldn't survive and in my own -- perhaps rather odd -- way, found a way to do it. Only after I felt able to talk to other women about my experience did I learn that sudden antenatal death syndrome is common. Since experiencing it, I've seen it discussed on ""ER"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" and that helped me, too. I think we need to talk more openly about these things. To share our losses so we don't feel so alone and to share the ways we've dealt with it. It would have helped me, and my partner, if we hadn't felt so alone in our loss, and if we had been able to find, in others, a compass to guide us back to normal life. This common loss, this secret pain, is better when brought out of the darkness and into the air.Need help? In the U.S., call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline."

They're scaling the slippery toadstools, patting the White Rabbit's ears, and vying to perch like Buddhas on the Mad Hatter's top hat. They are their kid selves again. The buoyant mood is because this crew of homeschooled teenagers, ranging in age for 11 to 18, is celebrating the fact that just under two weeks ago they did something quite remarkable. In an off-Broadway theater on 43rd Street, they staged a production of Alice's Adventures of Wonderland in a sold out weekend run. The show was entirely teen-directed, acted, and produced. Parents and other adult friends played an important supportive role, but for the most part everything - from the lighting to props, the stage managing to ticket sales, the choreography to the character development - was done by this group of New York teens.  (Photo: Katherine Bourbeau)It's fitting that the cast and crew are now capering like seven-year olds on the statue. ""For me, Alice is not about madness, it's about childhood and dreams,"" says fifteen year old Leo Lion, as he looks on. Leo founded Firebird Youth Theater three years ago and has directed all three of the company's shows, including Alice. ""I wanted the show to capture the imagination of childhood, just like Lewis Carroll captured it in the book.""With its simple yet whimsical props and costumes and its clever, playful staging, Firebird's production of Alice did indeed capture the childhood wonder of Wonderland. When Alice (played with a delightful mix of innocence and fearlessness by twelve-year old Leigh Stern) fell down the rabbit hole, her descent was staged sideways on, from the audience's point of view. Alice sat on a stage box flailing her legs and arms, framed by a hula-hoop decked out in foliage, as she considered aloud whether she might ""fall right through the earth."" A big disc painted with a hypnotic spiral spun behind her and two cast members paced up and down on either side, holding shelves with books and teacups. Altogether the scene skillfully suggested the dreamy, bizarre, and dizzying fall into Wonderland, but also the wondrous way that children, perhaps playing in a park, might stage the famous fall.   Fifteen-year old director, Leo Lion (Photo: Katherine Bourbeau)Alice has always been one of Leo's favorite books and honoring the Lewis Carroll original was very important to him. Leo adapted the story with the company's sixteen-year old stage manager, Thomas Pflanz. They produced a script that stays very close to the book, not just in the characters and scenes but also in the language. According to Leo, ""Disney derivatives of Alice, and even avant-garde stage versions, tend to overlook the beautiful writing, and especially the funny and clever dialogue."" The props, sets, and costuming in the show were similarly loyal to the original. Leigh and her mother Irene Stern worked together to produce an Alice dress that was an almost replica of the dress drawn by John Tenniel in the original illustrations. The Mad Hatter's tea party was also staged in a way that is deeply reminiscent of Tenniel's drawing of the same scene, with the Mad Hatter, Dormouse, and March Hare sitting in a line beside the bemused and unimpressed Alice.  (Photo: Katherine Bourbeau)And when eighteen-year old Sydney Harris began creating the show-stopping Dodo puppet, she returned to the original book. ""I wanted to capture the huge, rotund shape of Tenniel's dodo bird.""  (Photo: Katherine Bourbeau)Sydney also composed the music for the show and was delighted to find that Carroll's poems translated easily into song: ""His poems have a distinct rhythm and they stick to it."" Sydney researched traditional music used in the 18th and 19th centuries for quadrille dancing and then produced The Lobster Quadrille: a highlight of the show that was sung and danced by PJ Lodin (15), as the desolate yet hilariously diva-like Mock Turtle, and Alioune Fall (15), as the cheeky cockney Griffin.Research was a big part of the process not only for the scriptwriters and the creative team. The cast put time into researching their characters. PJ discovered that Mock Turtle soup was turtle soup made with beef when funds were short. For PJ, this connected to the way that ""everything about the Mock Turtle and his stories is just a bit off."" Other actors did research outside of the text too. My own eleven year old son Benny Rendell looked into stories and pictures of Prince Albert (alive during Carroll's lifetime) to embellish his character: a dotty yet slightly sinister King of Hearts. Fourteen-year old Emily Mondrus, who played a perfectly panicked White Rabbit, turned to Harpo Marx who she felt offered something rabbit-like that she could bring to her role.Emily also discovered something about herself during the show. ""I became a rabbit!"" she recalls. ""For the first time ever, I wasn't conscious of being on the stage, I wasn't thinking about what people would say about me. I was simply the White Rabbit.""

Jeremiah Burch, who played a deliciously dormant Dormouse, has been in a number of TV shows, films, and professional productions. ""Leo has been doing this a while now and he's very professional, so we all respect him and he respects us."" It seems most of the cast and crew agreed that even though they were taking direction from a fifteen year old and being stage managed by a sixteen year old, it felt no different from more standard adult-led productions.In fact, sometimes it was better. Leigh felt that the teen environment gave her room to really explore being Alice and she felt comfortable making suggestions and having her own voice heard. Fourteen year old Isabelle Pflanz, who played a fearsome Queen of Hearts and a hilarious semi-comatose frog, said that in Firebird productions ""everyone gets much more of a say and we bond much more to the show.""""Bonding"" is a word that comes up again and again as I talk to the cast and crew while the spring sun begins to set over Central Park. Destiny Vega, a stagehand for the show who is eighteen years old, talks about the company becoming ""one big family"" over the course of the production: ""We had our arguments, our laughter and our cries, but we bonded really tightly."" Destiny's fellow stagehand, sixteen-year old Daniel Zuzworsky, enjoyed the camaraderie too and said the production allowed him to really connect with old and new friends alike. (Photo: Katherine Bourbeau)Firebird's resident comic PJ Lodin was the only one not to talk about the connections formed during the show. Indeed, he claimed that because the cast are a group of ""freakish, undersocialized homeschoolers"" who are fearful of going outside or making friends, the whole show was done using avatars while each cast member was plugged into a giant techno-vat in their own homes (PJ also claimed that director Leo gained the respect of his peers by wrestling to death a giant bear!). Bears, avatars, and jokes aside, PJ raises a good point about stereotypes and expectations. Leo describes how he often faces ""a healthy dose of underestimation"" when he tells people what he and Firebird Youth Theater are doing together.

Prosecutors rested their case against Tsarnaev on Monday, March 30, 2015, after jurors saw gruesome autopsy photos and heard a medical examiner describe the devastating injuries suffered by the three people who died in the 2013 terror attack.

No, do you really believe it is possible?It's easy to believe in redemption for yourself. I mean, come on, you aren't that bad. But, do you believe redemption is possible for everyone?These are questions that we as Christians in America really have to start asking ourselves. Redemption is a basic tenant of the Christian faith, yet so many Christians doubt its reality. It's all fine and dandy when someone wants to be redeemed from lying or stealing or smoking dope. But, when it's a major issue, Christians back off and give up on the person. It's almost as if we put a limit on God's grace, and we say that for minor offenses, you can be redeemed. But, if you have screwed up majorly, then there is no hope for you. Here in lies the reason so many Christians support the death penalty.I'm going to just go ahead and say it: if you support the death penalty, then you don't really believe in redemption.I know many people will balk at that point, but hear me out. If you believe redemption is possible for everyone, then the last thing you would want is for them to die. No, you would want to give that person every chance to turn around and make-up for their offenses. At the least, you would want the person to realize the pain his or her offenses caused, and allow that person a chance to at least ask for forgiveness. If one truly believed in redemption, then they would want to give that person every opportunity to be redeemed. After the Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was sentenced to death, I watched the Internet blow up with Christians celebrating. One after another chimed in with their remarks.When it comes to people like Tsarnaev and Islamic people, the sentiment among many Christians seems to be ""kill them all and let the Lord separate them."" But this, my friends, is the opposite of the Christian theology of redemption.We claim to believe that God can save anyone, yet we act like it's only possible for minor sins.We claim to believe that the blood of Christ was powerful enough to cover up any sin, yet if the person really screwed up, then we say things that sound like just the opposite.The problem is that what we claim to believe is not what we actually believe -- or sometimes, what we even hope to be true.Just think about this: how would you feel sharing a spot in Heaven with Tsarnaev? What about Hitler? What about the person that molested you as a child? Or how about the person who killed your child? Your parent? Or you?These are hard questions in which to ponder, and right now with the death sentencing of Tsarnaev, I think it's time that we start pondering them. We cannot claim to believe (and hope) that God can redeem everyone and anyone if we celebrate taking a person's life that committed an offense.Now listen, I get it. I'm not saying this is easy. The carnal side of me wants to see Tsarnaev on death row, too. I mean, he walked calmly into a crowd (including children!) and placed a bomb! That is major. It is also enough to make one wonder whether someone with a mind like that can even want to be redeemed. I understand where the anger comes from because I feel it myself.But, there's another side of me -- the spiritual side -- that believes that redemption truly is possible for everyone, and I do not believe it is my place (or anyone else's) to cut short his life, making that redemption impossible on this side of life. He has to be punished for his offenses, yes. But, is death the only punishment worthy? How is this any different that the justice we see in extremist Islam? Christianity is supposed to be a religion that is different and separate from all of the others, and the thing that separates us is our theology of redemption. If we do not really live out that theology, then we aren't any different.The bottom line is if we really believe the words of Jesus, and the theology of Paul, then we know that the blood of Christ really is for everyone, and we have to start facing the reality that the death penalty is in complete opposition to the theology we claim to believe. It is time that American Christians either start backing up the theology they claim to believe, or simply face the fact that they don't really believe in the power of redemption and just say so.------------------------------------------------------------------------This post was originally from Brandon's website, TheGayChristian.com.
