2,HOME & LIVING,House Cats: Let's Take a Walk on the Flea Larvae Side,"Thom Nickels, Contributor

As a relatively new cat owner, I did not expect my life (and my house) to be turned upside down with the invasion of flea eggs and flea larvae.",2013-05-06,"A black and white cat relaxing on a bed.

As a relatively new cat owner, I did not expect my life (and my house) to be turned upside down with the invasion of flea eggs and flea larvae. It began when my cat Zoey contracted fleas the night she escaped into the (feral) terrain of my neighborhood. Rescued a mere twenty minutes after her foray into freedom, it wasn't long before Zoey began to scratch herself St. Vitas dance style. What I had assumed was just a simple feline itch turned out to be a major infestation. A friend came to my rescue and transported Zoey to his house (where she was shampooed more than once) while I began the long process of fumigating the house.  Flea larvae, unfortunately, can stay put in rugs and furniture for up to six months. Zoey, therefore, was put on a long range sabbatical until my house was safe. At the local supermarket, I bought several bottles of Hartz Ultra Guard Plus, a flea and tick home spray. I washed, scrubbed, sprayed, vacuumed, and then repeated the process many times over. But just when I thought I had the problem licked, a handful of fleas would leap from the floor onto my hands when I used the computer.  ""They're still here!"" I said to the friend who had Zoey. ""This house is as clean as an operating room but the bugs still manage to jump on me from every angle."" (Fleas, by the way, cannot fly; they take leap frog style jumps from the floor or where they're nesting to what they hope will be a warm furry host. Since I am warm but not furry, they wound up, as the Rolling Stones used to say, 'Under my Thumb.' But random killings didn't deter the more unruly, hungry ones from finding ways to jump into my socks.)  While I was never reduced to Zoey's excruciating St. Vitas dance experience, I'd sometimes wake up in the middle of the night with an intense urge to scratch. Were the fleas, like those Verizon Fios advertisements, everywhere?  But just as I was on the verge of giving up and domesticating the invaders, the fleas vanished. Arrangements were made to bring Zoey home, but then something else happened: my friend's mother, an elderly woman in ill health, had fallen hopelessly in love with Zoey and told her son, ""I cannot live without the cat."" Taking Zoey away from someone who claimed to love her wouldn't be easy. I did not want to go on record as having killed an elderly woman, so the son and I had to come up with a plan. Following Ernest Hemingway's dictum -- ""One cat just leads to another"" -- we devised a plan to find a look-a-like cat and exchange the felines on the sly. To do this we contacted a local woman known as the ""cat lady."" Now, the ""cat lady"" specializes in finding cats for families and individuals who want pets, so we put her to work to find a Zoey clone for a midnight transfer. A transfer cat with black and white tuxedo markings, a virtual Xerox of Zoey, was located. ""The cat lady is a genius,"" I told my friend, mindful all the while that no cat, like any human being, is ever perfect. There's always the fly in the ointment, the unsightly blemish, the unfortunate... ""but."" This, despite Alexander Dumas' observation that, ""the cat, an aristocrat, merits our esteem, while the dog is only a scurvy type who got his position by low flatteries."" Snoopy's problem wasn't just her name, it was a personality ravaged by the discomfort of a skin disease so advanced that it was all she could do to not act like a little mouse, scampering this way and that, afraid of her own shadow, or doorbells, footsteps, or the on and off click of my kitchen night light. At first our inclination was to ""save"" Snoopy, to bring her to a good and honest vet (today, this seems to be an oxymoron) , who wouldn't taunt us with fear techniques until we maxed out our credit cards on Hocus Pocus tests, biopsies, injections, and God knows what else.  The vet we found crushed any hopes we had of finding ""one good honest man or woman in Dodge."" In the long run, it didn't matter anyway, since Snoopy's prognosis wasn't good. Regrettably, she was sent back to her former home with the vet's dire summing up that her failing health began with an old infestation of fleas and mites. So it all comes back to fleas, invaders not from space but from the feral world of the city. Call the flea connection the down side of serendipity, I suppose, but there was no way I could throw in the towel. I had no choice but to get out the Hartz Ultra Guard and spray the area where Snoppy had stayed put for the better part of a week, and then make plans to head back to the drawing board in my quest for a Zoey Xerox."
3,WELLNESS,17 Powerful Bodyweight Exercises For Strength And Speed,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bodyweight-exercises-strength-speed_us_5b9d1e2de4b03a1dcc849773,2. Plyo Push-Up Begin in a standard push-up position with elbows bent at 90 degrees and tucked close to the body. Now push,2013-05-06,Side view of a young woman working out and doing lunges,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1e2d1f00002c00217bc9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," By Dave SmithGetting in shape without access to a gym or any fancy equipment is totally doable. In fact, bodyweight exercises can not only build muscle and burn fat, they've been shown to improve athletic performance and build speed and power, too. Make those moves explosive and they can help build endurance and really help elevate an athlete's game. Before getting started, keep in mind that plyometric training should focus on awesome form and all-out effort. That's why explosive exercises like these are best placed at the start of a workout before muscles are fatigued and performance starts to slow down. Greatist Expert Matt Delaney suggests focusing on just three to four plyometric moves at the beginning of a workout, performing them no more than three times per week. (Giving the body ample time to recover is key.)More from Greatist: 10 Healthy Cinco de Mayo Recipes Why Men Should Get More Sleep The 25 Healthiest Colleges In AmericaWhen it's time to bust a move, short sets (just three to five reps) is often all it takes to get a killer workout that may end with jelly legs and an amazing feeling of self-satisfaction. And for those who want to keep the heart rate high between weight training sets, these moves can work well sprinkled in with the rest, says Greatist Expert Joe Venarre. From fiery to flat-out explosive, here are 17 strength- and speed-boosting exercises to get the job done.Slightly Flammable 1. Reverse Lunge Knee-Up  Begin by standing on one foot (think Karate Kid), then step the opposite foot backwards into a reverse lunge. Powerfully push through the front foot and bring the opposite knee towards the chest. Quickly step back into a reverse lunge and repeat!2. Plyo Push-Up Begin in a standard push-up position with elbows bent at 90 degrees and tucked close to the body. Now push it with enough force to jump the hands off the ground and quickly clap together before landing. This one might be best to practice from the knees and with the goal of working towards doing them from the toes.3. Box Drill Fire up the calves by jumping ’round an imaginary box. Begin by balancing on the right foot with a slightly bent knee. Swing both arms forward and hop to the left (don't miss the landing!). Staying on the same leg, hop forward, then hop to the right and finally in reverse back to the starting point. Switch legs and reverse the direction.4. Standing Long Jump Flashback to elementary school track meets! For this explosive lower body move, stand with feet hip-width apart and crouch into a squatting position with the arms back. Next, spring forward with both feet remaining together and land on the balls of the feet with the knees bent. Go the hang of things? Spring right back into action for the next jump (with no rest in between).5. Frog Squat Jump: Begin in a wide stance, feet a bit wider than shoulder-width apart, with toes turned slightly out. Keeping the chest up, drop into a deep squat position, hands reaching to the floor. Now explode upwards into a jump (yes, this is the frog-looking part!). Land softly and quickly repeat with an emphasis on the height of each jump.6. Lateral Lunge Slightly easier than doing overhead splits, a lateral lunge is still awesome for improving flexibility. (Being flexible is super-important since muscles generate more power when they contract through a full range of motion. Flexibility = explosiveness!) To complete the move, stand with feet together and then lunge to the right. Make sure the toes of both feet face forward and weight goes back into the heels. Reach the arms forward if you need extra help balancing.Definitely Combustible  7. Plyometric Deadlift Stand on the left leg and bend forward at the hips (become a drinking bird) until the right leg and chest are about parallel to the floor (yes, the left hamstrings are supposed to feel the burn!). In one quick movement swing the arms forward, raise the chest and jump up off the floor. Softly land on the left leg again and slowly lower back into the starting position.8. Lateral Triple Jump This move teaches the body to change directions quickly and powerfully. Stand on the right foot, bend the knee slightly and hop sideways as far as possible, landing on the right foot again. Immediately leap forward to land on the left foot. Finish the move by jumping forward one more time to land on both feet. Sound confusing? It's just a hop, skip and a jump!9. Alternating Lunge Jumps Remember the running man? Begin in a lunge and jump up as high as possible while simultaneously switching the lunge stance in mid-air. Land with the opposite foot forward and then jump again. Think height, not speed. This one is all about generating vertical power.10. Tuck Jumps Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, crouch down just a bit and then spring up into the highest jump possible. Quickly tuck the knees to the chest and then extend them down to land softly on the toes. Immediately jump back up -- there's no time to rest during this one!11. Side Plank Star: Every major body movement originates from the body's core. (Not sure? Try running without flexing the glutes, abs, or lower back!) To get explosive to the core, start in a side plank position with the planted elbow directly beneath the shoulder and both legs stacked. Now, keeping the core muscles tight, raise the top leg as high as possible to form a star position. Return the leg back down and repeat on the same side.Yowzers -- That's Explosive! 12. Full-Body Plyometric Push-Up Who said people weren't meant to fly? Lower into a push-up position with elbows wide and at a 90-degree angle. Explosively push through the hands and keep an extremely tight core so that the entire body momentarily floats off the floor. Keep that core tight upon landing so that the hips don't drop towards the floor. Move right into the next rep!13. Kneeling Squat Jump Ready to kick things up a notch? Begin this (seriously) advanced move kneeling on the ground with the legs spread a littler wider than the hips. Draw the arms back and then forcefully swing them forward to generate enough momentum to jump up into a squatting position. Step back down into a kneeling position and repeat.14. Horizontal Jump to Tuck Jump Here's another power-producing leg exercise that teaches the body to change directions very quickly. Stand with both feet together. Bend the knees slightly and jump as far as possible to one side. Upon landing, immediately perform a tuck jump. That’s one! Repeat in the opposite direction with no pausing between reps.15. Plyometric Push-Up to Squat Combine upper and lower body explosiveness into one awesome (and super-advanced!) move. Start in traditional push-up position, and then quickly push through the hands as hard as possible to generate some momentum. As the body rises, tuck the knees to the chest and simultaneously bring the feet to land under the body. The landing position is a deep squat. Hold it for a second and then jump back into a push-up position to repeat.16. Single-Leg Jump Squat Balance on one leg, grounding your weight in the heel and lower into a single-leg squat. Extend the arms forward for balance. Hold momentarily at the bottom of the squat, then throw the arms downwards to generate momentum and jump up off the standing leg. Softly land on the same leg and then head straight into the next rep.17. Concentric Box Jump This is one of the best exercises to build powerful legs and an amazing vertical leaping ability. Grab a seat on a step or bench and set another higher step or box (use something solid!) about a foot in front of the first bench. From a seated position, push through the heels, throw the arms forward and jump up onto the box landing with two feet. Step down, grab a seat and do it again.While there is no ""one best way"" to exercise, explosive bodyweight training can be a great addition for athletes and non-athletes alike. For those trying these moves for the first time, be sure grab an experienced friend or personal trainer before getting explosive. Remember, the goal is always quality over quantity once things start heating up!What explosive exercises do you use to improve your game? Tell us in the comments below."
