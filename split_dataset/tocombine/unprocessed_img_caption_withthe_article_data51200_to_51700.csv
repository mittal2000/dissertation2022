6,POLITICS,Donald Trump Wants To Break Up Big Banks,Zach Carter and Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-big-banks_us_578d30fde4b0a0ae97c2fb9d,He's trying to divide Democrats by going to the left of Hillary Clinton.,2016-07-18,"Donald Trump's campaign manager broke the news about the party position on Glass-Steagall earlier Monday, surprising many.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578d569519000026008a6e16.jpeg?cache=USeClBWKa2&ops=crop_40_153_3460_1894%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The GOP threw a grenade into Democratic Party politics on Monday, calling to break up the nation’s big banks. The party platform approved at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland offers official support for reinstating the Glass-Steagall law, which separates riskier securities trading from traditional commercial banking. The move would require busting up the six largest banks in America.“We support reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in high-risk investment,” the platform reads.The GOP platform language is an economic policy earthquake. Republicans have long opposed financial regulation in any form. The official support for Glass-Steagall reverses decades of Republican orthodoxy, and drives a wedge between progressive Democrats and Hillary Clinton. The presumptive nominee repeatedly rejected calls to reinstate Glass-Steagall during the primary season, ridiculing her challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), for supporting the policy. The Clinton campaign’s Wall Street reform agenda makes more modest changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, and was greeted warmly by the financial establishment. Progressive icon Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has authored legislation to reinstate Glass-Steagall. Warren has been mentioned repeatedly as a potential vice presidential partner for Hillary Clinton, but recent rumors suggest that Clinton is closer to naming Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), despite a flat, uninspiring trial rally last week. Warren is the most popular figure in the party outside of President Barack Obama and the two primary rivals, Clinton and Sanders.The Depression-era Glass-Steagall law prevented banks from using taxpayer-backed funds to fuel risky activities in the securities market. Glass-Steagall advocates argue that reimplementing the law would protect taxpayers from losses associated with risky trades, while also increasing the costs of such trades for hedge funds and private equity firms that do not benefit from public subsidies.Despite the GOP support for the regulation, the policy details of party platforms often do not matter. There are no formal consequences for any president who fails to live up to the terms of the party platform, and fulfilling every plank is effectively impossible in modern politics. But with his latest Glass-Steagall gambit, presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump is trying to wrest the populist bank reform mantle away from the Democratic Party, after years of Republican support for big banks. The official Democratic Party platform is expected to differ substantially from the policy pronouncements Clinton issued during the primary. Party leaders and activists negotiated a Democratic platform that embraces Glass-Steagall, even after Clinton herself rejected the idea. Trump’s support for Glass-Steagall is not only a finger in the eye for Democratic financial reform advocates ― it also scrambles Republican politics. Re-implementing Glass-Stegall would be a radical change that Republicans in Congress have opposed for decades. And the GOP donor class ― which includes a large financier constituency ― is not enamored with resurrecting Glass-Steagall, even if supporting it would make things harder for Democrats.GOP members of Congress have also been working to repeal Dodd-Frank ever since it was passed. That orthodoxy is maintained in the platform.“The Dodd-Frank law, the Democrats’ legislative Godzilla, is crushing small and community banks and other lenders,” the document reads."
7,POLITICS,Trump's Campaign Manager Says He'll Channel 'Law And Order' Richard Nixon,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-richard-nixon-rnc_us_578cda12e4b0fa896c3f2b2e,"Paul Manafort says this is no time for “happy talk.""",2016-07-18,Richard Nixon celebrates after receiving the presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention in Miami in 1968.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578ce0b52400002700b31aa6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― As Donald Trump searched for a template for his acceptance speech, the model he chose was Richard Nixon’s infamous 1968 “law and order” speech on behalf of a silent and sullen middle class.At a somewhat similar time of stress and struggle in America and the world, Trump chose that speech as a starting point, his campaign chief told reporters at a Bloomberg breakfast Monday morning.“We started on the speech a couple of weeks ago,” said Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. “We looked at previous conventions speeches; the one he focused on, though, was Nixon in 1968.”In that speech, given only months after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy and amid rioting in many U.S. cities, Nixon cited the fears and resentments of “forgotten Americans” and vowed to return “order” to the streets and country.The speech was aimed largely at white middle-class voters in border and Midwest states whom Alabama Gov. George Wallace was also appealing to in an openly racist way.As a third-party candidate, Wallace was destined to win the Deep South in the fall, but the Nixon team devised a “law and order” theme ― a vow to restore order in the cities of the North ― that would appeal to the same voters and bring them into the Republican camp.The aim was not to “unite” America, as Nixon claimed, but to target enough white middle-class support (as well as support from a smattering of other groups) to win.Manafort made clear that Trump’s core strategy in 2016 is the same, and that in the campaign’s view, the “angst” created by recent police shootings of African-Americans, as well as attacks on police, create an “opportunity” for the campaign.Trump will not offer the convention or the American people “happy talk” about the need for unity, he said.Accordingly, Manafort added, Trump will stick with his modified “Muslim ban,” now tailored to countries with patterns of terrorism ― including, he said, France and Belgium.The Trump campaign will attempt to tie President Barack Obama and especially presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to “the same failed leadership in the world that is now causing unrest in the cities.”They will argue that Clinton’s troubles with her emails and the Justice Department’s decision not to prosecute her are an example of a corrupt law enforcement system that people in cities resent.Manafort cited Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s recent critical remarks about Trump as another example of a rigged system.“All of that resonates and causes unrest in the cities that get out of control,” he said.Protests outside the convention hall will only amplify Trump’s message, Manafort argued. “It will show a lawlessness and lack of respect for political discourse.” That’s a remarkable statement from the top aide of a candidate known for his inflammatory discourse. Trump’s attack on the Obama-Clinton team’s “double standard” of justice is justified, he said.“Yes, it is a harsh message,” he conceded, but it is “truth-telling.”As if to prove the point, Manafort laughingly dismissed Trump’s lack of endorsements from the Bush family, specifically former President George W. Bush. He would “like” W’s endorsement, he said, but disparaged the former leader as the least likely major figure you want at your side in this era.“If you want to pick a politician to be for you, who would you pick in the Republican Party?” he asked rhetorically. The answer: not George W. Bush.Manafort also harshly dismissed Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) – who is not at the convention and not endorsing Trump – as a sore loser who is being told a “dumb, dumb, dumb thing”: that he can boost his chances in 2020 if he stays away from Trump.“John Kasich is being petulant,” Manafort said.And he dismissed the anti-Trump movement at the convention as a “few recalcitrant delegates.”The convention as a whole will focus, he added, on trying to tell the American people about Trump’s good personal qualities as a father, businessman and philanthropist.But there is “angst and opportunity” in the streets and in the world, Manafort said, and Trump will seize the moment to claim that “strong leadership” can bring calm, order, jobs and peace.How exactly he’ll do this is, of course, not clear. In the meantime, look to Nixon to see how to sell the message.Here is one famous passage from Nixon’s speech about bringing law and order in the name of the “forgotten"" majority of Americans:“As we look at America, we see cities enveloped in smoke and flame. We hear sirens in the night. We see Americans dying on distant battlefields abroad. We see Americans hating each other; fighting each other; killing each other at home.Listen to Nixon’s answers to those questions. “It is another voice, it is a quiet voice in the tumult of the shouting. It is the voice of the great majority of Americans, the forgotten Americans, the non-shouters, the non-demonstrators. They’re not racists or sick; they’re not guilty of the crime that plagues the land; they are black, they are white; they’re native-born and foreign-born; they’re young and they’re old.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

In uniform I get nasty hateful looks and out of uniform some consider me a threat.”Jackson was one of three officers killed this weekend in the line of duty by 29-year-old Gavin Eugene Long. It’s still unclear if the gunman sought to retaliate against law enforcement or if the shootings were related to another crime. The latest attack on police came on the heels of rising public outcry over the spate of violence against people of color by law enforcement officials. At least 146 black people have been killed by police this year, according to a project by The Guardian to track such deaths.In an interview with The Washington Post, Joycelyn Jackson called her brother Montrell “a wonderful person” who loved his newborn son. She told the newspaper that she understood the motivation behind the Black Lives Matter movement, but condemned acts of violence against law enforcement.“It’s coming to the point where no lives matter,” she said. “Whether you’re black or white or Hispanic or whatever.”In his earlier Facebook message, Jackson wrote that in such “trying times” society must band together “because hate takes too much energy.”“Please don’t let hate infect your heart. This city MUST and WILL get better. I’m working in these streets so any protestors, officers, friends, family, or whoever, if you see me and need a hug or want to say a prayer. I got you.”Jackson was survived by his wife and son. A GoFundMe page has been set up in his honor."
9,MEDIA,Journalists Cross Fingers They Won't Be Arrested Covering GOP Convention Protests,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-convention-media-protests_us_578ccb1be4b0867123e1c124,"No reporters were arrested four years ago, but they've been grabbed at mass protests since then.",2016-07-18,Cleveland police recently received training on dealing with the media at the GOP convention.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578ccb9d19000026008a6bc7.jpeg?cache=8KdDinbyMA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― News organizations have been preparing for the possibility of their employees covering political unrest during the Republican National Convention, with some offering training and equipment typically reserved for war correspondents. Yet even a body armor-clad reporter or photographer could miss the action if arrested. The National Press Photographers Association recently conducted a series of trainings with Cleveland police to help minimize the chances that journalists will spend a few hours, or a night, in jail. Mickey Osterreicher, general counsel for the NPPA, described preventing the arrest of journalists as a “triple win.”“Officers and departments wouldn’t get sued for violating people’s constitutional rights,” he told HuffPost. “Citizens and journalists would be able to exercise those rights. And ultimately the public would be informed as to what’s going on.”Osterreicher held those hour-and-a-half training sessions with police last month in Cleveland ― and more recently in Philadelphia, site of next week’s Democratic National Convention. The NPPA received a grant from the Sigma Delta Chi Foundation of the Society of Professional Journalists for the trainings. “We greatly appreciate those departments’ willingness to help avoid unnecessary and improper interference, harassment and arrests of those doing nothing more than exercising a constitutional right,” the Society of Professional Journalists said in a statement Sunday. Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia, public information officer for the Cleveland police, acknowledged holding media-specific trainings, though she did not elaborate at length. “We had trained our officers relative to the rights of members of the media as well as the general public in terms of filming, first amendment, etc,” she wrote in an email to HuffPost. Osterreicher said both cities already have laws on the books for dealing with media at protests, so the sessions largely offered an opportunity to reiterate established policies. One notable change was made to Cleveland’s plan for the Republican convention as a result of the training, he said. The city originally maintained that someone recording police activity needed to be at least 30 feet back, Osterreicher said, but after discussions, it revised the guidelines so there is no specific distance.“Setting arbitrary distances is difficult,” Osterreicher said. “I think it’s more important for officers to be able to exercise their discretion, whereas 3 feet might be fine in one situation and 300 feet when you have an active shooter isn’t far enough.”Nearly two dozen journalists were arrested during the 2008 Republican convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, which prompted Osterreicher and some other free speech advocates to conduct sessions with police prior to the 2012 gatherings in Tampa, Florida, and Charlotte, North Carolina.“We didn’t have any journalists arrested and I’m hoping to have a repeat of that in 2016,” he said. “And quite frankly so are the police departments. I mean, none of them want to have a bad image.”But the mass protests since the last political conventions and the incidents of violence and angry rhetoric aimed at journalists during Donald Trump’s rallies have raised concerns about journalists getting swept up by police. Dozens of journalists were arrested covering the 2014 protests over the police killing of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. More recently, several members of the media were arrested while covering demonstrations over the police killing of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.“The events of recent weeks involving police and protesters, as well as the politically charged atmosphere generally have left many concerned that reporters and photographers may face additional confrontations covering the nominating conventions this year,” Bruce D. Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said in a statement. “Media attorneys have talked with police and city officials in both Cleveland and Philadelphia to help ensure that journalists are not impeded in their job to inform the public. If that is not the case, however, we stand ready to help.”The Reporters Committee, as it’s done for more than four decades, has set up hotlines for journalists arrested or facing unwarranted interference while reporting on the conventions. Beyond getting arrested, there are other obstacles that could prevent journalists from fully bearing witness. On Sunday, the Society of Professional Journalists, the NPPA and the Radio Television Digital News Association expressed concern that restrictions in the designated “event zone” near the Republican convention could “hinder journalists’ jobs and safety.” Specifically, the groups criticized the banning of gas masks, which some journalists carry in case of protests involving tear gas, and the prohibiting of bags large enough to carry broadcast equipment. Another concern that’s arisen at mass demonstrations, Osterreicher said, is law enforcement denying journalists the same rights as the public. During a Ferguson protest, for example, police ordered journalists into a press pen while the public was allowed to stand on the street ― and record the demonstration if they wanted to. “One of the things I always talk about is that the press doesn’t have any greater right than the public,” Osterreicher said, “but they certainly don’t have any less rights, either.”"

The site reports it obtained a letter from Swift’s attorney that was sent to the rapper in February. In the letter, Swift’s attorney informs West of a California law requiring two-party consent for recordings, meaning approval must be had from both sides of the line to tape a conversation. If Swift wasn’t aware she was being recorded, West committed a criminal offense. “Demand is hereby made that you immediately destroy all such recordings, provide us of assurance that this has been done, and also assurance that these recordings have not been previously disseminated,” the letter reads, according to TMZ.If Swift sees fit, she has the right to file a lawsuit against West and Kim Kardashian, who released the recording, for breaking the law. The Huffington Post has reached out to reps for both Swift and West and will update this post accordingly. "

He couldn’t care less about the present or future of the Republican Party, let alone arcane rules of procedure.What rebellious delegates tried to do later on Monday was force a roll-call vote on the rules, in hopes of gaining a little more time to talk around their Trump-supporting counterparts.But GOP and Trump officials contended that some of those who had signed petitions calling for a roll-call vote had, at the last minute and at the prompting of the GOP’s floor whip team, signed another petition to remove their names ― and thus moot the move by their foes.We’ll see if anyone can follow that paper trail.The Trump forces have evidently decided they cannot under any circumstances take their boots off the neck of the convention, lest it somehow, someway, get away from them.That attitude betrays a contempt for the very mechanics by which Trump himself managed to force his way onto center stage as a presidential candidate, even though he had never run for office before. He’s the cowbird of politics: He lays his eggs in the nests of other birds that he then pushes out of their homes.But the risks he runs are twofold.One is that Trump will so bottle up the emotions of doubting delegates that he could cause a political explosion in Cleveland.The other is that sullen Republicans in key states he needs to win the presidency will sit on their hands in the general election. Among the delegates who wanted to get a roll-call vote Monday were those from Iowa, Virginia and Colorado ― three toss-up states that Trump desperately needs to win. Members of the Colorado delegation walked out in protest after the rules were approved on a voice vote.Trump’s actions today betray a lack of confidence, even as he claims to be the most confident man in the world.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
12,COLLEGE,The Republican Plan For Higher Education: Less Red Tape And Less Money,"Mikhail Zinshteyn, The Hechinger Report",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/higher-ed-republicans_us_578cf04ce4b0a0ae97c2b287,“Republicans are very concerned that we get a good return on the money we are spending.”,2016-07-18,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, left, shakes hands with Gov. Mike Pence, R-Ind., during a campaign event to announce Pence as the vice presidential running mate on, Saturday, July 16, 2016, in New York.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During the Republican and Democratic conventions, The Hechinger Report will publish a new story each day, examining what the party proposals might mean for the future of education. Our staff reporters will provide education coverage from Cleveland and Philadelphia.Past is prologue.That’s what Republicans promise in the higher education platform they’ll finalize at their national convention in Cleveland: an approach that follows the direction they’ve already taken in Congress.Fewer regulations for colleges and universities. Less red tape for students.Less money.“Obviously what we do legislatively is a statement of our philosophy and our principles,” said Virginia Foxx, Republican chair of the House subcommittee that oversees higher education and co-chair of the GOP platform committee.While the party’s presumptive nominee for president, Donald Trump, hasn’t said much about higher education policy, he has mentioned a proposal here and there, such as allowing student loans to be refinanced — something that is not allowed today, and a position he shares with progressive Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — and tying the availability of loans to the perceived market value of students’ majors.“An enormous amount of hardworking taxpayer money goes into education in this country,” Foxx said in an interview. “Republicans are very concerned that we get a good return on the money we are spending.”Proponents of increasing the amount of federal money going into higher education see it differently. The GOP would “massively reduce federal support for students,” said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.Related: Some religious colleges forgo federal funding, staying free of civil rights rules This year the budget blueprint introduced by Republicans in the House included shaving federal spending by $6.5 trillion over the next decade. That would have a significant impact on the Pell program, which annually provides direct grants to more than eight million college-going students from families with typical incomes of $40,000 or less. The education advocacy group the Committee for Education Funding, which opposes the cuts, calculates that they would reduce Pell spending by $78 billion over 10 years.The GOP budget proposal calls for capping the maximum Pell grant per student at around $5,800 per year for the next 10 years, while President Barack Obama has wanted to tie it to inflation. The House budget would also eliminate a subsidy under which the federal government covers the interest on Stafford loans for lower-income students while they are enrolled in school. The Committee for Education Funding says that cut would add up to $27 billion over 10 years.This year’s actual spending bills from appropriations committees in the House and Senate — also Republican-controlled — are more modest in their proposed changes than the party’s budget wish list. Both would remove more than $1 billion from Pell for next year, Democrats complain. Republicans argue spending alone doesn’t improve access to higher education. They have also targeted regulation, saying it vastly increases universities’ expenses — something higher-education lobbyists have also argued, though there’s no reliable research about how much regulation costs schools — and complicates college-going for students.Lamar Alexander, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, has been pushing to simplify the federal financial aid form, reducing the number of questions students must answer from more than 100 to two. (The idea of streamlining the form has also been supported by Democrats, including Obama.)Related: Tangled process of applying for financial aid deepens college affordability crisis Student advocacy groups oppose the funding changes. The nonprofit, nonpartisan The Institute for College Access and Success, or TICAS, estimates that removing the subsidy from Stafford loans would cost students an average additional $4,900 apiece over 10 years. They say a cap on Pell grants would particularly hurt low-income students at a time when the grants’ purchasing power has already declined dramatically.But House Republicans criticize the way that Pell grants work. Students who go to school less than half time, for example, are eligible for varying amounts of Pell money.Related: Candidate’s comment reopens controversy over whether college is worth the cost “I think too much money is given out with Pell grants sometimes without our knowing whether the students are going to stay in school [or] even complete the semester,” Foxx said.A former community college president, Foxx said students who go to college should do it full time. “If you give them too much time on their hands, their interests go into other things.”Republicans have at various times also criticized student-loan repayment provisions that allow borrowers to hold their repayments at 10 percent of their incomes and dismisses any remaining debt after 20 to 25 years, and after 10 years if the graduates work for a nonprofit organization or the government.Some analysts have criticized these provisions for being giveaways to those with graduate-school debt, whose six-figure loans are often accompanied by high incomes. Getting rid of them would save taxpayers nearly $27 billion over 10 years an analyst told the House Budget Committee last year. “I would be really surprised if your average American knew that we had a government loan program that provided hundreds of thousands of dollars of loan forgiveness for students going to graduate school,” said Jason Delisle, a higher education policy analyst at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. “I would say here you have the Republicans trying to make the systems less regressive.”Related: States have cut money for higher education 17 percent since the recession, report finds For their part, Trump and his campaign have hinted at some positions on higher education, but “he’s been all over the map,” Nassirian said.“We’re going to do refinancing for people who have loans who literally can’t do anything,” Trump told the Washington Examiner in November. He’s also called for shrinking the U.S. Department of Education and ending the federal government’s role in lending directly to college students by returning to a system in which private banks issue federally guaranteed loans to students.A Trump campaign adviser told The Hechinger Report that banks could be allowed to consider students’ majors when issuing loans. Fields such as engineering, with high employment rates and earnings, would get preference over disciplines such as the humanities, which the adviser said result in lower incomes.Related: While federal DREAM Act stalls, some public universities already welcome the undocumentedThat idea is particularly controversial, even among other Republicans. It would “effectively relegate access to liberal arts degrees to the wealthy elite” and “represents a troubling ‘nanny state’ attitude toward young people — as if the government knows better than they do which course of study they should pursue,” Republican Sheila Bair, former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and now president of Washington College in Maryland, wrote in Fortune magazine.The Trump campaign has also proposed putting colleges partially on the hook for former students who don’t earn enough after graduation to repay their loans. Last year, Democrats, including Warren, supported making colleges whose students had high default rates repay a percentage of defaulted loans.“Having the institution have some skin in the game is an issue that is definitely worth looking at,” Foxx said.This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

Mike Pence (R) initially fought against implementing a federal law meant to combat sexual abuse in correctional facilities.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578d1d9b1900001e028a6d31.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump announced Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate last week, it was a nod to the conservative establishment. Pence is a safe bet, a midwesterner who gets along with evangelicals, the tea party and House Speaker Paul Ryan. He’s also a far-right politician with a history of chasing political capital at the expense of groups like LGBT Americans. Lesser known is the time Pence took a stand against a federal law to prevent prison rape. George W. Bush signed the bipartisan Prison Rape Elimination Act, or PREA, in 2003, and the standards were finalized by the Obama administration in 2012. The law aims to combat sexual abuse in correctional facilities through requirements like housing youth separately from adults, firing staff who commit sexual abuse, and granting victims access to medical examinations and emotional support services. Sex abuse in American lockups is not a hypothetical problem. There were over 8,700 allegations of sexual victimization reported by adult correctional facilities in 2011, according to the Justice Department. Only about 10 percent were substantiated, although many incidents go unreported or un-investigated. LGBT inmates are particularly at risk for abuse: More than a third of transgender inmates held in prisons or jails reported at least one incident of sexual victimization in the previous year. In 2014, states and territories were supposed to promise, at a minimum, to work toward compliance with the law. More than 40 states did; Indiana was not among them. In a letter to then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Pence said the standards and timeline “cannot be met,” and claimed “there is little empirical data showing these standards to be effective.” He complained his state would have to hire staff and take other steps that would “require a redirection of millions of tax dollars.” He said Indiana had already taken its own action to change policies in response to PREA, and the Justice Department’s standards worked to “bind the states, and hinder the evolution of even better and safer practices.” He finished his letter by encouraging the administration to “reexamine current expectations” and “provide states greater discretion.” Pence wasn’t the only Republican governor to take a stand against PREA that year. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, then a possible contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, called the requirements “unnecessarily cumbersome.” The underlying political context was clear: Republicans found an opportunity to fight what they perceived to be another example of overreach by the Obama administration. But a Justice Department staffer pointed out at the time that if states refused to comply, under law they would be “held accountable”—primarily by facing financial penalties. In the same way Pence backed changes to his state’s so-called religious freedom law after a national outcry, he appeared to change course on PREA. In July 2014, he brought in “new leadership to coordinate public safety,” and directed a review of these issues, said Kara Brooks, a spokeswoman for Pence, in an email. “One of the resulting policy changes was to become compliant with [PREA],” she said, and in 2015, a letter was sent to the Justice Department indicating Indiana’s intentions. Brooks told HuffPost they are “confident” the state will move toward compliance by the end of the year.When asked by HuffPost why Pence initially tried to defy PREA implementation, Brooks took issue with that characterization. “There were procedural issues with the manner in which DOJ administered the program which made it difficult to have adequate auditors to complete the necessary compliance audits required,” she said. Advocates working on this issue see it differently. “Governors from across the political spectrum stood together to solve prisoner rape; Gov. Mike Pence was not one of them,” said Chris Daley, deputy executive director of Just Detention International, an organization that seeks to end sexual abuse in detention facilities. “By rejecting federal efforts to end sexual abuse in Indiana, Pence put his political career ahead of the safety and wellbeing of thousands of people in his custody.” "

Seventy-two percent of people on the U.S. side of the border and 86 percent along the Mexican side don’t support Donald Trump’s plan to build the barrier, according to a Cronkite News/Univision News/Dallas Morning News survey of people living in 14 U.S. and Mexican cities between California and Texas.A majority of respondents ― 59 percent of those in the U.S. and 69 percent of those living in Mexico ― said the presumptive Republican nominee’s rhetoric is hurting the region surrounding the border.However, there was a major split over trust of law enforcement, a big issue in towns where police presence is high. While 82 percent of respondents in the U.S. said they trust police in their area, 76 percent of those living in Mexico said they don’t trust their local law enforcement.There are a few caveats to keep in mind while looking at the results of the new survey, The Washington Post notes:It interviewed people in seven pairs of U.S.-Mexican “sister cities,” and cities in the United States tend to be more liberal-leaning than rural areas, which could mean residents would be more inclined to oppose a border wall. Most of the cities also have overwhelmingly Hispanic populations — for instance, Nogales, Ariz., is 95 percent Hispanic. That could also affect the results, since Latino Americans tend to have more liberal attitudes on immigration issues.The controversial wall-building plan is a key element of Trump’s campaign, and is set to be included in the Republican Party’s platform this week. Trump has insisted he’ll get Mexico to pay for the construction project, but Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has said there’s “no way” that’s going to happen.Former Mexican presidents have also ridiculed the suggested wall. Vicente Fox tore into the proposal during an interview earlier this year, saying he’s “not going to pay for that fucking wall.”Felipe Calderon has called the plan “stupid.” “Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall,” he said in February. “And it’s going to be completely useless. ... If this guy pretends that closing the borders to anywhere either for trade [or] for people is going to provide prosperity to the United States, he is completely crazy.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Texas, the major immigration case in which the court’s 4-to-4 deadlock effectively left on hold President Barack Obama’s executive actions.In what appears to be a peculiar move, the government said in its petition that it would like the case to be reconsidered “before a full nine-Member Court.”“Ordinarily, it is exceedingly rare for this Court to grant rehearing,” the petition read. “But when this Court has conducted plenary review and then affirmed by vote of an equally divided court because of a vacancy rather than a disqualification, the Court has not infrequently granted rehearing before a full Bench.”In a statement accompanying the petition, the Department of Justice said there’s precedent for this kind of play.“This filing is consistent with historical practice and reflects the need for prompt and definitive resolution of this important case,” said Melanie Newman, a department spokeswoman.Because the court’s tied June decision set no precedent and left in place an injunction blocking the president’s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents — or DAPA ― the administration urged the Supreme Court to grant the petition. Obama’s executive action would have granted a reprieve of deportation and work authorization to parents of U.S. citizens and others who are lawfully in the country.It appears the justices wouldn’t have to act on the request until the court’s ninth member is confirmed. So far, Senate Republicans have showed no intention to hold a hearing or a vote on Merrick Garland, Obama’s choice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.Obama last month called the Supreme Court ruling in the case “heartbreaking” for millions of immigrant families and blamed it on the Senate’s refusal to act to fill the Scalia seat.“This is part of the consequence of the Republican failure so far to give a fair hearing to Mr. Merrick Garland, my nominee to the Supreme Court,” Obama said at the time.Progressive and immigrant-rights groups said DOJ made the right call in seeking another hearing once the court gets a ninth justice.“Last month’s 4-4 tie in the Supreme Court was tremendous blow to millions of immigrant families who are long overdue for relief,” Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, said in a statement. “This case reflects what happens when politicians and members of the judiciary play politics with people’s lives.”Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center ― an organization that has filed legal briefs at different stages in the litigation ― noted the government’s move was “unusual,” but expected given the gridlock in Congress.“Because we have a short-staffed Court unable to issue a decision on the DAPA program, a regional lower court has been able to put unprecedented constraints on the executive and stop a federal policy nationwide, affecting millions of American families,” Wydra said in a statement."

After Turkey completed a comprehensive upgrade of its F-16 jets last year, the head of the country’s air force called the American-made planes “the backbone of our force.”But it’s not unheard of for the jets to be used for purposes other than what Washington imagined ― or might want, as in this case. (The Obama administration condemned the attempted coup.) Last December, Turkey sparked an international incident by using F-16s to shoot down a Russian attack aircraft patrolling the Turkey-Syria border."

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/last-ditch-rebellion-mounted-against-donald-trump_us_578d2d55e4b0c53d5cfa7a56,Former New Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey tried to derail his party's nominee with a desperate vote on rules.,2016-07-18,Virginia delegate Ken Cuccinelli (second from left) and others from Virginia shout during the rules votes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578d4ebf2400002700b31c85.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― Chaos erupted on the floor of the Republican National Convention Monday as fervent opponents of Donald Trump fought and lost an ugly, public rebellion to derail him.New Hampshire delegate Gordon Humphrey, who has been working with the Delegates Unbound and Free the Delegates groups, tried to force party leaders on Monday to approve their rules for the convention on a roll-call vote, rather than a voice vote as is normally done.The idea was that with a public roll call, a majority of delegates might defect.“Donald Trump is so ignorant of anything that he hasn’t a clue what is going on here in general or in detail,” said Humphrey, a former senator who backed Ohio Gov. John Kasich during the primary season.The bid for a roll-call vote failed, but caused an ugly moment in Trump’s march to the nomination.The unrest began when Arkansas Rep. Steve Womack took up the resolution to approve the rules and asked for a voice vote, as the anti-Trumpers lined up behind behind microphones waiting to demand a roll-call vote. Many delegates cried “Aye!” but were soon followed by a roar of “No!” from the crowd. Womack then declared “without objection” that it had passed ― even as delegates from Virginia, Utah and a handful of other states screamed in protest.Virginia delegate Ken Cuccinelli led dozens of his state’s delegates in chanting “point of order” and then “roll-call vote,” as Trump supporters in other states chanted “USA” and “We want Trump.”Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), who was about to officiate the moment, did not take to the podium while the pro- and anti-Trump factions delivered their competing chants.One delegate from Tennessee wearing a Trump button said, “I wish it came down to a fistfight. That would be easier for me.”“I have never seen anything like this. There’s no precedent for this,” Sen. Mike Lee (Utah) told reporters on the floor. “The podium has been abandoned. No one is standing at the podium. I want a roll-call vote.”Humphrey and his cohort nearly got the vote because they had managed to get majorities of nine state delegations to ask for one. The rules required seven states to ask.The Trump campaign and RNC leaders, though, demonstrated the power of holding the gavel. While the stage was empty, RNC officials apparently convinced enough delegates to rescind their demands, leaving just six states seeking the vote.About 20 minutes later Womack reappeared, redid the voice vote, again declared that it had passed, but this time offered the Utah delegation the opportunity to ask for the roll-call vote. He informed them, however, of the delegates who had changed their minds and had withdrawn their support for a roll-call vote ― dropping them below the threshold they needed. “Accordingly, the chair has found insufficient support for a recorded vote,” he said.“That was the plan that was developed over the course of the day,” one top RNC official said on condition of anonymity. Although C-SPAN reported that state delegates from Iowa and Colorado had staged walkouts in the wake of the voice vote, the state pens for Iowa and Colorado were never fully emptied in dramatic fashion.However, a group of delegates did at least try to spark a mass walkout through the time-tested organizing tool of a group text.Eric Minor, a delegate from Washington, which was rumored to be considering a walkout too, told reporters that all the Trump opponents wanted was a vote.“If the roll call failed, we were prepared to be done at that point. I would have thought that was the final nail and we couldn’t go any further. But they didn’t even allow the vote,” he said. “We saw a miscarriage of justice. We saw a party that doesn’t want to seem to operate in a democratic fashion and actually allow votes to be counted.”Meanwhile, Trump indicated he was watching the proceedings. The presumptive nominee was not displeased with the mess on the floor, however, but with CNN, his favorite punching bag. Humphrey had said the roll-call vote would have given him and like-minded Republicans one last chance to empower their fellow delegates to get rid of Trump.“It gives us time to make the case to delegates in recess, one on one and through the news media, that they’re getting screwed, frankly,” Humphrey said. “They’re getting shorn of their manhood and their womanhood. Their right to make their own judgments on any questions are being taking away, and that’s an outrage.”But given the Dump Trumpers’ failure in last week’s Convention Rules Committee, a full roll-call vote was all along almost certain to fail.Free the Delegates leader Kendal Unruh originally hoped to win over the majority of that 112-delegate group to pass a rule allowing the delegates to ignore how their states voted and vote according to their consciences. But with both the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee strongly opposing them, Unruh couldn’t even manage the 28 votes she needed for a “minority report” that at least would have forced a floor vote.Humphrey’s request for a roll-call vote, though, had a slim-to-none chance of passage. He and the other Trump opponents would need a majority of the delegates ― 1,237 ― to agree to reject the rules. Had the anti-Trumpers had that level of support, they would almost certainly have won in the Convention Rules Committee.Still, Humphrey argued that with a little more time and explaining to delegates how they are getting steam-rolled, he had a shot.“I think we would get a majority vote if delegates knew that, but it has not been explained to them,” Humphrey said.Trump is scheduled to be formally nominated as the Republican candidate for president on Tuesday, and is to deliver his acceptance speech on Thursday.This post has been updated with the outcome of the attempt at a roll-call vote and more details from the floor.

Lachlan is more aligned with their father, who thinks that no action should be taken until after the GOP convention this week. Another source confirms that all three are in agreement that Ailes needs to go.After Carlson filed a lawsuit earlier this month claiming Ailes made sexual advances and harassed her during her 11-year tenure at the network, six other women have made similar accusations. Several Fox News stars have defended Ailes, along with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. “This matter is not yet resolved and the review is not concluded,” A 21st Century Fox spokesman said. Fox News referred requests for comment to 21st Century Fox.Given that Ailes created Fox News in his image, it’s hard to imagine the network without him. The former political operative, who advised three Republican presidents, built the conservative cable network into a media powerhouse, with revenue in excess of $1 billion and ratings long exceeding its rivals. Though 76, Ailes has continued to wield power and has not groomed a successor.Over the last year, the Murdoch brothers have been modernizing the media empire built by their father ― with the notable exception of Fox News. Though they had tensions with Ailes, The New York Times reported Sunday they’ve left the network alone because of its continued ratings dominance and because the Fox News CEO “has little interest in corporate oversight.”Rupert, James and Lachlan are having daily conversations about the Ailes issue, according to the Times.“Given the importance of Fox News to the company, the high profile of Mr. Ailes and the seriousness of the allegations,” the paper reported, “the Murdochs want to make sure impartial and thorough consideration is given to the matter."

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-voters-minorities_us_578c0fede4b08608d334f697,A Donald Trump nomination paints Republicans even further into a demographic corner.,2016-07-18,Donald Trump as the Republican nominee is likely taking the Republican Party in the exact opposite direction as was recommended in its 2013 report regarding minority voter outreach.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND – As it officially puts Donald Trump atop its ticket this week, the Grand Old Party is rushing headlong toward an unofficial label it is desperately trying to avoid: the White People’s Party.With his harsh tone toward Mexicans, his proposed ban on Muslims from entering the United States and his seeming tolerance of white nationalist groups, the reality TV star is painting Republicans ever further into a demographic corner that could threaten their viability as a national political organization in the coming decades.“If we don’t expand our ability to reach voters, particularly Hispanic voters, and the rising tide of Asian voters, we’re going to have a generational wipeout,” said Florida’s Rick Wilson, a Republican political consultant and longtime Trump critic.Trump’s language and positions appear to be translating into dismal poll numbers already, particularly in those states where it could matter most. In Florida, a June poll found Trump receiving 20 percent support from Latino voters compared to 68 percent for presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.And in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a Marist College poll for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal released last week actually showed Trump with zero percent support among African-American voters.It wasn’t supposed to be this way at all. Just three years ago, the Republican National Committee published a report detailing the relentless demographic changes the country was undergoing, and how the party’s very existence was at stake if it failed to expand beyond its traditional base.“If we want ethnic minority voters to support Republicans, we have to engage them and show our sincerity,” wrote the authors of the “Growth and Opportunity Project,” giving the example of 2012 nominee Mitt Romney’s poor showing with Latinos. “If Hispanics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies.”Many Latino Republicans are already doing so, thanks to Trump. One California delegate said he tried to give away guest passes to the Cleveland convention to Mexican-American friends – longtime GOP donors from the Los Angeles area – as a way to get more black and brown faces in the Quicken Loans Arena. He was unable to find a single taker, he said, on condition of anonymity to speak freely about his party’s nominee. “Not even one,” he said.But Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said the candidate’s appeal would transcend race and ethnicity. “We think that the message that Donald Trump is talking about ― jobs, security, trying to bring law and order to a community with no preference to any particular ethnic group ― we think those messages will resonate,” he said at a Sunday news conference, and then predicted: “We do think that our Hispanic support is growing. ... I expect to do much better that Romney did in 2012 in the Hispanic community.”Other Republicans remain unpersuaded.One of the authors of that 2013 report, Ari Fleischer, said Trump’s nomination will at least test the validity of their conclusions. “Certainly Donald Trump has gone in the opposite direction from what we recommended,” said the former top aide to President George W. Bush. “If he loses, he’ll give even more credence to our report.”Republicans’ Long, Uneasy History With RaceAt Trump rallies across the country, even in racially diverse communities like San Pedro, California, and Fairfax County, Virginia, black or brown faces are few and far between.At the Iowa State Fair last summer, two middle-aged white men who had just dropped kernels of corn into Trump’s jar at a makeshift straw poll there discussed how important it was to end both illegal and legal immigration because the newcomers’ children would be American citizens ― and by dint of their ethnicity further change this country. (Neither wanted to share his name with a reporter.)At a June Trump campaign event in St. Clairsville, Ohio, 62-year-old Brenda Johnson also railed against immigrants, and explained how much it upset her to hear them speak in other languages. “They should speak English in public,” she said. “It’s fine if they want to speak in their own language at home.”Such attitudes, of course, are not new among voters, and Trump is certainly not the first Republican presidential candidate to use racially tinged language and identity politics.That began in earnest in 1968, when Richard Nixon took advantage of Southern Democrats’ anger over President Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 Civil Rights Act to make inroads into the Deep South. While openly segregationist George Wallace ran a third-party campaign that year and won five of those states, Nixon’s use of the “Southern Strategy” led to what aide Kevin Phillips called “the beginning of a new Republican era” in his 1969 book The Emerging Republican Majority.It was a dramatic reversal for a party that was founded to abolish slavery a century earlier, and which through the first half of the 20th century consistently supported civil rights laws for African-Americans. But from 1968 forward, Republican presidential candidates, to varying degrees, used phrases that appealed to working-class white voters who believed that Democrats were, at the expense of poorer white people, favoring blacks and other minorities.Nixon’s appeal for “law and order,” Ronald Reagan’s story of the Cadillac-driving welfare mom, and George W. Bush’s refusal to condemn South Carolina’s display of the Confederate battle flag from atop its state capitol all spoke to a constituency that delivered Republicans the White House in every election between 1968 and 1988, with the exception of the post-Watergate election in 1976, when former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter won narrowly.But in 1992, California flipped from Republican to Democratic, as Mexican-American voters responded to Republican efforts to crack down on undocumented immigrants. Republicans quickly learned that the “Solid South” no longer gave them a lock on the Electoral College.In the subsequent years, Florida, then Colorado and Virginia, also came into play in presidential elections as their minority populations increased ― to the point where demographics now actually favor a Democrat over a Republican.Ironically, Trump’s racially polarizing candidacy could actually accelerate that shift. North Carolina, which President Barack Obama narrowly won in 2008 but narrowly lost four years later, currently is leaning slightly toward Clinton. Georgia could also wind up closer than the 8-point win for Mitt Romney in 2012, while traditionally red Arizona, with its large Mexican-American population, could actually break for Clinton.As it happens, this was exactly the sort of demographic change the party warned about in its 2013 report. Between 2000 and 2012, the Republican presidential candidate got between 87 and 88 percent of his total votes from white people. But as the electorate has gradually become less white, white votes are no longer enough to win. Only once in the past six elections has the GOP candidate won the popular vote: 2004, when George W. Bush took 43 percent of the Hispanic vote. In the 2012 election, Romney won only 27 percent of that vote. “The nation’s demographic changes add to the urgency of recognizing how precarious our position has become,” the report stated. “According to the Pew Hispanic Center, in 2050, whites will be 47 percent of the country while Hispanics will grow to 29 percent and Asians to 9 percent.”Minority Outreach Undone By TrumpAt the RNC’s meeting in Boston the summer after the 2012 loss to Obama, party Chairman Reince Priebus fairly scolded Romney for suggesting during the primary season that immigrants living in the country illegally should “self-deport.”“Using the word ‘self-deportation’ ― I mean, it’s a horrific comment to make,” Priebus said. “It’s not something that has anything to do with our party. But when a candidate makes those comments, obviously it hurts us.”For party leaders, the need to adapt was not only for the next presidential election, but for the presidential elections in decades to come. Mainstream Republicans got behind a comprehensive immigration overhaul, as the “autopsy” recommended, and watched it pass the Senate only to founder in the House as the party’s disproportionately Southern, disproportionately working-class base revolted.In perhaps the most ominous sign of where things were headed, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R), a co-sponsor of the bill in that chamber, reversed himself and opposed it as he positioned himself for his presidential run.The rejection of the party’s received wisdom was complete when Trump in his announcement speech called undocumented immigrants from Mexico “rapists” (although he allowed that some might be good people) and promised to build a wall along the southern border. In the coming months, he vowed to ban Muslims from entering the United States as a response to terrorist attacks, declined at first to criticize former KKK leader David Duke, and most recently defended the use of an image that resembled the Star of David badge that Nazis forced Jews to wear in Hitler’s Germany before they systematically rounded them up and murdered them.Even this week, when offered the opportunity to speak at the NAACP conference in Cincinnati ― a mere 30 minutes away on his 757 jet ― Trump declined, even though he was afforded the flexibility to speak at the time and day of his choosing. Every recent GOP nominee has spoken at the conference, going back to George W. Bush in 2000.The promise to “take our country back” and “make America great again” appeals to lesser-educated whites who wish for a return to an era when a college degree was not necessary to earn a middle-class living and the population was overwhelmingly white, said Alan Abramowitz, a demographer at Emory University. “He’s trying to appeal to a sense of displacement, a sense of being left out, of being left behind,” he said. “Elect me and we’ll finally have a leader who will undo all these terribles.”Priebus, in the wake of a new poll showing Trump’s overall standing with Latinos down to 14 percent, told Fox News on Sunday that Trump appreciates the need to do better.“I know Donald Trump’s going to be doing a Hispanic engagement tour coming up soon,” Priebus said. “He understands we need to grow the party ― it’s the party of the open door, tone, rhetoric, spirit ― all those things matter when communicating to the American people.”That statement, though, is somewhat of a departure from the party’s typical response since Trump became the presumptive nominee, which is to ignore the Growth and Opportunity Project report and the long-term strategy behind it. Instead, they focus on the tactics for this coming election, and how, despite everything, Trump can still triumph by winning big among white working-class voters in places like Pennsylvania and Ohio and Wisconsin.RNC members and officials, in fact, even insist that Trump will exceed expectations among Latino and African-American voters, his rhetoric to date and current polling notwithstanding.Helen Aguirre Ferre, who took over as head of Hispanic communications after the previous director quit because of her distaste for Trump, said Latino voters are interested in more than just immigration, and that many will be receptive to his message on jobs and national security.Even in her hometown of Miami, where two of the three Cuban-American members of Congress have disavowed Trump, Ferre said Trump has the potential to do well. She pointed to his 22 percent showing in Miami-Dade County, Rubio’s home, in the March 15 primary. “I think that speaks volumes,” she said, adding that Trump’s campaign will work hard to win over those Latino voters in November. “I think they’re waiting to be courted.”And North Carolina’s Ada Fisher, one of only a handful of African-American RNC members, said Trump will exceed expectations with black voters, too. “I think Trump will do quite fine. I think he will do great things,” she said, showing off the “Make America Great Again” hat his campaign had given her. “I’ve been a supporter of Donald Trump since the beginning.”To Florida consultant Wilson, the official party line on Trump ― from the idea that he will do well with minorities to the hope that he can drive up working-class white voter turnout enough to win ― is just plain silly, especially with Trump’s weakness with college-educated white voters and women voters generally.“This is them trying to whistle past the graveyard, pretending like Donald Trump isn’t happening,” he said. “Math is math, it doesn’t negotiate.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-voters-minorities_us_578c0fede4b08608d334f697,A Donald Trump nomination paints Republicans even further into a demographic corner.,2016-07-18,North Carolina RNC member Ada Fisher believes Donald Trump will do well with African-American and Latino voters.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578c13171300002d0005e5ea.jpeg?ops=crop_9_615_2401_2080%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND – As it officially puts Donald Trump atop its ticket this week, the Grand Old Party is rushing headlong toward an unofficial label it is desperately trying to avoid: the White People’s Party.With his harsh tone toward Mexicans, his proposed ban on Muslims from entering the United States and his seeming tolerance of white nationalist groups, the reality TV star is painting Republicans ever further into a demographic corner that could threaten their viability as a national political organization in the coming decades.“If we don’t expand our ability to reach voters, particularly Hispanic voters, and the rising tide of Asian voters, we’re going to have a generational wipeout,” said Florida’s Rick Wilson, a Republican political consultant and longtime Trump critic.Trump’s language and positions appear to be translating into dismal poll numbers already, particularly in those states where it could matter most. In Florida, a June poll found Trump receiving 20 percent support from Latino voters compared to 68 percent for presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.And in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a Marist College poll for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal released last week actually showed Trump with zero percent support among African-American voters.It wasn’t supposed to be this way at all. Just three years ago, the Republican National Committee published a report detailing the relentless demographic changes the country was undergoing, and how the party’s very existence was at stake if it failed to expand beyond its traditional base.“If we want ethnic minority voters to support Republicans, we have to engage them and show our sincerity,” wrote the authors of the “Growth and Opportunity Project,” giving the example of 2012 nominee Mitt Romney’s poor showing with Latinos. “If Hispanics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies.”Many Latino Republicans are already doing so, thanks to Trump. One California delegate said he tried to give away guest passes to the Cleveland convention to Mexican-American friends – longtime GOP donors from the Los Angeles area – as a way to get more black and brown faces in the Quicken Loans Arena. He was unable to find a single taker, he said, on condition of anonymity to speak freely about his party’s nominee. “Not even one,” he said.But Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said the candidate’s appeal would transcend race and ethnicity. “We think that the message that Donald Trump is talking about ― jobs, security, trying to bring law and order to a community with no preference to any particular ethnic group ― we think those messages will resonate,” he said at a Sunday news conference, and then predicted: “We do think that our Hispanic support is growing. ... I expect to do much better that Romney did in 2012 in the Hispanic community.”Other Republicans remain unpersuaded.One of the authors of that 2013 report, Ari Fleischer, said Trump’s nomination will at least test the validity of their conclusions. “Certainly Donald Trump has gone in the opposite direction from what we recommended,” said the former top aide to President George W. Bush. “If he loses, he’ll give even more credence to our report.”Republicans’ Long, Uneasy History With RaceAt Trump rallies across the country, even in racially diverse communities like San Pedro, California, and Fairfax County, Virginia, black or brown faces are few and far between.At the Iowa State Fair last summer, two middle-aged white men who had just dropped kernels of corn into Trump’s jar at a makeshift straw poll there discussed how important it was to end both illegal and legal immigration because the newcomers’ children would be American citizens ― and by dint of their ethnicity further change this country. (Neither wanted to share his name with a reporter.)At a June Trump campaign event in St. Clairsville, Ohio, 62-year-old Brenda Johnson also railed against immigrants, and explained how much it upset her to hear them speak in other languages. “They should speak English in public,” she said. “It’s fine if they want to speak in their own language at home.”Such attitudes, of course, are not new among voters, and Trump is certainly not the first Republican presidential candidate to use racially tinged language and identity politics.That began in earnest in 1968, when Richard Nixon took advantage of Southern Democrats’ anger over President Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 Civil Rights Act to make inroads into the Deep South. While openly segregationist George Wallace ran a third-party campaign that year and won five of those states, Nixon’s use of the “Southern Strategy” led to what aide Kevin Phillips called “the beginning of a new Republican era” in his 1969 book The Emerging Republican Majority.It was a dramatic reversal for a party that was founded to abolish slavery a century earlier, and which through the first half of the 20th century consistently supported civil rights laws for African-Americans. But from 1968 forward, Republican presidential candidates, to varying degrees, used phrases that appealed to working-class white voters who believed that Democrats were, at the expense of poorer white people, favoring blacks and other minorities.Nixon’s appeal for “law and order,” Ronald Reagan’s story of the Cadillac-driving welfare mom, and George W. Bush’s refusal to condemn South Carolina’s display of the Confederate battle flag from atop its state capitol all spoke to a constituency that delivered Republicans the White House in every election between 1968 and 1988, with the exception of the post-Watergate election in 1976, when former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter won narrowly.But in 1992, California flipped from Republican to Democratic, as Mexican-American voters responded to Republican efforts to crack down on undocumented immigrants. Republicans quickly learned that the “Solid South” no longer gave them a lock on the Electoral College.In the subsequent years, Florida, then Colorado and Virginia, also came into play in presidential elections as their minority populations increased ― to the point where demographics now actually favor a Democrat over a Republican.Ironically, Trump’s racially polarizing candidacy could actually accelerate that shift. North Carolina, which President Barack Obama narrowly won in 2008 but narrowly lost four years later, currently is leaning slightly toward Clinton. Georgia could also wind up closer than the 8-point win for Mitt Romney in 2012, while traditionally red Arizona, with its large Mexican-American population, could actually break for Clinton.As it happens, this was exactly the sort of demographic change the party warned about in its 2013 report. Between 2000 and 2012, the Republican presidential candidate got between 87 and 88 percent of his total votes from white people. But as the electorate has gradually become less white, white votes are no longer enough to win. Only once in the past six elections has the GOP candidate won the popular vote: 2004, when George W. Bush took 43 percent of the Hispanic vote. In the 2012 election, Romney won only 27 percent of that vote. “The nation’s demographic changes add to the urgency of recognizing how precarious our position has become,” the report stated. “According to the Pew Hispanic Center, in 2050, whites will be 47 percent of the country while Hispanics will grow to 29 percent and Asians to 9 percent.”Minority Outreach Undone By TrumpAt the RNC’s meeting in Boston the summer after the 2012 loss to Obama, party Chairman Reince Priebus fairly scolded Romney for suggesting during the primary season that immigrants living in the country illegally should “self-deport.”“Using the word ‘self-deportation’ ― I mean, it’s a horrific comment to make,” Priebus said. “It’s not something that has anything to do with our party.

A poll of 11 battleground states released Sunday by CBS and YouGov gave Clinton just a 1-point edge in those contests.HuffPost Pollster’s model, which aggregates all publicly available polls, gives the former secretary of state a lead of just under 4 points nationwide. The results from ABC/Washington Post, which earlier gave Clinton an unusually high 12-point lead, indicate a tightening election. Both the NBC/WSJ and CNN polls, however, suggest that the state of the race has remained largely unchanged since the beginning of summer, despite a spate of stories including FBI Director James Comey’s rebuke of Clinton for her use of a private email server.“The more things change, the more they stay the same,” Peter Hart, whose firm comprises the Democratic half of the NBC/WSJ polling team, told NBC. “Things haven’t changed an awful lot.” His Republican counterpart, Bill McInturff, agreed that the “overall ballot is very stable, and the contours of this election are becoming stable.”The latest round of polling also reiterates how deeply unpopular both Clinton and Trump remain with the electorate. As the Post’s Dan Balz and Scott Clement note, 64 percent of Americans view Trump unfavorably, while 54 percent have negative views of Clinton. Nearly 60 percent say they’re dissatisfied with the choice of Trump versus Clinton.That gives a potential opening to third party candidate like the Libertarian Party’s Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein. When their names are included, CNN/ORC gives Johnson and Stein a combined 18 percent of the vote, with NBC/WSJ giving them a combined 17 percent and ABC/Post finding the third parties at 13 percent.Deciding on how to poll third-party and independent candidates can be tricky ― research finds that, while surveys that don’t include those candidates by name tend to understate their support, those that do include them often overestimate how much backing they’ll receive.“Typically, support for third party candidates fades as the major party tickets are set heading into their conventions. But Johnson’s support outpaces that of a typical third party candidate and may prove to have more staying power,” CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta writes. “One hint that it could fade: Support for both Johnson and Stein appears concentrated among those less enthusiastic about voting this year, suggesting their supporters may be less apt to turn out in the end.”The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters between July 9 and July 13, while the Washington Post/ABC poll surveyed 1,003 adults, including 816 registered voters, between July 11 and July 14, and the CNN/ORC poll surveyed 1,013 adults, including 872 registered voters, between July 13 and July 16. All three used live interviewers to reach both landlines and cell phones."

It’s also provided ample opportunity for internet trolls to engage in some misogyny.After all the chatter and the gender politics, “Ghostbusters” debuted this weekend to a solid $46 million from 3,962 locations. Sony hailed the results as evidence that audiences were responding to its new take on the decades-old property. But though it ranks as the best debut for a live-action comedy in over a year, the film will have to show some endurance, as well as resonate with foreign audiences, to make a profit. After all, dusting off the ectoplasm was expensive, with Sony shelling out $144 million to make “Ghostbusters” and millions more to market the film. That tops what most comedies cost to produce and distribute.Sony has been trying to get another “Ghostbusters” off the ground for decades, but it has often been the victim of original star Bill Murray’s mercurial vetting process. The new picture, which brings together Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones, is clearly designed to trigger a fresh array of sequels.“There absolutely will be more,” said Josh Greenstein, Sony’s marketing and distribution chief. “This is a restart of one of our most important brands.”The audience for the film skewed female, with women making up 54% of ticket buyers. It also resonated more strongly with older crowds, weaned on the 1984 original and its 1989 sequel, as 55% of the audience clocked in over the age of 25. Despite Greenstein’s optimism, some analysts argued the results were underwhelming.“Unless it has massive legs, any opening under $50 million is not a triumph,” said Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “It’s still an asterisk. The next two weeks will tell the tale.”“Ghostbusters” was no match for Illumination and Universal’s “The Secret Life of Pets,” which dominated the box office for a second consecutive weekend, topping all challengers with $50.6 million. The look at what dogs, cats and other domesticated critters do when their owners are at work is one of the summer’s biggest smashes, having earned $203.2 million stateside. It will likely inspire a new family film franchise, and is simply the latest in a long line of hits featuring talking animals.The weekend’s other wide release debut, Broad Green’s “The Infiltrator,” debuted Wednesday across 1,601 theaters, taking in a tepid $6.7 million in its first five days of release. The look at a federal agent’s (Bryan Cranston) attempts to infiltrate drug lord Pablo Escobar’s inner circle scored with critics. The hope is that it will continue to draw adult audiences unmoved by the onslaught of superheroes and sequels. Broad Green declined to comment on the film’s results.In third place, Warner Bros.’ “The Legend of Tarzan” swung to $11.1 million, pushing its domestic total to $103.1 million.Disney’s “Finding Dory” continued to shatter records, bypassing “Shrek 2’s” $441.2 million haul to become the highest-grossing animated release on a domestic basis. The “Finding Nemo” sequel took fourth place with $11 million. Its stateside gross stands at $445.5 million.Rounding out the top five, Fox’s “Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates” picked up $7.5 million, bringing the raunchy comedy’s domestic receipts to $31.3 million.Just in time for the Republican National Convention, conservative director Dinesh D’Souza has struck a chord with far right audiences yet again, releasing “Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party” to a $77,500 opening from just three theaters.In limited release, Amazon Studios scored with “Cafe Society,” Woody Allen’s nostalgic look at 1930’s Hollywood. The comedy, which stars Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg, opened to $355,000 from five locations. That translates to a $71,000 per-screen average, the highest of the year."

But a new survey shows he may be tainting the rest of the Republican Party.A Telemundo/NBC News/WSJ poll of Latinos released Sunday afternoon shows Trump trailing Clinton by 62 points among Latinos in a head-to-head matchup.That’s a significant concern for any presidential candidate hoping to win over an increasingly diverse electorate. Republicans, though, face a bigger worry ― whether Trump’s status as anathema to minorities is likely to rub off on the party as a whole, turning Latino voters further against GOP candidates down the ballot or in future elections.Surveys last year gave them some reason for hope. In a June 2015 survey for Univision, 61 percent of of Hispanic voters said they believed Donald Trump’s comments on Mexican immigrants represented only his view and not the view of the Republican Party. A Gallup survey later that summer found relatively little animosity from Hispanic voters toward any of Trump’s Republican rivals.The latest results, however, paint a dramatically worsening picture for the GOP.Latinos’ already dire opinions of Trump haven’t fallen that much more in recent months. Eighty-two percent view him negatively, up modestly from 75 percent in February. What has changed significantly is their views of the two major parties.Sixty-four percent of Latino voters now hold a negative opinion of the GOP, according to the new poll, up from 48 percent in February. The percentage with a very negative view has risen even more sharply, from 25 percent to a record high 44 percent.In contrast, the percentage of Latino voters with positive views of the Democratic Party has risen from 53 percent to 65 percent, with very positive views more than doubling from 20 percent to 48 percent.It’s never a good idea to read too much into the results of a single survey, especially one, like this, with a relatively small sample size. But if the change it shows is both real and lasting, the effects could ripple past 2016. Republicans have struggled to win over Latino voters long before Trump entered the race ― the party’s 2012 autopsy report warned that “[i]f Hispanics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies.” Latinos, who have traditionally turned out to vote in relatively low numbers, are seeing a boom in voter registration. If this year’s election establishes them as staunch Democrats, it could leave the GOP on the defensive for years to come.“If Hillary Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee, she has this serious opportunity to hit and eclipse the 80 percent mark with Latino voters,” Matt Barreto, a pollster whose firm, Latino Decision, has since joined the Clinton campaign’s polling team, said in a panel discussion last February. “Now, if that happens...I think you are now starting to talk about a more permanent realignment in the Latino vote.”The survey reached 300 Latino registered voters between July 9-13, using live interviewers to call both cell phones and landlines.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S. "

LOUIS - The star of 2016’s Netroots Nation ― the year’s largest gathering of progressive activists and organizations ― wasn’t a Senate candidate, celebrity grassroots crusader or presidential wannabe; it was a 9-year-old named Kennedy who wanted more cheese in her macaroni.As her parents looked on, the precocious activist traipsed about the America’s Center in downtown St. Louis, iPad in hand, asking attendees to sign her petition imploring the makers of Annie’s Mac and Cheese to “make individual cheese packets to buy so we can put more cheese on our macaroni.” The conference’s vegan sympathies aside, the petition was met with near-universal support ― and a lot of grins.Kennedy’s crusade for powdered cheddar was one of the more productive developments at this year’s gathering ― if the gripes of many of Netroots’ attendees are any indication. In interviews with The Huffington Post, many activists and politicians gathered in St. Louis expressed the hope that Netroots would leverage its unparalleled collection of influential progressive figures and organizations to rally around a set of candidates and issues ahead of the Democratic National Committee in Philadelphia.However, they were sorely disappointed by how the convention unfolded.Whereas previous Netroots Nations featured keynote speakers like Barack Obama, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, this year’s keynote slots were given over to often unfocused and generally less-attention grabbing debates about progressive movements. One keynote was titled “The Digital CultureSHIFT: Moving from Scale to Power to Achieve Racial Justice” and another, “Climate Justice Strategies: Exploring the Intersections of Climate Change.” These events, while not without compelling discussions, were at best overly granular and at worst circular liberal firing squads. During one keynote on the Black Lives Matter movement, a panelist declared that Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton were “as much of the enemy as Donald Trump is.”There are few things liberals love more than squabbling while wearing lanyards. It’s a year-round phenomenon, witnessed at untold numbers of Center for American Progress panels, progressive bootcamps and any major gathering of the country’s change agents. For years, Netroots distinguished itself by not only providing activists a venue to talk about intersectionality and call each other “rock stars,” but also serving to marshall the left behind leading figures in the Democratic party and progressive movements.“We have some great stars and stars in the making in the progressive movement, but it would be wonderful to have a platform to introduce them to the community and really catapult them into the national spotlight,” lamented one leading progressive activist. “CPAC has been good in the past at using the main stage and making stars,” the activist added, referencing the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, which often serves a springboard for aspiring right wing politicians.Indeed, many attendees wished that Netroots would more closely resemble the conservative conference by emphasizing elections and legislation.“I disagree with CPAC’s ideology entirely, but CPAC shows what a hard-hitting convention can be,” said Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.), who is running in the Democratic primary for the Senate. “There’s a great deal of attention given to identity politics [at Netroots] and much less attention to progressive values, how to win elections, how to excite the grassroots and our ideology.”“One of the things we’ve always [found] most valuable about Netroots Nation has been the opportunities to have face-to-face meetings with a huge array of people we might work with,” said the activist. “If you have a declining attendance, or you don’t have the decision makers in the room, that takes away some of the value of attendance.”Timing wasn’t Netroots’ friend this year, as the conference fell only a week and a half before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where many of the same individuals and organizations will be present.“The number one resource of any campaign is the candidate’s time,” said a Democratic Party official. “In election years, candidates only have so much time to spend on liberal lovefests ― and they’re going to another one in 16 days where they will see many of the same people.”Indeed, this year’s Netroots Nation featured a paucity of A-list Democratic lawmakers. Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Reps. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Mark Takano (D-Calif.) and Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) appeared on panels, but only Ellison was giving a prime speaking slot, despite hailing from one of the most Democratic-leaning districts in the country. Compounding matters was anxiety about the audience ― which last year famously booed presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley over their civil rights records ― but still placed most of the blame on the timing.“I do think last year scared people away but there’s also some unusual dynamics this year with the Philly convention just around the corner and a lot of politicians not wanting to get in the middle of a conference with a lot of Bernie people still not reconciled to Hillary,” said one senior Democratic operative at the convention. “I had one politician say to me they didn’t want to get booed for saying nice things about Hillary.”Raven Brooks, the executive director of Netroots Nation, said the decision to shift the conference’s focus from individual politicians to progressive movements and community change was intentional and necessary, and cited the need, with the Democratic primary winding down, to have “intra-progressive conversations.”“We wanted to focus on empowering and elevating activists this year,” Brooks said. But with fewer major names on the agenda, many activists say both the draw and impact of Netroots is greatly diminished.“Netroots should be a place where people come to make news and powerful people come to get questions that their normal daily life doesn’t expose them to,” said another leading activist. “The prominent folks, from elected officials down to staff, have higher priorities this year,” said one Democratic operative. “it’s just not a must-go event anymore for folks.”The person added, “If someone wants to pay for me to go, sweet, it’ll be interesting, I guess, but otherwise, I don’t feel a huge need to be there nowadays.” ―-CORRECTION: The article has been updated to reflect that Rep. Keith Ellison appeared on the main Netroots Nation stage. "

But, thinking the two were up to no good, he stepped in front of the car and ordered them not to move.When the driver accelerated the car toward him, he jumped out of the way and “discharged his handgun several times at the vehicle,” per the sheriff’s office statement. The teens sped off and the homeowner called deputies, who arrived to interview him. A search for the vehicle proved fruitless, until 10:30 a.m., when the 19-year-old’s mother called police after noticing the vehicle had bullet holes in the hubcap, fender and rear tire.“Since they were not injured and there was no (apparent) damage to the vehicle, they thought it was someone trying to scare them and this is why they did not contact law enforcement or tell their parents,” the sheriff’s office statement added.Deputies are still investigating the incident, and offered a series of safety tips for people playing the augmented reality game that has swept across the world in the last week. They included using common sense and being alert at all times, and not trespassing or playing the game while driving, biking or skateboarding."

LOUIS ― With presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton set to announce her running mate in the coming week, many progressive activists and lawmakers fret that her choice may undo much of the work her campaign has done to court the party’s left wing. At this weekend’s annual Netroots Nation conference, the year’s largest gathering of progressive activists, a number of attendees expressed concern that a more moderate choice ― such as Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who is widely considered the leading candidate ― would suppress turnout and engagement. Asked about a Clinton/Kaine ticket, Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.), who is running in his state’s Democratic Senate primary, let out a disdainful chuckle. “What can I say? I worry he’s well to the right of the mainstream Democratic Party,” he said. Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a prominent liberal advocacy group, contended that a Democratic ticket with a moderate vice presidential candidate could hinder Clinton’s campaign operation. “An energizing vice presidential pick will get millions of people to not just vote, but volunteer and give money,” Green said, “as opposed to merely showing up on election day.”Many Netroots attendees expressed hope that Clinton would name Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), citing Warren’s stance on a number of issues and her popularity. “I think it signals the direction of the party,” said Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who was the only member of the Senate to endorse Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign, of a more liberal running mate. “It would very much capture a lot of momentum for progressive issues.” Merkley, who many attendees floated as a potential running mate, added that he would also be pleased if Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) or Sanders were tapped as Clinton’s number two. Merkley declined to comment on anxiety about Kaine, only to say that the Virginia senator is “very capable.” “I think most progressives would love to see Elizabeth Warren,” said Grayson. “There’s an obvious warmth that people feel toward Elizabeth Warren that isn’t duplicated by any other Democratic figure. People feel that they can believe in her, which is very important in motivating our folks to vote.”The Clinton campaign, for its part, has made a concerted effort to court the party’s progressive wing, both during the primary and after Sanders dropped out earlier this week. The campaign had multiple representatives at Netroots, appearing on panels dedicated to advancing progressive agendas. Many attendees spoke favorably of Clinton’s recent expansion of her proposal to reduce college debt to provide free tuition to working-class families. And, in a video message aired at Netroots, Clinton said she would introduce a constitutional amendment early in her administration to undo the Citizens United ruling that opened the door for today’s anything-goes campaign finance regime. “I think the campaign has responded responsibly,” Grayson said. Kaine, for his part, has been emphasizing the progressive aspects of his record on some issues of particular import to the party’s left flank. In an interview with CNN, Kaine said he is “a strong supporter of Roe v. Wade,” likely a reference to his past remarks that he personally opposes abortion. Many abortion rights proponents have expressed concern over his stance on the issue. Despite the rapprochement between the Clinton campaign and progressive activists, many in the party’s base, in particular Sanders supporters, remains deeply skeptical of Clinton’s move to the left and her vice presidential pick. In a press release, a group of Sanders delegates released the findings of a survey of 250 Sanders-supporting delegates, saying a majority would “Nonviolently and emphatically [protest] in the convention hall during Clinton’s acceptance speech” if Clinton picked a running mate that didn’t support a liberal enough agenda. “Can any Democratic presidential candidate afford to do without solid support from this base in a general election?” Karen Bernal, a delegate from Sacramento, said in the group’s statement. “That is the question Secretary Clinton and her advisers should think long and hard about.” "

It’s all about finding your purpose, which is what the singer’s apparently been doing since releasing his latest album, aptly titled “Purpose.”“Take this moment to listen and try not to give me a hat or whatever you’re trying to throw onto the stage right now, because I probably don’t want that shit,” he said in a video recorded by a fan at the show. The crowd of Beliebers erupted into cheers before Bieber apologized for his choice of words. “Sorry, that was mean,” he said. The cheering seemingly flustered the pop star, causing him to lose his train of thought. “I was deep into, like, a mode and a zone. I was into it. Now I’m out of it. I’ll get it back. Just give me a second,” he said, before pausing.He continued:“I just wanted to take this moment to acknowledge the fact that we all have a purpose, that we all have a meaning to life and it’s not, like, we just don’t live to die,” he said. “And this life is not all struggles. I know that sometimes when we wake up in the morning, and it’s like ‘God, another day...’”Before breaking into his song “Purpose,” the Canadian singer apologized for throwing a fan’s hat ― the incident that likely spurred his interlude. “Sorry for throwing you hat, but you ruined the moment,” he said. “Whatever, let’s do it.” "

As a result, counter-ISIL coalition air operations at all air bases in Turkey have resumed,” a Pentagon statement said.Turkey, a major U.S. ally, has allowed the United States to use the air base in Incirlik to launch attacks against the militant group. Those air operations were temporarily halted following the coup attempt on Friday.Secretary of State John Kerry said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he had spoken with Turkey’s foreign minister three times on Saturday.“They assure me that there will be no interruption of our counter-ISIL efforts,” Kerry said, using an acronym to refer to the Islamic State.Kerry said that the difficulty for U.S. planes accessing Incirlik may have been a result of planes flown in support of the coup using the air base to refuel.On NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Kerry was asked if Turkey’s president Tayyip Erdogan would use the coup attempt to seize more power.Kerry said such a move by Erdogan would be a challenge to his relationship with Europe, with NATO and others.“We have urged them not to reach out so far that they are creating doubts about their commitment to the democratic process,” he said.Erdogan has blamed his rival, Fethullah Gulen, for masterminding the coup attempt. Gulen, who is currently living in Pennsylvania, has denied any involvement.Kerry said he had no evidence at this time that Gulen was behind the plot to seize power from Erdogan, but he urged Turkish authorities to compile evidence as rapidly as possible so the United States can evaluate whether Gulen should be extradited to Turkey.In an interview from Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, Gulen told reporters he did not know who was behind the attempted coup and suggested it might have been staged by Erdogan’s government to seize more control.“This is not the pattern of an attempted coup,” Gulen said through an interpreter."

I don’t know whether they will push them back or it will stay like this,” Malahifji said.A local rebel command center warned people not to use the road after several residents trying to flee in minibuses and cars came under fire from pro-government forces, rebels said.“ALL-OUT OFFENSIVE”Sixteen rebel fighters were killed in the clashes around the Castello Road and nearby districts on Sunday, Syrian state media and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

(AP Photo/Claude Paris)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"July 17 (Reuters) - A California university student who has been missing since Thursday’s Bastille Day attack in Nice is among those who died after a truck driver deliberately plowed through a crowd, killing at least 84 people, University of California, Berkeley, said on Sunday.Nicolas Leslie, 20, was one of 85 Berkeley students on a 15-day study-abroad trip on entrepreneurship in Europe. Three other students were injured in the attack.“This is tragic, devastating news,” UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks said in a statement released Sunday. “All of us in the UC Berkeley family - both here on campus, and around the world - are heartbroken to learn that another promising young student has been lost to senseless violence.”Leslie was a junior in the university’s Natural Resources department who planned to go on to business school, Dirks said. He was one of 85 Berkeley students attending a 15-day course on European entrepreneurship and innovation held in Nice, the university said.Of the three students who were wounded in the attack, two have been released after medical treatment. Vladyslav Kostiuk, 23 and Diane Huang, 20, continue to study at the program, the university said in the statement.A third, Daryus Medora, 21, remains in the hospital, the university said.Leslie’s death marks the second time in less than a month that a Berkeley student died in attacks by militants abroad. Two weeks ago, 18-year-old sophomore Tarishi Jain died when militants attacked a cafe in Dhaka, killing 20.The radical Islamist group Islamic State has claimed the Nice attack, calling the driver, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, one of its soldiers. But authorities have yet to produce evidence that the 31-year-old had any actual links to the militant group.Bouhlel was shot dead at the scene of the attack.During a visit to Nice on Sunday, French Health Minister Marisol Touraine said 18 people, including a child, were still in a critical condition, while about 85 people in total were in hospital.A Texan and his 11-year-old son on a family vacation were also among at least 84 people killed in the July 14 attack.(Reporting by Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento, Calif.; Editing by Peter Cooney and Alan Crosby)"
