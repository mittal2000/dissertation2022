One day you hear a report that drinking coffee is good; the next day a new study claims that drinking coffee will lead to a heart attack. Is pasta okay to eat, or is it the enemy? I get frustrated, and I'm sure you do, too. Who do you believe? Many patients have told me they thought fat-free was healthy, only to later learn that fat-free products are often loaded with sugar. Or they start eating yogurt as part of their goal to start the day with a healthy breakfast; then they find out that their brand of yogurt has as much sugar as a candy bar. When I was researching my book, AARP New American Diet, I had a lot of these questions in mind. In order to cut through the clutter, I relied heavily on the most recent and comprehensive clinical studies from two of the most respected names in health: the National Institutes of Health and AARP. Many of the studies you've heard on what people have done to live a longer and healthier life have come out of this lengthy study.

Paris has grappled with the tradition almost as much as Rome has. Joel Retailleau, a city official in the 6th arrondissement (where the famous Pont des Arts sits), recently told the Wall Street Journal: ""It's very touchy to attack the phenomenon—because it draws tourists."" A spokesman for the mayor told the paper: ""The city's reputation as a capital for lovers draws on its history, its beauty and many other qualities that aren't linked to this recent trend...We don't encourage it, but we don't outlaw it, either."" Both the Pont des Arts and the Pont de l'Archevêché have become the go-to destinations for visitors to attach their locks; so much so that souvenir peddlers sell personalized padlocks for around 20 Euros. For those looking to continue the trend, look no further than these places around the world that honor one of the sillier romantic traditions. "

Public perceptions about crowds, long lines and ""kiddie"" experiences cause many adults to dismiss it out of hand as a romantic travel destination. Despite this, Walt Disney World is a popular destination for honeymooners. There is actually a whole ""vacation kingdom"" of experiences at Walt Disney World outside the confines of the Magic Kingdom. Here are some tips to help you make the most of a honeymoon trip to Walt Disney World.The first recommendation is finding a hotel that has a more adult theme. While the oversized, animated icons of the Disney value resorts are nice for families with kids, there's absolutely nothing romantic about the view of a giant Buzz Lightyear out your hotel window. (Unless you have an odd thing for Buzz Lightyear.) A more romantic hotel does require spending more money (Disney regularly offers discounts, so do your homework if you're visiting Walt Disney World on a budget), and there are both Disney-owned and non-Disney owned options for hotels. I recommend an Epcot-area hotel. Disney's BoardWalk Inn and Disney's Beach & Yacht Club are the Disney-owned options there, or there's the third-party Swan and Dolphin Resorts. Each of these hotels has great options for dining and entertainment, and all are a short walk or boat ride to Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios. While the Magic Kingdom is the park in which families will find themselves spending the most time, Epcot is the park honeymooners will most enjoy. Its World Showcase area contains excellent dining, entertainment and the opportunity for adult fun like drinking around the world.Speaking of dining, despite the stereotype about theme park food, there are actually a myriad of fine dining options in Walt Disney World. Most of these better restaurants are in the hotels rather than the theme parks. Purchasing a Disney Dining Plan can be a great hassle-free way to experience these nicer restaurants and potentially save money in the process! Favorites here include Yachtsman Steakhouse, which features an open-air kitchen and butcher room, Jiko, which has one of the largest selections of South African wines in the United States, and California Grill, which offers award-winning California fusion cuisine along with breathtaking views of Walt Disney World. The absolute can't-miss for honeymooners is the AAA five-diamond winning Victoria & Albert's, which doesn't even permit children. Of course, these aren't the only choices for romantic dining at Walt Disney World. In addition to enjoying a luxurious hotel and fine dining, there are a variety of in-park experiences that are more adult-oriented. Besides the aforementioned World Showcase in Epcot, there are a variety of quiet nature trails at Disney's Animal Kingdom, and plenty of theatrical shows around the parks that feature stunning art and incredible performances. These shows are a great alternative to the mild thrills and long waits offered by Disney's relatively tame coasters and ""adult"" rides. With the exception of thrill rides, attractions geared towards adults generally have shorter waits, too!There are also ample opportunities for add-on experiences and tours if you want a more romantic honeymoon. Some of these can be pricey (it should come as no surprise that the place where every ride exits into a gift shop has found new ways to get more of your money!), like the Wild Africa Trek, but some can be very inexpensive, like the Behind the Seeds Tour at Epcot. While not romantic, per se, they are more adult experiences that will definitely make the trip feel more refined. Many visitors to Walt Disney World are unaware of these experiences, and simply assume the only things for them to do are the attractions they see in the parks. Other separately ticketed shows outside of the theme parks, like Cirque du Soleil, can offer the perfect conclusion to a night at Walt Disney World. As far as other nightlife goes, Walt Disney World does not have the same caliber of dance clubs that you'd find in a major city, but it has plenty of themed experiences and bars. Some favorites include the dueling piano bar, Jellyrolls and the Raglan Road Irish Pub. There are bars and lounges at just about every Disney hotel, but it's often best to head to one of the more highly regarded bars for a better experience. In general, there are a variety of options for adults honeymooning at Walt Disney World. Not all of them are heavily advertised or as prominent around the resort as, say, Mickey Mouse, but there are numerous things for adults to do at Walt Disney World, nonetheless. And, there's nothing wrong with letting loose, embracing your inner child, and getting some photos with Mickey Mouse and his friends. You are in the Mouse House, after all!"

One in every 88 kids today is being diagnosed with autism. There are kids with autism on TV shows, kids with autism in the news, kids with autism in your kid's classroom. It's safe to say Americans know that autism exists.But that doesn't mean they know the first thing about the spectrum disorder. This is the next hurdle for parents of kids on the autism spectrum: breaking down the myths that follow their kids everywhere they go. Think you know better? Test your knowledge with these autism myths:1. Moms of kids on the spectrum are ""Refrigerator Moms."" The term comes from the '50s, when there was an assumption that autistic behaviors stem from the ""emotional frigidity"" of a child's mom, and it's a complete myth. As Erin Mast, committee chair of the Central NY Community of Autism Speaks and mom behind A Million Pieces for Autism, says, ""I am NOT a refrigerator mom. I loved my kids from birth and continue to love them today.""2. Kids with autism have no empathy. ""This is not the issue,"" says Shannon Rosa, editor of Thinking Person's Guide to Autism and mom of a boy with autism. ""The issue is generally processing social signals and body language. Autistic people are often more empathetic than non-autistics, plus have fewer filters to protect themselves from other people's emotional states.""3. Kids with autism need to be taught to make eye contact. ""Um, no!"" Rosa says. ""Eye contact is physically painful for many autistics. Others can either make eye contact or talk, but not both at the same time. Responses come in many forms, other folks need to learn to respect that. If I ask my son a question, and he responds verbally, that's good enough for me.""4. Kids on the spectrum are just like Dustin Hoffman's character in the movie ""Rain Man."" ""Everyone assumes that all people with autism have savant skills, especially memory-type things,"" Mast explains. ""That is not the case. Like any human being, each person has skills that they are better at than others, but not all have a savant skill.""5. Non-speaking autistics always have an intellectual disability. Not true, says Rosa. ""Many autistics communicate by typing, by AAC (alternative and augmentative communication), etc. Having written that, I don't pine away waiting for my mostly non-speaking son to suddenly start typing his thoughts to me. If he did, that would be great (especially for him!). But I love him for who he is right now.""6. Children with autism can't stand to be touched. Not true at all, says Leigh Merryday, mom of a child with autism and blogger at Flappiness Is. Need more proof than that? Just check out the pictures of her hugging little Callum on her blog where she describes him as ""quite a friendly and affectionate little guy.""7. There is an autism ""epidemic."" Sure, the numbers are up, but this is a big no, Rosa says. ""First, autism is not a disease. Secondly, due to changes in diagnostic criteria, most of the children diagnosed with autism today would have different diagnoses 20 years ago. If there's any crisis, it is one of underdiagnosis, as that infamous '1 in 88' CDC study revealed.""8. Kids with autism have no sense of humor. These moms will tell you the exact opposite. As Rosa says of son Leo, he ""is a gleeful imp.""9. Children with autism don't feel love. Another one that gets under Merryday's skin because it's absolutely untrue. A New York Times feature on a couple -- both with autism -- falling in love did a lot to break down this stigma.10. Children with autism are mentally retarded. If they're not being labeled savants, it's the exact opposite, Merryday has found. But when researchers took a long, hard look at the long-standing assumption that kids with autism suffer from mental retardation, they found it was far from the truth. Some kids on the spectrum are harder to test than others, but that doesn't mean they are lacking in intelligence.What autism myths bother you?More from The Stir:Mommy Talk Decoded: What Those Momisms REALLY Mean Parents Control Son's Autistic Rages With Pot 10 Things Your Baby Doesn't Care About (So You Shouldn't Either) 9 Rules Moms Should Follow at the Playground 5 'Blizzard Babies' Whose Birth Stories Are Impossible to Forget"

Thomas Jefferson University researchers explained in a Birth Defects Research study what exactly the synovial joint is: Synovial joints are elegant, critically important, and deceptively simple biomechanical structures. They are comprised of articular cartilage that covers each end of the opposing skeletal elements, synovial fluid that lubricates and nourishes the tissues, ligaments that hold the skeletal elements in check, and a fibrous capsule that insulates the joints from surrounding tissues.Lady Gaga did not specify which parts of her body were experiencing the joint inflammation, though she noted that she is unable to walk right now because of the condition. Synovitis leads to swelling of the joint, which causes feelings of tenderness, the Hospital for Special Surgery reported. According to the Hemophilia, von Willebrand Disease & Platelet Disorders Handbook, the membrane swells because of repeated joint bleeds. It's treated in a number of different ways, including physical therapy, medications and surgery. "

While some of it is banal, some of it is truly exciting. For example, this week started out with a collaboration I designed with Phillip Lim for his fall/winter 2013 runway show, which showed on Monday. Then, last night at 9:20 p.m., I was coming home from a funeral service for a distant friend who died from the flu at age 37. (Crazy right?) I was in a mood of ""What's it all about, Alfie"" when I started to receive a string of texts from friends that Michelle Obama was wearing my pin at the State of the Union address. I was somewhere between being excited about Michelle and feeling sad about my friend. It's funny how you can never predict events and what will go on in any given day.I started to be swept up in the excitement of Michelle wearing my pin. It's the second time that she has worn my designs for a SOTU address. I do not have a TV hooked up to cable, so I was in the dark -- literally -- on what she was wearing. I started asking friends to text me an image so I could actually see which piece it was. The image finally came through: a hand-sculpted, grey lucite flower brooch studded with pearls and crystals, pinned to her shoulder on a Jason Wu dress.There is something about Michelle Obama -- the person, the president's wife, the first African American first lady -- and her sheer elegance, which all culminates into a perfect storm of a force to be reckoned with. One that you want to be a part of. She is a powerful symbol for women and our country and sign of where America is going. It's especially moving for me because I still produce my work in Brooklyn. My company is one of the remaining 5 percent of fashion still produced in the U.S., which is truly a challenge to persevere competitively in the market place. But I felt proud of all my staff, who ""touch"" each part of the process to make it possible to create the jewelry. Last night, they were all represented in that pin.When I finally got snuggled into my bed with my dog Habibi and my cat Winnie and reflected on the day's rollercoaster of events, I thought to myself, at the end of the day, life goes by so quickly. But, I want to be a part of the energy... crazy or not. If last night has taught me anything, it's that life is fleeting, so you have to try and remain in the moment and enjoy every second of it.PHOTOS:See more FLOTUS fashion!Want more?

It's just that most people believe that waiting until they're three or four or five is a long time, because amblyopia is set in,"" said Dr. Susannah Longmuir, an ophthalmologist who led the new study at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.""Finding it early is generally believed to be better,"" she told Reuters Health.However, not all researchers and policymakers agree screening very young kids for vision problems is definitely worthwhile.The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed panel, recommended in 2011 that kids age three to five be screened at least once for lazy eye.But for babies and toddlers under three years old, the panel said there wasn't enough evidence to weigh the possible benefits and harms of vision screening.Dr. Michael LeFevre, co-vice chair of the USPSTF and a family doctor at the University of Missouri School of Medicine in Columbia, said the new study doesn't change that.""The principal research gap really related to after one identifies abnormalities, whether treatment affects the development of amblyopia,"" LeFevre, who wasn't involved in the new research, told Reuters Health.""We had evidence that treatment in the three- to five-year age range prevents long term vision loss, but we didn't have any evidence in the younger age range.""A PATCH AT TWO?Treatment for lazy eye - when one eye loses the ability to see details - usually involves covering up the good eye or making it blurry with drops so the child is forced to use the bad eye instead. Sometimes, children with amblyopia also need glasses to improve their vision.""You can imagine taking your two-year-old and having them run around with a patch on their eye, how easy it is,"" LeFevre said. ""It's hard enough at age three to five.""For the new study, Longmuir and her colleagues analyzed the records of more than 200,000 Iowa preschoolers who were screened for signs of lazy eye between 2000 and 2011. One-fifth of those kids were younger than three years at the time of testing.Among babies less than one year old, a quarter of screening tests were unreadable, the researchers found. But when they compared one- and two-year-olds only with the older preschoolers, there was no difference in screening accuracy, according to findings published Monday in Pediatrics.Between three and five percent of kids were referred to an ophthalmologist for further testing and treatment, based on the free screening.Doctors confirmed that as many as 90 percent of those positive screeners needed treatment.Some states offer free vision screening for toddlers, but the idea of eye checks in that age group is ""a very debatable topic"" given the resources involved, according to Longmuir.Still, she and her colleagues said parents should take advantage of those programs where they exist - even if their child is younger than three years old.""If the opportunity exists, go ahead and do it,"" Longmuir said.SOURCE: bit.ly/X5dOFk Pediatrics, online February 11, 2013.Copyright 2012 Thomson Reuters.

About a year ago, the New York Times discovered that pods for single-serve coffee machines cost about five times as much as normal coffee beans, on a per-pound basis. Consumer Reports has found that using pod coffee makers can cost hundreds of dollars more per year than non-pod competitors, unless you use a refillable pod that basically defeats the whole point of the machines.Single-serve coffee has nonetheless become incredibly popular very fast; it already commands an 8 percent share of the overall global coffee market. Industry insiders generally believe that this is because consumers compare the cost of a coffee pod -- generally about a quarter -- to the cost of a cup of brewed coffee purchased somewhere like Starbucks or even a deli, and find that they're still saving a lot of money by staying home. And there's really no denying that single-serve coffeemakers are easier to use than bigger drip machines (much less methods, like AeroPress and Chemex, considered nonpareil by true Joe aficionados.)But now, Bloomberg reports that Nespresso is testing consumers' willingness to spend big bucks for coffee made at home with an incredibly pricy new kind of coffee for its machines.

We're quite honestly waiting for Carnival to get here because this isn't their first rodeo; it really is the first or maybe second time we've had a distressed ship come to our port.""HPT: What happens when the ship arrives?DR: ""The main objective is to get these people home. Our wish would be for all 3,000 passengers to spend the night and fly out of our airport -- boy, would that be a real shot in the arm -- but Carnival is going to bus some to New Orleans, fly them out of Mobile or get them back to Galveston [the port from which the cruise left].""HPT: If passengers did stick around, what would they find in Mobile?DR: ""The last two weeks have been Mardi Gras down here -- Mardi Gras actually started in Mobile, Alabama -- and we've had over 30 parades and close to a million visitors. So even though there are a lot of tired hospitality people here, a couple of the downtown attractions have already started brainstorming 'show your boarding pass' offers to extend their hospitality. The restaurants will be geared up downtown as will the Mobile Museum and the Mobile Carnival Museum. The shopping, the Gulf Coast Exploreum, the USS Alabama are all within less than five miles of the cruise terminal.""HPT: What does this experience mean for the future of cruising in Alabama?DR: ""Presently we do not have a ship. We had Carnival Cruise Lines here for seven years, and about a year ago, they made a business decision to take that ship and move it over to New Orleans. So we've been in active conversations with numerous cruise lines to bring a ship back to Mobile. It means a lot to the economy. It means a lot to Mobile to get a cruise ship back. There are good signs that we will have a cruise ship in the future.""Several answers were edited or condensed for clarity."
