(Photo by Michael Buckner/Getty Images for Entertainment Weekly)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb431762400003200560313.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, is the man to talk to when you want Marvel news. He's the one who calls the shots. At Saturday night's Marvel Comic-Con panel in Hall H, Feige was on hand to show new footage from ""Thor: The Dark World,"" ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" He also brought Joss Whedon out to unveil the title of the new Avengers movie, ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron.""But, what about all of the other rumors swirling? What about ""Doctor Strange""? Where is all this talk about Vin Diesel leading? What are the two mystery Phase 3 movies that have yet to be announced? Shortly before the Hall H panel, I met with Kevin Feige at his hotel here in San Diego and asked him about all of these things.The thing that I appreciate about you is that you're often coy about not giving secrets away, but you don't lie. No. I'm not interested in being caught in a lie. There's usually not a reason to -- and the end game is opening weekend. Everything is about opening weekend. Not for the box office -- of course we need that -- but for the experience. So, every time I'm being coy, it's being coy for the benefit of the reveal or the benefit of the experience. But if somebody calls you on something -- I don't want to be sitting there and someone goes, ""I remember you lied to me!"" So, why do that?Vin Diesel's name keeps circulating as being in ""something"" Marvel related. I just picture you staring at the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise thinking, I'd like a piece of that. Well, here's what I will tell you about Vin. And I'll be very honest with you. We did a press day on the ""Captain America"" set last week or something. The very first question was, ""So how did the meeting with Vin Diesel go?"" I went, ""Here's the funny thing, it hasn't happened yet. It happens at 3 p.m. today."" And they went, ""Oh, really?"" And it did and he came by and met. So, I'll say two things: One, there's nothing to announce with Vin. Vin is an amazing guy and an amazing personality.Could an announcement come at D23? No. It's so far ahead it may not even exist. So, there's nothing to announce. But, I love Vin and he's an amazing personality. Look how much attention he's gotten for a meeting. He's incredibly shrewd. He's got a Riddick movie that I can't wait to see. And the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise, in addition to Vin, is a franchise I admire a lot for turning the sixth and next year the seventh into the biggest and most popular one. As far as a piece of it? Could someday we do a ""Luke Cage: Hero for Hire"" in that kind of vein. Totally.How much power do you have over the Marvel entities at Sony and Fox? Bryan Singer is using Quicksilver for ""X-Men"" and Joss Whedon is using another version of Quicksilver for the next ""Avengers."" You don't have the power to mediate that? Nope. The contracts are very specific and sometimes very old. How does Quicksilver fall through to both? Is it some sort of technicality? He's one of the few characters that has a legitimate claim to two different teams. When the contracts are written out, is there a list of every character that can be used? It's evolved over the years. They have gotten much more specific over the years as Marvel and Fox and Sony hone down --- and, certainly, when Marvel began making our own movies, the other studios went, ""Wait a minute. Who has what?"" And we started being very specific about hundreds and hundreds of characters and where they belong. Quicksilver is one of those characters -- and there are only a handful of them that have a legitimate claim to multiple comic families. And that's how they end up on a non-exclusive list.""Doctor Strange"" has been tossed around as a possible Phase 3 movie. What do you like about that character? Two things. One, he is a great individual singular character. He's got a great personality. He's got a great origin story. And he's very, very different than any of our other characters. And, you know, we could find a great, great actor to bring that role to life. And a lot of people have been calling us, for years, about that. And he is a section of the Marvel universe -- like ""Guardians,"" is cosmic, and Thor and The Avengers sort of tease into that cosmic realm. He deals with other dimensions and he deals with the supernatural side of the Marvel universe -- which is extensive. And which we haven't dealt with at all in the Marvel cinematic universe. And arguably only in ""Blade"" -- and ""Ghost Rider,"" I guess -- touched on some of that stuff. So, to me, Doctor Strange is an in to a whole other corner of the Marvel universe that we haven't brought to life in movies yet.I've interviewed you before and you do a lot of press. But, who are you? [Laughs] Is this my therapy session?You've become this famous guy in your own right that we ask spoiler-type questions to. There's not many people in the position you're in that are as well known. Really? Because the The New York Times just called me ""invisible.""I feel that you're around a lot. I think in a segment of the press -- in which you are one -- that's the case. I think if you go outside that at all, that is not the case at all. You're almost like you're own Marvel character now. [Laughs] No.You're calling the shots. If people know how to pronounce my last name, I'm amazed and flattered. So there are two mystery Phase 3 movie slots still out there. Yes.Everyone assumes one is ""Doctor Strange."" So, for the sake of argument, let's say that it is one of them. Do you have to go with something safe for the other slot? Like ""Captain America 3"" or ""Thor 3""? Well, I mean, I will tell you the nature of film releases nowadays is such that there are few key dates and you want to plant your flag on those dates. Which is now why you have seen announcements out to 2018. I think many of those movies could change -- any of those release dates can change when you're looking at five years ahead. But, your question is an interesting one -- and forget about the specifics of what the movie is about.If you look at next year, you have a safe movie, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and a risk, ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" None of them are safe. But, you're right. Do you have a more established property and then introduce a new property? That feels like a good ... it feels like it makes sense to me and is something that we consider when we're putting the slate together. But a lot of it also depends on what's ready and who's available. It's why we didn't put out another movie the year we put out ""Avengers."" Because it's so big. Although we are when ""Avengers 2"" comes out with ""Ant-Man.""Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment. You can contact him directly on Twitter."
2,WELLNESS,Asian Immigrants: Eating  in Lean Times Can Be Good and Delicious,"Andrew Lam, Contributor
Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/asian-immigrants-eating-i_us_5b9d5e1ee4b03a1dcc871eff,"Does frugality have to be synonymous with being unhealthy? ""The answer is no,"" said New York chef Irene Khin, who runs Saffron59, a catering business that specializes in Asian-fusion cuisine told me. ""You can make a nutritious meal for less than a McDonalds' lunch combo and feed three people.""",2013-07-20,2013-07-20-goicuoncohuehochiminh_15112011101635.jpg.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-07-20-goicuoncohuehochiminh_15112011101635.jpg.png,"SAN FRANCISCO - Studies show that immigrants gain weight and their children tend to live shorter lives than them, and that their eating habits change for the worse the longer they stay. But there is very little information on how many revert back to their cultural habits in difficult economic times -- and how many actually become healthier as a result. A few years ago I interviewed Thien Tran,47, who came from Vietnam and managed a beauty salon and nail spa on Nob Hill, and he said that he had been eating better and losing weight since the economic downturn. ""My wife makes Vietnamese food and I take it to work,"" noted Thien. ""I used to order burgers and fries or Thai noodles, but that is too expensive. My lunch went from $8 to $2 a day."" In lean times, Thien had returned to eating his traditional Vietnamese foods. ""It's either rice and fish, rice and salted pork, rice and steamed chicken, with lots of vegetable,"" he rattled off his menu, laughing.Mr. Wang, 67, lived in a three generational household in a crowded two bedroom apartment near the Tenderloin here in San Francisco, came from Hong Kong where he worked for years in a restaurant as a chef. He retired but his wife was out of a job when the recession hit in 2009. Now she works part time in a grocery store. But Mr. Wang has been most useful: he goes to Chinatown everyday to find the freshest and cheapest bargain and cooks for his wife, son and daughter in law, and his 3 grandchildren. ""For 7 people, we are eating very well for maybe $35 dollars a day."" The trick he said, ""is time and patience. And you have to have cooking experience."" A regular meal at the Wangs: Steam chicken with ginger, fried tofu, fish in black bean sauce, stir fry bok choy in garlic, fresh fruit. It's a cultural defense against an economic crisis that works for many who come from Asia and other parts of the world. After all, it's not just Thien's waistline that's shrinking -- his pocket book is too, as less customers are able to afford his services. ""They come,"" he noted with a sigh, ""when the roots are really showing [for a dye job]. And instead of three weeks, now it's six weeks for nails."" Vietnamese fresh spring roll From beauty to shopping and eating out, American behaviors are changing radically. Macaroni and cheese boxes are selling swiftly, along with Spam, the canned luncheon meat invented during the Depression era. From McDonalds' value meals to Burger King's two bite-sized burgers for $1.39 to Starbucks' $3.95 coffee with an egg sandwich, cup of oatmeal or coffee cake, businesses are luring customers with low-priced, high-calorie menu items. Over all, the trend is that people's eating habits are worse off in down economic time. ""Mothers who work full-time reported fewer family meals, more frequent fast food meals, less frequent encouragement of healthy eating, and lower fruit and vegetable intake,"" According to to Street Talk Live. ""Nutritional deficits in children could lead to some big and potentially life-long problems for children, who may have more health issues, behavioral problems and academic performance issues."" But does frugality have to be synonymous with being unhealthy?""The answer is no,"" said New York chef Irene Khin, who runs Saffron59, a catering business that specializes in Asian-fusion cuisine told me. ""You can make a nutritious meal for less than a McDonalds' lunch combo and feed three people,"" she said. In fact, Khin often cooks lunch with her staff of four. ""We made Chop Chae [Korean mixed vegetables with beef and noodles] enough for six. It costs around $12.""Andrea Nguyen, a cooking teacher and the author of the cookbooks such as Into the Vietnamese Kitchen: Treasured Foodways, Modern Flavors, and Asian Tofu, readily agreed ""Being poor doesn't translate to eating badly,"" said Nguyen, who runs a website on Vietnamese cooking. A few years ago, she ""saw on CNN where a reporter went shopping for $6.42 a day as if he were on food stamps, and I thought I could eat lots of rice, vegetables, tofu and small, inexpensive fish on that amount of money."" The reporter would do better, Nguyen noted, if he were to shop at ""ethnic markets,"" which she said are ""great sources for fresh, reasonably priced ingredients."" In addition to being cheap, traditional Asian foods can be very flavorful, she said. ""Soy sauce, fish sauce, chili, ginger and lime would provide lots of flavor. Mung beans and soy products would lend protein."" It's a matter of cooking your own food, according to Nguyen. ""People can save a lot of money if they prepare more meals at home."" Seafood curryThe perennial complaint is that home cooking takes time. But Khin quickly dismissed that idea. ""I can make steamed rice and several dishes, and store it in the fridge for a week. You can eat well and healthy for very little if you're willing to put effort into it."" Khin suggested delicious recipes like Curry Fish and Panthay Noodle that take less than 20 minutes to make. ""When money is tight you can still eat well,"" said Andrea Nguyen. ""In fact, when my family came to the U.S. from Vietnam, we made the most wonderful meals from inexpensive chicken backs that we simmered for stock and then removed the meat and skin for rice. I fondly remember the flavors of those 'lean' times -- though we were eating much richer foods then than we are today!""But it's not just a culinary habit for immigrants. Chef Irene Khin, who came here as an immigrant from Burma, said the most important message for Americans to hear is that being frugal doesn't have to mean being unhealthy.By ""taking advantage of other cultures around you,"" Khin said, ""you can find good recipes and make something healthy for yourself and your family and save money. You don't have to eat roast potato with steak all the time.""

""It feels quite hard to face this, with the fact that I lost my brother.""""I don't think that justice was done,"" said Adam Csepi, a 24-year-old dancer whose spine was damaged in the accident.""I was dancing since I was a child. I wanted it to be my career. This is not going to bring my life back. Even 20 years (jail) would not bring my career back, but they do deserve more than this.""Lawyers for the victims decried the verdicts as ""shameful"" and said they might appeal to Italy's appeals court to overturn the plea bargains that allowed reduced sentences in return for guilty pleas.""The plea bargains are unacceptable, they shouldn't have been proposed or accepted. These sentences are ridiculous in the face of 32 dead,"" said Gabriele dalle Luche, who represents a group of Russian passengers, saying he would consider an appeal.""This is shameful justice,"" lawyer Massimiliano Gabrielli told reporters before storming away in anger. ""Truly, these sentences are shameful. I'm not talking any more. Goodbye.""The disaster occurred when the huge cruise liner hit a rock as it sailed close to the picturesque island of Giglio, prompting a chaotic evacuation of more than 4,000 passengers and crew.Costa Cruises, a unit of Carnival Corp , avoided a criminal trial by agreeing to pay 1 million euro ($1.31 million) fine in April, but victims are pursuing damages in a civil case. GUILTY PLEASCaptain Francesco Schettino, 52, remains on trial for manslaughter and causing the loss of his ship. He is also seeking a plea bargain to reduce a possible jail sentence.The court gave the crisis coordinator for vessel owner Costa Cruises, Roberto Ferrarini, the lengthiest sentence of two years, 10 months, followed by cabin services manager Manrico Giampedroni who was given two-and-a-half years.Three others including first officer Ciro Ambrosio were given suspended sentences of under two years.Short penalties for non-violent crimes are routinely suspended under Italian law.On Wednesday, Schettino's lawyers offered to accept a sentence of three years, five months in return for a guilty plea. A previous offer to serve three years, four months was rejected in May and he risks a much heftier sentence if no plea bargain is agreed. Hearings resume in September.The captain is accused of abandoning ship before all crew and passengers had been rescued. A coastguard's angry phone order to him - ""Get back on board, damn it!"" - became a catch phrase in Italy after the accident.His lawyers say he prevented a worse disaster by steering the 290-metre (950-ft) vessel into shallow waters after the impact and that he was thrown overboard due to the angle of the leaning ship, which still lies rusting off the island."

This Week In Apple Rumors,Timothy Stenovec,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iwatch-release-date_us_5bb367d8e4b0fa920b97e435,"And on Tuesday, the Verge relayed a report from the Israeli business daily Calcalist that Apple is mulling the purchase of",2013-07-20,"The dock connector is seen on an Apple Inc. iPhone 5 on display during a launch event organized by SK Telecom Co. in Seoul, South Korea, on Friday, Dec. 7, 2012.

This week we heard rumors about Apple's long-awaited, yet-unnamed television, the iWatch, and, of course, possible details on the next version of the iPhone.So without further ado, here's This Week in Apple Rumors.Ad-Skipping, Gesture-Controlled Apple TelevisionThere was a lot of talk this week about the TV that is said to be in development. On Monday, Jessica Lessin broke the news that Apple is working on a service that would allow people to skip TV ads, and Apple would pay the networks for the money they'd lose with fewer people watching the ads.And on Tuesday, the Verge relayed a report from the Israeli business daily Calcalist that Apple is mulling the purchase of PrimeSense, an Israeli company that designs 3D sensors that allow people to interact with devices. PrimeSense technology is used in the Xbox Kinect. The rumored interest set off speculation that Apple could use this technology to build a TV that you control with your hands. Writing for Quartz, Christopher Mims suggests that the company's facial and body recognition technology could give an Apple TV the power to recognize who's watching, enabling the device to have customized profiles. But the most important question: Since the Apple TV already exists, will it be called the iTV?iWatch WatchAll eyes are on the so-called iWatch, and it would appear that Apple is moving full speed ahead on what could be one of the most highly anticipated products the company has yet developed ... if it's actually being developed. A report in the Financial Times on Sunday quoted sources who said that Apple is hiring ""aggressively"" for the iWatch project, and that ""several dozen employees"" are working on the wearable device. But there's still a long way to go: The FT reports that the iWatch ""would not be ready for launch until the latter part of next year."" This news comes on the heels of recent reports that Apple has moved to trademark ""iWatch"" in a half-dozen countries, including Japan, Russia, Turkey and Mexico.Slow-Motion VideoWe've heard a lot about the features of the next generation of the iPhone: Will it come with a fingerprint scanner? A 12-megapixel camera? A 13-megapixel camera?! The folks at 9to5Mac reported recently that the next iPhone -- which we'll call the iPhone 5S -- may come equipped with a camera that can record video at 120 frames per second, which would allow for sharp slow-motion video. (The iPhone 5 currently shoots video at 30 frames per second.) ""Indestructible"" Liquidmetal iPhoneJonathan S. Geller, the Boy Genius himself, predicted this week that the iPhone 5S will be made of Liquidmetal, an alloy that's two times as strong as titanium. Geller cited as evidence Apple's extension last year of a licensing agreement with Liquidmetal that takes it through 2014.iPad MiniIt's good news/bad news for those waiting for the next generation iPad Mini: The good news is that according to a report in Digitimes, which cites ""supply chain sources,"" the iPad's lighter and smaller sibling may be getting a Retina display and an ""almost bezel-free look."" But the bad news is that version is more than a few months off: Digitimes says the new tablet won't be released until the beginning of next year, although a ""lighter, thinner"" iPad Mini -- without a Retina display -- may be released in time for the holiday season."

The entire cast had miserable looks on their faces. So it didn't have anything,2013-07-20,"SAN DIEGO, CA - JULY 19: Actor Bill Hader speaks with Xbox Video at Comic-Con 2013 on July 19, 2013 in San Diego, California. (Photo by Joe Scarnici/Getty Images for Xbox)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4316c2600003500824968.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There's a section of this interview I conducted with Bill Hader here at San Diego Comic-Con that I debated heavily over including or not. I chose to include it, but I need to set up what happened. Back in May, Hader announced that he was leaving ""Saturday Night Live"" after eight seasons. The day of the announcement, I wrote an essay on Hader's legacy at ""SNL."" As it turns out (and as I found out here), Hader read that piece. I'm only including this because, in that particular part of the conversation, Hader reveals just how down he was the day of that announcement, which gives insight on what it's like to leave a show like ""SNL"" -- a show that Hader still clearly loves.Hader is at Comic-Con to promote his involvement in the animated film ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2."" It's an interesting time for Hader. Obviously ""SNL"" is behind him and something like an animated sequel is familiar work. But he also has ""The Skeleton Twins"" coming up, which he co-stars in with Kristen Wiig. What's remarkable about that familiar pairing, however, is that ""The Skeleton Twins"" is a drama. Ahead, Hader reflects on his time on ""SNL,"" some of his personal favorite sketches and gives us a glimpse of what we might see from him in the future.The last time we spoke was for the first ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs."" We talked about the largest McDonald's in the world in Oklahoma. Oh! I do remember this. In Vinita, Okla. Wait, are you Mike Ryan?Yes. The day it came out that I was leaving ""SNL,"" I came in to ""SNL"" on Tuesday, and it was a little like, ""Hey, everybody."" Everyone knew, but it was still, ""Oh, it was in The New York Times this morning."" And so, I was a little like -- it's not bad, it was just kind of that I, personally, was feeling a little weird. And it was nice: Rob Klein, one of the writers, showed me that nice thing you wrote about me. That was such a nice -- because you never know. And to be honest, I have such weird tunnel vision because I don't really read stuff.I have heard you say many times that you don't read about yourself on the Internet. I don't. I just found out what Spotify was, like, yesterday. I don't know anything, you know what I mean? And so, I'm always out of the loop on those things. I used to really catch up on stuff and then, you know, you just start reading bad things -- and you kind of go, ""Oh, this is affecting me in a weird way; I don't want to read this."" But I guess the nice thing about me is I'm harder on myself more than anybody can be on me. But, reading that kind of made me go, ""Aw, man, this guy actually really paid attention.""I remember interviewing Will Forte shortly after he left ""SNL."" He said that it didn't hit him that he was gone until the next season started. Yeah, that's what everyone tells me. Amy Poehler told me that. She said, ""That's when it really hits you is when that first show comes back and you're not there."" So I guess I haven't fully gone through it, you know?I like to think it was during the Justin Bieber show that you decided to leave. It was. It was.Was it really? Yeah, yeah. It was. We did the Justin Bieber pitch meeting on Monday. Everyone left and I just stayed in Lorne's office -- we did it and then I asked Lorne if I could talk to him. I ended up talking to him that writing night. That's was when I came in and told him. But I think Lorne kind of knew I wanted to move. Because it was really about me moving to L.A., about me moving to California.The Justin Bieber show was kind of miserable. The entire cast had miserable looks on their faces. So it didn't have anything to do with that particular show being off? No, it wasn't so much that. It's funny. I got all this stuff; people said I slammed Justin Bieber on Howard Stern. I never felt like I really did. I was just kind of saying he has a big entourage.I thought you were kind, actually. Well, he has a big entourage and that was just -- that's all I said, he has a big entourage. But it's more of -- being honest -- by that point in the season, you're so worn down. And I feel that January to March time always kind of turns into a weird blur, where you're just like, ""What?"" I was looking at the pictures and I was like, ""Christoph Waltz hosted?"" I was in the fucking show! I was so out of it.That's the opposite of the Bieber episode. That show was amazing. Yeah, but I'm so out of it, you know? And he's great. And then you're, ""Oh, yeah, he was fuckin' awesome."" You're just so in a fog. That's why my last episode, people asked, ""Oh, was it emotional?"" And it was emotional doing that last Stefon thing when Seth got up. I got a little emotional doing that. But, I'm in the car afterwards, and it was just like any episode. I thought,""Was that thing funny? Did that work? I'm sad I'll never see Anthony Peter Coleman again. Oh! Yeah, yeah. The puppet guy.I was disappointed that didn't become a recurring sketch. Yeah, we're like, ""Well, how would you bring him back? He's in another puppet class?"" I liked that we did that and it worked so well that it was like, ""Don't touch it,"" you know? Lorne's never gonna ask you to do anything, but he'd be like, ""That was funny."" And then it's kind of like, if you ever want to do that again, you probably could. But we were like, ""Oh, it works."" But, Anthony Coleman was fun and it worked so well that it was like, we just couldn't -- how do you bring it back, you know?What kind of career are you looking for now, post-SNL? Do you look at someone like Forte who is now in an Alexander Payne movie? ""Nebraska,"" yeah. Yeah, it's really cool.Do you see yourself doing something like that, or do you just want to do comedy? No, no. Well, I just did this movie with Kristin Wiig called ""The Skeleton Twins."" That's a straight drama. We play estranged twins and I end up moving in with her and her husband, played by Luke Wilson. But it's a drama, and the Duplass Brothers produced it and this great guy, Craig Johnson, directed it. And that was great, you know? I'd like to do more stuff like that, and mix it up a little bit.So with drama now, is that what you want? Because everyone thinks of you as ""Bill Hader, funny guy."" Are you trying to get rid of that a little bit? No, it's not a conscious thing to get rid of it; it's just to do what's interesting. ""Skeleton Twins"" with Kristen has some really tough scenes in it, and it's a really hard. My wife read it and said, ""Jesus, this is really -- wow, this awesome that you're gonna do this."" And so I was like, ""Yeah, I want to do that.""But as far as post-SNL career, whatever kind of comes my way that looks interesting, I'll do it, you know? But I do always like those guys who kind of swerved and just kind of went to whatever -- I'm a fan of a lot of things, and so, you try to do those things ... you kind of start wide and then you kind of see people do that in their careers. They kind of just get down to ""I'm good at this."" You know what I mean? And they will pay me a lot of money to do this. You know, you see people kind of go that way. I'm hoping that I can kind of keep it wide, you know?Is that part of the reason you left ""SNL,"" too? Were you feeling like that was happening? No, no. If anything, with ""SNL,"" it was every week. That's what was so nice about my last season was that I got to do Anthony Coleman and that that was a character I did in my last season. That made me really happy that I got to do that even in my last season -- I had good writers and people able to do new moves.""SNL"" will look a lot different next season. Yeah. But they're really good people. Taran's great. You know who's great? Tim Robinson is really fucking funny -- I know because I've seen him on Wednesday at the table read.Why doesn't he get more stuff on? Well, you're gonna see. Because the same the thing happened to me. I didn't get as much laughs as Tim does at the reads -- but Lorne does that on purpose. He holds you back. He kind of figures out how do you connect to that live audience. Not you, none of that. That live audience, which, that is the audience. We want to make them laugh. So, that was the thing. And so it's like this Venn diagram of here's what I find funny and here's what that live audience finds funny and that's what works on ""SNL"". And you try to find that thing. And that took me four seasons to really figure that out -- to where Lorne was like, ""Yeah! That worked.""What was the first sketch you felt that way? ""Vinny Vedecci"" with Julia Louis-Dreyfus. And that one, when I did it, it had jokes in it where everyone laughed. And I remember when I came into the writers' room, everyone applauded -- because everyone kind of was like, ""He needed that."" And so I was kind of, ""That's sweet."" But Tim, he will have that. And he'll have great shit -- ""Z Shirt"" was great. He wrote that ""New Balance"" thing. He wrote a thing for Zach Galifianakis that is, for me, the only time in my life where I've ever fallen out of my seat laughing at a table read. It was a thing Tim Robinson wrote for Zach Galifianakis where he played a lawyer. And I don't want to ruin it...Oh, it didn't air? No. It had to do with a lawyer and it had to do with a briefcase. And it was the hardest I've ever laughed in my life. At that table read. Of everybody who's been at a table read, I fell on the floor and said, ""I'm going to throw up.""Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment.

6,ENTERTAINMENT,Joel Kinnaman On 'RoboCop' And Why It's Different Than The Original,Mike Ryan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joel-kinnaman-robocop_us_5bb4316fe4b066f8d25607ac,"Oh, that's interesting. We spend more with him when he's on the job and we spend more time with him and his family. We get",2013-07-20,"SAN DIEGO, CA - JULY 19: Actor Joel Kinnaman speaks onstage at the Sony and Screen Gems panel during Comic-Con International 2013 at San Diego Convention Center on July 19, 2013 in San Diego, California. (Photo by Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4316f220000ba01dc0a6a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jose Padilha's ""RoboCop"" remake remains a mystery to me, other than the fact that it stars Joel Kinnaman as RoboCop and -- I assume -- is about a police officer who becomes a cyborg of some kind. On the plus side, casting Kinnaman -- who is best known for the role of the sometimes sketchy police detective Stephen Holder on ""The Killing"" -- instead of another run-of-the-mill hunk of the week is downright inspired. As is the rest of the cast: Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman and Abbie Cornish.Plus, Padilha's is very respected as a director after his Brazilian ""Elite Squad"" films. On the downside, there's the recent remake of ""Total Recall,"" which was also based on a beloved film from director Paul Verhoeven and didn't exactly light it up either critically or financially upon release. So, what's to say that this will be any different?I met with Kinnaman -- our new Alex Murphy/RoboCop -- at his San Diego Comic-Con hotel to discuss just that: How is this ""RoboCop"" different than what we've seen before? (More on the ""RoboCop"" panel that happened at Hall H after our chat can be found here. I have to admit, I know very little about the new ""RoboCop"" movie. What are the obvious differences between this one and the one we already know? Well, I mean, the most obvious --You're in it. Well, that's one thing. But the original was made in 1986, came out '87, so the fantasies that they had about where robotics would be and what kind of influence that would have on society was much more of science fiction. Whereas now, in 2013 and 2014, that's become a reality. And we can see it's much our fantasies of where robotics is and how that would be implemented in military use and in law enforcement, but there's so many other aspects of our lives that are being automatized that is not science-fiction anymore. Or the ideas of that are already here. And there's a lot of moral questions that are going to be asked and need to be discussed in the coming 10 years. And, so, that's why it's a great opportunity to sort of reboot this franchise to discuss those things.It does sounds different. But there's still no way it's not going to be compared to the original ""RoboCop."" In a perfect world, would you almost prefer it be called ""Robot Cop"", or whatever. So it's its own thing? I mean, it's hard to say. Of course, you know, ""RoboCop"" is such a ...There's name recognition. You know what it is. It's the same thing with ""Batman"" and after some time is gone -- it's the same thing that we've always done when you look at theater plays. You know, we remake ""Hamlet"" all the time. That's sort of what we do, humans. When there's something good in a story, when there's something that really appeals to people, then we want to retell that. I mean, we've always done that since the caveman days.I think people worried because of ""Total Recall"", because it was the same director. And I think that's on people's minds. What do you mean same director?I mean the original films were both directed by Paul Verhoeven. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, I think fans feel ownership over the original and they don't want the remake to destroy it. If the remake sucks, then nobody is going to pay attention to that anyway. And if it doesn't suck, then it brings something new to the table and then it's something new to appreciate. So that's why I don't really buy that argument. But, in this case, there's many reasons why Hollywood makes remakes. Of course it's a money-making business and it's something that's already branded and, you know, of course there's always that aspect. But, for me, my guidance is always the director. And in this case, we have a phenomenal director, José Padilha. His ""Elite Squad"" movies were gritty, realistic, original.He's an interesting director. And he's a tough guy, too. Even though this was his first Hollywood movie, he has fought through to make this something original and not just another movie where we see a city get blown up in CG, which I'm personally very bored of.I'm really happy that you said that. There's a lot of CG in this movie, but I feel that it's put to use. I mean, of course, there's action sequences that are big action -- there's a lot of action in this movie. There's a lot. But I feel that there's a lot of story that's building up behind that action, so it matters. You know? It's not just mindless action.Is it going to be as bloody as the original? A man is shot in the penis in the original. No, it's not. I mean, Verhoeven had a very special tone and I find him one of the great directors of our time. And he had this whole idea of ultra-violence. And some of his movies were the most violent movies out there. And what he said was that when the -- what is that board called, the censorship board?The MPAA? Yeah, yeah. And they would take frames out, of the violence, where you didn't see it and it became much scarier to watch because his violence was over the top -- and that made it unrealistic, in a sense. And this is a different director, so he doesn't have the same tone, you know? And it doesn't have that style of violence, but it's violent.I've admired you as an actor ever since the first season of ""The Killing."" But when I first heard you were gonna be ""RoboCop"", it didn't register right away. Does that make sense? Yeah. No, I mean, I get that. I mean, for me, it's -- you know, in this movie, we spend more time with Alex Murphy before he becomes RoboCop.Oh, that's interesting. We spend more with him when he's on the job and we spend more time with him and his family. We get a much stronger sense of who he was before the transition of the movie happened. And that is who the character is: Alex Murphy. So, that's the guy that I'm auditioning for. And then, of course, it's this guy that's going through this --experiencing being amputated from his throat down, pretty much. And he has all these new powers, but he's lost everything that matters to him. So, it's a lot of drama in it. It was very interesting for an actor to go through. And then it also sort of portrayed the artificial intelligence -- manipulation of his brain and how he loses control over his emotions and his emotions sort of recede. But he still has interactions with his wife and son, but he doesn't feel anything. And then it's sort of a struggle within him in his soul to sort of come back and sort of beat the artificial intelligence.Did you like the suit? Eh, I liked looking at it. Can't say that I loved wearing it.Anyone who's ever been in an ""Iron Man"" movie always says that, too. I heard Robert Downey Jr. got it down; his suit is mostly CG.Yeah, he won't wear the suit anymore. That sounds amazing.You should write that in your next contract. Yeah, for sure. ""I know I'm RoboCop, but I'm not wearing the RoboCop suit."" You know, I'm actually glad that I wore the suit for the character, because that was the way that he walked.In real life, you probably couldn't fight crime wearing that suit. You wouldn't be that effective. And don't try swimming in it. You'd sink like a stone. But it was good for how I worked out my movements and all that. I mean, I sort of had a sketch of how I wanted to be moving, but as soon as I put the suit on, it was a completely different pattern of moving. And of course, I'm not doing what Peter Weller did. And that also comes down to the idea of what a robot would be in 1987 and 2014. Our idea of a robot is more like a superhuman, you know? And his movement pattern would be that, as well.Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment. You can contact him directly on Twitter."

The Wrap appeared to break the news, followed closely by THR and Deadline.com. All industry publications had been following the story -- which sent Harvey Weinstein himself to the airwaves to put pressure on Warner Bros. and the MPAA -- for the duration of the conflict. The dispute centered on Warner Bros.' claim that a 1916 short film of the same name should be enough to prohibit TWC from using the words ""The Butler"" in the title for a new movie (more information on the original complaints and rulings below.)Friday's news was touted as a victory by The Weinstein Company, which had previously been banned from using the words ""The Butler"" in any way in the film's title. The MPAA reversal (of sorts) comes with some restrictions: ""All letters of all words in the title must be in the same size and prominence as the size and prominence of the word 'butler,' except if the name 'Lee Daniels' is used int he title, then 'Lee Daniels' must be of a size at least 75 percent and of equal prominence to the word 'butler.'"" The ruling, which came from the MPAA's Title Registration Bureau, did find The Weinstein Company in violation of a number of its provisions and levied fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars against the company ($400,000, for example, must be paid by July 26). The MPAA's full ruling can be found here.From our earlier coverage:The battle between Warner Bros. and The Weinstein Company over the ""The Butler"" took another turn on Wednesday when director Lee Daniels sent a letter to Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara requesting that the studio back off from its attempt to force ""The Butler"" to change titles."
