It seems that at any given checkout lane, Aniston can be found posing on magazine covers, flashing a super-likeable smile and beaming superhuman sex appeal -- her hair meticulously tousled, her body professionally sculpted and svelte. Over the last few years, the standard headline with these photos has been something like, “Look how good Jen looks at 41 … 42 ... 43 years old.”More From U.S. News: Insanity Workout: Q&A With Creator Shaun T 5 People Who Are Changing the Face of Yoga Quiz: Which Celebs Credit Their Fitness to P90X?Aniston is now 44, and the obsession with her body continues. In addition to the endless hallucinations of baby bumps, media and fans are buzzing about her starring role in “We're the Millers,” a comedy released on August 7. Aniston plays a stripper who's hired to pose as a “normal” mom, and (of course), there's a scene in which she dances in teeny tiny underwear.The consensus seems to be that her body looks even fitter, tighter and more toned than usual, thanks to healthy eating and some serious training. And she didn't train alone. Mandy Ingber, Aniston's longtime yoga instructor, is one of a few professionals that helped the actress shape up for “We're the Millers.” Based in Los Angeles, Ingber has worked with several statuesque celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Beckinsale, Helen Hunt and Brooke Shields. In May, to follow up her 2009 “Yogalosophy” DVD, Ingber released a best-selling book titled “Yogalosophy: 28 Days to the Ultimate Mind-Body Makeover.”U.S. News talked with Ingber about working with Aniston and her own personal tips for looking and feeling fit enough to work the red carpet. Her responses have been edited.You've been working with Jennifer Aniston and many others for a long time. When training began for ""We're the Millers,"" what specific results were you and Aniston aiming for -- especially given that risqué strip scene?The main result we wanted was for her to feel comfortable in her body. Jen has a really good natural connection to her body, and I think that really shows. With the yoga portion of her workouts, obviously I am looking for things like balance and agility, in addition to the transition from movement to movement, which primarily involves core strength, presence and focus.How did you shape the new regimen to achieve those results?Through balancing poses and taking poses to a more aspirational level, like lifting the fingertips off of the mat in half moon, or extending both arms in a basic triangle. Also, the flow part of a yoga class lends itself to body control through constant movement. And Jen having a strong foundation to start with was helpful. She also worked with a dance instructor to rehearse all of her moves.Let's talk about your workout routines -- what are a few of your go-to snacks for before and after exercising?I love nuts. A handful of almonds, cashews or walnuts will get me through a couple of hours. They're a no-sugar, highly nutritious snack.Also, it's important to have some healthy fats to curb hunger. I love a good old fashioned sliced apple sprinkled with salt and cinnamon, and sometimes cayenne, to enhance the flavor and give it a kick. I'm a big green tea drinker from way back. My favorite is jasmine green tea. I also love all green vegetable juices to sneak in my greens while I hydrate. I also love coconut and almond milks. And I love chocolate.It seems like you have a packed schedule that can get a bit stressful. What techniques help you relax?I meditate. They say meditate 20 minutes a day, and if you are really busy, meditate for 40. And I write -- I actually write a gratitude list daily. This helps me focus on the right things, as opposed to a list of must-do items.I love to take a walk to get myself present and to wind my mind down. Sometimes being active and getting the body moving, while very simple, is incredibly grounding. I have my own yoga practice, and I love to do cardio as well -- I'm also a spinning instructor. These things help me to keep my head on straight.Mainly, I try to bring balance into my life. I schedule ""me"" time because just like everyone else, I need to unwind. I try to remember to take it easy and breathe. Everything is going to get done. And no one thing is going to make or break me.Many of our readers are likely reading this as they sit at a desk, perhaps at work. Do you recommend any quick, office-friendly exercises or yoga poses so they can sneak some exercise into their workday?Yes, you can do a seated pigeon position by just crossing your ankle over your knee, which will stretch the outer hip. Also from a seat, you can forward fold your whole body so that your belly is resting on your thighs -- that's a wonderful stretch. A great abdominal exercise is bracing yourself in the chair and pressing down, using your arms, in order to lift your butt off the chair and feet off the floor -- Ellen DeGeneres style!Also, a five-minute dance party in the office never hurt anybody. Or even a short lunchtime walk will lift spirits and improve happiness. I actually work with the staff of the ""Chelsea Lately"" show, and they get a yoga break instead of a coffee break."

What's more, men take home most of the prestigious scientific awards. That includes the Nobel Prizes, widely considered the ultimate mark of scientific achievement.Of the 357 people awarded a Nobel in the science categories — Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Economic Sciences — only 16 have been women (see slideshow below). What accounts for this discrepancy?""This low representation is likely due to there unfortunately being very few women scientists in the first half of the 20th Century,"" Dr. Hannah Dougdale and Dr. Julia Schroeder, two researchers at the University of Sheffield who have studied barriers for women in the sciences, told The Huffington Post in an email. Until the 1970s the number of women who received Nobel Prizes was roughly proportional to the number of women doing scientific research — a small group of women winning a small number of Nobels. But as the number of women in science has increased over the past 40 years, women Nobelists remain the exception, according to an article in Significance magazine by Stephanie Kovalchik, a statistician at the National Cancer Institute. ""The evidence suggests that, in the first half of the 20th Century, qualified women were struggling to enter the scientific profession but those who broke through were as valued as their male colleagues,"" Kovalchik wrote. Today, that may no longer be the case.Mary Ann Liebert, the founder of the Rosalind Franklin Society, a group committed to securing Nobel nominations for women, told NPR that she thinks women who deserve prizes are often overlooked -- because nobody steps forward to nominate them. ""Men tend not to nominate them, and women don't nominate themselves,"" Liebert told NPR. ""Women scientists have to be more assertive in seeking nominations. I think that's a major issue. And I think men have to put women's names into nomination, too.""Dugdale and Schroeder also found that women appear as invited speakers at conferences less often than men, leading them to conclude that ""low visibility of high-quality female scientists potentially means that their work does not attract the attention that it deserves, and importantly it has the effect that scientists and students are exposed to fewer female role models."" Check out our list below of the 16 women who have won a Nobel Prize in science.Correction: A previous version of the article misstated Liebert's name as Lambert."

Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2fbfb250000cf003898d8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - U.S. authorities have opened an investigation into whether JPMorgan Chase & Co Investment banks have a long history of employing the children of China's politically connected. While close ties to top government officials is a boon to any banking franchise across the world, it's especially beneficial in China, where relationships and personal connections play a critical role in business decisions.The approval process for a stock offering in China, for example, is one area that has come under criticism inside and outside the country for being opaque and prone to cronyism.For JPMorgan, the China hiring probe comes while the bank is under intense scrutiny following the $6 billion trading loss it suffered in the ""London whale"" derivatives scandal. Federal prosecutors on Wednesday brought criminal charges against two former JPMorgan traders - Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout - accusing the pair of deliberately understating losses on the trades on the bank's books.A report posted in the Times' online Saturday edition cited a confidential U.S. government document as its source for the story on the China hiring probe. The Times said the probe is a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission's anti-bribery unit.The Times said JPMorgan hired Tang Xiaoning, the son of Tang Shuangning, a former Chinese banking regulator. Tang Xiaoning is now the chairman of the China Everbright Group, a state-controlled financial conglomerate.After the son joined JPMorgan, the bank secured several important assignments from the Chinese conglomerate, including advising a subsidiary of the company on a stock offering, the Times reported.The Hong Kong office of JPMorgan also hired Zhang Xixi, the daughter of a now-disgraced Chinese railway official, and went on to help advise his company, which builds railways for the Chinese government, on its plans to become a public company, the Times said.A spokesmen for the SEC could not be reached immediately by Reuters for comment. Zhang and Tang both have left JPMorgan, the newspaper said.JPMorgan made reference in its 10-Q quarterly filing this month to the inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.""We publicly disclosed this matter in our 10-Q filing last week and are fully cooperating with regulators,"" Marie Cheung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank, said on Sunday.The practice of hiring politically-connected bankers in China was widespread in the early to mid 2000's, when Wall Street firms engaged in so-called 'elephant hunting', a term used to describe the chasing of mandates to manage the multi-billion dollar stock offerings of the country's big state-owned enterprises.One of the more well known China bankers from that era is Margaret Ren, the daughter-in-law of former Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, who has worked at several banks. Most major investment banks have employed a politically connected Chinese banker, whether a high level professional such as Ren or a college age associate, at some stage in the last decade.Many senior investment bankers in China now feel that the heyday for such underwriting contracts has passed, with far fewer jumbo state-owned company listings happening. But banks and private equity firms alike still prize connections to top decision makers.""It's been happening for the past 20 years,"" said Ronald Wan, Chair Professor of Renmin University of China and a former banker, referring to the hiring of politically connected Chinese bankers. The key to the JPMorgan probe, he said, was whether these hirings had any special bonus attached or any actual corruption that could be traced.Wan added that such hiring happens all across the world, though in China, connections to the right people who know the system is especially useful.Battushig Batbold, the son of Mongolia's Prime Minister, has been an employee of Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2011.JPMorgan said in its filing that it had received ""a request from the SEC Division of Enforcement seeking information and documents relating to, among other matters, the firm's employment of certain former employees in Hong Kong and its business relationships with certain clients.""The newspaper report stressed that the government document did not definitively link JPMorgan's hiring practices to its ability to win business.It also said there had been no suggestion that the employees hired by the bank were unqualified and said JPMorgan, although under investigation, had not been accused of any wrongdoing.(Reporting by Tom Brown, Ian Simpson, Lawrence White and Michael Flaherty; Editing by Bill Trott and Raju Gopalakrishnan)"

It has not been named and its gender has not been determined.""Not only is this a first for Zoo Atlanta, going all the way back to our founding in 1889, but this is a critically endangered species that absolutely deserves the spotlight right now,"" Raymond King, the zoo's president, said in a statement. ""We hope that as we watch the calf grow up, we can spark new connections with wildlife that desperately need our support.""The calf, which does not yet sport its species' signature horn, was born to Andazi, a 7-year-old female, and her 9-year-old mate, Utenzi.It was the first offspring for both after the pair were recommended for breeding by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Rhino Species Survival Plan, which seeks to maintain a genetically diverse, self-sustaining rhino population in North American zoos.Andazi's pregnancy was confirmed in December and viewed through an ultrasound earlier this year.Rhinos have gestation periods ranging from 14 to 18 months. Calves are usually weaned within two years of being born, though they might remain with their mothers for up to four years.The eastern black rhino was hunted almost to extinction, and in recent decades it has suffered near-catastrophic population declines, largely due to poaching. Its horns, skin and other body parts are believed by some to have medicinal value.Conservation programs and patrolling of the rhino's habitats have helped populations to increase to about 4,800 in the wild. The western black rhino was declared extinct in 2011.Black rhinos were once the most numerous of the species, according to the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, where a calf was born a year ago. Black rhinos numbered 65,000 in 1970, but the global population had dropped to 15,000 by 1980. (Reporting by Noreen O'Donnell in New York; Editing by Karen Brooks and Paul Simao)"
