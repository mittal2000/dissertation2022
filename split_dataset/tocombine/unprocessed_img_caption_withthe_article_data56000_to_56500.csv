John Bel Edwards signed legislation making it a hate crime to kill a police officer or another first responder, bolstering penalties for an offense that already qualifies for the state's death penalty.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5745bc7e1a00008800c2992f.jpeg?cache=ldF27D4bIa&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) signed a bill this week that will allow prosecutors to seek longer sentences for people who attack police officers, EMTs or firefighters because they hate them.It's a strange policy that may turn out to be useless.The bill, HB 953, is widely known as “Blue Lives Matter,” a phrase patterned after the Black Lives Matter movement and that stands on the opposite side of criticisms of police brutality. The Blue Lives Matter movement argues that police officers are under siege and need extra protections. Louisiana, like many other states, was already punishing people who assault or kill cops more harshly than people who attack or kill, say, waitresses or pizza delivery guys. The state automatically classifies cop-killing as first-degree murder -- a charge that could result in the death penalty if convicted -- even when it's not premeditated. Assaulting or battering a police officer also comes with a harsher charge. It's easy for prosecutors to prove a victim of violence was a police officer, but proving intent and getting inside an offender's mind is extremely difficult. So why is Louisiana making prosecutors prove that an assault on a cop was motivated by hatred for cops when the state already has tougher penalties for attacking cops, regardless of the motivation? It's all about sending a message. By making police officers a protected class -- like race, national origin and religion -- the state is doing more to value its officers, said Louisiana state Rep. Lance Harris (R), the bill's author.But Dane S. Ciolino, a law professor at Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, doubts the new law will actually protect cops more than existing law did.“There’s certainly no gap in the criminal code,"" he said. ""It's just showboating for the constituents.”At least 37 states have enhanced penalties for assaulting a police officer, regardless of the attacker's motivation. Some states do that by considering harming a police officer to be an “aggravating factor,” which heightens the severity of the sentence for the alleged offense. In New York, being convicted in the aggravated murder of a police officer carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole. It is also an automatic first-degree charge. Michigan has a similar law. These protections extend beyond police officers. Florida law, for example, mandates that the assault or battery of public transit employees -- along with law enforcement officers, firefighters and EMTs -- be reclassified as a higher charge. Other jurisdictions -- including New York and Washington, D.C. -- add extra years in prison for assaulting a bus or taxi driver in hopes of deterring violence against transportation workers.Jack Levin, a criminologist at Northeastern University, worries that HB 953 may actually scale back current hate crimes statutes by including police officers.“We might very well dilute the hate crime law so that it is weakened beyond repair,"" he said. ""Originally the idea of hate crime statutes was to protect vulnerable groups of americans.”“There are a number of very dangerous occupations, but it’s not just the police who may be injured or killed on the job,"" Levin added.A U.S. city bus driver was assaulted every three days in 2012, according to estimates from the Amalgamated Transit Union, the largest labor union for transit workers in the U.S. and Canada. But Larry Hanley, international president of the ATU, doesn’t see the need to give public transit workers additional protection under hate crimes statutes.“To the extent that bus drivers represent the government, you could argue that this stems from some hatred of government workers,"" Hanley said. ""But, frankly, most of the crimes involving assaults on transit workers are connected to fare disputes, to people’s own mental issues -- we have people who get on buses who are mentally disturbed -- people who are drunk and engage in assault. So I’m not sure this really fits the mold."" Taxi drivers have also fought hard for the protections afforded to their profession -- and for good reason. They are 30 times more likely to be killed on the job than workers in other occupations, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Much like city bus drivers, they tend to work in isolated environments and transport potentially violent strangers.They are also more likely to belong to an already protected class under hate-crime statutes. Most cab drivers in New York, for example, immigrated to the U.S. from Bangladesh, Pakistan, India or Ecuador. On Saturday, Sirajul Islam Khan, a taxi driver in the Bronx, was attacked when he took out some cash to give a customer change. The assailant allegedly beat Khan and shouted that he would kill the cab driver -- not for being a cab driver, but for being Muslim.“Prosecuting crimes against a worker as a hate crime belies the long struggle for racial justice in our country,"" Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, told HuffPost. ""We have sought hate crime prosecution only when a driver has been targeted because of their race or religion. There are conditions that make workers vulnerable to crime on the job. But that is an occupational safety matter, not a hate crime.”Levin pointed out that for a brief period of time following large-scale anti-police brutality protests in Ferguson, Missouri, New York and Baltimore, ambushes of police officers did rise. But this was short-lived. “I would be much more likely to support the idea of expanding hate crime laws to protect police officers if there were some long-term trend whereby law enforcement was at greater risk than usual,” he said. Even E. Pete Adams, the executive director of the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, doubts his members will be able to do much with the new law.“Motivation is by its very nature hard to prove, but sometimes when the facts align correctly motivation can be shown,” Adams said. “But it is a challenge. It’s a challenge under the current law, it’ll be a challenge under the amendment.""The hate crime moniker, Adams emphasized, ""is merely a sentence enhancement tool."" And Louisiana already had laws that more harshly punish people who attack cops. “This legislation is unnecessary,"" Ciolino, the law professor, said. ""But the Louisiana criminal code is littered with unnecessary and redundant provisions, so this is nothing new.”This post was updated after the governor signed the bill into law."

2,BLACK VOICES,Ohio Deputies Caught Using Racist Language To Discuss Trayvon Martin,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-deputies-racist-recording_us_5744dda6e4b03ede44133603,Deputies were ordered to take sensitivity training after the secret recording of their crude comments surfaced.,2016-05-25,Two Hocking County detectives in Ohio were secretly recorded using offensive language to discuss the killing of Trayvon Martin. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5744e5c41600002a00f945fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two on-duty Ohio sheriff's detectives used racial epithets with co-workers while discussing the 2012 killing of Florida teen Trayvon Martin, according to a secret recording made by one of the deputies. A deputy who no longer works for the Hocking County sheriff's department recorded colleagues in 2013 calling Martin ""n-----"" and ""thug"" multiple times. One of the detectives used an accented voice to mock African-American callers to a radio program expressing outrage over the slaying of Martin, 17, by self-appointed town watchman George Zimmerman. The recording, made by former deputy Jeremy Dye, was first reported by the Logan Daily News last month. The Huffington Post independently obtained a copy of the audio this week. Dye declined to comment.The recording features Patrick Allison, who left the department after learning of the tape, joking about starting a business that sells crosses to burn in the yards of black people. “We should make a little money if they all pay us to burn crosses in negroes' yards,"" Allison says on the recording. ""We could sell portable crosses like a wood cross with a base. It could have the fire starter chunks built in it.”Edwin Downs, who still works for the sheriff's department, also used offensive language on the recording. ""Maybe you shouldn't be black,"" Downs said, referring to African-Americans worried about their children's safety after Martin was shot. The sheriff's department required Downs and Allison to take racial sensitivity training ""as soon as we heard about this incident,"" a spokesman told the Logan Daily News. ""Of course, I don't condone that at all, from them or anybody,"" Sheriff Lanny North told the Columbus Dispatch. ""We should be setting an example.""Hocking County, in southeast Ohio, had a population of 28,725 in 2014. More than 97 percent of residents were white and 0.7 percent were black, according to the census.The recordings came to light last year in a roundabout way, as part of a lawsuit filed by Hocking County Coroner David Cummin against North, Downs and other local officials. Cummin sued for malicious prosecution and intimidation of a public official after he had been accused of failing to do his job, according to The Columbus Dispatch. The case against Cummin was thrown out. ""Obviously someone is using them [the recordings] to try make them as public as possible to discredit Detective Downs and the sheriff,"" said attorney Randall Lambert, who represents Downs and North in the civil case.

Match.com found that 61 percent of LGBTQ singles said that last year's SCOTUS decision has no effect on their attitude toward marriage whatsoever.That's just one of many revelations found in LGBTQ in America, which Match is touting as the ""largest nationally-representative study of American singles who identify as LGBTQ"" and was produced in association with Dr. Justin R. Garcia, an evolutionary biologist and gender studies professor at Indiana University's Kinsey Institute. Among the other findings in the survey, which polled over 1,000 LGBTQ singles between the ages of 18 and 70-plus: 74 percent said their family would support them in a same-sex marriage. Fifty-two percent of lesbians said they want kids, compared to 36 percent of gay men. Mobile apps, unsurprisingly, are the new matchmakers, with 56 percent of respondents saying they've dated someone they've met online. Released May 24, LGBTQ in America represents an expanded take on Match's annual Singles in America report. According to Garcia, the revised research was intended to include ""more people of diverse identities"" in an effort to ""better understand singles today.""""Today’s society is full of rich gender and sexual diversity, however relatively little is known about the dating experiences of LGBTQ people,"" Garcia said in a press release. The research is insightful, he said, because ""nearly half of the LGBTQ population in America identifies as single, and a vast majority of these singles, some 80 percent, are seeking a committed relationship.""

4,SPORTS,Bismack Biyombo Has Become The Unlikely Answer To Raptors' Prayers,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bismack-biyombo-has-become-answer-for-raptors-prayers_us_57450e32e4b0dacf7ad35c74,"The 23-year-old Congolese center has gone from reserve to shot-blocking, sterling starter.",2016-05-25,"Center Bismack Biyombo, 23, has averaged 9 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks since entering the starting lineup in Game 4 of Toronto versus Miami.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57453b7d1300000105382ab8.jpeg?cache=GmBwfzFPMR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If the name Bismack Biyombo was only familiar to NBA League Pass aficionados before the 2016 playoffs, it has now become near folklore.That's what happens when you collect 26 rebounds in the Eastern Conference Finals, as he did in Game 3. And it's also what happens when you become a finger-wagging Dikembe Mutombo clone, after blocking 3 shots and nabbing 14 boards in massive Game 4 win to even the series.Biyombo, the 23-year-old Congo native who went seventh overall in the 2011 draft to Sacramento -- before being dealt to Charlotte -- has helped change the tenor of a series with his infectious energy, the same energy which led me to tip him during the 2011 scouting process.Let's take a look at how the 6-foot-9, 245 lb. center has done it.Despite being a subpar free-throw shooter, Biyombo is semi-reliable mid-range guy who defenses can't entirely forget about. His range doesn't expand beyond the 16-foot range, but he is capable of making a jumper, something he couldn't do during most of his tenure with the Hornets. In this case, Cavs super stretch-four man Channing Frye gets caught sleeping on the DeMarre Carroll drive, only to allow an open look to Biyombo, who makes him pay.This is an added bonus for head coach Dwane Casey, who doesn't have to worry about him as a liability late in games.Biyombo, relentless per usual, displays impeccable timing to deny shots at the rim. He does it here in thwarting a Kevin Love drive, and then once more on LeBron James in what appears to be a clean block despite the foul call. Both were momentum building plays for a team that lost by a combined 50 points in Games 1 and 2.Below in Game 3, Biyombo denies Kyrie Irving's bid at the rim. Irving is one of the premier rim finishers at the rim, and otherwise had a clear path to the basket. Again, he takes a surefire two points -- and momentum -- away in a game where points are at a premium.Biyombo's brilliance as a defensive menace for Casey was tested in Game 4 versus Frye. Instead of keeping him on a non-shooter, Casey elected to have him extending on the perimeter. The strategy did not work, as Frye's prolific shooting in the playoffs continued.Therein lies the chess match between Casey and Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue. Both teams are deft at playing small ball, but the Raptors prefer to employ Biyombo at the four and a healthy Jonas Valanciunas at the five. Valanciunas has not played in this series due to an ankle injury though, and Biyombo -- who has started since Game 4 of the Miami series as a result -- has since averaged 9 points, 12 rebounds and over two blocks while converting 63 percent from the floor. Better yet, he has compiled the second-best net rating on the Raptors behind only point guard Kyle Lowry, according to NBA.com.Moreover, Biyombo's ability to hound the glass is only control the paint has been the key cog for Toronto's two consecutive wins against Cleveland. As a whole, his total rebounding percentage of 20.8 ranked fifth in the league this year, and only defensive unicorn Hassan Whiteside -- recently profiled by The Hufington fPost -- blocked a higher percentage of shots this season. Biyombo, who inked a two-year, $5.75 million deal before the 2014 season with the Raptors, will surely decline his player option this summer and command more dollars. Meanwhile, he has only amplified that production in the east finals, and now the pressure has firmly shifted to LeBron and the heavily favored Cavs.Click here to read my exclusive interview with Shaquille O’Neal and click here to learn about how the Oklahoma City Thunder has solved its biggest dilemma.

5,MEDIA,"New York Times Opts For Voluntary Buyouts, Not Layoffs -- For Now",Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-times-buyouts-layoffs_us_5745b6bfe4b03ede44136263,The announcement comes five days after editor Dean Baquet told anxious staffers no layoffs were planned this year.,2016-05-25,"The New York Times, which last offered buyouts in 2014, announced plans Wednesday for another round. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5745b70d1a00002f00c29919.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- The New York Times will offer voluntary buyout packages to members of its newsroom and several business departments in order to reduce costs, Times management informed staff Wednesday.""As everyone knows, we’re living through a period of incredible change in the news business,"" began the memo from publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chief executive Mark Thompson, executive editor Dean Baquet and editorial page editor James Bennet. The Times' top brass touted the news organization's successes, including now having ""almost two-and-a-half million paying subscribers in 193 countries."" The Times has significantly innovated, they noted, by expanding into new forms of storytelling, video and virtual reality.But, they wrote, ""like the rest of the industry, we face long-term pressure in both print and traditional digital display advertising."" The Times is looking to double its digital revenue and more than double its audience by 2020 -- goals that they say require more investment. And to pay for such investment, they wrote, the paper has to reduce costs. While no newsroom layoffs are currently planned, management said they ""cannot rule them out in the future.""The Times maintains a robust, 1,300-plus newsroom, which is roughly the same head count as eight years ago and a rarity in an industry that's dramatically downsized. Several well-known bylines were lost when the Times last offered newsroom-wide buyouts in 2014 in an attempt to cut 100 jobs. The company was forced to lay off around 20 people in early 2015 after not hitting its voluntary goal. In a separate memo Wednesday, Times senior editor Janet Elder wrote that buyout packages would be extended to all newsroom staffers of more than three years, whether or not they're represented by the paper's employee guild. However, newsroom staffers who work in video, graphics and digital design are not eligible, she wrote. The buyout announcement comes five days after Baquet told staffers that no newsroom layoffs were expected in 2016, an assurance given amid rumors of significant cutbacks.""I also know there is anxiety about cuts,"" Baquet said in a memo Friday. ""While no layoffs are planned in the newsroom for this calendar year, the company is planning other measures to cut costs, including in the newsroom.""The New York Post reported in April that the Times Company -- which also includes the business side of the operation -- was ""preparing to lay off a few hundred staffers in the second half of the year."" Days later, The Times announced it was closing its editing and print operations in Paris, resulting in ""the elimination or relocation of up to 70 jobs.""The Times' management acknowledged Wednesday that the buyout process is a difficult one, but stressed its necessity. ""We have gone through this buyout exercise before, and we know that it is not easy,"" they wrote. ""But we believe this is necessary for The New York Times to continue as the most ambitious news organization in the world.Read the memos below: Dear Colleagues,"
6,BUSINESS,Hillary Clinton Solved A Problem Corporate America Can’t Seem To Fix,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-diversity-campaign_us_5745ae19e4b03ede44135e32,Well done.,2016-05-25,Bernard Coleman is the first chief diversity officer to staff a presidential campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5745b1f21600002a00f946b7.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A little more than a year ago, when Hillary Clinton officially launched her history-making campaign for the presidency, she did something else unprecedented. She hired Bernard Coleman as the campaign’s chief diversity officer. The 36-year-old is responsible for helping Clinton -- the first woman with a real shot at the White House -- build a staff more reflective of the voters she hopes to win over, beyond the usual scrum of white guys who run political campaigns.Coleman, who says he is the first chief diversity officer ever employed by a presidential campaign, briefly held a similar role at the Democratic National Committee where he was director of human resources for six years.Clinton desperately needs Coleman, who is also the campaign's head of human resources, to succeed. A diverse staff is key to helping her understand an increasingly diverse electorate, where whites represent a declining percentage of voters. Without votes from people of color, Clinton likely cannot win the presidency -- a lesson she learned in 2008.“We want to have the most representative staff,” Coleman told The Huffington Post. “We’re always trying to crush it.""And by all accounts they are: Thirty percent of the 700 or so people on the Clinton campaign staff are non-white and 52 percent are women, according to data provided to The Huffington Post by Inclusv, a group that finds diverse candidates for political campaigns, advocacy groups and policymakers and also is pressing for candidates to report their staffs demographic data. (Former Obama campaign staffers founded the group last year.) Senior leadership on Clinton's staff is 54 percent women and 34 percent people of color, according to the latest data available, from March 31. The campaign won’t break down those figures any further to show what percent of staff are Hispanic or African-American. And, worryingly, the numbers haven't grown since the last time the campaign reported its diversity data in February. Yet it’s fairly clear -- just on the gender stats alone -- that in terms of staffing, this is likely the most diverse serious presidential campaign in U.S. history. (The smaller Bernie Sanders campaign hasn't yet reported its March data to Inclusv. But in February, a report revealed that, though 31 percent of the campaign's staff are people of color, all of its top paid staff are men.)There is not an official account of the Obama campaign staff's demographics -- nor of any campaign's prior to this year -- but Clinton 2016 is probably out ahead, Alida Garcia, executive director and cofounder of Inclusv, told HuffPost.""The [Clinton] headquarters in Brooklyn is likely more diverse than the 2012 operation in Chicago,"" said Garcia, who worked on Obama's 2012 campaign helping turn out the Latino vote. (Garcia also works with FWD.us, the immigration reform group founded by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.)Clinton's achievement is the result of a deliberate strategy spearheaded by the candidate herself, burned by her loss in the Democratic primaries in 2008, when her campaign seemed targeted mainly to white voters. She's of course spurred forward by the rapidly changing demographics of the country.“Clinton is really hitting diversity and it’s not by accident,” said Erikka Knuti, a political strategist who’s worked on Democratic campaigns and currently is a communications director for the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union. “The fact that she is doing it speaks to who she is and lessons learned,” she told HuffPost.Hiring a chief diversity officer is a tactic straight out of corporate America's playbook. Sixty percent of Fortune 100 companies employ a chief diversity officer, according to a 2012 analysis from executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles.Clinton's campaign has far surpassed the business world in diversity, though. The country’s biggest businesses still are remarkably homogenous -- particularly at the highest levels. Fewer than 4 percent of the chief executives who run S&P 500 companies are women, and the number has been falling. For African-Americans the numbers are even more grim. According to data cited by Fortune, black men and women make up 4.7 percent of executive team members in the Fortune 100. There have only been 15 black CEOs on the Fortune 500 -- ever.There’s plenty of evidence that a more diverse company will see a higher stock price and profits. And it's clear that the demographics of the nation -- i.e. consumers -- require a change. But companies have been slow to move, Billy Dexter, a partner at Heidrich & Struggles, told HuffPost.“If corporate America wanted to do this, they could,” he said. “Some organizations have.”The companies that have made inroads have approached the need to diversify as a business imperative, not just a moral one. The idea, Dexter said, is to make hiring diverse people as important as hitting profit goals: assign your best people to the task and look at the numbers quarterly. And the CEO must play a key role in driving the strategy.As diversity has clearly become a political imperative -- particularly for a Democratic candidate -- Clinton has done just that. In November, one-third of eligible voters in the U.S. will be Hispanic, black, Asian or belong to another racial or ethnic minority group, according to a report out from the Pew Research Center earlier this year. Democratic voters are even more diverse: 40 percent of Democrats identify as nonwhite, compared with 11 percent of Republicans, according to Gallup data from 2012. Women, of course, are not a minority -- though they seem to get treated as one. We comprise 52 percent of the voting population.Whites, meanwhile, are a declining interest group. This is well evidenced by the obvious racial panic behind Donald Trump's campaign, and in the data: In 2016, whites are projected to make up 69 percent of eligible voters, down from 78 percent in 2000.  Clinton learned all of this the hard way. She lost her bid for the Democratic nomination in 2008 in part by running a campaign that seemed to position her as the mainstream (read: white) candidate in contrast to Barack Obama.In a tactic the New York Times and others decried as “race-baiting,” she downplayed the amount of white support her opponent had. “I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on,” she told USA Today in 2008. “Sen. Obama’s support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again.” Obama's path to the nomination and the presidency came with the help of record black and Hispanic turnout. Now, turning out the African-American and Hispanic vote is recognized as critical to a Democratic victory in 2016.Given these realities, Coleman's mandate to diversify the campaign comes straight from the top, he said.“If she didn’t say this is important, then no one would move,” he told HuffPost. “The country is evolving and changing. Having diverse voices helps us message. It helps almost every facet.” The pressure to hire diverse staff is “constant,” Coleman said. “We talk about it with senior staff every week.”Just this week, the Clinton campaign hired Jess McIntosh, vice president of communications for EMILY’s List. She is known for being skilled at bringing in women and diverse voices, Knuti told HuffPost before the hire was announced.Coleman said a big part of his job is simply helping the campaign find good people -- and not allowing anyone to take “shortcuts” in hiring. Campaign hiring moves at lightning speed and the temptation is to just quickly bring in people you know well. Unfortunately, that's the easiest way reinforce a culture of sameness. It's how tech companies, which have also grown quickly, wind up hiring bro after bro after bro. One guy knows another guy who looks just like him. One thing Coleman's learned is if his colleagues take a little more time to think of good candidates, they find they actually know a pretty diverse group. People just need to focus, he said. “You need people to sit down in a room, get off their phones, open a Rolodex and say, 'Who do you know who does this?' You actually know a lot of people. It has to be deliberate.” After six years with the DNC, Coleman knows a lot of people. The bonus, he said, is people really want to work for the campaign, so they take his calls -- and help him find good candidates.Even the private sector wants to help. Coleman mentioned that the “open a Rolodex” strategy came from “a guy at Google,” whom Coleman declined to name, who wanted to help the campaign. Google, notably, has a large diversity team, as well as a chief diversity officer, though it hasn't seen much progress.It is easier to build a diverse campaign staff than a diverse company staff. Coleman has had the benefit of hiring a team from scratch. An established corporation cannot get rid of all its workers and start all over -- it can only hire so many new people every year. And the sense of urgency in a campaign, which comes with a built-in expiration date, is absent from a company.As Nov. 8 looms closer and the pace of hiring picks up, the Clinton campaign’s challenge will be to maintain its diversity, Garcia, of Inclusv, told HuffPost. There’s still room for improvement, she said, noting that the most recent data showed the campaign had stalled out in its push to diversify and that the percent of people of color on senior staff fell slightly to 34 percent from 36 percent.Inclusv wants to make sure those numbers rise as staffing scales up for a national campaign. It has been working with the campaign since last year, helping find candidates.“Quite honestly, based on our prior experience [with Clinton] we anticipated pushback,” said Garcia. “In reality, what we found was a willing and welcoming partner in Bernard Coleman to build upon an accessible ongoing conversation.” The end goal, of course, is a diverse White House. “At the end of the day, a lot of campaign staff ends up in government managing key policy initiatives for elected officials,” Garcia said.Coleman is aware of this. “Being White House chief diversity officer,” he said. “That would be pretty cool.”"

Howard, 18, and Tanner Ward, 17, who played for the school football team last year, were charged by the state attorney general's office with felony forcible penetration by use of a foreign object. If convicted, they face a maximum of life in prison. A 16-year-old former teammate faces similar charges, but in juvenile court, where the charges and disposition of the case are not publicly available.Prosecutors allege Howard and Ward sexually assaulted the victim, who was not identified, with a coat hanger while others participated or watched. The teen, according to court documents, has ""mental disorders including learning disabilities.""The assault took place inside a high school locker room on Oct. 23, 2015, according to court documents obtained by The Washington Post. A teammate, under the pretense of giving the victim a hug, restrained him while Ward ""physically forced a coat hanger into the plaintiff's rectum,"" the documents say.Howard kicked the coat hanger several times while it was inside the boy's rectum, the documents allege.""I screamed,"" the victim testified during an April preliminary hearing, according to Twin Falls Times-News‎. ""I was pretty upset. I felt really bad. A little bit betrayed and confused at the same time. It was terrible — a pain I've never felt.""The assault caused injuries that required medical treatment, authorities said.During last month's preliminary hearing, Ward's attorney, Michael J. Wood, said the victim's account was at odds with statements by other witnesses.""The testimony is so inherently conflicting so as not to prove the event,"" Wood said. The judge disagreed and ordered the case to continue to trial.The victim's family has filed a $10 million lawsuit against the school and 11 employees, including administrators and coaches who are accused of failing to stop the abuse.The lawsuit alleges the victim was subjected to frequent racist abuse by Howard and other teammates -- all of them white. The victim was ""taunted and called racist names by other members of the team, which names included 'Kool-Aid.' 'chicken eater,' 'watermelon,' and ['n-----'],"" the lawsuit alleges. It also claims the teen was subjected to wedgies, simulated anal sex and ""aggressive humping.""Howard, according to the lawsuit, was the leader of the abuse.""Mr. Howard is a large and aggressive male who had been sent to live with his relatives in Idaho due to his inability to keep out of trouble in Texas,"" the complaint says.Coaches and administrators ""ignored or were deliberately indifferent to the behavior of Mr. Howard, which included aggression, taunting and bullying of the plaintiff and other students in the district,"" the lawsuit alleges. ""With deliberate indifference, the defendants did nothing to curb the vicious acts of Mr. Howard who brought with him from Texas a culture of racial hatred towards the plaintiff.""Two of the students charged in the attack have since been expelled. Howard has returned to Texas, where he is finishing high school, The Washington Post reported.Howard is scheduled to appear in court again on June 10. Hearing dates for the other teens have not been announced."
8,BUSINESS,More Millennials Living At Home Reflects How America Has Changed,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/young-people-living-at-home_us_5745f077e4b03ede4413a29c,People don't pair off and move in together in their 20s anymore because they don't feel forced into marriage.,2016-05-25,Living at home may help millennials pay down their student debt and be ready to contribute to the economy a decade from now.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57460e901300000105382c2f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Being in your 20s is no longer a guaranteed marker of adulthood. The life steps that are most associated with becoming a ""real adult,"" like marriage, buying a home and having children, are now more likely than ever to be put off into one's 30s.It then should not be a surprise that more millennials, the largest crop of whom are in their 20s, continue to live at home. The change in living situations is a rational response to the way society has changed for young adults.A new report by Pew Research on the living arrangements of young people shows that more of them are living with their parents now than they were in any year after World War II. Thirty-two percent of millennials live with their parents, slightly more than those who live with a partner or spouse. The percentage of those living at home is up more than 10 points since the 1950s. Meanwhile, the percentage of young people married or cohabiting has almost been cut in half since 1960.That a plurality of millennials live at home is not necessarily an indictment of today's young people. It's a reflection of the way that adulthood has changed. Young people are much, much less likely to be married before 30 than they were half a century ago, and the way their lives have changed has affected where they live. The report shows increasingly stratified classes of people choosing where to live based on careers, income and education, rather than family life.From an economic perspective, it's a good thing when people pair up and form households. Marriage means shared incomes and all the purchases that come along with that (a new refrigerator, perhaps, or a washing machine, and eventually maybe a few thousand diapers). Even a young person leaving home to live with a roommate adds to the economy. So it can be worrying if a huge crop of young adults stays at home longer.But for individuals the story is more complex: real median incomes have fallen since 1999 and nearly 70 percent of college graduates are carrying debt, with the average debt load nearing $30,000. Meanwhile, rents are rising around the country as the aftershocks from the housing crisis continue to ripple through the economy. For a millennial facing a tough economy and not much societal pressure to pair off or have children, saving money by living with mom and dad makes a lot of sense. It will help them pay down their debt and be ready to contribute to the economy a decade from now.Here's a look at today's living arrangements, and how they've changed since 1880:The report shows that while an increasing amount of young people are choosing to stay at home with their parents through their 20s, for those who can afford to move out, there is also a proliferation of different living situations. They might be living alone, or with roommates, or cohabiting with a partner they aren't married to. This data shows that for those fortunate enough to be able to afford to move out, it's much more acceptable to live alone or with roommates than it was in the mid-20th century.Then there are the really fortunate: 14 percent of young people live on their own, which was virtually unheard of until about 30 or 40 years ago. They're mostly well-off professionals with college degrees, according to the report. It's much more popular to live with roommates or another family member -- included in the ""other living arrangements"" category -- than it was in the mid-20th century. (Notably this category also includes those in prison, which is its own story.) About 22 percent of young people live this way, which is about the same as it was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when young, unmarried adults, often women, flocked to the cities for factory jobs and ended up in boarding houses."

That comes out to $21 per user, according to a new report released by the Guttmacher Institute. Of the 252 million adolescent women who are sexually active in developing regions, 23 million have unmet needs for contraception, according to the report.Providing such services in the developing world would cost an estimated $7 in direct costs and $15 in indirect costs.Direct costs include contraceptives and health worker salaries, among other expenses. Indirect costs include many types of programming support, such as staff supervision and training, information and education activities.The report encouraged investing in youth centers and peer education, where adolescents can get comprehensive and “age appropriate” counseling, along with access to contraception.Scaling up contraceptive services would have sweeping health and economic advantages, according to the report.It would result in 2.4 million fewer unsafe abortions and 2.1 million fewer unplanned births.Fewer unsafe abortions means less funds spent on the associated complications.Reducing the number of unplanned births is particularly critical considering that complications due to pregnancy and childbirth are the second leading cause of death among this teenage demographic.In adolescence, pregnant women are more susceptible to developing anemia, malaria, HIV, postpartum hemorrhage and mental disorders, according to the World Health Organization. Stillbirths and death in the first week of life are also 50 percent more likely to occur to babies born to mothers younger than 20 years old than among babies born to older mothers.Adolescent childbearing is also linked to lower educational attainment, which can perpetuate the cycle of poverty.Smaller families translate into more women entering the labor force and enables governments and families to invest more in the health and education of each child.Teenagers struggle to access contraception due to a range of hindrances, misinformation and cultural barriers.Some women say they are concerned about health risks associated with contraception. They or their partners may be opposed to contraception and others say they lack access to a source.Compounding the issue is that only 49 of the 93 countries that provided information to the World Health Organization have laws and regulations that allow minor adolescents to seek contraceptive services without parental or spousal consent.""It's not enough for me to exist,"" Yemurai Nyoni, an advocate for the rights of women and girls from Zimbabwe, said at the Women Deliver conference during a session about the Guttmacher report.

There's nothing to learn,"" Corey Lewandowski said Tuesday in a feisty interview with the hosts of CBS ""This Morning.""The presumptive GOP presidential nominee has previously said he can’t release his returns because of an ongoing audit by the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS, however, has said individuals are not prohibited from sharing tax information while being audited. In fact, there's precedent for doing so. President Richard Nixon released his tax returns during an audit.In his interview with CBS, Lewandowski said that it didn't ""make any sense"" to release the information because it could change depending on the conclusion of the audit. He encouraged the press to prod the government agency into action. ""If you can get the IRS to move forward, you're better than I am,"" he said. ""Get the IRS to finish the work. You guys are the investigative journalists. You can go get it done. Get it done, and then Mr. Trump can release those taxes.""Asked about tax returns from 2002 to 2008, which have already been cleared by the IRS audit as previously disclosed by Trump's tax attorney, Lewandowski again claimed they contained nothing of interest to the general public.""There's nothing to see from 2002, 2003, and 2004,"" Lewandowski said. ""What you guys are interested right now, is what his tax rate is. His tax rate is as low as possible, as many deductions as possible, to build his business so that he could provide jobs in his corporation.""In addition to showing how much a person paid in taxes, the returns may contain information on offshore holdings, accounts, deductions and contributions to charity. In 2012, for example, Mitt Romney's offshore accounts in Switzerland and the Cayman Islands became a big issue in the presidential campaign. The former GOP presidential nominee has been one of the most vocal in calling on Trump to release his tax returns, suggesting they contained a ""bombshell"" the Manhattan real estate mogul did not wish to become public.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Thirty-seven percent want Sen. Bernie Sanders to make his exit, while 15 percent harbor the unlikelier dream of Clinton deciding to quit.The percentage who think that Sanders should drop out has risen sharply since late April, when a HuffPost/YouGov survey found that just one-fifth wanted him to go. Fifty-five percent say now that only Clinton has a real chance of becoming the nominee.Clinton's polling numbers against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump have recently dipped -- likely in part because he's clinched the GOP nomination, while the Democratic primary soldiers on. But that shift notwithstanding, Democrats still see Clinton as their stronger general election candidate. Forty percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say that only Clinton could win the presidency, while 40 percent think that either Clinton or Sanders could win, and just 14 percent think that only Sanders can win.Other recent polling has also shown Democratic primary voters largely at peace with the continuing contest between Clinton and Sanders. By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, they think a primary that lasts through June is more likely to help than hurt the party, a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey found. That's a shift from April 2008, when Democrats were more likely to worry that Clinton's candidacy was damaging the prospects for then-Sen. Barack Obama's victory.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 20 to May 23 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

He seemed candid.I thought it was very honest. This life that we live in, you have to perform to a certain level, or you’ll always be susceptible to criticism. Some people can take it well and some people can’t. When you call yourself a Superman or call yourself a great player, but then you don’t play like that, then of course everyone questions your character. I thought he handled himself well; I thought he was very eloquent in his speech. I think he’s got about four or five years left to go get [a championship], so good luck.I kind of felt the same kind of pressure before [Los Angeles Lakers coach] Phil Jackson came. I was 28, 29... I was putting up numbers, but I wasn’t winning. So I kind of know the pressure that he’s under, and you’ll never get that monkey off of your back and you’ll never get validated as a great player or as a champion until you actually win a championship.

It must bring back plenty of good (and not-so-good) memories.A lot of people liked it. There was a lot of stuff that people didn’t know was going on. It was very informative, very entertaining, and it brought back a lot of memories for us. People seem to forget that after the Bulls, me and Penny kind of brought it to the next exciting level. A lot of teams were at the same level -- your hometown team in Seattle was at that level.So we were just one of those teams that was trying to surpass the Bulls, and just trying to do what they were able to do. When I made them trade C-Webb [Chris Webber], I was thinking of the new version of Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. So when you look back at that, you’re able to see yourself and you’re so young, it's such a different time in your life. Would you have done things differently?You know, I was always taught to be firm with your decision, be strong with your decision and live with your decision. I don’t think I would have done anything different. The only thing I might have done differently is when I asked for the 150 [million]. If they had said yes, then I probably would have stayed, but when they say ""Oh he’s not worth it, we’re only going to give you 80,"" that kind of stiffened the situation a little bit.You have become quite the accomplished actor. How much do you enjoy it?It’s fun. It’s just an opportunity to have a good time. As a kid it was my dream. I can remember watching ""Superman"" and thinking I would love to be in a movie someday. Every time I get called to be on a show, I find it fun and enlightening. It keeps people interested in my personality.With that in mind, what is the hardest part for you about being on camera every day?Nothing, really, because here it’s not like the other networks, where you have to look into a camera, put on the face and broadcaster's voice. It allows us to be us. I think because of our experience and how we played and the championships that we won -- plus the humor that we add to it -- I think people really, really love our show. If I was a guy who didn’t play or a guy who didn’t win, my credibility would be questioned.Yeah, people love it because you guys are being you -- that’s why it’s different.Yes.The word is that today's NBA players are softer, that the Warriors wouldn’t win in the '90s. But if you think back to those times, one of my biggest quibbles with that is that there weren’t many European players then. Now you have great European players. Is that safe to say?There’s always going to be a fair and unfair criticism. That’s kind of how I rate players, because I always think that my era was better than any other era. Before I rate a player, I ask myself: ""Could he have played when I played? When GP [Gary Payton] and The Rain Man [Shawn Kemp] were playing? Rik Smits and Reggie Miller?""Because when I came in in '92, even in the lower markets, every team had more than respectable players, and guys played hard and fouled you hard. A lot of arenas, like going into Utah for example, were never an easy win. Going to Denver was never an easy win. But now you look at these smaller-market teams now like -- if you tell me a certain team is playing a certain team, I can tell you who’s going to win. The atmosphere is different and everything is different.What’s the hardest part about evaluating guys now? Take Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and the Warriors, thinking about how they would fare in your era -- considering the game has changed, the referees have obviously changed.There’s always one certain thing that could alter the conversation, and that would be the rule changes. Because now, people say guys like Curry could have played in my days, but then they say, no no no, you have guys like Greg Anthony who were masters of hand-checking. [Or] Rolando Blackmon and John Starks, who when they put their hands on you, they were going to drag you where they wanted you to go.So if you consider the rules, I think that can kind of alter the conversation. The way the rules are now, guys not being able to get touched, I think it gives them the freedom to do what a guy like Steph Curry is doing. I think what makes Steph Curry Steph Curry is the efficiency of his long-range shooting. You’ve seen a lot of guards who can put it between their legs, but you’ve never seen one as efficient behind that line.You played against Reggie Miller, Ray Allen. Is Curry the best shooter ever? And is it because he can handle the ball and create as well as he does?Well, this year he would be the best ever, but let’s see his next three years. I think you just have to be very consistent at what you’re doing, always got to hit the big game shot. He’s only been winning, what, four years? The last two years he’s definitely been the best shooter. Hopefully he can maintain that. What about flipping it? How would you have played in this era?Well, I would have averaged 40. I would have made a lot of guys quit. And a lot of guys would have probably said, ""Oh, well, we’re just going to push me outside."" But what you don’t understand is if you’re banging against me for three or four quarters, you’re going to be tired. Shooters need their legs to shoot, and everybody knows that. So if you go try to bang up against me, you may hit some shots in the first or second quarter, but [in the] third or fourth quarter, especially in a seven-game series, you’re definitely going to be tired.""Hack-a-Shaq"" created a controversy. Commissioner Adam Silver says a change is coming. What is the responsibility of the league -- and what should it do when it comes to the rule?I don’t think it should be changed. They didn’t change it for me, and I overcame it and won four championships. It’s part of the game. To me, from a personal standpoint, if you have to use tactics to win, then I don’t respect you as a man. Because when I was coming up, Isaiah [Thomas] beat the Bulls, the Bulls beat Utah, we beat Indiana, we beat Philly. No tactics, just 5-on-5, wrestling, fighting, clawing, flagrant fouls -- that’s how the game should be. So if you have to use an analytical tactic to win, you’ll never be a winner in my book.When you think about the league right now, is it as healthy as it should be or could be?I would like to see the smaller markets thrive a little more. With Kobe retiring, where do you think he belongs in the pantheon of greatness, and not merely for shooting guards?Guys before me and guys before us will always get the nod. I gotta go with Magic, I gotta go with Mike [Michael Jordan], and for me I always gotta go with Doctor J [Julius Erving]. And then after that you can start talking Kobe, Allen Iverson and all that. And that’s not a disrespect thing: Those guys who paved the way for us, you always got to put them first.How about the best big man of all time, then?I probably have to go with Bill Russell, because of the championships. Then Kareem, and then me.I think that’s fair. I think a lot of Lakers fans might say there might be room for you at the top.I’ll always let the people decide. I can remember when I was a youngster playing my first game. I was nervous, and my mother just said, ""Make sure they remember your name when you’re done playing.""

18,SPORTS,All Hail Bismack Biyombo!,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bismack-biyombo-nba-playoffs_us_57446e83e4b0613b512b46ef,The 2015-2016 NBA Playoffs hero we deserve.,2016-05-24,Toronto Raptors center Bismack Biyombo is called for a foul as he stops Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574471091a00008800c29766.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the more tired clichés in sports goes something like this: An athlete gets injured at a critical point in a team's season, forcing a nervous head coach to call in a lesser-known player off the bench. The player quietly, perhaps stoically steps in, knowing the people around him believe the season to be over for all intents and purposes. Then, he proceeds to do the impossible, willing his team to victory -- his team's season saved, his own life forever changed. The storyline sounds boring, lazy even -- the type of B-rate plot that has made for many an uninspired movie. But the sick, sad truth of it all is that B-rate movie plot never, ever gets old when it comes to the real world of sports. Such is the current case with Bismack Biyombo, the 23-year-old role player on the Toronto Raptors who in the last two games has earned himself millions in future NBA earnings and won over the league with his defensive prowess and ability to frustrate the superstar-laden Cleveland Cavaliers offense.Biyombo first got his shot on May 7, when Raptors starting center Jonas Valanciunas went down with a sprained right ankle in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Up until that day, Biyombo had been playing somewhere between 12 and 20 minutes per game, a solid role player for a team trying to make its first-ever appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals. Since then, Biyombo has more than made up for Valanciunas' absence, regularly playing north of 30 minutes a game and terrifying opposing offenses, averaging 15.5 rebounds and 3.25 blocks per game in the team's four subsequent victories. Last week, the Raptors found themselves down 0-1 in the the Eastern Conference Finals with Game 2 was just hours away. At that moment, the Congolese Biyombo decided to let the world know that he feared lions, not humans. And especially not LeBron James. The quip might have seemed silly initially, especially after Toronto went on to lose Game 2 by almost 20 points. But if anyone doubted Biyombo's fearlessness in the hours between the end of Game 2 and the start of Game 3, those doubts vanquished soon thereafter. With his team down 0-2 and on the brink of extinction, Biyombo made sure they wouldn't be humiliated again. He was everywhere on the court, causing constant chaos while pulling down 26 rebounds and blocking four shots on the way to an unexpected 15-point victory, even employing a Mutombo-esque finger wag after swatting a layup attempt by Kyrie Irving. Biyombo had arrived, and he was afraid of lions, not humans. It would have been understandable on the face of it all if people saw Game 3 as a wonderful blip in time, but digging into Biyombo's statistics, it was really more of an inevitability given his increased minutes. In the regular season, Biyombo was already among the best around the glass in his limited opportunities, ranking 15th in defensive rating (ahead of Al Horford and Paul George), fifth in both defensive rebound percentage and total rebound percentage (ahead of the likes of Dwight Howard, DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gobert) and second in block percentage (only behind the fear-inducing Hassan Whiteside).As of Tuesday afternoon, Biyombo had also pulled down the most rebounds of any player in the NBA playoffs and the third-most blocks. Both those statistics are inflated because the Raptors' first two playoff series went to seven games, but even when we consider the total number of opportunities he had to pull down boards and block shots, Biyombo fares well: third in total rebounding percentage among players who played more than 80 minutes in the playoffs, and eighth in block percentage with the same minutes qualification, while floating among the top 10 to 15 players in terms of defensive rating. Given that context, we shouldn't have been surprised when Biyombo came back in Game 4 and did it again, tossing up 14 rebounds and three more blocks. Still, it is hard not to be shocked by just how dominating Biyombo has become in the paint area. He has pulled down roughly 80 percent of the rebounds he has had a chance to grab in the past two games (that's a lot), and has altered shot after Cleveland shot. On Monday night, people understandably focused on Biyombo's beautiful block of James during the closing seconds of the second quarter, which officials called a foul much to the chagrin of Jeff Van Gundy. But Biyombo's presence was on view the entire night, and not just on plays in which the team didn't score ...... but on plays in which they did score, too. James, of course, is one of the most gifted basketball players the world has ever seen. But even he is showing signs that Biyombo is worrying him around the rim. James' twisting layup went in, a result of his generational skill around the basket. But Biyombo changed that shot from a dunk to something much more likely to rim out: a last-second flick of the wrist. That doesn't count as a block, and Cleveland scored two points. But Cleveland made similar adjustments throughout the night when Biyombo was in, and when you're playing the percentages against one of the best offenses on earth, those small changes could end up altering the game in your favor down the stretch. The Raptors as a team have done what most people thought was impossible: They have tied the Cavaliers at two games apiece and made the Eastern Conference entertaining. With all due respect to the team's two All-Star players, DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry, that's Biyombo's doing. You better believe the free agent-to-be is going to get paid this offseason. There's going to be quite a lot of money out there for people who fear lions, not LeBron James. "

One hundred had been born prematurely, weighing less than 1 kg, while the other 89 had weighed more than 2.5 kg. All participants completed standardized questionnaires on health, education, employment, social integration, sexuality and reproduction.More than half of each group were women. One in five of those born premature had neurologic impairments.In their mid-20s, the two groups had similar life circumstances and achievement, and at ages 29 to 36, educational achievement and family and partner relationships were still similar - but fewer premature adults were employed or employed full time.On average, the premature group was making $20,000 less per year than the term group.Half of the premature group was never married or single, compared to about a third of the full-term group, and 20 percent had never experienced sexual intercourse compared to 2 percent of the term group, as reported in JAMA Pediatrics, May 23.Neurological disabilities explain some of the differences, but personality differences also play a role, Saigal said.“Overall the majority were educated, living independently, employed, contributing to society,” but those born very premature tended not to be “go-getters” as much as those born at term, she said.More adults in the premature group also reported being homosexual or bisexual than in the term group, although it’s not clear why that would be and the sample of people in this study was relatively small, she said.Most of the difference came from individuals in the low birth weight group identifying as bisexual, said Peter Anderson of Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, who was not part of the new study.The study “has provided enormous insights into our understanding of how these infants transition through childhood to adolescence to adulthood,” Anderson told Reuters Health by email. “The results are predominantly positive given their vulnerability at birth.”“Hopefully children born today should do equally well if not better than children born earlier,” given advancements in neonatal care, Saigal said. “The majority of times we do not know why infants are born this early.”(This story has been refiled to replace the headline)SOURCE: bit.ly/1qEVV5rJAMA Pediatr 2016."

She won Jefferson County, which includes Louisville and is the largest by far of the state's 120 counties, by nearly 10 times that amountIn his filing on Tuesday, Sanders requested a full check and recanvass of every voting machine and absentee ballot from all precincts in the counties, according to Grimes' website.""My office is notifying all county boards of elections that Sen.

She used it to handle both official and personal message traffic when she was Secretary of State.The two sources said the U.S. investigation of Lazar turned up no evidence to support thehacker's claims that he had broken into Clinton's private server. Its contents and operations are the focus of an FBI investigation.Lazar's public defender, Shannon Quill, did not respond to a request for comment.In an interview with NBC News before his extradition from Romania, Lazar claimed that Clinton's private server ""was like an open orchid on the internet.""Clinton, law enforcement and national security officials have said there is no evidence that Guccifer or any other unauthorized or outside party breached Clinton's private server.None of the State Department-related message traffic that moved through the private server when Clinton served as secretary of state was marked and treated as classified.However, among the targets of Guccifer's hacking was an AOL email account used by Sidney Blumenthal, a former Clinton White House aide and unofficial adviser.Blumenthal's lengthy memos to Clinton on foreign policy were sent to her private server. Guccifer's publication of a set of these messages led to the exposure of Clinton's unconventional email arrangement.Reviews by government departments, including two spy agencies, found that dozens of messages that moved through Clinton's private server contained classified information, including material the government later deemed top secret.But officials also said none of the classified material in Clinton's servers included whole documents copied word for word from secret government servers.(Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Cynthia Osterman)"
22,POLITICS,Federal Court Rules Ohio Voting Cutbacks Are Unconstitutional,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-voting-rights-ruling_us_5744ae37e4b055bb11707307,"""African Americans will disproportionately bear this burden,"" the judge determined.",2016-05-24,Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R) backed voting restrictions initiated by Republicans in the state legislature that took effect in 2014.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_255_3496_2097%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Ohio’s cutbacks to early voting are unconstitutional and violate the Voting Rights Act because they give African-Americans “less opportunity to participate in the political process compared to other voters” in past elections.In 2014, Ohio’s Republican-controlled legislature eliminated in-person early voting on the weekends and during weekdays after 5pm. It also passed a law that ended “Golden Week,” a period of time in which Ohioans could both register and vote on the same day. Golden Week was created in 2005 as a response to the hours-long lines of the 2004 presidential election, when tens of thousands of would-be voters left their polling places in frustration without casting their ballots.Judge Michael H. Watson -- who was appointed by President George W. Bush -- ruled that ""the elimination of the extra days for [early in-person] voting provided by Golden Week will disproportionately burden African Americans,"" citing expert and anecdotal evidence. He added that being forced to vote on another day or on Election Day would simply result in longer lines.“African Americans will disproportionately bear this burden, because … they have greater time and resource limitations that may prevent them from waiting in line on Election Day and are less likely to vote absentee,” he wrote. “The opportunity for [same-day registration] during Golden Week alleviated the costs to voters of having to register and vote at separate times,” Watson added. “Indeed, it may be more difficult for voters with time, resource, transportation, and childcare restraints to make two separate trips to register and vote, and Golden Week allowed individuals to do both at once.”In April 2015, the American Civil Liberties Union and NAACP reached a deal to settle a previous lawsuit against Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R). The deal restored one day of Sunday voting and more evening hours on weekdays, but Golden Week was not reinstated. Soon after, the Ohio Democratic Party and Ohio voters filed a new lawsuit against the state, arguing that the early voting cutbacks and other restrictions on voting disproportionately burdened racial minorities and young people, because the state legislature knew that those groups are more likely to take advantage of the early voting period.The plaintiffs' representative was Marc Elias, a Democratic campaign finance and voting rights lawyer who also represents presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Elias, bankrolled in part by the billionaire philanthropist George Soros, is involved in other lawsuits over voting restrictions passed by legislatures in Wisconsin, Arizona, Virginia and North Carolina.While Republicans say cutbacks to early voting and the elimination of same-day registration in states like Ohio and North Carolina are meant to prevent voter fraud, the court noted that “actual instances of voter fraud during Golden Week are extremely rare.” It’s difficult for plaintiffs to prove that legislative actions meant to damage Democrats’ chances and those meant to restrict racial minorities' access to the polls are one and the same. The court avoided making that determination.“It requires too much speculation to find that the historical background of the challenged decisions or the sequence of events preceding the state action show a racial motivation,” Watson wrote. “Indeed, Plaintiffs seem to argue more that it was Democratic successes in 2008, rather than racial bias, that prompted the General Assembly and Secretary Husted to take the challenged actions.”In a statement, Husted praised other parts of the judge’s ruling that upheld state policies regarding the number of electronic voting machines and early voting locations in each county, as well as changes to the state’s absentee vote-by-mail program. “While I am pleased the court has upheld existing law on nearly every issue, it is disappointing that a federal judge would again change the election rules after the current laws were upheld in the same federal district court by a settlement agreement we reached with the NAACP and the ACLU,” Husted said. “This point is further amplified when you consider that, for nearly 200 years, Ohioans voted for only one day. If it was constitutional for lawmakers to expand the voting period to 35 days, it must also be constitutional for the same legislative body to amend the timeframe to 28 days, a timeframe that remains one of the most generous in the nation.” The state said it would appeal the ruling to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday. Since another federal court upheld North Carolina’s cutbacks to early voting and elimination of same-day registration, the Supreme Court could eventually take up one of these cases if the 6th Circuit upholds Watson's ruling. The Supreme Court’s conservative wing displayed skepticism about federal voting rights legislation when it struck down a key section of the landmark Voting Rights Act in 2013, so there are high stakes for the lawsuits in Ohio, North Carolina and elsewhere. The Voting Rights Act provision required states and localities with a history of voting discrimination to get federal permission to change their voting laws. The VRA still bars voting procedures that discriminate against racial minorities under Section 2 -- the provision at issue in the Ohio suit -- but the strength of that section hasn’t since been tested at the Supreme Court.

23,POLITICS,Time Is Running Out For The Senate To Finally Do Something About Sentencing Reform,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/criminal-justice-reform-senate_us_5744ba18e4b055bb11707faa,"The bipartisan legislation, which would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenders, is waiting to be brought up for a vote.",2016-05-24,Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (third from left) is irritated Senate Republicans have not brought up criminal justice reform legislation for a vote.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5744ba8a1300000105382a66.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Senators pushing for bipartisan criminal justice reform are running out of time to pass the legislation through both chambers before the election year’s long summer recess begins.If lawmakers don’t find a way to move the bill before they leave in July, the chances of it passing this year dwindle significantly. The legislation would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenders and give judges greater discretion when issuing sentences for low-level drug crimes.Still, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), who helped author the Senate package, said Tuesday that he and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) are waiting for the House to move first. Cornyn wouldn’t say whether the two lawmakers had talked to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who dictates what comes to the floor, about the latest version of the bill.“I think right now the best prospects for us are for the House to start,” Cornyn said, adding that he and Grassley spoke to House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) two weeks ago about the matter. Goodlatte is hoping his criminal justice package will come to the floor and pass in June, Cornyn said. “That I think will give us some momentum over here,” he said.So far, the House Judiciary Committee has pushed through a slew of criminal justice bills, but no floor time has been arranged by Republican leaders for the package despite the interest they have expressed in passing it. When asked about the bill's prospects, Goodlatte referred HuffPost to his press office, which didn't immediately respond.Jessica Collins, a spokesperson for the House Judiciary Committee, didn't comment on the June timeframe, but said the committee is still pushing forward on its criminal justice reform package. ""The committee still plans to address a few remaining issues: policing strategies, improved criminal procedures, and juvenile justice,"" Collins said.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), co-author of the criminal justice reform bill, voiced irritation Tuesday with Cornyn and Grassley for not pushing McConnell harder to bring the bill up for a vote. “I’m very concerned, I want to talk to both of them today to find out what they’ve done,” Durbin said. “We’ve done everything we’ve been asked to do: passed it out of committee 15-5, made significant changes in the bill, drew additional Republican co-sponsors, and still no signal from Sen. McConnell that he would even consider calling it to the floor.”Durbin didn’t like the idea of the upper chamber waiting for the House to move first, saying the Senate is waiting on the House on too many bills.In an interview with The Huffington Post earlier this month, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), another author of the text, said he was growing frustrated with the lack of urgency. If Congress waits until after summer recess, Booker said, passing the bill, which he called ""the first reversal of mass incarceration in the federal level"" in his lifetime, would be extremely difficult. The Senate is scheduled to adjourn July 15 and reconvene in September, at which point it is scheduled to be in session just 43 days through the end of the year.Late last month, proponents of the bill unveiled changes to the text, strengthening language applying to violent offenders to win over more Republicans and convince McConnell it has enough votes for passage. But after finalizing the latest revisions and announcing the new co-sponsors, talk of votes on the package has all but stopped in the Senate -- an indication that McConnell hasn't warmed to the idea. “There comes a point where we’re ready to go, and I don’t know why we’d be waiting on the House at this point,” Durbin said. This story has been updated to include comment from Collins."

Bernie Sanders campaigning in Los Angeles on Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5743a31f1600002a00f9440e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In a move meant to cool down tensions between his campaign and the Democratic establishment, the Democratic Party will give Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) a greater role to play in establishing its platform at this summer's Democratic National Convention.Under an agreement the party reached with Sanders and opponent Hillary Clinton, Sanders can select five people to serve on the party's platform committee, a third of the committee's members. Clinton will name six members, and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), the party chair, will name four, according to the Washington Post.Typically, the chair names all 15 members to the committee, which sets the party's agenda and guiding principles at the convention in July. This year's change is a concession to the Sanders campaign, which has accused the party of rigging the nominating rules against him and is concerned the party will ignore Sanders' progressive policy proposals with Clinton as the nominee.Though Clinton leads Sanders in the delegate count and is expected to clinch the nomination when the primaries wrap up next month, the Vermont senator and his supporters hope his influence on the party will continue and he'll bring the progressive movement he has built to the general election. ""We believe that we will have the representation on the platform drafting committee to create a Democratic platform that reflects the views of millions of our supporters who want the party to address the needs of working families in this country and not just Wall Street, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry and other powerful special interests,"" Sanders said in a statement.Among the five members Sanders is expected to name to the committee are environmental activist Bill McKibben; Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus; and James Zogby, a DNC member and pro-Palestine activist.Democratic leaders want to ensure that Sanders can unite his supporters around the party's general election efforts, as tensions between the party and the Sanders campaign have boiled over in recent weeks.Earlier this month, Sanders supporters attacked Democratic leaders in Nevada over the party's delegate procedures. On Saturday, Sanders announced his endorsement of Wasserman Schultz's progressive challenger, Tim Canova. And some supporters have said they will not back Clinton as the nominee, creating a larger gulf between his campaign and the party, and potentially jeopardizing Democrats' chances at winning the White House in November.Sanders has vowed to stay in the race through the convention in July and is campaigning heavily in California ahead of its primary on June 7. Despite some Democrats calling his decision to keep up his fight a ""scorched earth"" approach, Clinton on Sunday said that he has the right to continue his campaign.“Senator Sanders has every right to finish off his campaign however he chooses,” she said.Sanders acknowledged that his chances at the nomination are slim, but reiterated on Sunday that he hopes to make his mark on the party's platform. He argued that Clinton will ""have her problems"" if she doesn't make concessions to the progressive movement.""I don’t want to see the American people voting for the lesser of two evils,"" Sanders told ABC. ""I want the American people to be voting for a vision of economic justice, of social justice, of environmental justice, of racial justice."""

Money predicts more substantial, liquidation-level bargains won't begin until the end of summer, as the August deadline approaches.While the sales will take care of Sports Authority's physical merchandise, the company's brand and intellectual property will be sold separately, reports the Denver Business Journal.The fate of the Sports Authority Field at Mile High, home of the Denver Broncos, remains unclear. The company assumed naming rights in 2011, but fans overwhelmingly prefer the arena lose its corporate sponsorship entirely and revert back to the original ""Mile High Stadium.""The decline of Sports Authority mirrors a broader decline in brick-and-mortar retail stores, as online shops have cannibalized their sales.“It seems like every retail industry is dealing with its own set of challenges,’’ Katie Nemec, spokeswoman for the National Sporting Goods Association, told USA Today. “I certainly don’t think the sporting goods industry is the only one.’’In March, Reuters reported that Sports Authority had taken on more than $1 billion in debt. The company missed a $21 million interest payment earlier in the year. An initial turnaround attempt, involving the closure of 140 stores and distribution centers in Denver and Chicago, was unsuccessful.Private equity group Leonard Green & Partners LP purchased Sports Authority in 2006 for $1.3 billion.Rival Dick's Sporting goods welcomed the news, as many of its locations compete with Sports Authority. Bloomberg notes Dick's isn't expected to see an uptick in sales until the second half of 2016, however, as Sports Authority's liquidation will initially overwhelm the market with cheaper merchandise.Dick's CEO Ed Stack said last week the company is considering taking over a small number of the locations vacated by Sports Authority.""Although it’s a mess, it’s a great opportunity for Dick’s Sporting Goods,” Stack told analysts on the company's earnings call. “There is a small group of stores that we would love to get.""

Donors to the apparatus may contribute far larger amounts than in previous elections -- up to $450,000 apiece. (Likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton struck a similar agreement with the Democratic National Committee.)But Trump has boasted, time and time again, about self-funding his campaign. It is one of his most popular lines among his supporters. Moreover, he has repeatedly accused his rivals of being beholden to billionaires, special interests and lobbyists simply by taking their money.During a February speech in New Hampshire, Trump suggested that Johnson, who was born to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical family, would impede Bush from renegotiating Medicare drug prices, as Trump has promised to do.NBC reported:Trump predicted Jeb Bush would avoid taking on the issue as president because Woody Johnson, whose family founded Johnson & Johnson, served as his campaign chairman.The same Johnson is now working for Trump in a similar role.In an interview with the Associated Press, Trump denied the contradiction between his earlier campaign promises and the new fundraising effort because he is ""raising money for the party.""That's simply not the case. As the AP noted, the terms of the agreement stipulate that the first $5,400 of every check raised goes to Trump's primary and general election accounts. The rest goes to the RNC and 11 state parties. Moreover, even though the RNC will use the money it receives toward electing House and Senate candidates, it also spends a significant amount of time and resources on voter identification and turnout for the presidential election -- efforts that will surely benefit Trump.Trump spun the fundraising arrangement as something that was put upon him by the RNC, one that he only agreed to reluctantly. ""The RNC really wanted to do it, and I want to show good spirit,"" Trump told the AP. ""'Cause I was very happy to continue to go along the way I was.""Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S. "
30,POLITICS,These States Are Stepping Up To Reform Money In Politics In 2016,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-campaign-finance-reform_us_57449f87e4b0b14fc0e64565,Voters in South Dakota and Washington state will get to decide.,2016-05-24,Voters in Washington state will have the chance to clean big money out of politics this fall.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5744a00e1a00002f00c297e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The next front in the battle for campaign finance and lobbying reforms will likely be on the ballot in Washington state and South Dakota in November. Activists there have either succeeded or are well on their way to securing ballot positions for omnibus reform initiatives to change the states’ campaign finance, lobbying and ethics laws.The two ballot initiatives mark the continuation of a strategy pursued by national reform groups like Represent.Us, the principal mover behind the Washington and South Dakota initiatives, and Every Voice to take the issue of money in politics directly to voters in states and municipalities across the country. They are also joined by the conservative reform group Take Back Our Republic.“If we can win a few states in November, there will be a strong message that voters are taking matters into their own hands on this issue, and that it is the beginning of a similar dynamic that advanced gay marriage and other movements that were driven from the states to Washington, D.C.,” Josh Silver, executive director of Represent.Us, told The Huffington Post.Represent.Us has worked with bipartisan partners in Washington and South Dakota to pursue this goal. In Washington, co-chairs of the Integrity Washington campaign for I-1464 include leaders from the League of Women Voters, which leans liberal, and the Seattle Tea Party Patriots, which doesn't. In South Dakota, the Yes On 22 campaign is chaired by the Republican former state Sen. Don Frankenfeld and Democratic ex-state Rep. Darrell Solberg.The bipartisan nature of these reform efforts is essential to their passage and acceptance, according to those involved.“South Dakota is a Republican state, and that’s one of the reasons that we are holding this initiative vote,"" Frankenfeld said. ""If it can be successful in a Republican and quite conservative state, we hope that will be a signal to other states, and to the federal government, to make constructive changes.""As part of the effort to achieve bipartisan consensus, the initiatives in Washington and South Dakota bundle together a number of issues, including ethics reform, lobbying reform, transparency policies and public financing of elections. These are carefully tailored to policies that have a broader ideological acceptance.Take the public financing system proposed in both initiatives. The idea is to create a system of “democracy vouchers,” providing each registered voter with a certain number of $50 credits to use as campaign contributions to candidates who choose to participate in the publicly funded system. The “democracy voucher” method, which was adopted by popular ballot in Seattle in 2015, seems to appeal to conservatives, as it puts the power to fund candidates in the hands of individual voters and not through lump-sum government payments to political campaigns.The people leading the initiative campaigns in both states noted that their desire to pursue these reforms stems from their states’ respective poor grades in the Center for Public Integrity’s annual State Integrity investigation. The nonprofit’s ranking system examines state transparency, ethics and government accountability laws. Washington received a D+ last year, while South Dakota was one of 11 states that received an F. (Alaska, which scored a C, was the best-rated state on the list.)Peter McCollum, campaign manager for the Integrity Washington ballot initiative campaign, called the D+ grade “a slap in the face for people in Washington"" and a sign that ""there were some big holes that needed to be addressed.”Washington and South Dakota probably won't be the only states with money-in-politics reform initiatives on the ballot in 2016. Idaho looks like it will have an ethics reform initiative. In Arizona, voters will likely be able to vote for an initiative that will shore up the state’s public financing system and increase transparency of undisclosed “dark” money. Voters in Florida's Miami-Dade County will be able to vote on an initiative to reform the municipality's campaign finance and lobbying laws while also creating a public financing system that would match small-dollar donations with public funds.“These organizations and leaders know that they are charting a new story on the issue of money in politics,” said David Donnelly, president and CEO of Every Voice. “It’s a story that won’t be about super PACs, it will be about citizens. It won’t be about billionaires. It will be about ballot initiatives.”"
