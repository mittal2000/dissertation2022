It is also a great opportunity to not just be singularly focused with our gratitude for the holidays, but to find ways to integrate appreciation for ourselves and others into our everyday. Check out these simple steps and try one or all and experience the goodness a little gratitude can bring.1. Morning: Wake up and say thank you. Try to let the first thought in the morning be about gratitude and literally thinking silently or saying out loud ""thank you."" It doesn't have to be about anything specific (but it can be). By simply opening your day with this sentiment, you invite gratitude in for the rest of the day.2. Mid-Day: Practice random acts of kindness. This can be something simple like letting someone in during traffic or the popular act of buying a cup of coffee for the next person in line. Or putting a post it note on your loved one or co-worker's space letting them know they are loved or valued. Sure you can do the grander gestures, but just check in to make sure you are coming from a simple place of giving and not looking for recognition (seeking validation is a good sign that our good ole' ego is at work).3. Evening: Keep a gratitude log. This is a great evening activity to either keep on your phone or simply write down three things you are grateful for in your day. You can write anything that comes to mind or you can choose to write an item of gratitude towards a loved one, another for a person you may be experiencing some difficulty with, and the final towards yourself.   Bonus: Practice a loving kindness meditation. Simply email hello@soulsparks.com to receive a direct link to a guided meditation.

""But ... the terrorists only have to be lucky once.""Planned new measures include giving police the power to seize for up to 30 days the passports of British and foreign nationals suspected of traveling to take part in terrorist-related activities, said May.The new laws will also make it easier for police to identify who is using an Internet service at any given time.London's top police officer on Sunday said authorities are increasingly worried about a ""lone wolf""-style attack and have foiled four or five plots this year.On Monday, Mark Rowley, Britain's top counter-terrorism officer, said police were ""stretched"" but had stepped up their efforts, making 271 arrests this year. Warning the threat would remain high for several years, he said the public's help was needed in spotting potential attackers.Around half of Britons traveling to Syria are newly radicalized and not previously known to police, Rowley said.""I would never use the word inevitable but of course ... terrorists do sometimes succeed,"" he added. ""We are going to do everything we possibly can do to stop that happening.""Britain raised its terrorism alert to the second-highest level in August, saying an attack was now ""highly likely.""

More often than not, he and his lawyers merely sign management contracts with a clause requiring him to drop by once a year to see if he recognizes anyone in the kitchen. And, if the restaurant goes belly up, ah well, he didn't put any of his money into it anyway. Most truly dedicated chefs will still spend as much time as possible in their original restaurant in order to maintain its signature luster. In that category I place Charlie Palmer, whose rise from a cook to a chef to a restaurateur and now even to a hotelier has been marked by consistent attention to his 26-year-old NYC flagship, Aureole, and to Dry Creek Kitchen in Healdsburg, CA, where he and his family live. Palmer has not chosen to become a clown on television--that irresistible magnet for ego-mad chefs who spend far more time on location than in any of their far-flung kitchens. Palmer has opened a series of steakhouses in DC, Las Vegas and Reno, of a kind that don't really require the kind of constant, hands-on attention that a fine dining room like Aureole does. Thus, Palmer's opening of a namesake steakhouse in NYC seems a safe bet for both him and his company; for the New Yorker who can go to any of a dozen of the finest steakhouses in America, ""CPS"" is now yet another option to compare one with the other. The night I dined there, Palmer had just gotten off a plane from California and rushed over to check in on his newest enterprise, located on East 54th Street, replacing Rothmann's Steakhouse.  The transformed 80-seat dining room is handsome and deliberately breaks from the clichés of old-school steakhouse design. There's good lighting, iridescent colors, artwork, textures of stainless steel mesh, glass, and tweed. Odd, though, that it is the only one of Palmer's steakhouses that eschews tablecloths, when tablecloths are ubiquitous in high-end competitors in NYC like Luger, Sparks, Palm, BLT, Smith & Wollensky, Porter House, Strip House, and newcomers like Davio's, NYY Steak, Il Mulino Prime, and Costata. By comparison, the (albeit pretty) wooden tables with placemats at CPS more resemble the look of a casual café.  Otherwise, this new Palmer entry has a service staff without a scintilla of the brashness of so many others, and there's a briskness--but never a rush--about how guests are taken care of.  Thanks to wine director Peter Bothwell, the wine list, as at all Palmer's restaurants, is first rate.  Brooklyn-born, Jersey-raised exec chef Matthew Zappoli breaks none of the traditions of steakhouse menus here, instead content to find the very finest ingredients possible and to treat them with respect by not altering their essential flavors. You don't find sea urchin butter on your sirloin here, or bottarga on your fried potatoes.  What you will find is one of the most generous shellfish platters, piled high with lobster, oysters, clams, shrimp, crab claws, and Alaskan King crab ($38 per person). The tuna tartare ($21) takes on dimensions from a citrus ponzu and pickled ginger with sesame crackers, while yellowtail sashimi ($20) at the right temperature comes atop a salt block (above) with piment d'espelette, lime and shallots. Foie gras is blended with chicken into a rich, creamy pâté ($19), served with sweet fig chutney and crostini.  Because of his clout, Palmer obtains the finest meats in the American market, and you won't easily find a better, juicier bone-in ribeye of Angus beef ($54). One section is devoted to ""dry-aged 30 days"" beef, including a porterhouse for two ($109) and a cut called ""teres major"" ($28), a thick rounded strip of beef from near the scapula of the steer. It is almost as tender as filet mignon but has much more flavor. It's not a cut you'll find often on menus, but one I hope more steakhouses will add. There are also three Kobe steaks--two American ($58 and $62), one Japanese ($162).  Thirty-days of dry aging is just on the cusp of that point where beef can become livery; beyond that it can get downright funky. (Those chefs--not Palmer--who pride themselves on 56-, 75-, and 128-day aging are doing it for the record book, not taste.) A bone-in New York strip ($56) did not have the sumptuous flavor I expect.  It is obvious when a master chef applies his knowledge beyond the grill to the side dishes, for CPS's are outstanding, including Yukon Gold mashed potatoes ($9) and creamed spinach ($9). Same goes for desserts, like the chocolate cake with warm caramel and milk chocolate ice cream ($11), and the peach cobbler with cinnamon streusel ($11), though the cheesecake pudding ($11) needs a bit of re-thinking.  Prices at CPS are pretty much in line with its competition. What you get at CPS is the personalized style of one of NYC's finest chefs, as opposed to multi-unit corporate managers.

""I've got to admit initially, even though I felt that it was the right time to stop, there was always a bit of me going, 'Oh, go on ... Let's do another,'"" Bale told the magazine. ""So when I heard there was someone else doing it, there was a moment where I just stopped and stared into nothing for half an hour."" Yes, Batman stared into nothingness, contemplating the realization that his cape was forever hung up.But one word Bale used to describe the casting stands out: ""The fact that I'm jealous of someone else playing Batman,"" Bale said. ""I think I should have gotten over it by now."" That must mean Bale has been jealous since the news was first announced, although interviews from last year would show otherwise.Last November, while promoting ""Out of the Furnace,"" Bale seemed unaffected by the news, telling ""Access Hollywood"" that he wished Affleck the best. Bale clearly has a really good poker face, but if you look closely, you can see his bat heart slowly crumbling inside. H/T Comic Book Movie"

Let's hope that the United States doesn't take his bait, and inadvertently prop him back up by giving him a military enemy to fight against.",2014-11-24,"Russian President Vladimir Putin reacts during a press conference after talks with his Serbian counterpart Tomislav Nikolic in Belgrade, Serbia, Thursday, Oct. 16, 2014. Putin arrived on a one-day official visit to Serbia during which he will attend a military parade commemorating 70th anniversary of Belgrades liberation from Nazi occupation. (AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14164240000360076f108.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to provoke a military confrontation with the West. His military jets have repeatedly buzzed NATO facilities, coming close to causing a crash with a Swedish civilian airliner. He has vowed to extend the range of those patrols to the Gulf of Mexico. After he took credit for initiating the September 5 ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, the rebels he supports have done everything they can to undermine it. Monitoring drones from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (a neutral group where Russia is a member) have been repeatedly shot at or jammed on the Russian border. Recently Putin broke the truce definitively, sending columns of unmarked military trucks, heavy weapons, and ""little green men"" into Donetsk, according to NATO.Putin's actions have gone beyond simply reasserting Russia's great power status. He is goading the United States to take a more militarized approach to the crisis -- much as in 2008 his threatening actions provoked Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to directly enter the conflict in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. His timing coincides with the return of hardline Republicans to majority control in the U.S. Senate, where they can push through pending legislation to send lethal weapons to Ukraine. While some pundits portray the Ukraine crisis as a victory for Putin, all he has really gained is impoverished and destroyed territory, and the responsibility for feeding and supporting its largely unemployed residents. The truth is that Putin has nothing left to lose. U.S. and European support for the sanctions regime is rock-solid, defying predictions that sanctions wouldn't hold. Sanctions are already taking a bite out of the Russian oil industry, the engine that drives Putin's regime. Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer headed by Putin's close associate Igor Sechin, can't get western bank financing or the technical assistance it needs for further Arctic oil exploration and development. It has asked Putin for a $49 billion bailout -- a striking request from a company that bragged in 2012 that it was the biggest taxpayer in Russia. And that was before crude oil prices fell below $80 a couple of weeks ago. On top of this, the October 26 elections in Ukraine demonstrated that Putin has lost the influence Russia used to have in Kiev's politics. Pro-Russian political parties did abysmally, with only one clearing the threshold needed for representation in the parliament. This severely limits Putin's ability to strike a deal favorable to himself with the Ukrainian leadership. Military action is one of the few tools he has left in Ukraine. Putin needs to rile up ever more patriotic fervor to keep his support levels high as the Russian economy tanks. And the best way to do that is to provoke Washington into taking some kind of military step against Russia. Putin needs an enemy to divert Russian attention from what is happening at home.The worst thing the U.S. could do in these circumstances is to give Putin what he wants. If identifiably U.S.-supplied weapons were to be used in a fight against Russian ""volunteers"" in eastern Ukraine, that would give Putin an excuse for direct escalation against Washington -- perhaps by targeting U.S. allies in the Baltics, or U.S. industrial cyber-resources, or even U.S. citizens located in Russia. The more desperate Putin feels about his historical legacy, the less likely he is to care about the dangerous consequences that could result. Putin is like a gambler on a losing streak: the more his losses pile up, the more risks he will take to try to win.Additional military support from the U.S. is not going to save Ukraine from Russia. Kiev's military organization is riddled by corruption, and by Russian agents. Ukraine lacks the strength as a state to stop the Russian military machine from marching forward if that's what Putin wants to do. Weapons won't change that, especially as Putin takes bigger and bigger risks every day. Many decades ago the dean of U.S. Cold War diplomats, George F. Kennan, argued that the best way to defeat the Soviet regime was to take away its enemy image of the United States. When authoritarian regimes have no external threat to fight against, they have a hard time justifying their existence to their people. Eventually they fall from their own weight. Kennan regretted that the U.S. unnecessarily militarized the Cold War, which in his view prolonged the Soviet regime. Putin's post-Soviet regime may be approaching a crucial tipping point in its level of domestic support. Let's hope that the United States doesn't take his bait, and inadvertently prop him back up by giving him a military enemy to fight against."

But since the Babylonians invaded Jerusalem in 586 B.C., most Jews have lived outside of Israel.Today, Diaspora Jews, as they are called, account for 8 million of the approximately 13 million Jews worldwide; the remaining 5 million live in Israel.Alan Wolfe, director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College, ponders this split in his newly-released book “At Home in Exile: Why Diaspora Is Good for the Jews.”In the Diaspora, writes Wolfe, Jewish life can more easily embrace universalism — applying Jewish values to make the world a better place, for Jews and non-Jews alike. In contrast, “Jewish particularism” describes the defensive, inward posture of Jews in Israel.“As it increasingly becomes clear that the Diaspora is not a disaster and that the security offered by statehood has proven to be precarious, the lost universalism that has been so much a part of Jewish tradition may well be prepared for a comeback, this time on firmer soil,” Wolfe writes in his introduction.Some readers and critics have responded with a collective “duh” to Wolfe’s assertion that Diaspora is good for the Jews. And they take issue with his “particular” vs. “universal” approach to Judaism.Yes, the Jews of the Diaspora for most of history lived in danger. Centuries ago, the Jewish population of Europe was forced into ghettos and killed in pogroms. Only two generations ago, the Holocaust wiped out most of Europe’s Jews, convincing the U.N. that the survivors could not live safely in the Diaspora and should be granted a state of their own.But today most Diaspora Jews live in North America, where they feel safe and free and take pride in their contributions to the societies that have accepted them.“Even the staunchest American Zionists do not claim that Jews cannot live secure, authentic, fulfilling lives in the United States,” wrote Peter Beinart in his review of Wolfe’s book in The New York Times. “To the contrary, America’s most prominent Zionists — people like Alan M. Dershowitz, Abraham H. Foxman and William Kristol — also tend to be passionate believers in America’s hospitability to the Jews.”Speaking at a book talk at Washington’s Brookings Institution on Tuesday (Nov. 18), Wolfe agreed that the terms “particularist” and “universalist” are undefinable, overlapping and, in general, “hopeless.”But he added that he still finds them useful: “There really are two basic different kinds of Judaism that have persevered throughout Jewish history since the Book of Deuteronomy was written.”One type of Jew sees the dispersal of Jews around the world as God’s punishment. The other sees the Diaspora as a positive thing, “because a relatively enlightened religion associated with Judaism can be spread to the world as a whole, and not just confined to the Jewish people.”The Holocaust and the creation of Israel in 1948 turned the tide toward the particularist vision, but it’s time to turn the tide again, Wolfe argued, and this will benefit Jews and non-Jews alike, both inside and outside Israel.Yehuda Kurtzer, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America, which studies issues facing Israel and the Jews worldwide, found much to praise when called upon to critique the book at the Brookings discussion. He admired Wolfe for standing up to those who consider Jewish life outside Israel less authentic, and for calling out Diaspora Jews who use their devotion to Israel as a shortcut to developing a more full and meaningful Jewish identity.But Kurtzer said it was simplistic to suggest that Zionism is particular and parochial and the Diaspora is universal and moral, and he argued that for all Jews, looking deeply into Judaism and its moral teachings is the key to embracing others — the universalism for which Wolfe seems to long. He pointed to the Bible, which starts with God creating not a Jew, but a person, and later charges Abraham and Jewish people to be an example to others.“This moral challenge,” Kurtzer said, “runs through particularism and not around it.”"

Children are witnessing the trauma of such clashes, especially that many young children have been seen at demonstrations and there have been disturbing reports of some groups deliberately bringing in vulnerable children. Some reports suggest that certain political organizations are offered money in exchange for sending street children into a demonstration area. He said violence against children was tied to poverty, unemployment, drugs, inadequate or abusive parenting practices and real-life adult models of violent problem-solving behavior.Saleh's views in ""Young People, Media and Health: Risks and Rights,"" are unnerving. Young People Media & Health (Abu-Fadil)His observations dovetail with a video clip seemingly shot with a mobile phone of a private tutor in English slapping a boy around for not getting his lesson right.The teacher called the boy ""hiyawan"" (Arabic for animal), in this context a moron, while another boy in the room looked on and laughed. The recipient of the blows also laughed at first before telling his instructor he'd had enough and asking him to stop.The comments by Egyptian viewers on the video clip's YouTube page were rather telling. Screen shot of Egyptian boy ducking from abusive private tutor's blowsMost found the boy's attitude ""asal"" (meaning honey, or adorable) and the incident comical, albeit the boy ""ghabi"" (dumb) for not learning his lesson properly. One viewer wrote: ""Funny videos, I'm Egyptian and I'm proud to be Egyptian.""Saleh saw links between different kinds of violence in society and the media. He shed light on whether (or not) children's rights were protected in Egypt and the role media literacy could play in addressing this societal crisis. The adverse effects of media reporting are still impeded by many social and cultural issues, are seldom recorded statistically, and, even if reported, are usually only recorded in terms of broader family incidences. Moreover, with the lack of more child rights protection, media texts and visuals will continue to recreate and disseminate violent themes and radicalism in a positively packaged culturally mediated context.He said Egypt was caught in a vicious cycle of violence against children where a paradox lies in the pseudo-culture that continues to brag about its religious and conservative structure, while keeping silent and even being disinterested in child maltreatment, peer victimization and children's exposure to violence in the family, school, community and media.Book co-editor Cecilia von Feilitzen's chapter ""Mediated Violence and Related Risk Factors"" focused on research, film and television, children's personalities and relationships, video and computer games, and violence on the Internet.""The 'UN Convention on the Rights of the Child' stresses the important function performed by the media, that the child shall have access to information and material aimed at the promotion of his or her well-being and health and that s/he shall be protected from information and material injurious to his or her well being (from Article 17),"" she wrote.The International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media published the 202-page book. The clearinghouse falls under the umbrella of Nordicom, Gothenburg University's Nordic Information Centre for Media and Communication Research in SwedenAnother chapter is a policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics' Council on Communications and Media that zeroed in on children, adolescents, obesity and the media.""It is increasingly clear that the media, particularly TV, play an important role in the etiology of obesity,"" it said, adding that there were no data relating other media to obesity. Sweet treats (Abu-Fadil)The statement said children and teenagers who watch more TV tend to consume more calories or eat higher-fat diets.Young people are enticed by advertising, marketing and commercialization of just about everything, explained Susan Linn in her chapter ""Too Many Screens, Too Much Stuff.""""While billions are spent around the globe to eradicate and treat pediatric diseases, as much money or more is also spent inculcating and/or exacerbating health problems for children,"" she said.The book includes valuable insights into sexualization and children's relationship with the media, and the impact of excessive media exposure on sleep and memory.A major section is dedicated to the right to participation, with Rafael Obregon and Angela Rojas Martinez providing a view on a child- and adolescent-centered approach in Latin America.  Young TV interviewee (Abu-Fadil)Arvind Singhal examined a radio show in Nepal called ""Chatting With My Best Friend"" during which young listeners can engage ""in open, honest and authentic conversations about their body, sexuality, health and interpersonal relationships.""The book is thoughtful and well researched. Parents, educators, health experts and people in the media would do well to read it."
