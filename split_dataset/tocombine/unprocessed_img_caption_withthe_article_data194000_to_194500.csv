Heejun Han Heejun rocked a 3-piece suit and shirt by Moods of Norway. He wore shoes by Zara. I topped off his dapper look with a tie, also by Moods of Norway.

Joshua Ledet Joshua performed in a statement-making customized INC International Concepts (Macy's) jacket, and shirt and pants by Zara. I finished the look with shoes from Aldo. Hollie Cavanagh Hollie dazzled in a custom dress. I kept the jewelry to a minimum, finishing her look with a ring by Rich Rocks and earrings by Charlotte Lu. Skylar Laine Skylar held to her country roots in a blouse by Lush and a studded jacket by Double D Ranchwear. Her shoes were by Jeffrey Campbell. I topped off her look with earrings by bebe, a short necklace by Charlotte Lu, and a Swarovski ring. Shannon Magrane We really wanted to make Shannon sparkle! She wore a top by ANGL and shorts by Basix (Bloomingdale's), along with Sam Adelman shoes. Her jewelry included a necklace by Charlotte Lu, bar rings by Nissa, and Rich Rocks earrings.

3,WELLNESS,Don't Lose Your Mind: 7 Ways to Prevent Mental Decline,"Dr. Veronica Anderson, Contributor

Lowering Homocysteine Levels May Slow Down Mental Decline,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9b75ec2100003000c4c177.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"As people become older, brain aging and the risk of developing a degenerative disease become serious concerns. Dementia is a primary cause of disability in the elderly and is associated with significant impairment of life quality and increased health care costs. The degeneration of the brain associated with aging is caused by several disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, strokes, fronto-temporal dementia and other less common types of neuro-degenerative diseases. Symptoms include significant memory loss, a reduction of reasoning skills and impairment of judgement, which can lead to a severely-impaired social life and require in-home or hospital care. Although the medical community widely accepted the belief that significant degeneration occurs in the brain only after the age of 65, recent research studies revealed that negative changes in the nervous tissues start as early as the 50s or even earlier. Once degenerative alterations have occurred, there are usually very few therapeutic options to effectively regain brain functionality due to their irreversibility. This is why early preventive interventions are especially important to delay the onset of symptoms, prevent mental decline and preserve brain functionality.Gary J. Kennedy, M.D., director of the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in NYC, has the expert opinion that our function of brain that affects processing time and problem solving ability slows down as our age increases. This happens due to ragged neuronal insulation when the myelin sheath surrounding the axons gets thin with the increasing age. These affects of the aging brain can be countered with continuous mental exercise. Development of new brain cells can be catalyzed through physical exercises. Additionally, moderate exercise increases the oxygen supply to the brain which protects the brain against the effects of aging.Avoiding mental decline can now be seen as a lifestyle choice and, given the research, should be started well before one's fourth decade to ensure a pathway towards becoming a centenarian with clear focus.For more by Dr. Veronica Anderson, click here.For more on Alzheimer's, click here.

However, the past few months have seen sweeping changes in tan-ittudes, all the way from The White House to the red carpet.As skin cancer rates continue to climb, health organizations and governments around the world are taking a hard look at tanning salons as a clear and present health danger to the wider population. Obama's 'Tan Tax' has hit the salon industry firmly in the back pocket. While at the recent Fall/Winter fashion collections, London's elite modeling agents banned the (sun bed) tan among their model charges. Down under in my Australian home state of New South Wales, the government has ruled that solariums and sunbeds will be illegal within the next three years. As for my own tan stance, well I admit, I've long been a fan of a deep (faux) tan -- and have the photo archives to prove it! -- but I've also dialed back my signature bronze for a more subtle hue.This past awards season showed us that Hollywood is also backing the pale, an interesting trend; a number of my favorite leading ladies -- Rooney Mara, Emma Stone and Michelle Williams to name a few -- scored rave reviews for their naturally porcelain skin tone (among other style statements of course). Embracing and enhancing a fairer skin tone rather than trying to deepen one is part of a bigger trend toward making the most of your natural beauty. From the sidewalk to the red carpet, more women are choosing to embrace their natural hair texture, skin tone and even body shape rather than continuing to fight nature to fit an impossible ideal. While I'll always encourage any woman to approach glamour and beauty as a form of self-expression, it's great to see a shift towards working with and not against your natural assets.So if you're fair-skinned remember this: pale doesn't have to mean pasty. Ensure your skin is soft, smooth, and hydrated and apply a glow-enhancing base with a light hand. Keep your look light but always luminous and coolly alluring by swapping a light champagne or silver luminizer rather than reaching for your standard bronzer. A wash of silver shadow over the eyelids is a major trend for spring 2012, and it delivers just the right amount of shimmer on women with fair, cool skin tones. Bold lips are also a top trend for spring, and a surefire strategy for adding color and vitality to the face. Choose a blue based red, pink or even fuchsia to complement fair skin and add a flattering pop of color."

8,STYLE & BEAUTY,Malaysian Shoe Store Offers 'Free Man' With Shoe Purchase,Alice Hines,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shoe-dating-malaysia-shoes-prostitution_us_5b9b79e9e4b03a1dcc77e7c9,"Can you imagine if it was the other way round?

The store has teamed up with a dating website to pair shoe-obsessed women with men who will pay for for their purchases, in exchange for a date. Here's how it works:The men sign up on the dating site Lunch Actually and pick out 20 shoes that they would like to see a potential date wear. The guys then pledge to pay for anywhere from 10 to 100 percent of the cost of the shoe. (A good indicator of their desperation?) When a woman buys a pair of shoes at the Kuala Lumpur store, she can then go online and check out her potential shoe-gar daddies' profiles. After one date, a woman can be reimbursed by her match. You might be wondering -- isn't this a form of shoe prostitution? Shoes Shoes Shoes sees the system more like something that would happen on HBO's hit show ""Sex and the City."" As the store writes on its Facebook page:Why sit and wait for Mr. Right to drop from the sky? Go do what you like most first - shop for shoes and live out your ""Sex And The City"" dreams (think Carrie!). and leave it to the professionals to find you your Mr. Big. with a possible discount of 100% to boot.Most commenters on the store's Facebook page seem enamored with ""Shoe Dating"" -- and the shirtless male models Shoes Shoes Shoes has put in its store. Still, some have wondered if the idea is sexist. Commenter Sheila Santharamohana asked:Can you imagine if it was the other way round? When a man bought shoes, he'd get a woman for a date as well? We'd all be screaming blue murder at the sexism. Why do we countenance this unethical marketing gimmick? For shame.Shoes Shoes Shoes responded: Yes, Sheila. you're right. Women would and should be screaming murder if it was the other way round. That's why shoe dating isn't the other way round. :) Anyway, thanks for the feedback, peeps! A good weekend to all!What do you think? Would you go on a date in exchange for a free pair of shoes?Check out photos of the Shoes Shoes Shoes' male model-filled windows: "
