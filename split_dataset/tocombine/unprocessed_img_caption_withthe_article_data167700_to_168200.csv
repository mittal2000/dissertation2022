For public companies, the best metric is usually share price. It is hard for chief executives to be considered very good if the shares of their company do not outperform the broader market.However, current success does not mean future success is certain, and the best CEOs must also make sure their companies continue to thrive. To succeed, a CEO might have a strategic vision, a meticulous plan or the ability to hire and keep excellent management. Good performance means more to shareholders, if a stock price continues to improve over the long term. Near the top of the list of CEOs who have accomplished this kind of multiyear success are Warren Buffett and Steve Jobs.24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 2012 track records of dozens of large company CEOs. We looked at share price, execution, revenue and EPS growth, as well as evidence of substantial long-term plans. Some of the CEOs who made the list because they excelled or stood out in some or all of these measures had one particularly good year. Dan Hesse of Sprint Nextel Corp. (NYSE: S) is an example. His ability to package his company and find a buyer were considered nearly impossible because of larger competitors AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and Verizon Wireless. Nevertheless, Hesse managed to make a deal with Softbank, which paid a large premium to take a 70% interest in the Sprint.Other CEOs have posted many years of strong earnings and sales growth. In most cases, to do so they have changed their products to draw in new customers or create better operating efficiencies. Howard Schultz of Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX) is among these CEOs. Starbucks has not only expanded its store base, but it has done so to some extent because of a series of product innovations and additions.To identify the best CEOs of 2012, 24/7 Wall St. screened for best performing stocks in the S&P 500 using Cap IQ. The market value of the company had to be greater than $3 billion. We also examined EPS and earnings growth for the most recent quarter and recent year. To ensure that we only measured the impact of the current CEO and not a predecessor, we only considered executives who had been in the position for at least two years. Finally, we only considered CEOs who had done something particularly meaningful that had, or likely would have, a long-term effect on the companies they run. "

""The federal government shouldn't tell business owners they have to contract to buy what they see as immoral services and goods.""Judges Joel Flaum and Diane Sykes comprised the 7th Circuit majority.Judge Ilana Rovner dissented. She said the Kortes were ""multiple steps"" removed from the contraceptives services because it was their company paying for the coverage, and because it would be a worker, her doctor and the insurer involved in the decisions about the services and their funding.The Kortes' case is expected to continue in the 7th Circuit.Neither the 7th Circuit nor Sotomayor ruled on the merits of their respective cases. The legal standard for obtaining an injunction from the Supreme Court is much higher.The case is Korte et al v. Sebelius, 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 12-3841.

If Congress does not make that happen, the first bill brought up in the new year would be to reduce taxes for middle-income families, Obama told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""""Now I think that over the next 48 hours, my hope is that people recognize that, regardless of partisan differences, our top priority has to be to make sure that taxes on middle-class families do not go up. That would hurt our economy badly,"" Obama said in the interview taped on Saturday.""We can get that done. Democrats and Republicans both say they don't want taxes to go up on middle-class families. That's something we all agree on. If we can get that done, that takes a big bite out of the 'fiscal cliff.' It avoids the worst outcomes,"" Obama added.Low income tax rates first put in place under Republican former President George W. Bush are due to expire at the end of the day on Monday - the last day of 2012.Obama said that failing to reach a deal would have a negative impact on financial markets.""If people start seeing that on January 1st this problem still hasn't been solved, that we haven't seen the kind of deficit reduction that we could have had had the Republicans been willing to take the deal that I gave them ... then obviously that's going to have an adverse reaction in the markets,"" he said.RARE SENATE SESSION ON SUNDAYObama met with congressional leaders at the White House on Friday and declared himself cautiously optimistic about the chances of an agreement, but he noted in the interview that nothing had materialized since then.""I was modestly optimistic yesterday, but we don't yet see an agreement. And now the pressure's on Congress to produce,"" he said.The Senate is scheduled to hold a rare Sunday session beginning at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT), but it was not clear whether the chamber would have fiscal-cliff legislation to act upon.Obama sketched out what he believed to be the most likely scenarios the end the back-and-forth between both sides. Either the congressional leaders would come up with a deal, or Democrats in the Senate would bring a bill to the floor seeking an up-or-down vote to extend tax cuts for middle income earners.""And if all else fails, if Republicans do in fact decide to block it, so that taxes on middle class families do in fact go up on January 1st, then we'll come back with a new Congress on January 4th and the first bill that will be introduced on the floor will be to cut taxes on middle class families,"" he said.Obama chided Republicans for resisting his call for tax rates to go up for the top two percent of U.S. earners despite what he viewed as significant compromises on his part to cut spending and reform expensive social programs for the poor and elderly.""They say that their biggest priority is making sure that we deal with the deficit in a serious way, but the way they're behaving is that their only priority is making sure that tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans are protected. That seems to be their only overriding, unifying theme,"" Obama said.""The offers that I've made to them have been so fair that a lot of Democrats get mad at me. I mean I offered to make some significant changes to our entitlement programs in order to reduce the deficit,"" he said."

(AP Photo) CHINA OUT",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb35ea0250000940038b77e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Steve Stecklow(Reuters) - A major Iranian partner of Huawei Technologies offered to sell at least 1.3 million euros worth of embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator in late 2010, documents show.China's Huawei, the world's second largest telecommunications equipment maker, says neither it nor its partner, a private company registered in Hong Kong, ultimately provided the HP products to the telecom, Mobile Telecommunication Co of Iran, known as MCI. Nevertheless, the incident provides new evidence of how Chinese companies have been willing to help Iran evade trade sanctions.The proposed deal also raises new questions about Shenzhen-based Huawei, which recently was criticized by the U.S. House Intelligence Committee for failing to ""provide evidence to support its claims that it complies with all international sanctions or U.S. export laws.""At least 13 pages of the proposal to MCI, which involved expanding its subscriber billing system, were marked ""Huawei confidential"" and carried the company's logo, according to documents seen by Reuters. In a statement to Reuters, Huawei called it a ""bidding document"" and said one of its ""major local partners,"" Skycom Tech Co Ltd, had submitted it to MCI.The statement went on to say, ""Huawei's business in Iran is in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those of the U.N., U.S. and E.U. This commitment has been carried out and followed strictly by our company. Further, we also require our partners to follow the same commitment and strictly abide by the relevant laws and regulations.""In October, Reuters reported that another Iranian partner of Huawei last year tried to sell embargoed American antenna equipment to Iran's second largest mobile operator, MTN Irancell, in a deal the buyer ultimately rejected. The U.S. antenna manufacturer, CommScope Inc, has an agreement with Huawei in which the Chinese firm can use its products in Huawei systems, according to a CommScope spokesman. He added that his company strives to comply fully with all U.S. laws and sanctions.Huawei has a similar partnership with HP. In a statement, the Palo Alto, Calif., company said, ""HP has an extensive control system in place to ensure our partners and resellers comply with all legal and regulatory requirements involving system security, global trade and customer privacy and the company's relationship with Huawei is no different.""The statement added, ""HP's distribution contract terms prohibit the sale of HP products into Iran and require compliance with U.S. and other applicable export laws.""Washington has banned the export of computer equipment to Iran for years. The sanctions are designed to deter Iran from developing nuclear weapons; Iran says its nuclear program is aimed purely at producing domestic energy.CLOSE LINKSHuawei and its Iranian partner, Skycom, appear to have very close ties.An Iranian job recruitment site called Irantalent.com describes Skycom as ""a leading telecom solution provider"" and goes on to list details that are identical to the way Huawei describes itself on its U.S. website: employee-owned, selling ""solutions"" used by ""45 of the world's top 50 telecom operators"" and serving ""one-third of the world's population.""On LinkedIn.com, several telecom workers list having worked at ""Huawei-skycom"" on their resumes. A former Skycom employee said the two companies shared the same headquarters in China. And an Iranian telecom manager who has visited Skycom's office in Tehran said, ""Everybody carries Huawei badges.""A Hong Kong accountant whose firm is listed in Skycom registration records as its corporate secretary said Friday he would check with the company to see if anyone would answer questions. Reuters did not hear back.The proposal to MCI, dated October 2010, would have doubled the capacity of MCI's billing system for prepaid customers. The proposal noted that MCI was ""growing fast"" and that its current system, provided by Huawei, had ""exceeded the system capacity"" to handle 20 million prepaid subscribers.""In order to keep serving (MCI) with high quality, we provide this expansion proposal to support 40M subscribers,"" the proposal states on a page marked ""HUAWEI Confidential.""The proposal makes clear that HP computer servers were an integral part of the ""Hardware Installation Design"" of the expansion project. Tables listing equipment for MCI facilities at a new site in Tehran and in the city of Shiraz repeatedly reference HP servers under the heading, ""Minicomputer Model.""The documents seen by Reuters also include a portion of an equipment price list that carries Huawei's logo and are stamped ""SKYCOM IRAN OFFICE."" The pages list prices for HP servers, disk arrays and switches, including those that already are ""existing"" and others that need to be added. The total proposed project price came to 19.9 million euros, including a ""one time special discount.""The proposed new HP equipment, which totaled 1.3 million euros, included one server, 20 disk arrays, 22 switches and software. The existing HP equipment included 22 servers, 8 disk arrays and 13 switches, with accompanying prices.Asked who had provided the existing HP equipment to MCI, Vic Guyang, a Huawei spokesman, said it wasn't Huawei. ""We would like to add that the existing hardware equipment belongs to the customer. Huawei does not have information on, or the authority to check the source of the customer's equipment.""Officials with MCI did not respond to requests for comment.In a series of stories this year, Reuters has documented how China has become a backdoor for Iran to obtain embargoed U.S. computer equipment. In March and April, Reuters reported that China's ZTE Corp, a Huawei competitor, had sold or agreed to sell millions of dollars worth of U.S. computer gear, including HP equipment, to Telecommunication Co of Iran, the country's largest telecommunications firm, and a unit of the consortium that controls TCI.The articles sparked investigations by the U.S. Commerce Department, the Justice Department and some of the U.S. tech companies. ZTE says it is cooperating with the federal probes.TCI is the parent company of MCI.(Additional reporting by Grace Li and Chyen Yee Lee in Hong Kong and Marcus George in Dubai; Edited by Simon Robinson)"

(AP Photo/ Captain David Anderson's Dolphin and Whale Safari)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb12c5a250000940038124c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The ocean is enormous, supporting a vast array of life while providing food, fuel, recreation, and spiritual rejuvenation. But efforts to conserve the ocean, though valiant, are meager compared to the scale of the threats to the ocean. Ocean conservation advocates have achieved many notable successes, such as dramatic reductions in certain kinds of pollution, the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and major improvements in fishery management in some areas of the world. However, a recent analysis that the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) participated in suggests that 40 percent of the ocean is still strongly impacted by a range of threats, including shipping, the modification of rivers and estuaries, coastal development, pollution, and overfishing. How can we scale conservation efforts up to match the ocean's vastness and the severity of these threats?To answer this question, we must first accurately diagnose the problem. Conventional markets, which drive so much of mass human behavior, only value a few of the many goods and services that the ocean provides, like fish and oil. The critically important ocean processes that produce fish, regulate the climate, assimilate wastes, and provide all of the other goods and services on which the diversity of ocean life and we humans depend are generally not valued by markets. Because markets see value only in parts of the ocean, and not in the whole, the valuable pieces are extracted and the rest is degraded.Conservation has been pushing back against market forces, among the most powerful forces in the world, in the form of regulation. While regulations like water quality standards and MPAs can be very effective, they often depend on high levels of enforcement because they are working against market forces and the incentives to exploit valuable resources without stewarding the ecosystems that support them. Regulations in this context are often perceived as threats to livelihood and human welfare, resulting in opposition and conflict. It is not surprising that it typically takes many years and sometimes decades to get ocean conservation measures in place.Conservation has been like playing soccer uphill. No matter how skillfully and energetically we kick the ball; it keeps rolling back, forcing us to scramble continuously to keep it up field. And in much of the world, the field is very steep -- the pressure to overexploit ocean resources is particularly strong because few alternative sources of livelihood, food, fiber, and other resources are available. To scale up ocean conservation, we need to level the playing field so the ball rolls into the conservation goal. This means ensuring markets work for conservation, instead of against it. In our new paper, just published in Biological Reviews, my coauthors and I evaluate the increasing number of tools that are available for doing just that. Catch shares have helped fisheries meet their conservation goals while increasing profits. Payments for ecosystem services are resulting in improved coastal watershed conservation. Mitigation banking has helped restore mangrove forests, salt marshes, and oyster reefs. Water quality markets (cap and trade programs) have helped farmers reduce polluted runoff. And new markets that value other ecosystem services, such as the amazingly efficient carbon storage capacity of mangrove forests and even the recreational value of coral reefs, are rapidly emerging. We term this collection of tools ""eco-markets.""Market-based ocean conservation is no panacea. Governments must still create and enforce the rules and constraints that any market needs to avoid bad outcomes. Moreover, many serious challenges remain. These market-based conservation tools must be very carefully designed and implemented to be effective. New kinds of secure privileges must be created that allow coastal stewards to benefit from their own conservation efforts must be created, and these privileges need to extend over whole areas, not just pieces of the ecosystem. New social contracts must be forged to hold the beneficiaries of these privileges accountable to their stewardship responsibilities. Strenuous efforts to overcome these challenges are justified though, because the new economies that result will value the ocean, empower its stewards, and create the potential for ocean conservation to become as large as the ocean itself."
