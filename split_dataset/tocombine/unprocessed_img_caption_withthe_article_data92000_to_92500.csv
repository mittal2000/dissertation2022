The battle between ride-sharing and traditional taxi service is heating up in New York, with a new rival for ride-seekers declared illegal even before launching. Lyft, a ride-sharing service that operates in 60 US cities and competes with the likes of Uber, announced plans to launch Friday in the city boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, claiming these communities are 'vastly underserved' by existing transport options. Lyft said it had recruited 500 drivers in the Big Apple and that 75,000 New Yorkers had downloaded its mobile application ahead of the launch. The municipal agency said in a statement that Lyft 'is unauthorized in New York City' and has failed to comply with safety and licensing requirements. AFP PHOTO / Timothy A.

It's the life in your years. My travels around the world have taught me many things that I couldn't learn commuting in a first-world country. Growing up in Canada, I always knew that I wanted to explore the world. I researched doing a student exchange in high school, and was always fascinated by National Geographic. It wasn't until university that I got the chance (and the motivation) to pursue this dream. After my freshman summer was spent working at a typical office internship I knew, I never want to do that again! So I tiptoed out of my comfort zone and got a gig teaching English in Italy. This spiraled into many more paid travel internships so that I had visited 21 countries in Asia, Africa and Europe by the time I graduated university. Now, when young people hear my story, they often ask me, ""Should I travel too?""I always, always answer, ""If you have a desire to travel, do it. It's your soul longing to grow. It means there is something out there for you to learn.""Pack your bags. Book your ticket. I'm going to share with you my top six lessons gleaned from climbing volcanoes in Bali, trekking across deserts in Africa and swimming in the Indian Ocean. 6. There is a greater power guiding your every step.Everything happens for your good, so you can learn what you need to grow. When I first started travelling, I would blaze through countries, giddy with awe and wonder at our magnificent world. In time though, the excitement wore off and my plans would go wrong. I would get lost. I would lose money. I would get sick. This was where I started to realize that I wasn't alone. There was a reason that a help would always show up from out of seemingly nowhere.""You are loved and taken care of."" ""Forgive and let go."" ""Be kind."" ""You are never alone.""Like whispers in my ear, these messages started appearing when I started looking at my travel hiccups differently. 5. Be kind to yourself and compassionate to everyone.This includes the person who stole my wallet in Tanzania and the guy who sold me a fake bus ticket. Everyone is doing the best they can at the time. For every terrible thing that happened to me, I also have countless memories of people's incredible kindness. Total strangers have invited me to ""opa!"" at their weddings and to share dinner at their homes! There is so much love in the universe. Choose to be a part of it. Let go. Forgive. 4. Bloom where you are planted. I've travelled to run away. I've travelled to escape. I've travelled for love. I've travelled away from love. I've travelled to grow. I've travelled to explore. I've travelled to hide. I've travelled to laugh. I've travelling to cry. In the end, I grow the most when I am fully present wherever I am, not trying to get someone else. 3. The greatest moments in life always, always come after a struggle. It really is about the journey. I trekked up a volcanoe in Bali last year, and I remember oscillating between anger, ecstasy, self-loathing, fun, disgust, excitement for the two-hour hike up. At 6 a.m., we reached the summit, and I witnessed one of the most spectacular sunrises of my life. Struggle is okay. It's okay to be down and depressed sometime. Just don't stay there. Get back up. Choose a different thought. There is always sunset that will take your breath away. 2. Lighten up. It's all going to be okay.I used to swim off the coast of Zanzibar, Tanzania stressing about whether or not I should be in Canada building my ""career"" instead. Am I just wasting time? Shouldn't I be at a ""normal"" job? I finally realized that I should simply enjoy this moment! That summer in Zanzibar ended up leading to an amazing internship in Rwanda the following year, but there was no way I could foresee that. I've had too many instances of miracles on the road to believe that life is just a big chaotic mess. Time and time again, paid jobs show up at the last minute. Finances come through to fund trips.

In the process, you will grow and carve a totally unique path for yourself. You don't need to be everything to everyone. Just strive to be the greatest version of you.Even though you have my secrets now, chances are, you need to experience them to know them in your heart and soul.If you have an inner nudge to travel, it's because there is a part of you that desires to grow!

Seriously, if anyone can bring true realism to a ‘reality tv show’ (not that we’ve ever watched Real Housewives, The Bachelor, or reality shows in general of course…) it’s Bethenny Frankel.She’s also keeping it real with her new book out today -- I Suck At Relationships So You Don’t Have To -- whose title speaks for itself. Like the episode The Opposite on Seinfeld, Bethenny – like George Costanza – aims to have you do the exact opposite of everything she’s ever done in dating. Frankel filled us in on ways to kickstart healthy eating, our relationship with food and why women are most definitely crazy…From start to finish, what would be your ideal food day?For breakfast, definitely an egg white omelette with spinach, tomato, onion, and feta cheese. On the side, a scooped out toasted whole wheat bagel with butter and a few slices of turkey bacon. And of course, iced coffee with soy milk and a splash of Skinnygirl Stevia Liquid Sweetener. Lunch is usually a “use what you have salad” but my favorite is arugula salad with bresaola, shaved parmesan, olive oil, and a lemon squeeze. Sometimes, I sneak in a split pea soup, as well! Then it’s definitely time for some kind of sweetness. Recently, I’ve been craving and loving my new Dark Chocolate with Almond Skinnygirl Nutrition Bar. They are perfection! Dinner is always changing, but, ideally, I’d go for roasted Brussels sprouts, sliced charred steak, baked potato with salt and butter, a crab cake, and a kale Caesar salad. And of course, my favorite cocktails! My recent favorites have been Skinnygirl Pinot Grigio or Skinnygirl Bare Naked Vodka with olives.Read more on The New Potato"
7,WORLDPOST,What's Really Behind The War In Yemen?,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yemen-war-sectarian-violence_n_7019210.html,,2015-04-11,"FILE - In this Wednesday, April 1, 2015 file photo, Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, carry their weapons as they march to protest against Saudi-led airstrikes, during a rally in Sanaa, Yemen. Saudi-led coalition warplanes bombed Shiite rebel positions in both north and south Yemen early Wednesday, setting off explosions and drawing return fire from anti-aircraft guns. (AP Photo/Hani Mohammed, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14921240000350076f3ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. To gain insight on the conflict in Yemen, we turned to analyst Dr. April Longley Alley.Yemen is currently in a state of crisis as fighting between Houthi rebels and forces loyal to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi devastates the country. In addition to the gun battles and shelling in major cities, there have been weeks of airstrikes by a Saudi-led coalition against the Houthis, which have leveled buildings and infrastructure.The continued ground fighting and Saudi air campaign has also threatened to worsen the already dire humanitarian situation in Yemen, while the death toll from the conflict has risen to over 540.The current crisis stems from disagreements between groups in Yemen's complex political environment that started even before the ouster of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh in a 2011 uprising. To better understand the conflict gripping Yemen, The WorldPost spoke with Dr. April Longley Alley, senior analyst on the Arabian Peninsula for the International Crisis Group.The Houthi insurgency has been going on for years, but in recent months has drastically escalated. What was the catalyst for that escalation?There are a number of reasons for the escalation. Yemen's transition process started in 2011 and there was a road map to guide the country to reform. While some achievements were made, the process stalled and various political groups failed to come to consensus on two core issues that became real sticking points. The first was the details of pre-election power-sharing agreements, and how exactly to integrate groups like the Houthis into decision-making structures. Then there was also the issue of the the state, particularly the boundaries of federal regions.When dialogue ended in early 2014, these two unresolved issues continued to fester, corruption continued and the old power structures were left in place. Throughout the three year transition, the Houthis began to take advantage of state weakness and expanded militarily in the absence of political reform.The government's removal of the fuel subsidy last summer was a tipping point. The Houthis and their supporters mobilized in and around the capital of Sanaa and eventually began to take over.This has been described as a sectarian conflict between the Shiite Houthi rebels and Sunni tribes. How accurate is that framing?At its core this is not a sectarian conflict, this is a political power struggle between various Yemeni actors.Yemen has a Zaidi community, which practices a version of Shiite Islam. They are the majority in the far north but the minority in the country. Then there is a majority Shafi’i population, who follow a version of Sunni Islam. These communities have intermarried and they pray in each other’s mosques. While some regional divides and divisions in the political economy sometimes overlap with the Zaidi-Shafi’i divides, there's no history of sectarian conflict in Yemen. To frame it in terms of sectarian conflict is therefore misleading.At its core this is not a sectarian conflict, this is a political power struggle between various Yemeni actors.At the same time, however, we’re seeing a dangerous development inside of Yemen where increasingly sectarian language is being used to describe the conflict both by regional actors and by Yemenis.The war is also sometimes described as a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia. How legitimate is that description?The Houthis do have connections with Iran, and there is some degree of assistance, although the degree is not clear in terms of financial and military assistance.The more important point is that in particular Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states are increasingly viewing Yemen and the Houthis through the lens of a war between Saudis and Iran. When they look at the Houthis they see an Iranian threat, and that is shaping the conflict dynamics inside of Yemen.When they look at the Houthis they see an Iranian threat.The Houthis, to be fair, have given their neighbors good reason for concern by their rhetoric and by their actions. For instance, the Houthis have taken a symbolic step of opening flights with Tehran and they also sent a high-level delegation to Iran to ask for assistance and economic development. In some ways it seems to be becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.How does former President Ali Abdullah Saleh factor into the crisis?Ali Abdullah Saleh is still a critical player in Yemen’s local power struggle. For example, he tacitly aligned with the Houthis as they advanced in the north in 2014. This alliance was not because of ideological affiliation or because this has an enduring shelf life politically, but at that point they were struggling against common enemies.Saleh doesn’t have an army, but this is someone who after 33 years of power has tremendous influence and deep networks within the army, the air force, security services and the tribal confederations in the north. As the Houthis have expanded south, their support base has become more diluted and they’ve relied more on the supporters of Saleh.What is the endgame for Saleh?Saleh is probably driven by a number of factors and we know that he never had intentions of giving up politics. Certainly it’s fair to say he would like his son to have a prominent role in politics moving forward, possibly as president through elections.What kind of humanitarian crisis can we expect the fighting will leave behind beyond what we’ve already seen?Yemen is a country that even before this current conflict was moving towards a humanitarian crisis. It’s a country that is 90 percent dependent on imports for its food and it’s already running out of water in critical cities.Yemen is a country that even before this current conflict was moving towards a humanitarian crisis.It’s already facing a hunger and malnutrition crisis throughout the country, and this fighting is obviously only accelerating the crisis in an acute and alarming way. The airstrikes have targeted critical infrastructure for the movement of goods and have also targeted electrical plants.What possible outcomes do you see for the conflict?A crucial question is what the political endgame is from the Saudi side. At this point, there isn’t a clear and viable exit strategy and it could drag on for quite a long time. This could be the beginning of a long and bloody conflict in Yemen that continues to draw in regional actors and exacerbate human suffering.There is no military solution to the problem inside of Yemen. There's no single group that stands out as a clear winner. The country is deeply divided politically, so no group can solidify their writ over the entire country at this point.The Saudi intervention, unless there is real thought to a clear political end-state, is likely to lead to prolonged violence and instability.This interview took place on Apr. 7, 2015.

At the same time, he emphasized that the timeline for withdrawal (most U.S. troops are to be out of Afghanistan by the end of next year) had not changed. The delay in the drawing down of U.S. forces comes at a time when the president has been pressured to either get out of Afghanistan entirely or expand and extend our military presence there. The delay also has been accompanied by a similar debate in Iraq, where more than 3,000 U.S. troops remain. Withdrawing from these two countries has brought to our attention just how hard it is for the U.S. to extricate itself from its military interventions. Indeed, most people -- even the smartest, most level-headed government officials and military experts -- find that doing so is agonizingly difficult and much more challenging than the original intervention. My own experience with the question of withdrawal dates back to Vietnam. I entered Congress in the mid-1960s as a supporter of the war, but gradually changed my opinion. As my view of the war changed, I struggled, like many others did, with the question of pulling out our military presence. I now find it remarkable how many strong similarities exist between our nation's challenge in getting out of Vietnam and what we confront today in Afghanistan and Iraq. The president's decision regarding troop withdrawal from Afghanistan represents just the latest chapter in the debate over the issue of how to withdraw. On one side of the debate are those who think we should pull out all military presence now to avoid any further losses in Afghanistan, where U.S. troops have been stationed since 2001 in our longest war. On the other side are those who want the U.S. to be even more deeply involved and not leave until Afghanistan is secure and stable. However, recent history has indicated our policymakers and perhaps the majority of Americans reject both of these options. For obvious reasons, we're unwilling to commit to an all-out war and decades of building a new nation. Yet we're also unwilling to cut and run in the hope that we can figure out a way to do so responsibly, honorably and with a sense of accomplishment. Americans have, in recent years, been highly reluctant to add 'boots on the ground' in Afghanistan and Iraq, even when the situations there have worsened. This is understandable, of course, and so we search for ways short of supplying more combat troops. We've aggressively pursued responsible allies within and beyond the country to step in and assist us, focusing our efforts on ""moderates"" living in these and neighboring countries. Finding reliable partners has been, by itself, a formidable challenge. We've also been prepared to continue to offer military training, equipment and logistical and intelligence aid to the host country, all of which are important tools in any conflict. However, we've had an expensive and none-too-successful time trying to train and support other militaries, from the South Vietnamese fighters several decades ago to the current Afghan armed forces. As we consider our limited options, we've continually gone through an agonizing debate to persuade ourselves that we've done the best we can in the countries we've occupied or invaded and that we've at least given them an opportunity to succeed. At the same time we've also maintained that there's no military solution, only a political one, in these countries and that war cannot be won on the battlefield. We used this language in Vietnam. And we use it today in our conversations about what to do in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""There are no good options,"" we say. I've heard this 100 times. ""The situations in these places --Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan -- are way too complex for us to resolve."" Not long ago, I spoke to a top U.S. military commander who's served multiple tours of duty in Iraq, and he said to me, ""Lee, we never understood this place."" I found that to be a revealing comment. Part of the problem we traditionally face is our failure to thoroughly examine the facts on the ground and our tendency to want to neatly divide the countries in which we've been engaged into good guys and bad guys when, in fact, we're dealing with multiple actors with varying allegiances, ideologies, agendas and long histories of involvement. For years, we wrestled with the questions of whether the U.S. could bring about regime change and establish democracies in countries whose cultures and political histories suggested otherwise and what our long-term interests in those places should be. We now have a better understanding of the difficulties in building a nation. We are better at this than we once were, but my general sense is that Americans as a whole have decided that it's a bridge too far. We simply do not have the time, resources and talents to build democratic, prosperous, free nations everywhere. My hope is that we will begin to go beyond the usual questions and tackle those that keep arising as we look to leave, such as:• Who's going to lead these countries and what groups will remain 10 years from now? 20 years from now? • What steps can we take to facilitate better -- and less corrupt -- governance in Afghanistan and Iraq, two countries that were never particularly well developed and with governments that haven't been able to meet the needs of the people? • Can these countries be saved and at what cost? Will they help themselves? • How can we use regional and international diplomacy -- whatever that truly means -- to step in and help us? Is the international community willing to put in the time, talent and resources to strengthen these nations and ensure their freedom? And how do you identify and build a capable, reliable ally?• How many resources are we willing to invest to bring about security and stability in these two countries where violence and instability have unfortunately been the norm, and for how long? • And as we withdraw forces from these two key countries, how do we retain some amount of influence in their respective regions? These are obviously ‪‪excruciatingly‎‬‬ difficult questions to ‬‬‬‬‬‬answer, and it's a temptation to focus on just one or two of aspects of their many layers. To succeed in our withdrawals we must address the totality of the complex issues that impact our ability to successfully remove forces in a highly responsible way. We have no choice but to do so. The bottom line is this: Before we go in, we had better understand how to get out and the challenges that getting out entail.Lee H.

Devised at the turn of the century, the policy encouraged Chinese enterprises, backed by the country's foreign-exchange reserves, to acquire assets and expand business overseas. This initiative facilitated Chinese companies' expansion around the globe, but their acquisitions have often been marred by vast inefficiencies and corruption. Now, President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang are revamping this strategy, shifting from reckless expansion toward a more focused approach around exporting Chinese equipment and higher value goods and services.Over the past decade, Chinese companies 'Going Out' have fixated around acquisitions of natural resource assets by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) such as CNPC, Sinopec, CNOOC and Chinalco, while the majority of Chinese exports remained underwhelming in quality and significance. During last year's ""Two Sessions"" press conference, Premier Li expressed a need for change: ""We cannot just export toys, apparel or shoes . . . We also need to export Chinese equipment to . . . raise its competitiveness as they are tested on the international market."" Industrial upgrade has been one of the Xi administration's top priorities, and the new China 'Going Out' plays a major role in this transition toward higher value manufacturing and technology. Exporting high value added products like high-speed railways promotes China's image abroad and showcases its newfound competitiveness. In addition, contracting massive infrastructure projects to export materials such as steel and cement would help relieve the mounting challenge of overcapacity in these industries. The specific sectors of this new 'Going Out' model were identified in Premier Li's Government Work Report this month, where he proposed to: ""increase the international market share of Chinese railway, electric power, communications, engineering machinery, automobile, aircraft, electronics, and other equipment, and encourage the metallurgical, building materials, and other industries to invest overseas."" President Xi Jinping (right) and Premier Li Keqiang, the two Chinese leaders spearheading the country's foreign investment policies. To achieve these goals, China will need its SOEs to become more strategic, competitive, and efficient. The capstone of Xi and Li's new 'Going Out' policy is the 'One Belt One Road' strategy, an ambitious plan to revitalize the ancient Silk Road trading routes to Europe. Chinese SOEs play the crucial role of constructing infrastructure along the two planned routes, one by land through Central Asia and the Middle East, and another by sea through Southeast Asia, South Asia, and East Africa. An extensive financial support structure has been drafted, consisting of the 50bn USD Silk Road Fund Corp and the multilateral Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank with an proposed initial capital of 100bn USD. If they were to be successful, however, these institutions must not only champion SOEs, but also enable the private sector to 'Go Out' through dynamic public-private partnerships. To create globally competitive national champions, The Xi administration has also been consolidating centrally owned SOEs: The two high-speed rail manufacturers, China North Car and China South Car, announced a massive 26bn USD merger last December, while two months later, nuclear power SOEs China Power Investment Corp and State Nuclear Power Technology Corp announced another large merger. Expect this trend to continue in industries primed for going out.  CCTV's Map of the One Belt One Road plan Finally, China's leaders have aimed to root out inefficiencies about outbound investments. SOE regulators amended the evaluation mechanism for central SOE managers in 2013 to emphasize return on assets and value generation over expansion in size or revenue. Meanwhile, the ongoing anti-corruption campaign hit major 'Going Out' players in oil, mining, and rail, forcing mid-level managers to abandon prevalent corrupt practices in overseas projects. Beijing recently announced a plan to externally audit of all overseas assets belonging to central SOEs.Despite these audacious reforms, Chinese SOEs still face significant challenges abroad. First, while reformers have tried to increase SOE efficiency by emphasizing economic goals, Xi Jinping gave his 'Going Out' champions the political objective of westward expansion along the 'One Belt One Road.' SOE managers may have to juggle between this contradiction, striving for efficiency on one hand and pressured to take on less profitable but strategically important contracts on the other. Also, Chinese SOEs face rising political risk as they venture into more unstable regions along the 'One Belt One Road.' The debacles of China Railway Construction Corp and China Communications Construction Corp, respectively in Mexico and Sri Lanka, show that SOEs are ill prepared to manage those risks.'Going Out' 2.0 will create stronger and more competitive Chinese SOEs, expanding into sectors traditionally dominated by Western firms, and exerting influence in regions that will raise new geopolitical challenges. Investments and products from the Chinese economy will only become more consequential globally, making it crucial to grasp and engage with this change._________Ben Yunmo Wang is a researcher at Eurasia Group's Asia Practice and a recent graduate of Tufts University.

But there is very little in his rhetoric that indicates India's leadership on addressing this challenge. The speech was spluttered with self contradicting statements that deftly obfuscate from the stark reality of climate change and why India's inaction can prove very costly to its people. Here are some of those contradictionsTraditional vs. Modern  Modi enjoys invoking the Hindu traditions and rituals that inherently view the natural environment with respect and bear little harm on it. He consistently hails ancient wisdom and the solutions they offer to challenges like climate change. ""Environmental protection, worship and conservation are rooted in our culture. We don't have the right to exploit natural resources,"" Modi stated. Frugality, resourcefulness, worshipping trees et al are some of those ideas he tries to reframe and re-apply to the modern world with very little practical sense. The Hindu mores and traditions offer values and principles to base our lives on but don't drive policies for the 21st century challenges that have emerged from a very different reality. Modi's election to power last year has spurred off an aggressive fervour to celebrate Hindu festivals but unfortunately without the environmental sensibilities. The conference, where Modi wielded his environmental rhetoric, is expected to result in the dilution of major environmental policies to give a free run for industry. Doing away with environmental clearances, revoking the rights of tribals to forest land, approving coal mining in dense forests; the list of policy changes the Government introduced has capital, not the environment or our traditional values, at the heart of it. The irony persists in the recent statements made by the environment minister. Prakash Javdekar stated that India would reduce its carbon emissions if money and technology were given by the rich world. If our rich cultural history offers the wisdom and the practices needed to live sustainably, the dependence on foreign money and technology remains questionable. Individual vs. Government action""Can our urban agencies agree to turn off all the street lights once a month and instead depend on the light of the full moon?"", asked Modi during his speech. ""Our tradition celebrated the full moon, an act that can bring the community together and also reduce electricity consumption in the process."" The Prime Minister urges people to look inwards and question their own lifestyles to address climate change. He hits the nail on the head here. Consumption is indeed, at the root, the driver of carbon emissions. All economies with historically high consumption of resources have worsened the climate problem. But to suggest that India is doing anything differently is an obvious myth. By coming to power on an agenda of development that is driven by the pursuit of ever higher GDP growth, Modi needs greater consumption of natural resources; applying the mainstream thinking of the 20th century that drove us to this problem in the first place. We are unfortunately beyond the stage where small or individual action to change ones light bulb, turning off the streetlights, cycling to work on a Monday, carpooling or other lifestyle choices could address this challenge. Research based on the latest climate science suggests that to avoid catastrophic climate change, 82 percent of known coal reserves in the world should be left in the ground. For India and China, the study reveals that 66 percent of their known coal reserves should remain unburned. This demands a dramatic shift in Government policy that favor sustainable development and reduced dependence on coal and other fossil fuels. Modi's Government is doing the exact opposite. India vs. the rest of the world  The world cannot dictate what India can or can't do on climate change, says Modi. With per capita carbon emissions of roughly three tonnes per annum, India pales in comparison to North America that emits more than 20 tonnes per capita. This is an obvious fact that supports Modi's statement and substantiates India's historical position on climate change at international negotiations. What it belies is the gross inequity within India that results in a miniscule average in carbon emissions. As the third largest carbon emitter of the world, India's absolute emissions from domestic sources are rising but only a small section of the population is contributing to it. A recent study showed that CO2 emissions from urban households are 16 times higher than rural households. If that status quo remains, the real benefactors will be the SUV driving, condo living, air conditioned addicts that match the emission levels of the west but continue to hide behind the poor. It is important to differentiate India's responsibility to the world vis-a-vis its own people. Climate change and extreme weather disasters that we are witnessing today are not India's doing but a result of emissions over the last century, largely produced by western economies. But India's growing contribution to the problem by increasing fossil fuel dependence will only jeopardize the lives and livelihoods of millions of its citizens, virtually assuring a game-over scenario for the climate. Over the last 2 months, unseasonal rainfall and hailstorms have damaged more than 11 million hectares of cropland in India. Wheat output is estimated to drop 5%, distressed farmers are committing suicide and food prices are expected to go skywards for the coming few months. The brunt of these impacts are immediately felt by the poorest and the most vulnerable in India's diverse society as climate change continues to threaten their lives. These impacts are just a snapshot of what we can expect, only with greater severity and frequency, if global emissions, including India's, are not drastically cut. India's action on climate change should therefore be driven by an effort to safeguard its own people as opposed to a posturing that so far has only yielded in blame shifting.Environment vs. DevelopmentModi and his Government's spokespersons have been pursuing a method of debate that immediately boxes people into ideologies and scuttles the main discussion. Those who question certain projects in the name of environment are seen as being ideologically opposed to the Government and therefore unable to appreciate its efforts for development. The labels of anti development or anti national on a few individuals and institutions is a manifestation of this approach. ""To suggest that environment and development are at odds is absolutely wrong. Both can move together and co-exist"", Modi remarked. He goes on to state the example of the coal cess that has been increased to Rs 200 per tonne of coal, a move that is aimed at offsetting the impacts of coal by enhancing clean energy usage. It is a positive move to raise money except for the fact that environmental protection, in no way, is guaranteed in this process. Coal production is set to increase and with weakening of laws to mine and set up power generation units, Modi is doubling down on natural resource exploitation. Take the example of air pollution in Delhi. When CNG or natural gas was made mandatory for public transport, there was a visible change in air quality and the move was hailed by many as game changing. Less than two decades on, Delhi has turned into the world's most polluted city. Rapacious consumption driven by more private vehicles, dramatic rise in construction and greater number of polluting industries has increased the per capita wealth of Delhi but left very little clean air to breathe. Irrespective of the political party in power, the development models that India has espoused pose an inherent risk to the environment. The current Government's alacrity to continue and expand this risk stands in conflict with Modi's hollow assurances of environmental protection. Us vs. UsYes, the world doesn't need to tell India what to do because of our unique cultural value to the environment and our minimal contribution to historic carbon emissions, but neither can India's Prime minister continue to dwell in rhetoric and falsely lead the public into thinking he is doing enough to protect them.

The momentous settlement will have no cap to compensate the plaintiffs, though BP PLC estimated it would have to pay out about $7.8 billion, making it one of the largest class-action settlements ever.

It is timed to coincide with the five-year anniversary of the BP disaster, which killed 11 men and sent millions of barrels of oil spewing into the gulf.The rule is expected to tighten safety requirements on blowout preventers, devices that are the last line of protection to stop explosions in undersea oil and gas wells, the Times reported.The White House did not immediatley respond to a request for comment.The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in 2010 was caused in part when the buckling of a section of drill pipe led to the malfunction of a supposedly fail-safe blowout preventer on a BP well, the paper said.The regulation comes as the Obama administration is taking steps to open up vast new areas of federal waters off the southeast Atlantic Coast to drilling, a decision that has infuriated environmentalists, the Times reported.It will be the third and biggest new drilling-equipment regulation put forth by the Obama administration in response to the disaster, the Times said. In 2010, the Interior Department announced new regulations on drilling well casings, and in 2012, it announced new regulations on the cementing of wells.

As I look around I will also see hundreds of runners wearing a ""St. Jude Hero"" singlet just like mine, I'll know something that they won't know -- that the beautiful young lady standing next to me (and also wearing a St. Jude Hero singlet) might not be there if it weren't for their support.That beautiful young lady by my side will be my 10-year-old daughter Audrey. A little over three years ago she was diagnosed with an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) in her lung. In the early morning hours of her diagnosis, I asked the nurse how big the tumor was, needing some perspective on what she was dealing with. The nurse responded that it was approximately 10 cm. Having forgotten my metric chart during those difficult hours, I pressed her for a more relative comparison. She said that it was as big as a baseball. At the time, Audrey was only six years old and weighed only 38 pounds. The thought of a tumor that large in her tiny little body sent a wave of panic and concern over our family, not knowing what the future might bring. Fortunately, for children like Audrey, there is an incredible beacon of hope in the fight against pediatric cancer -- St. Jude Children Research Hospital. Audrey was referred to St Jude, where we quickly learned the depths to which this incredible hospital would go to ensure that she received the care she needed. In the three-and-a-half years since she has been a patient at St. Jude, she has received world-class care at no cost to our family. Her tumor has been eradicated through a series of surgeries and treatments that has left her completely healthy and able to lead the normal life of a 10-year-old girl. In fact, her health is so good, that on April 25 she'll be with me, competing in her third 5K as part of the St. Jude Country Music Marathon and Half-marathon. The St. Jude Hero program allows runners from all over the country to raise funds as they compete in races like the ones in Nashville. For my family, it has proven to be an exciting and fun way to give back to the incredible hospital that has done so much for us. For the last four years dozens of friends and family members have joined us to compete as Team ""AC and the Tough Kids"" in honor of my daughter (AC) and her fellow St. Jude patients, the ones she affectionately refers to as ""the tough kids.""As I write this we have raised nearly $225,000 for St. Jude over that time and are hoping to reach $250,000 by April 25. Our community in Sevier County, Tennessee, has rallied around us like I never could have imagined and has shared in our gratitude for all that St. Jude has done for us. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital subsists largely because of donations through programs like the St. Jude Hero program. It depends on donors to be able to provide the care children like Audrey so desperately need. As Audrey and I stand near the start line, I'll be thinking about those donors. I'll be thinking about my fellow St. Jude Heroes who have raised so much money and trained so hard. I'll be thinking about Audrey and how lucky we are to be there. Finally, I'll be thinking about the real St. Jude heroes -- the ""tough kids"" and the incredible hospital that cares for them."

I am on my daily commute to school. In one hour, I travel from a tree-shaded suburban town to this rhythmic center of noise and motion. Moments that mirror my life often come alive on my commutes. For example, the drummers resemble the five siblings in the family I worked with during my first service trip to the Appalachian Mountains the summer before my sophomore year. I decide to drop money in the youngest drummers' container and I see a joy spread across the boy's face, reminding me of children I met on that trip.School for me does not start in the classroom. My lessons begin the minute I leave my house. My commute now shapes my identity in ways I never imagined when I decided to attend high school in the heart of Chicago.It starts with a 15-minute ride with dad to the Metra Station, followed by a 20-minute train ride to the heart of the city. On the train, I witness an architectural transition as buildings become higher and closer together, complimenting the fast pace enveloping everyone.I arrive downtown and my commute continues. I now walk the morning rush with Chicagoans of all races and classes as I head to the CTA bus stop a couple of minutes away. The world becomes larger, then smaller with this walk. By the time I reach the bus stop, I find classmates coming from different places for the final 15-minute bus ride.On one ride, I smell liquor on the breath of a man sitting a few rows away. He is lanky with scruffy facial hair, wearing a green army jacket, and holding a brown paper bag. It is the week after Christmas break. 'Tis the season to join classmates and complain about homework loads. I describe my long paper on the role of children in the Civil Rights Movement when the smell of the man's breath comes closer. He then begins scolding all the kids on the bus saying: ""Ya'll kids shouldn't be complaining about homework. I didn't do none of my homework when I was your age and look at me now. Do that homework. Stay in school. Graduate. Make something of yourselves.""By then, I was a seasoned commuter. If this happened before high school, I would have felt uncomfortable in my seat and searched for another one towards the front of the bus. Instead, I nodded at the man's helpful advice.Some scenes of my commute are as entertaining as a movie, yet my imagination must write the script. I was waiting at the bus stop one morning when I saw a businessman in a full suit and tie riding by on his scooter. Maybe he was a creative entrepreneur, or just a man trying to save money rather than taking a cab. I could only imagine a day in his life.I never imagined how adaptable my commute would make me. On one cold January morning, the bus broke down. The driver said another bus would arrive in an hour. My classmates and I decided to walk so we would not be late for school. A brisk wind hit our faces as it became harder to see, and the cold made our noses drip and turned our faces red. Too bad the man with the brown paper bag could not see our walk through deep snow in single-digit temperature weather. It showed the kind of academic commitment that might warm his heart.My commute has strengthened my independence and adjustment to new situations. I now go downtown not only for school, but for other events as well. Thanks to my commute, I have branched beyond a suburban bubble and become more aware of myself as part of a larger community.Jordan Harris, a freshman at Northwestern University, is a 2014 graduate of Saint Ignatius College Prep."

Those appeals were unsuccessful. Sprouse reportedly had no pending last-minute appeals ahead of his execution. In 2002, Sprouse exited a Dallas-area gas station with a shotgun and fired in the direction of two men nearby. Witnesses testified that Sprouse appeared to have some trouble with his car before he shot and killed Moreno, who was pumping gas nearby. Steinfeldt responded to the scene and was shot twice by Sprouse. Though Steinfeldt was able to return fire and injure Sprouse, he died of his injuries.Court records show Sprouse confessed to the officer who transported him to the hospital. Sprouse said he thought Moreno was an undercover cop who was following him and confessed to shooting him. ""I shot the other officer that was in uniform,"" Sprouse reportedly told the officer.Defense attorneys were unable to convince the jury to weigh Sprouse's intoxication --he tested positive for methamphetamine -- as a defense or a mitigating factor to spare him the death penalty. According to court records, friends and family suspected that Sprouse might be mentally ill, testifying he claimed to see dead people, talked to himself and said people were out to get him. Sprouse's mother testified that her son thought that people were talking to him through the television, and thought that the CIA and FBI wanted to kill him.""He started hitting the meth and went crazy,"" Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, told The Associated Press. ""Even his family was afraid of him."" Sprouse was potentially facing a postponement when the TDCJ revealed in early March it was running low on the chemical pentobarbital that it uses for lethal injections. As big drug manufacturers cut off their supply to prisons, corrections departments are increasingly turning to local compounding pharmacies for their supply. By mid-March, the TDCJ was able to secure a new supply, but like all other states with lethal injection, did not disclose the specific source. ""The drugs were purchased from a licensed pharmacy that has the ability to compound,"" TDCJ Spokesman Jason Clark said in a statement. Dwindling drug supplies -- and growing opposition from leading pharmacist groups that could compound the chemicals -- have forced other states to halt executions and rush to legalize alternative methods. Georgia halted executions in March after its supply of pentobarbital appeared ""cloudy,"" while Utah reinstated the firing squad should lethal injection chemicals become unavailable. Earlier on Tuesday, the Oklahoma legislature approved a measure to reinstate a form of the gas chamber. The Texas Coalition To Abolish The Death Penalty Executive Director Kristin Houlé told The Huffington Post Tuesday that her group continues to oppose all executions and will be holding vigils for Sprouse around the state Thursday.""Texas has scheduled four executions to take place this month,"" Houlé said. ""This is occurring at the time when there's growing opposition to the death penalty and executions are on hold in many other states."" "

32,POLITICS,State AGs Urge Federal Forgiveness Of Student Loans Tied To Dodgy For-Profit Chain,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-student-loan-forgiveness_n_7037128.html,,2015-04-10,"NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 16: Arne Duncan, U.S. Secretary of Education, speaks at a press conference announcing that Starbucks will partner with Arizona State University to offer full tuition reimbursement for Starbucks employees to complete a bachelor's degree, on June 16, 2014 in New York City. The offer will be made to both full-time and part-time employees through online classes. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f1f22200005700dd83de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Top state prosecutors from Oregon to Massachusetts, who contend they have evidence that thousands of Americans were fraudulently urged to take out federal student loans to attend dodgy for-profit schools, urged the U.S. Department of Education on Thursday to forgive the borrowers’ debts.The group of nine Democratic attorneys general demanded that Education Secretary Arne Duncan use his existing authority to cancel debts for students who attended schools currently or formerly owned by Corinthian Colleges Inc., a once-multibillion-dollar company that owned more than 100 for-profit schools with names such as Everest, Heald and Wyotech.The Thursday letter follows similar requests made by Senate Democrats and appeals from consumer groups, such as the National Consumer Law Center, that the Education Department grant debt relief to those who attended Corinthian’s schools.The U.S. Department of Justice, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and authorities in most states have all either sued the company for allegedly misleading students into taking out loans -- by advertising false job prospects or graduation rates -- or begun investigations based on such claims.“Corinthian continues to dispute the allegations made against it and continues to believe its schools provide significant value for its students,” Joe Hixson, a spokesman for Corinthian at Abernathy MacGregor Group, said in an emailed statement. “These allegations focus on isolated incidents and ignore that for many years, tens of thousands of Corinthian graduates completed their studies, were certified in their areas of study and obtained employment in their chosen field.”Last year, the company struck a deal with the Education Department to either sell off or close all its campuses in return for the schools' continued access to federal student aid. Earlier this year, it finalized an Education Department-brokered deal to sell most of its U.S. campuses to an Education Department debt collector.Meanwhile, former students burdened with federal student loans either have to repay their debts or face the devastating consequences of a default.“These cases against Corinthian have unmasked a school that relentlessly pursued potential students -- including veterans, single parents, and first-time higher education seekers -- promising jobs and high earnings, and preying on their hopes in an effort to secure federal funds,” the attorneys general from Massachusetts, Kentucky, Oregon, New Mexico, Connecticut, California, Illinois, New York and Washington state wrote in their Thursday letter to Duncan. “These students deserve relief.”""The department shares the attorneys general’s concern for the welfare of Corinthian students and we look forward to responding to their letter,"" Denise Horn, an Education Department spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement.Hixson said Corinthian’s schools “provide educational opportunity to historically underserved student populations and many campuses are located in low-income communities that other institutions simply do not serve. ... [W]e fill a large gap in our country’s education system that the public sector has failed to address.”He added, “We object to mischaracterizations of our job placement efforts and the suggestion that we misrepresented these efforts. The letter makes references to ‘findings of a state attorney general.’ It is important to note the difference between findings and allegations -- a number of state AGs have made allegations but as these cases are still in progress, it would be inappropriate to presume guilt without due process.” The request from state attorneys general, who have been called “the people’s lawyers” because of their role protecting consumers, stems from a provision in federal law that allows borrowers with federal student loans to formally apply for their debts to be forgiven if their school cheated them into taking on the debt. The provision is also written into the contracts that students sign with the government when they take out the loans.Borrowers need only assert that their school violated their state’s law and that the violation played a role in their taking out the student loan. For example, if a school advertised false job placement rates for a nursing program and those claims influenced a person to enroll and take out federal student loans, that person could later apply for the debt to be canceled.In December, 13 Senate Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Dick Durbin of Illinois, urged the Education Department to use this provision to forgive debts incurred by Corinthian students. They pointed to the lawsuits filed by state prosecutors and the federal consumer bureau.In February, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey asked Duncan to acknowledge the evidence her office has gathered in documenting Corinthian's alleged frauds and cancel debts taken out to attend Corinthian schools in her state.""Schools should not obtain public monies based on actions in violation of state law, and students should not be required to pay for such violations,"" Healey said at the time.Last month, activists born out of the Occupy Wall Street movement began collecting debt relief applications from former Corinthian students that reference state and federal allegations. They’ve collected about 650 in the last two weeks, said Luke Herrine, one of the organizers.More than 100 former Corinthian students are publicly refusing to repay their federal student loans as part of a “debt strike” to try to force the Education Department to forgive debts incurred by all former Corinthian students. Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, has said she supports the debt strikers.The state attorneys general argue that there’s no reason for the Education Department to delay its decision on canceling loans. In an interview Thursday, Healey said the department should act today.“We believe legal authority exists right now that once an attorney general has conducted an investigation and made a finding, that is sufficient for [the Education Department] to take action and discharge these loans,” Healey said.Close to 4,000 students owe the Education Department around $8 million on loans taken out in the last four years to attend Corinthian’s schools in Massachusetts alone, Healey added.Healey and the other attorneys general warned in their letter that the Education Department needs to act because Corinthian is facing financial failure, and authorities are unlikely to wring enough money out of the company to help aggrieved former students. The company’s troubles stem from its Education Department agreement, as well as multiplying government probes and declining student enrollment.The Education Department has originated about $4 billion in loans for students at Corinthian campuses since the start of the 2010-2011 academic year, department data show. Were it to erase some or all of that debt, the Education Department would similarly face difficulties in trying to recoup the money from Corinthian. The company is trying to sell off its assets.But the losses the department would face in such a situation pale in comparison to the enormous profits it has generated off the federal student loan program.Since 1992, student loans have generated an estimated $66 billion in profits for U.S. taxpayers, White House budget documents show. The profits are largely due to the high rates of interest borrowers pay on older federal loans. The profit figure takes into account losses from past loan defaults, but also is based on projections of how, when and whether current borrowers will repay their debts.Last month, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that new federal student loans will produce tens of billions of dollars in additional profits over the coming decade.In a Feb. 25 letter to Duncan, six Senate Democrats, including Warren and Ohio's Sherrod Brown, argued that such profits are evidence of an Education Department failing to ensure that student borrowers are treated fairly.“Much of this revenue will be collected as a direct consequence of the department's failure to implement congressional directives or to utilize its discretionary authority to protect our most vulnerable borrowers,” the senators said. “It is not the job of the Department of Education to maximize profits for the government at the cost of squeezing students who are struggling to get an education.”This post was updated Friday morning with a response from the Education Department."
33,ENTERTAINMENT,"Oscar Isaac Somehow Finds A Way To Link Disco, 'Star Wars' And Robots",E. Oliver Whitney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oscar-isaac-star-wars-dancing_n_7037140.html,,2015-04-10,"NEW YORK, NY - APRIL 06: Oscar Isaac attends 'Ex Machina' New York Premiere at Crosby Street Hotel on April 6, 2015 in New York City. (Photo by Rob Kim/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4b10d220000ba01dc2ec5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Oscar Isaac is a name that’s become more familiar over the past several years. You likely first noticed the actor in 2010’s “Sucker Punch” or as Carey Mulligan’s boyfriend in “Drive."" Since then, Isaac has earned a Golden Globe nomination for “Inside Llewyn Davis,” received high praise for his performance alongside Jessica Chastain in “A Most Violent Year” and is appearing in J.J. Abrams’ upcoming “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” While the actor has said little about his ""Star Wars"" character, X-wing pilot Poe Dameron, The Huffington Post still asked him about the franchise while he was in New York promoting his latest film, “Ex Machina.” As a fan of the space opera series, what classic “Star Wars” scene would Isaac want to be in? The cantina scene from ""Episode IV."" ""I could be one of the musicians in the background,” Isaac said as he imitated playing a set of bongos.The actor’s musical abilities are far from news, though. Isaac showcased his singing and guitar skills when portraying fictional folk singer Llewyn Davis in the Coen Brothers’ 2013 film. Now, Isaac is unveiling another talent in Alex Garland’s “Ex Machina” during a scene that is at once unnerving and wildly fun: disco dancing. In the film, Isaac’s Nathan, a reclusive tech genius, has built an artificially intelligent robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander). He invites one of his company’s coding employees, Caleb (Domhall Gleeson), to his home to conduct a Turing Test on Ava, which in layman’s terms is to determine whether or not Ava can fully think like a human. During his week-long visit, Caleb gets into drunken philosophical discussions with Nathan about consciousness (the most fascinating part of the script for Isaac), grows close with Ava, and gets swept into watching Nathan and his female companion break out into a full-on choreographed dance (watch it here) to Oliver Cheatham's ""Get Down Saturday Night.""“That was just Alex [Garland] being smart as far as keeping everybody off balance,” Isaac said of the disco non-sequitur. “That was a moment, from a rhythm standpoint, that you needed to get a complete 180. But completely logical if you think about this guy who’s been [in his home] for years without any human beings and makes these robots and fucks these robots. What else is he gonna do with them? Dance with them!” That’s exactly what Isaac does, or as Nathan puts it in the film, “I’m going to tear up the fucking dance floor dude, check it out.” The choreography only lasts for less than a minute in “Ex Machina,” but Isaac told us that the dance was originally twice as long. It did take him a couple weeks to learn, though. “Not a natural disco dancer,” Isaac said with a laugh. Maybe we'll see Isaac's pilot teach the Mos Eisley band some dance moves in ""Episode VII,"" if we're lucky.“Ex Machina” is now playing in select theaters."
