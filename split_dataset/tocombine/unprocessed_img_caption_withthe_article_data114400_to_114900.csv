0,BUSINESS,3 Surefire Ways to Increase the Reach of Your Blog Posts,"Matthew Collis, ContributorDigital communications professional",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-surefire-ways-to-increa_b_5626765.html,In this article I'll outline three great ways you can increase traffic to your blog and get more eyeballs reading your content.,2014-07-28,2014-07-28-Makeyourblogpostsgoviralwithbestpractices.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-28-Makeyourblogpostsgoviralwithbestpractices-thumb.jpg," Are you looking to get more people reading your blog posts? Wondering how to supercharge their reach and get a consistent flow of new subscribers? In this article I'll outline three great ways you can increase traffic to your blog and get more eyeballs reading your content.1. Promote your post across multiple social media sitesPromote your blog post across as many social media channels you feel it could work on. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Plus, Pinterest, and Reddit can be great ones to focus in on. With Twitter, it's a good idea to use a tool like Buffer or Hootsuite to schedule multiple tweets throughout the week about the particular post. With LinkedIn, you'll want to promote it on your company page, personal LinkedIn profile, and in relevant groups.I also recommend creating your own LinkedIn group. As a LinkedIn group manager, you have the ability to send out an email to every group member. Remember, you personally don't have these people's email addresses so it's valuable that you're still able to get a message directly into their inbox via LinkedIn. You may want to send an email about a white paper or e-book you created that will help your members with such and such.Moreover, it's useful to consider paid ads, such as promoting a tweet or boosting a Facebook post, across your social sites. This will ensure you get more people reading the social media update and clicking on the link to your blog article. With Facebook's most recent algorithm changes, paid ads are becoming increasingly more essential in getting your updates seen. Lastly, be sure to give readers the ability to share your blog posts on the social media site of their choice.2. Promote your post in relevant communities and forumsFind out which communities and forums your target audience is involved with. Then make an effort to become a part of these communities by sharing helpful tips and ideas, engaging in discussion, and answering questions. If you or someone on your team just wrote a blog post that you think the community can benefit from, go ahead and share it with them. You may get people replying to the thread with questions or comments, and if so, be sure to respond to each one of them.You don't want to take the wrong approach here, which would be to simply register on a forum and then blast out your blog posts each time one is published, regardless of its relevancy and without engaging in any discussion with other members. 3. Leverage your email listBe sure you make it easy for people to subscribe to your blog. This means having a subscribe form above the fold with a clear and compelling call-to-action. You may want to incentivize people to subscribe to your blog by offering a free guide or e-Book once they do. When a new post is published, send an email update to your list with a snippet of it and a link to read the full article on your blog. Your goal should be to get the email address of every relevant visitor to your blog. A large and growing list of subscribers means that you're boosting the likelihood of your posts being seen by as many people as possible. Make certain that your subscribers can easily share your email with their friends or family on their social media sites. And here's a tip: pick a few of your best performing or most popular blog posts and highlight them in your company's monthly e-Newsletter.In addition, another great email promotion strategy is to reach out to key influencers who could benefit from a particular post and share it with them. As well, contact anyone mentioned in the article (or any company you linked to) and let them know about it. You'll find that this could be an excellent way to help the post go viral or at least generate more traffic.Build greater awareness of your blog using the techniques I discussed in this article. Over time, you'll find that your traffic will increase and your posts will have the chance to get you the business results you're looking for."

(AP Photo/Pat Sullivan, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d4226a3b00009d27ec7e7f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Arizona's recent botched execution of Joseph Wood is the latest in a series of horrific events demonstrating that lethal injection is a profoundly flawed method for carrying out capital punishment. Similar to Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma and Dennis McGuire in Ohio, Wood endured excruciating suffering during the hour and 52 minutes it took for the drugs administered by the state's executioners to end his life.Wood almost avoided this deeply inhumane death. In the days preceding his execution, his attorneys mounted an impressive campaign to overturn a lower court order denying him access to basic information about the qualifications of the executioners and the source of the drugs to be used. Wood argued that he had a First Amendment right of access to such information. On Monday, July 21, a panel of the Ninth Circuit federal appeals court concluded that Arizona must either turn over the information Wood sought, or else delay the execution. The Ninth Circuit panel voted 2-1 (with a dissent from Judge Jay Bybee, who is no stranger to government-sponsored cruelty) that Wood had raised a legitimate First Amendment claim and would suffer irreparable harm if an injunction against his execution were not granted. But rather than either providing Wood with the information or delaying the execution, Arizona instead petitioned the Supreme Court, which overruled the Ninth Circuit and held that the execution could proceed.Death penalty lawyers are often accused of engaging in frivolous delaying tactics. We hear about delays in executions. We witness California's death penalty held unconstitutional, in part, because of delay. But in Wood's case, these claims of delay distract from the real issue. Faced with shortages of the components of the previous three-drug execution cocktail of choice, states have begun to experiment with different doses and types of drugs, and the qualifications of executioners are not getting any better. In the rush to continue with executions, Arizona and other states are using their execution chambers as laboratories for human experimentation. Departments of Correction are trying to figure out what combination will create the most aesthetically pleasing execution for public consumption, while obscuring from public scrutiny what drugs they are using and what training they provide their executioners. In the meantime, lawyers and their clients are rightly concerned about the unnecessary suffering that flows from these experiments. The execution team is not exactly comprised of faculty from Harvard Medical School. Quite the contrary: executioners may have well less than a week of medical training under their belt when they set out to experiment with new cocktails for killing. Not surprisingly, sometimes problems result from the hodgepodge of drugs a state can obtain and coupled with the low level of training for executioners. In April, Oklahoma badly botched the execution of Clayton Lockett and independent autopsies show that the persons conducting the execution had ""no clue what they were doing.""So in the shadow of several recently bungled executions, it was far from frivolous for the next person in line for execution by lethal injection in a state with non-public execution procedures to inquire about the drugs and training of the persons to be used for the execution. But attorneys representing death row inmates face an impossible dilemma. Because states routinely modify and amend their execution protocols up to the last minute, lawyers cannot challenge a state's lethal injection procedures earlier in the process because federal courts will invariably dismiss the claims as having been brought prematurely. On the other hand, if lawyers wait for the state to issue the warrant for execution, critics accuse them of gaming the system by waiting until the last minute. Lawyers' only realistic option is to file close to the time of execution and hope for the best. Yet this whole problem could be avoided if states would make their execution processes transparent. Arizona's lack of transparency led to Wood's legal challenge, and, ultimately, the Ninth Circuit opinion enjoining his execution. The court's decision immediately attracted criticism from legal commentators such as Orin Kerr, who contended that the Ninth Circuit lacked the authority to enjoin the execution because the ""plaintiff is not trying to enjoin the allegedly unlawful act""--in other words, Wood is not really trying to prevent the state from suppressing information relating to his execution. Instead, Kerr argued, ""the plaintiff is trying to enjoin his execution -- something that is not being challenged here as unlawful."" In other words, Kerr objected to the injunction because Wood's lawsuit was based on a potential First Amendment violation, when (in his view) a criminal or habeas corpus proceeding asserting an Eighth Amendment violation was the appropriate way to seek a stay of the execution.But as even Kerr conceded, there was a ""practical connection"" between the injunction against the execution and the opportunity for Wood to pursue the First Amendment claim that would provide him with information about the procedures to be used in his execution. Without such information, it would be impossible for Wood's lawyers to assess whether the execution might violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. But that information would do him no good after his death. Once the Ninth Circuit determined that Wood asserted a legitimate First Amendment claim, the injunction was necessary to allow him to pursue the claim. To be sure, stays of execution are equitable remedies, which courts provide at their discretion, rather than remedies available as a matter of right. But surely a federal court considering whether to award such a remedy has wide latitude to prevent an irreversible harm no matter how the remedy is technically categorized.Wood's request for relief was framed as an injunction against the execution based on his First Amendment claim, and this may seem incongruous to Kerr and others. But these commentators are simply wrong to conclude that the Ninth Circuit could not accomplish in one step something that would be clearly permissible if spread out over two judicial procedures--a First Amendment ""injunction"" in one case, and a ""stay"" of execution in a separate proceeding. Such reasoning privileges finicky academic commentary at the expense of practical justice.One might debate the merits of First Amendment right of access claims such as the one Wood brought. We think they are colorable. But to argue against granting a stay is misguided. Such arguments effectively consigned Wood to suffer an agonizing two-hour execution because of the formalistic distinction between an injunction on his First Amendment claim and the corresponding stay of execution necessary to permit that injunction to be carried out. Whether or not one believes in capital punishment, Wood did not deserve a painful, two-hour execution in service of abstract and contestable legal principles.by Justin Marceau and Alan K. Chen.

2,BUSINESS,The Tradeoff Between Inflation and Unemployment: What We Don't Know Can Hurt Us,"Jared Bernstein, ContributorFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-tradeoff-between-infl_1_b_5626857.html,"To assert that economists are having trouble figuring out the relationship between inflation and unemployment is like saying chefs can't figure out what to do with salt and pepper. It's that fundamental. Yet, we're befuddled, and that has powerful policy implications.",2014-07-28,"Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen prepares to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on monetary policy and the state of the economy on July 16, 2014 in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. AFP PHOTO/Mandel NGAN (Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb311491f0000390123bf42.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To assert that economists are having trouble figuring out the relationship between inflation and unemployment is like saying chefs can't figure out what to do with salt and pepper. It's that fundamental. Yet, we're befuddled, and that has powerful policy implications.For example, a prominent macro economist recently suggested to me that we must have been at full employment for the past 20 years, because inflation has essentially hovered around the Fed's target of 2% since then (average core PCE, year-over-year, since 1994: 1.7%; standard deviation: 0.4%). If output gaps truly persisted, then inflation should have fallen well below this band; if we were overheated, vice versa.Given the obvious absence of full employment in recent years, I think his point was really that traditional relationships between critical variables are shifting in ways we don't understand. And given how large this relationship looms both as a policy determinant at the Fed and in understanding the dynamics behind their mandate to balance full employment and price stability, this is a serious problem.To be clear, in discussing our lack of understanding of the unemployment/inflation tradeoff, I'm not talking about the rabid inflation hawks who've been tilting at an inflationary phantom for years now, though they're not a trivial group. I recently testified in Congress alongside my old friend Larry Kudlow, who called the fact that inflation has been quiescent ""miraculous."" As Paul Krugman noted about this interpretation: ""It's not something wrong with my model. It's a miracle!"" (To give Larry credit, at least he's not veering into the wing-nuttery claim that the statistical agencies are cooking the books.)I'm thinking about the rest of us, starting at the top--with the Fed--who are struggling to figure out the nature of the tradeoff as the Fed begins to contemplate unwinding. Given Chair Yellen's (very appropriate) focus on job-market slack and thus her up-weighting of the full employment side of the mandate, there's clearly some anxiety building around the potential for overshooting on inflation.A big part of the problem is the evolution of the inverse relationship between unemployment and price growth, i.e., the flattening of the Phillips curve, implying a reduced negative correlation between inflation and unemployment. This phenomenon is by now fairly well known; the figure below (see here for more explanation) shows how much the correlation has diminished over time.Source: author's analysis of Ball/Mazumder model.Why has it flattened so much? The Fed has done a good job of convincing people that it will keep inflation ""well-anchored"" no matter what else is going on, higher inequality means stickier wages, globalization has reduced supply constraints, and especially in recent years, the unemployment rate is widely regarded as an inadequate measure of slack.One implication of this, as David Mericle of Goldman Sachs Research recently wrote (no link) is that ""...looking ahead, the flattening of the Phillips curve implies that the inflation costs of misjudging slack--however measured--are likely to be smaller than in the past.""Of course, one could argue that another implication is that if inflation did start to climb quickly, ""flat Phil"" also means that it would be harder to slow inflation through higher unemployment. That's possible, but the above list of ""flattening factors"" is pointing solidly in the other direction. In fact, I'd say the experience of the 20 years suggests an anti-inflation bias in most advanced economies, with Japan of course leading the pack.To be clear, I think the unemployment/inflation tradeoff lives on--I don't believe the zero at the end of that Phillips curve figure above. But I'm afraid that's about the extent of what we know right now.A related problem, noted above, is how to measure slack, the key input into this relationship. Given the decline in the labor force, a phenomenon partly driven by weak demand, the unemployment rate is a less reliable indicator (you're only counted as unemployed if you're actively searching for a job). That's led the Fed to adopt a ""dashboard"" approach, involving a plethora of indicators, including underemployment, new hires, payroll growth, wage trends, and more.I think that's both smart and necessary, but it further complicates our understanding of the tradeoff and makes it harder for us to understand what the Fed is up to (remember when they blew by their erstwhile 6.5% unemployment target?). Mericle evaluates the state of the dashboard indicators and finds something quite interesting: the level indicators, like underemployment or the quits rate, are still below their target ranges. But the rate-of-change indicators, like payroll growth, are much closer to the target.By this analysis, there's still too much slack but it's closing at a decent clip. How does that map onto inflationary pressures? Who knows?!Next, pretend for a moment that the unemployment rate accurately reflects labor market conditions. To assess the extent of slack, you still need an estimate of the lowest unemployment rate consistent with stable prices (the so-called ""structural rate""). And that number, which changes over time, is elusive to say the least. While economists still crank out such estimates with abandon (even adding numerous decimal points, just to show we've got a sense of humor), Dean Baker and I recently pointed out that the confidence interval around these guesses is a whopping four percentage points.Moreover, like I said, it moves. Mericle prints the figure below showing Fed staff estimates of the structural rate over time, from the mid-6's to the high 4's.Source: David Mericle, GS Research; Philadelphia Fed.One begins to see how challenging this question of inflation and unemployment has become. The world has changed in ways that both significantly alter this relationship and make it harder to measure. Importantly, those global changes are not random: they lean towards a weaker correlation between slack and price pressures.So what's the best way forward? First, as the increased analytic scope at the Fed has shown, the simple, two-variable Phillips curve may be a tired, old macroeconomic war horse that should be put out to pasture if not sent to the glue factory. It simply can no longer provide the guidance we need.Second, as I've stressed throughout, the history of inflation in recent decades suggests that risk of overshooting is diminished, and even if we do, there's nothing wrong with slightly higher inflation (there is, of course, a problem with spiraling price growth, but the factors holding down inflation--anchoring by the Fed, global supply chains, restrained wage growth--lower that risk). Conversely, the risk of persistently slack job markets is seen and felt by millions every day, and not just for the millions still unemployed and underemployed, but in the paychecks of the vast majority of the workforce.Simply put, we cannot afford to continue to sacrifice the goal of full employment at the altar of an inflation hawkery that is increasingly out of step with both the data and the changes in the historical relationship between unemployment and price pressures. To their great credit, the Yellen Fed seems to get this, but as time progresses and prices firm--as I said, that correlation isn't really zero--they'll be hearing a lot about ""overshoot risk."" An honest assessment of what we know should lead them to discount that risk as they keep their eyes on the dashboard and their feet gingerly on the gas.This post originally appeared at Jared Bernstein's On The Economy blog."
3,IMPACT,"World Hepatitis Day Is an Opportunity to Stop This Silent Killer, Once and For All","Hande Harmanci, ContributorMedical officer, Global Hepatitis Program at the World Health ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/world-hepatitis-day-is-an_b_5626861.html,"I was stunned when I learned that hepatitis kills 1.4 million people every year, making it one of the world's top-10 killers along with ischemic heart disease, HIV/AIDS and lung cancer.",2014-07-28,"LEYTE, PHILIPPINES - NOVEMBER 18: An old woman is given anti Hepatitis A shots during a medical mission on November 18, 2013 in Tacloban, Leyte, Philippines. Typhoon Haiyan, which ripped through the Philippines on November 9, has been described as one of the most powerful typhoons ever to hit land, leaving thousands dead and hundreds of thousands homeless. Countries all over the world have pledged relief aid to help support those affected by the typhoon, however damage to the airport and roads have made moving the aid into the most affected areas very difficult. With dead bodies left out in the open air and very limited food, water and shelter, health concerns are growing. (Photo by Dondi Tawatao/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1c911240000300096e138.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I so vividly remember one of my earliest encounters with viral hepatitis. I was working in Hacettepe University Hospital in Turkey when a seriously ill old woman was admitted. Her belly was swollen -- the size of a full-term pregnancy -- but there was no baby. Her abdomen was full of fluids because her liver had stopped functioning properly. She was dying from chronic liver disease due to viral hepatitis.Viral hepatitis -- a group of infectious diseases caused by hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses -- can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer, both horrible diseases to have -- and to die from.It was years before I learned quite how many people there are in the world living with chronic hepatitis. By comparison, there are 34 million people living with HIV, while there are 390 million people living with chronic hepatitis. I was stunned when I learned that hepatitis kills 1.4 million people every year, making it one of the world's top-10 killers along with ischemic heart disease, HIV/AIDS and lung cancer. One reason for this is that most people do not develop hepatitis symptoms until it is too late, when liver disease has already set in - and they have already passed on the virus to others. That's why, on World Hepatitis Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) is urging people to ""think again"" about how they live their lives, so they are better able to avoid the different hepatitis viruses, and know what to do if they think they may be infected. Key things to avoid are unsterile medical equipment -- particularly for injections -- and unprotected sex, as well as unsafe water and food. It is important to get tested if you have had a blood transfusion somewhere where blood is not screened for hepatitis, if you have shared syringes or needles or if you had unprotected sex. Get tested so you can be treated if need be.The good news is that we are beginning to see a new momentum around hepatitis. Politicians are starting to take it seriously: at the World Health Assembly this May, 194 governments agreed to a new resolution to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of viral hepatitis.New medicines are appearing. Earlier this month, the Government of Egypt reached agreement with a company producing new oral medicines to treat hepatitis C. The new drugs promise higher cure rates, are less toxic and have fewer side effects than existing medications. But prices are high. This agreement enables Egypt, where at least 1 in 10 of the population aged 15 to 59 is infected with hepatitis C, to purchase the treatments at significantly reduced cost.And just this week, WHO has released a new manual to help health workers tackle outbreaks of Hepatitis E. This virus can cause large outbreaks in locations that lack safe water, for example, in refugee camps. Hepatitis E is particularly dangerous for pregnant women: it can provoke pregnancy and birth-related complications -- killing one in five women who become ill with the virus, especially in the last three months of pregnancyWorld Hepatitis Day is an opportunity for the global community to respond to the call to action issued at a WHO-organized meeting of people working on and affected by hepatitis. Representatives of all participating organizations signed up to a call for immediate and concerted action to scale up the global hepatitis response. There is something each one of us can do -- at the very minimum by adding our voices to those raising awareness about the disease so more people know how to avoid becoming infected and to encourage policy makers to do more to tackle it -- and to end this ""silent killer"" once and for all.To learn more about hepatitis worldwide and what you can do to help, please visit here."

In fact, this concept is the very essence of what the art world constantly seeks to investigate.",2014-07-28,2014-07-28-KoonsPhoto2AymannIsmail_ANIMALNewYork.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-28-KoonsPhoto2AymannIsmail_ANIMALNewYork-thumb.jpg,"Jeff Koons and Kara Walker are far from the first artists to explore the concept of life and death in their artwork. In fact, this concept is the very essence of what the art world constantly seeks to investigate. These artists have both examined this topic by creating and controlling temporary installations that evolve with time. This, in turn, broadens the audience's experience of their work.Jeff Koons intentionally encourages the growth of the flowers on Split-Rocker, and Kara Walker deliberately let A Subtlety evolve by allowing its sugar-coated sculptures to melt. They both use the temporary fate of their chosen medium to make a statement about life and death.Split-Rocker, currently at Rockefeller Center, is a toy horse- and dino-shaped metal structure covered with flowers. Though there is an internal watering system built into it, the reality of its most significant component remains that flowers always have the potential to grow, wither and/or die along the way. The very essence of the piece and its circumstances don't allow it to exist beyond its intended state or beyond the potential of its expanded state. (photo credit: Aymann Ismail via ANIMAL New York)With the innocent imagery of a child's toy horse as his figurative mask, Koons plays with the idea of life and death -- the flowers can symbolize the frailty of life, while the water system ""toys"" with the predictability of death. Koons' control of the installation with an irrigation system is a way of encouraging the growth, and preventing the inevitable death, of the flowers. The flowers' demise always remains just under the surface of examination.Kara Walker's A Subtlety, which closed earlier this month after causing quite a stir at the ill-fated Domino Sugar Refinery in Brooklyn, featured a massive African female sphinx sculpture surrounded by smaller child-like sculptures. All were coated in sugar or molasses. The exhibition was as different as night and day from Split-Rocker. That said, much like Koons' flowers, A Subtlety was made from a medium that had the potential to -- and did -- melt, collapse and disfigure the original pieces. (photo source: CreativeTime.com)  Incidentally, Walker plays with the idea of life and death as well -- albeit in a more intensely symbolic and historically-rich way than Koons. While Split-Rocker's water system was put into place to prevent the flowers from changing with time, Walker embraced the inevitability of time and decay. In fact, it was directly related to her message -- the sculpture recalls the cane fields in which African slaves labored. ""I knew that the candy wouldn't last."" Walker told NPR. ""That was part of the point. That [the sculptures] were going to be in this non-climate-controlled space, slowly melting away and disintegrating."" The ""death"" of sugar sculptures inside a soon-to-be-demolished sugar refinery, and the representation of the African slave as a commentary of the history of the sugar trade, gives A Subtlety an added level of meaning.Work that develops beyond the original form created by the artist, even when that change is intended, removes control from the artist and instead transfers it to nature and the environment. This commands an important shift of focus from the artist's intent to the audience's experience: an evolving work provides an evolving or varied experience. The audience is further challenged and enriched when the scope of a piece changes from one day to the next. For example, those visiting A Subtlety later in the exhibition would have witnessed the melting of sculptures unlike those who visited earlier, thereby experiencing the installation in a much different way. (Of course, this is not only true for public art. Remember when Yoko Ono exhibited a rotting apple?)The impermanence introduces an element to the work that, due to its fleeting nature, is almost interactive. Provocative dance pieces and moving theatrical performances remain memorable despite the fact that they are momentary. The idea that the pieces will only exist temporarily makes it more immediate and speaks to a moment in time. How apropos for these two pieces that examine life and death. Perhaps it's even more powerful when works like these slip into the ether. Its brief life span, when anchored with intense meaning, makes them all the more precious. Though fleeting and impermanent in physical form, their stamp on the art world has the potential to stick for quite some time."

But a slew of recent national polls show that three-quarters of all Americans disapprove of the job Congress is doing. Together these polls reflect enormous dissatisfaction with Washington. Nonetheless, Republicans, even those in Congress, have been unrelenting in their attacks on President Obama. Since Obama's first day in office in January 2009 Congressional Republicans have done all they can to block President Obama. Worse, they have consistently done all they can to delegitimize the Obama presidency at all costs. They have put party politics ahead of the well being of the American people. Politics in America has always been a rough and tumble profession. But, with the emergence of powerful conservative media outlets, the country has become more divided. Calls for presidential impeachment have cast a shadow over most modern-day presidents. However, the chorus of impeachers seems louder in the past year. A recent poll by CNN/ORC found that 57% of Republicans support impeaching Obama, while just 35% of independents and 13% of Democrats support such an action. The United States Constitution states, ""The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors."" Some Republicans point to Benghazi and the failure to secure America's southern border as reasons to impeach Obama. Others cite Obama's use of executive orders as an abuse of power. But President George W. Bush issued an executive order every 10 days, President Ronald Reagan issued an executive order every seven days, and President Jimmy Carter issued one every five days. In fact, Obama's rate of executive orders is the lowest since President Grover Cleveland. In the near future, President Obama will likely take action to change immigration laws, a hot-button issue for Republicans who have blocked all efforts for meaningful reform. White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer, speaking at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast last week, said, ""It would be foolish to discount the possibility that Republicans would think about going down that path."" But many Republicans think it would be foolish to pursue impeachment. They remember that right after the House voted to impeach President Bill Clinton in 1998, for perjury and obstruction of justice, his approval rating surged 10 points to 73% in a Gallup Poll. In mid July Republican House Judiciary Committee chairman Robert Goodlatte of Virginia said on ABC's This Week, ""We are not working on or drawing up articles of impeachment."" He added, ""The Constitution is very clear as to what constitutes grounds for impeachment of the president of the United States. He (Obama) has not committed the kind of criminal acts that call for that."" Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner, who has said he disagrees with impeachment, has moved ahead with plans to sue the president over his use of executive powers. Specifically, Boehner is suing the president for failing to execute the health care law by delaying the law's employer mandates. This is the same healthcare law House Republicans have voted more than 50 times to repeal. The Boehner lawsuit and talk of impeachment have given Democrats an opportunity to increase fundraising efforts. Last week House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi emailed supporters, ""Yesterday, for the first time in history, Congress voted to sue a sitting president. Today, the White House alerted us that they believe 'Speaker Boehner ... has opened the door to impeachment.'"" Democrats face many difficult midterm elections this November, and may lose control of the Senate. Ten years ago then-Senator Barack Obama made a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention that would win him broad acclaim. ""Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes,"" Obama said.

7,POLITICS,Leaked Memo Tells Senate Candidate To Spend 80 Percent Of Her Time Raising Money,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-nunn-fundraising_n_5628018.html,,2014-07-28,"Democratic senatorial candidate Michelle Nunn, the former CEO of Points of Light from Atlanta, participates in a debate at the Georgia Public Broadcasting studio, Sunday, May 11, 2014, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/David Tulis)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d0d31f0000400225731f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A campaign strategy memo prepared for Georgia Democratic Senate candidate Michelle Nunn last year and leaked online on Monday reveals far more than just the inner workings of one high-profile Senate campaign. Details in the memo illuminate the dominant role of fundraising in the political world.""Hitting our targets will require us to prioritize fundraising above all else and to focus the candidate’s time on it with relentless intensity,"" the memo, written in December 2013 and leaked to National Review, states in a section on the campaign's finance plan.To reach the campaign's target of raising $15 million to $20 million for the entire race, the memo urges that Nunn's time be budgeted almost exclusively for fundraising, at least until the tail end of the race. Nunn, who would face no serious competition in the Democratic primary, should spend between 70 and 80 percent of her time raising money from January through September, according to the memo. Only in October does the recommended fundraising time drop to 50 percent.The memo estimates that there are 2,500 campaign hours in 2014 and recommends that 2,201 of them be spent raising money.The Nunn campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.While the memo was merely offering suggestions -- it notes that Nunn did not meet the recommended hours for fundraising in 2013 -- the enormous amount of time involved demonstrates how the chase for money has consumed the modern political campaign. And not without consequences.Decades of reporting and analysis of campaign fundraising show that political parties and candidates in both parties tend to tailor their policy priorities to the desires of specific donor communities. The Nunn fundraising plan does not shy away from doing just that. The memo identifies eight different groups as top potential sources of money for the Nunn campaign: women; Georgia CEOs and business leaders; the National Finance Committee, a group of big-money Democratic donors; young professionals; the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community; the Jewish community; trial lawyers and law firms; and the tech industry.The largest possible source of campaign funds is the business community, both in Georgia and nationally. According to the memo, Nunn, who now faces Republican businessman David Perdue in the general election, should appeal to corporate CEOs by adopting their policy priorities and talking points. This includes lowering the corporate tax rate and focusing on creating a ""well-trained work force"" -- the latter being a nod toward the alleged ""skills gap,"" which CEOs have widely blamed for their lack of hiring in the post-recession years.One major name in this category is General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt, who had ""offered to host an event"" for Nunn. Immelt is a major advocate of lowering the corporate tax rate. At the same time, his company paid an average federal income tax rate of 1.8 percent from 2002 through 2011 as it parked profits in offshore accounts, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.In addition to the suggestion that Nunn adopt corporate America's priorities, the memo lists as advisers on issues like tax reform and the budget various deficit hawk groups funded by private equity billionaire Pete Peterson, which support slashing Social Security and Medicare. These groups include the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, Fix the Debt and the Concord Coalition. Fix the Debt was a lobbying effort funded by the nation's largest corporations, including General Electric, to take advantage of the ""fiscal cliff"" deadline at the end of 2012 and reduce the government's debt load by cutting social safety net programs.Appeals to the interests of individuals and communities are, of course, the purpose of political campaigns, but critics of the role of money in politics point out that these appeals largely target the already wealthy, whose interests often diverge from those of the poor and middle class. That dynamic is evident in the Nunn memo. ""Our primary focus with call time will be making major requests, 1) asking individuals to raise $10,000 or more either through an event or just as a raiser, and 2) asking donors who have maxed to contribute to the Nunn Victory Fund,"" it says, looking to people who can afford to make large donations themselves and know others who can.The memo recommends that Nunn's time be focused on contacting only those donors who have given $1,000, but could give more; those who have already given the $5,200 maximum, but could give more to the victory fund, which redistributes money to the Georgia Democratic Party; and large donor candidates for the National Finance Committee.Suggested messaging to other communities similarly emphasizes their policy priorities, including Nunn's stance in favor of marriage equality for LGBT donors and reducing student loan debt for young professionals. Among Jewish donors, the memo suggests, ""Michelle's position on Israel will largely determine the level of support here.""Not all donor groups would get such direct messaging. The memo offers buzzwords and campaign pablum for others: A pitch to tech community donors should explain Nunn's belief in ""the entrepreneurial spirit of Georgians"" and how she ""knows what it's like to do a startup.""The strategy memo also reveals some surprising details about how the campaign planned to spend money raising money.After its major money source of fundraisers and large donors, the campaign saw its secondary money pot as online donors, whom it hoped to mine for $3 million. In the past 10 years, Democratic campaigns have become incredibly adept at raising small and medium-size donations from the party base over the Internet. The strategy outlined in the Nunn memo builds on this experience by looking to create a database of supporters through engaging potential donors on the issues, sponsoring online petitions and renting large lists, like that owned by the 2008 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.According to the memo, however, the campaign was not planning to budget any time or money toward direct mail fundraising. It is explained that Nunn did not want to engage in the kind of ""red meat"" contrasting of candidates that is needed to ""generate an emotional response that results in mailing a check.""""Experience to date indicates that ... the candidate is not comfortable with this practice and therefore, the campaign should probably not spend the money,"" the memo states.Beyond raising money for her own campaign, the memo indicates that Nunn was expected to raise at least $1 million for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to bring its resources into the race and $3 million for the Nunn Victory Fund to help fund the Georgia Democratic Party's get-out-the-vote efforts in November.The strategy outlined in the memo appears to be working -- at least when it comes to money. The Nunn campaign had raised $9.2 million by the end of June, only slightly less than the memo's goal of $9.5 million.See the campaign's fundraising targets below:"

He's the smug brat we always hated in high school. The one who acts like he's got all the answers but doesn't. The one begging for a smackdown.No wonder so many of us are salivating at rumors that NBC may relieve the grey-haired wonder boy from his Meet the Press duties. Much has been written on the downfall of Gregory. The sagging ratings (only outdone by those of MSNBC). The reports that NBC News had hired a ""psychological consultant"" to search for Gregory's (allegedly missing) human heartbeat. And now the rumors that Gregory is soon to be a goner. Yadda yadda yadda. I get it. We hate David Gregory. America hates David Gregory. But how quickly we forget.Back in 2005, when I was an MSNBC anchor and NBC News correspondent, David Gregory was loved -- by America and the media. The golden boy of NBC News. No one could boogy on the Plaza, grill the vice president, and cook a fajita quite like Gregory. Few at 30 Rock doubted Gregory would eventually succeed Matt Lauer as anchor of the TODAY show.Then destiny took over. On June 13, 2008, Tim Russert died of a heart attack. The nation grieved. NBC News scrambled. And by December, Gregory had taken over the helm of Meet the Press. Gone were the days of Dancin' Dave and the dead-on impressions of Tom Brokaw. Serious David Gregory had landed. And ""Serious David"" had big -- no, huge -- shoes to fill. Gregory wasn't just competing with Russert. He was competing with Russert's ghost.Not only was Russert admired on both sides of the political aisle, but he was so damn likable. He was the everyday man. A devoted son, as millions know from his best-selling book, Big Russ and Me. A football fan (""Go Bills!"" was his weekly send-off). And he had one heck of an Irish smile, to boot.No ""Serious David"" is everything Russert wasn't. Overly self-confident. An extrovert. Some would say smug. His detractors would surely note he seems to be a (proud) card-carrying liberal, judging from his questioning of Republican lawmakers. But we may have David Gregory all wrong.I met him when I was filling in as the weekend White House Correspondent for NBC News back in 2005. At the time, he was the NBC News Chief White House correspondent. I didn't get to know him well. But I do remember this.Not only was he approachable. He was helpful. I had no contacts at the White House and he went out of his way to share his. He gave me advice on how to navigate Washington and NBC News. He seemed like he genuinely wanted newbies like me to succeed. And from our conversations, I couldn't judge his political leanings. He was confusing.And Gregory seemed likable. Yes, a normal guy (if you don't count his extraordinary height). Your average then-36 year old guy from California. (Don't let the grey hair fool you, he's young.) A typical dad, who would whip out photos of his three kids without being asked.And that's my point. Maybe if the Real Gregory came out more -- the one I met-- we'd actually like him. At least, enough to share a cup of coffee with on Sundays.I'm guessing he hasn't had a chance to show us the Real Gregory because he's like a lot of us. Insecure. In over our heads. Under enormous pressure from his bosses to succeed. Combine all of it and it's not exactly the ideal atmosphere to relax and be yourself.And another thing. The next time you read a DOA report on David Gregory, remember this: America's media seems to thrive on those stories. After all, it has a strange habit of devouring its own -- glorifying network anchors and then savoring their downfall. Just ask Katie Couric and Matt Lauer. They'll tell you. Nothing seems to entertain the American media more than watching our media stars fall. And that's a lesson David Gregory may learn all too well... too soon."

Argentina commemorates the 60th anniversary of the death of Argentina's most famous first lady on Thursday, July 26, 2012. Evita died of cancer on July 26, 1952 at the age of 33. (AP Photo/Eduardo Di Baia, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13b2e240000320076e41a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BUENOS AIRES -- And on the 116th minute, Mario Götze silenced the Maracaná, burying the hopes of thousands of Argentines in the stadium and giving Germany the World Cup. It was soon followed by Brazilian laughter, German celebrations, and booing against FIFA, an organization that did everything to deserve it. Then, the palpable disappointment of an Argentine team that gave it all in the World Cup. Yet there was nothing more heartbreaking -- even more than that late goal -- than ""impossible"" Lionel Messi's face when receiving the Ballon D'Or. On Brazilian soil, Argentines once again learned to lose, just as the Germany of Joachim Löw did for a decade. But the honorable behavior of the team on the pitch and outside it could not but contrast with the political response in Buenos Aires over the last 10 days. Such contrast makes one wish that the government in Buenos Aires learned to lose -- and only then begin preparing for future successes. In the Argentina of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, however, the government holds on to defeat as a symbol of an ideology that is vacuous and lost. The very night of the World Cup final defeat, the streets of Buenos Aires were filled by proud supporters. Yet the celebrations soon turned sour, with attacks against local businesses and means of transport. The police reacted late and ineptly. The minister of security, meanwhile, only found the time to decry ""destabilizing factions"" rather than to take responsibility for a sense of insecurity that has become the city's key problem. Hours later, I was ashamed to witness in person how the only Aerolineas Argentinas -- the airline President Kirchner nationalized in 2008 -- flight that returned to Buenos Aires on time was that which carried its CEO Mariano Recalde and his friends of ""La Campora,"" the ultra-Kirchnerite organization. The rest of the flights shared the same usual fate of Aerolineas: up to eight hours late and without any representatives to face client concerns. Maybe that is why Recalde moved swiftly and stealthily through the Rio de Janeiro airport. It appears that the ""national and popular"" ideology that he loves to talk about with regards to the ""national airline"" makes it impossible for him to provide transparency on the firm's accounts or its public subsidies, not to mention the endless reports of overcharges and illegal campaign contributions. Back in Buenos Aires, the Argentine football team had to put up with a televised welcome from President Kirchner, who sought to obtain political favor from their gargantuan efforts even though she admitted she had skipped each and every game. At the local football association, an organization co-opted by political power and damaged by illegal ticket resale allegations, Kirchner presented the players with a backdrop from Football for All (Futbol Para Todos). Futbol Para Todos is the expensive program that nationalized football TV rights in 2009. Since then, and including the World Cup, in order to enjoy the finest sport on Earth one has to put up with the type of political propaganda that would make Politburo types shiver. Subtlety is not their thing. And yet, nobody in the government can provide clear accounts of how much the taxpayer spends on FFA, an embarrassment in a country with child malnutrition. A few hours after the televised ""presentation,"" Kirchner travelled to the BRICS Summit in Brazil, where all Latin American presidents were invited. Upon leaving the territory, Vice President Amado Boudou -- a man formally charged for bribery and businesses unbecoming of his office -- became acting president. Boudou is implicated in a case involving the spurious takeover of Ciccone, the private company tasked with printing local currency bills. In a country suffering from stagflation, one can be sure inflation will continue when the crooked politicians take over the printers. Every single corruption allegation against the government somehow touches upon Boudou. And yet, the veep refused to step down, even when cabinet members refuse to be seen with him. Politics aside, the Argentine economy is in free fall, stuck with negative growth, rampant and accelerating inflation, and poverty indexes that grow together with unemployment. The ""high growth, high inflation mix"" that Kirchner sold so successfully in the last decade is now exhausted, and only the neo-Marxist finance minister (Dr. Kicillof) does not acknowledge the existence of stagflation. And now, courtesy of a battle against debt holdouts that Argentina ignored for a decade, it may even be possible for the country to return to default -- the end product of the 2001 crisis that eventually brought the Kirchners to power in 2003 -- this very week. A technical default would only deepen Argentina's isolation from world markets, dooming it to sit on the third largest proven reserves of shale but without resources to develop them. From its security policy to suspicious, crony nationalizations, and down to its corrupt officials still in office, the Argentine president refuses to learn when she has lost. Without admitting defeat, ideology is left naked to face undeniable reality. Today this ideology is only useful to protect the corrupt and hide scandals. Power is never eternal, and for Kirchner it is finally running out. So that a new Argentina can be built, we must learn when we lost -- learning and building from bad experiences into future successes. Before Messi and his team can get revenge for the World Cup final in Russia come 2018, Argentines will face the polls in October next year. Let us learn to lose, so that then we can think about winning."

He is sedated and under guard.Plotts, 49, was at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital for an appointment earlier Thursday when he began ranting about its gun ban and then drew a gun from his waistband and shot his caseworker, 53-year-old Theresa Hunt, psychiatrist Lee Silverman told police.Silverman crouched behind a chair, pulled out his own weapon and fired back, striking Plotts several times, authorities said.Plotts had 39 unspent bullets on him when he was wrestled to the ground, police said. Two guns were also found at the scene, including a revolver that police say Plotts used to kill Hunt.""If the doctor did not have a firearm, (and) the doctor did not utilize the firearm, he'd be dead today, and I believe that other people in that facility would also be dead,"" Whelan said.Police in Upper Darby, where Plotts once lived, were aware of at least three mental health commitments, including once after he cut his wrists and once when he threatened suicide. Whelan said Plotts had spent time in a mental health facility, but he did not discuss any potential diagnosis.Plotts's record also includes past assault, drug and gun charges, including one of possessing a weapon when banned from doing so, according to police and court records. And he has been barred from at least one residential shelter because of his violent history, Upper Darby police Superintendent Michael Chitwood said.""The caseworkers and the doctors and the catchment centers — they know who violent individuals are because they're frequent fliers,"" Chitwood said.

His wife said Friday he was resting at home and did not want to comment.Cathy Nickel, a neighbor of Plotts when he lived at an apartment complex in Upper Darby, saw a caseworker move him out of the building about a year ago. As he was taken away, she said, he yelled, ""You haven't heard the end of me!""Plotts doesn't have a listed home number, and it was unclear if he has relatives in the area.Hospital policy bars anyone except on-duty law enforcement officers from carrying weapons on campus, said a Mercy Health System spokeswoman.

AFP PHOTO / LIONEL BONAVENTURE (Photo credit should read LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ec752200004301dd3172.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) When he was a student at Brigham Young University three years ago, Anthony Willey came across a Wikipedia page on Mormons. What he read filled him with frustration.The article focused on polygamy, which seemed odd since Mormons officially outlawed the practice in 1890. “It didn’t say what Mormons believe or what made them unique,” Willey said. “I had the thought, ‘Who’s editing this stuff?’ and that got me hooked.”Since editing that page and adding 50 percent to the content, Willey has made more than 8,000 edits to the editable online encyclopedia, mostly on articles related to Mormonism. His top edited pages include entries on Joseph Smith, Mormons, Mormonism, and Black people and Mormonism.The problem confronting many Wikipedia editors is that religion elicits passion — and often, more than a little vitriol as believers and critics spar over facts, sources and context. For “Wikipedians” like Willey, trying to put a lid on the online hate speech that can be endemic to Wikipedia entries is a key part of their job.Religion is among several of the top 100 altered topics on Wikipedia, according to a recent list published by Five Thirty Eight. Former President George W. Bush is the most contested entry, but Jesus (No. 5) and the Catholic Church (No. 7) fall closely behind.Islam’s Prophet Muhammad (No. 35) and Pope John Paul II (No. 82) are included, as well as all manner of religions, like Jehovah’s Witnesses, Islam, Christianity and Scientology. And countries and topics with religious sensitivities are also controversial, including global warming and Israel.Wikipedia is the fifth most-trafficked website on the Internet and its complex policies and regulations for editing — more than 50 of them — for editing the open-source site total nearly 150,000 words (thick enough for a book). Any registered user can create an entry on Wikipedia, a collaboratively edited encyclopedia. Volunteers write Wikipedia’s 30 million articles in 287 languages.Willey, 29, is now a Wikipedia administrator, which gives him more administrative privileges within the volunteer-driven website. The physics graduate is looking for full-time work, so his editing is only an occasional side project. And it’s only partly driven by his faith.“I don’t edit as an agent of my religion,” Willey said. “I’m not going out of my way to promote a certain point of view. I am motivated by when people say things that aren’t true.”It could be tempting for Wikipedia editors to portray their own faiths in the best light, or for people outside of the faith to paint a negative picture. In 2009, Wikipedia banned people using the Church of Scientology’s computers and some of Scientology’s critics from changing Wikipedia articles about Scientology. Wikipedia said members of the church and some critics engaged in “edit wars” by adding or removing complimentary or disparaging material.“The worst casualties have been biographies of living people, where attempts have been repeatedly made to slant the article either towards or against the subject, depending on the point of view of the contributing editor,” a committee wrote in its decision to ban users.Some users might go out of their way to portray a religion in a bad light. Several years ago, a user who went by the name Duke53 attempted to ensure Mormonism’s sacred undergarments got as much exposure as possible — it’s not a topic the church generally likes to discuss. He added images to as many articles as possible, including to Wikipedia articles such as “Clothing” and “Church etiquette,” regardless of whether the images were relevant.When Willey edits an article, he says, he avoids inserting opinions and instead uses a trusted source, such as Richard Bushman, a respected emeritus historian at Columbia University.“Even if I don’t agree with something in his book, for the purposes of editing Wikipedia, it keeps me honest,” Willey said. “It makes it very hard for people to argue with me because when it comes to editing something on Wikipedia, it all comes down to who has the best source. If I’m promoting the view of the best source, I’m always right.”He will occasionally edit pages on other religions, such as Islam or Baha’i, or general articles on Christianity. “Nobody likes to be misrepresented,” he said.Those who engage in outright hate speech are dealt with swiftly and blocked, but combating more subtle hate speech can be tricky.“If somebody’s abiding by the rules, it’s hard to block a contributor who’s writing an article if they’re ambiguously promoting something,” Willey said.Roger Nicholson was on the same path as Willey, editing Wikipedia pages related to Mormonism for two years to experience what the editing was like. His story, featured in the Deseret News, ended after he decided all the “edit wars” weren’t worth the headaches.“It’s kind of like the Wild West of the Internet,” said Nicholson, who works with a group called FairMormon instead. “You could spend days and accomplish the change of a few sentences and that was it.”Among the Wikipedians, a large percentage self-identify as atheists, followed by Christians, Muslims, Pastafarians (devotees of the farcical religion of the Flying Spaghetti Monster) and Jews.Most of the edits to Wikipedia articles, especially ones on religion, are made by men, according to a 2011 study by the University of Minnesota. Women accounted for just 7 percent of the edits on religion articles.John Carter, a 51-year-old office worker in St. Louis who is Catholic, will sometimes help edit more controversial pages, including ones on Scientology, Martin Luther and Wikipedia’s list of new religious movements.Many of the smaller religious groups have editors who are deeply passionate about them, but some smaller religions that aren’t as appealing to Westerners (including Native American or Central Asian American traditions) are covered less well, Carter said.“An enemy (or friend) of a ‘cult’ in Ecuador could find sources supporting their personal positions and the obscurity of the topic in English will make it hard or impossible for most of us to confirm or deny,” Carter said.Carter, Willey and other editors discussed editing religion pages in a Q-and-A with Wikipedia last year where an editor with the user ID Sowlos said there was quite a bit of overlap between religion and mythology on the website.“If a mythology is a sacred narrative or collection of traditional stories, then all religions include mythologies as integral constituents of what they are,” Sowlos wrote. “However, many people feel uneasy referring to stories from their respective religions as ‘mythology’ for fear that it will be interpreted as indicating a lack of factual integrity.”Using Wikipedia’s rules, Carter says, religion can be difficult to independently verify, especially when there’s a range of opinions about what events took place and what they mean.“No one has any real evidence that Jesus rose from the dead or not — how do you give the various opinions balanced coverage? And was he God, or a god, or something else?” Carter said. “Even nominal Christians disagree on those and several other significant topics.”"

It is about atonement — atonement for the 16 million killed in the conflict and the more than 20 million wounded, many of them horribly disfigured in trench warfare that kept much of the four-year conflict at a stalemate.“I was struggling with praying for the beginning of a war,” said the Rev. Gina Campbell, the cathedral’s canon precentor and the author of the World War I liturgy. “I was trying to put my mind around how one prays for the beginning of a war. I thought it would need to be profoundly penitential, that the way one would approach the disaster that is World War I would have to be in deep penitence.”The result is an entire service — music, litany and prayers — that acknowledge the horrors of war and the distance war takes people of faith from God. The service will be said this Sunday (July 27) at the Washington, D.C cathedral.“One hundred years ago, an assassin’s bullet plunges the nations of the world into violence unlike any the world has ever seen,” the service’s litany of prayer begins, before citing the number of dead and wounded, including civilians.“From the fields of Flanders to the forests of Verdun to the peninsula of Gallipoli, the dead cry out: life and love interrupted; hope and promise laid waste; war, war, and more war. Forgive us!”Campbell crafted the liturgy at the request of Congress’s World War I Centennial Commission, which is organizing memorial events around the country for the next four years. She was part of a committee that included Episcopal Bishop Jay Magness (who oversees military chaplains), retired Navy chaplain Wollum Jensen, the cathedral’s music director and others.They and the cathedral have made the liturgy available for other houses of worship to use or adapt and posted them online. Campbell worked to make the service interfaith, relying heavily on the Old Testament for readings and leaving out the name of Jesus in most of the prayers.“I wanted to reach as many kinds of worshipping communities as possible because in World War I there were huge numbers of Muslims fighting, huge numbers of Jews,” she said. “This was not a Christian war, and the prayers should reflect that.”She also tried to make sure the service did more than mark a great conflict that realigned the global map.“I thought, ‘This can’t just be a commemoration, this has to speak to a contemporary situation as well,” she said. “Church is not just about remembering, it is about remembering forward. We have to bring it into the present and into God’s hope for our future.”Houses of worship in other countries will mark the war’s outbreak with special services, too. The Conference of European Churches and the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe have created resources for their congregations.The Church of England, which will mark the anniversary of Great Britain’s entry into the war on Aug. 4, 1914, has also crafted a special liturgy that resonates with images and sounds of the war.“For all the boots of the tramping warriors and all the garments rolled in blood shall be burned as fuel for the fire,” the service’s Old Testament Canticle begins. “For a child has been born for us, a son given to us, and the government will be on his shoulders.”Bishop Stephen Platten, the creator of the Church of England’s World War I resources, said the church has a special role to play in commemorating the war.“In the First World War it was the Church of England (that was) the holder, if you like, of the national conscience at that point,” Platten said in an interview with the BBC. “In the Falklands conflict it was true, it was true in the Gulf War and it continues to be true in Afghanistan.”"

The role of Cobain has yet to be cast.“CAA (Creative Artists Agency) directly sent me actors’ (demo) reels,” Love told Philippine Daily Inquirer. “That was really tough because these boys are so pretty, so cute. I won’t name names because I don’t want to jinx it for anyone but these are 25-year-olds who are blond, gorgeous and the new Brad Pitts. There’s a ton of those. Some are really good actors, not just pretty faces. I don’t want to be the person who makes that decision. Let’s leave that to the agents; I have great agents now. But I will have a say in it.”In the past, actors like Ryan Gosling, Robert Pattinson, Ewan McGregor and Jared Leto have been mentioned as possible onscreen incarnations of Cobain. Love has also discussed a documentary about Cobain, which is attached to Brett Morgen, famous for ""The Kid Stays in the Picture,"" as well as the possibility of a Cobain-inspired musical. "

""The need to speak out became clear. With the support of our publisher, Arthur Sulzberger, the editorial writers mapped out the series we started today. A team of web editors and designers created a special design for the Times website, as well as charts and graphs, videos and interactive features.""In an email to Politico's Mike Allen, Rosenthal said that most of the conversations that took place centered around ""whether it was time for the Times (meaning the editorial page) to make this kind of statement and how to do it.""In a departure from normal practice, many of the editorials in the series are signed by individual editorial board members. In the press release, Rosenthal wrote that this was intended to bring a ""more personal approach"" to this highly personal issue. ""We will continue to experiment in the future on different ways to use the power of the unsigned editorial, along with new and different ways to signal the author of other editorial articles,"" he added.The experimentation comes as part of a wave of efforts by the Times to refurbish its op-ed offerings for the digital age.

Dempsey, publicly expressed concern over the chain of events Russian President Vladimir Putin was unleashing in Eastern Europe “that many not stay in Eastern Europe.”“If I have a fear about this,” General Dempsey told the Aspen Security Forum over the weekend, “it’s that Putin may actually light a fire that he loses control of.”The Russians “are on a path to assert themselves differently,” Dempsey said, “not just in Eastern Europe, but in Europe in the main and toward the United States.”Already, he noted, Russia’s violations of Ukraine’s sovereignty have triggered a rise in nationalism around Europe.Referring to Stalin’s invasion of eastern Poland in September, 1939, Dempsey continued, “You’ve got a Russian government that has made the conscious decision to use its military force inside of another sovereign nation to achieve its objectives -- first time, I think, probably, since 1939 or so that that’s been the case.”PUTIN’S VISIONGeneral Dempsey offered his view of what was driving Putin’s actions: “I think this is very clearly [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, the man himself, with a vision for Europe, as he sees it, to what he considers to be an effort to redress grievances that were burdened upon Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union, and also to appeal to ethnic Russian enclaves across Eastern Europe with ... a foreign policy objective, but also a domestic policy objective. And he’s very aggressive about it, and he’s got a playbook that has worked for him now two or three times. And he will continue to [use it].”In a startlingly candid remark, Dempsey surmised that Putin’s own military was not entirely on board. “I think that the Russian military is probably reluctant -- -- you know, this is risky for me to say this, and 10 of them could end up in a gulag tomorrow -- but I think that the Russian military and its leaders that I know are probably somewhat reluctant participants in this form of warfare,” he said.Going forward, Dempsey said that NATO will have to revive its mission of maintaining stability in Europe, this time to counter Putin’s Russia instead of the Soviet Union.In the meantime, America’s top commander said “I am maintaining an open line of communication with my counterpart, and so far, he’s doing the same with me.”The Army General also said that an “active process” is underway to determine what help the US could provide Ukraine. The New York Times reported Sunday that US intelligence was considering providing real-time targeting data to Ukrainian forces on the location of Russian and pro-Russian separatist missiles and artillery."
