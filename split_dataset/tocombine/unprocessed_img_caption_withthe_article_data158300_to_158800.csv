0,WELLNESS,5 Signs You're an Emotional Eater and What to Do About It,"Sarah Jenks, Contributor
Founder of Live More Weigh Less",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emotional-eating_us_5b9d009ce4b03a1dcc83aba0,"So many of us have been taught that we need to ""weigh less in order to live more,"" but I really believe we have to live more in order to weigh less. We have to stop waiting on the weight and start having fun -- only then will we finally stop being a slave to food and get out of body jail.",2013-04-09,Girl holding chocolate cupcake in hands wearing leopard print scarf and brown nail polish.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d009c2100005100c558db.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I started counting Weight Watcher points when I was 12 years old. By the fourth day, I was polishing off a sleeve of Thin Mints under my bed. I remembered the leader telling me it was all about willpower -- I guess I needed to work on that. Since I had failed at the points system, I gave other diets a try. Over the next decade I did South Beach, Atkins, gluten-free, the grapefruit diet, the Master Cleanse, Zone... the list goes on and on.Every diet was the same thing: The first two days went great, the third day I got really hangry (hungry + angry), and by the fourth day I'd be on the kitchen floor with a box of tissues and an empty pint of ice cream. What was my problem?One day, on the third day of my seven-day juice cleanse, I snuck into the supply closet of my NYC advertising agency and polished off an entire bag of Dove Chocolate Promises. Yes, the whole bag. Ashamed, nauseous and completely pissed off, it finally hit me: If this diet thing was gonna work, it would've happened by now.I considered, what if the problem isn't me? What if the problem is the diet? What I discovered soon after is that there are two types of people out there: one type who has an education problem, who really doesn't know what you need to eat to be healthy, and the other type is the person who knows what they should do but can't seem to make it happen.For the first type, traditional diets like Weight Watchers and South Beach are great because they provide a simple educational structure for learning and executing healthy eating. As for the second type, we could write a damn good diet book ourselves with our wealth of knowledge. The challenge doesn't lie in knowing what to eat and how much, it's in why we eat. Regardless of how badly we want to lose weight, or how clear the system is, because we have an emotional dependence on food, no matter how strict the rules are, we're gonna break them.In the years since my Dove chocolate incident, I've completely changed my relationship with food, upgraded my life and lost 30 pounds (no calorie counting or crazy workouts required). Now, as a coach and emotional eating expert, I've helped countless women all over the world create a life and body they love through my signature method, Live More, Weigh Less.What I want to help you with today is understanding if you're an emotional eater, so you're no longer wasting your time and money on traditional diets that are never going to work for you. I'm also gonna tell you what you can do to find peace with food and finally lose weight. Here are five signs you're an emotional eater. If this is you, dieting will probably be a complete waste of time:1. You eat when you're not hungry. Our hunger is our body's way of telling us we need physical nourishment. Now, when you want food and you don't have the growling, rumbling feeling in your tummy, it means you're craving emotional nourishment. For many of us food is the fastest, cheapest, simplest way to feel entertained, loved and comforted. I can't tell you how many times I ran to the candy bowl at 4 p.m. because I was bored, or went through an entire pint of ice cream because I was lonely. I was never actually hungry in those moments -- I just wanted to be filled.2. You have food FOMO. We've all heard the term ""FOMO,"" aka ""fear of missing out,"" but many of us equate it to seeing pics of our friends having fun without us on Facebook. Food FOMO is when we're watching a friend eat a cookie and wanting it to snatch it away and devour it, or when you're visiting your grandmother and shoveling her special meatloaf in your face because you're not gonna get it again for a year, or watching all of your friends have a third glass of wine and feeling the pressure to join in. We subconsciously believe that the magic, the happiness, the satisfaction is in the food, and we want our share.3. You and your body are not such good friends. Because most emotional eaters are eating more than they need to, and are overriding their bodies' natural signals (aka hunger) we tend to develop a bad relationship with our bodies. We pick ourselves apart in the mirror, call ourselves weak and careless for looking the way we do and convince ourselves that if we could just get our sh*t together then we'll finally start dating or have more confidence at work. If you find yourself in this trap, I'm gonna get you out by the end of this blog.4. You don't want other people to really know what you eat.  I remember secretly loving it when my boyfriend was working late because it meant I could eat whatever I wanted without feeling embarrassed. I had this idea that if he really saw how I ate then he wouldn't love me. When we hide our food it perpetuates our belief that there's something wrong with us and that if people really knew what was going on, then they'd think we're a freak or a weirdo. 5. You feel guilty for eating.  You know when you dive into a chocolate lava cake at a restaurant and every time you put a spoonful of chocolatey heaven in your mouth you're thinking, ""I shouldn't be eating this. I shouldn't be eating this. I shouldn't be eating this""? What a buzz kill! When we do this we're completely robbing ourselves of the eating experience, which leaves us craving more and more of the ""forbidden"" food to feel satisfied. Is this resonating with you? Before you go into this place of ""I'm more messed up than I thought!"" I need you to know that there's nothing wrong or broken about you. You just got some wires crossed and some bad training. We're gonna handle it. I've helped hundreds of women find freedom from emotional eating all over the world, and the thing that has helped me and all my clients the most is this very simple act: Have more fun. Yes, it's that simple.Here's why it works:1. Having more fun means we're more entertained, less bored and have a list of things to do when things get out of whack. Next time you want a cookie, get a 10-minute back massage. Next time you want to down a bag of chips, have a dance party.2. Having more fun makes us more attractive. A woman who's lit up, lights up a room, and everyone wants a piece. This creates more attraction and romance in a long term relationship and more suitors knocking on your door if you're single. Love is our deepest need, and if we're starving for it, we're always gonna fill the void with food.3. Having more fun forces us to put ourselves out there. I can't tell you how many women I know think that once they lose 20 pounds, that's when they'll start dating, ask for a raise or start having more adventure in their life. They end up sitting at home doing nothing and trying not to eat. All that boredom of course sends our cravings into overdrive. We have to start living our lives now, not 20 pounds from now. The fulfillment and meaning that comes from taking charge of our lives gives us the spark we've been searching for in our late night binges. So many of us have been taught that we need to ""weigh less in order to live more,"" but I really believe we have to live more in order to weigh less. We have to stop waiting on the weight and start having fun -- only then will we finally stop being a slave to food and get out of body jail. In the comments below I really want to know:1. What is the biggest thing you struggle with when it comes to emotional eating? 2. What at the three things you're gonna start doing for fun?If you want even more ideas on how to make your life a frickin' blast and end your struggle with emotional eating, check out LiveMoreWeighLess.com.

1,WELLNESS,The Many Benefits of Mindfulness,"Lisa Firestone, Contributor
Psychology expert on relationships, parenting, self-destructiv...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mindfulness-benefits_us_5b9cfa67e4b03a1dcc8375e5,"If asked to explain the value of mindfulness, you may want to consider the following question: Can you sit for one minute and completely quiet your mind?  Can you do this without feeling like you're coming out of your skin?",2013-04-08,Lady sitting by sea edge in the evening looking at the sea.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfa671f00005000216f7f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If asked to explain the value of mindfulness, you may want to consider the following question: Can you sit for one minute and completely quiet your mind? Can you do this without feeling like you're coming out of your skin? When Dr. Donna Rockwell first became interested in mindfulness, she discovered that this exercise proved quite a challenge. She found, like so many of us would, if we really took the time to try it out, meditating, or even just calming our mind, can be tough to do. It's no wonder that in an age of high-speed this and digitized that, it's even harder to slow down, to connect with ourselves, and to just be.In February, I was fortunate to meet up with Dr. Donna Rockwell at the Society for Humanistic Psychology Conference in Santa Barbara, Calif. In addition to being a clinical psychologist, a writer, and an international speaker, Donna is now a teacher of mindfulness meditation. On April 18, she and I will be presenting an online webinar, ""Mindfulness in Everyday Life: The Way to Happiness and Meaning."" When I had the chance to interview Donna on this subject, she described the state that most people pass their time in, in which they are either ""bemoaning the past or catastrophizing the future."" In other words, we spend very little time in the present.Mindfulness expert Jon Kabat-Zinn has described mindfulness as paying attention to the present moment with intention, while letting go of judgment, as if our life depends on it. The present is the only real moment we have. And, in fact, our life may actually depend on it. Among its many benefits, mindfulness meditation may actually increase telomerase, the ""caps"" at the end of our genes, which, in turn, can reduce cell damage and lengthen our lives. In addition, research demonstrates that mindfulness may help bolster our immune system, making us better able to fight off diseases from the flu to cancer. Mindfulness helps improve our concentration and reduce ruminative thinking that contributes to the high levels of stress that is so prevalent in our society. Stress and ruminative thinking can be taxing on both our physical and mental health. So how can mindfulness help to enhance our well-being?Mindfulness is an incredible tool to help people understand, tolerate, and deal with their emotions in healthy ways. It helps us to alter our habitual responses by taking pause and choosing how we act. When we are mindful, we experience our life as we live it. We experience the world directly through our five senses. We taste the food we are eating. We recognize the thoughts we are having. In doing so, we learn how our minds work, and we are better able to label the thoughts and feelings we are having, instead of allowing them to overpower us and dictate our behavior. Because mindfulness presents an effective method to get to know oneself, to reduce stress, and to live in the present moment, cultivating mindfulness is a powerful therapeutic practice. Mindfulness can potentially help individuals who have bipolar disorder who are suffering from suicidal ideation. Mark Williams has written extensively on how mindfulness may lessen the likelihood of recurring depression. Having shown such positive results, mindfulness techniques and meditation have been incorporated by many therapists into their methods.When we learn mindfulness techniques, we help to train our minds to observe its own thoughts, feelings, and sensations with an objective view. This must be done with compassion, as we tend to lose patience with ourselves, particularly in the early stages of practicing mindfulness or trying out meditation. When we release judgment and learn to live in the moment, we increase our mental agility. We can also better regulate our emotions. As Williams wrote in his book The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness, ""Get out of our heads and learn to experience the world directly, experientially, without the relentless commentary of our thoughts. We might just open ourselves up to the limitless possibilities for happiness that life has to offer us.""As human beings, we are often surprised to find that we can tolerate much more than we imagine. People who have anger problems fall victim to their emotional reactions when certain triggers set them off. By learning mindfulness, they are far better able to take pause and react in a more constructive way to conflict. A simple breathing exercise can interrupt their outburst and lead to a more favorable outcome. This is also true for parents who are struggling with their children and couples who are keying off each other based on destructive dynamics that have built up between them.When we are reactive, falling victim to our immediate thoughts or emotions, we are not always acting in our own self-interest. Mindfulness provides a great tool for developing more self-acceptance, which helps us build our compassion for others. It allows us to take more power and be more strategic in terms of our goals. It can bring us closer to the people we care about and help us to interrupt self-sabotaging patterns we've adopted throughout our lives.Teaching ourselves to calm down and to be more receptive than reactive is a practice made possible through mindfulness techniques. Whether learning to meditate or merely to tune in with ourselves at various times throughout our day, we are enhancing our ability to feel more integrated and to act with integrity. We improve our ability to focus our attention. We are better able to slow the racing thoughts that lead us to engage in limiting or self-sabotaging behaviors. We strengthen our resilience and enhance our capacity to experience the joys of everyday life. Cultivating mindfulness is perhaps the greatest gift we can give ourselves. In a sense, it is a gift of time, the permission to slow down and be present, to experience life as we live it and to discover who we really are in the process.Read more from Lisa Firestone at PsychAlive.org.Learn more about the April 18 CE Webinar ""Mindfulness in Everyday Life: The Way to Happiness and Meaning.""For more by Lisa Firestone, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

Gov. Gavin Newsom, after arriving at San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco, Thursday, Feb. 16, 2012. President Obama is spending the night in San Francisco attending a number of private fundraising events. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d028d2000004e00fdccd7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Beauty is a beast that can burden those who have it and torture those who feel they've drawn the short straw. Even the president is not immune to a lovely lady. He said this about Kamala Harris, Attorney General of California: ""You have to be careful to, first of all, say she is brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough, and she is exactly what you'd want in anybody who is administering the law and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake,"" Obama said. ""She also happens to be by far the best-looking attorney general in the country.""Had he been truly careful, he might have quit while he was ahead before tangling with the beast that is beauty. A gaffe it may have been, but it speaks to an ongoing conversation. How, how, how do women win the war on looks when our own commander-in-chief just can't stop himself in choosing to highlight them as well? However well-meaning they might have been, comment like this do not help, especially from a leader of a supposed ""free world.""But how free are any of us really when the follow-up to a roster of great attributes ends with a comment about looks?Obama has his own girls. No doubt he thinks they are beautiful, but what makes them beautiful is the real question.My communications degree taught me a lot about beauty, our perceptions of it and how much more likely people are to be successful depending on how ""beautiful"" someone is perceived. It's impossible not to notice what people look like, but the mark of my maturity as an adult has been in reaching far beyond the physical to what is underneath... the spirit, the drive, the pulse of what makes someone tick.As a parent, I am painfully aware of how I describe and craft my observations of people. I am also very careful in how I tell my children how I see them. I've struggled with the word ""beautiful"" in describing my own daughter, not because I don't think she is, but because of how are society seems to value physical beauty above other qualities. And now that she is older, we discuss beauty as a living thing -- beauty in a kind gesture, a bright smile, a gentle touch, self-confidence created by working hard, failing and succeeding, studying, reading, striving, pushing. When my daughter hears me say she is beautiful, she understands that I am commenting on something much deeper than a set of physical attributes.Women everywhere work with what we are given to feel good about themselves, and it should be no secret that self-confidence has way more to do with real beauty than any physical gifts. Our life experiences and intellect combined with education cultivated over time deepens and sharpens that self-confidence. No one in a position such as Kamala Harris gets there without any of those things. While her physical beauty is part of who she is, that Obama felt compelled to name it within the context of his speech is what bothers me. Because I want more for myself and my daughter than to be chasing the whimsical tail of perceived good looks, I want more from my president whose own girls are watching and listening. I want my president to keep those things to himself and most importantly, focus on the picture that really matters...one in which a brilliant, hard-working, self-confident woman so stunning in her achievements, manner and character that any observation of physical attributes is simply not worth mentioning.It is only then that all of us, men and women, will really be free from the beast that is physical beauty."

His Holiness has met The Queen in Scotland as well as political and religious representatives.

Thatcher, who governed Britain for 11 years from 1979 to 1990, ""died peacefully following a stroke this morning,"" her spokesman, Lord Bell, told The Telegraph. Her death was confirmed by her son and daughter. This was not Thatcher's first stroke -- The Telegraph reported that she had suffered several strokes between 2001 and 2002. Her health woes also included dementia, with which she was diagnosed in 2008. CNN reported that she had to be hospitalized in December of last year because of a growth that had developed in her bladder. A stroke is generally defined as deprivation of blood to the brain. This leads to a lack of oxygen and nutrients to the brain, causing cell death, according to the Mayo Clinic. There are different kinds of stroke, but the most common -- making up 85 percent of strokes -- are ischemic strokes, which are caused by narrowing/blockages of the arteries that go to the brain, the Mayo Clinic reported. Other kinds of stroke include hemorrhagic stroke -- which is when the blood vessels leak or rupture -- and transient ischemic attack, also known as a mini-stroke -- which has similar symptoms to a stroke, but doesn't cause lasting symptoms (and is often considered a warning sign for an actual stroke). Thatcher's exact type of stroke was not specified in news reports. It's not uncommon to have more than one stroke. One in four people who have a stroke will have another one sometime in their lifetime, and anywhere from 5 to 14 percent of people who have a first stroke will also have a second stroke within the next year, according to the National Stroke Association. And 24 percent of women and 42 percent of men will have a recurrent stroke within five years after a first stroke. Even though there was no specific confirmation that Thatcher's strokes were related to her dementia, research has shown that about 30 percent of people who have experienced recurrent stroke do go on to develop dementia, Medscape Today reported. Age is a huge risk factor for stroke, as is family history, race, migraine history, heart attack history, sex (men have a higher risk) and having conditions including sickle cell anemia, the University of Maryland Medical Center reported. Modifiable risk factors include smoking, being obese, not exercising, stress and high alcohol intake. Stroke symptoms aren't the same for every person, but usually involve experiencing weakness or numbness on one side of the body, having trouble talking or understanding speech, vision problems, headaches and dizziness, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.

Um... let's face it, there is no competing with that.1. Do not wrap yourself in a blue Snuggie and take to your bed with a box of Captain Crunch, watching infinite hours of ""Two and a Half Men."" This serves no good purpose and those smashed Crunch Berries are itchy and apparantly attract bed bugs.2. Do not set his Ferragamo shoes and Rolexes on the front lawn with a sign that says ""FREE!"" It is very embarrassing to have to go collect all these items from your neighbors when you get the cease and desist order from his attorney.3. Under no circumstances drink a bottle of Cabernet at your married friend's house, back up into her tree, and then drunk text your ex ending every sentence with ""mother fucker.""Here is what I recommend for dealing with the departure of a husband:1. Get an attorney ASAP, but do your research. I picked my first attorney because she had the same name as the head cheer leader in high school that I idolized. One year and $25,000 later, I was no closer to being divorced then I was the first day I retained her. However, she did treat me to an endless pasta bowl at the Olive Garden once. Moral of the story, get referrals, get advice and talk to each potential attorney. Read up on the divorce laws of your state, know your rights and protect yourself!2. Seek out support. Your married friends love you and feel your pain, but hello -- they're still married! Look for divorce support groups in your area, but beware of what I call the ""Sad Sacks Divorcees."" I went to one meet-up where everyone sat around at a table in a sports bar crying and reliving their stories. This will be enough to put you back in your Snuggie with a fresh box of Crunch Berries. If it's not a good fit, move on! I also did a few online groups, including a first wives social network. There you can vent, cry, act out, and read informative articles and no one can see your face.3. Most importantly, take care of you. One thing I realized once I found myself alone is that I didn't even know me anymore. What were my dreams, desires, new goals? Take the time to figure it out. Believe me, I know how hard it is. I was married for 27 years to a man I met in 11th grade. I regret a lot of the things I did during our break-up, including horrible text messaging and acting out in front of my children. Above all, try and retain your dignity. This will pass and you will survive, whether you believe it now or not. Be able to continue onto a new life with your head held high. I can tell you from experience, a new world awaits you, and in time you will embrace it."
