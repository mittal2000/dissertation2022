Here, World Cup fever is palpable and the world's attention will be fixated on what's happening inside the stadium. Today also marks another very important day which risks getting lost in the fray -- the World Day Against Child Labor. What's the link? Those of us who have been to mega sporting events have come across children selling souvenirs and some of us may have inevitably conceded to a wide-eyed wily salespersons somewhere in our travels. But make no mistake, child labor is a serious violation of children's rights that leave them extremely vulnerable to other violations such as physical and psychological violence, abuse and sexual exploitation. Despite laws barring children under 16 from working in Brazil, today there are approximately three million Brazilian boys and girls, aged 10 to 17 years, who are victims of child labor. While we tend to downplay its importance, child labor was the form of child exploitation most often registered on the Brazilian government's Secretariat of Human Rights hotline during two major events in Brazil held in 2013.Thus, the concern with protecting Brazilian children and adolescents from child labor during the World Cup is both legitimate and necessary, particularly since many of these children come from already vulnerable groups such as girl domestic workers, boys recruited by the drug trade, black and indigenous children. Schools will be on holiday for the duration of the World Cup, making many Brazilian children even more vulnerable to different forms of child labor including the use of children for sexual exploitation purposes, pornography, forced labor and all forms of work that are likely to harm the safety, health or morals of children. While talk has centered around Brazil's stadium preparations, other types of infrastructure have been in the making. Brazil has been preparing for this moment by strengthening its child protection system's ability to prevent and respond to violence and child exploitation - including child labor. It has been raising public awareness, mobilizing law enforcement agencies and reinforcing specialized services for children. The Government also recently approved new legislation that has stricter penalities on the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents by defining it a heinous crime.A further step take was taken with an innovation that is putting child protection in the hands of citizens. The Government of Brazil, UNICEF and partners recently launched the 'Projeta Brasil' application which allows fans with a few taps on their smartphone or tablet, to immediately report cases of abuse, violence or exploitation of children, including child labor.With this app, witnesses as well as victims of child exploitation can report the time, location and circumstances to local child welfare authorities by telephone or in person triggering immediate responses from law enforcement and child protection authorities. This tool, together with a large-scale communication campaign in the 12 host cities where the games are taking place is making the invisible phenomenon of child exploitation a shared responsibility for Brazilians and tourists attending the games. This app can be downloaded from Google Play and the Apple Store, and is available in English, Spanish and Portuguese and has already been supported by numerous celebrities. As we kickoff this World Cup, let us keep in mind the lessons and legacy from South Africa's Nelson Mandela who said, ""Sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sport can create hope where once they was only despair."" Let's use that hope and work together as a team to make the start of these games the end of all forms of child labor."

I’ve said loving transgender people is revolutionary, but I think loving women — really loving women, is revolutionary too, in a social context that is deeply misogynistic, deeply does not celebrate women.

3,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Why Did Eric Cantor's Polling Get It So Wrong?,Mark Blumenthal and Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-cantor-polling_n_5486099.html,,2014-06-11,"House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., speaks at a news conference about the fiscal cliff negotiations at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Dec. 21, 2012. Hopes for avoiding the ""fiscal cliff"" that threatens the U.S. economy fell Friday after fighting among congressional Republicans cast doubt on whether any deal reached with President Barack Obama could win approval ahead of automatic tax increases and deep spending cuts kick in Jan. 1. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ccd82500008e013a5148.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We take a closer look at why two partisan polls missed Eric Cantor's surprise defeat. Economic optimism is growing. And New Yorkers are divided on ferrets. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, June 11, 2014.WHAT HAPPENED IN VA-07? - No one saw it coming. You see that phrase often in the news coverage of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's (R-Va.) upset loss to tea party candidate Dave Brat. One big source of the surprise was that two polls conducted in the final weeks before the election gave Cantor double-digit leads. When the votes were counted, however, Brat defeated Cantor by an 11 percentage point margin (56 to 45 percent). Early polls showed Cantor far ahead - An internal Cantor campaign poll of 400 likely Republican primary voters conducted two weeks before the election (May 27 to 28) by John McLaughlin of McLaughlin & Associates gave Cantor a 34 percentage point lead (62 to 28 percent), with 11 percent undecided. A second survey conducted for The Daily Caller a week later (June 2) among 583 likely Republican primary voters by the GOP firm Vox Populi Polling showed a much closer race, but still had Cantor leading by 11 percentage points (52 to 40 percent) with 9 percent undecided. [WashPost, Daily Caller]Don't trust 'internal' polls? - That's a lesson some take away. Harry Enten: ""This race is another example of why you shouldn’t trust the internal polls put out by candidates...I’ve written about the bias of internal surveys released to the public. We should assume that internal polls are biased and misleading — unless we have a good reason to think otherwise. In this case, we knew what we were getting with Cantor’s polling firm, McLaughlin & Associates. As demonstrated by Daily Kos Elections, McLaughlin has gotten many races wrong in the past two years. In Virginia, it had Mitt Romney and U.S. Senate hopeful George Allen winning their 2012 races easily. Both Republicans lost by a significant margin."" [538, McLaughlin's track record via Daily Kos Elections...but evidence the campaign believed them too - Enten's advice to be wary of publicly released surveys sponsored by campaigns and political parties is warranted, given the way their selective release creates statistical bias favoring the sponsoring party. Yet polls with partisan sponsorship have shown little collective bias in the Republican primaries so far this year, and some accounts suggest that Cantor's campaign believed their big lead in the McLaughlin poll foretold victory. ""Cantor's friends are FURIOUS,"" The Washington Post's Robert Costa reported via Twitter. ""[They] said he was told by consultants that he was up 20-30 points, didn't need to worry..."" Similarly, an unnamed Republican consultant from Virginia told Roll Call that the Cantor campaign misread an unexpectedly high turnout as good news on election day, since ""the models that they had indicated a higher turnout was going to be better for them. They completely missed it."" [HuffPollster, @costareports, Roll Call]Was methodology an issue? - Both the McLaughlin and Vox Pop poll drew their samples from official lists of registered voters, randomly selecting voters with prior histories of voting in Republican primaries to be called. The McLaughlin poll used live interviewers while the Vox Pop poll used an automated, recorded voice methodology. Beyond that, McLaughlin & Associates has disclosed little about their methodology. The automated Vox Pop poll did not attempt to identify the selected voter in each household, instead interviewing the person that answered the phone and using a screen question to toss out any that said they were not registered to vote. As such, the Vox Pop poll may have inadvertently included many voters with little or no prior history of voting in Republican primaries (11 percent said they were ""probably not voting"" in the primary, 30 percent identified as independents, 5 percent as Democrats). [Daily Caller] McLaughlin 'tries to explain': Shane Goldmacher: ""In an email to National Journal, McLaughlin, whose firm has been paid nearly $75,000 by Cantor's campaign since 2013, offered several explanations: unexpectedly high turnout, last-minute Democratic meddling, and stinging late attacks on amnesty and immigration. 'Primary turnout was 45,000 2 years ago,' McLaughlin wrote. 'This time 65,000. This was an almost 50% increase in turnout.' Translation: McLaughlin's estimate of who was a 'likely Republican' voter was way, way off the mark. But Cantor's total number of votes still shrunk, even as the total number of primary voters went up dramatically in 2014. He secured 37,369 primary votes in 2012 and less than 29,000 this year, with 100 percent of precincts reporting."" [National Journal]Democratic meddling? Dan Balz has more on McLaughlin's theory: ""In an interview, McLaughlin said the size of the turnout suggested that many Democrats and others who haven’t voted in previous primaries had shown up on Tuesday. 'We won’t know until they produce the list of who actually voted,' he said. 'Chances are a lot of them didn’t have a history of voting in Republican primaries.' He said in his polling, Cantor was winning Republicans by a margin of about seven to two. Among non-Republicans, Cantor was ahead 46-40 percent. 'Because we were surveying off lists of past primary voters, there were very few Democrats in that,' he said. Asked whether he and others in the campaign had anticipated such a surge in turnout, McLaughlin said, 'Polls don’t predict turnout. You’re trying to make assumptions of who usually votes… Here Eric got hit from the left and the right and it created a large turnout.'"" [WashPost]Or just Brat winning over independents? Vox Populi pollster Brent Seaborn, in an email to HuffPollster: ""Based off of previous primaries in Virginia’s Seventh District, it appears there was an 'Operation Chaos' type scenario where Brat successfully mobilized thousands of traditionally non-primary voters. There were 18,000 more votes cast on Tuesday than in 2012. And anti-establishment, anti-incumbent independents saw an opportunity to make a statement.”But no weak evidence for Democratic interference - Scott Clement: ""[T]he data cast doubt on whether Democratic cross-over voting caused Cantor's loss...If Democrats showed up in large numbers to vote against Cantor, turnout should have spiked highest from 2012 in Democratic-leaning areas, with Cantor seeing an especially large drop-off in support. In fact, turnout rose slightly more in counties that voted more heavily for Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. Likewise, Cantor saw the biggest drop-off in support in Republican strongholds...Turnout expert Michael McDonald of the United States Elections Project found similar results analyzing precinct-level data Tuesday night, reporting GOP primary turnout was lowest in the most Democratic-leaning areas of the state. [WashPost]What about timing? - The McLaughlin poll was conducted two weeks prior to the election, while the Vox Pop poll was fielded one week out. Vox Pop's Seaborn: ""We believe that David Brat was able to close gap pretty significantly over the last week of the campaign. Undecided voters likely broke heavily Brat's way plus the enthusiasm and momentum were on his side for turnout. Our poll of past Republican primary voters, a little more than a week before the election, showed Cantor facing the toughest race he has ever seen. We also had him losing with independents and Democrats to Brat. It is likely that those individuals could have turned out to vote on Tuesday for Brat. It will be interesting to see how many new Republican primary voters turned out in this election.""Did you vote in the VA-7 primary?

The polls were wrong, what might be the reason? Perhaps the work of some dark enchanter.Maybe immigration made some wary. Could be, too, crossover votes took a hit. Then there's risk in many a primary: Failure to project the electorate.But one thing's clear now to all our readers, Republicans need a new House leaderOBAMA APPROVAL REMAINS IN MID-40S - Julianna Goldman: ""President Barack Obama’s favorability ratings hit the lowest point of his presidency in a Bloomberg National Poll, with just 44 percent of Americans saying they have positive feelings about him. That drop in personal popularity has become a broader drag on the public’s perception of his performance in office. Obama, already given poor marks on the economy and health care, also gets low ratings on two recent political firestorms: the management of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the deal that freed the last U.S. prisoner of war in Afghanistan, according to the poll. His job-approval rating fell to 43 percent -- near the level at the end of 2013 after the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act, his signature health-care law."" [Bloomberg]ECONOMIC OPTIMISM GROWS - Steve Liesman: ""After seven long years of sharp recession and tepid recovery, the CNBC All-America Economic Survey found some key measures of U.S. public opinion finally regained their precrisis levels. Ninety-one percent of Americans now believe their home prices will either be stable or rise over the next year, the highest since March 2007. And for the first time in three years, Americans picked real estate ahead of gold as the best investment. Respondents also said they will spend about as much on a summer vacation as they did before the recession, following a sharp drop during the financial crisis.""

The Supreme Court has agreed to referee another dispute over President Barack Obama's health care law, whether businesses can use religious objections to escape a requirement to cover birth control for employees. The justices said Tuesday they will take up an issue that has divided the lower courts in the face of roughly 40 lawsuits from for-profit companies asking to be spared from having to cover some or all forms of contraception. The court will consider two cases. One involves Hobby Lobby Inc., an Oklahoma City-based arts and crafts chain with 13,000 full-time employees. Hobby Lobby won in the lower courts.

In addition, majorities of Americans said religiously affiliated hospitals (56 percent) and religiously affiliated colleges (52 percent) should be covered by the mandate.The poll found less support (51 percent) for applying the mandate to privately owned small businesses; 53 percent oppose applying the mandate to all institutions, including churches and houses of worship, while 42 percent said it should apply to them.A 2012 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 48 percent supported a religious exemption to the mandate, while 44 percent said businesses should be required to cover contraceptives like other employers. The PRRI poll asked a bit differently, asking whether institutions and businesses should be required to provide their employees with health care plans that cover contraception or birth control at no cost. Pew asked whether those groups should be extended an exemption.PRRI’s poll also found that a majority (54 percent) of Americans believe that the right of religious liberty is being threatened in America, up from 39 percent two years ago. Republicans are twice as likely as Democrats (80 percent vs. 40 percent) to say that religious liberty is being threatened.White evangelicals especially believe religious liberty is being threatened in the United States today, at 83 percent, compared to 55 percent of Catholics and 53 percent of white mainline Protestants.While more than 50 percent of Catholics believe that public and private businesses should be required to provide employees contraceptive coverage, less than half of white evangelicals support the mandate.In other findings, the poll found that even religiously unaffiliated Americans (58 percent) support public officials opening a meeting with prayer. Nearly 80 percent of Americans support allowing public officials to open meetings. The Supreme Court held last month that public officials could hold sectarian prayers."

Dozens of supporters staged a rally in front of San Francisco City Hall to support San Francisco supervisor David Campos's Harvey Milk SFO charter amendment that aims to change the name of the San Francisco International Airport to Harvey Milk SFO in honor of the Milk who was the first openly gay elected official in the United States. Milk was assassinated on November 27, 1978 along with then San Francisco Mayor George Moscone by Dan White, a San Francisco supervisor who had recently resigned. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafc7fd2200004301db1ee2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This year, the United States Postal Service released a long-awaited and overdue postage stamp in honor of a pioneering legislator and advocate not only for the civil and human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans* (LGBT) people, but for all people, especially those who had been traditionally locked out of the legislative power structure that often attempted to control their lives. The stamp bears the likeness of Harvey Bernard Milk, the first openly gay person elected to the San Francisco City Board of Supervisors in 1977, who worked for and garnered support from members of a wide coalition of groups and communities. Once in office, he was responsible for shepherding a comprehensive ordinance through the Board of Supervisors for LGBT rights, and worked successfully to defeat the draconian Proposition 6 on the November 7, 1978 California ballot sponsored by John Briggs, a conservative state legislator from Orange County, which, if passed would have mandated the firing of all LGBT public school teachers as well as anyone who supported LGBT rights in the schools. Briggs alleged that gay teachers desired to abuse, molest and ""recruit"" youth. Just three weeks later, after serving only 11 months in office, Harvey Milk and his friend and political ally, George Moscone, the Mayor of San Francisco, were brutally murdered by Dan White, another supervisor who recently quit the Board, but changed his mind and demanded to be reinstated. Controversy surrounded Harvey during his time in electoral politics, which did not end with his assassination. Following the announcement by the U.S. Postal Service, the American Family Association (AFA) initiated a two-pronged boycott of the stamp. 1. Refuse to accept the Harvey Milk stamp if offered by your local post office. Instead ask for a stamp of the United States flag. AFAs mission ""...is to inform, equip, and activate individuals to strengthen the moral foundations of American culture, and give aid to the church here and abroad in its task of fulfilling the Great Commission,"" and to ""...restrain evil by exposing the works of darkness"" by ""championing Christian activism."" AFA justifies its action: The Harvey Milk stamp was a result of seven years of lobbying by a self-described drag queen (a biologi [California] man with implanted breasts) and former transsexual prostitute Nicole Murray Ramirez of San Diego. Honoring predator Harvey Milk on a U.S. postage stamp is disturbing to say the least. Harvey Milk was a very disreputable man and used his charm and power to prey on young boys with emotional problems and drug addiction. He is the last person we should be featuring on a stamp.In actuality, no amount of cissuppremist rantings by the AFA will ever diminish Nicole Murray Ramirez' integrity and groundbreaking lobbying efforts for the establishment of a postage stamp and California state holiday to honor civil right pioneer, Cesar Chavez. A crucial point in the psychology of stereotyping and scapegoating is the representation of minoritized groups as, in historian John Boswell's words, ""animals bent on the destruction of the children of the majority,"" and dominant groups have long accused LGBT people of acting as dangerous predators of young people.Former beauty queen and Florida Orange Juice Commission spokesperson, Anita Bryant, for example, spearheaded her so-called ""Save Our Children"" campaign, which succeeded in overturning a gay-rights ordinance in Dade Country, Florida in 1977. The ordinance was finally reinstated in 1998. According to Bryant, ""a particularly deviant-minded [gay] teacher could sexually molest children."" These stereotypes have been validated institutionally. The 1992 Republican Party platform openly endorsed this oppression, stating that ""[The Republican Party] opposes any legislation or law which legally recognizes same-sex marriages and allows such couples to adopt children or provide foster care."" In fact, some states still explicitly ban LGBT people from adopting or serving as foster parents.In recent years, the fear of alleged pedophilia has been used to justify the ban on gay and bisexual boy scouts, and today, to continue the Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay and bisexual scoutmasters as argued by Rob Schwarzwalder, 2013, vice president of the conservative Washington, DC-based public policy and lobbying organization, Family Research Council (FRC): ""The reality is, homosexuals have entered the Scouts in the past for predatory purposes."" Tony Perkins, FRC President, in a 2011 fundraising letter for the organization addressing the LGBT communities' so-called public promotion of homosexuality to youth, wrote: The videos are titled 'It Gets Better.' They are aimed at persuading kids that although they'll face struggles and perhaps bullying for 'coming out' as homosexual (or transgendered or some other perversion), life will get better... It's disgusting. And it's part of a concerted effort to persuade kids that homosexuality is okay and actually to recruit them into that lifestyle.And last June, the Russian Parliament passed and President Vladimir Putin signed its ""anti-homosexual propaganda"" law specifically targeting ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors,"" including public discussions, events that ""promote"" LGBT rights, such as Pride marches, and public displays of affection by same-sex couples that children might see or hear.But the good news is that because of brave, courageous and forward-thinking pioneers like Harvey, no amount of intimidation will ever lock us away again. Lesbians, gay males, bisexuals, asexuals, trans* and intersex people and our loving and supportive heterosexual and cisgender allies are coming out in greater numbers than ever before. As marginalized people, we are pushing the boundaries unwilling any longer to accept the repressive status quo. In coalition with other disenfranchised groups and allies, we are refusing to buckle under and to assimilate into a corrupt and corrupting system that forces people to relinquish their integrity and their humanity.Harvey recorded a will that was to be played in the event of his assassination. In it he stated that he never considered himself simply as a candidate for public office, but rather, always considered himself as part of a liberation movement for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans* people, and a liberation movement for all people.   Each time Harvey spoke in front of a crowd, he urged people to come out everywhere and often: ""Tell your immediate family,"" he would say. ""Tell friends, neighbors, people in the stores you shop in, cab drivers, everyone."" And he urged heterosexual and cisgender people to be our allies, to interrupt derogatory remarks and jokes, to support us and offer aid when needed. If we all did this, he said, we could change the world. I never met Harvey Milk, but I feel that I knew him on a deep personal level. His murder hit me like the death of an old, trusted friend. His loss to me remains palpable. In his relatively brief time with us, Harvey Milk left an indelible mark and invaluable gift by changing lives. He has earned the lasting, enthusiastic and unqualified esteem of the countless people he touched, and we deeply and sorely miss him. During his time here, he did not simply walk, but in fact, he paved a path of justice and decency.Though his killer may have destroyed his body, and his detractors then and now may have attempted to slander his reputation and malign and vilify his work, they will never succeed in extinguishing his legacy or destroying his spirit, or in terminating the heart of a community and a movement for social justice, for Harvey's life-force continues, inspiring a new generation, a nation, and a world. For us all, I do believe that love will conquer the hatred. Harvey, thank you for the riches you left us.

7,STYLE,Kelly Osbourne: 'A Lot Of Girls Don't Like To Think Outside Of The Box',Sasha Bronner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kelly-osbourne-mac-cosmetics_n_5455767.html,,2014-06-11,"NEW YORK, NY - MAY 15: Kelly Osbourne attends the 2014 NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Upfronts at The Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on May 15, 2014 in New York City. (Photo by D Dipasupil/FilmMagic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e20c32100003100c5caad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When we heard that Kelly Osbourne was creating her own line for MAC Cosmetics, we giggled with glee. Once just a famous face on an MTV reality show, Osbourne has transformed into a style powerhouse with her fearless fashion choices and daring purple hair. But the 29-year-old ""Fashion Police"" host is the first to admit that her style is polarizing, to say the least. We sat down with Osbourne to learn about her foray into cosmetics, what her dad taught her about beauty and the hardest thing about rocking that hairstyle. Highlights from our chat are below.HuffPost: What did you find challenging about creating this makeup line?Kelly Osbourne: I made myself so incredibly nervous. It’s just that my style is very eclectic and not for everyone. Many people don’t like me. And so when I was making this collection, I had to leave my ego at the door. I wanted to make something for every woman, but with a hint of me. Why do you think some people do not identify with your style?I walk around with purple hair! And I understand that the things that I’m into artistically are not for everyone. I love vulgarity. And people consider it ugly but I like to change our perspectives on what we consider vulgar or ugly, and find a way to make it work. I think that’s the challenge with everything I do fashion-wise, whether it’s makeup, clothes, shoes or accessories. I love pushing the boundaries but I do realize that takes a lot of courage and bravery. A lot of girls don’t like to think outside of the box, so I had to be very careful about not going too far.Do you consider yourself a style icon? Well, certain celebrities even have the same hair as me now, which I love! It makes me feel like I’ve achieved something or changed perspectives. Which makeup product can you not live without?I always wear a bit of [MAC] Face and Body whenever I get a zit since my skin will stay slightly pink or red for a while. So I like to put on a light coat of Face and Body to even out my skin pigmentation. I only wear MAC makeup, so if anything ever happened to the brand I think I would commit Hari-Kari because I don’t know what I would wear. What is your earliest makeup memory?When I was 13, my mom took me to MAC and got me a makeup lesson where I picked out a concealer, a blush, a powder and a mascara. That was all I was allowed to wear because my father didn’t like it. When I was a little tiny kid, I had this mannequin doll and I could do its hair and makeup. But I used to put the makeup on myself and I remember my dad saying, “No child of mine will be wearing makeup at your age!” He was very strict about it. He doesn’t like when I wear “too much makeup,” as he calls it. But ""too much"" to him is literally blush and concealer.What’s the best beauty lesson you’ve learned from your dad?My dad is the king of eyeliner. It’s something he’s worn since he was younger than me. He was 19. It’s a part of his performance. But he has always taught me that less is more.What's the hardest thing about rocking an undercut?In actuality, having an undercut is very easy for me because I have so much hair that the cut makes it easier to maintain. As kooky as it may sound to some people, it's probably the most manageable cut I've ever had. And it’s so versatile—I can part it and have a bob or I can put it up for an updo. I love it!What was it like working side-by-side with your mom on the MAC collection?It's been fun getting to spend more time with her because we don't get to work together very often anymore. But she did her collection and I did mine. We bounced ideas off of each other, of course. And out of everything, the photo shoot was the most fun because we got to be proper divas!How difficult is it to live under the Hollywood microscope?Life is difficult in general whether you're under a microscope or not. My microscope just happens to be extremely large, and people get to form an opinion on every aspect of my life. Whether you're under the Hollywood microscope or not though, growing up is hard on anyone.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

Jim Ball, ContributorAuthor, 'Global Warming and the Risen LORD: Christian Disciple...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mcconnell-and-grimes_b_5462473.html,"Here's the truth: The words of Secretary Grimes are the opposite of true leadership, fostering false hope for personal political gain, pretending you can ""protect"" coal industry jobs by attacking a scapegoat, EPA's carbon regulations.",2014-06-11,"Kentucky Democratic senatorial candidate Allison Lundergan Grimes speaks with a reporter before the start of the 50th annual Kentucky Country Ham Breakfast, Thursday, Aug. 22, 2013, at the Kentucky State Fairgrounds in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15878260000cf00818634.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There's not a dime's bit of difference between them. That's the conclusion I draw after reading what Kentucky's two candidates for the U.S. Senate said about the draft carbon pollution regulation of existing power plants recently released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), called the Clean Power Plan. Here's what the incumbent and Republican Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, had to say:""Today's announcement is a dagger in the heart of the American middle class, and to representative Democracy itself.""And here's what Sen. McConnell's Democratic challenger, Kentucky's Secretary of State, Allison Grimes, said:""When I'm in the U.S. Senate, I will fiercely oppose the President's attack on Kentucky's coal industry because protecting our jobs will be my number one priority.""What do you think? Any daylight between them? Or are they standing together to block out the rays from our country's brighter clean energy future?I'm guessing that my ""not a dime's bit of difference"" conclusion is just fine with the Democratic challenger -- it's exactly what she was shooting for: no daylight.The shadowy truth is, they're both wrong.And here's another unpleasant truth: I'm especially disappointed in Secretary Grimes.There's no doubt that Sen. McConnell is one of the most powerful opponents of climate action in our country. Enough said.But those in favor of strong climate action cannot turn a blind eye to the shortsighted words of Secretary Grimes. She's wrong, too. And it's time for climate action advocates to stop giving coal-state and oil-patch Democrats a pass for the sake of political expediency. If climate action isn't partisan, then neither can our truth-telling be partisan. Here's the truth: The words of Secretary Grimes are the opposite of true leadership, fostering false hope for personal political gain, pretending you can ""protect"" coal industry jobs by attacking a scapegoat, EPA's carbon regulations. Real, genuine concern for Kentucky's workers would work for transitioning Kentucky's economy away from an industry that will continue to shed jobs even without carbon regulations. Her own state government has been saying this for years, concentrating on energy diversification. This has included efforts on energy efficiency and conservation and capturing carbon and making money off of it. (See for yourself in this video from the University of Kentucky showing how algae that soaks up carbon can be turned into fuels for vehicles, jets or the power plant itself.) Her own state government provided EPA with a major report on what the best approach would be for Kentucky to meet its obligations, and the EPA Clean Power Plan gave them what they asked for.Her own state government's proposal had a tougher target than the EPA's Plan does.   Thus, the EPA's Clean Power Plan is quite generous to Kentucky.But here's the kicker: The EPA can't give Kentucky everything it needs and deserves from our country to meet this new obligation. We're in this together, and we want to be fair to each state in terms of burden-sharing and honest recognition of how other states benefit from Kentucky manufacturing, manufacturing that provides cheaply priced but carbon intense goods to other states. (A key reason they are cheap is because the pollution isn't included in the price; and it is in our national interest not to have such manufacturing move overseas.)Simply looking at raw numbers, Kentucky has 12,400 coal jobs, but 220,000 in manufacturing. A recent study concluded that ""a 25 percent increase in electricity prices would be associated with a net loss of 30,000 full-time jobs, primarily in the manufacturing sector."" That's more than double the total of all coal jobs.It's only fair that a national policy that benefits all of us -- the EPA Clean Power Plan -- not disproportionately impact Kentucky's workers. And so our nation must partner with Kentucky's efforts in energy efficiency and clean energy and carbon capture and utilization (e.g. the algae) to make sure Kentucky manufacturing isn't put at a competitive disadvantage. And these and other efforts must help provide coal workers who need it a smooth transition to well-paying jobs.But to do this will take more than the EPA's Clean Power Plan, because the agency can't pass laws; it can't make things completely fair between states. Only Congress and the President can do that.So, Secretary Grimes, instead of painting yourself into a corner and giving away your leverage at the get-go in the carbon policy fight, why not use these very regulations as an opportunity to have the country do the right thing by Kentucky's coal and manufacturing workers?How could Secretary Grimes have said it differently? How about this:""I cannot support -- indeed, I must oppose -- EPA's carbon regulations until the country is ready to provide a fair deal to Kentucky's coal and manufacturing workers and communities.""Sounds good to me.The Rev. Jim Ball, Ph.D., is author of Global Warming and the Risen LORD."
