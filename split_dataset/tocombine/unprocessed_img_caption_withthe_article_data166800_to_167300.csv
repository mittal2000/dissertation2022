0,DIVORCE,The Life-Changing News I Got Post-Split,"Beth Smith, Contributor
High School Teacher, Mother",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/post_us_5b9cb2e9e4b03a1dcc80feae,"My parents were shocked and, I think for the first time in my life, a little disappointed in me.",2013-01-09,"young caucasian woman in tanktop holding pregnancy test, waiting for results. Horizontal shape, cropped view",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb2e93c00004c0009dce2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Living in London, I can honestly say I had no idea who Kim Kardashian was until I read about her getting double pink lines before a divorce decree. So now we have something in common. Four years ago I found myself driving to the supermarket at midnight to get the fifth pregnancy test after the last four had been positive. I was on the pill, recently separated and desperately shocked. I had sworn that my then three-year-old daughter would be raised an only child and that I definitely did not want any more children.I separated from my first husband in August 2008. We'd been married for five years but we had married too young and were more like brother and sister than husband and wife. By Christmas, I had moved back into my parents' home with my daughter and started casually seeing someone else. He hadn't met my family, I doubt he knew my birthday or my favorite color, but somehow, in spite of being very careful, by March I was pregnant with his child. On paper I was still married to my first husband when my son was born in October 2009.The pregnancy was not easy for anyone. I hadn't had time to get used to being separated, let alone becoming a new and unplanned mum. I was working full-time and my daughter was adjusting to a shared custody agreement, suddenly having to deal with a new brother who had a different Daddy. My boyfriend was unemployed, still living with his parents and, at 23, definitely not keen on becoming a young father. My parents were shocked and, I think for the first time in my life, a little disappointed in me. I spent the first few weeks sobbing in between arguing with my boyfriend about the future and trying to explain to my gorgeously confused daughter that it was ok for children to have the same Mummy and different Daddies.Then there was my ""husband"" to cope with. I thought the best way was to keep it from him as long as possible -- at least until my 20 week scan, but in the end I told him at 9 weeks. We were in McDonalds on a shared outing with our daughter who was in the play area (we still do shared outings every two weeks and it's the best thing for our co-parenting) and he told me that he had started dating and was feeling happy at last. I suddenly blurted out that I was expecting and nervously awaited his reaction. He did blanche for a minute or two and there was an horrifically awkward silence during which both of us welled up. In a way, this was me telling him that our separation was permanent. Afterwards he told me he was happy for me and would support me in any way he could, including trying to rush through an online divorce. After an awful eight months of distance between us, this conversation was the start of a new mutual respect and friendship with my now ex-husband which has lasted and served us well as our daughter has grown.My boyfriend and I were hanging on by a very fine thread and I had faced the fact that I was going to be a single mother. I felt certain that he was not ready to commit to fatherhood and the shock had caused him to rebel and revert to teenage-style drinking and partying while I sat at home with bad morning sickness getting fatter. I felt as though I was drifting through my second trimester on a sea of uncertainty, still shocked at what had happened. Less than a year before I had been in a model family, and now I was bringing an accidental child into a broken home.And then something amazing happened. At my twenty-week scan the sonographer turned the screen away suddenly and went to get his superior. I knew that something was wrong and we were eventually told that my baby was a boy but that all was not well. I had developed early pre-eclampsia and my son still had a beating heart but had stopped growing at 18 weeks. My boyfriend held my hand and it was the first meaningful intimacy between us for a long time. I have to confess that up to this moment, I had seen my baby as an unwanted accidental inconvenience. I had been so concerned about the difficulties of a fragmented family that I hadn't considered how much I had become attached to my growing bump. Sitting in the doctor's office listening to the terribly negative prognosis, I wept as my boyfriend held me and just said ""It's a boy"". He's always been such an optimist. Bizarrely, one of the first people I called was my husband. He felt for me and agreed to care for our daughter for a few weeks while I tried to deal with the trauma.Our story has a happy ending. I was put on medication and, with three months in the hospital on bed-rest, I managed to cling on until my son was born, prematurely, weighing two pounds. He has a rare genetic condition which means that his physical growth is slow, but to us, he is perfection personified.Somewhere between that scan and the many more that followed it, my boyfriend and I fell in love with each other and with our son. In short, he grew up and became an amazing father and there is nothing more attractive than an amazing father.My ex-husband fell in love again, my parents are the most loving grandparents and my daughter has a brother she adores. We are a blended family in the truest sense and we co-parent with love. And my divorce? We finally got around to it in June 2010 when my son was almost a year old. I married my son's father this past July."

Most of us attempt to acheive creamy perfection through copious amounts of cream and butter unaware that there's a better (and healthier) way. Even though we're big fans of how all that fat makes the potatoes taste, it's probably not a good idea to be consuming a mountain of butter on a regular basis. (Yes, we want our mashed potatoes on a regular basis.) And thanks to the folks at MDRN KTCHN, you don't have to. MDRN KTCHN shared their secret to getting the creamiest mashed potatoes and it comes in the form of diastatic malt powder (and is a completely dairy-free recipe). This natural ingredient breaks down the big potato starch molecules into smaller sugar ones. This means that even on a microscopic level your potatoes are creamier and slightly sweeter.

2,TRAVEL,3 Troubling Ways The TSA Punishes Passengers Who Opt Out,"Christopher Elliott, Contributor
Author, How to Be the World's Smartest Traveler (and Save Time...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-troubling-ways-the-tsa_us_5b9cb3d4e4b03a1dcc810379,"When we're screened at the airport, we're separate, but we're not equal.",2013-01-09,"FILE - In this Nov. 17, 2011 photo, travelers move through the security area of Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, N.J. After a man was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport wearing a bulletproof vest, flame-resistant pants and had a suitcase full of weapons, the TSA has restated what air travelers are allowed to bring along. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb3d42500003600362c39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you don't want to walk through a poorly tested full-body scanner or have a TSA agent belittle your anatomy before your next flight, then you still have the right to opt out and submit to an ""enhanced"" pat-down.That's exactly what I did on a recent trip from Orlando to Atlanta. Actually, I do it every time I fly.But as I waited for a male agent -- who would ask me to spread my legs, would touch my torso, rub the inside of my legs and feel the back of my neck and arms -- I began to understand what the TSA really means when it says it's focusing its efforts on ""intelligence-driven, risk-based screening procedures.""It means that when we're screened at the airport, we're separate, but we're not equal. A new passenger underclassThe TSA likes to talk about the ""haves"" -- the elite-level frequent fliers, the soldiers in uniform, the crewmembers, who can now almost always bypass the scanners, the shoe-removal and the pat-downs, and get to the gate quickly. It's received a lot of positive coverage from an unskeptical mainstream media about those programs.But it doesn't really say much about the ""have-nots"" -- the passengers with medical conditions and implants that set off the magnetometers, the folks who don't fly frequently enough to be part of the Pre-Check club and yeah, the opt-outs.Actually, opt-outs are arguably the biggest segment of the new passenger underclass. The TSA doesn't release statistics on air travelers who refuse a full-body scan, but anecdotal evidence suggests their numbers are large and growing. Let's take a closer look at how the TSA treats opt-outs as second class citizens.Intimidation. As I waited for my TSA screener in Orlando, I noticed an attractive young woman standing next to me. ""Opting out?"" I asked her. She nodded. I made eye contact with her, which is when I saw a look that can be best described as raw terror. It is the anticipation of what may come next, whether it's a botched pat-down that violates your human dignity or a public humiliation, that stokes those fears. I admit, I experience similar misgivings every time I tell an agent that I'd rather not go through the scanner. My only consolation is that if something goes wrong, I can write about it.Harassment. As it turns out, our fears are somewhat justified. Last week, I heard from Maura Maia, a flight attendant for a major airline, who says that while she enjoys breezing through the crewmember line when she's in uniform, the treatment is vastly different when she's off the clock. She recently flew in civilian clothes and opted out. ""The TSA agent started yelling at me when I said I wasn't going into the full-body scan,"" she says. Maia stood her ground, but says ""I was humiliated in public."" She adds, ""When I came back to the same airport, that time on my uniform, and tried to file a complaint with the TSA supervisor, he waved me away."" The TSA can't force you through the scanners, but it will try. Yelling at passengers is unacceptable.Retaliatory wait time. That's a term believed to be widely used within the TSA, and it means exactly what it says. If you opt out, you could be forced to wait -- and possibly miss your flight. But it's not just the length of the wait, it's also the place. Passengers are sometimes herded to a secure holding area, which functions like a penalty box in a hockey game. You can see who is in it, and by being in it, you're assumed to have done something wrong. It's embarrassing, and the TSA agents keeping you in the box know it. Of course, some would argue that the ""enhanced"" pat-down is also retaliatory, and in the hands of some screeners, it certainly can be.But why is this happening? For TSA agents, opt-outs are a pain. They have to explain the pat-down procedure, put on a pair of blue latex gloves, get moved from their duty station and, worst of all, there's a pretty good chance the traveler will object to the manual screening in some way. When that happens, a supervisor must be summoned and possibly the airport police, since TSA agents have no law enforcement authority. It can get really messy.For the TSA as an institution, opt-outs are an easily identifiable group of contrarians who do inconvenient things like vote for candidates who push for more agency oversight, write to their congressional representative when they fail to hold the TSA accountable for its failures and demand common-sense security instead of the circus we still have today, more than a decade after the 9/11 attacks. Punishing these passengers makes sense on an institutional level, so it's no surprise that supervisors would look the other way while agents threaten, intimidate and humiliate the opt-outs, if not encourage it.The false choice between a dangerous scan and an invasive pat-down must end, and the sooner it happens, the better.In the meantime, here's an idea: Why not give anyone who opts-out the same treatment as the folks with Pre-Check clearance? Why not just send them through the metal detector, allowing them to keep their shoes and jackets on?No self-respecting terrorist would ever ask for a pat-down instead of walking through the easily foiled body scanners. The opt-outs present no meaningful threat to airport security. The TSA should screen them with the pre-checks and pilots instead of penalizing them for doing what every passenger should be doing in the first place.By the way, after you've left a comment here, let's continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google.

3,WELLNESS,Weight Loss Surgery Side Effects: Procedure's Not-So-Glamorous Side Highlighted By Al Roker's Embarrassing Story,Sarah Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/weight-loss-surgery-side-effects-al-roker_us_5b9cb41de4b03a1dcc8107fd,Some weight-loss surgery patients may develop ulcers at the site where the small intestine is connected to the pocket created,2013-01-09,"NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 28: Al Roker attends Jay-Z in concert at the Barclays Center on September 28, 2012 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. (Photo by Robin Marchant/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb41d240000510094c956.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By now, you've probably heard about Al Roker's unfortunate bathroom-related incident at -- of all places -- the White House. Perhaps almost as surprising as the headlines themselves was the admission that the embarrassing episode was an often-ignored side effect of weight loss surgery. ""I probably went off and ate something I wasn't supposed to,"" he said on NBC's ""Dateline.""""Which is a common side effect of the surgery,"" NBC's Dr. Nancy Snyderman responded. The weatherman wasn't always so open about discussing his 2002 procedure. ""In this country, if you have an alcohol problem or a drug problem, you can get treatment,"" Roker told USA Today after months of keeping mum about his dramatic weight loss. ""If you have a weight problem, it's lack of willpower: 'Just push away from the table, tubby, and you'd lose that weight.' But you can stop drinking, you can stop sticking a needle in your arm. You cannot not eat.""Other celebs, like Carnie Wilson and Lisa Lampanelli, have also come forward about going under the knife to get slim, but there's an atmosphere of secrecy around such procedures similar to the ""did she or didn't she?"" whispers about cosmetic surgery. Weight-loss surgery, however, may come with additional stigma, as if diet and exercise changes weren't enough. In the same USA Today interview, Roker called owning up to his surgery ""the ultimate admission of failure.""Still, the famous faces who do go public with bariatric surgery are showered with praise for their smaller size. And instead of talking about the risks of elective surgery or the myriad side effects, stars often explain that they're feeling better than ever and loving their new look. ""I have been struggling with weight from age 18 to now -- that's 32 years of diets,"" Lampanelli said on a recent visit to HuffPost Live. ""I'd had enough… but it's great, we needed to do it. I've done everything from really unhealthy stuff to healthy diets, but it just wasn't for me.""Bariatric surgery aims to ""reduce the amount people can consume at a given time and the amount of digested food they can absorb,"" the New York Times reported. There are a number of procedures that fall under this umbrella that can achieve the same end result. Gastric bypass surgery entails creating a small pocket toward the top of the stomach and sealing off the rest, according to WebMD, thereby bypassing some of the small intestin so that fewer calories are absorbed from the food traveling through.Lampanelli underwent gastric sleeve surgery, she said, which actually involves removal of part of the stomach. And Rex Ryan opted for lap band surgery, in which an inflatable silicon ring seals off part of the stomach.Roker's incident was certainly embarrassing, but not uncommon. In fact, both fecal and urinary incontinence are common side effects, possibly because surgery may expose ""prior weaknesses in the continence mechanism,"" according to a 2010 study. In the study, 55 percent of women and 31 percent of men with fecal incontinence felt their condition worsened after surgery.But other side effects of weight-loss surgery can be dangerous and even life-threatening. Eating too quickly, taking big bites, not chewing enough or eating foods that are too dry can bring on nausea or vomiting in many people after weight-loss surgery, and too much sugary or greasy food can lead to diarrhea. More than a third of patients develop gallstones, masses of cholesterol that form in the gallbladder, after surgery, according to WebMD.About 20 percent of people who opt for weight-loss surgery require further procedures for complications, WebMD reported, and as many as 30 percent deal with complications relating to malnutrition, like anemia or osteoporosis, since the intestines are absorbing fewer nutrients.Some weight-loss surgery patients may develop ulcers at the site where the small intestine is connected to the pocket created from the stomach, especially those who take aspirin or NSAIDs, according to the Mayo Clinic. A stoma, or a narrowing of the opening at this same site, may also occur, and require surgery to repair. Patients are also at risk for dehydration, since the stomach can no longer hold large quantities of water. And rapid weight loss can bring on feelings of fatigue, cold, mood changes and body aches, as well as cause hair thinning.In rare instances, some patients may experience a serious complication called Noninsulinoma Pancreatogenous Hypoglycemia Syndrome (NIPHS), or very low blood sugar levels. In these cases, patients may experience neurologic symptoms like confusion or even seizures, according to the Mayo Clinic, and could require pancreatic surgery to cure.Tragically, bariatric surgery patients seem to also be at greater risk of suicide, according to a review of nearly 17,000 operations performed from 1995 to 2004 in Pennsylvania. The researchers calculated suicide rates among the patients to be more than five times higher than the rate in the general population, the New York Times reported.This could at least in part be due to the tremendous work required to maintain the results of weight-loss surgery. The procedure itself is not a quick fix; a number of habits have to change as well, if the weight loss is to be permanent, and as many as 20 percent of people will gain a significant amount of weight back, People magazine reported.Appetite and emotional cravings don't shrink just because stomach size does, and emotional issues need to be addressed. When they aren't, some patients, fall into a ""rebound relationship with something else"" reported ABC News, namely, alcohol, drugs or cigarettes. ""Many people who undergo bariatric surgery struggle with eating in response to different emotional cues,"" Alexis Conason of the New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center, told ABC News. ""I [wondered] what happened afterward. If they are no longer able to cope with their emotions through eating... do they turn to something like drugs or alcohol to serve the purpose that food did originally."" Conason's survey found that surgery patients had a 50 percent increase in frequency of substance abuse two years after their operations.While recent research suggests that weight loss surgery may be effective in preventing Type 2 diabetes (assuming the necessary lifestyle changes are made), it's important that even the most highly-qualified surgery patients weigh the risks before opting for a surgical solution. Roker's weight loss isn't the only high-profile, dramatic transformation of late. Check out some of our favorite celebrity weight loss stories of 2012 in the slideshow below."
4,WELLNESS,Neuroscientist Says Green Consciousness Is in Right Brain,"Linda Buzzell, Contributor

Here are some images related to neurosciences. Some have been used for conferences. Copyright (c) 2003 Nicolas P. Rougier ... ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb0d12400003200534c66.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When neuroscientist Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor had a stroke that put her logical, sequential left brain temporarily out of commission, she experienced a temporary state of peaceful, all-connected consciousness that changed her forever. She described this in her best-selling book My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientist's Personal Journey. At first she saw this intuitive and wholistic right brain state as crucial to human mental health but after a visit to Antarctica with Al Gore she began to see how it might also offer clues about how a desperately-needed new eco-consciousness might be as close as the right side of our brains. She describes this in a Jan. 4, 2013 Huffington Post  story, ""Does Our Planet Need a Stroke of Insight""? But how to experience this right-brain eco-connection without having to go through a potentially deadly stroke?The idea of using various methods for accessing the right brain isn't new, of course. Far from it. But the recent emphasis seems to have been on how to connect with this side of ourselves merely so we can succeed at some left brain activity like business or goal-oriented sports. Taylor's critical insight is that by entering this altered, nonlinear state of consciousness we may reconnect with an important awareness that, when combined with the more practical, rational left-brain insights of science, might allow us to more effectively address our current environmental situation.Once we understand the domains of the right and left brain hemispheres, many options appear. The left brain (which controls the right side of the body) is generally agreed to dominate functions like speech, logic, detail, science, math, planning, order, thinking, writing and a sense of the separate self. The right brain seems to focus more on a holistic sense of connection, images, stories, music, intuitive awareness of patterns, beauty and imagination. Methods of connecting with the right brain (and thus balancing the brain hemispheres) are as old as humanity. Most indigenous cultures were well aware of them: story-telling, art, connecting with the beauty of nature, ingesting mind-altering plants under controlled conditions, making music, aromatherapy, body therapies, sex, humor, dreaming, stream of consciousness writing, meditation, religious ceremony and prayer are just a few.For those of us interested in how right-brain connection could alter our species' presently destructive relationship with the rest of nature, it seems critical that many more people experience the holistic, blissful feeling of oneness with all there is in our amazing universe.And perhaps the simplest way of doing that is finding ways for more of us -- especially children -- to connect with the rest of nature, however that is available to us. Here are a few possibilities: gardening; going outdoors and simply opening ourselves to the beauty of plants, trees, mountains, water; connecting with other animals (even domesticated animals); drawing and painting in nature; making music outdoors; watching our dreams for images of nature and what they might be telling us; connecting with the wild nature in our bodies through various body therapies; joining others for meditation and prayer outdoors.I'd love to hear others' suggestions about how this might be possible.For more by Linda Buzzell, click here.For more on the mind, click here."
