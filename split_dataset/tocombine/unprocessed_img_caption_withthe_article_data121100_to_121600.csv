0,BUSINESS,Don Draper and Steve Jobs Have Much in Common,"Spiros Margaris, ContributorInvestment Strategist, Innovation Consultant, Investment Advis...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/don-draper-and-steve-jobs_b_5304091.html,,2014-05-12,2014-05-12-SpirosMargarisSteveJobsandTimCookquoteSM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-12-SpirosMargarisSteveJobsandTimCookquoteSM-thumb.png,"What does Don Draper and Steve Jobs have in common and why does it matter? It should matter to you if you own or plan to purchase shares in Apple Inc. And it should matter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, if he wants to prove his critics wrong that the best days of Apple are behind it. It's time for Tim Cook and his team to do some soul-searching despite Apple's success. Everyone knows Steve Jobs, co-founder and former Apple CEO, who passed away on Oct. 5, 2011. Besides his incredible emphasis on focus and simplicity, he was also a creative genius and most importantly a visionary leader.On the other hand, not everyone will know who Don Draper is. He is an advertising genius at the New York ad agency Sterling Cooper & Partners in the critically acclaimed AMC American television drama series Mad Men. Both companies -- Don Draper's fictional ad agency Sterling Cooper & Partners and Steve Jobs' Apple -- believe that everything is just fine without the marketing geniuses of the two visionary leaders shaping their companies future.Of course at Apple, the choice is not anymore theirs, since Steve Jobs is dead. Whereas Don Draper is alive but just not anymore needed or wanted at his firm (Mad Men season 7 episode 4, ""The Monolith"") regardless of his advertising genius. Both are very much needed at their respective companies. Both men made their companies great. Both men have something that you cannot bottle but it so important to the success and future of their companies.That is the common thread between Don Draper and Steve Jobs. Don Draper made his advertisement (ad) agency great by producing great ad campaigns for its clients. Steve Jobs made Apple great by giving us great product categories such the iPod, iPhone, iPad and Apple's intuitive user experience. If companies fail to provide its customers with what they used to expect from them and beyond, with other words, if they fail to keep doing what made them great in the first place they are doomed to fail. Despite Apple's strong earnings, huge cash reserves of $150 billion, buyback program, and stock split (7-1) seem at first glance as great news they might just disguise problems beneath it.To better understand Apple's potential problem we use the metaphor of a car rolling down a hill. How can you determine the reason(s) for the speed of a car rolling down a hill? Can the car speed be explained due to the slope of the hill, or due to a combination of the slope and the current or previous car speed? With other words can Apple current success be explained through its past strategic initiatives and successes, or through its new strategic initiatives, or a combination of both? The answer might shed some light on Apple's capability to keep producing strong numbers and coming up with great product categories and ideas in the future.Without new innovative, game-changing products, Apple might just be a car rolling down the hill with some impressive speed, but nevertheless no much gas left in the fuel tank.The Apple brand is still very strong, but we are missing Steve Jobs who made people and investors dream of wonderful inventions to come next from Cupertino.The final proof is in the (Apple's) pudding. We will have to wait until Tim Cook reveals the next product category. However some investors will not wait to taste the pudding, or hear the news of a new product category announcement. As the old stock market saying goes: ""Buy the rumor, sell the news.""Apple's potential acquisition of Beats Electronics, the premium consumer headphones maker and streaming music subscription service, for $3.2 billion, might just be a further strong indication that Apple has lost its way since Steve Jobs' death. The stock price is not the reflection of the present, but of the future to come. So if we believe that Apple lost its innovation mojo, then it is only a question of time before the stock price will correct itself.Steve Jobs was able to make us all believe in his vision that there will be a better future with great new products still to come from Apple.Many believe that Tim Cook does an excellent job, but can he do Steve's job(s)?Tim Cook is very much needed at Apple, but he needs also Steve Jobs' visionary leadership. The truth is that they both needed each other to shine. As Aristotle said: ""The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.""Everybody is replaceable, so they say but great and exceptional people are not easily or at all replaceable. Great employee and leaders such as the late Steve Jobs define a business, much more than its products or technology. ""If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader."" -- John Quincy AdamsFinally, we come back to why it matters what Don Draper and Steve Jobs have in common.You can lead the ad agency Sterling Cooper & Partners without Don Draper. You can lead Apple without Steve Jobs. However, in both cases you will need to replace them with someone who can (with obviously their own personal leadership style and vision) bring back what made the company great in the first place. What makes a company great will obviously differ from company to company but the time will come when we know the truth if the management truly knew. Maybe the solution of how Apple could get back its innovative edge can be found in Steve Jobs' inspiring 2005 Stanford commencement address.If Apple wants to stay relevant for the future to come it should reflect on Steve Jobs' words that closed his speech. ""Stay hungry. Stay foolish."""

It is an anchor on which our future hinges.",2014-05-12,"Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the leaders of the member states of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, May 8, 2014. (AP Photo/RIA-Novosti, Alexei Nikolsky, Presidential Press Service)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13600230000330093cb60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In early November, every four years, Americans go to the polls to elect a president. This is an integral part of a checks-and-balances system on which America is built, but much of the world doesn't have that luxury. Such simplicity, predictability, and basic guarantee of voice to the ordinary citizens, those are the things many people crave, but few have access to. This year we -- the Ukrainians -- have fought for our dignity, for our right to self-determination, for our right to responsible government. And the elections, which are scheduled for May 25, are far more than an opportunity to choose a president. It is an anchor on which our future hinges. Our country is populated by many nationalities, but ethnic violence was never a problem at a scale where it claimed lives, until it was exported from the North. We've surrendered our nuclear arsenal, third largest in the world, in exchange for security guarantees. Unthinkably, Russia, a party to this agreement, which had pledged to protect our territorial integrity, has instead violated it. In such dire circumstances, our leaders and our military have shown incomparable restraint. The aggressor, not a nation defending its land, fired the first shot that took a life of our officer. To the dismay of many Ukrainians in Crimea who felt betrayed, we called back the troops and prevented escalation of violence on the peninsula at the expense of losing our territory, even if only temporarily. The U.S. and the UK were parties to the security agreement as well, and it must be said, that had we chosen to shoot back at the Russian troops, the policy choices for our allies would've been much more stark. A peaceful nation, we want good relations with all of our neighbors. Our interim president, our prime minister, and our minister of foreign affairs have reached out to their counterparts in Moscow on many occasions, but to no avail. If Kremlin genuinely wished us well, it would have supported our desire to end this transition period and move forward as a nation led by a popularly elected president. In other words, the hope for peace and security at this very difficult time rests on the elections. On May 25, we aren't just choosing a leader, we are trying to close a page in a chapter of our history when our country was run by ""crooks and thieves"" and treated as a pawn in our neighbors' geopolitical games. As much as the goal of the presidential election is inclusion, de-escalation of violence and healing of societal divisions that have been created during the era of kleptocratic governments and aggravated by Russia's meddling, the goal of the sham poll, which is expected to take place in a few towns of Eastern Ukraine, is the exact opposite. The use of the word ""referendum"" to describe what was scheduled for May 11 is not just a misnomer, but an insult to the democratic act this term is meant to convey. I would suggest we all use a new term, putin-rendum, to avoid the confusion and call a spade a spade. As was the case in Crimea, the illegitimacy of the putin-rendum goes far beyond the absence of legal grounds for it. The objective of this sham poll is the root of the problem. A putin-rendum does not aspire to determine the will of the people. Its goal is to create another lie-based argument for Kremlin to spin. The world will surely be able to decipher the ploy, when they look at the data by Pew Research: ponder the hostage-taking of the OSCE international observers and other terrorist tactics used by the pro-Kremlin militants; and consider Saturday's incident where separatists in possession of 100,000 ballots already marked ""in favor of secession"" were captured. With the cynicism and duplicity of the May 7 statement, Mr. Putin has outdone himself. This was the window of opportunity to condemn the violence, in line with the commitment Kremlin made in Geneva, and at the very least, create an appearance of goodwill. Russia's president, however, chose to focus on a putin-rendum trying to legitimize this farce by reference. I hope no one will fall into this trap again validating a sham-poll by the use of Putin's terminology for it. May 25 is when all of Ukraine will exercise its basic democratic right, and I call on our friends in Russia and around the world to focus on a real vote, and not at today's circus."
2,TRAVEL,Exploring Incredible Istanbul,"Jamal Hammadi, ContributorCelebrity Hairstylist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exploring-istanbul_b_5302330.html,"My most recent exploits took me all the way to Istanbul and it was quite the adventure. Founded in 660 BC as Byzantium, in 330 AD it became Constantinople when it was overtaken by the Roman emperor Constantine.",2014-05-12,So many women transforming tradition in such a bright and charming way.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e110d2000004e00fe338d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"My most recent exploits took me all the way to Istanbul and it was quite the adventure. Founded in 660 BC as Byzantium, in 330 AD it became Constantinople when it was overtaken by the Roman emperor Constantine. Under that name it was the capital of four empires, most notably the Ottoman Empire from 1453 until 1922. In 1923 Turkey became a republic and soon after, in 1930, the city was officially renamed Istanbul. It sits strategically on one of the world's busiest waterways, the Bosphorus, which runs between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara, connecting the countries on the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, a very rich route for commerce. And it's on a scenic boat trip around the Bosphorus that I recommend starting any visit to Istanbul. Not only do you get a chance to view the often staggering architecture of the many mosques, castles and palaces, hotels and homes but you get a sense of the unique perspective of a city that straddles the European and Asian borders. After a wonderful excursion on the water, you'll have an enormous appetite and, of course, you'll want fresh fish. Luckily, there's a remarkable restaurant right in the marina for it called Vita Vita. The fish there is fabulous, I'd never seen anything like it. Another restaurant that I can't stop thinking about is Hamdi, located near the spice market and perfect after an afternoon spent there. When I was growing up my father was a chef in Beverly Hills and my mother made the best dolma I ever tasted so I'm a pretty tough judge and the dolma at Hamdi was stunning! Also, it's on the second floor and the views are so cool. The spice market was a real knockout, a true inspiration. My haircare line is 100 percent organic and chemical free; I am influenced by the sights and smells of nature. And, wow! I have never been so inspired. I want to create a whole new line of shampoo based around a tea that I found! The colors, the textures, the smells... it was truly invigorating. Not to mention how much I love to cook and the obscene abundance there is for that! Just go. It's not to be missed. It's at the southern end of the Galata Bridge, near the ferry docks. Another very cool site I explored was the Basilica Cistern. This underground cistern, built sometime between the third and fourth centuries, is capable of holding 2,800,00 cubic feet of water, though it holds only a tiny fraction of that now and that's really just to get an idea of it's prior use. Being inside of it is like being in a gigantic, creepy cathedral. It's lined with 336 marble columns, each one 30 feet tall. Strangely, two of the columns' bases are sculptures of Medusa's head, one turned on its side and one upside down. They are thought to have come from a late Roman building in the area and their peculiar positions are believed to reduce the power of her gaze.Being there in April was a special treat as there were tulips blanketing all the parks. The city spends enormous amounts of money every year on these beautiful flowers because it is said that the tulip is the letter of Allah and the plantings are like an offering to him. The brilliant colors and patterns they make are a marvelous sight to behold, no pictures could do it proper justice but the memories of walking on the lovely paths in the park surrounded by gorgeous blossoms will remain with me as a hallmark of my trip to Istanbul forever."

Her story is more somber than that of the young Italian nun, but her voice was no less mesmerizing.Born Jeanine Deckers in 1933, Soeur Sourire (or Sister Smile) was a Belgian Dominican nun who had a talent for singing and song writing. She began her musical career by playing for her fellow sisters at her convent in Waterloo, Belgium.Encouraged by her superiors, Deckers decided to record some of her songs with the Philips Recording Studio in 1961, and two years later her hit ""Dominique"" skyrocketed to the top of the U.S. Billboard charts. It remained at the top for four weeks and sold more than a million copies worldwide.Deckers became a celebrity almost overnight and would go on to appear via tape on the Ed Sullivan Show and see her life turned into a 1966 biopic starring Debbie Reynolds. Despite her success, Deckers actually made very little money on her hit record and was reportedly displeased with the film adaptation of her life. Deckers' musical career plummeted after her initial success, and her relationship with her superiors also deteriorated. She developed increasingly counter-Catholic sentiments and ultimately left her convent to attempt to open a school for autistic children.The retired Soeur Sourire tragically committed suicide in 1985 along with her partner of ten years, Annie Pécher. She had continued playing music until her death, though, even recording a disco version of her 1963 hit.Despite Deckers' suffering and tragic end, her beautiful voice lives on in the sweet ""Dominique"" that once captivated audiences around the world."
4,POLITICS,Democrats Struggle To Win Over Skeptical Americans On Obamacare,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-obamacare_n_5305878.html,,2014-05-11,"Senator Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, speaks during a press conference calling for the creation of an independent military justice system to deal with sexual harassment and assault in the military, in the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC on February 6, 2014.

The law, aiming to expand health insurance coverage to millions more Americans, has come under sustained attack from Republicans.The president has urged Democrats campaigning in the Nov. 4 congressional elections not to run away from ""Obamacare"", but instead to ""forcefully defend"" it. Obama has said that a surge in enrollment shows the system is running smoothly now, after its disastrous debut last October.New Hampshire, which is closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, is one of about 10 states where Republicans hope to make gains in order to pick up six seats they need to put the Democratic-led Senate under their control.Senators Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana have been among the Democratic targets of anti-Obamacare ads by conservative groups such as Americans for Prosperity.Republicans are counting on voter antipathy toward Obamacare to try to take charge of the Senate and expand their majority in the House of Representatives. But while Obamacare may now be working better, national polls clearly show more people disapprove than approve of the law. HOPING FAMILIARITY BREEDS SUPPORTIn New Hampshire, Shaheen and Representative Carol Shea-Porter, a fellow Democrat, were among the earliest advocates of the healthcare law. The state's other Democratic Representative, Ann Kuster, was elected after the law passed, but also backs it.Shaheen said in an interview she shared Obama's view that as Americans get to know Obamacare, they are embracing it. Shaheen said there was ""a lot of misinformation"" about the law. ""The reality is, it's beginning to work for people,"" she said.But 51 percent of New Hampshire adults oppose Obamacare while just 37 percent support it, the University of New Hampshire Survey Center reported last month in a WMUR-Granite State poll. Sixty-one percent of the state's voters think medical costs will increase under the act.""The perception is, 'it will hurt my family and costs will go up',"" said Andrew Smith, director of the center. ""In a political campaign, that is a big boulder to push uphill.""Skeptics include people like Derek Gagnon, a 33-year-old auto mechanic who says he would not even consider voting for anyone who had backed the Affordable Care Act.He has no health insurance, but he also says he has no intention of signing up for the private insurance offered through the government-run website, HealthCare.gov.""I shouldn't be forced to do something like that in a free country,"" said Gagnon, referring to the law's requirement, known as the ""individual mandate,"" that almost all legal U.S. residents buy health insurance or pay a fine.""I'll pay the fine this year and next year,"" Gagnon said at a frozen yogurt store outside New Hampshire's state capital, Concord. ""Maybe I won't have to pay it the third year, because by then Obama will be out of office.""Gagnon's distaste for the individual mandate dovetails with a principal line of conservative attacks nationally on the law.Obamacare is meant to extend subsidized health coverage to millions of uninsured Americans through new online private insurance markets and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor. But conservative critics portray it as a government intrusion in a major sector of the economy that will hurt job growth and erode freedoms.Shaheen's leading Republican opponent in the Senate race, Scott Brown, is betting that theme will resonate in New Hampshire, where the state's famous motto is ""Live Free or Die.""In April, Brown kicked off his candidacy with the declaration that New Hampshire could ""Live Free or Log On"" - a caustic reference to signing up online for Obamacare.Lately, he has been traveling the state on an ""Obamacare Isn't Working"" tour. Brown, a former senator from neighboring Massachusetts, says the act should be completely repealed and the issue of healthcare reform should be left to the states.Brown has been rising in the polls against Shaheen. But she was ahead 45 to 39 percent in a recent WMUR-Granite State poll. MORE THAN HEALTHCARE AT STAKEDean Spiliotes, a New Hampshire political analyst, said Shaheen, a former New Hampshire governor, still had political capital in the state, and he doubted the healthcare issue alone could defeat her.""People view her as not an ideologue. That has helped her with voters,"" said Spiliotes, a political science professor at Southern New Hampshire University. ""If Obamacare rises to the level of taking out Jeanne Shaheen, there is something larger going on.""To be sure, Obamacare faces unique challenges in New Hampshire. Just one insurance company in the small state offered insurance policies through the program this year, and the insurer doesn't cover healthcare in 10 of the state's 26 hospitals, deficits Shaheen and Shea-Porter have been working to fix.Spiliotes said New Hampshire Democrats are defending Obamacare ""but they are kind of doing it in fits and starts. It's not a uniform, rah-rah kind of support.""In one hopeful sign for Democrats, enrollment in Obamacare in the state of 1.3 million people has reached 40,000 - double the number that had been expected.Shea-Porter, a former social worker who came to Congress in 2006 campaigning on healthcare reform, said she would never run away from healthcare reform, even though she has been critical of its implementation.""In my mind, this was a great joy and a triumph to be able to vote for healthcare for millions of Americans who had none,"" she said. ""I am always going to support it.""That said, she understands the political perils for Democrats of Obamacare. She lost her seat in Congress in 2010 elections after her vote for the law, only to be re-elected in 2012. Her 2014 race is considered a toss-up although her Republican opponent has yet to be chosen in a September primary.Shea-Porter, who met last week with recent healthcare enrollees in Somersworth, said she is aware of the qualms some people have, including wariness of providing personal information on a government website.But she said the best way to advertise Obamacare's benefits is to publicize the stories of people who signed up and discovered that ""nothing terrible happened.""Patrice Glynn, 54-year-old New Hampshire resident, is already convinced. Glynn, a diabetic, lived without health insurance for nine months after she lost her job and before she signed up on HealthCare.gov. ""If it was so bad, would 40,000 people be on it?"" she asked.

You may find your ideal spot... or you may not. And that's OK, too. Perhaps you'll learn of other communities that may suit you better.In any case, we're talking about some travel here. And as we all know, travel can be exhilarating. But like any kind of ""ex,"" it can also be expensive, exhausting, and extremely frustrating. So here are some tips to help reduce the stress and increase your enjoyment of travel:  Barter at the local markets to get the best deals. Photo courtesy Hugo Ghiara, InternationalLiving.comPack light. There is absolutely no reason to drag a big suitcase along with a wardrobe for every day that you'll be gone. Also, you might be surprised that the hotel or apartment building where you'll be staying may not have an elevator... or staff to help you carry your things up three flights of stairs. Things like shampoo and shaving cream can be purchased when you get there, and besides, this will help you learn about the local products available to you. And outside the U.S. you'll typically find laundry facilities extremely affordable. Tip: Don't ask the hotel to do your laundry. Instead, ask them to point you to a nearby laundry. (In a Spanish-speaking country it's called a lavanderia.) Chances are you'll find someone who will cheerfully wash, dry and fold your clothes for $3 to $4 a load. But word to the wise: don't take anything that needs dry cleaning or isn't durable.Pack the right stuff. If we were going on a trip for two weeks or longer, here's what we'd pack. Her: one pair of nice slacks, one skirt, pair of leggings, 4 blouses or T-shirts, a scarf that doubles as a wrap, one pair of comfortable shoes, and if we're going somewhere warm (and we rarely go where it is not): a pair of shorts or sundress, bathing suit and flip flops. Him: two pairs of slacks, two long sleeve shirts, two polo shirts, two T-shirts, ball cap, swim trunks, and flip-flops. We both pack about five pairs of undies and we wear our bulkiest clothes on the plane... typically jeans, long-sleeve shirt and jacket, our favorite comfortable walking shoes, and our favorite Panama hats. We both have very small, easy-to-pack cosmetic kits that include very little to no liquids.Tip: You must have a hat, sunscreen, and insect repellant if you are going to the low-lying tropics. We prefer the easy-to-pack ""wipes."" However, insect wipes are not allowed through security in the U.S as they are ""toxic chemicals."" (But corkscrews are allowed. Go figure.) Play it safe and put these in your checked luggage. And if you take any prescription medications, take an adequate supply. No matter what you've been led to believe, you may not be able to purchase the exact same prescription overseas.Pack snacks. There is nothing worse than being stuck in an airport or, even worse, on a long flight without anything healthy to nibble on. Throw some granola bars or peanuts in your carry-on bag. You'll be glad you did. What else to pack in your carry-on? Your personal electronics. Never ever pack these in your checked luggage unless you are 100 percent OK with losing them. And throw in a small pack of tissues, too, and one of those tiny bottles of cleanser gel. Always handy. And what not to pack? Jewelry. There's no reason to drag expensive jewelry around with you. Wearing it just draws attention. If you must, take the costume stuff; in the same vein, don't carry big wads of cash or traveler's checks. Those are rarely used anymore and it will be difficult to find anyone who accepts them. The truth is that most of the world outside the U.S. runs on cash. So take enough (maybe $300 or so and in small $20 denominations with 20 or so dollar bills) to get you through the first few days and then find a reliable ATM machine. Know your PIN numbers. We carry two debit cards from separate banks for the rare occasion that one is not accepted.Tip: Now may be the time to switch to a bank that offers no foreign ATM transaction fees. We love Capital One for that reason. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. This is great advice whether you are traveling or on the ground exploring. Once you are through security, buy a bottle of water to take with you on the plane. And always stock-up if you're going on a long car or bus trip or a long walk. Dehydration is not your friend. Tip: If you get sick while traveling, grab some Gatorade, Pedialyte, or something of that nature to quickly replenish your electrolytes. As for drinks with ice and eating salads at restaurants in Latin America, look for places that appear to be clean and have lots of customers. In 25 years of traveling, we've each only been sick once (at separate times despite eating the same thing) from anything foodborne. And we eat out a lot.Have a way to communicate. We admit that we fail in this regard. We do not have a phone with a service plan that allows us to communicate inexpensively from anywhere in the world. But if and when we do find the perfect service, we'll sign up. Instead, we rely on location-specific phones and SIM cards. The only time this system failed us was recently when our flights were delayed and we were forced to run through the Bogotá airport to catch a connection. There was no way to call the driver waiting for us in Ecuador. Luckily, he was still waiting when we arrived at 1:30 a.m.Tip: We've all heard the horror stories about taking taxis in foreign countries. While you do need to exercise caution, many countries have put safeguards in place to ensure passenger safety. At nearly every airport in the world, for example, you'll find sanctioned taxi stands with safe, reliable drivers. Always make sure you have the address and telephone number of your hotel or accommodation written down. Drivers won't always know where these places are just by name.Always ask for the discount. In most of the world, negotiating is expected. So when you make hotel reservations or barter with a private driver or, especially, when making a purchase in an artisan mercado, put on your haggle hat. Even in some stores you can get a discount if you ask, as the marked price is often the ""credit card price."" Pay with cash and save. Be prepared to walk away if you don't agree with the price offered. You'd be surprised at how quickly that will sway the negotiations in your favor. By the way, if you walk into a hotel and inquire about the rates, ask to see a room. Test the hot water, pull the blankets back, and look at the linens. Tip: We use TripAdvisor and other venues to check out reviews of hotels, restaurants, etc. You'll get good advice from fellow travelers. Still, always ask for a room that's away from street noise. That doesn't mean your room won't border a disco, a neighbor with roosters, or a church with loud bells that ring all night long. Don't pay too far in advance. Stay just a couple of nights before you commit to a longer stay. Two great noise-reduction strategies: ear plugs and noise machines. If you have an iPod, download an app for that. If you travel with a computer and have Internet in your room (which most hotels have these days), you'll find one here for free.What about travel insurance? If you're concerned that you may have to cancel or postpone your trip, then buying travel insurance is a wise move. You'll often be offered that option when you book your travel. Just be sure to read the fine print so you understand what's covered and what isn't. Know that your health insurance plan at home may not cover you while traveling overseas.

8,RELIGION,Jerusalem Churches Take On Hate Graffiti,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jerusalem-churches-hate-graffiti_n_5296499.html,,2014-05-11,"A catholic priest looks at anti-Christian graffiti written in Hebrew "" at the Latrun Trappist Monastery where Israeli police say vandals overnight have spray-painted anti-Christian and pro-settler graffiti and set the monastery's door on fire, in Latrun, between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Israel, Tuesday, Sept 4, 2012. Suspicion fell on Jewish settlers and their supporters who retaliate against anti-settlement measures, generally by attacking Palestinian property, but also by vandalizing Christian sites and Israeli military facilities. Earlier this week, the government ordered settlers out of two unauthorized enclaves in the West Bank. Some of the graffiti referred to unauthorized settler outposts and one read, ""Jesus is a monkey.""

Four days earlier, a Catholic official discovered that the words “Death to Arabs, Christians and all those who hate Israel” had been spray-painted in Hebrew on a column in front of the Office of the Assembly of Bishops at Jerusalem’s Notre Dame Center. The words were topped by a Star of David.“Mere coincidence?” the website asks.“We do not doubt the willingness of the State of Israel to finish with these acts which don’t serve the image of Israel,” said Auxiliary Bishop William Shomali of the Latin Patriarchate in Jerusalem. “But efforts failed and acts of vandalism continue increasing.”On Thursday, a Vatican office that maintains all Catholic Church property here, asked Israeli authorities to “work urgently against extremist elements” to ensure peace and safeguard Christian holy places.Police officials say they are doing what they can to prevent these attacks, something church officials dispute.“A new strategy is needed,” said Shomali. “Let us not forget that the kind of education received by these people prepares them to do similar acts. We have to improve the educational side if we want to avoid the repetition of such acts on the long-term period.”During a visit to a mosque in the Arab village of Fureidis on May 1, Israeli Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch called the recent attacks “hate crimes” and vowed to make arrests in the coming days.On Sunday night, 40 organizations, including many Jewish ones, will hold a protest against the vandalism."
