0,ARTS & CULTURE,What Breaking Up On ‘The Bachelorette’ Reveals About Toxic Masculinity,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do-on-the-bachelorette_us_559c08d5e4b05d7587e23d1d,The way we raise boys makes having relationships with men difficult -- and scary.,2015-07-07,"<p>Joe and Kaitlyn, in happier times (I think).</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559c0e9e1b00005e006aff53.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Breaking up is just the worst.Watching other people break up, on the other hand, holds a fascination for many, tinged with schadenfreude. Reality TV is a case in point: We can say we watch ""The Bachelor"" or ""The Bachelorette"" for the true love story, but proportionally there are a whole lot more breakup stories; for every proposal, there are, typically, 24 breakups aired. Twenty-four weeping women slinking to the limo, 24 sulking men storming off camera.“Why am I never good enough for love?” a 23-year-old dental hygienist moans, her sobs shaking the wilting curls in her bottle-blond hair. “She’s really missing out,” blusters a 29-year-old fitness trainer, seething over his public rejection. “I have a ton to offer.” Sitting at home, we snort into our Pinot at these outsized, irrational reactions. Obviously the Bachelor or Bachelorette can’t marry ALL of the contestants -- why can’t the rejects leave gracefully?When it comes to breaking up, though, we’re all set up to fail. Breaking up gracefully, or being broken up with gracefully, isn’t a skill that’s usually taught, nor is it one that our culture seems to treat with particular regard, aside from a few rom-com third wheels who generously step aside for the real hero.Instead, we’re left to muddle through our breakups, flailing around our first big heartbreak, trying to argue our soon-to-be-ex out of the breakup or posting passive-aggressive Facebook statuses about the lost beloved. When we’re dumping, we try out ghosting, using thin lies (""I’m just really busy right now""), or brutal honesty (""you’ve gained weight and it kind of grosses me out""). Aziz Ansari’s recent book Modern Romance points out that there’s no real consensus on which tactic is best for ending things, and we often don’t even use the tactic we would want others to use to break up with us. It’s a general disaster.Our socialization, of course, tends to affect how this disaster goes, as ""The Bachelor"" franchise comically demonstrates. Women, taught to fret, cry and cling and ask what we did wrong. Men, taught to toughen up, get angry and even a bit threatening -- or demonstrate their toughness through a studied act of carelessness, ending things with a barb about how little they cared the whole time. These reactions are far from universal, but ""The Bachelor"" reveals how rigorously men and women are socialized to handle rejection in diametrically opposed ways, neither of them very healthy.On ""The Bachelorette,"" of course, the star is media-trained and prepped. She sits down with each reject, at least later in the season, and gently tells him that she thinks he’s just wonderful, but their relationship wasn’t progressing quickly enough, or they didn’t have that spark. It’s honest, but not brutal. It’s on the other side that things tend to get ugly. Even the best of breakups are unpleasant for the rejected one. They’re embarrassing, because we’re taught that our romantic desirability, in any context, is an indicator of our worth. Pretty much every piece of pop culture makes sure to give the identifiable hero or heroine a desirable romantic conquest, even if the protagonist isn’t traditionally sexy; we consume the message that the inherent worth of the protagonist earns them romantic love. Love isn’t a game of finding the right match in a population of billions; it’s a game of being the best, most lovable one. Being dumped means you’ve lost that game. You were the buffoonish third wheel in the rom-com of someone else’s life.Of course, none of this excuses dreadful breakup etiquette, but not everyone can, as Jared did Monday night on ""The Bachelorette,"" rise above our socialized behaviors and courteously accept a partner’s reasons for ending a relationship. (He even saved his pain and tears for the limo rather than make Kaitlyn feel worse! What a champ.) In the lowest moments, many turn to the deeply ingrained responses that bubble up immediately.  Most of us, if pressed to recall the most embarrassing lows in our lives, would probably think back to awful breakups. The end of first love, especially, can bring out some shocking behavior in immature dumpees. We poured bleach on our now-ex’s favorite old camp T-shirt, or we called sobbing five times a night for a week. We got pissed and told them they were never good enough for us anyway.For men on ""The Bachelorette,"" all too often, the immediate response is chilling anger. Again and again this season -- with Tony’s and Ian’s exits, as well as Joe’s goodbye on the most recent episode -- men on the show have responded to rejection and disappointment not with grace, but with rage and even cruelty.Once might be a fluke. Three times is a trend. But does that surprise anyone? While women are socialized to turn their disappointment and hurt inward, as evidenced by the crying bachelorettes leaving the mansion wondering what they did wrong, men are often socialized to turn it into anger -- anger directed outward. Though the aggression has been limited to some nasty words, clenched jaws and cold stares -- there are, anyway, cameras everywhere -- Kaitlyn has clearly felt the fury in the atmosphere. She’s constantly asking the men if they’re upset with her, and the answer is often “Yes,” even if they say “No,” as they stalk off.Watching these tense conversations, between tiny, bird-like Kaitlyn and the hulking men she’s dating, the mind drifts to that old saw, attributed to Margaret Atwood: “Men are afraid women will laugh at them; women are afraid men will kill them.” The worst the Bachelor ever has to fear is a particularly hysterical woman causing him a few uncomfortable minutes during a breakup. For the Bachelorette, however well-protected and -observed she may be, there’s still a submerged terror of actual violence from her rejected suitors, whose disappointment so quickly metastasizes into wrath.Of course, none of these men would hurt Kaitlyn. Their clenched-jaw, contemptuous departures are just the sanitized, reality TV evidence of a cultural sickness, the kind of male socialization that makes women afraid to tell a man on the street to stop harassing her because he might stab her, afraid to refuse to give out her number because he might shoot her. Our society still teaches young men to get mad and get even, and until we find a better way for them to process pain and hurt, it’s going to be a scary world for women.Even on ""The Bachelorette,"" the supposedly empowering sister of ""The Bachelor,"" we can’t escape reminders of that reality."
1,SPORTS,NBA Union Likely To Soon Start Paying Ex-Players’ Health Care Costs,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nba-health-care-retired-players_us_559c5252e4b042b0befa2aaf,A great move by the union to help struggling former players.,2015-07-07,<p>Michele Roberts was reportedly moved to act after hearing stories of former NBA players not being able to afford health insurance. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559c55051b00009e0091c84d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tired of hearing stories of former players not being able to afford medical care, National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts and the union’s executives are readying a proposal for the league's player representatives that would pay for retired NBA players’ health care costs.NBPA director of communications Tara Greco confirmed to The Huffington Post that the proposal will be discussed at a July 20 membership meeting but could not comment the likelihood of it being adopted. But league sources have told Yahoo’s Adrian Wojnarowski that the plan is expected to pass through “with ease.”The plan will reportedly cost up to $15 million per year and come out of the gobs of money that the league and players will start to pull in as a result of a highly lucrative television deal beginning in the 2016-17 NBA season. The NBPA has already begun the process of tracking down former players who will benefit from the plan.“This is what a union should do -- help take care of its members, past and present,” NBC Sports’ Kurt Helin wrote of the proposal. “These are the guys who helped build the foundation that the very lucrative NBA was built upon.”Sports Illustrated shocked the sports world in 2009 when it estimated that roughly 60 percent of NBA players face financial stress within just five years of retiring from the league. Since then, a number of efforts have sprouted up to help the former players, including a partnership with a group of doctors who provide free care to some athletes and the imposition of a plan meant to force NBA players to save for retirement.Stories of beloved players -- including Hall of Famer Earl Monroe -- struggling to afford health insurance in post-NBA life have popped up numerous times in recent years. But Deadspin’s Kevin Draper wonders whether this relatively small gesture is also a political move meant to engender sympathy for the players ahead of upcoming labor negotiations, which some fear might lead to a lockout or strike.Of course, there's also the possibility it could be both a cynical ploy and a genuinely sympathetic gesture. After all, all players will be former players someday."
2,TASTE,Arby's Launches Support Line For Vegetarians Tempted By Its New Bacon,Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arbys-launches-support-line-for-vegetarians-tempted-by-bacon_us_559c3effe4b0759e2b5123c1,"On June 28, Arby's restaurants across the country began selling three sandwiches featuring bacon baked with brown sugar",2015-07-07,"<p>The Arby's restaurant is seen in Chantilly, Virginia on January 2, 2015. (PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images)</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559c408b1a000080003caeeb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On June 28, Arby's restaurants across the country began selling three sandwiches featuring bacon baked with brown sugar. The brown sugar bacon will only be available until the end of July, but in the months leading up to its launch, Arby's executives became concerned about its potential effect on one segment of the population: vegetarians. The worry stemmed from a conversation at the company's Atlanta headquarters about six months ago, in which Arby's employee Ellen Rose, who works on the company's field marketing team and is a vegetarian, joked that the bacon looked so good that it might tempt her away from her meatless diet.""For the people who love Arby's and the people who love meat, this is going to be a really good month, and for the people who don't, it's going to be a trying month,"" Rob Lynch, the company's chief marketing officer, told The Huffington Post.Lynch said that the marketing team felt that it was their ""corporate responsibility"" to prevent vegetarians from abandoning their beliefs. So they came up with the idea of launching a tongue-in-cheek ""support line"" for vegetarians tempted by the brown sugar bacon. The automated hotline went live on Tuesday morning; you can reach it by calling 1-855-MEAT-HLP. When you call in, you're instructed to press one ""if you're a vegetarian who's feeling tempted by brown sugar bacon and you can't stop thinking about that sweet meat"" or to press two ""if you're a vegetarian who's given in and eaten brown sugar bacon."" You then hear a supportive message that corresponds to your situation. (Though the message for vegetarians who have not yet ""given in"" does end with an instruction to ""go make a salad"" in a decidedly unsupportive tone.) Lynch said that since the hotline launched, so many people have called in that the company found it impossible to keep count. There's a good chance, though, that many of the callers were not, in fact, vegetarians -- because this hotline represents one of the few offerings Arby's has made to that constituency. The only foods on the chain's menu that contain no meat are sides and beverages. When asked to recommend an Arby's order for a vegetarian who refuses to try the brown sugar bacon, Lynch mentioned salads before pausing and suggesting another idea. ""Frankly, the BLT is a vegetarian option if you just take off the B,"" he said, referring to the bacon. ""I just thought of that right now."""

5,HEALTHY LIVING,What Deadlines Are Doing To Your Creativity,Leigh Weingus,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deadlines-and-creativity_us_559bfaa4e4b0759e2b510018,"Deadlines have their advantages, but creativity may not be one of them.",2015-07-07,"<p>Deadlines may be good for productivity, but creativity is another story. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559c275e2100002f00290ae7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Got a big deadline coming up on a creative project? You may be in trouble, according to one neuroscientist.  In an interview with The Washington Post, John Kounios of Drexel University said that working under a strict deadline can put a damper on creativity -- probably because the pressure puts you in an anxious and not-so-good mood. “When you’re in a positive mood, you’re more sensitive to picking up these weakly activated, unconscious ideas and, when it’s detected, your attention can switch to it, and it can pop into the head as an insight,” Kounios explained. “If you’re in a bad mood … it just goes with what’s strongest, which is usually the most straightforward.”Kounios isn't the first to take a look at how deadlines impact out-of-the-box thinking. Teresa Amiable, a researcher at Harvard Business School, said back in 2002 that putting too much pressure on employees on a daily basis can lead to burnout. ""Very high levels of time pressure should be avoided if you want to foster creativity on a consistent basis,"" she explained in a Harvard Business Week article. ""However, if a time crunch is absolutely unavoidable, managers can try to preserve creativity by protecting people from fragmentation of their work and distractions; they should also give people a sense of being 'on a mission,' doing something difficult but important. I don't think, though, that most people can function effectively in that mode for long periods of time without getting burned out.”Before you ditch your obligations in the name of creativity, it's important to note that working under a deadlines does have its advantages.  Justin Rosenstein, the designer for Facebook's internal productivity tool, is all about committing to deadlines on projects. ""If an important task doesn't have a natural deadline, I'll tell people confidently, 'I will send you a copy by end of day Friday,'"" he wrote in a blog for The Huffington Post. ""Now I don't want to look ridiculous in front of my teammates, so I will naturally make damn sure it's ready for them by Friday.""We're all about productivity. Just make sure it's not getting in the way of your creativity.  H/T Science Of Us"

While posts regarding health and weight loss peak at the new year and drop off in March, the online fitness fire ignites again in June as everyone looks forward to spend increasing amounts of time outdoors -- typically in more revealing clothing. These sunny summer months prompt us to prioritize our health, and it turns out Twitter can help us do so.To see if there was a connection between tweeting about weight loss and actually losing weight, in 2013 Turner-McGrievy and her colleagues studied 96 overweight and obese people who were interested in losing weight and used Twitter as one of their social networks. What they found was pretty remarkable: For every 10 tweets about weight loss, the study's participants lost an average of about a pound within a six month period, Turner-McGrievy said. ""I think there's that accountability -- that's a lot of what group support provides,"" she said. ""It also is something that keeps weight loss at the forefront of your mind. And we chose Twitter because of how in the moment it is -- it allows you to have instant support when, for example, you go to a new restaurant and don't know what to order.""As folks take to Twitter to talk about their latest fitness activities, some workouts are noticeably more popular than others:This word cloud, based on data from Twitter's list of the top 15 fitness activities discussed by their users, reveals that running and jogging (in the largest typeface) consistently hold the top spot as the most-tweeted-about workouts. Yoga took second place, followed by spinning and cycling in third place. Aerobics and circuit training (displayed in the smallest fonts) rounded out the bottom of the list. The new Twitter statistics also revealed that the time of day at which people most commonly exercise fluctuates depending on their locations. On the west coast, users in San Francisco and Los Angeles typically log their sweat sessions between 6 and 7 a.m., while those in Dallas and Chicago finish their days with exercise between 8 and 9 p.m.. The majority of New Yorkers squeeze it in between 4 and 5 p.m. When it comes to the day of the week that people are most excited and vocal about getting their sweat on, Tuesday surprisingly came out on top, especially in January and February, followed by Wednesday and Monday. Courtesy of GiphyThe consensus seems to be that few people are excited to work out on the weekends, despite the fact that it's when we have the most down time to enjoy such things. January, unsurprisingly, was the month with the highest fitness-based tweeting, according to another study conducted by Turner-McGrievy in 2014. And many Twitter users maintained that momentum through February and March.Courtesy of GiphySo if you're looking for an extra boost of motivation and support to achieve your fitness goals -- whether it be toning a little for those summer shorts, training for your next race, or striving for a heart-healthy body fat percentage -- don't underestimate the ability of social media in helping you get there. Those tweets can be a pretty powerful thing.  Follow Us On Pinterest |  Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter"
12,HEALTHY LIVING,How Your Post-Workout Beer Affects Muscle Growth,"Life by Daily Burn , ContributorHealth and fitness articles to help you live a healthier, happ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beer-after-workout_b_7696806.html,"Beer lovers, rest easy. Though more research is needed, there is currently no evidence to suggest a post-workout beer or two can cause long-term harm.",2015-07-07,2015-06-30-1435676772-7127322-PostWorkoutBeer21.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-30-1435676772-7127322-PostWorkoutBeer21-thumb.jpg," Photo: Pond5By Kamal Patel for Life by DailyBurnKamal Patel is the director of Examine.com, and is a nutrition researcher with an MPH and MBA from Johns Hopkins University on hiatus from a Ph.D. in nutrition. He has published peer-reviewed articles on vitamin D and calcium as well as a variety of clinical research topics.Even the most dedicated athletes need time off to unwind. While partying usually results in nothing worse than a hangover, you may have also noticed that your Monday morning gym session feels harder after a weekend of indulging. While many people extol the virtues of the post-workout beer, it can be difficult to determine what effect alcohol actually has on muscles.Some research shows that alcohol can impact your rate of muscle protein synthesis -- the process by which muscles grow and repair. But could a post-workout drink (or two) really undo the effects of your reps and sets -- or will it take way more than that to truly set you back? Read on to find out.Breaking Down the Post-Workout BeerBeer, like many sports drinks, contains carbohydrates and electrolytes. But does that mean it could replace a Gatorade? Not so fast.Two relevant studies published on this topic compared liver protein synthesis rates -- the detoxifying enzymes produced by the liver -- among people consuming various quantities of alcohol. Scientists found that the rate of synthesis changed based on the amount of alcohol ingested. Protein synthesis was suppressed by 24 percent after people consumed 71 grams of pure alcohol, or approximately five beers. However, it was not suppressed after people consumed just 28 grams of alcohol, the amount found in about two standard beers.The most relevant human study to date found that for a 150-pound person, consuming the equivalent of about seven beers resulted in suppressed muscle protein synthesis. This occurred even if the alcohol was consumed after 25 grams of protein (see what 25 grams of protein looks like here). In other words, your post-happy hour munchies won't help. Animal studies also provide supporting evidence; muscular protein synthesis rates in rats were suppressed after they received ethanol injections.Overall, this evidence suggests drinking upwards of five beers in one sitting could impair workout recovery and muscle growth. There are no studies specifically investigating the impact of a single beer post-workout. But those who love a good post-gym drink will be happy to know evidence suggests drinking about two of your favorite brews won't undo your hard work at the gym.Alcohol and TestosteroneTestosterone is also important when it comes to building muscle -- the more you naturally have, the easier it is to see gains. Low doses of alcohol (about two beers for a 150-pound person) have been shown to increase circulating testosterone by about 17 percent in both young men and premenopausal women. Unfortunately, this boost in testosterone is probably not enough to noticeably increase muscle growth.On the other hand, heavier drinking (think: seven beers for a 150-pound individual) has been found to suppress testosterone. Furthermore, even moderate amounts of booze (about three to four beers) have been shown to mildly suppress testosterone when ingested daily for at least three weeks. And that could be enough to undo some of your efforts in the weight room.The Big PictureBeer lovers, rest easy. Though more research is needed, there is currently no evidence to suggest a post-workout beer or two can cause long-term harm. If a tall one is your go-to treat after a hard workout, you don't need to worry about your testosterone levels or protein synthesis rates. Just make sure your one-beer reward doesn't turn into a five-beer habit.More from Life by DailyBurn:How Bad Is Booze, Really? 6 Crazy Facts About Drinking AlcoholIs It Better to Do Cardio or Strength Training First?19 Reasons to Work Out (Beyond the Perfect Body)Also on HuffPost:"

In this interview with Professor Lee White, Director of Gabon's National Parks, it's easy to feel the frustration he and his team of dedicated conservationists -- turned soldiers -- are feeling towards the recent surge in elephant poaching, as they valiantly try to defend their African forest elephants from the battle hardened and heavily armed poachers who've set their sights on the West African country of Gabon.With a population of just one and a half million people, this peaceful nation has become the focus of an intense conservation battle, as surging prices for ivory and a sharp decline in elephant populations -- due to poaching in neighbouring countries - has led to the establishment of highly-organised and sophisticated networks of illegal wildlife trafficking, which are being attracted to the hardened pink ivory of Gabon's forest elephants.As indigenous pygmies and children get caught up in this vacuum of illicit trade and the standoff between poachers and rangers becomes increasingly volatile, human fatalities are becoming the norm as the true cost of this souring demand begins to take its toll.Yet, despite recent moves by both the Gabonese and Chinese governments to destroy stockpiles of seized ivory, the future of the African forest elephant will ultimately come down to our ability to alert an increasingly affluent Chinese middle class to the true cost of acquiring ivory and the fallacy of its use within Chinese medicine. Not to mention tackling the unscrupulous traders who, sensing a business opportunity, are seeking to stockpile ivory in anticipation of the elephants extinction.Failing this, Mr. White and his team will continue to be the last stand as they find themselves left on the frontline, passionately defending these magnificent and defenseless animals.In this series of interviews Jungle Bird speaks to the people and organisations who are protecting forests and the biodiversity within.To be notified of further interviews, please subscribe above."

There's Amy Duffey, for example, owner of the Bar Method in midtown, who led an all-female class of 24 -- and yours truly -- through everything, and anything imaginable, on a ballet barre, from leg stretches to backstretches, balancing weights in precarious positions, squeezing balls between my legs, and squatting again and again and again and again and again. Afterwards, I was as sore as when I played football as a middle school tailback. As Amy says ""the (Bar Method) exercises go deep into the muscle and stay there, by isometrics. You are literally sitting on the muscle, which makes you feel the burn."" Then there is Soul Cycle's Madeleine Starkey, Twitter name @madstark  (I kid you not!) who never lets up, for one second, as she led me and a roomful of others through Madeleine Madness. Mad Stark keep looking over at me with the most sinister smile ever, with rivers of sweat poring out of my body as I was engulfed by the most powerful bass beat that I've ever felt against my chest -- boom, boom, boom. Mad Stark is no joke.And then there is Sylwia Wiesenberg, and her Tonique Method. If the Spanish Inquisition had known about this technique of physical torture, they would have used it instead of the rack. I'm not shitting (which I had no time to do) as Sylwia broke me down, literally, in her TWO-hour class. The Tonique Method is like nothing that I've ever seen, or done before. It is a unique toning class (yep, that's why it's called Tonique!) that is a physical psycho-motion blur of dance, martial arts, Brazilian Capoeira, yoga, Crossfit, and non-stop Eastern bloc, sadistic-tinged repetition cycles of squats, push-ups, situps, and planks. If you have any doubt that Tonique is not the hardest workout in America, then try to follow along with just one eight-minute segment on your computer or smartphone here and then imagine doing FOURTEEN more eight-minute segments! So far, I have only had the balls to go once to Sylwia's class. But as hard as Tonique is, the workout can make your body harder than any other workout, anywhere. Sylwia herself is walking proof of that, as shown in her Instagram account. She has the most fit body that I have ever seen in real life. But here's the thing. When you are doing her workout, it is only a matter of time -- I'd say 30 minutes tops -- before the visual wonders of her tight butt, and tighter abs, completely wears off and all you do is hold on for dear life in hopes that you can walk again, and not end up with electric paddles on your chest after your heart gives out. Here's the good news. Sylwia is finally taking the Tonique Method to the masses. To do that, she is developing simpler, and yes easier classes (Thank God!) for beginners, intermediates, and advanced, climbing to the highest peak of physical exertion/exhaustion when you become ""Toniqued"" (her current two hour madness workout). Mark my words. Tonique is going to take this country by storm in the next 24 months, and soon you will be hearing folks bragging that they got ""Toniqued."" The best thing about Tonique is you can do it at home, with no equipment, on your home computer, tablet or smartphone. Even better, especially for us Tonique Tadpoles, the workout puts little to no stress on your joints or ligaments. As Sylwia says, ""Tonique is Minimal wear, Maximum Life.""Next week, I plan on taking the deep dive, and getting ""Toniqued"" by Sylwia, again. And when I do, she's going to again kick my ass while I grin, then grimace, through the pain as she converts me into a stronger, better, and much more humbled man.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Photo: https://www.lsa.umich.edu/pcap/gallery/14thannualexhibition2009  This art show is hosted by the Prison Creative Arts Project (PCAP) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. It was through the Prison Creative Arts Project that I first heard the term mass incarceration. In 2003, I enrolled in English 319: Theatre and Social Change, which was a PCAP prerequisite course taught by Buzz Alexander, professor and co-founder of the Prison Creative Arts Project. This course trained students to facilitate theatre workshops that enabled participants to imagine and shape their own plays in prisons, juvenile detention centers and high schools. We studied theoretical frameworks such as Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Freire and Theatre of the Oppressed by Augusto Boal; read about the devastating impact of the school-to-prison pipeline and zero tolerance policies; and learned how excessively and discriminately our country has been locking people up for decades. Through PCAP, I met committed, long-time activists such as Emily Harris, Jesse Jannetta and Mary Heinen. As the conversation about ending mass incarceration has spread to mainstream media outlets, I find myself wanting to hear from them and people directly impacted by mass incarceration. There is no doubt we have come a long way in shifting our national, collective consciousness around this issue. But is the national conversation regarding criminal justice reform moving in the right direction?   Emily Harris speaking at the 20th Annual Exhibition of Art by Michigan Prisoners. There is a national and bipartisan consensus that criminal justice reform needs to happen. In April, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made a speech about criminal justice reform at Columbia University that called for ""an end to the era of mass incarceration."" Emily Harris, advisory board member of the Prison Creative Arts Project and field director at the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights in Oakland, says,It is important that we have been able to create a political environment where Hillary Clinton can come forward and name how detrimental mass incarceration has been on our country and have that be a viable, political move as she is running for president. That our understanding of mass incarceration is shifting and the targeting of communities is so visible now . . . Clinton, and people like her, can no longer not take a position on that issue. The political will for criminal justice reform is here, but is the kind of reform being talked about enough to drastically reduce our prison population?What the conversation must be addressing  Ending mass incarceration will require envisioning a world beyond prisons and organizing/planning effectively to get us there. Decarceration is a necessary piece in this process. Jesse Jannetta, advisory board member of the Prison Creative Arts Project and senior research associate at the Urban Institute in D.C., says, ""If we want to decarcerate at the most basic level, there are two ways to do it: send fewer people to prison and/or don't keep people in prison as long. Everything that you would do to seriously reduce the prison population is in one or both of those options; it's as straightforward as that."" Of late, the national conversation around reducing lengthy sentences has been focused primarily on low-level offenders for non-violent and/or drug related offenses. Harris and Jannetta both agree this is not enough to make a significant dent in our current prison population. Jannetta comments,Right now, a lot of the conversation about reducing mass incarceration in public is focused on low-level and non-violent drug offenders. That is around 15 percent of the prison population nationwide. Let those people out tomorrow and the prison population will still be 85 percent of what it was. You can't cut the prison population in half by just talking about low-level drug offenders. You have to talk about violent offenders, but this is not a big part, yet, of the broader conversation, nationally, about mass incarceration. To this point, Harris continues, ""If the emerging excitement for criminal justice reform is to be taken seriously and is to drastically reduce the numbers of people in prison, we have to address the long sentences we put on people for crimes and life without parole."" The ACLU reports that thousands of people in American prisons are serving sentences that are unnecessarily long and far out of proportion to their crimes. We must change sentencing policies that are sending violent offenders to prison for incredibly long periods of time in order to substantially reduce our prison population. Harris explains, ""We often fall into the same racialized fear-mongering framework or narrative for reducing the sentences of people with non-violent crimes while not doing so for people with violent crimes . . . when it is the same structural racism that is putting all of the (incarcerated) people in prison.""Mary Heinen, co-founder of the Prison Creative Arts Project, Soros Justice Fellow and Re-Entry Specialist/Decarceration Advocate at McPherson and Heinen Associates, emphasizes that we need to address women locked up for crimes related to domestic violence when talking about decarceration. She says, ""We must look at women's cases, case-by-case, related to domestic violence in any way and give women the opportunity to be released. Heinen continues,I know dozens and dozens of women who were convicted and incarcerated before domestic violence was understood as it is presently as a legal defense. Thousands of women have not had the opportunity to be considered for release according to current day legal and ethical standards.The ACLU reports that 85-90 percent of women currently incarcerated have a history of domestic and sexual abuse. We must look at alternatives to incarceration for any woman or person whose case relates to domestic violence and/or sexual abuse. Creating and implementing alternatives to incarceration for victims of domestic violence would contribute to the reduction of our prison population and shift the framework of our criminal justice system from one that is punitive to one that is restorative. Changing the framework  Evidence shows that there is no significant public safety benefit to imposing long and severe sentences on people who commit crimes, and this has been pointed out in the national debate. Jannetta comments, ""A lot of the conversation about longer sentences is taking place around the concept of effectiveness: does it reduce crime? That is an important question, but there is a moral and ethical question about how much punishment do we want to subject people to? How much punishment is enough?"" He emphasizes the role of this question as an ethical one and not an empirical one. If we are to seriously take on mass incarceration, policy changes must reflect cultural changes in how our society views crime and punishment. The question of how can we shift our culture from punitive to restorative is something we need to address while ethically taking on the dehumanizing impact that harsh and punitive sentencing has on human beings. Jannetta says, Where you need to be clever or innovative is making that palatable to people. We have recalibrated our sense of how much punishment is enough and who should be in prison. We have been living in the era of mass incarceration for a while now. In the mid-90's, we had already moved toward mass incarceration and that has been the situation and the status quo. There must be a substantial change of framework and policy considerations to change the status quo. One model that gets away from a punitive approach is the restorative justice model. According to the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, restorative justice seeks to repair harm done and restore the humanity of those involved in criminal acts. Thus far, there has been a move toward restorative justice practices in school districts, most notably in Oakland, CA, to thwart the school-to-prison pipeline and provide an alternative to punitive disciplinary policies. Talking about a restorative approach to criminal justice is imperative to changing the framework and should be a centerpiece of the national conversation on criminal justice reform. Looking abroad for innovative policy ideas  Harris talks about the importance of looking at what other countries are doing for violent crimes. Dr. Larry Gant, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Social Work, has been engaged in comparative policy work addressing the social, political and economic factors driving carceral policies, programs and services in the advanced western-style democracies of the U.S., Netherlands and Germany. He has talked extensively with police administrators, front line officers, attorneys, social workers, inmates, nongovernmental organizations (ngos) and community residents reflecting the disproportionate representation of poor and minority populations that comprise much of the carceral population. Gant reveals that in his discussions with EU colleagues (and some in the U.S.), there was shock that the U.S. for years was ""a laggard in mass incarceration"" and throughout the 1970's was ""internationally recognized for programs that educated, trained and placed people out of the criminal justice system. He says that cities such as Amsterdam and Gouda have implemented restorative justice programs that have been ""remarkably significant in reducing incarceration."" While Germany's prison system appears to resemble the U.S. approach in some respects, he adds ""there is a lack of privatization of the carceral enterprise, an availability of educational and training programs for people in these facilities, many routes to diversionary programs for many more population groups than in the US and a much greater reluctance to incarcerate first and ask questions later."" Dr. Gant states,If people are made to feel as if they are part of the community, that they matter and that there is a role for them that must be earned . . . but the paths are at least clear . . . the need or willingness to commit crime plummets. There are a number of NGO programs, many funded by local, state and national governments in the EU, that work on the front end of the system such as HALT, Gangway and Aufwind. There are advocacy networks, referral programs and supports that address conditions that may place more vulnerable, less visible members of these societies (e.g. political and economic refugees, youth, women and boys at risk for human labor and sex trafficking) as well. He indicates that the current path of the U.S. -- to incarcerate first and foremost within ""a context of economic distress, erosion of quality public education, marginal work opportunities and a desperation to think short-term"" -- has contributed to the crisis of mass incarceration in the U.S. and is, out-and-out, an inhumane approach. Community input and participation  That so many politicians and policymakers are talking about criminal justice reform is step in the right direction. ""Ok, now let me see your plan,"" says Harris. She continues,It will require strong leadership, visioning and work with the communities most impacted to come up with real solutions to safety. It can't be some D.C. think tank solution machine; we actually need to invest in communities in being self-sustaining and self-determining in creating solutions that are sustainable. It can't just be legislated.Seriously tackling mass incarceration requires that the voices of those most impacted by mass incarceration be at the forefront of the conversation. It also requires the creation of innovative ideas at the community and grassroots level to address issues such as community safety, educational equity, economic justice and re-entry. Joan Mendoza, social worker and innovative educator, explains her frustration with a lack of social and community-based supports for her brother, who was released from prison in California in January, 2015 after spending nearly two decades in prison. It has been an adjustment for not only her brother but her family as well. She says, ""After twenty years of being in prison, those are your people. Those are your connections. It is almost impossible task to ask him to leave everything behind. Because he has left all his friends and his entire social network behind."" Mendoza explains that the loss of her brother's social network and difficulty communicating with family members has contributed to the loneliness her brother has been experiencing after his release from prison. She says, ""We can't fully understand what it is like for them and that can be a really lonely place for them. How does the community prepare for prisoners to come home, especially for those who have been out for so long? How does the family prepare?"" She emphasizes the need for formerly incarcerated persons to have access to community-based programs and support systems that can assist in reconnecting them with their families and communities. She advocates that social workers play a role in reuniting former prisoners with their families and connecting former prisoners to resources that assist with job employment and transportation. Darius, Detroit-area activist, has serious concerns about the injustice of incarcerating people before they have had a trial. A relative of his spent approximately 18 months in prison before her trial. He says, ""This was because she did not having money for bail, which was a half a million dollars . . . a ridiculous amount for someone on a fixed income."" During this year, he had to take time off work and school as well as expend money and resources in order to support his family throughout the process. He describes the pretrial period as being emotionally draining and physically time-consuming. He says, ""Access to information and resources that would have helped his family make decisions throughout the pretrial process was limited."" His idea is to provide families with community resources, programs and supports that will help them navigate complicated court processes and make informed decisions. He strongly advocates ending the practice of using money for bail, which discriminates against people who are in a low-poor socioeconomic class, and providing alternatives to incarceration that are community-based. Mary Heinen, former prisoner and first prisoner student/co-founder of PCAP, suggests that resources and supports be given to communities, so they can create and implement alternative approaches to incarceration at the grassroots level and in a way that fits their needs. She advocates that teams of formerly incarcerated people and social workers work together to develop and implement problem-solving and conflict-resolution strategies that are used on the ground, when the conflict is occurring, as an alternative approach to incarceration. She says, ""Directly affected people are wise and experienced and hold answers to our most pressing issues concerning mass criminalization."" She advocates for community-programming and initiatives that address the root causes of incarceration in neighborhoods. Returning Citizens Working Against Mass Incarceration Photo taken by Center for Community Change in Detroit, MI on June 19, 2014Building the movement to end mass incarceration There are many ways to act at the community level to contribute to the movement to end mass incarceration. We can practice restorative justice with each other in our communities, support community coalitions and organizations that are addressing safety in creative and just ways, and advocate for economic justice and educational equity. We can support politicians on the right side of this issue, vote for policies that are building a stronger working and middle class and build community-driven social justice movements. Harris says,There are multiple levels in which people can get involved. You can practice everyday abolition by not calling the police and figure out interesting ways to address poverty and the war on poor people. Anything people are doing to fight for better wages, unionized workplaces, redistribution of wealth and taxing the rich is, indirectly, working towards a world without prisons. In a more direct way, there are communities that are getting organized and building working-class people power to fight back against the system. All of those pieces are necessary. Emily Harris invites us to join the national membership drive that the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights has initiated as a way to get involved in this movement to end mass incarceration. Ending mass incarceration will require but take much more than policy reform; it will demand creating a new vision for a kind of just world that restores our humanity and grows communities beyond prison walls."

Photo: https://www.lsa.umich.edu/pcap/gallery/14thannualexhibition2009  This art show is hosted by the Prison Creative Arts Project (PCAP) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. It was through the Prison Creative Arts Project that I first heard the term mass incarceration. In 2003, I enrolled in English 319: Theatre and Social Change, which was a PCAP prerequisite course taught by Buzz Alexander, professor and co-founder of the Prison Creative Arts Project. This course trained students to facilitate theatre workshops that enabled participants to imagine and shape their own plays in prisons, juvenile detention centers and high schools. We studied theoretical frameworks such as Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Freire and Theatre of the Oppressed by Augusto Boal; read about the devastating impact of the school-to-prison pipeline and zero tolerance policies; and learned how excessively and discriminately our country has been locking people up for decades. Through PCAP, I met committed, long-time activists such as Emily Harris, Jesse Jannetta and Mary Heinen. As the conversation about ending mass incarceration has spread to mainstream media outlets, I find myself wanting to hear from them and people directly impacted by mass incarceration. There is no doubt we have come a long way in shifting our national, collective consciousness around this issue. But is the national conversation regarding criminal justice reform moving in the right direction?   Emily Harris speaking at the 20th Annual Exhibition of Art by Michigan Prisoners. There is a national and bipartisan consensus that criminal justice reform needs to happen. In April, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made a speech about criminal justice reform at Columbia University that called for ""an end to the era of mass incarceration."" Emily Harris, advisory board member of the Prison Creative Arts Project and field director at the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights in Oakland, says,It is important that we have been able to create a political environment where Hillary Clinton can come forward and name how detrimental mass incarceration has been on our country and have that be a viable, political move as she is running for president. That our understanding of mass incarceration is shifting and the targeting of communities is so visible now . . . Clinton, and people like her, can no longer not take a position on that issue. The political will for criminal justice reform is here, but is the kind of reform being talked about enough to drastically reduce our prison population?What the conversation must be addressing  Ending mass incarceration will require envisioning a world beyond prisons and organizing/planning effectively to get us there. Decarceration is a necessary piece in this process. Jesse Jannetta, advisory board member of the Prison Creative Arts Project and senior research associate at the Urban Institute in D.C., says, ""If we want to decarcerate at the most basic level, there are two ways to do it: send fewer people to prison and/or don't keep people in prison as long. Everything that you would do to seriously reduce the prison population is in one or both of those options; it's as straightforward as that."" Of late, the national conversation around reducing lengthy sentences has been focused primarily on low-level offenders for non-violent and/or drug related offenses. Harris and Jannetta both agree this is not enough to make a significant dent in our current prison population. Jannetta comments,Right now, a lot of the conversation about reducing mass incarceration in public is focused on low-level and non-violent drug offenders. That is around 15 percent of the prison population nationwide. Let those people out tomorrow and the prison population will still be 85 percent of what it was. You can't cut the prison population in half by just talking about low-level drug offenders. You have to talk about violent offenders, but this is not a big part, yet, of the broader conversation, nationally, about mass incarceration. To this point, Harris continues, ""If the emerging excitement for criminal justice reform is to be taken seriously and is to drastically reduce the numbers of people in prison, we have to address the long sentences we put on people for crimes and life without parole."" The ACLU reports that thousands of people in American prisons are serving sentences that are unnecessarily long and far out of proportion to their crimes. We must change sentencing policies that are sending violent offenders to prison for incredibly long periods of time in order to substantially reduce our prison population. Harris explains, ""We often fall into the same racialized fear-mongering framework or narrative for reducing the sentences of people with non-violent crimes while not doing so for people with violent crimes . . . when it is the same structural racism that is putting all of the (incarcerated) people in prison.""Mary Heinen, co-founder of the Prison Creative Arts Project, Soros Justice Fellow and Re-Entry Specialist/Decarceration Advocate at McPherson and Heinen Associates, emphasizes that we need to address women locked up for crimes related to domestic violence when talking about decarceration. She says, ""We must look at women's cases, case-by-case, related to domestic violence in any way and give women the opportunity to be released. Heinen continues,I know dozens and dozens of women who were convicted and incarcerated before domestic violence was understood as it is presently as a legal defense. Thousands of women have not had the opportunity to be considered for release according to current day legal and ethical standards.The ACLU reports that 85-90 percent of women currently incarcerated have a history of domestic and sexual abuse. We must look at alternatives to incarceration for any woman or person whose case relates to domestic violence and/or sexual abuse. Creating and implementing alternatives to incarceration for victims of domestic violence would contribute to the reduction of our prison population and shift the framework of our criminal justice system from one that is punitive to one that is restorative. Changing the framework  Evidence shows that there is no significant public safety benefit to imposing long and severe sentences on people who commit crimes, and this has been pointed out in the national debate. Jannetta comments, ""A lot of the conversation about longer sentences is taking place around the concept of effectiveness: does it reduce crime? That is an important question, but there is a moral and ethical question about how much punishment do we want to subject people to? How much punishment is enough?"" He emphasizes the role of this question as an ethical one and not an empirical one. If we are to seriously take on mass incarceration, policy changes must reflect cultural changes in how our society views crime and punishment. The question of how can we shift our culture from punitive to restorative is something we need to address while ethically taking on the dehumanizing impact that harsh and punitive sentencing has on human beings. Jannetta says, Where you need to be clever or innovative is making that palatable to people. We have recalibrated our sense of how much punishment is enough and who should be in prison. We have been living in the era of mass incarceration for a while now. In the mid-90's, we had already moved toward mass incarceration and that has been the situation and the status quo. There must be a substantial change of framework and policy considerations to change the status quo. One model that gets away from a punitive approach is the restorative justice model. According to the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, restorative justice seeks to repair harm done and restore the humanity of those involved in criminal acts. Thus far, there has been a move toward restorative justice practices in school districts, most notably in Oakland, CA, to thwart the school-to-prison pipeline and provide an alternative to punitive disciplinary policies. Talking about a restorative approach to criminal justice is imperative to changing the framework and should be a centerpiece of the national conversation on criminal justice reform. Looking abroad for innovative policy ideas  Harris talks about the importance of looking at what other countries are doing for violent crimes. Dr. Larry Gant, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Social Work, has been engaged in comparative policy work addressing the social, political and economic factors driving carceral policies, programs and services in the advanced western-style democracies of the U.S., Netherlands and Germany. He has talked extensively with police administrators, front line officers, attorneys, social workers, inmates, nongovernmental organizations (ngos) and community residents reflecting the disproportionate representation of poor and minority populations that comprise much of the carceral population. Gant reveals that in his discussions with EU colleagues (and some in the U.S.), there was shock that the U.S. for years was ""a laggard in mass incarceration"" and throughout the 1970's was ""internationally recognized for programs that educated, trained and placed people out of the criminal justice system. He says that cities such as Amsterdam and Gouda have implemented restorative justice programs that have been ""remarkably significant in reducing incarceration."" While Germany's prison system appears to resemble the U.S. approach in some respects, he adds ""there is a lack of privatization of the carceral enterprise, an availability of educational and training programs for people in these facilities, many routes to diversionary programs for many more population groups than in the US and a much greater reluctance to incarcerate first and ask questions later."" Dr. Gant states,If people are made to feel as if they are part of the community, that they matter and that there is a role for them that must be earned . . . but the paths are at least clear . . . the need or willingness to commit crime plummets. There are a number of NGO programs, many funded by local, state and national governments in the EU, that work on the front end of the system such as HALT, Gangway and Aufwind. There are advocacy networks, referral programs and supports that address conditions that may place more vulnerable, less visible members of these societies (e.g. political and economic refugees, youth, women and boys at risk for human labor and sex trafficking) as well. He indicates that the current path of the U.S. -- to incarcerate first and foremost within ""a context of economic distress, erosion of quality public education, marginal work opportunities and a desperation to think short-term"" -- has contributed to the crisis of mass incarceration in the U.S. and is, out-and-out, an inhumane approach. Community input and participation  That so many politicians and policymakers are talking about criminal justice reform is step in the right direction. ""Ok, now let me see your plan,"" says Harris. She continues,It will require strong leadership, visioning and work with the communities most impacted to come up with real solutions to safety. It can't be some D.C. think tank solution machine; we actually need to invest in communities in being self-sustaining and self-determining in creating solutions that are sustainable. It can't just be legislated.Seriously tackling mass incarceration requires that the voices of those most impacted by mass incarceration be at the forefront of the conversation. It also requires the creation of innovative ideas at the community and grassroots level to address issues such as community safety, educational equity, economic justice and re-entry. Joan Mendoza, social worker and innovative educator, explains her frustration with a lack of social and community-based supports for her brother, who was released from prison in California in January, 2015 after spending nearly two decades in prison. It has been an adjustment for not only her brother but her family as well. She says, ""After twenty years of being in prison, those are your people. Those are your connections. It is almost impossible task to ask him to leave everything behind. Because he has left all his friends and his entire social network behind."" Mendoza explains that the loss of her brother's social network and difficulty communicating with family members has contributed to the loneliness her brother has been experiencing after his release from prison. She says, ""We can't fully understand what it is like for them and that can be a really lonely place for them. How does the community prepare for prisoners to come home, especially for those who have been out for so long? How does the family prepare?"" She emphasizes the need for formerly incarcerated persons to have access to community-based programs and support systems that can assist in reconnecting them with their families and communities. She advocates that social workers play a role in reuniting former prisoners with their families and connecting former prisoners to resources that assist with job employment and transportation. Darius, Detroit-area activist, has serious concerns about the injustice of incarcerating people before they have had a trial. A relative of his spent approximately 18 months in prison before her trial. He says, ""This was because she did not having money for bail, which was a half a million dollars . . . a ridiculous amount for someone on a fixed income."" During this year, he had to take time off work and school as well as expend money and resources in order to support his family throughout the process. He describes the pretrial period as being emotionally draining and physically time-consuming. He says, ""Access to information and resources that would have helped his family make decisions throughout the pretrial process was limited."" His idea is to provide families with community resources, programs and supports that will help them navigate complicated court processes and make informed decisions. He strongly advocates ending the practice of using money for bail, which discriminates against people who are in a low-poor socioeconomic class, and providing alternatives to incarceration that are community-based. Mary Heinen, former prisoner and first prisoner student/co-founder of PCAP, suggests that resources and supports be given to communities, so they can create and implement alternative approaches to incarceration at the grassroots level and in a way that fits their needs. She advocates that teams of formerly incarcerated people and social workers work together to develop and implement problem-solving and conflict-resolution strategies that are used on the ground, when the conflict is occurring, as an alternative approach to incarceration. She says, ""Directly affected people are wise and experienced and hold answers to our most pressing issues concerning mass criminalization."" She advocates for community-programming and initiatives that address the root causes of incarceration in neighborhoods. Returning Citizens Working Against Mass Incarceration Photo taken by Center for Community Change in Detroit, MI on June 19, 2014Building the movement to end mass incarceration There are many ways to act at the community level to contribute to the movement to end mass incarceration. We can practice restorative justice with each other in our communities, support community coalitions and organizations that are addressing safety in creative and just ways, and advocate for economic justice and educational equity. We can support politicians on the right side of this issue, vote for policies that are building a stronger working and middle class and build community-driven social justice movements. Harris says,There are multiple levels in which people can get involved. You can practice everyday abolition by not calling the police and figure out interesting ways to address poverty and the war on poor people. Anything people are doing to fight for better wages, unionized workplaces, redistribution of wealth and taxing the rich is, indirectly, working towards a world without prisons. In a more direct way, there are communities that are getting organized and building working-class people power to fight back against the system. All of those pieces are necessary. Emily Harris invites us to join the national membership drive that the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights has initiated as a way to get involved in this movement to end mass incarceration. Ending mass incarceration will require but take much more than policy reform; it will demand creating a new vision for a kind of just world that restores our humanity and grows communities beyond prison walls."

Head to the island of Crete. Crete is the biggest island in Greece but when you are there, it doesn't seem that way at all. There are crystalline blue waters and picturesque sunsets that fill the perfect sunny days.  Crystalline waters in Crete2. The food in Crete is terrific.

St Nicolas Bay Hotel  4. Next we headed to Santorini. The island looks like a fairytale town. On many days, I was truly speechless at the beauty of Santorini. Hands down, if you are looking for romance, you must stay in the area of Imerovigli. The hotels are built into the cliffs and are breathtaking. We stayed at the Grace Santorini where each room has it's own splash pool with a direct view of the sea. This is true decadence; the views of the sea are beyond any I have ever seen in my whole life. You can just sit, hold hands, and stare out yonder. Grace Santorini Hotel5. While in Santorini, don't forget to rent a 4 wheeler and jet around. It's a tad dangerous, so be careful. However, the excitement of riding on the curvy roads above the beautiful sea will get your adrenaline into high gear and set the mood for intense romance. If you get hungry on the ride, make sure to check out one of the romantic restaurants high above the waters edge, like Archipelagos.   4 Wheeler in Santorini6. And make sure to take a languid walk to the town of Oia. Oia, with all it's tourists is polar opposite to the serenity of Imerovigli, but just as beautiful. Oia is completely whitewashed with just a few splashes of color from the fresh flowers abound. If you are looking for a special meal in Oia before you head back to the hotel, choose the restaurant at the Andronis hotel. You sit out on a jutting cliff in King and Queen chairs and go through a tasting of 7 types of greek wines. You feel like you are on top of the world and more royal than Kate and William.  The Andronis Hotel 7. As a last stop, you must head to Mykonos, the trendiest island of Greece. In Mykonos, the action never stops. Things stay open until 6am! The town has so much energy, you can't help but get caught up in it. My recommendation, stay outside the town itself so you can get the peace and quiet, but then head into town to experience Greek nightlife. Mykonos  8. For accommodations, we stayed at Hotel Petasos Beach which was tres romantique. The rooms were modern and sophisticated with deck and pools right on the sea.

However, a handful of media outlets, including Mashable, Us Weekly and Elle, are presuming that the 17-year-old is working as a summer intern on the Lena Dunham-helmed series. This wouldn't be her first time behind the camera: last summer, Obama interned as a production assistant on Halle Berry's CBS series. The internship was so top secret that the first lady reportedly told Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti that he wasn't supposed to know about her daughter's LA visit.For more, head to Page Six."

The couple, who have been dating since 2006 and have three young children together, had a troubled relationship that played out over the last 10 seasons of ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" and its spinoff series. Kardashian, 36, finally decided to end the relationship when the 32-year-old's ""partying"" started getting out of hand once again, according to TMZ's source, who claims Disick hasn't been to the family's home in over a month. (This may explain those photos of Disick looking awfully cozy with his ex-girlfriend Chloe Bartoli in Monaco last week.)Sources also confirmed to E! News that the reality TV couple officially broke things off over the 4th of July weekend, telling the website Kardashian believes it's what's best for their children. ""Scott has been running around saying he's single,"" a source added, ""Kourtney dumped him after she saw the pics [in Monaco] and he hasn't been home after a month-long party binge.""Disick has publicly struggled with substance abuse issues for years. Last summer, he briefly entered rehab after a sleeping pill overdose, and following a particularly out of control weekend in Atlantic City, he entered rehab in Costa Rica for a week in March. ""I realize my issues are bigger than me and I'm ready to truly remedy this struggle I continue to battle,"" Disick said in a press release at the time. He later addressed the fact that his stay in treatment was so brief, telling People, ""The funny thing is, a lot of people were under the impression that I was going to this rehab facility in Costa Rica for a month, when the truth was, I was going for a week for one treatment that they have there.""Reps for Kardashian and Disick were not immediately available for comment.
