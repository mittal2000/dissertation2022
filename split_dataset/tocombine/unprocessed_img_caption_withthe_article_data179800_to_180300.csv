1,MONEY,Some Presidential Words on Federal Income Taxes,"Julian Block, Contributor
Tax attorney",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-income-taxes_us_5b9c2bd3e4b03a1dcc7cd456,Income taxes are such a pervasive and everyday part of our financial lives -- and such a central issue in presidential campaigns -- that they seem to have been around forever. They have not. Their debut is relatively recent.,2012-08-22,"MIAMI - APRIL 14: Felipe Castro holds a sign advertising a tax preparation office for people that still need help completing their taxes before the Internal Revenue Service deadline on April 14, 2010 in Miami, Florida. With only one day to go before the April 15th deadline to file taxes, accountants around the U.S. are swamped with people who waited until the last day to file.

They have not. Their debut is relatively recent. Abraham Lincoln created the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the predecessor of today's Internal Revenue Service, and introduced the first U.S. income taxes in 1862 to pay for the North's Civil War expenses. The Confederacy also imposed income taxes. After all, military wars, especially big ones, have to be paid for; at least, that used to be a fact of life. Mr. Lincoln's levies fell mainly on the well-to-do. There was an exemption from taxes for the first $600 of income. Once beyond that amount, the maximum rate topped off at five percent. The taxes were temporary, not becoming permanent until the ratification in 1913 of the Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.In an 1864 address to the 164th Ohio Regiment, Mr. Lincoln said, ""I apologize for the inequities in the practical applications of the tax, but if we should wait before collecting a tax to adjust the taxes upon each man in exact proportion with every other, we shall never collect any tax at all.""Another Republican understandably went out of his way not to poke fun at the tax collectors. Richard Milhous Nixon, caught up in the struggle to avoid impeachment and stay in office, informed the nation that ""The President, when the IRS is concerned, I assure you, is just another citizen and even more so."" TIME magazine waited until the issue that coincided with the tax filing deadline of April 15, 1974, to note Mr. Nixon ""offered that wry observation exactly one month ago, when advance warnings had been posted that he might owe half a million dollars in back taxes."" He resigned on August 9.Ronald Wilson Reagan stood out for his ability to make complicated subjects understandable. Mr. Reagan particularly liked to poke fun at the shortcomings of our modern tax system. For instance, he alerted future taxpayers to what awaited them in a talk to students at Northside High School in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 6, 1985If our current tax structure were a TV show, it would either be Foul-ups, Bleeps and Blunders, or Gimme a Break. If it were a record album, it would be Gimme Shelter. If it were a movie, it would be Revenge of the Nerds or maybe Take the Money and Run. And if the IRS ever wants a theme song, maybe they'll get Sting to do ""Every breath you take, every move you make, I'll be watching you.""Mr. Reagan stayed on message at a joint session of the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa on March 11, 1981: ""The American taxing structure, the purpose of which was to serve the people, began instead to serve the insatiable appetite of government. If you will forgive me, you know someone has once likened government to a baby. It is an alimentary canal with an appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other."" Mr. Reagan's vice president, George Herbert Walker Bush, had sewn up the nomination for president when delegates at the Republican convention in 1988 cheered his famous pledge of ""Read my lips -- no new taxes!"" However, as president, the elder George Bush had to deal with a Democratic Congress and to be more conciliatory, unlike his son. So despite his vow and because he knew it was helpful for the economy, President Bush crafted a deal with Congressional Democrats to raise new taxes in 1990, a decision that contributed to his re-election defeat in 1992 by William Jefferson Clinton.President Clinton easily won again in 1996, notwithstanding tax increases in 1993, becoming the first Democrat to be re-elected since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. As Mr. Clinton recalled, ""There's a lot of evidence you can sell people on tax increases if they think it's an investment."" Of course, tremendous growth in the 1990's also made it easier to sell increases. Mr. Clinton's other 1992 opponent was H. Ross Perot, a super-wealthy, third-party candidate making his first run for the office. Like TIME magazine with its Nixon revelation, Mr. Perot waited until the filing deadline to reveal that ""I'm delighted to pay big taxes. Big taxes mean big income."" During Mr. Clinton's first term, a key element of his legislative efforts was to attack the welfare system and promise to end welfare as we know it. In 1996, Republican candidate and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas invoked the same oratorical flourish when he declared that ""I will eliminate the IRS as we know it."" Mr. Dole attempted to tap into anti-IRS sentiment abroad in the land. Among other things, he promised a simpler system ""that will allow Americans to file their tax returns without the help of a lawyer or accountant, or both,"" yet another of the countless proposals for simplification that never get anywhere.Mr. Clinton was the first Democrat in the White House since James Earl Carter, a president who characterized ""the federal tax system"" as ""a disgrace to the human race,"" an assessment decidedly less upbeat than those of other Democratic chief executives.John Fitzgerald Kennedy, in an address to Congress on April 20, 1961, declared:One of the major characteristics of our tax system, and one in which we can take a great deal of pride, is that it operates primarily through individual self-assessment. The integrity of such a system depends upon the continued willingness of the people honestly and accurately to discharge this annual price of citizenship. To the extent that some people are dishonest or careless in their dealings with the government, the majority is forced to carry a heavier tax burden.While President Roosevelt was campaigning for a second term, he told a gathering in Worcester, Mass., on Oct. 31, 1936, that ""One sure way to determine the social conscience of a Government is to examine the way taxes are collected and how they are spent. And one sure way to determine the social conscience of an individual is to get his tax-reaction. Taxes, after all, are the dues that we pay for the privileges of membership in an organized society.""William Jennings Bryan campaigned unsuccessfully three times as the Democratic presidential candidate. During his famous acceptance speech at the party's National Convention in Chicago, on July 8, 1896, he declared that ""The income tax is just. It simply intends to put the burdens of government justly upon the backs of the people. I am in favor of an income tax. When I find a man who is not willing to bear his share of the burdens of the government which protects him, I find a man who is unworthy to enjoy the blessings of a government like ours.""Long before the introduction of income taxes, Andrew Jackson took a resigned view of all taxes. ""The wisdom of man never yet contrived a system of taxation that operates with perfect equality."" Julian Block is an attorney and author based in Larchmont, N.Y. He has been cited as: ""a leading tax professional"" (New York Times); ""an accomplished writer on taxes"" (Wall Street Journal); and ""an authority on tax planning"" (Financial Planning Magazine).

This isn't to say that the feelings and the division of property aren't similar, it's just much harder to untangle all the strings when you're getting a divorce.Here are some of the things people going through a divorce think -- some funny, some tragic, others somewhere in the middle:1) ""Is this the right thing to do?"" The act of divorcing can leave us overwhelmed and unsure of what to do.2) ""Is this REALLY the right thing?"" I'm getting a divorce, which means that I'm currently questioning everything I do, from painting my nails to tucking my kids into bed.3) ""Well, at least I won't have to deal with his mother (or family, as the case may be) again."" Sometimes, there are definite perks to divorce. This may (or may not) be one of them.4) ""I'll never see my in-laws again!"" Some of us get along so fabulously with our in-laws that the prospect of losing them may hurt a lot.5) ""How badly are we screwing up our kids?"" Parental guilt at its finest. When you're divorcing, make certain that you're doing right by the kids.6) ""Wow -- I get to date again!"" Once your marriage is over, you get to participate the newness of the whole dating scene again, and that can definitely be a good thing.7) ""Ugh, I'm back in the dating pool -- AGAIN!"" Some of us didn't enjoy dating, so the idea of getting back into the single world leaves us feeling sick to our stomachs.8) ""How can I survive alone?"" For those of us who've grown used to relying on having another person around, this can be downright terrifying.9) ""What did I do wrong?"" In most divorces, there is no one to blame, but human nature wants us to find fault when faced with a bad outcome. Divorce is no different.10) ""No one will love me again."" Divorce plays funny tricks on your mind, sort of like depression. You may feel that your ex was your true love, and that no one will ever love you again.What other things go through every divorcee's mind?More from The Stir:10 Things Couples Do That Make Single People Crazy10 Ways to Stay Sane During Your Divorce8 Simple Ways to Feel Sexy Again After a Divorce15 Tips for Getting Through a Divorce"

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2b372100005100c504c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Imagine waking up in the room of someone you've never met. A stranger delivers your morning coffee, fixed just the way you like it. Then a personal tour guide arrives, another stranger ready to show you around her city. You both hop into a car borrowed from a neighbor, another person you've only ever ""met"" online.The tour begins at a co-working space, where you meet entrepreneurs all focused on different types of social and environmental change, typing furiously into sleek laptops. Over lunch, you start feeling entrepreneurial yourself and invest money online to help someone get out of debt, or to kickstart a small business, or even to fund a nearby solar project. Then following the advice of one of your new friends, you decide to sell off some old clothes that your children have long outgrown. You end your day with an evening kayak ride, rented from yet another online peer-to-peer marketplace.Far-fetched as this might sound, this ""sharing economy"" already exists and the sharing lifestyle isn't nearly as philanthropic and risky as it might appear.Last Thursday, pioneers of the sharing economy gathered for an evening of discussion and collaboration at San Francisco's Commonwealth Club. Lisa Gansky, author of The Mesh: Why the Future of Business is Sharing, kicked off the panel by explaining how the economic recession, increased environmental awareness and Web 2.0 technologies have led us to a world where access to goods is trumping ownership of those goods. For example, when the average person in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe uses his or her car only 8 percent of the time, why do we all need to own cars when we could just borrow a car from a neighbor for far cheaper?If the idea of lending your car or home to a total stranger makes you nervous, you're not alone. That's why companies like RelayRides and Airbnb have put into place hefty insurance policies to cover any damages. TaskRabbit, an errand service where you can get a stranger to do anything from deliver your morning coffee to plan your holiday party runs each of their ""TaskRabbits"" through extensive background checks and video interviews.But perhaps one of the most trust-building factors is reputational. Companies within the sharing economy are essentially communities, and just as you wouldn't ask the teenage delinquent down the street to take care of your precious Fluffy, you can easily learn how people treated the last car they borrowed, place they rented or loan they received.While a community built on trust and sharing might sound more like a hippie fantasy than a profitable business venture, share economy startups have attracted the attention of Silicon Valley tycoons such as Google Ventures and Sequoia Capital as well as individual entrepreneurs who utilize the marketplaces as a source of income. Airbnb hosts average $6,000 per year for renting out their homes, RelayRides car renters generally earn enough to cover their monthly car payments and a few TaskRabbits are making $5,000 per month just from completing tasks. In the investing space, Gartner Group researchers estimate that the peer-to-peer financial lending market will reach $5 billion by 2013 led by companies like Lending Club and Prosper. My company, Solar Mosaic, will be launching an exciting new community marketplace to create clean energy soon.Sharing might be caring, but it's certainly not for just for the altruistic anymore. Greed got us into our economic and environmental crises; sharing might just get us out of them."
