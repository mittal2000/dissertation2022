0,POLITICS,Would Bernie Sanders Veto A $12-An-Hour Minimum Wage Bill?,Sam Stein and Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-minimum-wage_us_5714fc02e4b0060ccda3b8df,His staff says he won't negotiate against himself.,2016-04-18,"Hillary Clinton said she would sign a $15 minimum wage bill if one made it through Congress, though she has argued in favor of raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During last Thursday’s Democratic presidential debate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added a new wrinkle to the argument over the federal minimum wage, saying that if elected president, she would sign a bill raising it to $15 an hour -- the same number championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).The current federal minimum wage is just $7.25 an hour. Throughout the primary, Clinton has argued that $12 an hour would be a more appropriate number, and that once a $12 federal minimum wage is in place, she'd encourage states and cities to go even higher if their local economies could handle it.Clinton's stated willingness to sign a $15-an-hour bill complicated the case she'd been making for months. Sure enough, on Sunday, Clinton clarified that she would only sign such a bill under certain conditions. The new $15 wage floor would have to be phased in gradually, she said, and areas with lower costs of living would be subject to lower minimum wages to start.One thing, at least, is clear: The idea of a $12 minimum wage is negotiable for Clinton, depending on what's politically possible. Given that, it's not hard to wonder whether her opponent might be open to negotiation too. Would a President Sanders bend on his $15 stance and be amenable to a $12 minimum wage if that's all he could get? Or would he veto such a bill as insufficient?The Sanders campaign won’t directly answer this question. In the spin room after Thursday's debate, two representatives straight-out punted.“I'm not sure,” sad Nina Turner, a former state senator in Ohio and a prominent Sanders surrogate. “You would have to ask Senator Sanders. But one thing that I can say about him: He is for lifting people out of poverty and making sure that they have a living wage, and he's been very firm about the need to raise that wage to $15 an hour. And I've talked to people who do need that money.”""Well, I think you would have to directly ask Senator Sanders that question,” said Symone Sanders (no relation), a spokeswoman for the campaign. ""I haven't asked Senator Sanders myself, 'Would you sign the $12 bill or would you not sign the bill?' But what I can say is he is a staunch advocate and proponent that we need a $15 minimum wage, that there are people in this country working 40, 50, 60 hours a week and they can't earn enough money to put food on the table for their families. He has also said that we don't have to settle for incremental change, and our opinion is, a $12 minimum wage is incremental change.”Having been told to ask Sanders directly, The Huffington Post did the next best thing: We emailed the campaign for clarification. A spokesman, Warren Gunnels, called back and made the case that to answer the question would be to negotiate with oneself.“[Sanders] is strongly supportive of a $15-an-hour minimum wage, and he will do everything that he can as president to make sure that Congress passes a $15 minimum wage,” Gunnels said. “I think you've seen during this campaign, as he's said over and over again that he cannot do this alone, that this would take a strong grassroots movement of working people to make Congress do this. But Senator Sanders starts with a full loaf here, and the full loaf is $15 an hour. If you start off with half a loaf, you end up getting crumbs.”In short: Sanders wants $15 an hour, he will demand that Congress pass a bill for $15 an hour, and he won’t discuss what might happen if he's unsuccessful.There's certainly a reasonable argument to be made for this position. Minimum wages are a negotiation in Congress, and it pays to start off aiming high, knowing the opposition will try to haggle you down. In 2013, many Democrats grumbled when President Barack Obama put forth a humble $9 proposal. They later had to convince him to back their own, more ambitious bill. And much of the progress made by liberals on the city and state level has come courtesy of the aggressive push for $15. Republicans and business lobbies are much more willing to come to the table and hash out a deal for $10 or $12 when they're worried about $15 becoming a reality.In this regard, Clinton's and Sanders' respective positions on the issue say as much about their approach to politics as their convictions in policy. Clinton's openness to a $15 minimum wage could be seen as reflecting a common criticism from Sanders supporters -- namely, that her positions shift depending on the situation, and that she's too comfortable with incremental progress. Meanwhile, critics of Sanders might see his insistence on $15 as evidence that his proposals are too pie-in-the-sky to withstand the realities of Capitol Hill. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), a Clinton supporter, described the difference as being aspirational versus being pragmatic, ""which in some ways describes the differences between the two candidates.""That said, there's reason to think that Sanders would sign a $12-an-hour minimum wage bill as president -- that, indeed, he might be crazy not to. Talk of ""half a loaf"" notwithstanding, bringing the federal minimum wage up to $12 from $7.25 would be a huge victory by almost any reasonable measure. After all, the federal minimum wage has not been raised at all since 2009 -- and as Baldwin noted, when Democrats pushed for a $10.10 minimum wage in 2013, they were met with ""absolute obstruction from Republicans."" Even if Democrats take control of both chambers of Congress this November, there's no guarantee they would have the necessary votes to get to $15.Sanders certainly knows this. Back in 2013, the Senate Democratic caucus was firmly behind the push for $10.10 an hour. Sanders himself co-sponsored the bill and argued repeatedly into the spring of 2014 that the minimum wage needed to be $10.10 an hour “at least.”In the spring of 2015, the party pushed higher. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) introduced legislation in late April 2015 calling for a federal minimum wage of $12 an hour.But on that one, Sanders took a pass. He announced his run for the White House around that time and a few months later introduced his own $15-an-hour bill. Shortly thereafter, Sanders, who'd been making the case for $10.10 an hour not long ago, was describing $12 an hour as wholly insufficient in meeting the needs of the working poor. Why the change? Gunnels said that Sanders began listening more closely to the people at the front lines of the debate – the activists and fast-food workers – and adapted his legislation accordingly.“The told him loudly and clearly that they could not survive on $7.25 an hour, $8 an hour, $10 an hour,” said Gunnels. “If they're going to be able to feed their families and live a life of dignity, they need to make at least $15 an hour and they also need to have a union.”Certainly, others have listened too. In short order, the Fight For $15 movement has moved from the liberal fringes to the white-hot center of the Democratic presidential primary. But so far, there's one important constituency that hasn't gravitated toward $15 -- namely, Sanders’ colleagues in the Senate. His bill currently has five co-sponsors. Murray’s bill, for $12 an hour, has 33."
1,POLITICS,Carole King Is On The Prowl For Hillary Clinton Voters In New York City,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carole-king-clinton-voters_us_57151e76e4b06f35cb703047,It's not every day a four-time Grammy Award winner knocks on doors for votes.,2016-04-18,Carole King stands outside a random car parked in the West Village of New York City that is decked out in pro-Hillary Clinton messaging and artwork.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571527341900002d0056b7e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SOMEWHERE IN THE WEST VILLAGE, NEW YORK -- Walking through the streets of the West Village to rally support for Hillary Clinton, Carole King, the famed singer-songwriter, is confronted with a problem: not everyone believes that she is, in fact, Carole King.This can be frustrating at times, but it is hardly unexpected. Door-knocking is the grunt work of a presidential campaign -- the task of the college-aged plebs who have the time, passion and stamina to do it. No one reasonably expects a four-time Grammy Award winner to be the one pushing your buzzer, asking for a few moments of your time to talk political shop. But King enjoys being part of a campaign. Really, she's a junkie for this stuff; someone who, in between getting honored by the Kennedy Center, writing novels and consulting on a musical about her life, dives deep into environmental advocacy work and regales you with stories from presidential campaigns past. Take George McGovern, her first time volunteering: ""The concert went well, the election didn't."" This cycle, Clinton is King's candidate. And if electing Clinton requires face-to-face interactions with complete strangers, well then, pavement she will pound. And so, for an hour on a pleasant Friday afternoon, she did just that, taking me along on her walk down West 11th Street to persuade those voters the Clinton campaign has identified as fence-sitters in the upcoming New York primary. King is a logical weapon to deploy in this part of the city. It's an enclave for artists and native New Yorkers who bought their homes long before the real estate market made them pricier than 19th-century French chateaux. These people grew up with her, some possibly literally (King was raised in Brooklyn). She relates to them in ways your 19-year-old NYU student Bernie Sanders volunteer can't.But first, King has to get in the door.Things get off to a promising enough start. King buzzes her first apartment and is let right in, no questions asked. ""That was odd,"" she notes after already having rushed to take advantage of the sight-unseen hospitality. We make our way to the elevator (you save steps where you can) and head for the fourth floor. Down the hall, King knocks on the door and then launches into what I quickly discover is her customary approach: quickly ridding the air of any suspense or heuristics. ""I am the singer Carole King,"" she says through the peephole. ""It is actually me."" The door opens.""Oh, my God. Why me?"" the woman asks. Quickly, it becomes apparent that this is a far more emotional moment than anyone anticipated. ""I just lost my mom and the last album we listened to was 'Tapestry,'"" she says.King handles this remarkably well, expressing sympathy for the loss, asking about the family's history and gradually bringing the conversation to an easy medium. Soon, we're back on politics, only to discover that this might be the least difficult pitch in campaign history.""I'm a woman who grew up during a time when women were second-class citizens,"" our host says. ""I want Hillary to do it just like Obama did it, when we needed to have an African-American president."" King decides to aim higher. Perhaps, she asks, there might be time for phone-banking before Tuesday? Our host says she will. They talk a little Bernie, share memories of New York, take a photo, and then we're off. Canvassing isn't the purview of the long-winded.We walk down the street to our second stop -- an elegant brownstone -- only to find complications behind the front door. The husband, not the wife, is home. He's not on the Clinton campaign target list. In fact, he's not a registered Democrat, which is a prerequisite for voting in the primary. King, ever quick on her feet, suggests that he might canvas for Clinton instead of voting.""Jeepers,"" the man named John replies. ""I'm not sure about that ... My personality is not the best for that kind of undertaking.""  John, it turns out, is a self-described recluse: a painter who doesn't own a cell phone. King empathizes. ""Dude, I am too!"" she says -- of the reclusiveness, not the forsaking of cellular devices. At this point, she's a heat-seeking, Clinton-backing missile. ""She represented you for eight years,"" she says in reference to Clinton's Senate stint, ""now it's your turn to represent her."" John agrees to phone-bank for Clinton, though I'm a little less bullish than King that he'll follow through. As we leave, he gives me his assessment of her salesmanship. ""She feels real,"" he says. King seems lighter on her feet as we head farther down the block. She's batting a thousand so far. ""I'm surprised so many people are home,"" she says, before pressing the next buzzer. Five seconds go by and no one answers. ""And ... apparently they're not.""At the next stop, we encounter more problems. King asks the woman who answers the buzzer if she might be able to come up and speak to her about Clinton. No is the reply. ""I would ring the apartments on the first floor."" We are generally confused by this. What's going on on the first floor? Alas, we choose to leave the building entirely rather than further explore.But success is growing elusive now. At the next building, a woman named Elena answers the buzzer, King explains who she is, and suddenly we have silence. We suspect Elena thought it was a prank. Next up is another John, this one more overtly reclusive than the last. ""I'm not going to let you in,"" he says, explaining he's a Bernie backer. He offers to continue the conversation over the intercom and King, who has only complimented Sanders throughout the day, is unfazed. She encourages John to rally behind the nominee, whoever it is, and then lets it go. There is no point in trying to convert the true believers. Far easier to convince yourself of their intentions. ""He doesn't want a Republican any more than we do,"" she says.We move on to Gail, who answers the buzzer but can't actually hear what King is saying. So we ring another person in her building. ""My name is Carole King, and I'm a singer,"" comes the usual refrain. There is confusion at this point and another round of silence too. The presumption is we've had another hanger-upper. But then, suddenly, a face emerges outside a second-floor window. The woman looks down at King in disbelief. ""I didn't believe you!"" she proclaims.They talk for a bit, the woman explaining that she supports Bernie; King, with her preternaturally sunny disposition, encouraging her to rally behind Hillary if she wins. There is no debate. Only talk of the dangers of Donald Trump and the wonders of King's musical career.And then it's over. King suggests that she try hitting up a few more voters but the Clinton aide who is staffing her today whisks her away.There is more campaigning to do elsewhere in New York: a ""Women for Hillary"" organizing event in Manhattan that King must attend. She's already done one of those today, in Nyack, in addition to media interviews and an organizing event in White Plains. The day before, King phone-banked in Manhattan, canvassed in Park Slope and attended a debate watch party. All told, she spent three hours over two days knocking on 50 doors. She's 74.Johanna Barr contributed reporting."

McCollum Won't Stop Working, On And Off The Court",Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cj-mccollum_us_570bdc22e4b0142232498ce1,From unheralded recruit and small-school phenom to NBA star.,2016-04-18,"""I was always thinking NBA,"" McCollum tells The Huffington Post.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570fef8d1600002b0031bbdf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lehigh University isn't exactly a breeding ground for NBA talent. Then again, 5-foot-2, 108-lb. high school freshmen generally don't get blue chip college recruiters buzzing, let alone Division 1 basketball programs.But the journey of Canton, Ohio, native C.J. McCollum from small-school collegiate phenom to budding NBA superstar is hardly conventional.McCollum has become the overwhelming front-runner for the NBA's Most Improved Player of the Year award while helping lead the upstart Portland Trail Blazers to a 44-win regular season in the ultra competitive Western Conference and third straight playoff appearance.""I was always thinking NBA,"" McCollum tells The Huffington Post.Entering the league, McCollum was coming off a broken left foot, a devastating injury and arduous recovery that forced him to miss most of his senior campaign. Portland, meanwhile, was a talented team on the cusp of success, which meant it didn't need its high-profile rookie to instantly become a crucial contributor.""When you watch, you get more hungry,"" McCollum, a journalism major who served as an editor for the Lehigh school paper, says of the experience.Preparation and his patented late-night workouts have become the fulcrum to McCollum's success. They have provided him with the upper hand over other young players forced to overhaul their studying habits once they reach the league.""That's the thing that really sets him apart,"" says Ryan Krueger, current D-League assistant coach and one of the Lehigh assistants during part of McCollum's tenure. ""He's the one guy that I felt like worked like a pro while he was in college. The guy just absolutely lived in the gym. He wore out my phone -- Friday night, Sunday morning.""The 24-year-old McCollum, who talks about his finishing ability as ""a work in progress,"" isn't satisfied with his game yet. He savors the process as much as the result, because of the skills and confidence it affords him come game time. Such a consistent work ethic was instilled by his older brother Errick, who this year earned All-Eurocup honors playing for Turkey's Galatasaray, and who hounded C.J. even when the NBA seemed like an unreachable goal.""He preached the fundamentals,"" McCollum says. ""To understand that the only thing I am going to get out of it is what I put into it, so I just obsessed over it.""Current Whitworth College head coach Matt Logie -- who himself enjoyed a standout career at Lehigh and still owns the school's all-time 3-point record -- was a Lehigh assistant during McCollum's collegiate years. Logie says he's never seen relentless dedication to the craft like McCollum's. ""He lives and breathes basketball,"" Logie tells HuffPost.""He was always in the gym,"" he said. ""He made basketball his priority -- along with school -- and there was nobody that worked harder.""Teeming with confidence and coaches for gym time, the 6-foot-4, 200 lb. McCollum has continued to work, albeit differently, at the pro level. ""Efficient workouts,"" he believes, have been the difference, including understanding ""that you're gonna be getting guarded by a bigger guy.""""I just try and work on mastering the shots I have -- step-backs, floaters, having a different arsenal, that way I can always get to that shot,"" he says. Despite playing admirably in a first-round playoff defeat to rugged Memphis and perennial All-NBA defender Tony Allen last season -- he averaged over 17 points on a stellar 48 percent 3-point shooting -- a hardly satisfied McCollum entered the summer upset, feeling he was too one-dimensional. ""One of the things that stuck with me was that I didn't distribute the ball and make people around me better,"" he says. The result became an offseason spent tirelessly working on his creativity: ""How can I create shots for others"" became a daily mindset.""You're gonna attract attention as a scorer, but it's what do you do with that attention,"" McCollum adds.McCollum's newfound emphasis on expanding his offensive repertoire has paid dividends. No player in the league has made a larger jump in scoring (6.8 to 20.8), but he is even prouder of his 4.3 assists, up from just 1 per game last year, and the fact that he's more than doubled his rebounding output. And just as importantly, he has done it efficiently, precisely as he planned for.While consistently drawing top-notch perimeter defensive assignments, McCollum has become an elite long-distance sniper, converting 42 percent from deep. In fact, he is one of only six NBA players to attempt more than 300 3-pointers, while making over 40 percent.McCollum has never shot it better from the floor or the free-throw line either, and the Blazers' offense -- despite the loss of free agent All-NBA power forward LaMarcus Aldridge to the Spurs, along with starting wings Wesley Matthews and Nicolas Batum -- has been the beneficiary, boasting an improved offensive efficiency, true shooting percentage and effective field goal clip.Aiding his progression has been watching film, the foundation of everything he does on the basketball court. If in college it was more about his game and specific NBA sets, McCollum now emulates specific moves and footwork.""I gotta over-consume myself with as much information as possible,"" he says, ""and be able to go into the NBA and understand different teams' systems, be able to understand spacing, understand angles.""""I think one of the biggest things that helped me was just asking questions,"" he continues. ""Talking to [Chris Paul], when I was college, 'What did you work on and how many shots do you shoot.'""Watch enough of McCollum and it may not come as a surprise that his favorite moves include Tony Parker's finishing ability, Isaiah Thomas, Rip Hamilton staggers and pin-downs, Allen Iverson zipper cuts, George Hill, Goran Dragic, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, ""LeBron's left-handed hooks and finishes, or all of Steph Curry's right-hand, right-leg scoops.""And perhaps not surprisingly either, it was also during college that McCollum learned how to watch film.""He's got a special sense of the game,"" Krueger says. ""We watched every single [collegiate] game he was ever a part of — we would talk about why certain things didn’t happen. When guys bug you and ask you for film, you really feel like you’re accomplishing something. He wanted practice clips, game clips and he wanted to watch them together.""When McCollum came to Lehigh as a freshman in 2009, the moribund Mountain Hawks had reached a measly three NCAA Tournaments in program history. After leading the conference in scoring while earning Patriot League Player of the Year honors, he propelled the school back to the dance. Naturally, the tenor of the program began to change. It wasn't quite the Steph Curry-Davidson effect, but it had a similar tone.""One of the reasons he came to Lehigh was he wanted to be different,"" Logie says. ""When we got to the NCAA Tournament his freshman year, he was like, 'OK, this is my time.'""Logie was right. Despite losing to a 1-seeded Kansas team, McCollum contributed 26 points and 7 rebounds, displaying on a national stage what his teammates and coaches knew all along: He was a budding superstar.Fast-forward to 2012, and McCollum enjoyed his marquee March Madness moment, spearheading a massive upset over heavily favored Duke -- the first and only tournament win in program history. The junior posted a game-high 30 points, 6 rebounds and 6 assists, including a late-game 3-point dagger just when it seemed Coach K's crew might come back.McCollum, who also hosts a radio show and writes for The Players' Tribune, has plenty he wants to accomplish aside from hoops. He's particularly interested in helping provide writing opportunities for Oregon youth, and earlier this year developed a journalism mentorship program, CJ's Press Pass, in partnership with a local high school.""I am trying to give back what I can, when I can,"" McCollum says. ""I have to take advantage of the platform.""He has also purchased 40 tickets per game for local youth organizations like the Boys and Girls Club, SMART (Start Making A Reader Today) and Friends of the Children, so they can join ""CJ.'s Crew"" and attend home games.Few people have been around the NBA game more than Earl Watson, a former teammate of McCollum's in Portland who is currently the Phoenix Suns' interim head coach.""C.J. has always had to prove himself,"" Watson tells HuffPost. ""He is the perfect role model of resilience.""He added: ""You must know he will never stop.""Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

McCollum from small-school collegiate phenom to budding NBA superstar is hardly conventional.McCollum has become the overwhelming front-runner for the NBA's Most Improved Player of the Year award while helping lead the upstart Portland Trail Blazers to a 44-win regular season in the ultra competitive Western Conference and third straight playoff appearance.""I was always thinking NBA,"" McCollum tells The Huffington Post.Entering the league, McCollum was coming off a broken left foot, a devastating injury and arduous recovery that forced him to miss most of his senior campaign. Portland, meanwhile, was a talented team on the cusp of success, which meant it didn't need its high-profile rookie to instantly become a crucial contributor.""When you watch, you get more hungry,"" McCollum, a journalism major who served as an editor for the Lehigh school paper, says of the experience.Preparation and his patented late-night workouts have become the fulcrum to McCollum's success. They have provided him with the upper hand over other young players forced to overhaul their studying habits once they reach the league.""That's the thing that really sets him apart,"" says Ryan Krueger, current D-League assistant coach and one of the Lehigh assistants during part of McCollum's tenure. ""He's the one guy that I felt like worked like a pro while he was in college. The guy just absolutely lived in the gym. He wore out my phone -- Friday night, Sunday morning.""The 24-year-old McCollum, who talks about his finishing ability as ""a work in progress,"" isn't satisfied with his game yet. He savors the process as much as the result, because of the skills and confidence it affords him come game time. Such a consistent work ethic was instilled by his older brother Errick, who this year earned All-Eurocup honors playing for Turkey's Galatasaray, and who hounded C.J. even when the NBA seemed like an unreachable goal.""He preached the fundamentals,"" McCollum says. ""To understand that the only thing I am going to get out of it is what I put into it, so I just obsessed over it.""Current Whitworth College head coach Matt Logie -- who himself enjoyed a standout career at Lehigh and still owns the school's all-time 3-point record -- was a Lehigh assistant during McCollum's collegiate years. Logie says he's never seen relentless dedication to the craft like McCollum's. ""He lives and breathes basketball,"" Logie tells HuffPost.""He was always in the gym,"" he said. ""He made basketball his priority -- along with school -- and there was nobody that worked harder.""Teeming with confidence and coaches for gym time, the 6-foot-4, 200 lb. McCollum has continued to work, albeit differently, at the pro level. ""Efficient workouts,"" he believes, have been the difference, including understanding ""that you're gonna be getting guarded by a bigger guy.""""I just try and work on mastering the shots I have -- step-backs, floaters, having a different arsenal, that way I can always get to that shot,"" he says. Despite playing admirably in a first-round playoff defeat to rugged Memphis and perennial All-NBA defender Tony Allen last season -- he averaged over 17 points on a stellar 48 percent 3-point shooting -- a hardly satisfied McCollum entered the summer upset, feeling he was too one-dimensional. ""One of the things that stuck with me was that I didn't distribute the ball and make people around me better,"" he says. The result became an offseason spent tirelessly working on his creativity: ""How can I create shots for others"" became a daily mindset.""You're gonna attract attention as a scorer, but it's what do you do with that attention,"" McCollum adds.McCollum's newfound emphasis on expanding his offensive repertoire has paid dividends. No player in the league has made a larger jump in scoring (6.8 to 20.8), but he is even prouder of his 4.3 assists, up from just 1 per game last year, and the fact that he's more than doubled his rebounding output. And just as importantly, he has done it efficiently, precisely as he planned for.While consistently drawing top-notch perimeter defensive assignments, McCollum has become an elite long-distance sniper, converting 42 percent from deep. In fact, he is one of only six NBA players to attempt more than 300 3-pointers, while making over 40 percent.McCollum has never shot it better from the floor or the free-throw line either, and the Blazers' offense -- despite the loss of free agent All-NBA power forward LaMarcus Aldridge to the Spurs, along with starting wings Wesley Matthews and Nicolas Batum -- has been the beneficiary, boasting an improved offensive efficiency, true shooting percentage and effective field goal clip.Aiding his progression has been watching film, the foundation of everything he does on the basketball court. If in college it was more about his game and specific NBA sets, McCollum now emulates specific moves and footwork.""I gotta over-consume myself with as much information as possible,"" he says, ""and be able to go into the NBA and understand different teams' systems, be able to understand spacing, understand angles.""""I think one of the biggest things that helped me was just asking questions,"" he continues. ""Talking to [Chris Paul], when I was college, 'What did you work on and how many shots do you shoot.'""Watch enough of McCollum and it may not come as a surprise that his favorite moves include Tony Parker's finishing ability, Isaiah Thomas, Rip Hamilton staggers and pin-downs, Allen Iverson zipper cuts, George Hill, Goran Dragic, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, ""LeBron's left-handed hooks and finishes, or all of Steph Curry's right-hand, right-leg scoops.""And perhaps not surprisingly either, it was also during college that McCollum learned how to watch film.""He's got a special sense of the game,"" Krueger says. ""We watched every single [collegiate] game he was ever a part of — we would talk about why certain things didn’t happen. When guys bug you and ask you for film, you really feel like you’re accomplishing something. He wanted practice clips, game clips and he wanted to watch them together.""When McCollum came to Lehigh as a freshman in 2009, the moribund Mountain Hawks had reached a measly three NCAA Tournaments in program history. After leading the conference in scoring while earning Patriot League Player of the Year honors, he propelled the school back to the dance. Naturally, the tenor of the program began to change. It wasn't quite the Steph Curry-Davidson effect, but it had a similar tone.""One of the reasons he came to Lehigh was he wanted to be different,"" Logie says. ""When we got to the NCAA Tournament his freshman year, he was like, 'OK, this is my time.'""Logie was right. Despite losing to a 1-seeded Kansas team, McCollum contributed 26 points and 7 rebounds, displaying on a national stage what his teammates and coaches knew all along: He was a budding superstar.Fast-forward to 2012, and McCollum enjoyed his marquee March Madness moment, spearheading a massive upset over heavily favored Duke -- the first and only tournament win in program history. The junior posted a game-high 30 points, 6 rebounds and 6 assists, including a late-game 3-point dagger just when it seemed Coach K's crew might come back.McCollum, who also hosts a radio show and writes for The Players' Tribune, has plenty he wants to accomplish aside from hoops. He's particularly interested in helping provide writing opportunities for Oregon youth, and earlier this year developed a journalism mentorship program, CJ's Press Pass, in partnership with a local high school.""I am trying to give back what I can, when I can,"" McCollum says. ""I have to take advantage of the platform.""He has also purchased 40 tickets per game for local youth organizations like the Boys and Girls Club, SMART (Start Making A Reader Today) and Friends of the Children, so they can join ""CJ.'s Crew"" and attend home games.Few people have been around the NBA game more than Earl Watson, a former teammate of McCollum's in Portland who is currently the Phoenix Suns' interim head coach.""C.J. has always had to prove himself,"" Watson tells HuffPost. ""He is the perfect role model of resilience.""He added: ""You must know he will never stop.""Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

According to Broomfield News, about 80 students either donated their locks or shaved their heads on stage in support of Marlee at a school event on called ""Be Bold, Be Brave, Go Bald.""The March 16 event helped raise $25,000 for St. Baldrick's Foundation, an organization that supports childhood cancer treatment research.""I didn't think that many people would shave their heads, but I feel good about going back to school and not being the only bald one,"" Marlee told Today.com.Along with the students, three female teachers, both male principals and even a student's mom also got their heads shaved on stage. Erin Dupper, Marlee’s first-grade teacher, not only volunteered to buzz off her tresses, she also let Marlee do the honors.""The kids getting to see Marlee upbeat, happy and brave instead of the sick girl they were imagining made it a celebration,"" Dupper told Today.com.Broomfield News reports that Marlee's mother, Shelly Pack, noticed a bump on her daughter's left foot last year. Since Marlee played soccer, she chalked it up to a sports-related injury. Yet, after a month, the bump was still there and the family sought medical attention. It was soon determined that Marlee had alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare cancer that forms in the body's soft tissues, and the bump was a tumor. Her foot was amputated and Marlee began 40 weeks of chemotherapy.According to Fox31 Denver, Marlee found out in early March she is officially in remission. .As for the way her classmates reacted to her return to school, Marlee was incredibly touched.""It's just amazing because they all shaved their heads for me,"" Marlee told Broomfield News.

Rick Snyder (R) for the avoidable lead poisoning emergency in the city of Flint, according to a poll released Monday. Michigan State University's latest State of the State Survey revealed that 57 percent of respondents said Snyder's administration was most responsible for the city's water crisis. That includes the governor himself, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and Darnell Earley, the former emergency manager of Flint who was appointed by Snyder.Another 13 percent of those polled said various local officials were most responsible for the crisis, and 17 percent blamed “everyone.”The governor's approval rating has reached its lowest point since he took office in 2011.Flint switched its water source to the Flint River two years ago to cut costs, but failed to implement corrosion control measures. Lead from aging pipes leached into the system, and a pediatrician documented elevated blood lead levels in the city’s children. Even very small amounts of lead can have long-term neurological effects and health problems. Residents had complained about smelly, discolored water coming out of their taps since 2014, and experts began raising concerns last year. Snyder declared a state of emergency in January, but has been criticized for his slow response.The question of who's at fault for the contaminated water has been widely debated. Snyder has accepted responsibility and directed resources toward improving water quality in Flint, but has also blamed his own staff and federal regulators.According to the MSU survey, Snyder’s approval rating dropped sharply after the extent of the crisis came to light. Though 41.8 percent of Michigan residents polled called his performance “excellent” or “good” in the fall, only one-quarter felt that way in the most recent poll. Meanwhile, the portion of respondents rating the governor’s performance as “poor” climbed from 20.9 to 44.1 percent.MSU interviewed 995 people between Jan. 25 and March 26 for the survey, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.11 percent. (The previous edition of the routine survey took place from Oct. 25 to Dec. 23, 2015.) The survey takes two months to complete because of the length of the questionnaires, number of interviewers and relatively large sample size, survey director Charles Ballard explained in an email. Ballard is an economics professor at MSU.The Institute for Public Policy and Social Research, part of MSU's College of Social Science, conducts the survey several times a year. This time, it coincided with growing national focus on Flint.“If we combine the ‘excellent’ and ‘good’ to get a total-favorable category, we found that Gov. Snyder had 29 percent positive in January, 28 percent positive in February and then dropped to 16 percent positive in March,” Ballard said. “My interpretation is that the steady drip of news about the Flint crisis probably had a cumulative adverse effect for Gov. Snyder.”Flint’s struggles have brought attention to crumbling infrastructure and the scourge of lead pipes in cities nationwide. The city of Flint is spending millions on upgrades, and the MSU survey offers some evidence of public support. Since 1995, the survey has asked residents what they consider to be the most important problem facing Michigan's governor and legislature. Offered four different choices, only a tiny fraction of respondents said “infrastructure of cities” -- until the latest survey, when the number jumped to 32.5 percent. Respondents ranked the issue as a bigger problem than all the other options, including jobs and the economy.Despite these concerns, a slightly larger portion of respondents said they could trust state government “nearly all or most of the time” since the fall survey. There was also a 5-point increase in the number of residents who said they trusted state government “seldom” or “almost never.” "

8,POLITICS,Paul Ryan Will Get 15 Minutes Of Fame At The Supreme Court ... Just Because,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-supreme-court_us_570fe687e4b0bec62a14bdf2,But the court should think twice before giving too much weight to what the House has to say on immigration.,2016-04-18,Does House Speaker Paul Ryan get to speak on immigration for every member of Congress -- past and present?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571143ee1900002e0056b596.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) isn't expected at the Supreme Court on Monday, when the justices hear arguments in an important case over President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration. But he and the House of Representatives will be there symbolically -- if for no other reason than they felt the need to join the case at a very late stage in the game to make a point about the Constitution.At issue in Monday's case, which will be heard by an eight-member court, is whether the president fashioned his deportation relief programs, aimed at shielding millions of people, in accordance with the laws that Congress gave him to enforce.To stress the point that he didn't, near the end of the hearing, the court will hear for about 15 minutes from Erin Murphy, a high-powered attorney from Bancroft Pllc. The House retained Murphy's white-shoe law firm at the eleventh hour, after its members passed a resolution along party lines to file a brief opposing the president's position at the Supreme Court.That in itself was highly unusual, since the House already has a bipartisan legal advisory group -- made up by Ryan and House leadership from both parties -- that approves legal action whenever members of Congress feel the need to defend their institutional interests in court.But Ryan insisted on the resolution, offering a floor speech about the need to speak ""as an institution"" in the immigration case, lest Obama gets away with running roughshod over the immigration laws and the separation of powers.""We are the body closest to the people,"" Ryan said. ""And if we're going to maintain the principle of self-government -- if we're going to maintain the principle of government by consent of the governed -- then the legislative branch needs to be writing the laws.""Never mind that the House never bothered to act on immigration reform after the Senate had done so in 2013.So the brief was filed -- two weeks ago. And Bancroft, in coordination with lawyers for Texas and the 25 states seeking to invalidate the executive actions on immigration, also filed a petition for the House to participate at oral arguments. The court granted that request a few days later, possibly out of deference to a chamber of Congress it is not used to hearing from directly.The House is unlikely to bring anything particularly game-changing to oral arguments. Judging from its brief, Murphy, its lawyer, will likely have much to say about how Congress makes the laws and the executive must enforce them as written, and that any refusal to do so is an abdication of its responsibilities.But the Supreme Court should probably think twice before giving too much weight to Murphy's argument -- and instead should pay more heed to the parties that have been in the case all along: Texas, the federal government, and three women who will be representing the interests of undocumented immigrants.The lawyer representing the House ""certainly does not represent the whole Congress serving today, much less the prior Congresses that wrote America’s immigration laws,"" wrote former Rep. Howard Berman (R-Cal.) and Elizabeth Wydra, the president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center.Wydra's organization, which has been involved in the case for longer than the House has, helped co-author a brief on behalf of Berman and a bipartisan coalition of former members of Congress who took part of the deliberations and drafting of key parts of the immigration code. Implicit in Wydra and Berman's argument is that the current law is a complex web of statutes, written and rewritten over time by different lawmaking bodies that worked hard to create an immigration system that is functioning -- more or less -- the way they envisioned it.Or, as Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) wrote in The New York times on Monday: Obama ""has operated under longstanding provisions of law that give the executive branch discretion in enforcement. This presidential prerogative has been recognized explicitly by the Supreme Court.""Why should the current House, which hasn't done anything meaningful to fix the immigration laws, be taken more seriously by the Supreme Court than the ones that actually did something to create the current system, however imperfect it may be?That's more a political question than a legal one. But it is certainly one the justices should take into account in a case that, at its core, is as much about politics as it is about what a president can do under the law."

The next step will be to safely transport human beings from their native planet.Last year, NASA named the first four astronauts who will fly on the first-ever U.S. commercial spaceflight. The crew -- comprising NASA's Robert Behnken, Eric Boe, Douglas Hurley and Sunita Williams -- is set to travel in spacecraft built by Boeing and SpaceX. They could take off as soon as the middle of next year. ""It's a really exciting time,"" said Samantha Cristoforetti, a fellow record-breaking astronaut from Italy who was at the ""A Beautiful Planet"" premiere. ""The next few years will be interesting.""

12,POLITICS,Muslim Student Who Was Kicked Off Southwest Flight After Speaking Arabic Just Wants An Apology,Lydia O'Connor and Kelly Chen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/muslim-student-kicked-off-southwest_us_57140cdde4b0060ccda38e51,He was talking to his uncle on the phone.,2016-04-18,"Khairuldeen Makhzoomi, 26, said he was overwhelmed as officers searched him in the airport after he was kicked off his plane.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571465ad1600002a0031be42.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A University of California student says he was removed from a Southwest Airlines flight after another passenger raised suspicions about him speaking Arabic.Khairuldeen Makhzoomi, a 26-year-old political science and Near Eastern literature student at UC Berkeley, is speaking out now about his experience with the airline on April 6. Makhzoomi, a Muslim Iraqi refugee who fled the country in 2002 after his Iraqi diplomat father was killed under Saddam Hussein’s regime, said he was seated on a flight going from Los Angeles to Oakland and speaking Arabic on the phone with his uncle before takeoff when a nearby passenger made eye contact with him and got up from her seat.That's when he thought, ""I hope she's not reporting me,"" he told The Huffington Post. Within minutes, a Southwest employee approached Makhzoomi and escorted him off the plane and back into the airport, where he was detained and questioned by multiple security guards with police dogs and FBI officers about his phone call and his luggage, all in front of dozens of onlookers. When the officers searched his genital area and asked if he was hiding a knife, Makhzoomi said the situation became overwhelming.""At that moment, it was the maximum point of humiliation, he said. ""My eyes began to water."" He learned during questioning that the passenger who reported him thought he said the word ""shahid,"" which means martyr, and associated it with terrorism. Makhzoomi had been telling his uncle about a dinner he was returning from at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council with Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon and said ""inshallah,"" meaning ""if God is willing"" when he hung up. At the end of the ordeal, Makhzoomi says an agent told him that Southwest would not be able to fly him back to Oakland, and suggested he apologize. ""My dignity comes first. I will just get my refund and leave,"" Makhzoomi told the agent. He ended up catching a later flight back with Delta Air Lines.Southwest told The Huffington Post in a statement:Prior to the departure of Flight 4620, our Crew made the decision to investigate a passenger report of potentially threatening comments overheard onboard our aircraft. Our Employees followed protocol by reviewing the situation with the passenger in question, as it is the responsibility of our Employees to respond to Customer concerns. While local law enforcement followed up with that passenger in our gate area, the flight departed.But Makhzoomi just wants Southwest to say they're sorry.""I want Southwest to apologize publicly,"" he said. ""I want them to apologize for the mistreatment, and how they singled me out, that they cannot report anyone without consequences. This is a country that respects the rule of law, and we must all together respect the rule of law.""Last week, a Muslim woman was reportedly kicked off her Southwest flight during a layover in Chicago after asking to switch seats. For Makhzoomi, who says terrorism thrives on Islamophobia, this is not the way to fight terrorism.""I only hate one thing in my life: Islamic State,"" he said. ""We should challenge terrorism not with ignorance but with education and knowledge."""

The rig, explains Engadget, has specific hardware “that makes all six cameras operate as one.” When the footage from the cameras are stitched together, a single 360-degree video will be created.The GoPro Omni, including the six cameras, rig, memory cards, Kolor editing software and other accouterments, will be selling for $4,999. The rig alone costs $1,500.The company will also be introducing GoPro VR, a content-sharing website and free app platform for iOS and Android that will host GoPro VR video content.This December preview video shows the kind of footage that we might expect on the new platform:This isn’t GoPro’s first foray into the VR market. Last year, the company unveiled the GoPro Odyssey, an elaborate $15,000 16-camera VR rig.The Odyssey, however, is currently invite only and it remains unclear as to when it'll be available to a wider market. (Earlier this month, GoPro promised “more Odyssey news soon,” though it didn’t elaborate as to why the device’s release has been delayed.)Expectations are running high for GoPro's new VR offerings.Though Samsung's VR platform, Milk VR, has been around for almost a year and a half, and there are several consumer-level 360-degree cameras on the market, no company or product has emerged dominant thus far, and VR remains a relatively niche technology.""GoPro's mainstream footprint, and focus on capturing outdoor activities from skateboarding to surfing, could be just the thing to jumpstart a truly robust VR content sharing platform,"" Mashable wrote this week. GoPro VR will launch and the Omni will be available for pre-order on Monday. "

According to this short history of admissions snafus compiled by Time, that embarrassing honor goes to the University of California, San Diego, which mistakenly emailed acceptance letters to 28,000 students in 2009, only to deny them with a second email hours later."

Pat Schroeder was one of 31 women in Congress -- there were two in the Senate and 29 in the House. It was also the month when Anita Hill was called to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual harassment she said she had experienced while working under then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.If it wasn't for the persistence of Schroeder and a handful of her fellow female colleagues, Hill may never have been allowed to tell her story directly to the committee. On October 9, 1991, Schroeder and five other Congresswomen were photographed charging up the stairs of the U.S. Senate, to confront their male Democratic colleagues. The image was published in the New York Times -- and it is a powerful one. (Head here to see it.) This event was also portrayed in a scene during HBO's ""Confirmation,"" which aired Saturday April 16. Late '91 would also come to be seen as a turning point for women's representation in government. The next election year, 1992, was dubbed the “Year of the Woman.” Four more women were elected to the Senate and the percentage of women in the House rose above 10 percent for the first time.In advance of ""Confirmation,"" The Huffington Post reached out to Schroeder, who retired from Congress in 1997. She spoke candidly about what it was like to challenge her fellow (male) Democrats, her prior experiences with Thomas, and why it's so damn important to have women represented in the U.S. government. You were one of the Congresswomen who was really vocal and pushed for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow Anita Hill to testify in 1991. Can you talk a bit about what that was like?It was awful. We were trying to get through to the Senators to say, “What is going on? Why aren’t you going to let this woman testify?” They really weren't paying much attention. We had organized a group of us [women in the House] to give one-minute speeches at the beginning of the session about it in the House. And then we said, “You know what? It’s Wednesday and the Senate Democrats meet for lunch, so lets just walk over there and go in and talk to them about it, face to face.""So, we went over there and knocked on the door. Senator Mitchell, who was then the Senate Majority Leader, came and said, “Oh, we can’t let strangers in here.” And we kind of lost it. We said, “Strangers, what do you mean? We’re your colleagues on the other side.” And then we said, “There’s all this media behind us, should we go tell them?” He was quick enough to know that was not a good thing, so he said, “Come back this afternoon to my office and talk to me.” So we made an appointment, we all went back and talked to him, and he in the interim had gotten a hold of Joe Biden, who was then Chair of Judiciary. And Biden had told him that he had promised Jack Danforth, the senator from Missouri, in the gym, that the hearings would be quick and they’d move right along. [Laughs.] We were like, “Really? These kind of deals are made in the gym? Well isn’t that nice.” Meanwhile, the world was out here saying, “What is going on?”So what transpired then was this big compromise that they would let Anita Hill testify, but they put her on early in the morning, and the other woman [Angela Wright] that had come forward wasn't allowed to testify. And they ramrodded [Thomas' nomination] through. I think if the vote had been a couple hours later, I think we would have totally won it, because it was very very close. There's a very famous photo of you, Barbara Boxer, Nita Lowey, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jolene Unsoeld and Patsy Mink from October '91. You're all marching up the stairs to the Senate. How did that photo come about?So in the House, the press are up on the balcony. We said, well, gee we’re gonna walk over to the Senate. And the press followed us over! In a way, it was one of those incredible change moments for an awful lot of women who sat their and said, “Wait a minute. All these progressive men on this panel are sitting there sucking their thumbs! I mean, they’re in a fetal position! They aren’t able to deal at all!” And one of the best things we got out of it was two women senators out of California. And we got a lot of women elected that year. I think we got up to a whole 10 percent [women in the House], which was just incredible. I remember as they were swearing [the women representatives] in, an old guy came up to me and said, “Well I hope you’re happy. This place looks like a shopping mall.” [And I thought], “Where do you shop?” So, it was a testy time.Obviously, Hill’s testimony didn’t stop Thomas from being confirmed, but do you feel that it shifted the conversation in the country around sexual harassment?Absolutely. Seeing people who had been the lions of the Civil Rights movement, like [former Massachusetts senator] Ted Kennedy and [former Illinois senator] Paul Simon, just melt down on this. And it’s kind of like, “Excuse me. Don’t we count?”The other thing, to be honest, is that [former Congresswoman from New York] Geraldine Ferraro and [former Congresswoman from Ohio] Mary Rose Oakar and I each had subcommittees. And we had put our three committees together and had a series of hearings when Clarence Thomas was head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC. [Editor's note: Thomas was head of the EEOC from 1982 to 1990, and Anita Hill worked under him from 1982 to 1983.] And of course Thomas came in and was just so arrogant. He was like, “Equal pay? That’s the stupidest thing I ever heard of,” and on and on and on. He was always so dismissive of us, and the hearings were just awful. So we didn’t like him. A group of us had had a lot of experience with him, and that was probably one of the reasons we took Hill's testimony very seriously. Because he just came in and treated us like we were snotty little kids.So, you had the feeling that he didn’t have the greatest attitude towards women.Absolutely. [Laughs.] Yes.Do you feel the Thomas confirmation hearings brought a greater awareness to the lack of gender and racial diversity in the Senate?Absolutely. I remember when Barbara Mikulski ran the first time for the Senate [in 1986], sitting down by her on the floor one day, and she just looked exhausted. And she said, “I am so tired of women saying to me, ‘Why are you running for the Senate? We have a good man running.’” And they did, they had a progressive male running. And I think for a lot of women, that was the attitude. Women would only run if there was absolutely nobody else to do it. And this whole idea that you would run against a “good man.” How could you do that? We only run against ""bad guys""! Well, she [Mikulski] won anyway, thank goodness. But I think all of a sudden, during Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearings, women saw these guys that they had all defined as “good men” not looking so good when it came to women’s issues. This is the reason we want women in Congress. I mean, even progressive men can be sexists.Yes, they caaaaan. [In a sing-song voice]Looking back, how do you think things have changed since 1991? Have we made progress?Well, I think we still have a lot further to go. I don’t know, I don’t have a meter to measure it. One of the things I found when I was in Congress was that when I would talk about sexism, young women would say, “Oh my mom talks about that,” or “My grandma talks about that, but life is different now.” And I think Title IX -- thank goodness -- has done so much in opening education, that a lot of these young women think everything’s just fine. And then they’d get to be about 25 to 30, and they’d show up at my office and say, “You know what happened to me?” [Laughs wryly.] “Yeah, well, welcome to the club.” Title IX doesn’t go beyond school, and unfortunately, the world hasn’t changed all that much."

He exited his cruiser and confronted David Joseph, who was completely naked and standing in the middle of the street.After just seconds of verbal contact, Joseph, a 17-year-old known to his friends as Pronto, lay dying on the asphalt. Freeman had shot him through the heart.Medical examiners would officially describe Joseph as African-American, 5 feet 7 inches tall and 146 pounds. Freeman, 46 years old and also black, stood at the same height, but was nearly 100 pounds heavier than the teen. A toxicology report later found traces of marijuana, the prescription drug Xanax and an antihistamine in Joseph's system. It's still unclear what drove him to strip off his clothes and run around the neighborhood.Joseph is one of the nearly 300 people police have shot and killed so far this year, according to The Washington Post's unofficial tally. And like the rest of the names on that list, you're probably not familiar with Joseph or his story.There was no mention of Joseph on CNN, Fox News or MSNBC on the day he died, or on any day since, according to a Huffington Post review of programming. Instead, cable news gleefully reported that Donald Trump had called his Republican opponent Texas Sen. Ted Cruz a ""pussy."" The schoolyard insult prompted numerous segments, including ""experts"" speculating on whether the billionaire's vulgarity would sink his candidacy. (It didn't.)There have been at least 20 cases in which cops have shot unarmed civilians to death this year, and a HuffPost examination of cable news transcripts found that the major cable news networks have not covered any of them. ""I have yet to speak with a single person — on 10 college campuses — who has correctly identified"" any of the victims, Shaun King, an activist and criminal justice reporter for the New York Daily News, wrote in a column earlier this month. ""The hashtags and trending topics of police brutality victims that were once a staple from coast to coast have all but disappeared.""Although the media's interest in police shootings may have changed, the broad outlines of many of the cases haven't. According to Freeman, Joseph didn't comply with his commands to stop, and instead turned and charged. Freeman claimed he feared for his life and had to resort to lethal force, even though he was also equipped with a Taser, pepper spray and a baton. Joseph's family said the teen needed help, not a bullet to the chest.Similar accounts fueled controversy in Ferguson, Missouri, as well as other cities including New York City, Baltimore, Minneapolis and Chicago over the past two years. And like those cases, Joseph's shooting raises many of the same questions about law enforcement's use of force, training, racial biases and the ability to hold officers accountable for catastrophic misjudgment or misconduct.Unlike in those cases, however, Joseph has not become a household name or part of a rallying cry in the fight against police violence.And he's not alone in his relative anonymity. Although police reform is still on many people's minds -- including the journalists who continue to cover it -- mainstream reporting on the issue seems to have shifted away from telling the stories behind the climbing death toll.Instead, the media has turned its sights to the heated presidential election, burning through the oxygen that had given life to stories about police brutality and reform.“The election has distracted people and, even worse, the media has just given in to the lowest common denominator to cover every crazy and outrageous thing Trump says at the expense of actually covering issues and concerns,” Sarah Oates, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland, told HuffPost.It's not that wall-to-wall coverage of the presidential election has completely undercut the conversation about policing in America. Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have both reached out to the families of victims of police violence, even recruiting some of them as surrogates. And they've both made sweeping -- though perhaps unrealistic -- promises to enact police reform if elected president. But in the midst of a contentious primary season, they've stopped using new examples to illustrate the critical importance of the issue.The focus was less abstract last year. Police fatally shot 109 unarmed civilians in 2015, according to The Guardian's unofficial tally, a steady drumbeat of bloodshed accentuated by higher-profile incidents that dominated headlines for days. National attention helped amplify the existing local activism, and under the klieg lights, city and state officials felt pressure to listen to the demands for accountability, transparency and change.Video footage played an integral role in building that storyline. Last year, the public had little choice but to watch as bystander video of an officer opening fire on a fleeing 50-year-old Walter Scott was broadcast on repeat around the nation. In the days that passed between the Scott shooting and the release of the footage, law enforcement tried to portray the incident as a reasonable use of force. The four-minute cell phone video unwound that narrative, and eventually led prosecutors to charge the officer with murder.In the cases from this year that HuffPost analyzed, however, there have so far been no publicly released videos clearly showing the shootings -- no visual evidence to further force Americans to take a hard look at police violence and potentially challenge the notion that officers are always right. And considering that police are still killing people frequently -- in incidents that often sound troublingly familiar -- it's possible that the public has developed a higher threshold for outrage.While Clinton and Sanders have been less outspoken about issues of police violence this year, they didn't hesitate to get involved last year. In fact, both candidates appeared to make a point of saying the names of people killed by police, channeling a cause promoted by activists aligned with the Black Lives Matter movement.But now that Clinton and Sanders are trying to win over voters and build their national appeal, Oates says they're taking a more delicate approach.“It allows them to get some votes hopefully without alienating the white majority,"" she said of the candidates' overtures on police reform. ""They’re kind of stuck between people who don’t ever want to hear the police criticized and people who really want to say there’s a real problem with the power that’s given to police versus the rights of the citizens.”This shift can't be chalked up entirely to a campaign-obsessed media that thrives on vapid political coverage. If there's one upside to this trend, it's that police are so far killing fewer unarmed people this year than they were in 2015. But we're just months into 2016, and we've still seen a number of disturbing incidents that under different circumstances, might have resonated beyond the local level.Take the case of Antronie Scott, a 36-year-old black man who was shot and killed by San Antonio Police Officer John Lee in February, just days before Joseph's fatal shooting. Lee found Scott, who was wanted on two felony charges, sitting in the parking lot of his girlfriend’s apartment complex. According to Lee, Scott made a sudden turn after he stepped out of his car. Lee says he thought he saw a gun. It was a cell phone. Activists in San Antonio held rallies calling for justice, but Scott’s story still failed to permeate the national news cycle. Mike Lowe, a local Black Lives Matter activist, attributes part of this to the fact that the demonstrations there were less disruptive than major protests in Ferguson, Baltimore and Chicago. “A lot of individuals may not be rebellious or have that spirit of protest in them to be like, ‘We’re just going to occupy the streets until justice happens,’” he said.Those more confrontational attitudes have paid dividends in other cities, Lowe said. But he says politicians in San Antonio take pride in the fact that the city isn't like its peers. After Scott’s shooting, Mayor Ivy Taylor, who is black, said in a statement that it was important for San Antonio to not compare itself -- and the killing of Scott -- to what has happened elsewhere. “Every city or town also has its own context,"" she said. ""I will not allow our city’s story to be that of cities we see on the national news.""“Politicizing this incident and putting it in the context of what’s happening in other cities is not the solution -- just as reverting to 20th-century police techniques or protesting the very meetings that seek to provide the opportunity for constructive dialogue is not the solution,” Taylor added.The mayor sat down with activists to discuss their concerns, and San Antonio's chief of police said in early March that Lee would be fired. Weeks later, however, he reversed course, saying Lee would face no disciplinary action beyond additional training. Taylor quickly announced that she supported his decision.The local media landscape has also contributed to the obscurity of many of these cases. Small, often underresourced newsrooms are more likely to prioritize pro-police narratives, which helps explain why their coverage sometimes tends to be linear and uncritical of law enforcement, Oates said. “You have to build a relationship with the local officials as a reporter. You have to make decisions about which bridges to burn,” she said. “And I’d love to say it doesn’t work that way, but ask any local reporter and they’ll tell you, you’ve got to pick your battles.” That could be one reason you probably haven't heard about 25-year-old Kelsey Hauser, who was killed in January by an El Cajon, California, police officer. She was sitting in the passenger seat of a stolen car that was reportedly accelerating toward an officer. Or Calin Roquemore, a 24-year-old killed in February by a state trooper in Beckville, Texas, after exiting his car and trying to flee on foot following a brief chase. Or Cristian Medina, a mentally ill 23-year-old fatally shot in Florence, California, last month after he reportedly pointed his finger at officers like a gun.All of these individuals were unarmed. And despite concerning details about the circumstances of these shootings, they've received only perfunctory coverage from local outlets and none from national sources. The media isn't asking hard questions of the police, which likely means nobody else is either. Victims' families are then left to trust that law enforcement will properly handle issues of transparency and accountability on their own, absent outside pressure.The apparent apathy surrounding new police shooting cases could reflect a lack of interest in the community or in the newsroom itself, or it could simply come down to the downsizing of local media. “You just don't have the ability sometimes to cover the basic facts, much less anything more than what the police department tells you,” Oates said, recalling her time as the lone reporter covering crime for the Orlando Sentinel in the 1980s. “It’s really down to the better-resourced media organization to take the bigger picture, gather up the data and try to shift the national agenda on things.” Lowe agreed with Oates that the presence of national media is often vital in these cases -- especially in helping activists in the community achieve their goal of police accountability. “Once it gets national attention, it’s like, OK, the world is watching,” he said.A month and a half after Joseph's death, Austin's police chief, Art Acevedo, announced that Freeman had been ""indefinitely suspended"" from the department. ""Officer Freeman chose to confront Mr. Joseph alone [and] ... chose to utilize deadly force to Mr. Joseph, even though he knew other officers had yet to arrive but were imminently in route,"" read a memo from Acevedo. ""Freeman's decision to draw his weapon when he exited his vehicle was unwarranted. … There were no extenuating circumstances why he could not maintain a safe distance while keeping Mr. Joseph in view.""Matthew Simpson, a policy strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union in Texas who works on issues of police misconduct, says there could be an upside to the fact that Joseph's case didn't get more national attention. While Austin has handled previous controversial police shootings poorly, city officials worked proactively to address the community's anxiety and anger over Joseph's killing. They formed a coalition of concerned parties, solicited input from activists and proceeded in a timely and relatively transparent manner to keep the public informed about the case. It seemed like they might have been listening to the message the Black Lives Matter movement has been sending.""It's not as interesting a story if there's misconduct and the police actually handle it appropriately,"" Simpson said. ""It sort of proves that if individual officers who are bad actors are held accountable, the community is willing to acknowledge that.""It's still unclear if Freeman will face criminal charges for the shooting. Last month, he filed an appeal to keep his job."

And considering that police are still killing people frequently -- in incidents that often sound troublingly familiar -- it's possible that the public has developed a higher threshold for outrage.While Clinton and Sanders have been less outspoken about issues of police violence this year, they didn't hesitate to get involved last year. In fact, both candidates appeared to make a point of saying the names of people killed by police, channeling a cause promoted by activists aligned with the Black Lives Matter movement.But now that Clinton and Sanders are trying to win over voters and build their national appeal, Oates says they're taking a more delicate approach.“It allows them to get some votes hopefully without alienating the white majority,"" she said of the candidates' overtures on police reform. ""They’re kind of stuck between people who don’t ever want to hear the police criticized and people who really want to say there’s a real problem with the power that’s given to police versus the rights of the citizens.”This shift can't be chalked up entirely to a campaign-obsessed media that thrives on vapid political coverage. If there's one upside to this trend, it's that police are so far killing fewer unarmed people this year than they were in 2015. But we're just months into 2016, and we've still seen a number of disturbing incidents that under different circumstances, might have resonated beyond the local level.Take the case of Antronie Scott, a 36-year-old black man who was shot and killed by San Antonio Police Officer John Lee in February, just days before Joseph's fatal shooting. Lee found Scott, who was wanted on two felony charges, sitting in the parking lot of his girlfriend’s apartment complex. According to Lee, Scott made a sudden turn after he stepped out of his car. Lee says he thought he saw a gun. It was a cell phone. Activists in San Antonio held rallies calling for justice, but Scott’s story still failed to permeate the national news cycle. Mike Lowe, a local Black Lives Matter activist, attributes part of this to the fact that the demonstrations there were less disruptive than major protests in Ferguson, Baltimore and Chicago. “A lot of individuals may not be rebellious or have that spirit of protest in them to be like, ‘We’re just going to occupy the streets until justice happens,’” he said.Those more confrontational attitudes have paid dividends in other cities, Lowe said. But he says politicians in San Antonio take pride in the fact that the city isn't like its peers. After Scott’s shooting, Mayor Ivy Taylor, who is black, said in a statement that it was important for San Antonio to not compare itself -- and the killing of Scott -- to what has happened elsewhere. “Every city or town also has its own context,"" she said. ""I will not allow our city’s story to be that of cities we see on the national news.""“Politicizing this incident and putting it in the context of what’s happening in other cities is not the solution -- just as reverting to 20th-century police techniques or protesting the very meetings that seek to provide the opportunity for constructive dialogue is not the solution,” Taylor added.The mayor sat down with activists to discuss their concerns, and San Antonio's chief of police said in early March that Lee would be fired. Weeks later, however, he reversed course, saying Lee would face no disciplinary action beyond additional training. Taylor quickly announced that she supported his decision.The local media landscape has also contributed to the obscurity of many of these cases. Small, often underresourced newsrooms are more likely to prioritize pro-police narratives, which helps explain why their coverage sometimes tends to be linear and uncritical of law enforcement, Oates said. “You have to build a relationship with the local officials as a reporter. You have to make decisions about which bridges to burn,” she said. “And I’d love to say it doesn’t work that way, but ask any local reporter and they’ll tell you, you’ve got to pick your battles.” That could be one reason you probably haven't heard about 25-year-old Kelsey Hauser, who was killed in January by an El Cajon, California, police officer. She was sitting in the passenger seat of a stolen car that was reportedly accelerating toward an officer. Or Calin Roquemore, a 24-year-old killed in February by a state trooper in Beckville, Texas, after exiting his car and trying to flee on foot following a brief chase. Or Cristian Medina, a mentally ill 23-year-old fatally shot in Florence, California, last month after he reportedly pointed his finger at officers like a gun.All of these individuals were unarmed. And despite concerning details about the circumstances of these shootings, they've received only perfunctory coverage from local outlets and none from national sources. The media isn't asking hard questions of the police, which likely means nobody else is either. Victims' families are then left to trust that law enforcement will properly handle issues of transparency and accountability on their own, absent outside pressure.The apparent apathy surrounding new police shooting cases could reflect a lack of interest in the community or in the newsroom itself, or it could simply come down to the downsizing of local media. “You just don't have the ability sometimes to cover the basic facts, much less anything more than what the police department tells you,” Oates said, recalling her time as the lone reporter covering crime for the Orlando Sentinel in the 1980s. “It’s really down to the better-resourced media organization to take the bigger picture, gather up the data and try to shift the national agenda on things.” Lowe agreed with Oates that the presence of national media is often vital in these cases -- especially in helping activists in the community achieve their goal of police accountability. “Once it gets national attention, it’s like, OK, the world is watching,” he said.A month and a half after Joseph's death, Austin's police chief, Art Acevedo, announced that Freeman had been ""indefinitely suspended"" from the department. ""Officer Freeman chose to confront Mr. Joseph alone [and] ... chose to utilize deadly force to Mr. Joseph, even though he knew other officers had yet to arrive but were imminently in route,"" read a memo from Acevedo. ""Freeman's decision to draw his weapon when he exited his vehicle was unwarranted. … There were no extenuating circumstances why he could not maintain a safe distance while keeping Mr. Joseph in view.""Matthew Simpson, a policy strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union in Texas who works on issues of police misconduct, says there could be an upside to the fact that Joseph's case didn't get more national attention. While Austin has handled previous controversial police shootings poorly, city officials worked proactively to address the community's anxiety and anger over Joseph's killing. They formed a coalition of concerned parties, solicited input from activists and proceeded in a timely and relatively transparent manner to keep the public informed about the case. It seemed like they might have been listening to the message the Black Lives Matter movement has been sending.""It's not as interesting a story if there's misconduct and the police actually handle it appropriately,"" Simpson said. ""It sort of proves that if individual officers who are bad actors are held accountable, the community is willing to acknowledge that.""It's still unclear if Freeman will face criminal charges for the shooting. Last month, he filed an appeal to keep his job."

Some Israelis who live on the Gaza frontier believe militants are digging fresh tunnels and worry the counter-measures will come too late.The tunnel made public on Monday was discovered days earlier but kept under wraps by Israel as it probed what it said were hundreds of meters (yards) of shafts on the Israeli side of the border near southeast Gaza. The network was then razed.""We have neutralized the tunnel in Israeli territory, rendering it unusable for infiltration by Hamas terrorists,"" said Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner, a military spokesman.Asked how the tunnel was discovered, he declined to give specifics, citing only ""a combination of technology, intelligence, engineering capabilities and boots on the ground"".""We estimate that this tunnel was mostly built after Protective Edge,"" Lerner said, using Israel's term for the Gaza war, during which it lost 12 soldiers to Hamas gunmen who burrowed across the border on four occasions.Hamas, which has largely held fire since the war, implicitly claimed the tunnel as its own.""What the enemy announced is only a drop in the sea of what the resistance has prepared to defend its people and liberate its sacred sites, its land and its prisoners,"" Hamas's armed wing, Izz el-Deen Al-Qassam, said in a statement.Israel has signaled the mere existence of a tunnel - as opposed to its use for an attack - may not be a casus belli.""We do not seek conflict, but if Hamas tries to provoke the State of Israel and disrupt the lives of residents of the Gaza periphery communities, it will be dealt a very strong blow,"" Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon said in a statement on Monday.The Gaza war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians and devastated parts of the enclave. Gaza medical sources and U.N. officials say most were civilians, a figure disputed by Israel, which lost 67 troops and six civilians to the fighting.The Gaza periphery is now mostly quiet, except for occasional Palestinian rocket attacks Israel says were carried out by Islamist groups that view Hamas as too lenient.Despite the apparent role of Israeli technology in discovering the tunnel, officials say a more reliable counter-measure, comparable to the Iron Dome interceptor for rockets, is still not in place.(Additional reporting by Jeffrey Heller and Nidal al-Mughrabi; Editing by Mark Heinrich)"

Besides China's territorial claims in the area, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Taiwan have rival claims.(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Simon Cameron-Moore)"

Prosecutors, citing the testimony from the soldier's comrades and his apparently calm disposition, see it as an illegal shooting motivated by revenge.Azaria was initially held on a murder warrant. The lighter manslaughter charge, reflecting a view that the killing was not premeditated, could spell a jail term of up to 20 years.""The terrorist ... was left lying on the ground, still alive, and did not present any immediate and tangible danger to the civilians and soldiers around him,"" the indictment said.It said Azaria handed his helmet to a comrade, cocked his rifle, walked a few steps towards the Palestinian and ""fired one bullet at the terrorist's head,"" killing him.Such action, the charge sheet said, violated rules of engagement and had no ""operational justification.""An opinion poll last month found 57 percent of Israelis think Azaria should never been arrested. His supporters, including some rightist politicians, have demonstrated for his release. Almost 60,000 people have signed an online petition demanding that he be decorated for heroism.Azaria's family, who according to a person familiar with the case hold dual French citizenship, and supporters planned to hold a rally of support in a main square in Tel Aviv on Tuesday.Two popular Israeli singers initially said they would perform at the gathering but later withdrew, saying they feared the event would have political overtones and be seen as a protest against military authorities.The outcry over the Hebron incident has flagged up rare rifts over the role and ethics of Israel's conscript armed forces, long the symbol of unity among the majority Jews where deep concern about security is largely shared across the social and political spectrum.(Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Jeffrey Heller and Richard Balmforth)"

On Monday, at the Future Transport Summit in Sydney, Australia, Wozniak denounced the ride-hailing company's disputed labor practices and critiqued what he sees as its monopolistic ambitions, according to Mashable. ""Like a lot of people, I have some distrust of Uber and how their drivers don't really realize at first that they aren't making much money, maybe losing money on the wear and tear of their cars,"" Wozniak told reporters at the summit. ""That's how I think of Uber: Not very nice thoughts,” Wozniak added. David Rohrsheim, general manager of Uber in Australia, responded to Wozniak’s remarks by noting that Uber drivers have a job with rare flexibility. ""It has to be a good deal for partners or otherwise they won't use the platform,"" Rorhsheim told Mashable Australia. Wozniak isn't alone in criticizing the app. Class-action lawsuits filed by Uber drivers in California and Michigan argue that the company wrongly classifies its workers as independent contractors, allowing it to drive down their wages and withhold benefits. As contractors, drivers are exempt from minimum wage requirements and don't receive certain state and federal benefits. Both lawsuits contend that Uber drivers are, in fact, employees, a designation that comes with greater labor protectionsWozniak added that he'd prefer to use Lyft from now on. Lyft, which is Uber's main competitor in the U.S., agreed in January to expand benefits for drivers. Lyft drivers can no longer be fired at will and have the right to settle termination and pay disputes through arbitration. Despite those gains, Lyft drivers, like Uber drivers, are still considered independent contractors.Wozniak told reporters he’d also like to see more competition in the ride-sharing market. ""I would rather there be a lot of competitive forces,” Wozniak said. “I'd like there to be four or five choice that are like Uber anywhere you go.""The Woz might get his wish. Several new ride-sharing services are scheduled to hit roads soon. Chariot for Women, which launches Tuesday, is an alternative ride-sharing service with all-women drivers, exclusively for women. Another service, Juno, hopes to become Uber’s mirror opposite. It’s drivers will not only have employee status, but will also get equity in the company, in addition to several other perks. Despite his concerns about Uber, overall, Wozniak isn’t too worried about the sorts of economic changes Uber represents. ""You might come up with a new technology and some old jobs disappear and there are robots building cars,"" he said. ""Well, the jobs pop up somewhere else. The economy just shifts, it moves."""

The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or BEAM, is scheduled to be inflated with air in late May, beginning a two-year experiment to see how it holds up in the harsh environment of space.Made of impact-resistant, Kevlar-like materials and other fabrics, the lightweight habitats could save millions of dollars in launch costs compared with metal modules. They may also offer better radiation protection for astronauts, officials with NASA and Bigelow Aerospace said before the April 8 launch.Bigelow, based in North Las Vegas, Nevada, tested two unmanned prototypes a decade ago, but BEAM is its first inflatable that will host astronauts.The company is developing time-share agreements to lease space aboard the module to commercial entities, research organizations and the occasional space tourist."

In an interview with Lewandowski on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Chris Wallace gave him the opportunity to publicly apologize to Fields, noting that she could still file a civil lawsuit if she wanted to. ""In the interest of avoiding unnecessary litigation, which I know Republicans don't like, are you prepared here and now to apologize to Ms. Fields for touching her and for saying that she was delusioned?""

Many in the GOP hold similar sentiments to the Republican lobbyist Ed Rogers, who told CNN in December that ""compared to Trump, he's OK.""But if you run a business, are employed by one, care about the stability of the financial system, or would prefer that the U.S. economy not be needlessly thrown into disarray -- a group that seems like a pretty broad coalition of voters -- Cruz’s economic policy is not OK.He told CNBC on Friday that he wants to push America back to the gold standard. This is a hare-brained policy that no other country uses and not a single surveyed economist thinks is a good idea. Under the gold standard, a dollar is worth a certain amount of gold. That’s great, you might think: the value of the dollar will be stable. But the exact opposite is true; gold is a commodity and its price, driven by supply and demand and speculation, swings wildly. Under the gold standard, a central bank like the Federal Reserve would have to raise and cut interest rates not based on how well the economy is doing, but what’s going on in the gold market. It’s a good way to run a modern economy into the ground. (The inflexibility of the gold standard caused the Great Depression.)And yet Cruz thinks the gold standard is a great policy.The Cruz campaign did not respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post.He expressed support for this very dangerous idea at Republican debates in October and November, too. “We had it for about 170 years of our nation’s history, and enjoyed booming economic growth and lower inflation than we have had with the Fed now,"" Cruz said. ""We need to get back to sound money.” But that’s not really true. As Matt O’Brien wrote in the Atlantic, it “was a time of more frequent recessions, more protracted recessions, and more severe recessions. In other words, the bad old days.”If that's the American economy you want, Ted Cruz has the policy to deliver it."

35,THE WORLDPOST,Brazil's Congress Set To Vote On President Rouseff's Impeachment,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brazil-rousseff-impeachment_us_57139415e4b06f35cb6fd45b,The vote is a crucial step towards a potential impeachment.,2016-04-17,"Overview of the Brazilian National Congress' Lower House, where the admissibility of the impeachment request of President Dilma Rousseff will be voted in Brasilia on April 17, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5713953b1900002d0056b65f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BRASILIA, April 17 (Reuters) - Brazil's lower house of Congress will decide on Sunday whether to recommend impeaching President Dilma Rousseff on charges of manipulating budgetary accounts, in a vote that could hasten the end of 13 years of leftist Workers Party rule.The political crisis, which comes amid Brazil's worst recession since the 1930s, has deeply divided the South American country and sparked an acrimonious fight between Rousseff and her Vice President Michel Temer, who would take over if she is dismissed.In a frenzied round of last-minute deal-making Rousseff appeared to be clawing back the votes of some wavering lawmakers but polls showed the leader still lacks the one-third of votes needed in the 513-seat lower house to avoid being sent for trial in the Senate.Rousseff's charismatic predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has been leading the deal-making to keep her in office and drafted in governors from several states to pressure legislators on Saturday, swinging momentum back in Rousseff's favor.""The governors' participation is proving decisive,"" said Paulo Teixeira, one of the Workers' Party's leaders in the lower house.On Sunday morning, pro- and anti-impeachment protesters gathered before making their way to the grassy esplanade in front of Congress. There a 2-meter (6.5-foot) high wall has been erected stretching for more than 1 km (0.6 of a mile) to separate both sides, a symbol of the stark political divide in one of the world's most unequal societies.Buses carrying some of the thousands of police being deployed in the capital Brasilia were arriving and officers getting into position. Further protests are expected in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with hundreds of thousands of demonstrators from both sides taking to the streets before voting starts at 2 pm (1700 GMT). The vote is expected to run into Sunday evening.Polls suggest more than 60 percent of Brazil's 200 million people support impeaching Rousseff, whose inner circle has been tainted by a vast corruption scandal at state oil company Petrobras.The Workers Party, however, still musters strong support among millions of working class Brazilians, who credit its welfare programs with pulling their families out of poverty during the last decade.PARALYSED GOVERNMENTThe impeachment crisis has paralyzed activity in Brasilia, just four months before the country is due to host the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, and as it seeks to battle an epidemic of the Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects in newborns.While Rousseff herself has not been personally charged with corruption, many of the lawmakers who will decide her fate on Sunday have.Congresso em Foco, a prominent watchdog group in Brasilia, says more than 300 of the legislators who will vote on Sunday - well over half the chamber - are under investigation for corruption, fraud or electoral crimes.If Rousseff loses Sunday's vote, the Senate must decide whether there are legal grounds to hear the case against her, a decision expected in early May.Should it agree to do so, Rousseff would be suspended from office and Temer would automatically take over.Financial markets in Brazil have rallied strongly in recent weeks on hopes that Rousseff's dismissal would usher in a more business-friendly Temer administration. Sources close to the vice president told Reuters on Friday he was considering a senior executive at Goldman Sachs in Brazil for a top economic post.Whoever governs the country in the coming months, however, will inherit a toxic political environment, a deeply divided Congress, rising unemployment and an expected contraction of four percent this year in the world's ninth largest economy."

The hit featured such ethically questionable lyrics as ""Just let me rock, fuck you back to sleep girl / Don't say a word no (no, don't you talk)."" Since its release, the song has racked up over 37 million views on YouTube and spent 12 weeks on Billboard's Top 100. Sunday afternoon, Best Coast, the singer-songwriter whose real name is Bethany Cosentino, railed against Brown's lyrics on Twitter, saying the song ""perpetuates rape culture.""Cosentino criticized the song's message against consensual sex but also lamented the fact it slipped by record industry decision-makers to win a place on Brown's album ""Royalty,"" named for his young daughter. ""People learn from music, they learn from popular culture,"" the singer tweeted. While she called out the song's ongoing popularity, she noted that her criticism wasn't limited to Brown. Among other artists, Robin Thicke certainly caused a stir with his massive 2013 hit ""Blurred Lines,"" which suggested that permission is somehow a gray area. Justin Bieber's 2015 hit ""What Do You Mean"" got flack for similar messaging.Read Cosentino's take below:This isn't the first time Cosentino has written about the culture of sexism in music. In a February essay in Lenny Letter, she voiced support for the women who have accused music publicist Heathcliff Berru of sexual harassment -- Cosentino herself had previously alleged Berru harassed her -- and called out gendered criticism in news and social media. ""People need to stop calling me a 'whiny baby' because I write songs about heartache and my feelings,"" she wrote. ""Did anyone call The Beatles 'whiny babies' for singing the lyrics 'This boy wants you back again'?"" Never change, Bethany Cosentino."
