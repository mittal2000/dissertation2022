2,MEDIA,The New York Times Calls For $15 Minimum Wage Nationwide,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-times-15-minimum-wage_us_5681474de4b014efe0d8a7ef,"The paper of record's editorial is unlikely to move Congress to act, but it is a high-profile boost for the ""Fight for $15"" movement.",2015-12-28,"People attend the strike in support of a $15-per-hour minimum wage in New York City on Nov. 10, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5681490a1f00000601e9c8c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The New York Times called on Congress to pass a national minimum wage of $15 an hour in an editorial Saturday.“Sooner or later, Congress has to set an adequate wage floor for the nation as a whole,” the paper’s editorial board wrote. “If it does so in the near future, the new minimum should be $15.”The $15 minimum wage has gained steam primarily at the local level in the past two years, beginning with SeaTac, Washington, in 2013. As the Times notes, the $15 minimum is now being phased in in Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles County, transforming it from “a slogan to a benchmark.”That transformation is due in no small part to the agitation of the fast-food worker-led “Fight for $15,” which began in New York City in November 2012. The campaign, backed by the large service sector union SEIU, has generated national attention with increasingly large one-day walkouts and protests demanding $15 an hour and a union.The New York Times’ endorsement arrives at a momentous time for the Fight for $15. In 2016, five states and nine cities will decide whether to adopt a $15 minimum, the editorial board observes.But the Times argues that nothing short of an act of Congress will suffice since 21 states have not even raised their minimum wages above the federal floor of $7.25 an hour.Congress is highly unlikely to pass a $15 minimum wage. Senate Democrats have embraced a bill that would raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) has solicited support for increasing the bill’s proposal to $12 an hour.Regardless, Republicans in both chambers of Congress have blocked the bill enacting even a $10.10 minimum.Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley have both called for a nationwide minimum wage of $15 an hour.Hillary Clinton, the putative Democratic front-runner, has rejected a national $15 minimum, saying it might be appropriate in some cities and states, but not nationwide.Clinton has cited as support for her position a New York Times op-ed by the liberal Princeton economist Alan Krueger claiming that a national $15 minimum wage would risk creating job loss in some parts of the country.Also on HuffPost:"

6,POLITICS,The Sanders-Clinton Spat Over Middle-Class Taxes Is About A Lot More Than Money,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-middle-class-taxes_us_567dacc7e4b06fa6888029d7,Just ask FDR.,2015-12-28,"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton disagreed strongly over taxes at the Democratic presidential debate at Saint Anselm College on Dec. 19, 2015, in Manchester, New Hampshire.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/567dae101f0000c000e9c83c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the most substantive exchanges in the Democratic presidential debate on Dec. 19 occurred when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) challenged Hillary Clinton’s refusal to raise taxes on the middle class to fund paid family leave.Sanders argued that a modest increase in payroll taxes included in a paid family leave bill he supports would be well worth the additional economic security for American families.It’s a compelling point: As HuffPost’s Samantha Lachman reported, the FAMILY Act, introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), would increase payroll taxes currently used to fund Social Security and Medicare by 0.2 percent, costing the median wage earner an estimated $1.38 a week. That is a small price to pay, the theory goes, for the guarantee of paid time off to care for a newborn or ailing relative.Sanders hinted at a deeper rationale, however, when he noted that in opposing a middle-class tax hike, Clinton is “disagreeing with FDR and Social Security, LBJ on Medicare.”He might have added that using payroll taxes to fund social insurance programs is not merely a matter of Democratic Party precedent.President Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the very least, designed Social Security that way because of the enormous political advantages of dedicated payroll taxes. It is a strategy he memorably explained to Luther Gulick, a public administration expert and skeptic of the payroll tax system.“I guess you're right on the economics, but those taxes were never a problem of economics. They are politics all the way through,” Gulick recalled the president telling him in 1941. “We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral and political right to collect their pensions and their unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program.”History has vindicated FDR’s vision: Social Security and Medicare’s popularity makes them less vulnerable to the kinds of political attacks routinely launched against means-tested assistance programs like Medicaid and Temporary Aid for Needy Families, the latter of which is a shadow of its former self. Proposing Social Security cuts is considered so lethal to a politician’s career that the program has a well-earned nickname as the “third rail of American politics.”In fact, support for Social Security is so strong that notoriously tax-averse Americans would be willing to pay more to shore up the program’s finances. Seventy-seven percent of Americans surveyed by the National Academy of Social Insurance in June 2014, including 69 percent of Republicans, agreed that it is “critical that we preserve Social Security benefits for future generations, even if it means increasing the Social Security taxes paid by working Americans.”By contrast, more than half (51 percent) of Americans think the government “can’t afford to do much more” to aid people living in poverty, according to a September 2014 Pew Research Center poll.Of course, Social Security is the country’s largest anti-poverty program, lifting 21 million people out of poverty in 2014 alone, according to the Center on Budget & Policy Priorities. It also lessens the poverty of many people -- particularly seniors and people with disabilities -- who remain poor while on benefits, but would otherwise be even poorer. Paying higher payroll taxes to shore up the program, or expand benefits as Sanders has proposed, would amount to the government doing more to help people living in poverty.But because Social Security is a universal program viewed as providing benefits earned through taxes, Americans can voice support for Social Security in one poll and oppose increasing benefits for the poor elsewhere without realizing the apparent contradiction.Ben Veghte, who runs the National Academy of Social Insurance’s research and policy initiatives, notes that the dedicated nature of the payroll tax is especially important in an era of deep suspicion of government and, more broadly, institutions.“Part of this is the lack of faith in institutions and Washington,” Veghte said. “People know that if they pay their payroll taxes, it goes to their Social Security and Medicare. There is just a lack of faith that income taxes will be used in their interests.”Nowhere is that phenomenon more evident than in support for the programs among the ostensibly anti-government activists of the tea party movement.A 2010 New York Times/CBS poll found that 62 percent of self-described tea party supporters believed “the benefits from government programs such as Social Security and Medicare"" are ""worth the costs.""In fact, tea party support for payroll taxes underscores the importance of taxpayers believing they have the “legal, moral and political right” to Social Security benefits that FDR hoped to create.Tea party activists’ professed opposition to “government spending” writ large is really directed at perceived handouts for “freeloaders,” according to a Harvard study of the tea party movement published in March 2011.Tea party supporters do not view Social Security and Medicare the same way as other government spending, because they believe the pension and health insurance programs provide earned benefits that all workers pay for with taxes.“I’ve been working since I was 16 years old, and I do feel like I should some day reap the benefit. I’m not looking for a handout, I’m looking for a pay out for what I’ve paid into,” Nancy, a Massachusetts tea party supporter, told the Harvard researchers.It also explains the infamous alleged sighting of one or more tea party demonstrators protesting the Affordable Care Act with a sign that said, ""Get your government hands off my Medicare."" Whether the oft-cited vignette is true or not, as David Frum writes in The Atlantic, it does encapsulate the perception among many Obamacare opponents that by using Medicare savings to fund a new insurance program, President Barack Obama was taking from the deserving -- Medicare beneficiaries -- to provide health care for undeserving freeloaders -- the uninsured.There is also the practical matter of a dedicated tax and benefit structure avoiding the yearly budget fights that have lately been occurring at more frequent increments.FDR and LBJ wanted to “try to insulate these programs from annual appropriations battles,” Veghte said. “Nobody is going to pay these taxes if you do not know that they are walled off.”Clinton’s wariness of raising taxes on middle-class earners is not without merit. The flat payroll tax is regressive in that the cost of contributions is felt more significantly by people with lower earnings, whereas income tax rates rise progressively as earnings levels increase.But the benefits of such a paid family leave program go overwhelmingly to middle- and lower-income people as well, since the costs of care would be felt much more acutely than by upper-income earners in the absence of such a program.Similarly, Social Security has a progressive benefit formula that replaces a larger proportion of workers’ pre-retirement earnings the lower down on the income scale they are.Clinton has yet to lay out the specifics of her paid family leave plan. Her campaign has implied she would fund paid family leave through taxes that apply to the wealthy exclusively. She has promised that she will not raise taxes whatsoever on households with earnings of less than $250,000 a year.Political considerations aside, the Center for American Progress, which is commonly viewed as an arm of the Democratic Party and has strong ties to the Clinton campaign, maintains that funding paid family leave is eminently doable without increasing middle-class taxes. The vast majority of countries fund their paid family leave programs through payroll taxes, according to the Center for American Progress. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island, which have state-level family leave programs, do so as well.Australia is one country that funds family leave through general revenue, rather than a dedicated tax on all workers.Also on HuffPost:"

Was it like 149? Do you not celebrate Christmas and it was zero? Well, Kanye West just gave his wife Kim Kardashian more gifts for Christmas than you can probably even imagine.More than 150 gifts from, as The Daily Mail describes him, ""devoted husband"" Kanye. If only one of those gifts was his follow-up to ""Yeezus,"" and if only instead of giving it to Kim, he just uploaded it for free online.Kim's sister, Kourtney Kardashian, revealed the gift-giving in a video on her website. A voice -- perhaps belonging to a Kardashian or possibly some ghost of Christmas past -- tells viewers that there are ""150 gifts and counting,"" while panning over the presents.Other members of the family also got gifts. North West, holy child of Kimye, rode around on a new mini fire engine in the video. Kim gave Kanye a silver Can-Am Spyder bike, which he drove around their similarly unimaginably impressive property.Perhaps the words of Christmas oracle, Mariah Carey, were not heeded in the Kardashian household, with the sentiment ""all I want for Christmas is you,"" nary in sight. But honestly, if you spent Christmas with Kanye, you would have just said, ""all I want for Christmas is for you to release your album,"" so recognize your own desires.Perhaps you just can't always get what you want -- unless you're Kim Kardashian, because then you get all the presents ever.Also on HuffPost:"

One of the most sought-after dishes in New York in 2004 was April Bloomfield's ricotta gnudi at her West Village gastropub The Spotted Pig. It consisted of translucent pasta skins encasing a creamy ricotta filling, served up in a luscious brown butter and sage sauce. It's an iconic dish, still on the menu, transportingly delicious, but not much to look at. The gnudi are, well, beige and brown lumps. If there's an iconic plate of New York food in 2015, it would be, first of all, a bowl, not a plate. And it might look like one of the preciously composed acaí bowls at Dimes, the chic Chinatown restaurant that serves up veritable set pieces of health food. Dimes' improbable success is partly due to its sixth sense for photogenic dishes. I'd seen photos of its food some dozens of times on Instagram before I ever went to its unassuming Canal Street digs.But within the Insta-food landscape, Dimes is pretty innocuous, because its food is healthy and eminently rational, a factor that becomes apparent when compared to the other staples of New York food porn: baroque bagel sandwiches, face-sized cookies, things in jars, ramen. Unholy mashups that prompt the popular Instagram and restaurant review site The Infatuation to ask ""real food or stupid""?You don't have to be on Instagram to feel the effects of ""food porn creep."" The imagery is omnipresent on news sites; a significant fraction of The New York Times' popular Facebook posts come out of its Dining section. And nearly every new restaurant, whether in the city or suburbs, feels the pressure to include over-the-top, photogenic menu items. For example, a Sydney coffee shop made international headlines earlier this year after it began selling ""freakshakes,"" bloated milkshakes topped with things like entire cakes. The effect of food porn is similar to that of standard pornography, an endless carousel of unnatural pleasures that makes the real thing look boring and underwhelming. How can our animal brains compete?In her new book First Bite, the food historian Bee Wilson explains, ""Once animals have been trained to love certain foods, the dopamine response can be fired up in the brain just by the sight of those foods,"" an effect demonstrated by experiments with monkeys and banana photos.It's good to have some proof that food porn exposure can literally rewire our appetites. I don't know how many times my pet distraction of browsing food blogs during my (usually healthy) lunch break leads me straight to a cafeteria blondie by 3 p.m. I suspect I'm not alone in feeling helpless within a stimuli-rich environment that creates frankly insane food preferences every minute of every day.Wilson ostensibly wrote First Bite: How We Learn To Eat as a study of taste preferences and food habits, but it is really an economics book. Economics is the study of scarcity and choice. And though scarcity may be the last thing that describes our hyperactive food culture, we have a limited number of meals in a day, and days in a life, and the burden of choice is tantamount. Too much of the thinking around food focuses on the objects and environment of consumption -- what we might call the supply side. Wilson's ingenious turn is looking at our preferences -- the demand.It's not for lack of information or advice that our food habits remain unsatisfactory, but that they are tough to translate on the level of our personal decisions. As she writes, in order to adhere to something like Michael Pollan's dictum of ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants,"" one must ""Like real food. Not enjoy feeling overstuffed. And appreciate vegetables."" Easier suggested than done.The premise of First Bite is that ""how we learn to eat... has gone so badly wrong."" So can we relearn how to eat? Can we relearn how to like?Our Fetish For TasteIn the book's introduction, Wilson taps uncannily into a number of food anxieties. ""Our tastes follow us around like a comforting shadow,"" she writes. ""They seem to tell us who we are.""This is precisely why the food-visual culture complex is so pernicious, because it feeds our need for selfhood via preferences. As Wilson says, ""Having particular tastes is one of the ways that we signal to other people that we are unusual and special.""The word ""foodie"" is meaningless today because our food choices are one of our main modes of relating to the world. Everyone (and no one) is a foodie. We all broadcast our consumer choices on social media and on dating app bios. How many Tinder bios include some phrases like, ""loves: quintuple-distilled bourbon"" or ""avocado enthusiast,"" as if that tells a potential partner some deeper truth about oneself? These are symptoms of what Neal Gabler dubbed the post-idea world, where information, things and tangible goods are our intellectual currency.Ironically, when preferences are so abundant, they are expendable. Knowing your favorite food tells me absolutely nothing about you. Your ""likes"" (without their counterpart dislikes, which don't exist in social media) are superfluous. Our investment in curating our consumer choices is inversely proportional to how much they matter.The ""paradox of choice"" is the psychological anxiety caused by too much. Wilson's insight on how this applies to food culture is that ""the challenge is not to grasp information but to learn new habits."" Tiny TastesWilson's exploration of food, choice and love is organized thematically into chapters like ""Memory,"" ""Disorder"" and ""Feeding,"" with a little vignette after each one dedicated to a particular food like birthday cake or beets. One of the vignettes on ""birthday cake"" astutely criticizes a flavor that I have long theorized owes its popularity to food photography, its only edge over other, tastier cakes (and non-cake applications) being its rainbow innards.One of the book's running concerns is how children eat. How their parents and siblings influence their consumption, what children in different countries struggle to eat (radishes in France, okra in Brazil), and the issue of picky eaters. Children, with all their food problems, contain the answers for our predicament, suggests Wilson, because changing what you like (which we usually decide in youth) is the essence of changing what you eat. ""All the foods that you regularly eat are ones that you learned to eat"" as a child, writes Wilson. But today, the ""main influence on a child's palate may ... be a series of food manufacturers whose products -- despite the illusion of infinite choice -- deliver a monotonous flavor hit"" of salt, sugar and/or fat. For picky eaters of any age, Wilson recommends a program of ""tiny tastes"": trying pea-sized morsels of a problematic food, like broccoli, over several days until one starts to like it. This utility of this issue may be lost on those who struggle not with picky eating but with liking and thinking about food too much. But in Wilson's account of preferences, picky eating and food obsession are actually closely related. The uniting force is to approach any diet changes from a place of likes, rather than dislikes (or deprivation). By reacquainting oneself of the pleasure of vegetables, moderate portions and regular mealtimes, we might become saner consumers.Anyone with something other than a totally normal relationship with food -- picky children, food addicts, individuals suffering from eating disorders, chronic dieters -- can partake of the project to acquire ""eating skills that can protect them in this environment of plenty.""Not AdviceThe most surprising and edifying sections of First Bite revolve around picky eating, when Wilson writes on the endless mutability of the human palate. But the lessons are just as applicable to the opposite problem, overeating.It's hard to resist scanning the leisurely volume for takeaways, even though she tried her best to design her book otherwise, with desultory chapters that pull from food history, anthropology, personal history and science. But in a conciliatory epilogue called ""Not Advice,"" she provides some straws at which to grasp.She herself evolved, she writes, from a dieter of the classic adolescent type into the kind of normal eater that would have infuriated her younger self. Although she pointedly rejects the idea of specific dietary advice, she repeats that eating well is a skill.That's something to keep in mind as we navigate the lucid dream of our modern food world. Nothing about it is natural; it's designed to short-circuit the wisdom or intuition with which we may have been born. But having relieved ourselves of the burden of intuition, we can shift our efforts to behavior, which Wilson emphasizes can be changed. We might learn to stop seeking out food blogs, for instance, or limit our time on Instagram, or start to reframe food-pornographic content as ""white noise,"" the way we learn to tune out sexy advertising by the time we're teens.The big mistake would be to just surrender to our ""environment of plenty."" Wilson's book teaches us that the notion of ""I can't help but to like/eat/be seduced by"" certain foods is wrong, because our tastes are not fixed.So our preferences, which got us into this mess, may yet get us out.

A new report alleges that Manning and his wife obtained human growth hormone, which is banned in the NFL, when he was hurt in 2011.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/567f17e41f00000601e9c85a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An Indianapolis anti-aging clinic supplied quarterback Peyton Manning with human growth hormone, a performance-enhancing drug banned by the NFL, a pharmacist who once worked at the clinic asserts in a new special report from Al Jazeera’s Investigative Unit. The report, “The Dark Side,” is the result of a monthslong investigation in which Liam Collins, a British hurdler, went undercover in an attempt to expose the widespread nature of performance-enhancing drugs in global sports. As a cover story, Collins tells medical professionals tied to the trade of performance-enhancing drugs that he is hoping for one last shot at glory at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Manning is just one of many high-profile players the report names and raises questions about.Manning issued a statement Saturday night strongly denying the allegations, claiming that ""whoever said this is making stuff up.""The Denver Broncos also responded to the allegations against Manning, releasing the following statement:""Knowing Peyton Manning and everything he stands for, the Denver Broncos support him 100 percent. These are false claims made to Al Jazeera, and we don't believe the report.The full report, which was shared in advance with The Huffington Post, is viewable here:As part of the investigation, Collins connected with Charlie Sly, a pharmacist based in Austin, Texas, who worked at the Guyer Institute, the Indiana-based anti-aging clinic, in 2011.Manning missed the 2011 season, when he was a member of the Indianapolis Colts, after undergoing neck surgery. In the documentary, Sly tells Collins, who is taking secret video of his interactions, that he was “part of a medical team that helped [Manning] recover” from the surgery. Sly alleges that the clinic mailed growth hormone and other drugs to Manning’s wife, Ashley Manning, so that the quarterback’s name was never attached to them.“All the time we would be sending Ashley Manning drugs,” Sly says in the video. “Like growth hormone, all the time, everywhere, Florida. And it would never be under Peyton’s name, it would always be under her name.”Manning and his wife also came to the clinic after its normal business hours for intravenous treatments, Sly tells Collins on the undercover video.Manning left the Colts after the 2011 season to sign with Denver. The NFL banned human growth hormone in 1991, but did not begin testing for it until 2014. No player has ever tested positive.Manning’s agent denied the details of the report to Al Jazeera, calling Sly’s assertions “outrageous and wrong.” But the statement does not deny that growth hormones were shipped to Manning's wife, only insisting that such matters were a matter of medical privacy.Manning “has never done what this person is suggesting,” his agent told Al Jazeera. “The treatment he received at the Guyer Institute was provided on the advice of his physician and with the knowledge of team doctors and trainers.”“Any medical treatment received by Ashley is a private matter of hers, her doctor, and her family,” the agent said.The credibility of the report hinges largely on whether Sly should be believed, or whether he's simply concocting stories to impress Collins. Several details lend significant credibility to Sly's assertions.First, Sly and the ring he is associated with do, in fact, obtain drugs for Collins, which the network says it retained as evidence.In a stunning scene, Taylor Teagarden, an eight-year MLB veteran, appears in one of the undercover videos, openly discussing his use of performance-enhancing drugs during the previous season.Al Jazeera confirmed that Sly did work at the anti-aging clinic that treated Manning; it is difficult to imagine how Sly would have had knowledge of any arrangement to ship drugs to Manning's wife if he were not operating with genuine insider knowledge. (Sly also describes an interaction with Manning, telling Collins that the quarterback is “really cool if you just sit down with him.”)Collins, in some ways, was the perfect athlete to put at the center of the operation. He's no stranger to the shade, having himself been tied up in a fraud scam in recent years.Beyond the allegations against Manning, the report calls into question the effectiveness of testing regimes meant to prevent performance-enhancing drug use in professional sports, from American leagues to the Olympics. Collins’ undercover quest took him from the Bahamas, where he connected with a doctor that claimed to supply performance-enhancing drugs to Bahamian Olympic athletes, to Canada, where he met naturopathic physician Brandon Spletzer and pharmacist Chad Robertson, who devised a “cutting edge” drug program for Collins that included up to 10 injections each day.Collins then connected with Sly, who has “taken smart drugs to a whole new level,” according to Spletzer.“The Dark Side” paints a picture of an underground marketplace where athletes can easily obtain drugs that are hard to detect even with sophisticated drug tests like those implemented by MLB, the NFL and the Olympics. And it raises questions about how serious the owners of professional sports teams are about rooting out drug use, which can make the games more exciting and profitable, while doing damage to the bodies of players, not owners.“No one’s got caught, because the system’s so easy to beat,” Robertson, the pharmacist, brags to Collins. “And it still is, that’s the sad fact. I can take a guy with average genetics and make him a world champion.”Robertson designed a program for Collins that included prescription fertility and hormone drugs, other substances labeled as “not for human consumption” and illegal drugs. Sly, meanwhile, preached the effectiveness of Delta-2, a hormone supplement that is “steroidal in nature” but is not an anabolic steroid, according to online product descriptions.“There's a bunch of football players who take this, and a bunch of baseball players who take it too,"" Sly tells Collins in the documentary.“Delta-2 is not for use by anybody subject to performance-enhancing drug tests,” state online reviews for the product. Major League Baseball has banned the drug explicitly.The report does not link Manning to Delta-2, but Sly and Robertson name multiple football players as customers, including Green Bay Packers linebacker Mike Neal. Neal, Sly says, connected him with multiple teammates, including defensive end Julius Peppers. Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison is another NFL player he has supplied, Sly says.Sly also names Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard and Washington Nationals infielder Ryan Zimmerman as players who received the drug from him. He also claims in the report he gave drugs to Mike Tyson.Delta-2 is designed to stay ahead of drug tests, Sly explains on video. He tells Collins that he provided the drug to Dustin Keller, a tight end who last played for the Miami Dolphins and allegedly used Delta-2 while in college at Purdue University and then before the NFL Combine, according to Sly. (Keller did not respond to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment). “We just used Delta-2 because it wasn’t detectable,” Sly says.Sly also says that he provided Clay Matthews, Green Bay’s Pro Bowl linebacker, with the prescription painkiller Percocet to help him deal with pain before at least one game. He also brags in one undercover video that Matthews texted him in an attempt to obtain Toradol, a powerful painkiller that is banned in many countries but not in the United States. Harrison, Zimmerman and Howard all denied using the drugs to the network Neal, Peppers, Matthews and Tyson did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.Robertson, the pharmacist, and Spletzer, the neuropathic physician, did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. Sly, when pressed by Al Jazeera, backtracked, saying that his claims about supplying the drugs to athletes were “false and incorrect.” In a subsequent statement to Al Jazeera, he walked back the comments even further, saying that Collins took advantage of him while Sly was grieving the death of his fiancée.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said the NFL banned human growth hormone in 2011. The league actually banned it in 1991. The NFL and its players agreed to begin implementing an HGH testing system in 2011 and began testing in 2014.Also on HuffPost:"
