He wasn't cruel, I think this came from his generationally imprinted self-image and distancing from what he strove never to be. My dad in his final years used wheelchair assistance at the airport, but did not want me to photograph him like that. He confessed also to instances of losing his balance and being scared by it. Both of these men, whom I love and idolize, seem to have forged the path upon which I have further advanced, for unlike grandpa, I speak freely with people on the street and unlike dad, I am okay with using wheelchair assistance and with my condition of imbalance. All of which leads me to meeting Shannon, a young man of strong spirit and presence, who gives me wheelchair assistance from the landing gate to ground transportation at Atlanta Airport. On the long trek, which involves a train ride, we chat. I tell Shannon about my current film job in Atlanta, which like most non-industry people, he seems fascinated by. I like to ask people about their aspirations and objectives, and am often impressed and surprised by the answers I get. Shannon is in pre-med studies, and wants to be a surgeon and also gain his pilot's license. He is articulate, forthright, yet humble. We arrive at the taxi stand and I give him my business card. He likes my self-proclaimed title of ""One Tuff Mutha,"" and I tell him how while filming Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen in the intense desert heat, the transportation coordinator saw me lugging all my gear even with my impairment and called me that. In the ensuing days, Shannon texts me to stay in touch. ""Your words were very encouraging and healing,"" he says. I reply that I was encouraged and inspired by him as well, and that I know he will have opportunities to pass kindness and empowerment on to others. The night before Thanksgiving, he texts: ""Tomorrow I need you to consume as much turkey as humanly possible."" ""Doctor's orders?"" I reply. ""Yessir!"" ""Thanks, Doc... or should I say Captain?"" ""Both"" he says. ""I'm trying to get a lot done.""info@kindsightfoundation.org www.robertzuckerman.com"

The analysis of 63 clinical trials with more than 30,000 smokers found no link between the drugs and heart attacks, strokes, or heart-related deaths.The results were published in the journal Circulation today; and the research was conducted by a team led by Edward J. Mills, PhD, of Stanford University and the Canada Research Chair at the University of Ottawa.More from Everyday Health: 8 Health Experts Weigh In On Navigating the Holidays the Healthy Way 10 Foods That Fight Illness Ten Tips for Sleeping on Planes""Smokers should know that the benefits of stopping smoking dramatically outweigh any concerns of events associated with taking a smoking cessation drug. There is currently no reasonable argument that smoking cessation drugs are associated with important harms,"" said Dr. Mills.Smoking accounts for one of every five deaths, and is now the leading cause of preventable deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is why getting smokers to quit is a top public health priority.In addition to Wellbutrin (bupropion), the stop-smoking treatments used by people in the new analysis were nicotine replacement gum or patches and the nicotine addiction treatment Chantix (varenicline) -- all FDA-approved aids to stop smoking. Treatments lasted three months on average, with an additional 12 month follow-up period. The trials that investigators analyzed for drug safety included some of the highest risk patients. Eight trials included smokers with cardiovascular disease and four trials included smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD. Even for these patients, the smoking cessation aids were not linked to major heart disease.How Stop-Smoking Aids Protect the HeartMills compared the risks with benefits: ""Benefits of stopping smoking are nearly immediate and the long-term benefits of stopping smoking include averting serious cardiovascular disease and cancers -- both illnesses that can include pain, debilitating quality of life and ultimately, death.""""While we don't currently understand the mechanism for why bupropion may decrease the risk of serious cardiovascular disease,"" said Mills, ""it is likely due to both its effectiveness at stopping smoking -- and thus stopping more serious cardiovascular disease.""""Also, it has antidepressant effects, whereby patients may become more relaxed and this brings down their blood pressure,"" he added.In the short term, smokers who used nicotine replacement as gum or patches had twice the risk of mild heart symptoms that resolved over time. Mills explained, ""The short-term effects of nicotine replacement therapy are well known and largely harmless. They include minor issues such as heart palpitations and a rapid pulse.""Healthcare Providers Helping Smokers QuitIn the United States, about 45 million people smoke cigarettes -- nearly 20 percent of all adults, according to the CDC -- but their healthcare providers can help them quit. We spoke with cardiologist John D. Day, MD of Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City Utah about how he advises his patients to kick the smoking habit. ""I strongly urge all of my patients who are smoking to quit as soon as possible.""Day explained that every time a patient comes to his clinic, the nurses ask them if they smoke as part of taking their vital signs, while checking them in. If the patient smokes, their chart is flagged for further counseling as part of their office visit.""I share with them that not only is smoking incredibly hazardous to their heart in that it can cause heart attacks, heart failure, cardiac arrests -- but that it also ages them by approximately 10 years."" Day outlines the benefits of quitting for patients, and said, ""The good news is that if they can quit before permanent damage is done then the body can repair much of the damage.""In his practice, Day urges patients to quit with the aid of therapies like nicotine replacement, bupropion, and varenicline. ""Whatever it takes for them to give up this toxic habit,"" he said. ""Whatever potential risks there are from pharmacotherapy, these potential risks can in no way compare to the lethal effects of smoking.""Day feels it's fortunate that at Intermountain Healthcare where he works, all of the primary care offices have protocols and trained people in place to assist patients in all aspects of smoking cessation. Day noted, ""We provide classes, support groups, counselors as well as trained physicians to help our patients live a better life, free of smoking.""""Drugs to Stop Smoking Are Safe for the Heart"" originally appeared on Everyday Health."

With just a few aides, she managed to get the job done in six weeks. A visit to this museum complex includes a tour of Pickersgill's original circa 1793 home in its original location, exactly where she spent those 6 weeks sewing the fateful flag.

The British bombardment of Fort McHenry in 1814 (during the War of 1812) inspired an observer, Francis Scott Key, to write the words that would become our Star Spangled Banner. One of the most uplifting moments of the tour comes just after watching a short movie in the Visitor's Center when you are invited to stand to sing the national anthem as curtains open to reveal an American flag flying right outside.

This 40-acre museum tells the story of railroading from the place of its origins, on the grounds where the very first commercial track was laid in 1829. Most of the train cars are arrayed within St. Claire's Roundhouse, which, at 235 feet interior diameter was designed to accommodate the largest passenger cars of the day, and was the largest circular industrial building in the world at the time of its construction in 1884. $6, adults, $4 kids, Mon-Sat 10-4, Sun 11-4. 8.

4,WELLNESS,EU Says Aspartame Carries No Health Risks At Current 'Acceptable Daily Intake' Level,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aspartame-health-risks-eu-food-safety_us_5b9db52be4b03a1dcc8bc967,"Studies have linked aspartame to health risks, including cancer and premature birth, and have been blamed for a drop in sales",2013-12-10,"FILE - This Monday, Oct. 15, 2012 file photo shows two cans of Caffeine Free Diet Coke on ice in Surfside, Fla. During a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2013, a Coca-Cola executive noted that Diet Coke was ""under a bit of pressure"" because of people's concerns over its ingredients, alluding to the growing wariness of artificial sweeteners in recent years. Soda has been under fire from health advocates for several years now, and Americans have been cutting back on sugary fizz for some time. But in a somewhat newer development, diet sodas are falling at a faster rate than regular sodas, according to Beverage Digest, an industry tracker. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9db52b2000003000fe11ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BRUSSELS, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The artificial sweetener aspartame - widely used in low-calorie soft drinks - poses no health risks at currently approved consumption levels, the European Union's food safety watchdog said on Tuesday.The finding by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will be seen as a victory for companies such as The Coca-Cola Co., which uses aspartame in Diet Coke, Coke Zero and other products.In August, the company took out newspaper adverts in its home city of Atlanta to address consumer fears over the safety of aspartame.Studies have linked aspartame to health risks, including cancer and premature birth, and have been blamed for a drop in sales of diet soda in the United States.But food safety regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have called these results into question, citing data gaps in the studies and other concerns.In its latest scientific review, Parma, Italy-based EFSA said it had found no evidence of safety concerns at the current EU ""acceptable daily intake"" (ADI) level for aspartame of 40 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of body weight.""This opinion represents one of the most comprehensive risk assessments of aspartame ever undertaken,"" Alicja Mortensen, chairwoman of EFSA's Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Foods (ANS Panel), said in a statement.""It's a step forward in strengthening consumer confidence in the scientific underpinning of the EU food safety system and the regulation of food additives.""A can of diet soda usually contains about 180 milligrams of aspartame, which means that an adult weighing 75 kilograms would need to drink more than 16 cans per day to exceed the EU's ADI level. The U.S. ADI level is slightly higher at 50 mg/kg.Aspartame is approximately 200 times sweeter than sugar and is also sold under the brand name NutraSweet. It was first granted EU-wide approval for food use in 1994 and has been subject to several reviews by EU and national regulators."

Borrow Mini Couture rents dresses, suits and other outfits for ages 9 months to 4 years, priced between $30 and $99 for a five-day stint.It's the little-kid version of adult upscale clothing sites such as Rent the Runway and Lending Luxury. Lieske thinks she and her co-founder, husband Alex Lieske, offer the only online high-fashion rentals for children.That's not because no one else tried. Several companies launched and folded within the last few years, a stark reminder of the difficulties. The online service that seems to have the closest business model is wearhop, which rents children's clothing for one- to six-month stretches.Expense probably plays a role in the muted competition. All those pricey clothes have to be purchased before a company can rent them out, and every season brings new must-haves. Lieske -- whose inventory includes thousands of dresses -- said she's plowed about $650,000 in savings, home-equity loan money and investments from family and friends into the company.But Lieske, a Cockeysville resident who earned her Master of Business Administration from Harvard University in 2006, is optimistic about her company's chances. She worked out some of the kinks by testing the waters with a beta site for just over a year before launching a revamped version in late October.She figured out that it was better to offer free shipping both ways than charge customers a bit less and make them pay for one of the deliveries. And insurance to cover minor stains and tears now comes included, rather than as an optional add-on.So far, so good. Rentals jumped about 50 percent after the redesigned site went up with an expanded line of clothing, Lieske said. She's up to 30 designers offered now.Caletha Crawford, a New York-based children's clothing industry consultant, gave a thumbs up to the labels on the site -- particularly the European picks such as French designer Sonia Rykiel. And she can see why, in an economy still reeling from the recession, entrepreneurs would look for a rental niche.But the competition isn't just other businesses selling high fashion, she said.""I'm not sure they're hitting on the value aspects the way that moms really think about it,"" said Crawford, a founder of the Children's Apparel Consulting Group. ""For a lot of the prices that you could rent a dress, you could buy something that would be also pretty. Now, it wouldn't necessarily be the same name brand, but it would be very pretty.""On the other hand, she said, parents who want those couture labels for a special occasion would definitely save money.Lieske acknowledged the potential draw of cheaper name brands, but she thinks working parents' need for speed and convenience works in her favor there. It's not easy to find a lot of special-occasion children's outfits in one place, she said.She's working to expand the company's reach by connecting with mommy bloggers, high-end photographers and bridal salons that don't carry flower-girl dresses. Borrow Mini Couture's pitch to customers: Rent four for the price of buying one.For example, a Dior silk rose applique dress with a suggested retail sales price of $517 rents for $99 on the site. The ""borrowing fee"" for a Charabia lace dress, retail price $154, is $43.10. Suits selling for even more than Lieske spent on her elder son's outfit two years ago rent for $72 to $83.Courtney Fletcher, a Chevy Chase resident with two young daughters, is an early customer who found Borrow Mini Couture via friends. She's used it three times -- her 41/2-year-old daughter loves dresses and has a highly developed idea of what looks nice.""I don't think I'd use this on a super-regular basis, but I think it's a great thing for special occasions,"" said Fletcher. ""It's so easy.""Borrow Mini Couture dry-cleans the outfits between rentals and eventually donates or sells them. Customers are on the hook for the cost of the outfit, minus the rental price, if it comes back ruined -- the insurance covers minor oopsies -- but that hasn't happened yet, Lieske said.She launched her company while working in marketing for Procter & Gamble. That meant managing the startup in off hours and while out on maternity leave with her younger son. Now she and her husband, Borrow Mini Couture's head of logistics, are all in on the effort.She left her job to focus full time on the startup in October. Alex Lieske, a former private-wealth associate at Credit Suisse, is full time, too. Heidi Lieske knows it's a gamble, but running their own business was something she and her husband always wanted to do, and now seemed like the time.""It's exciting, I'd say -- and scary,"" she said.jhopkins@baltsun.comtwitter.com/jsmithhopkins ___(c)2013 The Baltimore SunVisit The Baltimore Sun at www.baltimoresun.comDistributed by MCT Information Services"
