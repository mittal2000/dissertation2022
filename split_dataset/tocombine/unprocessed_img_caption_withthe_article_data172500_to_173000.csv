The 'Freedom of the Seas' is being built at the Aker Finnyards drydock in Turku, Finland. At 158,000 tons, the 18-deck ship will accommodate 4,370 passengers served by 1,360 crew and, according to Royal Caribbean, be the largest cruise ship in existence. At 1,112 feet (339m) long, her top cruising speed will be 21.6 knots (40 km/h). In the background is the city of Hamburg and the church 'Michel'.

The legality of weddings performed aboard cruise ships is dependent upon the marriage laws of the country in which the ship is registered. Passage of the Marriage Act means that for cruise lines registered in the Bahamas, such as Royal Caribbean, marriages that take place during their voyages can now be recognized by the island nation and recorded in the Bahamas' Marriage Record book.A small group of cruise lines were already able to perform legal ceremonies at sea because they are registered in countries other than the Bahamas, including Celebrity Cruises and Princess Cruises. Many other cruise lines, such as Carnival and Holland America, allow weddings to be performed while the ship is in port, not at sea.Check out this slideshow for some pirate-themed wedding ideas.Keep in touch!

1,STYLE & BEAUTY,Makeup Bars: Are They Helpful or Harmful?,"Baze Mpinja, Contributor

(Photo by Vince Bucci/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c7c1e1f00005000213cd4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An article in the Wall Street Journal last week reported that makeup bars -- boutiques where women pay about $40 to get their faces dolled up by a professional makeup artist -- are becoming a trend in big cities like Los Angeles and Atlanta. But, it's not just bridesmaids and homecoming dance attendees that are booking appointments at the shops. Women who want to look good for lower-profile events like business meetings, dates and parties are also getting in on the action. As the Journal explained, ""Women, more than ever, feel the need to be camera-ready at all times, thanks mainly to cellphone cameras."" So I wonder: Has the pressure to look perfect become so intense that an at-home makeup job doesn't cut it anymore?Don't get me wrong, I believe in the power of makeup. Knowing you look your best can ease some of the anxiety that comes along with giving an important presentation or working the room at an intimidating industry event. But I've always thought primping for something other than a wedding or major night out could be accomplished simply by applying something like extra-black eyeliner or a bright new lipstick, for example, rather than trekking to a beauty studio and paying someone to do it for you. What happened to flipping through a magazine for a new look to try and calling it a day?What the growing makeup-bar trend seems to suggest is that now it takes more -- more time, more money and more help -- to reach that damn-I-look-good, happy place. Social media outlets like Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr have convinced women that they, too, are brands -- pseudo-celebrities who want to make sure that every photo that hits the Internet is in line with her message. Even if it means shelling out a little extra dough for a flawless face.Like the blow-dry bar junkies the New York Post wrote about recently, I worry that the these next-generation makeup counters will create a new group of ""addicts""; women who rely a little too much on pros to feel good about themselves in order to function in daily life.True confidence doesn't waver from D.I.Y. makeup or a bad hair day. And the best part? It doesn't cost a dime.This post first appeared on Baze Mpinja's blog, Beautycism.com. Read more at Beautycism.com"

But what awaited us? I had daunting visions of eating a roast pig while wearing a coconut bra. Maui, it turns, out, has open-air restaurants influenced by Asian plantation culture, and a surprisingly forward fashion scene. Watch this travel video to see what La Carmina uncovered on the ""Valley Isle.""Asia-influenced foodAt Fairmont Kea Lani's Ko Restaurant, I had lunch with the teddy-bear-like Chef Tylun Pang. His dishes are inspired by plantation cuisine, a harmony of influences from the sugar workers' home countries of Japan, China, Philippines and Korea. As he put it, ""The folks in my kitchen are cooking their grandparents' recipes.""Ko sources ingredients locally, from relationships of trust. The menu has several raw, vegan, gluten-free, and heart-healthy selections. My macrobiotic bento box was clean and perfectly balanced, and I ordered a second round of cucumber-pomegranate mojitos. Chef Pang and I said ""cheers"" with his signature dish: ahi tuna on a stick, grilled on a hot stone.Some of the best Hawaiian cuisine fuses Japanese and tropical flavors. The Hyatt Regency's Japengo is a master example, serving hamachi with molecular lychee bubbles, and grilled mahi-mahi with black coconut forbidden rice. I'm still salivating over the enormous sushi and sashimi platter. Local fashionI drove to Paia, a town with a 1960s feel, to interview designer Lisa Letarte Cabrinha. She founded Letarte Swimwear with her sister, and has expanded from bikinis to cashmere zip-ups, kid's clothes, and body lotions. At first glance, I thought ""Sports Illustrated"" -- and then I noticed the subtle rocker elements, like metal rings and animal prints. In a ""dressing room montage,"" I dance around in embroidered dresses. Then I stopped by the studio of Nina Kuna, a young jewelry designer. Originally from LA and NY, she visited Maui and made it home. Nina's designs reflect her love for the island; she turns found beach materials into jewelry castings. Her braided wrap bracelet, strung with a gold-cast cowrie shell, is one of her most popular items.Where to stayMy filmmakers and I loved staying on the south shore, in luxurious Wailea. With private beach access and a koi pond, the Fairmont Kea Lani felt like Xanadu. I appreciated the adult-only swimming pools and large private suites. Wailea Beach Villas: Destination Resorts had the most sumptuous accommodations I've ever encountered. Our 3-bedroom villa came with a tropical garden and private pool, and the grounds flowed with waterfalls. The video shows a dinner party prepared in the kitchen, by a private chef.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c7ab0240000510094b157.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My students are currently studying a unit on belief systems and the impact they have on how people live their lives. Each week we are looking at a different major world religion. This last week was Christianity, which made me think a lot about my own journey with belief systems. Though I am still not committed to one system over another, I have come a very long way on my journey. My travel to different parts of the world has been pivotal to shaping how I have come to know God. This story tells how it all began. I was not, by any stretch of the imagination, one who went to church, let alone tuned in to religious sermons. I definitely was not someone who would take the steps necessary to download a whole spiritual series created by a Texan minister. An extravagant, witty, sarcastic, former-Broadway-dancer-turned-hair-stylist, neither was the person who originally suggested that I tune in, but my friend raved about this minister, so I decided to take a peek. ""Girrrrl, it could change your life!"" Like I was sneaking contraband, I watched a service or two before I would admit to it. Soon enough, we found ourselves whispering about the previous night's sermon while polishing glasses in our liberal, artist-filled jazz club establishment. I still felt squeamish about openly admitting that I was tuning in. ""Oh, honey! You and me both!"" And then we would giggle about the strangeness of the whole scenario. Switching from saying ""Universe"" to ""God"" was a strange transition for my rebellious Catholic school tongue. God and I had agreed to disagree and go on our separate journeys many, many years before. Despite my deep belief in the magic of the universe and the existence of the super natural, I refused to say I ""praised God."" I could enjoy the lessons from the minister, but there was no prodigal daughter in me; my mind was made up. I would soon learn that God, infinitely humorous, holding the upper hand and all, still had a few tricks up his sleeve.I had tuned into the almighty power of the universe and believed fully in manifesting your own destiny and all that, but I still believed that the work was up to me, and so I continued to work my tail off to ""create my own successes."" Being that as it was, when I heard the sermon, (the one I would talk about for years after) I was dubious. Maybe even annoyed. So annoyed that I stewed about it all afternoon.Hoping the call would keep my mind off the fact that I was still many shifts away from the $5,000 I needed in order return to my work in Africa, I called my mom as I emerged from the subway. Should-be-illegal sub-zero winds whipped through the streets and slapped my face, as if chiding me for thinking that I might make any money on a football championship game Sunday. ""There is no way I am ever going to make this happen. I am going to be stuck waiting tables for the rest of my existence. No one is going to come in tonight, and I have less than a month to raise this money or I am going to have to say no to going back to the camp. "" A city block or two of whining seemed to be keeping my blood warm.""Say a few prayers, it could happen.""""Preacher O claims you have to be specific in what you ask for. "" Ohhhhh, no... I had let it slip. I was tuning in to a preacher. I tried to cover it up. ""Anyway... If it is meant to be, the universe will conspire. What's new there?""""Specific how?""Damn... She wasn't going to let it slide. I think she still held a grudge that I got sassy during my First Holy Communion when the priest put the mic to my bride-veiled face and said: ""Do you understand the importance of this? Do you know that we are what we eat?"" Father Mike paused.I smirked: ""So you are saying that, if I eat a grilled cheese, I become a grilled cheese?"" The very packed cathedral stifled a laugh. Or maybe she was still concerned that I was the only person in our family to refuse confirmation. Either way, my confession of sermon watching may have just presented a window of opportunity. ""Specific, like, if you want something, you have to be precise. You cannot just say: I want a plane ticket. You have to say: I want $1,300 to cover my Delta flight to Africa, and another $3,700 to cover the remaining expenses. If God is all knowing and all, wouldn't he know my bank balance needs? Wouldn't he be excited to have me going off to Africa to serve on a refugee camp?"" People around me were starting to stare. Great. I had just outed myself as a sermon-listener to all of Chelsea.""Well, try it. You never know."" I could hear her smile on the other end as I disconnected. Window opened. God help me now...The night was proving to be a bust. Guest after guest called our exclusive restaurant to cancel their hard-to-get reservation. I wasn't going to make five grand that night, no matter how precisely I begged.  To add insult to injury, most of the other servers were sent home for the evening. We had one (already very tardy) reservation of VIPs left on the books. The last remaining server and I were getting ready to draw straws over who could go home next when they walked through the door.They. The late reservation. She came in giggling at her girlfriend's joke. The genteel men de-cloaked the wives of their floor length fur coats. When she bent to shake her stilettos free of snow, I noted that her blouse matched the silk lining in her shoe. It was the same water-marbled blue silk that lined her fur coat. Who does that?The manager ignored our straw draw: ""Erin, I'm cutting James. Stay on top of these people; they are important.""Oh, goodness... What a night this was turning out to be. Approaching the table with a wine list, I could feel my sassy coming on. They were not going to keep me late inside a Chelsea restaurant on a snow-stormy-no-money-making-Sunday and escape the sassy-tongue of an annoyed Erin. It just wasn't possible.""Good evening. I'm Erin. I'll be guiding you through your dining experience tonight. Would you care to start with sparkl -- ?""""No suuuugar, we'll just start with this,"" said the bigger of the two men, now pointing to an exquisite bottle of $1,200 French red from our exclusive section. ""And bring this one (pointing to an $800 bottle of white) for my wife while we decide on the wine for our supper."" That is $2,000 gone, while they decided on the real wine to drink with dinner.Who does that?The sommelier offered the wine for a taste. Big Man waved a not-subtle hand and said: ""Just pour."" Then came the long drawn out ""Suuuuuugarrrrrrrrr, we need some grub!"" Oh. No. He didn't just do that.""Oh, I'm so sorry, I must have missed saying my name. I'm Erin. May I tell you about our featur -- "" ""Oh, huhhhhh-neee, just bring us what's good. Darlin' we're hungry so make it snappy!""Seriously? Was this really happening? This man was about to tip me over the edge.""Oh, and sweet cakes, we are amazing tippers if you are a good waitress."" Edge reached, Erin tipped.""Well, darlin,"" I was no longer responsible for what sassy Erin might say. ""I happen to be the best server you will ever meet, so I hope you keep your word."" Wife spurted a sip of her $800 white; friends roared. Big Man's eyes grew wide, then narrowed. It was on.The next 45 minutes or so proved to be a wit match between Big Man and I. He sassed, I sassed. We were the evening's entertainment. Finally, he grabbed my hand and said: ""You are not just some waitress. What is it that you do?""Pulling my hand away, I snapped: ""You are not from New York, are you?""""No darlin', we aren't. What gave it away?""The list was long. The cowboy hats and heavy southern accents served as the first clues, but I decided to stay with the most obvious factor: He didn't know that no one working in a fine dining establishment in New York was just a server. We all had something other that we were up to, something way bigger than opening some rich man's bottle of wine.""So, what's your something bigger? You trying to make it to Broadway?"" Everyone at the table leaned in, wanting to hear.""Actually, I am trying to get back to Africa. West Africa. Ghana. """"Well, I'll be! Tell me more!"" exclaimed his overly-excited wife, practically jumping out of her seat.I explained my story: that I had been working in the theatre world when I was presented with the opportunity to bring theatre arts and education to the children on the Buduburam Refugee Camp. I said ""Yes!"" before I knew the details and ended up having to raise close to $10,000 to make it happen. It was a life-transforming experience, so much so that I called the theatre tour I was working with and quit so that I could stay another month on this electricity-free, water-sparse, crammed refugee camp in the middle of nowhere.""Oh my goodness! Who does that?"" the wife exclaimed. ""And now? What are you doing now?""""Now I'm trying to raise the money to get back.""I went on to explain that I was offered a very low-paying position managing the organization with whom I had volunteered. I not only had to pay for my own flight, but I also had to raise enough money to cover New York expenses while away. By this point, shoe/blouse/coat woman was nearly standing at the table, bobbing with enthusiasm. She grabbed my hand and, in a hushed tone, told me about their recent Sunday service experience.""We aren't normally churchgoers, but for some reason, I insisted we all go before the New York trip. I just felt like God had a message for me. When we were there, this African man stood in front of the congregation to tell us all about how members of our church had saved him and his family, bringing them over to America. He told us about projects they had taken on in Ghana, all about these wells that they built, schools that they opened, and young lives that they saved with medical care. Now he is doing just amazing things for our community. "" She stopped; the whole table smiled, and stared.""Go on,"" Big Man prodded, ""tell her what you said."" ""Well, I felt like God was givin' us a message, sayin' that we needed to be helping Africa, too. You know where this man was from? Ghana! He was from Ghana!"" Everyone at the table smiled. ""Sounds like maybe God thinks we were supposed to meet.""We found a turning point. They wanted to know everything they possibly could about me. Who were my parents, what did I do with my life, what was my favorite show, what kind of music did I like... When it was time for the bill, Big Man wanted to know all about our tipping policy.Would I receive it all? Could I get cash from a credit card tip? Did I get paid that night, or later? I answered his queries, a bit thrown off by his need for details. Normally they just throw the 18 percent on the line and call it a day. He handed over his heavy, black metal Amex card, never looking at his nearly $4,000 bill.When I returned with the card, Big Man grabbed my hand again.""Darlin'."" ""Yes sir,"" I replied. We were friends now; the sass had left and my southern girl was emerging.""Darlin,' we are amazed by what you are doing and know that we were meant to meet you.""""It's like you are meant to be our Africa angel!"" Mrs. Big Man replied.""Yes, it is like you are our Africa angel, so we want to help you out."" He then slipped something into my palm. A very thick folded pile of something.I just stood, frozen, my hand weak in Big Man's palm, holding a pile of something. ""Are you... did you... Are you contributing to my trip? Even after I was so sassy with you?""""Honey, it is precisely that you were soooo darn sassy that we fell in love with you. No one, and I do mean no one, has ever come back at my rude husband like you did, and that just let me know that you are something special. Anyway, count it.""And so I did. When I reached $1,800, tears fell from my face.""Is there enough there to cover your flight?""Stammering... Lost for words... ""It's too much! Let me give some back.""""Darlin' you may be the smartest gal I have met, but you sure are a fool! Never give money back! Send us a drum when you get there so we know you arrived safely.""""Now, we left a little something on the credit card so everyone else gets their pay tonight. Your tip is in there too. This other something was just us doing what we know God sent us here to do."" Big Man's voice had taken on a fatherly tone.I was in a daze when we said our goodbyes. Hugs were exchanged and promises to send a drum secured with an address scrawled on a vague business card. I never did ask them what they did for a living; for all I knew, they traveled the world making the dreams of servers come true.When I collected the credit card slip, I nearly fell to the ground with weak knees. My money-raising efforts could cease; I had everything I needed for my trip and more than enough leftover to buy a drum. Filled with gratitude, God's humor was not lost on me. My specific request had more than been filled. I picked up my phone and dialed.""Hello, I need to book a ticket to Ghana, please. And let's make it snappy.""Have you ever asked specifically and received the outcome you desire? Tell me about it here!"

What are you doing now?""""Now I'm trying to raise the money to get back.""I went on to explain that I was offered a very low-paying position managing the organization with whom I had volunteered. I not only had to pay for my own flight, but I also had to raise enough money to cover New York expenses while away. By this point, shoe/blouse/coat woman was nearly standing at the table, bobbing with enthusiasm. She grabbed my hand and, in a hushed tone, told me about their recent Sunday service experience.""We aren't normally churchgoers, but for some reason, I insisted we all go before the New York trip. I just felt like God had a message for me. When we were there, this African man stood in front of the congregation to tell us all about how members of our church had saved him and his family, bringing them over to America. He told us about projects they had taken on in Ghana, all about these wells that they built, schools that they opened, and young lives that they saved with medical care. Now he is doing just amazing things for our community. "" She stopped; the whole table smiled, and stared.""Go on,"" Big Man prodded, ""tell her what you said."" ""Well, I felt like God was givin' us a message, sayin' that we needed to be helping Africa, too. You know where this man was from? Ghana! He was from Ghana!"" Everyone at the table smiled. ""Sounds like maybe God thinks we were supposed to meet.""We found a turning point. They wanted to know everything they possibly could about me. Who were my parents, what did I do with my life, what was my favorite show, what kind of music did I like... When it was time for the bill, Big Man wanted to know all about our tipping policy.Would I receive it all? Could I get cash from a credit card tip? Did I get paid that night, or later? I answered his queries, a bit thrown off by his need for details. Normally they just throw the 18 percent on the line and call it a day. He handed over his heavy, black metal Amex card, never looking at his nearly $4,000 bill.When I returned with the card, Big Man grabbed my hand again.""Darlin'."" ""Yes sir,"" I replied. We were friends now; the sass had left and my southern girl was emerging.""Darlin,' we are amazed by what you are doing and know that we were meant to meet you.""""It's like you are meant to be our Africa angel!"" Mrs. Big Man replied.""Yes, it is like you are our Africa angel, so we want to help you out."" He then slipped something into my palm. A very thick folded pile of something.I just stood, frozen, my hand weak in Big Man's palm, holding a pile of something. ""Are you... did you... Are you contributing to my trip? Even after I was so sassy with you?""""Honey, it is precisely that you were soooo darn sassy that we fell in love with you. No one, and I do mean no one, has ever come back at my rude husband like you did, and that just let me know that you are something special. Anyway, count it.""And so I did. When I reached $1,800, tears fell from my face.""Is there enough there to cover your flight?""Stammering... Lost for words... ""It's too much! Let me give some back.""""Darlin' you may be the smartest gal I have met, but you sure are a fool! Never give money back! Send us a drum when you get there so we know you arrived safely.""""Now, we left a little something on the credit card so everyone else gets their pay tonight. Your tip is in there too. This other something was just us doing what we know God sent us here to do."" Big Man's voice had taken on a fatherly tone.I was in a daze when we said our goodbyes. Hugs were exchanged and promises to send a drum secured with an address scrawled on a vague business card. I never did ask them what they did for a living; for all I knew, they traveled the world making the dreams of servers come true.When I collected the credit card slip, I nearly fell to the ground with weak knees. My money-raising efforts could cease; I had everything I needed for my trip and more than enough leftover to buy a drum. Filled with gratitude, God's humor was not lost on me. My specific request had more than been filled. I picked up my phone and dialed.""Hello, I need to book a ticket to Ghana, please. And let's make it snappy.""Have you ever asked specifically and received the outcome you desire? Tell me about it here!"

Residents of New York and New Jersey who were flooded out by Superstorm Sandy are waiting with dread Wednesday for the second time in two weeks as another, weaker storm heads toward them and threatens to inundate their homes again or simply leave them shivering in the dark for even longer.

While losing your venue so soon before your wedding is horrific, it's an obvious problem, one you're hyper-aware you need to remedy. Other Sandy effects, like those that follow, aren't as apparent -- and you may not even know about them until it's too late.1. Local hotels cancel your out-of-town guests' reservations. My heart warmed when a Staten Island hotel refused to kick out evacuees to honor the reservations of New York City marathon runners, in town for a race that never happened. But hotels aren't necessarily honoring rooms booked for wedding weekends either. Even scarier, unless you reserved a block of rooms, you may not be notified that your guests are getting the boot. Contact any far-flung guests and offer to help them find new accommodations if need be.Related: The RUDEST Engagement Ring Comments Ever2. Your venue has power...but no heat or hot water. A funny thing happened in New York City office and apartment buildings: The electricity came back -- or it never went away in the first place -- but the hot water necessary to cook some foods and the heat necessary to warm bodies in the near-frigid fall temperatures weren't available. Good wedding venues have contingency strategies for these things, but you may not love their plan B. Check in with them so there are no surprises on your wedding day.3. Your guests can't arrive on time because they need gas for their cars. The situation's a bit better now than it was last week, but people are still waiting in hours-long lines to fill up. If your guests' tanks get low on the way to your wedding, they may miss your vows because of said lines. Consider postponing the ceremony a bit or posting a reminder to fill 'er up on your wedding website.See more: The Worst Thing a Bride Can Do to a Bridesmaid4. Your guests can't arrive on time because of detours/public transportation service changes. Downed trees and power lines (and in Manhattan, unsteady cranes) have caused street closures, while flooding on train tracks has crippled public transportation. Though conditions are improving each day thanks to hardworking folks, the roads and railways won't be back to normal for quite some time. Investigate the situation near your venue and alert guests -- who may be relying on the directions you provided -- to changes in the route.5. The pretty spot you planned to use for outdoor photos isn't so pretty anymore. Idyllic lakes may now look downright swampy. And canopies of trees may now be piles of branches on the ground. If you had your heart set on a certain setting for your portraits, go see how it appears post-Sandy and scout out a new destination if the scene's no longer serene.6. Your wedding invitations are illegible to guests. You know how mail has that deformed ""I-was-wet-now-I'm-dry"" look when it gets sent out in a rainstorm? Imagine how it looks after a hurricane. Key details on the invitations may be tough to decipher if your invites got soaked. If you were unfortunate enough to send out your invitations just before the storm, call a friend to see how the invite looked when it landed in her mailbox. If she couldn't make out the where and the when (or the who, for that matter), plan to call more guests to clue them in.You Might Also Like: What NOT to Say to Childhood Sweethearts Will There Be Fewer Brides and Babies in 2013?

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c7e0d240000310094b2c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Through my window, I watch snowflakes frost the carcasses of trees downed by Sandy. Though 80% of homes in my NJ town lost power during the super-storm, ours did not. To my three-year-old and five-year-old, Sandy delivered an endless play-date, with a stream of friends and cousins flowing to our door, needing a place to warm-up, recharge, shower, and do laundry. Even during height of the storm, as I lay awake in my bed listening to the hooooooooooo of the wind and jumping every time lightening lit my ceiling, my children snored contentedly in our king-size bed, poking feet into their father's face. I explained to my kids that families were made homeless by the storm, but I was careful not to let them overhear the stories that left me reeling as I listened to NPR. I was beginning to think my kids would remember Sandy as an ""adventure"" of the sort KJ Dell'Antonia described in her piece about children's memories of traumatic weather events. Then yesterday, as we walked to the library in an effort to conserve gas, my daughter began weeping. ""Why are you crying, honey?"" I wondered, because my girl is NOT a weeper. She pointed to the trunk of a fallen tree that had just been sliced into logs. ""That tree. It's dead, and I loved it."" I said, ""Well, that tree was already dying. It's ok."" She said, ""But what about the butterfly bush? It fed so many creatures."" Last summer, the huge butterfly bush on the corner of our block had fluttered and buzzed with life. Sandy uprooted it. She fixed her large brown eyes on me and asked, ""Why did this storm happen?""The easy answer would be that storms are acts of nature and they just happen sometimes. But that's not the whole truth. Global warming does not cause storms, but there is evidence that it might intensify them. Scientists point to the fact that the Western Atlantic Ocean was five degrees higher than the average for this time of year, and that was likely to have fed the energy of Sandy.  As this new storm bears down, I can't help thinking about last years' ""freak"" Halloween blizzard, which brought the giant limb of an ancient oak crashing down over our power and cable lines. I get a pit in my stomach every time I see the gas lines and think that the legacy we are leaving our children could be relentless extreme weather caused by climate change. So I fumbled for a simple way to explain the connection between global warming and extreme weather to my 5 1/2-year-old. This knowledge is a big burden for a small person. Part of my problem was tone: I didn't want to impart a sense of dread. It was my good fortune that a librarian handed me a copy of The Magic School Bus and the Climate Challenge, part of a wonderfully goofy science series by Joanna Cole & Bruce Degan. The book helped me explain that, ""the greenhouse effect is when heat trapping gases, like Co2, act like glass in a greenhouse and make the earth warmer"" and how ""global warming puts more water in the air in some places. That means more rain... and more snow."" I also found helpful kids' websites from NASA and the EPA. I told my kid that we will probably keep having ""bad storms"" unless we find a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. These resources helped me keep the conversation age-appropriate, positive, and focused on how our family can reduce our carbon footprint. Our children must know about the problem in order to dream of a solution."

More than a quarter of its annual sales come during the holiday season.""We bought deep, very deep, and we bought deep on items that matter to our customers,"" said Walmart U.S. Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer Duncan Mac Naughton.Retailers are coming up with fresh ways to entice shoppers this year, as holiday spending is only expected to rise 4.1 percent, according to the National Retail Federation, down from 5.6 percent growth in 2011.Walmart kicked off layaway a month earlier than last year, in mid-September. Layaway allows shoppers to keep a product on hold at the store and pay for it over time. Chains such as Walmart and Target have already published toy catalogs.While the holiday shopping season traditionally kicks off on the day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, the push to sell Christmas presents and other items has been moving earlier and earlier in recent years.Retailers say that shoppers want earlier deals.""'We got customer feedback that says 'I like to shop earlier so I can go to bed earlier,'"" Mac Naughton said.Thanksgiving will be observed on Nov. 22 this year. SPECIAL OFFERSAt 8 p.m. local time on Thanksgiving, Walmart's offers will include deals on video games starting at $10 and home appliances such as a Crock Pot slow cooker and a Mr. Coffee maker for $9.44 each.Walmart also said it would guarantee that three items will be available that night to people standing in line in its stores between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Thanksgiving, though the items are not among the hottest new gadgets of the year.Those shoppers are guaranteed access to an Apple iPad 2 16GB with Wi-Fi, a March 2011 version, priced at $399 with a $75 Walmart Gift Card; a 32-inch Emerson 720p LCD TV at $148, $80 below the usual price; and an LG Blu-ray player for $38 that Walmart does not typically sell but said goes for $68 to $79 elsewhere.After a round of specials focused on electronics at 10 p.m. Walmart will take a break from special deals, giving shoppers a chance to get some rest or perhaps visit other stores.Walmart now keeps its stores open overnight between Thanksgiving and Black Friday after an employee was trampled to death when a Long Island store opened on Black Friday in 2008.Last year, key competitors including Target Corp began their special offers at 12 a.m. on Friday.Other items to be offered during the night include brands such as Vizio, Samsung, Nikon, Nook and Beats by Dr. Dre.""I think we have the brands that our customers want,"" Mac Naughton said.A variety of items from Goodyear tires to a Singer Sewing Machine go on sale at 5 a.m. on Black Friday.Last year, Target, Best Buy, Macy's and Kohl's were closed on Thanksgiving and kicked off Black Friday sales at the stroke of midnight, their earliest starts ever. Best Buy Co Inc, Macy's and Kohl's all plan to open at midnight again, while Target has not given its plans yet.Sears Holdings Corp's Sears and Kmart stores will be open on Thanksgiving Day. Last year, Sears kept its discount chain Kmart open on Thanksgiving but the Sears chain was closed.This year, Sears stores will open at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and stay open overnight until 10 p.m. on Black Friday. Kmart has been open on Thanksgiving for the last 21 years.In 2011, Walmart began with deals on toys, home items and clothing at 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving, followed by electronics deals at midnight and other offers at 8 a.m. on Friday, Nov. 25.Most Walmart stores will be open on Thanksgiving, unless they are required to close by local or state law.Walmart has faced protests in various U.S. cities lately and some workers have planned to walk off the job on Black Friday. Such actions are being sponsored by groups including a contingent of workers called OUR Walmart that receives union support."

Today is day #10, and we remain without electricity, heat, stove usage, hot water, cable or Internet service. Select food is running low at some grocery stores, and gas lines are outrageous. On top of all this, today we are having a Nor'easter with rain, wind and sleet, and temperatures are in the 30s.Nothing quite prepares you for all this. We suffered some damage to our home, but it's quite minimal in the scheme of things. For that, I am hugely grateful. There are way worse situations than ours -- totally heartbreaking stories of the loss of people and property. How do you bounce back from that?! I like to believe that people are resilient, but it's a huge load to bear. I often joked (a sad joke) in the past that when someone sneezes in our town, we lose power. It has become an annual event, if not more frequent. I told my husband that this is now a huge quality of life issue that warrants the exploration of investing in a generator that would hopefully improve things in the future. Until then, for the first three nights after Storm Sandy, we stayed with one empty nester friend and her husband. We left when her son and his family arrived with their 18-month-old child from Hoboken, New Jersey. Severe flooding coupled with downed power lines contained them in their home for days, and just when the power resumed, they were forced to evacuate due to mold.Then, we stayed with a mom friend and her husband who have a 7-month-old baby for one night. Fortunately, they lost power for only two days, which for them, was bad enough.Since then, we've been with a mom friend and her 9-year-old boy, who is my son's friend. They lost power for a number of days and then regained it. Another family is staying here as well, so it is a full house.Early on, we took our pet cockatiel Smokey to the vet for boarding so he would be warm and safe. I'm glad to not to have to worry about his welfare.Living out of a suitcase isn't something that fully suits me, though I'm growing more and more used to it. The harder part is playing musical beds. I have a bad back, and sleep best on certain types of mattresses, and being on a foreign bed takes adjustment. But, at least we have beds, and warmth, and nourishment, and the welcome arms of friends.Psychologically, it's all been unnerving. Living in the gray from day to day... not having any concrete sense of when power, etc. might return. Having to cancel/reschedule appointments, figure out how to get my son to school (it reopened today), pack and unpack, hoping our frigid pipes don't burst... the list goes on. As hard as it's been, what will remain with me even longer than the memory of all of these hardships is the behavior of my son. Having the care and responsibility of him is not something I take lightly, and he's been freaked out from this whole experience. He refuses to set foot in the house, which is like a cold, dark, unwelcoming cave... I don't blame him. So, when we've returned home quickly to get things we need for our next stay, he's remained perched on our front door stoop, flashlight in hand, ushering us out of the house as quickly as possible.Other than his discomfort, which I fully understand, he is maturing before my eyes, and I couldn't be prouder.He is coming into his own, and with every household stay we've had, he's endeared himself to our hosts.He's not only peacefully and happily entertained himself on his laptop, but has taken initiative to be helpful.He's taught our hosts things on their computers; assisted in replacing a tile kitchen floor; put together an impressive Legos toy for a friend; played with babies, etc., etc. He's been supportive, caring and there to help and comfort, and I'm little by little seeing the person he is to become. I like what I see. He's becoming a mensch (decent, responsible person), capable of doing good in the world... and much good is needed just to survive in this world.Not that it takes a Storm like Sandy to bring out his best, since he has always been a kid who takes pride in being there for others, and he is seeing the best in people like those who have taken us (and others) under their roofs, whether convenient or not for them. We, of course, would do the same, if the tables were turned. It was nice not to have to ask. We were just invited with unconditional love and concern. There are many similar stories to ours, and people all over the impacted areas and beyond are pitching in to the best of their abilities, including donating to the Red Cross.I have no clue when our power will resume, so I'm learning to take things day by day. It's a true life lesson in so many ways, and one that will go down in the record books for all of us --especially those personally impacted.For my son, all the textbooks and schooling in the world couldn't teach him the strength, patience and empathy he's learned through this experience. These lessons will serve him well as he one day takes on adulthood."
