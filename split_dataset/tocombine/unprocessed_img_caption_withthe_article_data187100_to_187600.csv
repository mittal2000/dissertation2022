But after the soggy barge pageant Londoners endured on Sunday, it must be nice to cozy up in Buckingham Palace for an intimate concert... with 10,000 other people.Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee concert, which is happening right now (see the livestream here), was organized by the BBC and Gary Barlow and includes basically every major UK star: Cheryl Cole, Kylie Minogue, Grace Jones, Annie Lennox, Madness, Cliff Richard, Shirley Bassey, Elton John, Paul McCartney, Tom Jones, Jessie J, Ed Sheeran... and many more we've never heard of.Because truth be told, we're more psyched about the famous faces in the audience rather than onstage. Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife (and total fashion plate) Samantha are sitting ""in executive company"" near Zara Phillips, Queen Elizabeth II's granddaughter, and her husband Mike Tindall, as well as princesses Beatrice & Eugenie. Camilla and Prince Charles are also in the audience (Hello! caught them having a laugh).And of course the Duchess of Cambridge brought her three best assets -- her hubby, her adorable brother-in-law and her shiny hair -- along for the big event. Wearing a patterned blue and purple dress from Whistles with an Alexander McQueen coat (so much McQueen!), Kate waved the Union Jack and cheered on the performers. The Queen, hatless and in a dark, gold-buttoned coat, arrived late, owing to Prince Phillip's recent bladder infection. The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to the hospital, where he remains at this time. But Her Majesty still managed to celebrate in the audience... albeit with ear plugs in. See pics below -- more coming soon! To catch the end of the livestream, head to Styleite.com. Happy Day 2 of the Jubilee, everyone!"
