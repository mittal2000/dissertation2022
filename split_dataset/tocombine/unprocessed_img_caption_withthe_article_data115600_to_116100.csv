Germany is the World Cup champion for the fourth time, after Super Mario Götze's superb strike won it in extra time on Sunday. The super sub wasn't even born the last time his nation won the title in 1990.Somewhere in Southern California, USA coach Jürgen Klinsmann is having a quiet smile. He was a key member of that 1990 World Cup-winning Germany squad, and must be happy to see his former protégé and present Germany coach Joachim Löw accept the accolades for inspiring the tournament's best overall team. Klinsmann tweeted: ""Jogi you did it!...The best team won the 2014 World Cup.""Löw had said before Sunday's title game that the team had a ""clear, persistent game-plan"" and if they were courageous and believed in their own strengths, that they would win. And how they did. Germany captain Philipp Lahm said it was just an ""unbelievable"" feeling to be World Cup champions.But little maestro Messi, who won the tournament's Golden Ball award for best player, and his heroic Argentina team were left despondent. After 64 games and 171 goals, many of the spectacular highlight reel variety, what a tournament! Two of the most stunning tournament results were Spain 1-5 Netherlands -- the first sign that Spain's title reign was over. And, then Brazil 1-7 Germany in the semi-final -- a resounding revelation that there wasn't going to be a fairy-tale ending for the wonderful host nation. Overall, to change up T.S. Eliot's words, ""This is the way the world (cup) ends, with a bang not a whimper!""But what a bang, what a blast! And, so much raw, unadulterated passion! Now, welcome back to our day jobs and regular lives. Grrrrrrrrr!Colombia's ""James"" won the Golden Boot, for top scorer with 6 goals, ahead of Germany's Muller. While Germany's Neuer won the Golden Glove for best goalie. My fave stunning goals included: van Persie's once-in-a-lifetime, diving header vs Spain; James' magnificent chest and thumping volley vs Uruguay; magical Messi's solo dash and curler vs Iran; USA Jones' wonder blast of an equalizer vs Portugal; and, Germany's Klose departs with a winner's medal and with the all-time World Cup scoring record of 16 total goals!On Saturday, in the third place game and in front of another packed yellow clad crowd in Brasilia, to add insult to injury, Brazil lost again, this time 0-3 to fellow vanquished semi-finalist Netherlands. So, after not losing at home in a competitive match in 39 years, host Brazil just lost two straight home games. Ouch! Brazil's sometime captain Luiz, who was recently sold from his English club team Chelsea to PSG for £50 million -- a world-record fee for a defender -- had a nightmare...again. Before the game, Dutch coach van Gaal felt the match was irrelevant, suggesting, ""There is only one award that counts...becoming world champions. The worst thing is that there is a chance you are going to lose twice in a row. And in a tournament in which you have played so marvelously well you go home as a loser."" But van Gaal and his Oranje team go home smiling, a winner and in third place. Meanwhile host Brazil does lose two in a row and stays home...a loser! Double ouch! But, commiserations to the wonderful people of Brazil.Then on Sunday, Germany earned its 4th World Cup title but first in 24 years -- titles just don't come easy. In the process, Germany saved more salt being rubbed into Brazil's still fresh wounds and stopped the Seleção's great nearby rivals, Argentina, from winning the title in Brazil's own Maracanã stadium. Thanks for the memories. Muito obrigado, Brazil, for your joy and hospitality.Follow Ashley Jude Collie's World Cup coverage at MadeMan."

This act strikes a dramatic blow to the ""money is everything"" mentality that has permeated sports. James writes that he cares deeply about the young children and quality of life in Northern Ohio. He speaks stirringly to the power of sports to elevate the human spirit and bring a community together. For the first time he has opened up regarding his priorities, decision-making, and larger mission in a way that makes him endearing and inspirational.LeBron James has been the most impactful NBA player for years, but he also has been one of the most criticized and unloved. He has been a prodigy since high school with some high school games nationally televised because of his appeal. The heavily hyped way he left Cleveland left a bad impression in much of the public scope. It seemed narcissistic and circus-like, little empathy was shown for the fans of Cleveland. Less publicized was the large amount of money raised for charity. LeBron was known through endless commercials and promotions which did not seem to bond him with fans. Returning to Cleveland in a way that both admits mistakes and drops grudges for a larger cause will change all that. LeBron's legacy becomes that of an athlete who really cares about people.The city of Cleveland has been the butt of jokes for years. It has produced leaders in all fields, is an interesting city to visit, and has many attributes. It won't be a joke anymore. The biggest star in American sports had the freedom to choose from an array of enticing cities and he chose Cleveland for the love of the community. Don't look now but the Cleveland Browns managed to draft the most exciting high profile young player in the country -- Johnny Manziel. Sports fans will now look longingly at a city where it is great to be a sports fan. Sports telecasts focus on a city. Cleveland will once again experience the pride and economic benefits that high profile exposure provides.I ask each client who is a free agent to do an internal inventory and rank their own priorities. They list short term economic gain, long term economic security, geographical location, family, winning, coaching, and facilities. For most athletes, money wins out. LeBron made a different type of decision that reaffirms traditional American values. James could have held a grudge based on Cleveland Cavaliers' owner, Dan Gilbert's, scathing letter and the derision of fans from Cleveland that followed his move to Miami. Instead, he elevated his vision and put love for his community first. He chose love of city and people above all. I ask clients to understand that they are role models -- they can trigger imitative behavior in adolescents and kids.When Lennox Lewis cut a public service announcement ""Real Men Don't Hit Women,"" it impacted rebellious adolescents attitude towards domestic violence in a way that traditional authority figures could never do. Athletes can foster positive change and create a climate of empowerment where people are filled with optimism and hope.I've spent 40 years pushing the concept of athletes as community leaders and beacons of change. In one dramatic action, LeBron has set a template for the integration of athletes and the communities that they play in and come from. Rather than hired Hessians skimming the cream from a community and leaving, James sets a standard for civic-minded athletes who understand they have responsibilities. Long live King James!"

LeBron James just signed a contract to join the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers... in case you hadn't heard. I like LeBron's choice this time for many of the same reasons you might like it, but I have another very good reason for liking it. LeBron, perhaps unwittingly, has gotten out of the engineering business.These days the term ""engineer"" has changed meaning from ""grimy guy driving the train"" to a verb synonymous with create. As in, engineering a disease-resistant soybean or engineering a leveraged buyout. Unfortunately, with an unskilled engineer, the train can quickly run off the tracks. Over recent weeks, there has been endless sports coverage of the imminent player upheaval in the NBA. First, there was the NBA draft. More recently, there has been the sometimes wild speculation about where the players making up this year's free agent crop will land. LeBron James, the most noteworthy of these free agents until today, has garnered the most interest and media coverage. LeBron's last move, in 2010, was so significant that it has come to be known simply as ""The Decision."" Much will be written and said in the coming months on the always important question about how to assemble the available talent, both young and established, to win championships.   After all, four years ago, LeBron left the Cleveland Cavaliers to join forces with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat to win championships. How did that work out for ""King James""? The Heat have won two of the last four NBA championships. Not bad, but they were resoundingly thumped by the San Antonio Spurs in the 2014 championship series. The Spurs won this year's championship because they played unselfish, team basketball. They had extraordinary team chemistry.Perhaps the most elusive question in sports is how one goes about assembling a highly successful team. Can you engineer a championship team? Can you engineer team chemistry?I never warmed to ""The Decision."" The notion that a player or a group of players can figure out who to put together for championship success strikes me as deluded and dangerous. What do I know? I have the sense to know what I don't know. Maybe LeBron has this same sense after his experience in this year's NBA finals? Moneyball (written by Michael Lewis) has precipitated a revolution in sports. In fact, ""Moneyball"" and the awareness it created about the metrics used for evaluating player talent in baseball, has given birth to the field of sports analytics. Every sport, and I mean all of them, has undergone a major rethinking of what counts and what gets measured when evaluating players. The same level of analysis has been applied to basketball for some time now. A 2009 New York Times article called the ""The No Stats All-Star,"" focused on Shane Battier as the player the Houston Rockets had to have... even though Battier flew under the radar by historical statistical standards. What was so special about Battier (then of the Houston Rockets, now a two-time ring-winner with the Heat)?  The article didn't say, and for good reason. Of what use are your proprietary analytics if everyone knows them? The Rockets, under the direction of analytics zealot and General Manager Daryl Morey, are widely recognized as the league leader in stats fanaticism.But the Rockets haven't won it all. Bad stats? Not really. Talent plus chemistry is the real championship gold.The problem of how to select players who fit together, who create powerful team chemistry, is the holy grail in sports analytics and it cuts across every team sport. Do any teams have the answer? Probably not. Like the Holy Grail, team chemistry might be forever cloaked in mystery and intrigue. The problem is there are too many variables, many of which you can't begin to know until after you have assembled the team. Then, past performance on one team might look very different from future performance on another team. There are too many unknowable, moving parts. So maybe it's something in the individual that can be measured, you say, which is good thinking. Well, if you know much about ""measuring"" personality (e.g. Myers-Briggs, the most widely used psychometric), it is an inexact science, at best.Ultimately, it's possible to put together the right players to create a championship basketball team. Analysts are working on this right now, but they aren't talking.  What's clear and knowable is that players shouldn't be engineers. It's impossible for players to know whom to assemble to form a championship team, including King James and any other players he brings to his ""roundball"" table. As I read over LeBron's statement about this decision, engineering was no where to be found, and that's the way it should be."
3,HEALTHY LIVING,5 Reasons to Let It Go Before a Presentation,"Leisa Peterson, ContributorBusiness Strategist and Money Coach",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-reasons-to-let-it-go-be_b_5578593.html,"Even though I am not exactly sure what I said and did, I could tell that people were deeply moved by the talk.

When you typically avoid caffeine due to the jitters it causes, it was definitely dumb. But I was having fun with a group of new friends I had met at Catalyst Week in downtown Las Vegas, and the cool drink was refreshing on a hot day. When I laid down later that evening to go to sIeep, I realized my mistake.As much as I tried for the first few hours, sleep was not happening, and so I found myself thinking about the workshop. I had not given the talk before nor did I know any of the attendees before arriving at the Downtown Project the previous day. I was pretty certain most of the people had not come to the event thinking about meditation and mindfulness. For that and many other reasons I really wanted the talk to go well but was feeling the kind of fear you get when you are about to go outside of your comfort zone. With the hours passing by, I realized that the already revised, many times over, version of my talk was not where I wanted it to be which led me to rethink everything.As panic began to surface, I paused to consider that I couldn't very well teach others about mindfulness if I wasn't practicing it myself. This led me to begin my regular morning meditation practice at about 1:30 a.m., figuring I could do the meditation now and then have some extra time to sleep in. As with my usual practice, I started by generating a feeling of loving surrender which calmed me down quickly. With a more settled state of mind, I shifted my attention to the breath and then onto the visualization of letting go of the tension in my body through the breathing process. As I lay in this state of calmness, I could see that not being able to sleep was a blessing in disguise as it gave me a chance to reconsider the talk. In that split second realization it also came to me that instead of rewriting it, I needed to let it go and focus on being present for the experience even if that meant complete failure. Having a high level idea of what I wanted to cover was enough and the rest was to be surrendered in the moment. This was the exact opposite of my normal type-A, ""must be prepared,"" approach and even though my head was thinking it was sheer craziness, my heart loved the idea.With my heart winning out, sleep came quickly and I arose the next day without feeling tired. I got up, got ready and arrived at the workshop with time to spend a few minutes meditating. Even though I had some remaining fears with the new plan, deep down I knew it was the right path.What happened next was nothing short of a miracle. Even though I am not exactly sure what I said and did, I could tell that people were deeply moved by the talk. By showing up as I did, people were caught off guard and then found themselves opening their hearts at a level that took them by surprise. It was better than I could have hoped for and I learned a great deal about the power of letting go when you are about to give an important presentation. Here are five reasons to consider letting it go before your next talk.1. The real you will shine through.  Living in a world of overly-staged and highly-produced experiences, many people are eager to listen to speakers who are real, fully present and open to their audience. When talks are super-rehearsed, the heart and soul can get drained out. However, when I let go and surrendered into the experience of being present, my soulfulness emerged and the real me shined through. Of course, it helps to have a large body of interesting information to pull from but there is nothing quite like knowing a speaker is speaking from their heart and soul in the present moment. Yes, my talk was about mindfulness but so is everything else at some level.2. You share more.  After years of teaching mindfulness and helping people live more satisfying lives, I've witnessed the power of telling a story to make a point. Most people have the ability to tell stories, we do it every time we talk about something that has happened to us. Maybe some do it better than others, but by paying close attention to important details plus a bit of practice, everyone can successfully talk about a personal experience in an interesting manner.During my talk, I took a chance and told a story I hadn't shared with more than a few people about a horrific event I witnessed last December. Thinking I had reached a point where I could tell the story without crying, I still had some concern about how it would be received and if it would be helpful to others. Judging from the comments received after the talk, the story touched people deeply. By taking a leap of faith, I learned the immense power of sharing my personal stories with others even when it isn't easy and even when the ""why"" isn't totally clear.3. Your presence touches people deeply.   I've noticed several discussions about the power of presence lately. Presence is your ability to be open, available, and vulnerable. When we learn to let go in our presentations, we become more vulnerable which naturally leads to an increase in presence. When your energetic power becomes so focused on your audience rather than your words, your audience hears you at an experiential level. This also shifts what you talk about because you become more likely to talk to your audience, not about what you want to tell them, but what they are ready to hear.4. You get to enjoy it.  Even though I had some fear inside when I started talking, my concerns went away quickly, and I was able to enjoy the incredible opportunity to share my gifts with others.5. You help your audience in bigger ways.  When you let it go and become vulnerable, you gain the courage to share things that may be embarrassing and uncomfortable. By sharing personal stories of your challenges and difficulties in a public setting you help others avoid taking similar paths. At Catalyst Week we spoke a lot about collisions, connectedness and colearning which are all amazing concepts, but the one that really sticks is ROI, Ripple of Impact. If you are ready to make a ripple of impact in the world through your presentations, I suggest you learn to let it go.Photo credit: Andy Dean Photography/Bigstock.com"
4,POLITICS,Warren's Mortgage Reforms Divide Progressives,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-housing-finance_n_5577687.html,,2014-07-14,"Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts speaks to a group of supporters at a rally in support of Kentucky democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, Sunday, June 29, 2014 at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Ky. Warren has been canvassing the country following a failed vote in the U.S. Senate that would have allowed some people to refinance their student loan debt to take advantage of lower interest rates. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cf722200005700dd7a27.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is dividing Wall Street critics in Congress by leading talks regarding a controversial Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform bill that some of her usual allies would prefer to abandon.Warren is negotiating with Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) over a housing finance overhaul that cleared the Senate Banking Committee in May. The bipartisan bill, authored by outgoing Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) and Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), has been sharply criticized by bank reform advocates, including Warren, and some conservative groups for recreating many of the same problematic incentives that took down Fannie and Freddie in 2008. The dispute among Democrats on the banking committee is mostly over tactical considerations, but it has unearthed an ideological fault line in the progressive movement: Should Fannie and Freddie be reformed to be more friendly to the middle class, or should their operations be scrapped in favor of a private -- or fully public -- system?""The whole Crapo-Johnson approach ... seeks to replace a mortgage system the size of JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup combined [and] is a dangerous and misguided approach that creates unprecedented complexity in the form of an experiment that may not work -- and at worst, will roil and unsettle markets and risk our system of mortgage finance,"" said Josh Rosner, managing director at Graham Fisher & Co. ""It is worse than GSEs were at their worst.""Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) is also involved in the talks, but it's Warren's seal of approval that has some progressive housing advocates fretting. According to multiple Democratic sources, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), one of the most forceful Wall Street watchdogs in Congress, would prefer to see the bill scuttled entirely. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), arguably Warren's closest Senate ally, is sitting out the negotiations. And Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who consistently votes with Warren on the committee and is emerging as a surprisingly reliable skeptic of big banks, has also avoided the talks. Six Democrats on the committee voted for the original reform bill, which Warren voted against. Negotiators need to secure at least three additional votes to convince Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to bring the bill to the floor.Warren's progressive opponents argue that her chief goals are at odds with one another, and a significant strategic risk is attached to having her name on a bill that could change dramatically either on the Senate floor or in the House. Supporters argue that she is targeting core problems with the bill, and believe a bipartisan Senate consensus would make it easier (eventually) to enact a good bill. ""This is a long game,"" said Barry Zigas, a former Fannie Mae senior vice president who now serves as director of housing policy for the Consumer Federation of America. ""The economy needs a fair and durable mortgage finance system, and the Johnson-Crapo bill solidified bipartisan support for critical parts of that, including a federal guarantee for mortgage securities. But it needs more work, and Sen. Warren's, Sen. Corker's and others' efforts on both sides to improve it -- especially to make sure it serves the broadest possible range of creditworthy borrowers and holds its participants accountable for doing so -- are really important.""Fannie and Freddie exist, ostensibly, to lower the price of mortgages for consumers. The firms purchase mortgages from banks, pool them into securities, and sell them to investors, while guaranteeing those investors against losses. That guarantee increases investor appetite, which allows banks to offer mortgages at lower interest rates. Prior to the crash, that system hinged on an implicit government guarantee: Investors knew that if anything ever happened to Fannie and Freddie, taxpayers would take the hit. But this support encouraged Fannie and Freddie -- which officially functioned as for-profit companies -- to engage in increasingly risky activities in the pursuit of higher payouts for shareholders and executives. When Wall Street banks started scoring huge profits on subprime loans, Fannie and Freddie followed their lead and, like the big banks, were ravaged and bailed out.In an era of congressional stalemate, the mortgage finance status quo has its advantages. Liberal economist Dean Baker has emphasized that government control of Fannie and Freddie eliminates the core problem of the old order: private profit at public expense. The government is currently on the hook for losses, but it also books the profits from Fannie and Freddie's dealings.There are also problems. Then-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner set up a bailout repayment plan for Fannie and Freddie that makes it impossible for the firms to establish a capital cushion. The profits from their current operations are simply swept back into Treasury every quarter. Without beefier capital levels, Fannie and Freddie are barred from changing mortgage standards that would allow many creditworthy middle-class families to buy homes.""Sen. Warren opposed the Johnson-Crapo bill in committee because she believes that it would make it harder for creditworthy borrowers to get affordable mortgages and for smaller lenders to compete against larger ones,"" Warren spokeswoman Lacey Rose told HuffPost. ""But she is also very concerned about the lack of access to mortgage credit in the current system for lower income families and African-American and Hispanic families."" U.S. homeownership rates have long been sharply stratified by race, a phenomenon Suzy Khimm recently detailed for MSNBC. Even in the heyday of the housing bubble, most African Americans did not own a home. Today, the figure is about 43 percent, compared to 72 percent for whites. While lending standards for Fannie and Freddie have tightened already, a botched overhaul could easily leave much of the market, particularly people of color, without good options.The current alternatives to Fannie and Freddie are, at the high-end, the jumbo mortgage market, and at the other, the Federal Housing Administration. The jumbo market is for loans that are too big to qualify for Fannie and Freddie treatment, and features higher interest rates since its loans don't benefit from government backing. The government runs FHA to assist first-time borrowers seeking smaller-sized loans, and conservatives have long waged an ideological campaign against the agency's very existence, as affordable housing advocates are well aware.""We don't want a housing apartheid, where you've got one system over here for the better heeled homeowners and then everything else is dumped in an FHA bucket,"" said Urban League President and CEO Marc Morial.Warren has focused on two central aspects of Johnson-Crapo. First, the bill's weak language on affordable housing provides no homeownership mandate, and no requirements to make loans in underserved markets. Second, its potential to exacerbate ""too big to fail"" by turning over many of Fannie and Freddie's powers to Wall Street, replete with government subsidies. Tackling either issue is a tall political order, and in some ways, the two goals are in conflict. Johnson-Crapo offers two replacement regimes for Fannie and Freddie. One would allow Wall Street banks to sell mortgage bonds that put private-sector investors on the hook for 10 percent of all losses, with the government shouldering the remainder. It's easy to understand why banks have been lobbying hard in favor of such an arrangement. It would give them a piece of Fannie and Freddie's game, allowing them to offer ""low-risk, high reward"" products -- a financial holy grail that doesn't currently exist on the private market. It's also the same public-risk-for-private-profit model that brought down Fannie and Freddie, and a big new line of business for banks that are already too big to fail.Warren wants to forgo that model in favor of the other system outlined in Johnson-Crapo, which would require a public utility to issue mortgage bonds, with 100 percent of any losses insured by a heavily regulated private company. The government would only step in should the insurer fail.Every bank reform Democrat on the banking committee agrees that Warren's ""bond guarantor"" model is an improvement. But the model has credible detractors, including Rosner, a longtime critic of Fannie and Freddie who was one of the few to accurately diagnose the problems that eventually brought them down.""This is the worst Rube Goldberg approach: Rather than fixing the GSEs as fully private, well-capitalized entities with real capital and rate-of-return caps and no guarantee, which would lead market participants to price deals based on the GSEs' capital, deals will be based on a government backstop,"" Rosner said. ""It's a horrible subsidy that ensures a future systemic event.""By focusing on the types of public-private hybrids that might be acceptable, the ideological scope of the housing reform talks has narrowed significantly since the years immediately following the crisis. Rosner and other reformers, including Raj Date, an ally of Warren's at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the agency's formative years, had advocated doing away with the convoluted subsidies of the Fannie and Freddie system in favor of a private market with more straightforward tax credits. Rosner advocates a special tax program to help low-income families save for a down payment. He has also argued that the mortgage interest deduction, which rewards families for taking on debt, should be swapped out for a mortgage equity deduction, which rewards families for paying it down.Such an approach to housing subsidies would be far more efficient than anything currently being contemplated by the banking committee. And its efficiency is one reason why it has little political support. Conservatives are reluctant to vote for a direct subsidy, even one that would ultimately save taxpayers money. And elected officials consider any move away from the very popular mortgage interest deduction to be politically toxic.The basic, legitimate social goal of giving citizens access to an affordable house and financial foundation is also a convoluted game of insider rewards: Any piece of mortgage-related legislation typically has to benefit various interest groups -- from realtors all the way up to hedge funds -- in order to actually pass Congress.To advance the ""bond guarantor"" model, Warren will have to work out tricky technical details. Capital is the buffer between the bond insurer and taxpayers, and that buffer needs to be robust to protect the latter. But among Democrats, progressive and otherwise, there are real differences on the subject.Warren subscribes to a widely held belief in high finance that hefty capital standards make loans more expensive, although some recent research on capital has concluded that this idea is simply wrong. But Warren, with backing from some affordable housing nonprofit groups, is pushing to reduce capital levels in the name of cheaper mortgages. When they were taken over, Fannie and Freddie backed about $5.5 trillion worth of mortgages, and they burned through $78 billion of their own capital and more than $187 billion in taxpayer funds -- combined capital a bit less than 4.9 percent of the total mortgage book. Johnson-Crapo requires each regulated bond insurer to take on a 10 percent threshold, although it doesn't define what would count as capital (some kinds of debt are often permitted). Warren wants to bring that number down, and accompany it with a serious affordable housing mandate to prevent the new system from locking out creditworthy borrowers of modest means.If one believes that deeper capital reserves make things more expensive, then one must strike a balance between protecting taxpayers with capital buffers and serving the market with affordable mortgages.And then there are the very real political considerations. Even if Warren could cut a deal that included affordable housing standards and eliminated the most noxious of the public-private partnerships, she would still need to protect the core reforms on the Senate floor. The House, meanwhile, is pushing a bill that would simply eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and let the market do what it will. Reconciling the two bills would be difficult, and given the political gulf between the chambers, the possibility of reaching such an agreement in 2014 borders on fantasy. If Democrats hold on to the Senate in the November elections, Brown is likely to serve as the next chairman of the banking committee, giving a Wall Street watchdog and Warren ally more leverage over a bill to chart the future of Fannie and Freddie. On the other hand, if Republicans take the Senate, any deal Democrats could get becomes that much less favorable to the party's core constituents. Then there's always the status quo.""I think it's a good idea to try and move the ball,"" said the Urban League's Morial, ""but a deal that doesn't create a system that's better than the current system is not one that we can support."""

There are some serious cut-and-dry cases when surgery is the only option. However, what if your knee is sore but there was no pop and no swelling, and it just hurts after walking or exercise?First of all, you need to discover the cause of the pain. The start of any good diagnosis is a careful history and physical exam. If it's not improving, X-rays and especially a high-field, high-quality MRI add significantly to the accuracy of the diagnosis. (Pro athletes get MRIs for every ache and pain.)If the diagnosis is a minor injury to the ligaments or soft tissues, you won't need surgery, but there is a lot that can be done. Non-operative care of knee joint injuries has vastly improved over the past 10 years and the thinking has changed in a number of key areas.The first focus of treatment is gentle soft-tissue manipulation. Soft-tissue physical therapy has advanced considerably from the old days of ultrasound and massage. Specific tissue mobilizations dramatically improve range of motion and healing of injuries all over the body.The way this manipulation works is that collagen cells that make up our connective tissue have mechanoreceptors, or fine hairlike projections, that when stimulated release enzymes that both break down damaged tissue and stimulate new collagen (repair tissue) formation.So rather than have the body form a scar, we want to stimulate it along the natural lines of stress to form strong, normal repair tissue. The massage also gets rid of the swelling. Swelling stretches out the tissues and slows healing.ICE (ice-compression-elevation) is still a favorite method of reducing pain and swelling. However, there are now technologically-advanced devices, such as the Game Ready units, that can improve on this by providing both cyclic pneumatic pressure and ice simultaneously.Meanwhile, the R (rest) from RICE has been dropped. Total rest is banned and exercise is now encouraged. We promote relative rest, which includes vigorous exercise of most of the body while protecting the injured joint. Pool exercises, Pilates, yoga, weight training while lying supine, healthy-leg bike spinning are all great techniques for working out hard while protecting a single joint. The exercise stimulates the natural endorphins, adrenaline, testosterone and pheromones that promote healing and wellbeing.Finally, injured tissues can also be stimulated to repair by a treatment of injecting growth factors called PRP, made from your own peripheral blood platelets. A little of your blood is spun to concentrate the platelets and release the growth factors. The concentrated factors are then injected into the injured area -- if in a joint then also in combination with hyaluronic acid -- to stimulate tissue healing. The data is mixed, but there is little downside (except cost) from trying the injections.One caution when treating your painful knee is to avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The classic anti-inflammatory is Ibuprofen, such as Advil or Motrin, which is commonly used to treat pain and inflammation. However, studies [1] have shown that taking NSAIDs may inhibit your body's ability to heal. These drugs have been proven to weaken collagen and bone formation, the very tissues we are trying to heal after injury.Studies [2] of injured medial collateral ligaments in the knee joint demonstrated weaker healing with more scarring when non-steroidal drugs were used. Bone healing after stress fractures has also shown to be delayed.The reason for this is that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories inhibit the prostaglandins (Cox 1 and 2) that stimulate DNA production and regulate the activities of tissue repair. Taking NSAIDs may diminish the pain but will unfortunately slow the healing.If you have a minor injury that's causing you pain, take action to help it heal and use your injury as a stimulus to train other parts of your body.There's plenty you can do to speed your recovery and return as a fitter, faster and stronger athlete.References: [1 ]Mishra D et al (1995) Anti-inflammatory medication after muscle injury.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has said Syria has become a matter of homeland security.The FBI has dozens of investigations under way on American fighters who have gone to Syria and made their way home, Holder said.Intelligence that bomb makers in Yemen have been joining forces in Syria with the foreign fighters is particularly concerning, he added.""That's a deadly combination, where you have people who have the technical know-how along with the people who have this kind of fervor to give their lives in support of a cause that is directed at the United States and directed at its allies,"" Holder said in the interview that was recorded last week.A Nigerian man who attempted to detonate explosives on a flight from Amsterdam to Michigan in 2009, and who became known as the underwear bomber, was linked to an extremist group that operates in Yemen.Last week, Holder urged countries in Europe and elsewhere to do more to keep their citizens from traveling to Syria to fight, saying they could learn from U.S. efforts to conduct undercover sting operations.Holder said Sunni extremists flowing into Iraq from Syria who have seized towns in the North do not yet represent a threat to the West. But that could change.""If they are able to consolidate their gains in that area, I think it's just a matter of time before they start looking at the West and at the United States in particular,"" he said.Earlier this month, a Denver woman accused of trying to fly to Syria to support insurgents there was arrested in the United States, and last month two men in central Texas were arrested on similar charges.One of the Texas men was charged with ""attempting to provide material support to terrorists,"" violating a law that Holder urged other countries to copy.

He managed to capture an unusual moment that many fans watching on television might have missed. As Argentina and Germany battled, the teams were briefly joined by an uninvited pitch invader. James came through with the video and the ""Old School"" reference that everyone on Twitter needed."
