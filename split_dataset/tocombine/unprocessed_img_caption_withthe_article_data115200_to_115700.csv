Ukraine and pro-Russian insurgents agreed on July 19 to set up a security zone around the crash site of a Malaysian jet whose downing in the rebel-held east has drawn global condemnation of the Kremlin. Outraged world leaders have demanded Russia's immediate cooperation in a prompt and independent probe into the shooting down on July 17 of flight MH17 with 298 people on board. AFP PHOTO / DOMINIQUE FAGET (Photo credit should read DOMINIQUE FAGET/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13a8d2400004f0024eab1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"* Ukraine says rebels hamper access to crash site* Rebels say Kiev dragging its feet, black boxes not found* Ukraine says experienced Russian crew fired fatal missile (Adds British comment, State Department statement on Kerry-Lavrov phone call; in paragraphs 7-8, 13, 21)By Anton Zverev and Peter GraffHRABOVE/DONETSK, Ukraine, July 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine accused Russia and pro-Moscow rebels on Saturday of destroying evidence to cover up their guilt in the shooting down of a Malaysian airliner that has accelerated a showdown between the Kremlin and Western powers.As militants kept international monitors away from wreckage and scores of bodies festered for a third day, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged the rebels to cooperate and insisted that a U.N.-mandated investigation must not leap to conclusions. Moscow denies involvement and has pointed a finger at Kiev's military.The Dutch government, whose citizens made up most of the 298 aboard MH17 from Amsterdam, said it was ""furious"" at the manhandling of corpses strewn for miles over open country and asked Ukraine's president for help to bring ""our people"" home.After U.S. President Barack Obama said the loss of the Kuala Lumpur-bound flight showed it was time to end the conflict, Germany called it Moscow's last chance to cooperate.European powers seemed to swing behind Washington's belief Russia's separatist allies were to blame. That might speed new trade sanctions on Moscow, without waiting for definitive proof.""He has one last chance to show he means to help,"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said after a telephone call to Putin.Britain, which lost 10 citizens, said further sanctions were available for use against Russia. ""If Russia is the principal culprit, we can take further action against them and make it clear this kind of sponsored war is completely unacceptable,"" Defense Minister Michael Fallon told the Mail on Sunday.Prime Minister David Cameron, writing in The Sunday Times, said European countries should make their power count in dealing with the Ukraine crisis, ""yet we sometimes behave as if we need Russia more than Russia needs us.""German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the most powerful figure in the EU, spoke to Putin on Saturday, urging his cooperation. Merkel's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, told Bild am Sonntag newspaper: ""Moscow may have a last chance now to show that it really is seriously interested in a solution.""""Now is the moment for everyone to stop and think to themselves what might happen if we don't stop the escalation.""Germany, reliant like other EU states on Russian energy and more engaged in Russian trade than the United States, has been reluctant to escalate a confrontation with Moscow that has revived memories of the Cold War. But with military action not seen as an option, economic leverage is a vital instrument.RUSSIAN RETALIATIONRussia said on Saturday it was retaliating against sanctions imposed by the United States last week, before the air disaster, by barring entry to unnamed Americans and warned of a ""boomerang effect"" on U.S. business. But Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry did agree in a phone call to try to get both sides in Ukraine to reach a consensus on peace, Russia's Foreign Ministry said.The State Department, however, put the onus on Russia, saying Kerry urged Russia to take ""immediate and clear actions to reduce tensions in Ukraine.""Driving home its assertion that the Boeing 777 was hit by a Russian SA-11 radar-guided missile, Ukraine's Western-backed government said it had ""compelling evidence"" the battery was not just brought in from Russia but manned by three Russian citizens who had now taken the truck-mounted system back over the border.The prime minister, denying Russian suggestions that Kiev's forces had fired a missile, said only a ""very professional"" crew could have brought down the speeding jetliner from 33,000 feet (10,000 meters) - not ""drunken gorillas"" among the ill-trained insurgents who want the Russian-speaking east to be annexed by Moscow.Fighting flared in eastern Ukraine on Saturday. The government said it was pressing its offensive in the east.Observers from Europe's OSCE security agency visited part of the crash site near the village of Hrabove for a second day on Saturday and again found their access hampered by armed men from the forces of the self-declared People's Republic of Donetsk. An OSCE official said, however, they saw more than on Friday.At one point, a Reuters correspondent heard a senior rebel tell the OSCE delegation they could not approach the wreckage and would simply be informed in due course of an investigation conducted by the separatists. However, fighters later let them visit an area where one of the airliner's two engines lay.""The terrorists, with the help of Russia, are trying to destroy evidence of international crimes,"" the Ukrainian government said in a statement. ""The terrorists have taken 38 bodies to the morgue in Donetsk,"" it said, accusing people with ""strong Russian accents"" of threatening to conduct autopsies.Ukraine's prime minister said armed men had barred government experts from collecting evidence.Kerry told Lavrov the United States is ""very concerned"" over reports that the remains of victims and debris from the crash site have been removed or tampered with, the State Department said. He said Washington was also concerned over denial of ""proper access"" for international investigators and OSCE monitors, it said.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko urged the United Nations on Saturday to label rebels fighting his forces in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk as belonging to ""terrorist organizations"".RETRIEVING REMAINSIn the regional capital Donetsk, the prime minister of the separatist authorities told a news conference that Kiev was holding up the arrival of international experts whose mission to probe the cause - and potentially blame - for the disaster was authorized on Friday by the United Nations Security Council.And contrary to earlier statements by the rebels, Alexander Borodai said they had not found the black box flight recorders. He said rebels were avoiding disturbing the area.""There's a grandmother. A body landed right in her bed. She says 'please take this body away'. But we cannot tamper with the site,"" Borodai said. ""Bodies of innocent people are lying out in the heat. We reserve the right, if the delay continues ... to begin the process of taking away the bodies. We ask the Russian Federation to help us with this problem and send their experts.""Midday temperatures are around 30 Celsius (85 Fahrenheit).At Hrabove, one armed man from the separatist forces told Reuters that bodies had already been taken away in trucks. Another said that immediately after the crash people had looted valuables. But fighters and local people say they have been doing their best to collect evidence and preserve human remains.As the stench of death began to pervade the area after Thursday's crash, correspondents watched rescue workers carry bodies across the fields and gather remains in black sacks.Meeting Ukrainian President Poroshenko in Kiev, Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans said: ""We are already shocked by the news we got today of bodies being dragged around, of the site not being treated properly ... People are angry, furious.""The Ukrainian security council in Kiev said staff of the Emergencies Ministry had found 186 bodies and had checked some 18 sq km (seven square miles) of the scattered 25-sq-km (10-square-mile) crash site. But the workers were not free to conduct a normal investigation.""The fighters have let the Emergencies Ministry workers in there but they are not allowing them to take anything from the area,"" security council spokesman Andriy Lysenko said. ""The fighters are taking away all that has been found.""Malaysia, whose national airline has been battered by its second major disaster this year, said it was ""inhumane"" to bar access to the site around the village of Hrabove, but said Russia was doing its ""level best"" to help.A team of Malaysian experts flew in to Kiev on Saturday and experts from Interpol are due there on Sunday to help with the identification of victims. Dutch, U.S. and a host of other specialists are being lined up to help in the investigation.As tales of personal grief unfolded, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak revealed his own family was involved - his 83-year-old step-grandmother had been aboard the flight.The United Nations said 80 children were aboard. The deadliest attack on a commercial airliner follows the disappearance of flight MH370 in March with 239 passengers.Malaysia Airlines has defended its use of the route, 1,000 feet (300 meters) above the area closed by Ukraine due to the hostilities. Some airlines had been avoiding the area, though many others were flying over. The issue has raised questions of liability for the deaths and damage and about international supervisors' roles.The scale of the disaster could prove a turning point for international pressure to resolve the crisis in Ukraine, which has killed hundreds since pro-Western protests toppled the Moscow-backed president in Kiev in February and Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula a month later.

Now they seem to own him. That trend continued Saturday at Royal Liverpool as he made triple and double bogeys while shooting 73 in conditions conducive to low scoring.Woods hasn’t shot in the 60s on a major weekend since his closing 67 at the 2011 Masters. He has averaged 72.6 in his 17 major weekend rounds since then.This time, he hasn’t found his groove while coming back from March 31 microdiscectomy. He was rusty in missing the cut by four strokes three weeks ago at Quicken Loans National. He has been inconsistent here at the Open Championship in shooting 3-over-par 69-77-73—219. He looked like a dangerous contender on opening day but finds himself 19 strokes behind leader Rory McIlroy after 54 holes.“I’m starting to get the flow of the round, the flow of playing again,” said the 38-year-old Woods, winner of 14 major titles through June 2008, including the 2006 Open here. “But still I’ve just made too many mistakes. You can’t run up high scores like that and expect to contend, especially when the conditions are this benign.”Woods has made a triple and double bogey in each of his last two rounds. Starting on No. 10 on a rainy Saturday that featured an unusual two-tee start because of a bad weather forecast, Woods began birdie-birdie and was 3 under going to his 11th hole (No. 2) while playing on rain-softened turf and in calm air.But he drove into a pot bunker on the 454-yard second, blasted to the fairway, spun a wedge shot off the front of the green, lag-putted to 4 feet and missed. That hole has caused him problems. He bogeyed it the first two days and played it in 1-over when winning here eight years ago.He tripled the 480-yard seventh after hitting iron off the tee into a gorse bush on the right. The search party found several balls in and around the bush, but none his. Hence he went back to the tee, as he did after driving out of bounds while making triple bogey at 17 the day before. As with that Friday scenario, Woods again found the left rough with his re-teed drive. He hacked out, reached the green in five and two-putted from 40 feet.Woods did make five birdies, compared with only a closing one in the second round, but he couldn’t overcome the blowup holes.“Made a lot of mistakes,” he said in a brief Q&A session. “I’ve made two doubles and two triples. But on top of that I missed a lot of shots for opportunities for birdies.” "

But perhaps we should read what the law actually is. And it turns out that not only is he following the law, but Republicans were among the ones who put together the bill that's leading to the crisis.Obama is following the ""William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008."" Named for the famed English politician who eventually led Great Britain to ban slavery, the law is meant to combat human trafficking. The kids who are trying to enter America are supposed to be detained, and get a fair hearing, to ensure that they aren't victims of human trafficking, a modern-day slavery. The bill covers children from three Latin American countries: El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.The bill was co-sponsored by Republicans are Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida and Chris Smith of New Jersey. It was also co-sponsored by Democrats John Conyers of Michigan, Zoe Lofgren of California, and Bobby Scott of Virginia. The original sponsor was Howard Berman, a California Democrat.That law was signed by President George W. Bush on December 23, 2008, while most of us were more concerned with the specter of a stock market meltdown and double-digit unemployment. Obama didn't become president until the following month, yet he's being held accountable for this bill supported by the GOP.  The U.S. border with Mexico, at night, from El Paso, Texas, taken by the author. In an attempt at bipartisanship, Obama met with Texas Governor Rick Perry, considering a presidential run himself. For his trouble, Obama got nothing but scorn.Perry told ABC's This Week that ""I have to believe that when you do not respond in any way, that you are either inept or you have some ulterior motive.""Obama then went to Congress with an emergency request for $3.7 billion. But he hasn't made much headway with the House of Representatives. Congressman Hal Rogers, the House Appropriations Chair, said ""It's too much money. We don't need it,"" at a press conference.Others found other reasons to reject the request to deal with the problem. One claimed that Obama shouldn't get a blank check, even though a specific amount was requested (and here's a list of what the money would go for). Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn said that the money would probably go to Obamacare, so she wouldn't support it. Texas Republican Representative John Carter contended that Obama shouldn't get a bailout.Throughout it all, Republicans have yet to eliminate the Wilberforce bill, or standardize it with the policy toward Mexico, or even accept the emergency request to deal with problem. Republicans did demand changes in the bill and the Obama administration agreed with them. So what's holding up the GOP from acting on these changes? It's not clear at this moment.John A.

Art historians do not deny the absence of a Semitic Jewish Jesus in Renaissance artworks. However, they attribute the omissions to technical developments in art, such as the introduction of realism, naturalism, the Renaissance style of contemporizing figures in appearance, dress and setting, and the revival of Greek idealism -- but not to a theological justification that the omissions were acceptable because Jesus started or converted to Christianity. Furthermore, the content of art was determined by the buyers -- rich patrons who commissioned strictly Christianized art, as confirmed by Renaissance art expert Michael Baxandall.Is Bill O'Reilly saying, in his rejection of my critique of Renaissance art, that the denial of Jesus' Jewish heritage in artworks is justified because Jesus was a Christian? If so, that's even more baffling since in O'Reilly's book, Killing Jesus, the disciples and followers address Jesus as ""rabbi"" right up to the crucifixion. Jesus in a Landscape by Jan Swart Van Groningen -- Musée des beaux-arts de MontréalI'm also puzzled by O'Reilly's dismissal of my commentary on the image of Jesus holding a crucifix staff. The depiction of Jesus by Renaissance artist Jan Swart Van Groningen is a blatant anachronism. Christianity did not exist in Jesus' lifetime and the cross was hated and feared in the first century; the cross did not become a Christian symbol until the fourth century -- and even then as a battle symbol, not a devotional object. As I stated in the article, the only cross that Jesus ever held was the one he was nailed to in his brutal crucifixion. Yet the visual statement of the painting that Jesus was a Christian is simply false. Furthermore, the term Christian does not appear in the Gospels, which chronicles Jesus' life and mission. But the word Jew has 82 mentions. And nowhere in the Gospels does Jesus say he has rejected Judaism and is starting a new religion. The ideal time for Jesus to have announced a new religion -- if he believed he had -- was at his trial for blasphemy against Judaism before the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin, the ruling body of Judaism, only had jurisdiction over Jews and Jewish affairs. If the Sanhedrin could indict anyone for blasphemy against Judaism, all Roman Pagans would have been charged. If Jesus had proclaimed, ""I'm not a Jew any longer, I'm a Christian,"" at the very least that would have initiated an interesting legal debate. But the issue of a new religion is never even hinted at in the Gospels. And if Jesus started a new religion, as O'Reilly maintains, why didn't Jesus' disciples know that? After the crucifixion, the disciples led by Peter and Jesus' brother James, continued to identify themselves as Jews and they worshipped at the Temple in Jerusalem. Also, they gave Paul, who many claim was the actual founder of Christianity, a hard time for his defections from Orthodox Judaism.So many biblical scholars have noted that Jesus was a dedicated practicing Jew throughout his life that it's surprising that Bill O'Reilly would insist otherwise. In my book, Jesus Uncensored: Restoring the Authentic Jew, I wrote about a discussion of Jesus, Judaism, and Christianity by a panel of three eminent biblical scholars at the Center for Jewish History in New York City. Father Donald Senior, president of the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago, Anglican priest Dr. Bruce Chilton, author of Rabbi Jesus, and Rabbi Jacob Neusner, author of numerous books on religion, including several about early Christianity, all agreed that Jesus was born and died a practicing Jew. Former Catholic priest James Carroll, in his book Constantine's Sword, goes a step further in fast forwarding Jesus to the present with this question: ""If Jesus were alive today, would he be one of those fervent black-hatted figures dovening [praying] at the Western Wall [the remnant of Herrod's Jerusalem Temple]?""All that said, fact is that Jesus life, teachings, and death did inspire a new religion. But Jesus did not launch it. Also, if Jesus had explicitly defected from Judaism and had explicitly said he was starting a new religion it's doubtful that he would have had any followers--and then we probably never would have heard of him or Christianity. Wouldn't it would be better and more useful to celebrate the common ground of Judaism and Christianity rather than manufacturing divisive spins? Perhaps that's what Pope Francis was suggesting in his statement: ""Inside every Christian is a Jew.""Bernard Starr, PhD, is a psychologist, journalist and professor emeritus at the City University of New York (Brooklyn College).

Sources familiar with the deal have told Reuters the talks are progressing well but that there are still many areas they need to find agreement on.BSkyB, which declined to comment, has history in making expensive but ultimately winning gambles.Back in 2006, it set out plans to offer broadband for free, spooking analysts and investors who feared the gamble would be costly, but the strategy paid off by luring new customers who took its other subscription services. It also led the way in investing in high definition programming, which also proved extremely popular, boosting the amount customers paid each month.Analysts and investors are divided over whether the new deal is aimed at creating scale so it can better compete with new online challengers such as Netflix or is more a reflection of Sky's saturated home market, which is forcing it to look overseas to find growth.Many see the hand of Murdoch behind the deal since it would give Fox billions of euros in cash at a time when the 83-year old mogul is looking to expand in content.Fox revealed on Wednesday it had tried and so far failed to buy media conglomerate Time Warner Inc, with a source putting the price at roughly $80 billion.A separate source close to the Sky talks said they did not expect Murdoch to raise his holding in BSkyB, which would be contentious in Britain, where rivals and some politicians believe he controls too much of the media. APPEALING TO THE MASSESBSkyB, which is facing a new challenge at home from telecoms group BT, which is aggressively bidding for content and customers, would expand its potential market to 95 million households by moving into Italy and Germany.A larger group would be able to better absorb higher programming costs, co-produce content and be well placed to buy broadcasting rights on a pan-European basis if that ever replaces the current country-by-country basis.It could also save some costs on procurement and back-office functions, while generating increased revenue by rolling out services into Italy and Germany that have sold well in Britain, such as targeted advertising and betting services.Analysts however are divided over the potential cost and revenue synergies for the deal, with Berenberg struggling to see meaningful savings, while UBS forecasts synergies of up to 380 million pounds per year.""This is not a massive synergy story,"" Berenberg analyst Sarah Simon said. ""It's more about accessing higher growth because these are markets with low penetration.""However, it could take a while for the benefits of creating a so-called Sky Europe to pay off, as the risks of entering Germany and Italy are not inconsequential.Sky Italia, 100 percent owned by Fox, is Italy's biggest pay-TV operator in a market where those willing to pay for TV has slumped during the downturn, to 34 percent of households in 2013 from almost 40 percent just four years earlier, according to Bernstein Research.With its 4.75 million subscribers unable to provide much revenue growth, Sky Italia has kept a tight lid on costs.Against that background it did well in late June to win exclusive rights to more Serie A soccer matches at roughly the same price as before, but it has lost the Champions League matches to rival Mediaset Premium, owned by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's TV group Mediaset. GERMAN QUESTIONSIn Germany, the market is less constrained by economic pressures than by long-established habit.According to industry research, less than 20 percent of German households pay for television, well below the 54 percent in Britain, due in part to the strong position of German free-to-air TV.While the Sky Deutschland business is growing strongly in terms of customer additions and revenue, due to the appeal of its soccer programming, it has not made an operating profit in recent years and is only expected to turn positive next year, according to Reuters data.BSkyB is unlikely to radically change the way the business is run - Sky Deutschland's CEO Brian Williams spent 13 years at BSkyB - but the timing of the deal in terms of its recovery and growth profile could be good for the British firm.A large factor in whether BSkyB shareholders will back the deal will be whether it acquires all of Sky Deutschland or just the 57 percent owned by Fox. Under German takeover rules a deal for the Fox stake would trigger a mandatory offer for the rest.That in turn would affect how much BSkyB would need to pay, and whether it would need to issue equity or pay for the deal with debt and cash. On Thursday it said it had sold a 6.4 percent stake in British broadcaster ITV for 481 million pounds to cable group Liberty Global.That move by Liberty, which is in 12 European countries and has recently invested in a small content producer, also shows why the Sky assets may need to join forces in the region if they are going to be competing against ever larger groups.If the price is between 7 billion and 10 billion euros, BSkyB's net debt could rise to more than three times its core earnings from the current level of around one. That in turn could force it to temper its share buyback and dividend programs.Analysts at Nomura warned that that could also leave BSkyB vulnerable in its fight with BT when it comes to bidding for Premier League soccer rights.The two, which spent more than 3 billion pounds in 2012 to share the rights for three years, are likely to go head to head again in the auction for the three seasons beginning with the 2016/17 campaign.Were BSkyB to push ahead with the European deal, it would need to strike the right balance between investing in Britain to ward off BT while growing its two new assets in Europe.""BSkyB has always been a company with a great history of innovation and bold risk taking,"" Numis analyst Paul Richards said. ""The challenges within the two assets are both a drawback and an opportunity."" (Additional reporting by Sophie Sassard; Writing by Kate Holton; Editing by Will Waterman)"

It is a derivative, unfunny concept. The 2007 movie I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry had a similar plot line. Despite attempts to show that the men in that film become enlightened about gay experience after pretending to be in love, the ""hilarity"" in the climax of the film revolves around the men's gay panic when forced to kiss each other. Gay panic is not side-splitting entertainment. It is insulting.2. Final season plot revisions do not work. Remember the last season of Roseanne? They won the lottery and lost their audience. Remember when The Golden Girls morphed into The Golden Palace? Nobody wanted to see those lovable senior gals checking people into a hotel.3. Jumping the shark... twice? Does the show really want to do that?4. Gay adoption is not so simple. Tassler claims that Ashton Kutcher's character ""realizes it's very difficult to adopt a child as a single, straight man."" So to make it easier, he pretends to be gay? Because it is smoother sailing for gay couples to adopt? Audiences will bust a gut laughing at the ease with which gay couples can adopt a child, right?5. The concept is insensitive. Tassler did not understand how the plot line could bother members of the gay community. She said, ""It's like, 'You know what, I'm going to adopt a child as a gay couple,' and, it's like, the reality is he can do that, and in a universe when at one point you couldn't do that and now you can do that, I think that's a much more positive statement that he's making."" What universe does she, like, live in? Perhaps she should, like, sit and watch the show with gay parents in Mississippi and see how funny they think it is.6. Same-sex marriage does not equal comedy. Tassler says, ""We're gonna talk about this and we're gonna laugh about it."" I have a good sense of humor, but... can't you find something else to make us laugh? Why are we gays so amusing to the rest of you? Just this past week, Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association also found gays to be real humdingers: ""It's almost comical that we have allowed these people to have so much power in our culture where they can force their deviant lifestyle into the public sphere."" Maybe Tassler and Fischer need to look up the definition for ""comedy.""7. Two and Half Men is not Three's Company.  Jack Tripper pretended to be gay (so he could room with two women) way back in 1977. That was more than 35 years ago. Ashton Kutcher wasn't even born yet. Isn't there a more novel way to breathe fresh air into an old show nowadays?7.5. The title of the show is limiting. Maybe the show needs an adoption to add back the ""half"" to Two and Half Men? There are other alternatives. The show could be re-titled: Two Men. HBO's Girls is doing fine without having to explicitly define its numbers in the title. So why not call it Men? Oh, what the hell -- just call it The Odd Couple and be done with it.Admittedly, I am judging this concept before seeing the results. Perhaps the show will break new ground. LOL. Now that's funny!"

The dramatic humanitarian nature of children rushing to the U.S. border has catapulted the issue of immigration back on the national agenda. There has been a significant increase in public attention and a new fervor to solve the intergovernmental puzzle that is immigration policy in the United States. The time frame for the issue being on the agenda will likely be limited as eventually the public will grow weary of the story and realize the difficulty in bringing about a meaningful solution. This is generally followed by a sharp decline in public enthusiasm and interest and the dropping of the immigration issue from the legislative agenda. This process of getting ""problems"" onto the nation's agenda can be characterized as the ""problem stream"" of political theorist John Kingdon's multiple streams theory. His theory posited that when three streams (the problem stream, politics stream, and policy stream) are joined then a policy window is able to open up. Policy windows open up very infrequently and often close shortly after they are opened. For example, the March on Washington and Birmingham campaign of 1963 created the climate in the problem stream that led to the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The politics stream was represented by President Lyndon Johnson's 68 seat majority in the U.S. Senate and the policy stream had been in place through proposed measures like New York Congressman Adam Clayton Powell's ""Powell Amendment"" that required that federal funds be denied to any jurisdiction that maintained segregation. This amendment was eventually integrated into the Civil Rights Act of 1964 after the policy window had been opened. It had previously been rejected on bill after bill because the policy window was closed.With the problem stream now in place in the area of immigration; potential policy solutions and improvements are there amongst the hodgepodge of previous proposals in the area of immigration from the D.R.E.A.M. Act to the Senate's Gang of Eight proposal. The biggest hurdle to opening the policy window has been the politics stream in this current political environment of hyper-partisanship. This hurdle has the potential to be overcome by the growing pressure that is now being placed on both political parties to produce legislation. Political interests as divergent as liberal Senators like Robert Menendez of New Jersey to conservative Senators like Ted Cruz of Texas are now saying that it is imperative to pass immigration reform measures. The upcoming midterm elections and the growing Hispanic voter population that is disproportionately impacted from the lack of comprehensive immigration reform legislation may be enough to put the crucial politics stream in place. It will take continued vigilance from everyone on the issue of immigration reform to push pass the political grandstanding and posturing to a demand for Congress to take advantage of this open policy window to pass meaningful comprehensive immigration reform. Fifty years after the passage of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act we may be on the cusp of passing another historic piece of legislation if have the focus and endurance to make it happen.Marcus Bright, Ph.D. is the Executive Director of Education for a Better America and an Adjunct Professor in the School of Public Administration at Florida International University and Florida Atlantic University"

Almost always the earliest theories turn out to be either totally off-base or at best incomplete. The media would be wise to exercise as much restraint as possible. We live in an age when people want and expect instant answers, but that just isn't possible when it comes to things like this. There are too many variables, too many people and parts involved: airplane, crew, air traffic control, government and military entities. What exactly happened to flight MH17 is liable to be complex, and possibly a combination of errors involving different parties.It is fairly routine for civilian jetliners to overfly areas of conflict. Dozens of airline flights pass each day over Baghdad, for example (many of them land there). I have personally piloted flights over eastern Ukraine, close to where the Malaysia Airlines 777 met its fate on Thursday.There are protocols, as you'd think. Flights are sometimes restricted to particular routes, specific altitudes and airspace sectors. Large chunks of airspace are often totally off limits. Over certain countries -- Afghanistan, for instance -- commercial overflights might be prohibited outright. Compliance with these restrictions is important, but they are not difficult to follow. Thousands of flights deal with them every day. Crews don't simply wander unknowingly into dangerous airspace. On the ground, air traffic controllers are fully aware of who will be passing over, and when.The FAA had already taken the unusual step of prohibiting U.S.-registered jets from the area the Malaysia flight was traversing. Whether this was due to safety concerns or bureaucratic concerns isn't clear. In any case the airspace was open, and was being used routinely by European and Asian airlines.This is not the first time a civilian jetliner has been shot down -- accidentally or otherwise. There have been several such incidents over the years. Most notoriously, at least until now, was the Soviet destruction of Korean Air Lines flight 007 in 1983 -- a Boeing 747 flying from New York to Seoul that strayed off course -- and the accidental downing of an Iran Air Airbus A300 by the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes in 1988.Ironically and tragically, the 295 reported fatalities from Flight 17 make it the seventh deadliest disaster in aviation history -- the same spot of infamy held previously by the Vincennes incident. The KAL 007 disaster was, until today, the tenth worst, meaning that three of history's eleven worst crashes were planes brought down by missiles.That doesn't mean we should expect or accept such things, but sadly they are not unheard of.And what a double-dose of agonizing luck, meanwhile, for Malaysia Airlines. One of the world's most highly regarded carriers has lost two Boeing 777s in less than a year's span, with neither accident likely being its fault.Patrick Smith is an active airline pilot, air travel blogger and author.

Ready for Hillary, which supports a bid for president by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is a co-sponsor of Netroots Nation and contributed $10,000 to the gathering in May. Clinton did not attend the event, but her supporters made sure they were visible, bringing their prominent Ready for Hillary bus, participating in sessions at the conference and signing up to co-host one of its major parties Friday night.Vice President Joe Biden, who has also been mentioned as a potential candidate in 2016, made his first Netroots Nation appearance on Thursday. Biden received an enthusiastic welcome, but there were no chants for him to run for president, and he faced heckling from a handful of immigration activists. While in Detroit, Warren is also campaigning with Rep. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) Friday afternoon to promote his bid for U.S. Senate. Scenes from the event:Want more updates from Amanda?

John McCain (R-AZ) participates in a discussion on the unfolding violence in Iraq on June 18, 2014 at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research in Washington, DC. The rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) over the last year and a decline in the power of the government in Baghdad has led to questions of what America gained from its costly efforts in the region.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) says he would have been hesitant about ordering a ground invasion of Iraq had he been elected president in 2000.“You’ll find this surprising, but I think I would’ve been more reluctant to commit American troops,” McCain said at CNN’s “Politics on Tap” event in Washington on Thursday.The persistent war hawk, who endorsed George W. Bush after failing to pick up sufficient steam in the 2000 presidential race, said his foreign policy experience would have aided him in seeing past dubious evidence that ultimately led to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.“I think I would have challenged the evidence with more scrutiny,” McCain said, as quoted by CNN. “I hope that I would have been able to see through the evidence that was presented at the time.""Interviewed by CNN’s Jake Tapper and National Journal’s Ron Fournier, McCain said he would have relied on the credibility of former Secretary of State Colin Powell.“If presented with that same evidence today, I would vote the same way,” McCain said. “I respected and trusted the secretary of state, Colin Powell. But it’s obvious now, in retrospect, that Saddam Hussein -- although he had used weapons of mass destruction -- did not have the inventory that we seem to have evidence of. Which now looking back on it, with the benefit of hindsight, [the evidence] was very flimsy.”But McCain said his comments weren't intended to be a critique of the Bush administration.“I’m not blaming President George W. Bush,"" he said. ""It’s not for me to critique my predecessors, especially those that I lost to.""The Arizona Republican is once again calling for an increased U.S. presence in Iraq, faulting President Barack Obama for the militant insurgency that has upended the country once more."

McDonald's restaurants in San Francisco found a way to comply with a city law that bans free toy giveaways with Happy Meals: charge 10 cents for the toys. San Francisco became the first major U.S. city to prohibit fast food restaurants from including toys with children's meals that don't meet certain nutritional guidelines. The law takes effect Thursday, Dec. 1, 2011.

It made it so that fast-food companies couldn’t give away toys in kids meals unless they met certain nutritional criteria, such as fewer than 600 calories, inclusion of fruit and vegetables, and less than 640mg of sodium.Instead of meeting these standards, fast-food companies started charging for toys rather than including them for free.Read more on The Wall Street Journal"
