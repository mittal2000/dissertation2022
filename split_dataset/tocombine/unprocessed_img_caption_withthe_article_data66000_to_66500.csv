3,HEALTHY LIVING,Reaching For Your Fourth Cup Of Joe? Here's How To Cut Back,"Samantha Costa, U.S. News & World Report",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/caffeine-health-effects_us_5693c89ee4b0c8beacf7c208,Adults should consume no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day.,2016-01-31,"Coffee (Or At Least, The Caffeine!) Can Help You Proofread Better ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ca3f4d170000b70056734e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"""Don't talk to me until I've had my coffee.""Sound familiar?""I can't survive without caffeine.""Maybe it's just a case of the Mondays, or maybe you're unaware of exactly how much caffeine you're guzzling on a daily basis. Time for a reality check: When you're feeling that afternoon lull, do you reach for a cup of energy-boosting java or chug a Coke? How do you know if and when it's time to switch to decaf … or water?“Having caffeine later in the day can delay our inner circadian clock,"" says Dr. Mark Hyman, director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine.The mild stimulant – yes, it's defined as a drug – can disrupt sleep and promote anxiety and depression. ""We all know someone who tends to be tired, wired and over-caffeinated,"" Hyman says.The Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee suggests​ adults consume no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day. Pregnant women should hit the brakes around 200 mg ​ – or two to three cups – a day, says Roger Cook​, science manager at the ISIC, a nonprofit dedicated to the study of coffee's effects on health. For measure, a single cup of coffee packs roughly 95 to 200 mg of caffeine. ""As with many elements of our diet, too much can be harmful,"" Cook says, adding that even too much water can make you ill. ""Most consumers self-regulate – that is, they consume a level of caffeine they are comfortable with.""In 2014, researchers published a paper ​in the journal Pediatrics reporting that although caffeine is considered a safe substance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, its potential adverse effects on children and adolescents aren't certain. That's why the American Academy of Pediatrics​ recommends no caffeine for kids. Yet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 73 percent of Americans ages 2 to 22 consume caffeine on any given day. ​According to the National Institutes of Health, caffeine has no nutritional value. It's found naturally in the leaves, seeds and fruits of more than 60 plants, including tea leaves, kola nuts, coffee beans and cocoa beans. It's also found in processed foods such as instant coffee​, tea, chocolate, most colas, candies, energy drinks​​, snacks and gum. And it's an ingredient in many ​over-the-counter medications,​ such as pain relievers, diet pills and cold remedies.Benefits of CaffeineIn moderation, caffeine provides mental and physical performance benefits, Cook explains: ""Caffeine can be beneficial at improving alertness, particularly when the circadian clock is low after lunch or in the middle of a night shift,"" he says. For instance, a caffeinated beverage and a short nap can help reduce driver fatigue among those who spend long hours on the road.There's no harm in enjoying a caffeinated drink for a pre-workout boost, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics​. The group suggests a low-fat latte, which typically delivers about 120 calories, 10 grams of protein and 75 milligrams of caffeine.Coffee, in particular, has taken the spotlight in recent research. In May, the ISIC presented a report at the European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation's annual meeting, detailing multiple studies that have linked drinking coffee to improved heart health​. One such study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology​, found that drinking three to five cups of coffee each day could reduce the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease by up to 21 percent.In July, an analysis published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease revealed that the risk for mild cognitive impairment – or MCI, a stage between the normal aging process and dementia – may be influenced by how often coffee is consumed. The study examined drinking habits and cognitive function among a group of 1,445 people from the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging. Adults with normal cognitive functioning who also drank one to two cups of coffee each day, the researchers found, ​had a reduced risk​ for developing MCI compared with those who never or rarely drank coffee. It's worth noting that the findings didn't extend to heavy coffee drinkers who downed more than four cups a day – moderate amounts appeared to bring the greatest benefit.Your Body on CaffeineCaffeine affects various parts of the body in different ways, Hyman says. For some people with diabetes, just one or two 8-ounce cups of black, brewed coffee can increase or decrease blood sugar levels, according to the Mayo Clinic​. Since it's absorbed from the stomach, caffeine can reach ​the highest levels in the bloodstream within one or two hours, increasing blood pressure for a short period of time. That's why it's important for people with diabetes and high blood pressure​ to ask their doctor if caffeinated drinks are safe.When you drink caffeinated beverages such as tea, soda or coffee, greater levels of serotonin – an important neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and appetite – are released, which is why you feel that jolt of energy. Caffeine can also increase cortisol, the hormone responsible for stress control. But once the stimulation of caffeine has worn off, the fluctuation of hormones can actually leave you feeling more irritable and anxious.​Although caffeine may perk up your mood or make you feel more focused, it can't make a drunk person sober, according to the FDA. ​ And too much can lead to headaches, the jitters and irritability. ​How Much Is​ Too Much?Consider limiting​ your caffeine intake​ if you're pregnant or you find that you're having side effects​ from the stimulant.People taking certain medications and supplements should also be cautious, according to the Mayo Clinic. The antibiotics Cipro and Noroxin, for instance, can increase the amount of time caffeine stays in the bloodstream, increasing the likelihood of negative side effects, such as insomnia, nervousness, restlessness, stomach upset, irritability, fast heartbeat and muscle tremors. And caffeine can increase the potency of the respiratory illness drug theophylline, which can lead to nausea, vomiting and heart palpitations. If you're taking the herbal supplement echinacea, note that it can​ increase the amount of caffeine in your bloodstream, leading to caffeine-related side effects. In 2013, the American Psychiatric ​Association recognized caffeine withdrawal as a syndrome in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. ​To fit the criteria for diagnosis, you need to have had more than 250 mg of caffeine and experience five or more of the following symptoms: restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, diuresis, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, rambling speech, tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia, periods of inexhaustibility or psychomotor agitation.So You've Decided to Cut Back – Here's HowPay attention. Figuring out how much caffeine is in your drink, food or medication might be tricky since, for example, there isn't a nutritional chart affixed to your mug. It's up to you to do your research. You'll learn that one shot of espresso has about 75 mg of caffeine, while energy drinks can range from 47 to 163 mg of caffeine per 8 ounces, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Chocolate contains caffeine, too, so don't overlook the labels on your Hershey bar. And check over-the-counter pain relievers to determine just how much caffeine is in a single dose. For example, two tablets of Excedrin Migraine – which is the recommended dosage – contain 130 mg of caffeine.Cut back gradually. If you’re afraid you'll get a headache or feel tired if you go cold turkey, try decreasing your intake over a few days or more. Cook says that cautiously decreasing the amount of caffeine you consume may prevent you from developing the withdrawal-like symptoms described in the DSM-V.Consider other options. While decaf might sound blasphemous to coffee chuggers, one 8-ounce cup contains a much milder amount of caffeine: 2 to 12 mg. If you’re still craving the bitter stuff, try a single shot of espresso, which packs 47 to 75 mg of caffeine. Tea can also​ help lower caffeine consumption. One 8-ounce cup of black tea holds 14 to 70 mg of caffeine, and an 8-ounce bottle of ice tea ranges from 5 to 40 mg. Most ​clear sodas, such as ginger ales and lemon-lime flavors, are 100 percent caffeine-free. It depends on the brand, though, so make sure to check the label on your favorite fizzy drink. If you're trying to cure a headache and don't want any more caffeine than you've already had, try ​​regular ibuprofen, aspirin or Tylenol – as opposed to those with additional medications for multiple symptoms. ​Your Body On Caffeine: When Enough Is Enough was originally published on U.S. News & World Report.More from U.S. News:10 Ways to Break a Bad Mood7 Ways Technology Can Torpedo Your Health8 Steps to Fall Asleep FastAlso on HuffPost:"

6,POLITICS,An Iowa Voter Forced Ted Cruz To Confront The Human Toll Of Repealing Obamacare,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-obamacare-iowa_us_56ad66a1e4b077d4fe8e6396,Republicans have nothing to offer the millions who would lose insurance.,2016-01-31,"Ted Cruz offered his usual schtick about Obamacare, but one man in Iowa was having none of it.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ad67631a00002d00ab1a9b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republicans have spent nearly six years promising to repeal Obamacare and, for most of that time, they have refused to acknowledge what that would mean for the millions who would lose their health insurance.On Saturday afternoon in Iowa, for at least a few minutes, one Republican couldn't get away with it.It happened at a Ted Cruz campaign event in Hubbard, a small town smack in the middle of the state. According to reports in The New York Times, The Washington Post and Politico, Cruz fielded a question from Mike Valde, a Democratic voter who had come to the event with a story to tell and a simple question to ask.The story was about his brother-in-law, a barber named Mark. As Valde told it, Mark was a small business owner who worked so hard that he didn’t even take paid days off. But Mark was unable to afford health insurance until the Affordable Care Act became law. When it did, Mark bought insurance and then, when he started feeling ill, saw a physician -- who promptly diagnosed him with cancer with no hope for recovery. He died last year.“He had never been to a doctor for years,” Valde said, reportedly on the verge of tears. “Multiple tumors behind his heart, his liver, his pancreas. And they said, ‘We’re sorry, sir, there’s nothing we can do for you.’""The room fell silent, according to the Times' account, and then Valde, who later told reporters that he was a Hillary Clinton supporter, posed his question: “Mark never had health care until Obamacare. What are you going to replace it with?”Cruz offered Valde his condolences before launching into the same basic argument that Republicans always make. “Under Obamacare,” Cruz said, “millions of Americans have lost their jobs. Millions of Americans have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.” He pointed out that Obama had promised families would see average savings of $2500 from health care reform, and joked that he’d gladly encourage anybody who'd actually reaped such savings to vote for Clinton -- a quip that drew laughter from the audience.Valde, apparently less amused, kept at it. “My question is, what are you going to replace it with?” he said. Cruz responded that he’d get there, but first he wanted to talk some more about the “millions of stories on the other side” -- people who'd had to give up their old plans and, as a result, ended up with higher premiums or co-pays, narrow networks of providers or some combination thereof.Eventually Cruz suggested that if Valde’s brother-in-law couldn’t afford health insurance premiums previously, it was probably because government regulation had driven up the price -- and that the best solution, at this point, was to wipe the slate clean and build a new health care system, one in which people could purchase coverage across state lines.It mirrored the answer Cruz had given just two days before, when Fox News host Bret Baier posed a similar question during Thursday's presidential debate in Des Moines. And Cruz's description of Obamacare’s effects hadn’t gotten any less misleading in the interim. It’s true that President Barack Obama's signature health care law rewrote the rules for how insurance companies sell policies directly to individuals -- requiring that all policies include comprehensive benefits, for example, and prohibiting carriers from charging higher premiums or denying coverage outright to people who pose greater medical risks. And it’s true that, because of those changes, insurers cancelled some existing policies. But early reports suggesting as many 5 million people lost their old policies appear to have been exaggerated. Subsequent studies estimated that the actual number was less than half of that.Meanwhile, those people were able to get new coverage through the law’s marketplaces. And the best available research suggests that the majority ended up paying less money, not more, for their policies, while enjoying guarantees of coverage nobody had previously. Overall, fewer and fewer Americans are reporting difficulty with medical bills and the proportion of Americans without coverage has fallen to historic lows. In Iowa specifically, the proportion of residents without health insurance fell by nearly half from 2013 to 2015, according to Gallup.As for the claim that the Affordable Care Act has either destroyed jobs or turned millions of full-time positions into part-time ones, it appears to be just plain wrong. Anecdotal stories of employers capping hours got a lot of attention in 2014 and 2015, but experts have now had time to examine the data and they see no signs of a significant trend towards part-time work. (Also of note: the private sector has created jobs in every month since the Affordable Care Act became law.) Based on conversations with several well-respected economists, the website Politifact recently rated this favorite Republican argument “Pants on Fire.”Allowing people to buy insurance across state lines, as Cruz proposed, is something conservatives have long favored. It would allow insurers to start acting like credit card companies, relocating to whatever states have the least onerous regulations and selling all policies from them.Like other efforts to gut existing rules on how insurers operate, it’d allow the industry to sell cheap, skimpy policies that might appeal to some healthy people, but would offer nothing to people need comprehensive coverage. In short, it’s a way of allowing insurers to act like they did before health care reform -- not a way to make sure millions get insurance.There’s a reason Cruz didn’t have a better answer for Valde, and it’s the same reason Republicans never have a satisfying response to this question.The Affordable Care Act has its pluses and minuses, with plenty of people legitimately aggrieved about what it’s done or how it’s worked out for them -- and plenty more opposed for philosophical reasons. But any alternative that provides similar (or better) access to health care protection from medical bills is bound to require a similar combination of regulation and government spending. Republicans oppose such measures on principle -- which is why, when they talk about Obamacare, they exaggerate the downsides, ignore the upsides, and pretend they have better alternatives.While Cruz never responded to Valde, another candidate did. On Saturday evening, at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Clinton referenced the conversation that had taken place at the Cruz event. She noted that millions would lose their insurance if Cruz and the other Republicans have their way. ""That’s fine with them,"" she said. ""That’s not fine with me."""

10,POLITICS,Martin O'Malley's Saturday Night In Iowa Was Kind Of Depressing,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/martin-omalley-2016-iowa_us_56ae646be4b0010e80ea8380,Even people who came to his campaign event aren't voting for him.,2016-01-31,"Two days before the Iowa caucuses, Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley stood on a chair and made the case for being president.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ae65341f00005000217042.jpeg?ops=crop_359_160_1480_924%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- It's crunch time in Iowa, and presidential candidates are hitting as many high-profile events as they can ahead of Monday night's caucuses. Bernie Sanders spent Saturday night on stage with the popular rock band Vampire Weekend in front of thousands of cheering hipsters. Hillary Clinton brought out her husband, former President Bill Clinton, on another stage in front of hundreds of supporters.Martin O'Malley? He stood on a chair in his cramped campaign office. About 100 or so people came to hear him talk. A table in the back offered a spread of hamburgers, store-bought cookies and something simmering in a crockpot. A printed ""Wish List"" taped to the wall asked supporters for donated items. A couch. Inflatable mattresses (?). Pens. A vacuum cleaner.The last request on the list was scribbled in by hand: ""A victory in Iowa!""The former Maryland governor isn't where he wanted to be in this race. The final Iowa pre-caucus poll from the Des Moines Register, released Saturday, shows Clinton and Sanders duking it out in the Democratic primary -- Clinton barely leads Sanders, 45 to 42 percent -- and O'Malley way, way below them, at 4 percent. Yet he still got some people to show up to this event tucked away in what looks like a warehouse. Why did they come?""I'm a huge fan of O'Malley,"" said Elizabeth Mitchell, who drove to Des Moines with her husband, Gene. But they live in Chicago and only came to Iowa to check out the scene. And they're not voting for O'Malley anyway. They're for Clinton.""I've supported her since 2008,"" said Elizabeth. ""If it were basically anybody other than her that was running against O'Malley, I'd be supporting him.""""Yeah, O'Malley is our second choice,"" Gene said. ""Hillary is first.""Some people at O'Malley's event were actual supporters. Eric Hill, a veteran who lives in Des Moines, said he likes him because he's ""articulate and middle-of-the-road."" He also conveyed a palpable disdain for Clinton.""She just seems like the consummate politician. Over the years, I've seen her do so many things that she's gotten in controversy over. I just, I can't trust her,"" Eric said. ""I don't think she's anywhere near as good as she pretends she's going to be.""He said his second choice for president would be Sanders and that he might even vote for a Republican before he would support Clinton. Not Trump, who is ""really a clown,"" he said, but maybe one of the lower-tier candidates.For O'Malley's backers, it makes a difference who they would pick as a second candidate. The way the caucuses work, a Democratic candidate has to get 15 percent of a caucus vote to be considered viable. O'Malley won't be able to reach that threshold in many locations, which means his supporters will have to pick another candidate. With Clinton and Sanders in such a tight race, O'Malley's backers could tip the scales in either direction.Eric's wife, Sylvia, who had been quietly listening to the conversation, said she's voting for Sanders. It's a divided household at the Hill residence.""If I can't talk her into O'Malley, she might be sleeping on the couch tonight,"" Eric said.Sylvia said she likes O'Malley all right, but Sanders stands out because he ""speaks what's on his mind. Seriously. He's telling you what he believes to be the truth. That's why I like him.""Even more than Eric, Sylvia can't stand Clinton. She says she lost respect for her after Bill Clinton's dalliances with an intern named Monica Lewinsky.""When he did the stuff he did, you know, she did not give him his walking papers. That for me was disgusting,"" said Sylvia. ""All she's doing is riding his coattails, trying to, into the White House. If you notice, she dropped the Rodham name. All she uses is Hillary Clinton.""At this point in the night, O'Malley climbed onto a chair and delivered a 10-minute monologue about his vision for America -- he advocated immigration reform, expanding Social Security, debt-free college, solutions to climate change, job creation -- and urged supporters to ""hold strong"" and spread the word about his campaign. When he was done, people clapped for a long time and murmured about how inspiring O'Malley is.""Excellent speech,"" said Adam Schwartz, who lives in Florida but came to Des Moines to help O'Malley's campaign.""He really sets forth a great progressive agenda,"" said Schwartz. ""He brings youth and energy and is not more of the same. Hillary Clinton, I respect her, but she's yesterday's news.""He said Clinton would still be his second choice for president, though, because he doesn't think Sanders has the electability.""Are Americans ready to elect a self-proclaimed Sscialist? I don't know,"" said Schwartz. ""Are we paving our way to a Donald Trump presidency? That's what scares me.""That seemed to be a widespread sentiment. Rachel Wilkie-Shapiro, a mother of two who lives in Des Moines, said while Sanders ""says a lot of great, wonderful things,"" she doesn't know if he's equipped to beat the Republican nominee.""I want a Democrat in the Oval Office,"" she said. ""I think Hillary is better suited to fight whoever she's against.""Wilkie-Shapiro is still holding out for O'Malley, though. She said she's drawn to him because he ""has enough specificity and action, but also has a bold, positive vision for where we're going and I really appreciate that.""As the night rolled on, Ben Zakarij stood alone at the back. HuffPost was drawn to him because of his scruffy beard with two long braids dangling out of it. He said his wife does that for him.""We endorsed O'Malley unanimously three months ago,"" said Zakarij, who is a board member of STARPAC, a Des Moines-based group focused on war and peace issues. ""As the governor of Maryland, he passed the Marriage Equality Act. The Dream Act. He rescinded the death penalty... They're separate issues from each other, but it requires a specific coalition to come together to get those things passed. For me, what's behind a coalition is inclusion.""He said his second choice for president would be Sanders. ""It goes back to war and peace issues,"" he said.It will all come down to turnout on Monday night, and Zakarij, for one, can't wait to get out there and make the case for O'Malley. He's been involved in caucuses since 1982 and described the Iowa process as the most democratic exercise in modern times.""For me, it harkens back to ancient Greece. Athens. Small groups of people getting together, electing a spokesperson to take it to the larger council,"" Zakarij said. ""The only difference is if that person violated my issues, I could kill him. You can't do that anymore.""Also on HuffPost:"

Street views will virtually transport users to culturally significant locations across the country like the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, and the Museum of African American History in New England.Meanwhile, new digital artifacts include historically relevant items like the original manuscripts of Dr. Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" and ""I've Been to the Mountaintop” speeches, as well as photographs of King's handshake with President Lyndon B. Johnson on the day the Voting Rights Act was signed into law in 1965. Historical institutes like the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture contributed to the collection by digitizing portions of their archives. One exhibit pays tribute to masterminds like Alvin Ailey and Martha Graham, who played an important role in the journey of black dancers and helped to highlight their work in contemporary dance. Also among the artifacts is a letter Frederick Douglass wrote to his slave master in 1857. ""I love you but I hate slavery,"" Douglass wrote, going on to explain why he felt the need to stay in touch with his former master even after he escaped. These new additions document critical moments of black history in interactive and innovative methods.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has been attacking the business mogul for supporting government-run health insurance, comparing it to Obamacare. Trump said Cruz was a ""total liar"" and that he strongly opposes Obamacare. As for his own health care plan, Trump has offered broad statements but few details -- similar to his promises to deport all undocumented immigrants through ""management."" Stephanopoulos challenged him on how his plan would differ from Obamacare, if both are aimed at making sure everyone is insured and would involve government help. Trump said it was true -- ""I want people taken care of,"" he said, adding that maybe Cruz has ""no heart."" But Trump said he does not want a single-payer system. So, Stephanopoulos asked, how would it work? ""We're going to work with our hospitals,"" Trump replied. ""We're going to work with our doctors. We've got to do something. ... We'll work something out. That doesn't mean single-payer."" Trump is leading in Iowa among Republicans with only a day to go before the caucuses, according to a Bloomberg/Des Moines Register/Selzer poll released late Saturday. Twenty-eight percent of those polled said Trump was their first choice, compared to 23 percent who plan to support Cruz.

And it is his uncharacteristic bluster that made her bolt the Democrats in favor of the Grand Old Party.“He’s down to earth and seems to have a lot of common sense, which is lacking. I just like him. I think he really stirred the people up,” said Thoeni, who huddled with approximately 800 other people at an outdoor Trump rally on Saturday, a chilly winter day in January. The venue was none other than a hangar at the Dubuque airport, the classiest of locations, if only because it provided the best view of Trump’s arrival in a Boeing 757 jet emblazoned with his name.“I like how he wants to take back our country. That’s the main thing; it’s our country. And the respect. We’re getting screwed over,” she added.Thoeni works at an electronics manufacturing firm in Dubuque, a city of approximately 60,000 people located along the Mississippi River, at the junction of Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin. She says the city is suffering from a stagnant economy, and is disappointed with Democrats for failing to adequately turn things around. When Trump, a wealthy businessman who espouses protectionist economic policies, rails against nations like Mexico and China, Thoeni says she can relate.“People at the company I work for, they lost their jobs. They’re sending those jobs to China,” she said.Thoeni is one of many working-class whites who make up a large portion of the Trump phenomenon currently sweeping across the country. It is a coalition that spans Southern states and the Rust Belt, which has suffered from economic decline, population loss and urban decay. It also includes a good chunk of less educated Americans who do not have a college degree, and who feel like they’ve been ignored by leaders in Washington.Trump believes he can win over such voters, many of whom are registered Democrat but lean independent. Last fall, he predicted that his campaign would “go across lines.”“I think I’ll have a lot of Democrat[s]. You know, [Ronald] Reagan had Democrats for Reagan, it was a very big group of people and a very big bloc,” he said in a September interview.For Thoeni, who is planning on changing her registration, Democrats have put forth no other candidate that she finds appealing. Although she caucused for Hillary Clinton in 2008, she said that she finds the many controversies of her campaign unsettling.“I voted for Hillary, but I do not want her in this. I was all for women's power, but she just got herself involved in too many things. She lies; it doesn’t look good. Her emails --” she said, before suddenly being interrupted by Trump’s descending plane as it flew low across the sky above the crowd.“That’s Trump, that’s Trump right there!” she pointed excitedly, laughing along with a friend she brought to the event in hopes of persuading her to vote for the mogul. And Bernie Sanders?“Just too old,” she said of the Vermont senator, who is 74.As Trump’s plane taxied on the runway, Thoeni remarked that she admired Trump’s energy and youthful appearance.“He seems like such a young man. He seems my age,"" she said of the 69-year-old businessman. ""He’s got a full head of hair.""Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

Trump received the honor in 2007 for producing and hosting the NBC reality TV show.""I've never seen this kind of hate put on a star before, not even Bill Cosby,"" Austin Franklin told the website.Since announcing his campaign run, Trump has repeatedly made headlines for his xenophobic stances, including his call to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. and his declaration that Latino immigrants are ""criminals"" and ""rapists.""He has been likened to the Nazi party's leader, Adolf Hitler, whose own ideals of racial purity led to the slaughter of an estimated 11 million people during World War II.In December, an image of Trump’s face was seen slapped over a Swastika sign beneath a highway overpass in Atlanta. The caricature was complete with a Hitler-style mustache and a bow tie made out of a U.S. $100 bill.Last week, Anne Frank's stepsister, 86-year-old Eva Schloss, also compared Trump to Hitler in a column published by Newsweek.""I think [Trump] is acting like another Hitler by inciting racism,"" wrote Schloss, who survived the Auschwitz concentration camp.""During his U.S. presidential campaign he has suggested the 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,' as well as pledging to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico to keep illegal immigrants out.""Reddit users were quick to point out that the person defacing Trump's star may have actually wished him good luck or fortune because of the swastika's counterclockwise direction, which differs from the one taken by Hitler.In the thousands of years before the symbol was appropriated by the Nazi party it represented good luck, fortune and success.Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

Then, when Hudgens accepted the award for Breakthrough Performer at the 2015 Industry Dance Awards & Cancer Benefit Show, she opened up about her father's struggle with cancer.“Last year, my boyfriend, Austin [Butler], lost his mom, Lori, to cancer, and my dad has just been recently diagnosed with stage four cancer,” she said in her August speech. “Let me tell you, I hate cancer. I hate cancer with every cell of my being.… This award, it means a lot to me, but I dedicate it to my boyfriend’s mom, Lori, my dad, and to all the families out there who are struggling with this, because it really takes a strong person and a strong family to be able to help those out who are going through this.”Our thoughts are with the Hudgens family tonight.

Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign raised $33.6 million in the last three months of 2015 and another $20 million in January alone, the campaign announced Sunday. The campaign further stated that 1.3 million people have made 3.25 million donations to Sanders' run -- a record number of donors at this stage in a presidential campaign.“The numbers we’ve seen since Jan. 1 put our campaign on pace to beat Secretary Clinton’s goal of $50 million in the first quarter of 2016,” Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, said in a statement. “Working Americans chipping in a few dollars each month are not only challenging but beating the greatest fundraising machine ever assembled.”The vast majority of Sanders' money has come from donors giving under $200. This contrasts with Hillary Clinton's campaign, which has raised the majority of its funds from donors giving maximum contributions of $2,700. Clinton’s campaign has also raised substantial sums from small donors, but Sanders’ ability to remain competitive with Clinton’s fundraising by relying solely on small contributions is unprecedented.The Sanders camp said that the fourth quarter total will show 70 percent of the campaign's donations came from small donors. Further, the $20 million it reports to have raised in January came almost exclusively from online donations averaging $27 a piece.Overall, Sanders raised $75 million in 2015 compared to an anticipated $114 million for Clinton.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said 3.25 million people donated to Sanders' campaign. In fact, 1.3 million donors made 3.25 million donations."

By the beginning of the following year, aided by the deployment of aircraft such as the Fokker D I, D II and D III and the Albatros D I, the Germans had once again achieved air superiority over the Western Front. In the meantime, although the United States was not yet in the war, many American volunteers were flying in Allied air squadrons. In March of that year, the French organized Squadron Number 123, called the Escadrille Américaine. The word Escadrille simply meant squadron. The Germans filed an official objection with the U.S. government over the name; claiming it suggested American support for the French war effort and was a violation of America's stated neutrality. In response to a request from Washington, in December the squadron was renamed the Lafayette Escadrille in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette--a hero of both the American and French revolutions. The squadron had been the idea of Dr. Edmund L. Gros, medical director of the American Field Service (AFS), and Norman Prince. The AFS, which today conducts intercultural exchange programs around the world for young people, began as a volunteer ambulance service during World War I staffed mostly by expatriate Americans living in France. Prince and Price hoped that the exploits of an American air unit fighting on behalf of the Allies would spur public support of the Allied cause in the United States and lead to a formal entry of the U.S. into World War I. The Escadrille Américaine, escadrille N. 124, was authorized by the French Air Department on March 21, 1916. It was deployed on April 20 in Luxruil-les-Bains, a small town in Burgundy in eastern France. By May, the squadron had been trained to combat level and it was soon in action over Verdun. On May 18, 1916, while over the Verdun battlefield, Kiffin Rockwell recorded the squadron's first aerial kill. The squadron consisted of 28 American pilots, including Eugene Bullard, the first African-American fighter pilot. The escadrille's commander, Captain Georges Thenault, was French and so were the unit's mechanics, airplanes and ground support. There were an additional five French pilots that flew, at various times, with the squadron. Its members all wore French uniforms. The number of volunteer American pilots exceeded the capacity of the Lafayette Escadrille, so the French organized the Lafayette Flying Corp. In total, 265 Americans served in the Corp, including the members of the Lafayette Escadrille. There were a total of 209 American pilots that completed French flight training. Of these, 180 saw combat in the French Air Force. Whisky and Soda, the lion mascots of the Lafayette EscadrilleThe members of the squadron, with their mixture of gaudy uniforms and their lion cub mascots named Whiskey and Soda, caught the public's imagination. The pilots were able to live and play behind the squalor of the trenches. Their frequent trips to the hot spots of Paris were tempered by the knowledge that the average life expectancy of a World War I fighter pilot was just over three weeks.One pilot who beat the average before finally succumbing was Major Raoul Lufberry, an American citizen born in France. He was the Lafayette Escadrille's first and only ace and America's third highest scoring ace with 17 ""kills."" He served in both the French and U.S. air services. Lufberry was killed on May 19, 1918 when, during combat, he fell from his blazing Nieuport 28. Following the entry of the United States into the war, the squadron was dispersed on February 8, 1918. The pilots were subsequently inducted into the U.S. Air Service. Most of the veteran pilots were assigned to training the newly arrived American airmen. Twelve of the pilots were inducted into the 103rd Aero Squadron. The name of the Lafayette Escadrille was subsequently changed to the Jeanne d'Arc (Joan of Arc) Escadrille and continued its participation in the war. The Escadrille SPA-124, the Jeanne d'Arc Escadrille, is still an operating squadron of the modern French Air Force. The emergence of air power as a theater of conflict in World War I represented an unprecedented expansion of the battlefield into a third dimension. Not only was the conflict a world war that encompassed 90 percent of its inhabitants, but it was also a conflict that was fought out everywhere, on land and sea, beneath the waves and in the air. Air power represented the cutting edge of industrial and technological innovation in the early twentieth century, and evolved rapidly following the first successful air flight of the Wright brothers. On the other hand, however intriguing and fascinating, it is hard to see how air power in itself was that crucial a factor in shaping the outcome of the war. Unlike the submarine or the tank, both also important technological innovations that emerged from the war and whose impact on the outcome of the war is far more apparent, we cannot point to any battles whose outcome was shaped by the role of air power.  Major Raoul Lufberry in his Nieuport 17Those daring young men and their flying machines may have captured the public's imagination, and they may have been a useful tool for reconnaissance and the ground support of troops, but in the end their impact in shaping both the conduct and the outcome of the war was muted.Instead it would be fair to say that World War I was the crucible in which the weapon of air power was tested and refined. Many of the roles that would eventually be assumed by air power: air superiority, close ground support, strategic bombing and marine reconnaissance, first emerged during this war. So too did naval air power and the first aircraft carriers, and the role of air power in shaping war at sea. It would take another generation and another world war before the true power of this weapon would be unleashed and when it was, it would prove to be devastating.By the end of the war, American Brigadier-General Billy Mitchell was able to declare with confidence, ""The day has passed when armies on the ground or navies on the sea can be the arbiter of a nation's destiny in war. The main power of the defense and the power of initiative against an enemy has passed to the air."""

Most careful observers of politics (present authors included) believed Trump would have washed out quickly and decisively. His seemingly off-the-cuff banter and Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog, vitriol sprayed - rather than carefully targeted -- at political opponents, fellow partisans, and journalists portended a half-life as a presidential candidate that might rival Herman Cain's 2012 presidential run. Yet, time and again, Trump has turned what would have been fatal gaffes if uttered by any other candidate into rally points for voters tired of political correctness and ready for a candidate to speak abrasively if not truthfully. Perhaps even more surprisingly, in a party that regularly casts out more conservative candidates as RINOS (Republicans in Name Only), the ideologically ambidextrous and trans-partisan Trump has not only endured but has emerged as the GOP frontrunner. Forget that from 2001 to 2009 he was a registered Democrat and that as recently as 2011 he was registered as an independent. Forget too that his mishmash of policy positions makes him more populist than conservative, he is now positioned such that winning the Republican nomination seems more real than laughable. This is too is an odd turn of events. In an election where public anger at the financial and partisan establishment serves as the campaign's driving narrative; the well-established Trump, a generous contributor to Democrats and Republicans alike and recipient of profitable political favors that drove much of his business success, has crafted himself an outsider. Amidst lingering outrage at the financial manipulations that dragged the economy into the Great Recession, the bankrupt Trump admitted to using bankruptcy laws to avoid losing money in bad deals he negotiated. Four times from 1991 to 2009, Trump hotels and casinos were too big to fail. Yet, the billionaire gambler and builder of bankrupt casinos has emerged as the voice of marginalized working class whites. Even Donald Trump appears surprised at the depth and breadth of his support. ""I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody,"" he declared, ""and not lose any voters."" Despite our bafflement, there are lessons to be learned in Trump's success. Perhaps surprisingly, many of them confirm rather than challenge what we know about campaigns and elections. 1. We live in a polarized political era with the parties more clearly and consistently defined by ideology than at any time in the recent past. Yet, ideology matters more as a symbolic attachment than as a well-defined and consistent set of issue positions, and ideological positioning shifts in accordance with the positions staked out by political elites. By current definitions, Donald Trump is a poor reflection of a conservative Republican. But if he wins, he will redefine the terms, and conservatism will look more like Donald Trump than Ronald Reagan. 2. Even in an age where the political parties are more clearly defined by ideology, parties are comprised of factions of voters united under a common label. The modern Republican Party has long welcomed racially resentful but economically populist white voters. These voters served as a key voting bloc for Richard Nixon's southern strategy and comprised much of what were termed ""Reagan Democrats."" Twelve years ago, Thomas Frank pondered ""What is the Matter with Kansas,"" questioning why working class voters whose economic interests resided with the Democratic Party were persuaded to support Republican candidates and causes. Trump's 2016 campaign elevates populist angst above the twin pillars of religious and economic conservatism, thus threatening the mainstream Republican base built on a small government philosophy, economic conservatism, and evangelical voters. In this respect, Trump's campaign is not dissimilar from Pat Buchanan's insurgent campaign in 1992 or Rick Santorum's 2012 campaign, but he benefits from a divided Republican Party and thus stands a much better chance of winning the nomination and rattling the balance of power within the GOP.  3. Campaigns are not just contests where candidates compete over the best set of issue stances, they are emotionally driven where candidates connect with subsets of voters. In 1992, Bill Clinton famously ""felt the pain"" of voters concerned about their economic future. His emotional connectedness during a time of economic uncertainty was more critical to his success than any set of policies he endorsed. Barack Obama similarly fueled his 2008 campaign with the positive emotion of hope, promising a stronger economy and better future. No emotion is better at mobilizing voters than anger, and Trump's insulting low-brow campaign fuels - and is fueled off of - voter anger and resentment. Partisan polarization, driven as much by a deep dislike of the other side, gives these appeals greater resonance. In a 2014 study, the Pew Center for the People and the Press discovered Republicans and Democrats alike were increasingly willing to say the other party was ""a threat to the nation's future."" Trump's bluster plays well in this context. What is perhaps remarkable about the emotional tenor of the Trump campaign isn't that it is using anger as a central emotional appeal, but rather that it has no other emotional gear. 4. Most political campaigns work incredibly hard to get ""earned media,"" coverage by news networks that is ""free"" and subsequently has greater credibility than paid advertisements. Donald Trump has received more free media coverage than all of his Republican opponents combined. Indeed, during the early stage of his campaign, he received so much coverage that he spent little or no money actually campaigning.He has done so by playing to well-known media biases; i.e., controversy and conflict make for great news. Trump rarely says a non-controversial word. On any given Sunday morning, it is not unusual to hear Trump calling into multiple news programs while the news networks have provided nearly wall-to-wall coverage. When other candidates do a get a chance to appear, it is often to respond to an incendiary comment made by Trump. The effect is two-fold. Trump benefits from the coverage directly and drowns out the other candidates who might have otherwise received air time. A lesser candidate might have used controversy to generate coverage, but would have failed to generate greater political support. In this respect, news coverage is a fickle friend, sometimes it helps but often it hurts political campaigns. Trump has masterfully turned this coverage mostly in his favor building support among Republican voters. 5. The strategic decisions of other candidates matter. The other Republicans in this race (like most pundits) underestimated Trump's potential appeal. His campaign seemed at best a curious sideshow that would eventually self-destruct. The best thing to do, these candidates reasoned, was to get out of the way until the circus was over and the real campaign could begin. Ted Cruz, in particular, played nice for as long as possible hoping for a political payoff in Trump voters once the Trump campaign ended. The result was that candidates mostly held their fire, preferring instead to target seemingly more serious and threatening opponents. Trump helped this process by threatening an independent campaign if treated unfairly that would likely guarantee a Democratic presidency. These decisions allowed Trump to avoid the sort of sustained negative campaign that might have undermined his political support. They also allowed him the time to grow into a stronger and more viable political candidate. All of this said, Donald Trump still has significant barriers to overcome and his campaign, more successful than most of us would have predicted, may well prove his undoing. First, he is the least favorably viewed of all the presidential candidates, and his ratings among independents and Democrats are particularly low. Using controversy to generate news coverage has generated support but also has deepened animosities. Second, he is pushing the Republican Party into issue positions that will make it more difficult for Republicans to win elections among an increasingly diverse electorate. Working class white voters are an important voting bloc, but as we have noted in previous posts (link) they are a shrinking share of the electorate. Overall, the Trump campaign has challenged our thinking about the nature of political campaigns but mainly by highlighting and recasting lessons we have already learned. The most important of these may be that campaigns are about emotional attachments rather than set ideological views, even in an increasingly conservative Republican Party. If Donald Trump wins the nomination, he will have succeeded in redefining what it means to be a conservative and a Republican, and he will have done so by tapping into anger at the Republican establishment."

Most careful observers of politics (present authors included) believed Trump would have washed out quickly and decisively. His seemingly off-the-cuff banter and Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog, vitriol sprayed - rather than carefully targeted -- at political opponents, fellow partisans, and journalists portended a half-life as a presidential candidate that might rival Herman Cain's 2012 presidential run. Yet, time and again, Trump has turned what would have been fatal gaffes if uttered by any other candidate into rally points for voters tired of political correctness and ready for a candidate to speak abrasively if not truthfully. Perhaps even more surprisingly, in a party that regularly casts out more conservative candidates as RINOS (Republicans in Name Only), the ideologically ambidextrous and trans-partisan Trump has not only endured but has emerged as the GOP frontrunner. Forget that from 2001 to 2009 he was a registered Democrat and that as recently as 2011 he was registered as an independent. Forget too that his mishmash of policy positions makes him more populist than conservative, he is now positioned such that winning the Republican nomination seems more real than laughable. This is too is an odd turn of events.

Many students are deterred from opting for a homestay when weighing their study abroad choices, simply because they don't want to live with strangers. However staying with a local family, living and breathing the culture and being a participant in your new country will make your experience so much more beneficial in all aspects of your trip.You will soon realize that these strangers are warm, welcoming, and caring people who want to help you have an incredible time abroad, share their culture with you, and create a well-rounded environment for you to dive into your experience. You can try to compare pros and cons, but you will find that the list of positive aspects of a homestay is far longer than you imagined-and here are just a few examples.Language PracticeLearning a second language in the classroom is nothing compared to the immersion you will receive when living with a host family. You may have already mastered the grammar basics and some useful vocabulary in your language of choice, but did you learned the regional slang? Have you engaged in conversation over dinner about life, politics, and culture in your new country? Can you name all the different ways that a parent may call you son or daughter?Language learning is done best when the ear is constantly being attuned to a new dialect, and the tongue is practicing new foreign words, rolling consonants, and elongating vowels. If your goal is to improve your skills, live your life in the language you are learning, and spend time with people who are native speakers.Lessons in CultureBecoming a part of a new family means adopting their customs, and it gives you the right to ask questions about why that culture behaves in a certain way and how traditions came to be. From throwing little siblings' birthday parties to dancing at cousins' weddings, and from trips to visit grandparents outside the city to attending religious services on holidays, you are in a position to view the everyday life of a culture not only from a front row seat but as a participant.You have the opportunity to dive deeply into the culture. Ask your host mother to teach you to make a traditional food or craft, and show her something from your country. You can make an effort not only to learn about culture, but to exchange it.Authentic (and free) FoodThere is nothing like home-cooked spaghetti sauce made by your Italian host mother in Florence, or a fresh-off-the-grill cut of beef tended to by your host father in Buenos Aires. Food is a lens into history and tradition, and it is one of the many aspects that make a place unique. Living with a host family gives you the opportunity to sample the most authentic versions of dishes you may have tried before -- but this recipe is one that's been handed down for generations.Not only do you get to enjoy fresh homemade meals, but more often than not they are included in the fee of your program, cutting down on your everyday expenses, reducing your restaurant trips, and keeping you full and satisfied.Cost EffectivenessEspecially for study programs in big cities, the choice to stay with a host family is usually the most economic one. Apartment options will be pricey and won't include meals, but in a homestay you will eat well, sleep soundly, and you might even get lucky with a family maid to clean your room and do your laundry -- or your wonderful host mother will be up to the task.Imagine the regret that apartment-living students will feel when they learn that your host family took you on a weekend excursion to show you more of the countryside! Host families do an incredible service: they reduce the financial stress of a study abroad trip and expose you to your new country, all while taking care of you and making sure that your stay in their home is a fantastic one.A Support SystemWhile study abroad can be the experience of a lifetime, there is no doubt that there is an element of loneliness that comes with it. You are on your own in a place completely foreign to you, and on top of dealing with culture shock you have to try to make friends with other people in your program. Some people may excel at this, but for others it is a daunting task and comfort can be found in the stability and safety of a homestay.Coming home to open arms and double-cheek-kisses from your Ecuadorian host mother is the ultimate relief after a day of language frustration, schoolwork overload, and homesickness. Your host family is also connected to your academic program, and they will be able to communicate with them if you are having problems in your new country, need to visit a doctor, or just generally need some extra help. They are there for you.Photo Credit: Hannah PursleyThat Motherly PushAs if you aren't already completely out of your element, your host family may push you to examine the limits of your comfort zone and encourage you to get out of the house and experience your new country. If you spend too much time video chatting friends back home, your host mother will call you out on it and push you to make local friends. If you don't go out at night, she will tell you that you aren't having enough fun. She's not your typical mother -- she will encourage your independence and find joy in your new discoveries.Involve her in your life abroad. Help her cook, show her pictures from your weekend excursions, and introduce her to those new friends she told you to make. You just may find that staying with this foreign family was the best thing that ever happened to you.Always Have a Place to Return ToAt the end of your experience abroad the goodbyes will be hard, but they definitely don't have to be forever. Every student who stays with a host family makes the promise to return to the country and visit them one day -- be the exception who turns that into a reality.Your host family's support will extend beyond the contracts of your study abroad program, and they will delight in receiving updates from you on social media or through the occasional letter or holiday card. Remember that they were an incredible part of your experience, and when you are making travel plans in the future, keep in mind that you will always have a free and loving place to stay on the other side of the world."

The brothers have become a focus of Democrats and liberals as they are accused of skewing the political playing field with their finances.

With strings attached. Six media outlets gained access this year under the condition of not disclosing donor identities, while the Kochs enlisted hotel security staff and police officers to intimidate this reporter from exercising her First Amendment rights. As Koch grand strategist Richard Fink sat in the Glo Lounge of the posh Renaissance Esmeralda Indian Wells resort in Palm Springs on Thursday, I heard his communications staff report to him that Fredreka Schouten of USA Today was ""prepped."" Sure enough, just hours later, at 5 AM on Jan. 29, her piece went live on the USA Today site: ""Koch brothers' new group will take on poverty, education.""That piece dutifully relayed Koch talking points about the $15 million the group, ""Stand Together,"" is trying ""to raise."" The exclusive ""first interview"" about this new operation was just the kind of uncritical ""earned media"" the Koch team wanted by launching the group's website just as the Kochs gather with their billionaire buddies to discuss spending another nearly half a billion dollars in the 2016 election.Schouten even adopted Koch rhetoric that the billionaires' money-raising effort to achieve their political ambitions was a ""seminar."" The story accepted all manner of Koch assertions and gloss as true and without acknowledging key facts to the contrary in many instances.For example, it noted that the Kochs have been pushing for criminal justice reform, without noting that a key component of their agenda is to make it harder to prosecute corporate crimes, as Koch Industries and some of its employees had been charged with breaking environmental laws in the 1990s. Their general counsel, Mark Holden, admitted their interest in this reform stemmed from that prosecution over leaking tons of cancer-causing benzene. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on that part of the Koch agenda just two weeks ago in which some Members expressed deep concerns about the effort to use the need to address the disproportionate mass incarceration of African Americans as a vehicle to let white-collar criminals off the hook.It also favorably mentioned the Kochs' recent funding of the United Negro College Fund, without noting the strings the Kochs put on the scholarships and the role of Koch Industries in determining who is sufficiently supportive of their ideology to get the money.  It noted that the Kochs' Libre Initiative, which basically markets Koch kool-aid to Latinos, gave out holiday turkeys to some families--without noting how the group has come under wide criticism for peddling policies that hurt many Latino families like opposing increasing the minimum wage, opposing access to affordable health care, and undermining workers' rights. It also portrayed concerns about the Kochs' secretive but enormous role in elections as partisan--saying they ""face deep skepticism from Democrats""--even though polling consistently shows that Americans from both major political parties and independents are deeply concerned about the influence of special interests on our elections and super-majorities oppose the Citizens United decision that has helped unleash the Koch election machine.It also uncritically quoted Bob Woodson, a black conservative who was an architect of George W. Bush's faith-based initiative, and who is working with the new group. He claimed the Koch brothers and the right-wing CEOs and trust-fund babies they gather are just ""grass-roots rich people"" and ""not the kind of corporate elitists who boast all the time about their vacations in France."" And it comes from a guy who claims the Kochs' ""philosophy and operating principles [are] ... 100% compatible with the way we help the poor."" That's some nice spin.Meanwhile, the Koch family fortune is the biggest funder of the American Legislative Exchange Council and for more than twenty years Koch Industries has been a leader of ALEC, as it pushed bills to make it harder for Americans to vote (legislation that disproportionately affects impoverished Americans who rely on public transit), to repeal the minimum wage and stop any increase to it, to pre-empt local rent control laws, to oppose limits on ATM fees and interest charges on credit cards and payday loans, to impose a panoply of restrictions on food stamps and welfare aid, to privatize Medicaid in favor of Health Savings Accounts that cannot possibly cover costs for serious accidents or illnesses, and many more bills that hurt the poor.The story also noted that David Koch's Americans for Prosperity group has been giving poor folks lessons on coupon cutting, without noting AFP's role in pushing other policies like ALEC bills that hurt poor Americans.  USA Today also put the story in its weekend edition, as the top story above the fold with a new, even more positive headline: ""Kochs' new group aims to 'revitalize' society."" This messaging is consistent with Richard Fink's stated goal to rebrand their free-market ideology as a ""movement for well-being."" For Fink, the man called ""Charles Koch's brain,"" the prepping of USA Today by his team certainly paid dividends in positive press for the Koch operation.While selecting a handful of reporters to come to their gathering on the condition that they not tell the American people which billionaires are there funding the Kochs' unprecedented amount of spending in the 2016 election cycle, Charles Koch claimed that they are not ""some secret cabal."" This the day after the Kochs deployed hotel security and local police officers to pressure this reporter to stop taking photos of the incoming conference attendees from a public sidewalk, despite my First Amendment right to do so. I asserted that right and asked for a clarification of the property line, so that I could comply with the full letter of the law.  After falsely claiming the sidewalk was private property and sending local police to intervene, the security team was forced to allow me to stand right next to the guest checkpoint and continue to photograph attendees. Soon thereafter, staffers moved the checkpoint 50 yards or so further into the property, where it is harder for a camera to see into stopped cars. (Video of this below.) Meanwhile, inside the luxury resort, on that very same day the Kochs held a panel on the First Amendment featuring legal commentator Jeff Rosen, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, and a staff writer for the conservative National Review, David French.Apparently the constitutional rights of the Kochs and their secretive billionaire cabal are the only ones that matter.Disclosure: Lauren Windsor is also the executive director of American Family Voices, a non-profit organization that works on middle class economic issues, with a particular focus on Wall Street reform, money-in-politics, and climate change."

That's some nice spin.Meanwhile, the Koch family fortune is the biggest funder of the American Legislative Exchange Council and for more than twenty years Koch Industries has been a leader of ALEC, as it pushed bills to make it harder for Americans to vote (legislation that disproportionately affects impoverished Americans who rely on public transit), to repeal the minimum wage and stop any increase to it, to pre-empt local rent control laws, to oppose limits on ATM fees and interest charges on credit cards and payday loans, to impose a panoply of restrictions on food stamps and welfare aid, to privatize Medicaid in favor of Health Savings Accounts that cannot possibly cover costs for serious accidents or illnesses, and many more bills that hurt the poor.The story also noted that David Koch's Americans for Prosperity group has been giving poor folks lessons on coupon cutting, without noting AFP's role in pushing other policies like ALEC bills that hurt poor Americans.  USA Today also put the story in its weekend edition, as the top story above the fold with a new, even more positive headline: ""Kochs' new group aims to 'revitalize' society."" This messaging is consistent with Richard Fink's stated goal to rebrand their free-market ideology as a ""movement for well-being."" For Fink, the man called ""Charles Koch's brain,"" the prepping of USA Today by his team certainly paid dividends in positive press for the Koch operation.While selecting a handful of reporters to come to their gathering on the condition that they not tell the American people which billionaires are there funding the Kochs' unprecedented amount of spending in the 2016 election cycle, Charles Koch claimed that they are not ""some secret cabal."" This the day after the Kochs deployed hotel security and local police officers to pressure this reporter to stop taking photos of the incoming conference attendees from a public sidewalk, despite my First Amendment right to do so. I asserted that right and asked for a clarification of the property line, so that I could comply with the full letter of the law.  After falsely claiming the sidewalk was private property and sending local police to intervene, the security team was forced to allow me to stand right next to the guest checkpoint and continue to photograph attendees. Soon thereafter, staffers moved the checkpoint 50 yards or so further into the property, where it is harder for a camera to see into stopped cars. (Video of this below.) Meanwhile, inside the luxury resort, on that very same day the Kochs held a panel on the First Amendment featuring legal commentator Jeff Rosen, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, and a staff writer for the conservative National Review, David French.Apparently the constitutional rights of the Kochs and their secretive billionaire cabal are the only ones that matter.Disclosure: Lauren Windsor is also the executive director of American Family Voices, a non-profit organization that works on middle class economic issues, with a particular focus on Wall Street reform, money-in-politics, and climate change."
29,POLITICS,The Worst Reason to Not Vote for Bernie Sanders,"Cody Gough, ContributorRadio & Podcast Personality at WGN Radio, Chicago",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-vote-for-bernie-sanders_b_9120740.html,But what does it say about the United States if its citizens are afraid to vote for a candidate because they don't believe their government will allow the leader of the free world to address the biggest domestic problems it faces?,2016-01-31,"Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, speaks during a campaign rally at Five Sullivan Brothers Convention Center in Waterloo, Iowa, U.S., on Sunday, Jan. 31. Hillary Clinton is holding onto a slim lead over Sanders in Iowa as Democrats prepare for Monday's caucuses, though an outpouring of young voters and those who say the system is rigged could enable Sanders to pull off an upset, according to a new poll. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb92fa52000000f0201ec32.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When did citizens of the United States adopt a defeatist attitude?For months now, I have read time after time that if elected president, Bernie Sanders ""won't be able to get anything done,"" and that his policies will ""never be passed"" because of Republican opposition.But what does it say about the United States if its citizens are afraid to vote for a candidate because they don't believe their government will allow the leader of the free world to address the biggest domestic problems it faces? Moreover, what does it say about us?Many Americans grew up hearing about heroic protests. Hundreds of thousands died fighting for their vision of the United States in the Revolutionary War and in the Civil War. The African-American Civil Rights Movement saw boycotts, sit-ins, marches and other forms of protest (including Bernie Sanders' arrest while protesting segregated schools in Chicago). And tens of thousands of citizens demonstrated their opposition to the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s.No idea is more fundamental to Americans' sense of ourselves -- as individuals and as a nation -- than freedom, and we have always been shaped by our battle for it. Millions of Americans have marched, fought and even died for their beliefs and principles.But based on the aforementioned argument against voting for Bernie Sanders, many people believe we shouldn't elect him to be our next president because... his policies might be blocked by other elected officials?... officials elected to represent the best interests of the American people?... at a time when many of Bernie Sanders' proposals are supported by the majority of Americans?Really?Nobody is asking you to pick up a musket and march onto a field and risk being shot and killed among thousands of other Americans. Nobody is asking you to take time off work or quit your job so you can go march in freezing cold weather, or walk to work for 381 days. Nobody is asking you to clash with police officers and risk being shot. Bernie Sanders is simply asking you to register to vote, and then vote. It's not hard to fight for your beliefs in 2016.When did Americans stop standing up for themselves to tremble in fear of a bunch of old people in business suits?Are you truly happy with the state of our country? Because I am not. I am not happy when millions of Americans can't afford medical care. I am not happy when sick people can't afford to buy medication they need to live. I am not happy about contemptible African-American male incarceration rates, or the fact that incomprehensible mandatory minimum sentencing policies are destroying lives. And as someone who would like to start a family some day, I am not happy that America has the worst paid family leave policies of any developed country.Our government could easily pass legislation to alleviate the hardships faced by millions of Americans. To begin that process, all we must do is elect officials with the courage to do so. And as one of those officials, Bernie Sanders has shown consistently for decades that he stands for the fundamental principles of freedom and will stop at nothing to help all Americans attain a higher quality of life.I know a lot of us are comfortable. The internet is great. Television is great. Fast food is great. We have new Star Wars films. What could be better, right?But if you take a close look, you can see a darkness under the light of day-to-day living. And the status quo is not going to change that. Our forefathers did not stand by and say ""legislators will abolish slavery some day"" -- they fought for it. Our parents and grandparents did not sit at home during the Vietnam War while their brothers and sisters were dying and say ""eventually our politicians will get us out of there"" -- they protested. People like Bernie Sanders did not idly watch as his fellow countrymen were mistreated and say ""maybe some day our country will be less segregated""--they stood up for what was right.So do not tell me with a straight face ""I agree with Bernie Sanders' ideas, but I won't vote for him because Hillary Clinton is a more 'realistic' candidate who can slowly enact change."" That is a surrender, and that is not the way of this great country that I've learned about for my entire life.I completely understand that not everyone agrees with Bernie's policies, and I can respect many reasons for voting for another candidate. Do you disagree with Bernie's policies? Fine, then don't vote for him. Do you disagree with his voting record? Fine, then don't vote for him. But don't you dare cast a halfhearted vote for someone else just because you're worried he'll lose a fight, because that's not in the spirit of this country. At all.And on a final note: don't give me the argument that I'm ""naive"" or that I don't understand how politics work. I'm not stupid. I get it. It will be a fight. But I'd rather fight and lose than roll over and accept failure. And I hope that you'll confront your pessimism and mistrust of the system and take a bold step to fight with me.We are the citizens of the United States of America, and this is our country. We are blessed with the privilege of being able to write our own history. And the time to do it is now.This post originally appeared on CodyGough.com"

Ted Cruz speaks at a restaurant in Fenton, Iowa.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56abfbc91a00002d00ab1a3c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FENTON, Iowa -- Three days before the crucial Iowa caucuses, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) still finds himself answering questions over his eligibility to run for president.Real estate mogul Donald Trump, campaigning in New Hampshire on Friday, again attacked Cruz, who is a natural-born U.S. citizen, for being born in Canada. Only this time, Trump upped the ante by calling Cruz an “anchor baby” -- a term many consider derisive, and one that conservatives have used to describe children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants.""Now, Ted Cruz may not be a U.S. citizen. Right? But he's an anchor baby in Canada. No, he's an anchor baby. Ted Cruz is an anchor baby in Canada,"" Trump said in Nashua.Asked multiple times about the charge at a campaign stop on Friday, Cruz did nothing more than simply chuckle. After further inquiries from reporters, he answered the charge by smothering Trump with kindness -- a tactic he has employed frequently on the campaign trail.""I like Donald. He's welcome to say whatever he likes. I like and respect him,” Cruz said before addressing approximately 100 people at a restaurant in Fenton, a small town in northern Iowa.Cruz has been betting on Trump to implode for months, hoping that he can draft his way behind the front-runner to a victory in Iowa that can give his campaign momentum for added successes in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. Cruz himself described the strategy in a leaked discussion with donors obtained by The New York Times, calling it the “bear hug” approach.And, for a time, it worked. Cruz shot to the top of the polls in Iowa, leading many to speculate that the race for the GOP nomination would ultimately come down to a two-way competition between the conservative Cruz and the establishment favorite, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).Trump’s steady campaign against Cruz’s eligibility for the presidency and his likability appear to have reversed the senator’s momentum, however. A NBC/WSJ/Marist poll released Thursday showed an 11-point negative swing in Cruz's support from just three weeks ago, knocking him out of the lead. At the same time, Cruz's favorability rating among Republicans dropped 9 percentage points to 55 percent, according to a new Gallup poll.Trump’s boycott of Thursday's Republican presidential debate in Des Moines gave Cruz the opening he needed. The senator, a debate champion in college, challenged his rival to face off “mano-a-mano, Donald and me.” On Friday, a day after Trump held his own rally to support veterans instead of attending the GOP debate, Cruz accused Trump of disrespecting Iowa caucus-goers and said he showed a lack of “humility” that is essential for the presidency.David Sennert, a resident of Pocahontas, Iowa, agreed. Sennert said he initially supported Trump, but now favors Cruz because Trump is “too full of himself.” He added that Cruz “is much more down to earth and much more level-headed.”Cruz thrilled voters who gathered for his stump speech at several stops on Friday across Kossuth County, a stretch of sparsely populated farmland. Nearly all of those who spoke to HuffPost at a pair of Cruz events said they liked what he stood for and were likely to caucus for him on Feb. 1. But some said they feared Trump may continue bashing Cruz with the citizenship issue.“I worry what Trump can do if he gets a lawsuit,” said Nancy Nesheim, who decided to caucus for Cruz after hearing him speak for the first time at a community college library in nearby Emmetsburg. “I know you can tie it up in courts for a long time.”Mark Vanderploeg, a resident of Spirit Lake, Iowa, who leans toward Cruz, conceded Trump's right to press the birther issue.“I don’t really have a problem with it,"" he said of Cruz' eligibility to run. ""I don’t have a problem with Trump questioning it, either, because it’s really never been settled. I think it’d be good to have that question settled at some point in time.” It’s not clear whether Cruz' birthplace is a major factor in his sinking poll numbers.Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, disputed the notion that Trump had found success on the eligiblity issue. He claimed instead that since the end of November, when Cruz took the lead in Iowa, the campaign has actually expanded its net share of the vote, despite losing some voters. And he said the campaign's massive war chest -- $19 million in cash on hand as of Dec. 31 -- would help defend Cruz from such attacks.“We're having real conversations with the people, and they’re making their minds up,” Roe told reporters at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg Politics. “So we've certainly lost people. We've certainly lost and regained people. But it is all based on the delta of a growing number all the way through. Which, I think, is going to continue to grow.”CORRECTION: This article previously misstated the definition of the term ""anchor baby"" as being children brought to, rather than born in, the U.S. by undocumented immigrants."

They take their role very seriously,"" said Tom Henderson, chairman of the Democratic Party in Polk County, home to Iowa's biggest city, Des Moines.The caucuses will begin on Monday at 7 p.m. CST, and results are expected within two or three hours. Most gatherings will be in schools, community centers or other public locations, although at least two Republican caucuses will be in private homes and one Democratic caucus will be held at an equestrian center.Turnout varies by community, with up to 1,000 people typically gathering in cities like Des Moines, while a few dozen or less may gather in more sparsely populated areas.The state Republican and Democratic parties run their caucuses separately, although in some areas they hold them in different parts of the same building. Republicans will have more than 800 caucus sites, and Democrats will have about 1,100.The two parties also have different rules. Iowa Democrats gather in groups by candidate preference in a public display of support, a tradition that can allow for shifts back and forth. If a candidate does not reach the threshold of support of 15 percent of voters in a caucus needed to be considered viable, that candidates' supporters are released to back another contender, leading to another round of persuasion.Republicans are more straightforward. They write their vote privately on a sheet of paper that is collected and counted at the site by caucus officials. A surrogate or volunteer from each campaign may speak to their neighbors in a last-ditch plea for support, adding to the uncertainty going into the process.Neither party is offering voter turnout estimates this year, although many Iowans predict the Republicans will surpass the 121,503 who turned out in 2012. In the last contested Democratic caucus, in 2008, excitement over Barack Obama's candidacy spurred a record turnout of 239,872.Iowa, the 30th most populated state, and tiny New Hampshire, which holds the second nominating contest on Feb. 9, have traditionally served as early filters to winnow out the losers and elevate the top contenders for later contests.But Iowa Republicans recently have had a spotty record at backing the ultimate presidential nominees. Neither the Republican winner in 2008, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, nor the winner in 2012, former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum, managed to win the party nomination.Iowa Democrats did back the party's last two nominees: John Kerry in 2004 and Obama in 2008, which ultimately launched Obama's drive to the White House.(Editing by Leslie Adler)SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency."

This week, the city made public a sweeping consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice that aims to bring its police department and municipal practices in line with the Constitution.But progress remains slow. St. Louis County, which includes Ferguson and has constitutional problems of its own, has yet to resolve a flashpoint of the Ferguson protests. It's still pressing forward with its prosecution of The Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly and The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery, who covered those protests. Earlier this month, Craig J. Concannon, the municipal judge assigned to the reporters' case, denied their motions to dismiss the spurious charges against them -- trespassing on private property and interference with a police officer. The charges, which came out of nowhere nearly a year after the protests, stemmed from a rough encounter between St. Louis police and the reporters, who had made the Ferguson McDonald's their meeting place and newsroom-on-the-go.Because the arrests and belated charges against Reilly and Lowery drew widespread media condemnation against St. Louis County, one would've expected Concannon to issue a thoughtful, well-reasoned decision -- not just to satisfy the court of public opinion, but also the next court that might review it.Instead, Concannon issued this:On its face, Concannon's order says nothing about Reilly's case or the legal arguments his lawyer offered for why it should be thrown out of court. For what it's worth, the order doesn't even spell his name correctly.But it does make one noteworthy point: that the reporter's request to dismiss the case is denied ""for the reasons outlined in St. Louis County's Memorandum in opposition.""In other words, the judge adopted wholesale the county's side. Nobody knows why he agreed with the county or why he disagreed with Reilly. All we know is that St. Louis County had the better argument just because.To be sure, Concannon is likely not obligated under court rules to issue a full-blown opinion. But he did accept briefs from the reporters, then from the county, and then again from the reporters. In November, he scheduled a hearing and heard from the lawyers. You'd think such formalisms and use of judicial resources would lead to something more substantive.But then again, the absence of anything more reminds us how insignificant this municipal case is in the first place. Reilly and Lowery aren't facing criminal charges. Their offenses, if one can call them that, barely rise to the level of ""quality of life"" violations -- the kinds of cases that, on most days, result in a slap on the wrist and a small fine for the worst of violators. Sometimes, when the case is weak or not worth pursuing, municipalities just drop the whole thing in an exercise of prosecutorial discretion.But to hear Peter Krane, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, tell the story of what happened at the McDonald's, you'd think the reporters got what they deserved for their lawlessness during ""an acute and unprecedented period of civil unrest"" in Ferguson, as he put it in his brief opposing Reilly and Lowery's petition to dismiss the case.The reporters' case is actually pretty simple: Krane did a bad job in bringing a prosecution in the first place. Not from a press freedom standpoint, mind you, but from a jurisdictional one.Jurisdiction is the power to hear a case. Every court needs jurisdiction -- over people, cases, places. Without it, not even the Supreme Court will hear your pleas. Your case will be dismissed.Krane doesn't have a case, the reporters' lawyers argued, because Concannon has no authority to hear it. And this all goes back to the McDonald's in Ferguson.Under local law, the St. Louis County Municipal Court only has jurisdiction over violations occurring within the unincorporated areas of the county. But Ferguson is fully incorporated -- with its own charter, cops and court. It has its own set of ordinances. It follows, then, that the St. Louis County government lacks the authority to go after whatever may have gone down at the McDonald's. And its court lacks the jurisdiction to hear any such case.That's precisely the argument that Brendan Roediger, a law professor at St. Louis University, made on behalf of a number of protesters who were charged with ordinance violations similar to those Reilly and Lowery are accused of, based on incidents that also occurred in Ferguson.""It's not a power that St. Louis County has ever claimed it's possessed,"" Roediger told The Huffington Post. After he filed his motion, the county voluntarily dismissed the charges against three of his clients -- with no need for additional briefing, court appearances or undue delays.(In a separate case arising from the events in Ferguson, Roediger is challenging the constitutionality of the county's interference ordinance itself, which he says is even broader than Ferguson's and virtually ""makes all human behavior illegal."") But the case of Reilly and Lowery seems stuck in a parallel universe. Krane is going through all the motions with them. He seems confident that St. Louis County could invoke its ""emergency police powers"" to arrest and charge the reporters in the manner that it did -- and that jurisdiction is proper and that he'll pursue the case to the fullest extent, because that's what low-level prosecutors do.And then there's the judge, who, after the case was fully briefed, argued and submitted, sat on his one-page ruling from November to January for no apparent reason. Justice delayed is common, particularly when the cases, the filings and the legal specifics are complex. But there is nothing inherently complex about this case. No matter how you look at it, the petty prosecution of Reilly and Lowery flies in the face of press freedoms and seems engineered to produce one result alone: to make an example of two reporters doing their jobs at a time when the people of Ferguson just wanted answers."

It sounds crazy, but I can say I'm a grand slam champion now.""Kerber sought inspiration from Graf during a trip to the 46-year-old's Las Vegas home last year and put in a performance worthy of her mentor.She defended brilliantly throughout the two-hour and eight-minute cliff-hanger, showing nerves of steel to fend off Williams who had roared back from 5-2 down in the deciding set.In a final game riven with tension, Williams succumbed on the first match point with a volley that floated well past the baseline. Kerber was already flopping to the ground before the ball had landed, and she flung her racquet away as a packed crowd of 15,000 roared in elation and disbelief.The 34-year-old Williams has no liking for runner-up finishes at grand slams, and her defeat was the first in a final since her shock loss to Sam Stosur at the 2011 U.S. Open.Her hopes of pulling off a rare calendar grand slam were left in tatters once again, only four months after they were crushed in the U.S. Open semi-finals by Italian Roberta Vinci.GRACIOUS IN DEFEATWilliams was nonetheless gracious in defeat, walking directly to Kerber's side of the court to embrace her warmly as the champion wept with joy.""She had an attitude that I think a lot of people can learn from: just to always stay positive and to never give up,"" Williams told reporters.""I was really inspired by that. So, honestly, she's a really good girl. If I couldn't win, I'm happy she did.""I mean, every time I walk in this room, everyone expects me to win every single match, every single day of my life. As much as I would like to be a robot, I'm not. I try to.""It was instead an all-too-human display by Williams in an opening set laden with 23 unforced errors -- 20 more than her opponent.Kerber broke her twice to wrap up the set before Williams regrouped to send the match into a decider, accompanied by screams of ""C'mon!""The German played majestically in the decider's marathon sixth game, taking Williams's serve on her fifth break point to move to a 5-2 lead.The American, summoning the belief forged from 25 grand slam finals, stormed back to break Kerber as she served for the match.But the German responded brilliantly, felling Williams in a furious baseline rally to raise her one and only match point.The first left-hander to win in Melbourne since Monica Seles's 1999 championship, Kerber proved the world number one can be beaten, even when fit and firing.Other challengers will draw hope that they, too, might share in the grand slam spoils as the 34-year-old icon edges closer to retirement.For Kerber, however, it was a triumph long in the making. It arrived in her 33rd main draw appearance and at a tournament that could have ended for her in the first round.She had to save a match point in a three-set duel with Japan's Misaki Doi and later remarked that she had ""one leg in the plane.""A former world number five in 2012, Kerber will soar to second when the rankings are updated.""I think my phone is exploding right now,"" said Kerber, who received personal congratulations from Graf and German chancellor Angela Merkel.""I have so many emotions it's like crazy.""In the late match at Rod Laver Arena, Jamie Murray, men's single finalist Andy's elder brother, won his first men's doubles title with Bruno Soares after they beat Daniel Nestor and Radek Stepanek 2-6 6-4 7-5.The younger Murray will seek his first Australian Open title at Melbourne Park after four fruitless trips to the final when he takes on defending champion and his Melbourne Park nemesis Novak Djokovic.Also on HuffPost:"
