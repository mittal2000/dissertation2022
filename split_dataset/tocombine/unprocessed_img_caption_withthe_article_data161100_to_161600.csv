During a heated Roundtable discussion on “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,” the Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist told Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) that he had all the wrong facts on Social Security. “Your facts are false,” Krugman told Johnson, adding, “It's important to realize that the facts that are being brought out here are in fact, non-facts.”Krugman was taking issue with Johnson’s claim that the fiscal health of the Social Security program is in danger because its trust fund doesn’t really exist. Krugman argued on “This Week” that Johnson was “changing the rules midstream” by denying that Social Security has a dedicated revenue base. Krugman has criticized Social Security detractors for making similar claims in the past. The program is funded both by the federal budget and by a law that gives it a dedicated source of revenue, according to Krugman. That means that even when the money going into the program may be less than the money it's paying out, its fiscal health isn’t at risk because the program still has the money it needs to run. Still, that doesn’t mean the Social Security program can run in its current form forever. The trust fund is scheduled to run out by 2033. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have said they would be willing to make changes to Social Security do deal with the country’s deficit problems. But they’re far off from an agreement; Republicans say they won’t raise taxes to fix the program, while Democrats don’t want to cut benefits.

""So when it is possible to cut, there is a terribly strong reason to do so.""According to Lundberg's survey, which canvases about 2,500 gas stations, the U.S. city with the most expensive gas was Los Angeles, where a gallon cost $4.23. Drivers in Billings, Montana, were paying the least at $3.31 a gallon.The price of crude oil has eased lately due to the strong U.S. dollar and increasing U.S. reserves, which are often cheaper than imported crude, Lundberg said. But since crude accounts for about 71 percent of the price at the pump, any unforeseen increase in crude prices could turn prices higher, she cautioned.

Now they are also expressing disquiet over the scarcity of information about the environment available to them.For incoming President Xi Jinping, who formally takes over towards the end of the parliament session, the two-pronged challenge is to find the balance between growth and further degradation of the environment, and also to decide whether to level with citizens just how bad the problem is.""The significance of this event goes far beyond just environmental protection,"" said Dong, in an interview with Reuters. ""It concerns the problem China has had for many years - the issue of government transparency. (They) shouldn't use 'state secrets' as a shield when they're not in the right."" The environment has already been one of one of the most frequently raised issues at the annual parliament session and China's authoritarian government has admitted it has a problem.""Our country, in a very short time over the past 30 years, has achieved brilliant economic achievements,"" Xin Chunying, vice-director of the NPC standing committee's working group on the legal system, told reporters on Saturday.""But at the same time, we have paid a heavy price with the environment. This price must stop, it has to be reduced, we must say 'no' to the status quo.""China does not usually allow public scrutiny of governance, particularly on sensitive issues such as corruption and security. But public anger over the environment may force authorities to accommodate the public in small ways.""In other areas it is still dangerous,"" said Gary Liu, a professor at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. ""But pollution is a relatively safe area, because people have enough justification to fight against the government and they can easily get enough public support because everybody is in the same country, breathes the same air."" SILENT KILLERA choking smog in Beijing in January, far above hazardous levels, has been one of the most dramatic signs of China's environmental problems, but Dong is convinced that soil pollution is the country's ""silent killer.""About 40 percent of China's agricultural land is irrigated with underground water, of which 90 percent is polluted, according to Liu Xin, a food and health expert and a member of an advisory body to parliament, who was quoted in the Southern Metropolitan Daily.Citing ""state secrets"", the environment ministry last month denied a request from Dong for information on data on soil samples that was collected in a national survey that started in 2006 and ended in 2010.The decision was perplexing to Dong, since he had been given signals that authorities would be accommodating on environmental issues.He said after filing more than 10 lawsuits against other government departments in 2008, officials from the legislative affairs office of the State Council, or cabinet, pleaded with him to stop suing those agencies and ""sue the environment ministry on the basis of the public's interest"".The government has caved in to public pressure for access to environmental information before. In early 2012, amid growing public outrage about air quality in the capital city, Beijing began announcing publicly the amount of tiny pollution particles in the air that measure 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter.""Before the release of PM 2.5, there was controversy, some people thought that releasing the information on air quality may lead to panic in the society,"" Yan Chengzhong, a Shanghai delegate, said on the sidelines of the parliament session, according to the Wen Wei Po newspaper.""But the facts proved this is not the case. 'Being unaware' would only cause people to panic.""And just last month, the government acknowledged for the first time that pollution had given rise to ""cancer villages"", admitting that cancer rates in villages near factories and polluted rivers were far higher than they should be.But examples of the environment ministry's shortcomings abound.Pan Zhizhong, a resident in Panguanying village in northeastern Hebei province, has led his village of 1,900 people in protesting against the construction of an incinerator plant since 2009.When Pan sued the Hebei Department of Environmental Protection in 2011, he was given access to the environmental impact assessment that the environment ministry claimed it had done in the village. Pan discovered that the assessment, carried out by the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences, had names of people who had left the village two decades previously and even a person who had been dead for two years - all ""expressing favour"" for the project.Pan surveyed 100 people in his village, showing them the purported environmental impact study. The majority of them gave him written statements that declared: ""I've never seen this form,"" according to documents seen by Reuters. A PRICE TO PAYSometimes, challenging the government comes at a cost.Chen Yuqian, 60, a farmer from the town of Pailian in eastern Zhejiang province, said he has been beaten up five times in his decade-long fight against soil and water pollution --beatings for which he blames local officials.On February 20, Chen issued a challenge on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, daring officials from the local environment protection bureau to swim in a stretch of polluted river. He offered 300,000 yuan ($48,200) as a reward.Four days later, dozens of men, carrying sticks and rocks, charged into his home and started smashing things, Chen said.""They are trying to scare me so that I don't petition anymore, so that I don't report on the pollution anymore,"" Chen said.Xu Shuifa, the Communist Party secretary of the district that governs Chen's village, told Reuters by telephone that he had no links to the attackers and said the attack was linked to a land dispute Chen has with three of his neighbours.Back in Beijing, Dong, the attorney, said he had filed an appeal with the environment ministry for the soil survey data and expected a decision within two months. He said he would go to court if he was denied.

Such as the need to waterproof the stage.But when the production will take place not inside the Sydney Opera House but on a floating stage outside it, the greatest risk is being upstaged by the iconic building.As Opera Australia readies to unveil its $12 million outdoor Carmen later this month, the company's artistic director Lyndon Terracini has added a grasp of meteorological forecasts to his repertoire.""Half way through the season we know there'll be a king tide and we know water will come up for a couple of hours in front of the stage,"" says Terracini. ""We've put measures in place to cope with that.""The need for a waterproof stage was a lesson learned after Opera Australia ventured outside its traditional home to present its first opera on Sydney harbor last year, La Traviata, amid the constant threat of autumn rain. This year, U.S.-Israeli mezzo Rinat Shaham will perform the title role in Carmen on opening night, in a production directed by Gale Edwards, who has updated Bizet's opera to Franco's Spain. The set, by Tony-award winning designer Brian Thomson, will feature 13-meter, Hollywood-style illuminated lettering -- visible from the harbor bridge and opera house -- as well as a giant bull.The production comes as opera internationally battles for audiences. In New York, The Metropolitan will cut ticket prices next season to win back patrons. In London, the English National Opera has posted a $3.3 million loss after filling just 71 percent of its seats last financial year. Elsewhere in Europe, from Spain to Germany, many houses are facing cuts or closure.While the giant bull about to appear on Sydney harbor alludes to Carmen's bullfighting and bloodletting, it is emblematic of an attempt to grab the problems besetting the art form by the horns.As a means to draw new audiences, the gamble is paying off. Last year's first fully staged outdoor production of La Traviata, directed by Glimmerglass's Francesca Zambello, was well-received artistically and at the box office. Indeed, more than 60 percent of ticket buyers to La Traviata were newcomers to opera. The figure surprised the company and has encouraged it to make an opera on the harbor an annual event.Whether those first-time patrons were motivated to then buy tickets for operas in the more formal environment within the Sydney Opera House is not yet known.Nonetheless, the company enjoyed a bumper season in the months following, playing to 92 percent capacity houses. As a result, the company predicts posting a substantial surplus for 2012. Music to any opera director's ears.Outdoor opera is artistically risky. Some say it compromises the art form and that amplifying the singers' voices destroys opera's unique element, the sound of the unadulterated human voice.Terracini, a former baritone, rejects this. He argues that some contemporary operatic composers, such as Louis Andriessen, have written specifically for amplified voices. Bizet, of course, did not.""We have to have absolute integrity about the show we're doing and make sure we perform it at the highest possible level and not just go for spectacle,"" Terracini says.Taking opera out of traditional venues is part of the company's strategy to widen the reach of the art form. There is not one audience but many, Terracini argues. The search for them has taken the company to a remote Aboriginal community in recent months where it developed and performed a new work, Yarrabah.While Opera Australia's Ring Cycle to be staged later this year in Melbourne will draw a vastly different audience, so too will an opera on the drawing board about the WikiLeaks controversy. The piece will be staged via the same medium Wikileaks founder Julian Assange used to disseminate his classified documents: the internet.""We're actively going out and looking for audiences that will respond to opera in the 21st century rather than continuing to do what opera companies have done for so long,"" Terracini says. ""We couldn't keep doing that. We'd be out of business.""Carmen, Opera on Sydney harbor, runs from March 22 to April 12, 2013.Joyce Morgan is a Sydney-based arts journalist and writer.

The ""complete"" collection features 550 previously uncollected poems and more than 50 previously unpublished poems that editor Thomas Pinney -- an English professor at California's Pomona College -- discovered stashed in private collections throughout the world.Kipling is probably best known here in the States as the author of The Jungle Book, Kim and Captains Courageous, but he was also a prolific and accomplished poet. You may have read his most-quoted poem, ""If,"" which concludes with the stanza:If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  Or walk with Kings--nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,  Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,  And -- which is more -- you'll be a Man, my son!Though he was a Nobel Laureate, Kipling is a controversial figure in the literary world. He was a strong voice for colonialism and the British Empire -- at times, from a contemporary perspective, shockingly so. He was, less controversially, a voice for the common soldier. He wrote ""The Absent-Minded Beggar"" to raise money for troops in fighting in the Boer War in South Africa. Here's an excerpt:WHEN you've shouted ""Rule Britannia,"" when you've sung ""God save the Queen,""  When you've finished killing Kruger with your mouth, Will you kindly drop a shilling in my little tambourine For a gentleman in khaki ordered South?  He's an absent-minded beggar, and his weaknesses are great--  But we and Paul must take him as we find him--  He is out on active service, wiping something off a slate  And he's left a lot of little things behind him!  Duke's son--cook's son - son of a hundred kings  (Fifty thousand horse and foot going to Table Bay!)  Each of 'em doing his country's work (and who's to look after their things?) Pass the hat for your credit's sake, and pay--pay--pay !It will be interesting to see how the new poems add to our knowledge of Kipling. The Guardian recently gave us a first taste, printing an unpublished poem called ""The Press"" in which Kipling grumbles about the questions fired at him by the media. It begins with the lines,Why don't you write a play - Why don't you cut your hair? Do you trim your toe-nails round  Or do you trim them square?Kipling fans will have to wait for the anthology to see the rest. And they'll certainly have to ""pay--pay--pay!""

The Berlin-based artist depicts human beings wrapped up in the fabric of nature. Ocean waves, grassy hills and racing streams become drapery in her fantastic visions, reminding us of the never-realized lovechild of John Millais' ""Ophelia"" and Oleg Shuplyak's optical illusions. Moki was raised in a small town in Germany surrounded by the woods, allowing her youthful imagination to run wild. The artist, inspired by Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki, explained how her childhood fantasies continue to shape her artistic practice in an interview with Erratic Phenomena: ""As a child, I often thought about being very huge, being able to see everything from above. I imagined things like a giant sitting in the hayfield next to our house -– so tall that his head was in the clouds -– or I would lie in my bed and feel as tiny as an ant. My little brother told me that he imagines driving over the hills in a car that has huge balloon tires.""See Moki's works below and head to her website to learn more. "

More and more people are seeking and finding romantic relationships online. Often drawn to the potential of creating your own profile and being able to carefully shape your image before someone actually meets you in person, users are regularly tempted to embellish or even omit key pieces of personal information. While being mindful that there are always people in this world who are pathological liars, others merely want to make themselves appear as attractive as possible. As a result, when being less than truthful in filling out a dating website profile, they often convince themselves that the end will justify the means. They assume that if they can be more alluring to potential matches, their dating opportunities will then increase. This way of thinking often extend to users believing that it's not a big deal to be identified as single when in fact they are separated, or even going as far as not revealing that they are a parent when they have children at home.The potential risks of these exaggerations and omissions are serious when the person filling out an online dating profile dishonestly also happens to be married, separated or going through a divorce or child custody case. What may seem like simple exaggerations at the time can be used as evidence against their own trustworthiness and commitment to their children. Worse yet, the person responding to a post on a dating site may be dragged into the deceiver's divorce as an innocent witness to the deceiver's character and possibly adulterous behavior.According to a recent survey of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (AAML), 59% of respondents said they have seen an increase in the number of divorce cases using evidence taken from dating websites during the past three years. Sixty-four percent of respondents have seen evidence taken specifically from Match.com. Of the type of information being taken from these sites, 57% of lawyers have seen relationship status used, followed by salary and occupation at 15% and parental status at 7%. This is one of the many reasons I have always strongly advised clients to stay off dating websites until the divorce is concluded. Volunteering personal information about yourself online during one of the most emotionally vulnerable periods of your life is just not a good idea and can have serious and unintended consequences.Of course, this always leads to an overall discussion on the general issues of traditional dating during a separation or divorce process. It's one thing to tell your spouse that you don't want to be married anymore, it's another thing to openly demonstrate it and flaunt a new relationship in front of him or her. This can create an incredible amount of hostility.In addition to the anger and resentment that this can provoke, many people are not aware of the other reaction that can ensue. The hurt spouse could emotionally shut down and further withdraw from divorce and child custody negotiations. This only serves to make the process lengthier and more difficult, preventing the achievement of a reasonable and amicable settlement for both parties.Overall, if you have emotionally accepted that your marriage is over and would like to move on, be aware that there is another side to the story. Your estranged spouse will still have a say in how quickly and easily the relationship will legally end."

All this leaves the consumer paying more for basic staples such as bread and milk and is likely to have its hardest impact on poorer nations. (Photo by David Silverman/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce8a7250000360036417e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Terry Theise Lately I've been frustrating my customers, which is never a wise thing to do. We get asked all the time for analytical stats on the wines we offer and details about our winemaking practices. My catalogues tend to pass over such things, because I've reached a place in my drinking career where I find them otiose. This might seem snooty. So let me explain.First, a wise quote from Peter Jost (of the estate Toni Jost), who said: ""Judging a wine by its analysis is like judging a beautiful woman by her X-ray films."" Second, and further support for my theory, a remark I received from esteemed German winemaker Helmut Dönnhoff many years ago, when I asked him for the figures of a wine in my glass. ""You don't need these anymore, Terry,"" he said. ""Analyses are for beginners.""Related: Is it true that only dry wine is good with food?   But there are beginners, I must remember, and they're curious, and it's peevish for me to deny them the understanding they seek. If a drinker is interested in knowing how a wine was made, or in knowing what its acidity or residual-sugar or extract might be, this is entirely valid if she is trying to collate her palate's impressions with the facts of the matter. That is a useful way of thinking -- until it isn't anymore.I well remember traveling with an earnest young colleague who sought to guess how a wine was made strictly from its taste. He was especially eager to identify cask versus stainless steel aging. I loved the guy, but I knew the perplexing denouement that quivered a few days down the road. For indeed, at one winery where all the wines were done in cask, my pal was sure they used steel, and yielded to his dismay; however hard he tried, he just wasn't getting it. When I told him he'd crossed the Rubicon into a place of far greater wisdom, he thought I had a screw loose. I tried to reassure him that being right was reassuring, but being wrong invited epiphany; you ascended to greater understanding through your mistakes.Related: Why draft wines are gaining favor.  I remember, though, the urge to understand, to find explanations, to learn the causes and effects of flavor. We mustn't frustrate that urge -- it's human to be curious and I think we should respect curiosity. But we also have to help drinkers understand the limits of this vein of knowledge. It is a closed system that gives the simulacrum of expertise while actually leaving us in an airless chamber of our minds. We feel terribly knowledgeable discussing the details of a wine, but there's a big-picture glaring at us that this approach won't let us see.If you're hungry for knowledge of how a grower trains his vines, prunes his vines, binds his vines; if you seek to know the density of plantings per hectare and the space between the rows; if you're curious about which clones were used, how the canopies were worked, if and when the winemaker did a green harvest, if the grapes were picked by hand, with what-size teams and with one big bucket or several smaller ones, then these are things you ought to know. Shame on me for finding them ancillary and ultimately trivial.Related: Try aged cocktails at home. It's easy.  If you want to know the wines' total acids, the amount of its sweetness, the must-weights of the grapes at picking, whether it fermented with ambient or with cultured yeasts, how it was clarified, what vessel it fermented in and at what temperature (and if the temperature was technologically controlled), whether it sat on its gross or fine lees and for how long, and whether it was developed in steel or in wood -- I don't mind telling you. But it worries me some. Because I fear that for each one of you who sincerely wants to compare what his palate receives with what's actually inside the wine, there are many of you who want to enact value-judgments prior to tasting, because you've decided what's permissible and what's despicable. (This nonsensical approach is rampant in Germany.) I am decidedly not in favor of excluding tasters from any wine because they disapprove of the effing yeast that was deployed, or because they won't go near a wine with more than X-grams of sweetness. Who wants to enable something so repugnant?Related: What are wine writers really for?  Nor am I willing to abet the sad phenomenon of people talking about wine with what seems like authority, because of the ""information"" they've accumulated, whereas they're actually blocked from attaining true authority by the rigid limits of their approach. If you're stuck in the ""how,"" you'll have a rough time finding your way to the ""what."" And that is where true wisdom lies. The wonky isn't a bad place to be, for a while, but it's a dangerous place to stop, because like all objects of beauty, wine is more than the sum of its parts. If you're busily probing into technical minutiae, will you remember to consider not only the application of technique but the expression of a vintner's spirit? Will you remember to pause for just a second and consider how a wine makes you feel?Photo: Terry Theise.

14,FOOD & DRINK,Understanding Gluten,"Amanda Greene, Contributor
Food Scientist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/understanding-gluten_us_5b9ce73be4b03a1dcc82d866,"It's an important component in the structure and texture of baked goods as we know them. It's mostly found in wheat and, to a lesser extent, in barley and rye. So what is it?",2013-03-09,2013-03-09-UnderCorrectlyandOverbeatenMuffinslarge.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-03-09-UnderCorrectlyandOverbeatenMuffinslarge.jpg,"Gluten: It's an important component in the structure and texture of baked goods as we know them. Gluten is mostly found in wheat and, to a lesser extent, in barley and rye. What is it? Well, it's a protein -- or more technically speaking, it's a group of two proteins, glutenin and gliadin, bonded to form a network (1). This network gives structure and function to doughs and batters. They give dough the elasticity (ability to retain its shape) and plasticity (ability to be molded, as in clay) that make baked goods so unique and amazing (2).Here's how it happens: when water is added to flour, glutenin and gliadin are able to move freely and form bonds with other glutenin and gliadin molecules, thereby creating a network of protein (that's gluten!). Working the dough or batter by kneading or stirring creates more bonds and strengthens the gluten network (3). Some baked goods require a lot of gluten formation, like bread and pizza dough; others require minimal formation of gluten, like cake and muffins. That's why bread recipes call for lots of kneading, whereas cake and muffins are stirred only enough to moisten the dry ingredients. This is all for the sake of gluten formation!Let's look closer at those examples. When making bread or pizza dough, you're supposed to ""work"" or ""knead"" the dough. Kneading causes a large gluten network to form. That network is a strong, expandable structure that can hold lots of air during rising, yields a baked product that is sturdy enough to allow for extra toppings or sandwich contents without falling apart. In contrast, tenderness is the goal when it comes to cake and muffins. Here, you're supposed to stir the batter only enough to moisten the ingredients. Working the batter so little limits the ability of gluten to form. A smaller, weaker network gives just enough structure for the muffin or cake to hold its shape, but allows the finished product to be tenderer and more crumbly (see the Muffin Method).The photo below depicts an under-beaten, correctly beaten, and over-beaten muffin. You can see the lumpy, dense texture of the under-beaten muffin on the left. Its shiny top is caused by undistributed egg. The center muffin is correctly prepared, and looks normal. The muffin on the right is over-beaten, and has too much gluten. The excess gluten gives it a smoother, stiffer crust, which is not typically desirable in a muffin. In addition, the extra gluten allows steam to form large tunnels (called tunneling) in the muffin, which can cause it to buckle and collapse, as it did here.Here are cross-sections of two muffins. The muffin on the left is prepared properly, and the one on the right is over-beaten. You can clearly see the tunneling in the over-beaten muffin, both from the bottom and the side views.But there's more to gluten formation than just stirring! The type of flour you're using matters too: cake flour, pastry flour, all-purpose flour, bread flour, durum semolina (for pasta); the list goes on. What's the difference between these? Gluten! Well, technically since gluten isn't formed until water is added, let's refer to it as protein.Each type of flour has a unique protein make-up, but at this point, it's also important to note that the leftover (non-protein) portion of white wheat flour is mainly starch, which provides the soft, moisture-retaining bulk of baked goods by gelatinizing around the gluten skeleton (4). Knowing that white flour is essentially a starch-protein blend comes in handy if you have the wrong type of flour and would like to make a substitution. (See gluten-taming tip #2 below.)Here's a breakdown of the approximate protein levels of these wheat flours (5): Cake: 7-8 percent Pastry: 8-9 percent All-purpose (US national brands): 11-12 percent Bread: 12-13 percent Durum semolina: 13 percent But it's not just as simple as knowing the approximate quantity of protein in these types of flour. The quality of protein can vary as well. For example, durum semolina flour, which is used in pasta, doesn't contain significantly more protein than bread flour. Why differentiate? Because in durum semolina has more stiff, brittle proteins like glutenin, which create a dense texture with stiffer chew, perfect for pasta. On the other hand, bread flour has more soft, flexible proteins like gliadin, which create a dough that's more stretchy than brittle (6).Even among all-purpose flours there can be some differentiation. For instance, if you use a regional brand of flour, particularly in the Pacific Northwest or the South, your protein content is often closer to 7.5-9.5 percent (7). This could explain why your niece in Portland could never get her bread to look quite the same as yours in Boston, even though she used your exact recipe. Similarly, if you dine in Europe, you'll be sure to appreciate their crusty baguettes, but you might notice they make a lousy muffin. Why? They may use the same recipes as we do in America, but European wheat has a stiffer protein content (higher in glutenin) than our more delicate American wheats (higher in gliadin). So, even with the same recipes, we find it difficult to perfectly replicate their crusty breads and they find it difficult to mimic the tenderness of our muffins.Gluten-taming tips:Gluten-taming tip #1: Working your dough or batter. Knead your dough according to recipe specs. Kneading more or less will impact the amount of gluten formed and thereby impact your final texture and appearance. (This goes for stirring as well.)Gluten-taming tip #2: Choose your flour wisely! If your recipe calls for pastry flour but you only have all-purpose, you know what the difference is! If you simply substitute all-purpose flour for pastry flour, you'll have too much protein in your dough and your product will come out tough (unless of course you're using a local brand from the South or Pacific Northwest). All is not lost, however. As I mentioned earlier, wheat flour is basically just starch and protein. So if the flour you have on hand has too much protein, you could substitute plain starch (corn starch will usually do just fine) for a portion of your flour to bring the overall protein content down. Alternatively, if your recipe calls for bread flour but you only have all-purpose, you would need to compensate by adding something called vital wheat gluten. This is basically gluten that's been separated from regular flour. Most vital wheat gluten is 70-85 percent gluten (8). Making adjustments yourself to the protein content of your flour is not likely to be very precise, as each brand will differ somewhat in protein content to begin with. However, it's a great trick to have up your sleeve in a pinch. For example, I might employ the technique of substituting starch for a portion of my flour if I had a brownie recipe that consistently came out a little dry or lacking in tenderness. Instead of buying pastry flour, I could just tweak the flour to be tenderer by using ingredients I already have on hand. (Of course, there are other factors that can impact tenderness too. Click here to see a troubleshooting chart.)Gluten-taming tip #3: Using whole wheat instead of white: Whole wheat flour varies in protein content more than white flour. It can contain anywhere from 11-15 percent protein (9). However, the bran acts as a physical barrier to gluten formation in the dough and therefore will result in denser products with less ability to rise (10). You can compensate for this by using additional leaveners, and by allowing half of the flour used in any whole-wheat recipe to be white. Another thing to note about whole wheat flour is that it contains fats that are normally removed in the processing of white flour (11). These fats are prone to rancidity (producing off flavors and smells), and as a result, whole wheat flour has a much shorter shelf life. Protecting it from light and heat exposure can slow down this process. Keeping your whole wheat flour in the fridge will make it last longer.A nutritional note: The methods for controlling gluten formation outlined in this article are meant to relate only to how gluten impacts food, not how it impacts your body. If you are on a gluten-free diet, you should continue to avoid wheat, barley and rye products altogether. Always consult your doctor before making major changes in your diet.References: 1.

There is an overwhelming number of women who feel unappreciated by their husbands. I often hear the following refrain: ""I just want to feel appreciated. For years I have been the cook, the cleaner, the chauffeur... I don't feel like we are a partnership... I've asked, demanded and pleaded that we go to counseling... I can't do this anymore. I don't want to live the second half of my life feeling like this. I'm done.""I'm sure this is nothing new. I am sure my mother felt unappreciated by my dad at times during their marriage. I think that's probably natural in the cycle of marriage and relationships. Life gets busy. We forget to thank those closest to us. But times are changing. I have spoken with more women than I can count over the past couple of years who aren't just complaining about feeling unappreciated by their husbands. Instead, they are doing something about it. These women, most of whom are in their mid-40's, have decided they want out of their marriages. Sure, they are scared for what this means for them. Sure, they are nervous about the new unknowns divorce will bring. Sure, they recognize the impact this will have on their lives. For most of the women I spoke with, leaving their husbands means having to secure full-time employment for the first time in years. It mean moving out of the big brick colonial in the suburbs and moving into something more affordable. It means being alone. And you know what each and every woman I spoke with said? ""I am absolutely OK with this."" I heard, ""I'm OK being alone and starting over on my own... I feel as if I have been alone for years anyway. I don't need my big house or my fancy car. I don't mind having to work. I just know that I don't want to spend the next half of my life living this way. Why should I?"" Wow! To give it all up and start over at 45? It's surprising, particularly because to the outside world, these women appear to have it all. Their husbands aren't ""bad"" people. We aren't talking about men who are abusive or alcoholics. We aren't talking about men who are dragging the family into bankruptcy. We aren't talking about men who have lived a double life full of affairs. What these women are expressing is a deep personal sadness at feeling disconnected and unappreciated by their husbands. They tell me they have fought for years to feel more connected and appreciated. This isn't a whim, they assure me. They have thought long and hard about their decision to get divorced. They aren't simply giving up. They have tried and fought a long battle. But the thing they each have in common is that they have reached their breaking point. They say, ""I'm tired of not feeling appreciated, not feeling like I am part of a partnership. I feel like I am the roommate, the bill payer, the cook, the cleaner, the chauffeur... but not someone who is valued and appreciated. I'm tired of asking to be appreciated -- begging to be valued -- pleading to feel I as if I am important and not constantly playing second-fiddle to everything else going on in his life. I'm done."" Divorce has become commonplace. Many women thrive after divorce. They live independent, happy lives. Any taboo or stigma that may have existed during my mother's generation doesn't exist any more. I think this gives many women the courage to say, ""I can do this."" And, they are.What do we do about this? Many husbands are left with their jaws hanging open in disbelief when their wives file for divorce. ""Why didn't we talk about this? Why didn't we go to counseling? Why didn't you tell me you were feeling this way?"" The wives smile sadly and say, ""We have, we did, I have... and it's too late now... I'm done."" I don't like these conversations. I believe in the institution of marriage. I don't like to see people quit. What can we do? I know the following advice is oversimplifying the issue -- I really do -- but it's a start: Men, please take the time to appreciate your wife regularly. Thank her for what she does for you and your family. Validate her. Cover her with words of affirmation. Wrap your appreciation of her deep within her heart. This is a marathon, not a sprint. The women I spoke with are not giving up because they weren't thanked for emptying the dishwasher once. It's the net result of decades of feeling taken for granted. When I suggest that perhaps having an open dialogue with their husbands alerting them to just how serious this really is and perhaps giving a final chance to make some changes, they tell me it would be too little, too late. ""I'm done,"" they say.Clearly, women, this isn't a one-way street. Appreciation goes both ways. Are you checking to see just how much appreciation you are showing to your husband as well? Do you thank him for all he does, or do you take him for granted? Really think about it. Perhaps you perceive that you are being more appreciative than you really are. What would he say?I'm not saying that showing more appreciation will lower the divorce rate in our country, but I do believe that showing more appreciation will improve marital relationships. After all, it's like basketball superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once said, ""If not shown appreciation, it gets to you."" And it seems that ""it gets to you"" is leading more and more towards, ""I'm done."" What do you think?"

Going beyond the handshake she ventures to give me a hug and I am filled with gratitude for the simple gesture. Perhaps it was because of the way she maintained eye contact during our meeting when no one else would or maybe could. Shaking her head with empathy as we described Sam's struggles to fit in, I felt a connection and hope that she is a mother too, because then she will tuck him under her wing and protect him from harm for the 50 minutes he is in her class. At least this is what I want to believe because it is too hard for me to imagine anything else.Saying goodbye to the gym teacher we can see in his unsympathetic eyes that he thinks this is complete crap. Already outfitted for the day with a standard issue whistle and stopwatch around his neck, we are wasting his time. Checking his watch 15 minutes into the meeting we are not confident he understands, much less cares, but we need him to at least try to pretend because Phys. Ed. is so stressful for Sam. Choosing teams. Lining up in girl's lines and boy's lines. Changing clothes in a locker room that does not fit with the gender in which he identifies -- all psychological mine fields for our child, who is not yet equipped to protect himself from emotional harm.We can sense the band director feels our angst, but when she gets back to her office will she remember the seating chart for the horn section is crucial to Sam's well being? Does she recall that a fellow band member began calling Sam ""It,"" last year, under the direction of his parents? Encouraging their son to use the term whenever referring to our child because ""It"" wasn't conforming to their, albeit ignorant, understanding of gender. ""Please remember not to sit him next to Brian,"" I whisper to myself, silently willing her to oblige.""Thank you for your time,"" we say, trying to convey one last time with words and body language how much we appreciate whatever they can do for Sam, but I am afraid we sound insincere because we are emotionally drained. We know they are overworked and underpaid and we cringe at the thought of adding anything more to their plates. As we head out the door, I notice the cold, institutional steel framed clock hanging on the wall, the same model that was in my junior high 30 years before, and think about the long and lonely eight hours my son has ahead. And I hope one last time that his teachers truly understand they are not only providing Sam with an education, but more importantly they are serving as a lifeline while he is in their care."
