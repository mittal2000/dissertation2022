My maternal grandmother, whom we called Popo, the Chinese word for grandmother, came to live with us a few years later.""You should be proud you are Hakka,"" Popo told my brother and me.As the only children of color in our school, we had little interest in learning about being more Chinese, we just wanted to fit in. But Popo persisted. After school, she tried to teach us how to speak Hakka and write Chinese characters in her kitchen. Then she'd often cook dinner for us -- stir-fried vegetables from her garden, homemade chicken soup, steamed eggs, or sometimes our favorite dish, an aromatic stew of braised Chinese bacon and potatoes.Related: How the ""Hakka Cookbook"" connects with Chinese soul food.   More than five decades later, I had forgotten most of the Chinese, but her words echoed in my mind. I had recently left Sunset magazine where I wrote food stories for more than 34 years. Now I had time to research what she meant when she said, ""You should be proud you are Hakka."" I would do it through what I knew best, food. Popo had passed away decades ago, and so had my parents. It was too late to ask them questions. I wish I could have asked Popo how she came to America. How she cooked the bacon and potato stew that my brother and I still remember today. But I would have to figure it out myself.Related: How China's tea traditions are evolving. I turned to a Hakka friend who lived nearby. We spent many sessions in the kitchen. She cooked and I took notes and photos. Smells and flavors from my childhood came back as I tasted some of her dishes. I decided to expand my scope and follow the footsteps of the Hakka diaspora.I visited some areas where there were Hakka settlements such as Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Toronto and Lima, Peru. There I watched grandmothers, grandfathers and aunts demonstrate their Hakka specialties. In my cooking sessions, a younger relative often came along to translate. Over and over, the younger generation said they didn't know how to prepare these dishes. The Hakka cuisine was getting lost through intermarriage and assimilation. I realized I was recording recipes to pass on to the next generation.Related: Why family meals aren't just about food. You don't need to be a professional writer to record your own family history and recipes. Just spend some time with the person who cooks your favorite dishes. The standard bearers of your family's culinary heritage won't be around forever. Don't wait too long, as I did. Do it now.The easiest way to learn a recipe is to watch while the dish is being cooked. Simply observe, take notes, ask questions, taste and take photos. Or better yet, record a video. If needed, ask your mentor to slow down, use measuring cups, or a timer. Record the names and amounts of the ingredients. Translate your notes into legible directions and try cooking your recipe, optimally with your mentor at your side. Fine-tune the recipe and write in all the corrections. Final test, follow your written recipe to see whether the words can produce a dish that meets with the approval of your mentor. Repeat the exercise, and you'll soon have enough recipes for your own family cookbook.The recipes will be a legacy to pass on. You will honor your mentor with this shared experience.Top photo: Linda Lau Anusasananan.Zester Daily Soapbox contributor Linda Lau Anusasananan, a recipe editor and food writer at Sunset Magazine for 34 years, is the author of ""The Hakka Cookbook.""

We've compiled 20 tips on how to get the most for your travel dollars and book your dream honeymoon for the best possible price.By Sherri Eisenberg1. Price out airfare first. Before you settle on a honeymoon destination, remember that a major factor in comparing destinations is the airfare. For example, say you want to go to an island in the Caribbean. Some isles, such as Jamaica and Puerto Rico, get plenty of nonstop service from the United States, while others, like Anguilla and Nevis, require a connection, often on a smaller local airline. Decide if you're willing to pay for another travel leg, and work that expense into your spending plan.2. Use common sense. While your dream honeymoon destination may have been beyond your budget in the past, the global recession has hit some spots harder than others. So check if your favored locale has suddenly come into reach. Related: 13 Affordable Honeymoon Destinations  3. Beware of holidays and other special events. Nothing jacks up prices more than a holiday or major event. Expect to pay top rates during the winter season around Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year's Eve. If you're planning a spring honeymoon, be sure to check when Easter and spring break fall in your particular destination. Look for local seasonality as well; wine-country rates rise during the grape-harvest season, while New England asks a premium during autumn leaf-peeping time. Illustration by: Edwin Fotheringham4. Consider shoulder season. Working with a tight budget and feeling priced out of your choice spot? Look into similar locales that are in shoulder season (in between high and low seasons). For example, peak season in Bermuda starts later than in the Caribbean because it's located farther north. Have your heart set on a locale but are more flexible with timing? Hawaii has better deals in spring and fall, when family travel is limited due to school schedules. Related: Best Honeymoon Destinations by Season5. Be prepared for low season. While some great low-season bargains are out there, you need to know the risks. Head to the Caribbean during hurricane season or to the Pacific during the monsoon months, and you'll get amazing deals -- but you also have a higher chance of encountering storms. If you want to take your chances, ask about guarantees or travel insurance.6. Look into travel registries. Couples who already have a fully stocked household may find that registering for their trip is a great way to cancel out some of the costs of activities, meals and more. Choose from many programs, including those offered through a resort (Marriott, Starwood, Sandals), a destination (Aruba), a tour operator (Backroads, Mountain Travel Sobek), a cruise line (Carnival) or an online booking agency (HoneyLuna). Related: 3 Things to Know About Honeymoon Registries7. Price out packages. As a rule of thumb, travel packages that combine flights, hotel stays and extras like excursions and airport transfers are a great way to get more for less -- if you want everything they offer. Don't assume you've found a good deal before you price out the pieces a la carte. The same is true for all-inclusives and cruises: travelers who don't drink and just want to sun all day may find that an all-inclusive resort is more expensive than a pay-as-you-go one. 8. Factor in all the costs. The biggest mistake you can make is assuming that airfare plus hotel price equals the total cost. You have to get yourselves to and from both airports, pay taxes along the way, and account for food, drinks, tips, transportation and activities (unless those are included in your package). You'll probably also want a souvenir, a spa treatment and maybe a nice bottle of wine one night, so be sure to do all the math before determining which trip is right for you. 9. Use flight aggregators. Websites like Kayak.com and Orbitz.com scan the Web for deals, then send you directly to the airline or booking engine. They're a good place to start your search.10. Be flexible with timing. Check out alternative travel dates surrounding your wedding day, both on the front and the back end. if you marry on a Saturday, you may find that the fares are much higher on Sunday than the following Tuesday.11. Sign up for fare alerts. Websites like AirfareWatchdog.com send you emails with low rates on flights departing from your local airport; the low-fare alert on Travelocity.com will notify you if prices for your route drop.12. Consider low-cost carriers. Smaller airlines like JetBlue, Southwest and Virgin America fly to many of the same destinations as the bigger carriers. What they lack in timetable (they may not fly as frequently or offer service every day), they make up for with fares and flexibility. (For example, Southwest lets each passenger check two bags for free.) Related: 12 Best Honeymoon Destinations for 201313. Book early. When you're going to find the lowest rate is a hotly contested subject, and unfortunately, there's no such thing as a crystal ball for booking times. But there is one rule to live by: if you're going to a popular honeymoon destination in peak season, don't wait for fares to drop -- they're more likely to go up as inventory sells out. You also don't want to miss out on the chance to get the schedule you want.14. Don't expect an upgrade. Years ago, airlines often upgraded newlyweds to first-class as an unofficial perk. Sadly, that's no longer the case; today those privileges go to the most active frequent fliers. That being said, it never hurts to ask at check-in!15. Use your miles. Once you pick your locale and know who flies there, sign up for a credit card that accumulates points. if you accrue enough for a free pair of tickets, you have more to spend on the ground. If you don't accrue enough for free flights, consider trading the points in for an upgrade to business class -- the perfect type of splurge for this ultimate vacay.16. Do thorough research for a hotel room. Check out the rates on Hotels.com and Priceline.com to see the general range of room rates. Then go one step further by pricing out rooms on the hotels' own sites. Some brands offer best-price guarantees you won't want to miss. Many hotels also offer free upgrades for couples marrying on their property.17. Call the hotel directly. When you call the front desk -- rather than an 800-number sales center -- you're more likely to get a person who can offer discounts. Before you get off the phone, have him mark that you're honeymooners in your reservation; some hotels offer perks like a welcome bottle of champagne on an as-available basis, and you want to get your names down first.18. Pick your room category carefully. Compare the prices for rooms with ocean views and amenities like hot tubs and balconies. This isn't any old trip, and you'll likely be willing to pay extra for a memorable experience. Related: 10 Bucket-List Honeymoon Ideas19. Beware of packages. Hotels often offer honeymoon, elopement and romance packages, but they're not always a value. Look at the components and price them out versus a la carte costs or you may end up paying extra for fruit baskets and turndown services you could live without.20. Ask, and you may receive. When you check in, identify yourselves as a wedding or honeymoon couple and ask for an upgrade if you're not given one automatically. If the hotel has suites available, you're more likely to get one than other travelers -- and why shouldn't you?

If you like things a little more high energy, dress to impress for the door at Sway, a Moroccan-themed lounge with lively music.

She was unconscious and was being transferred to the ICU. When I arrived about half an hour later, her condition had deteriorated and she was in cardiogenic shock. This means her heart was so damaged that it could not pump enough blood to keep her body alive. As her daughter and I stood outside her ICU room, and I explained as gently as I could that her mother would probably not survive, her daughter made a comment that I will always remember: ""My mother needed a wife."" When I looked at her quizzically, she continued, ""A wife would have gotten her to the doctor."" She went on to say that she suspected that her mother had had warning signs but ignored them. My patient died the next day, but her daughter's comment had a profound effect on me because she was absolutely right. A wife would not have allowed her husband -- or her brother, or her child or her friend -- to ignore the symptoms. A woman often puts the needs of those she loves before her own. This is true for daily activities and, unfortunately, when it comes to her own health. She may be conscientious about pap smears and mammograms, but heart disease is easy to ignore -- until it hits. That's why the American Heart Association launched Go Red for Women in 2004. It's a grass roots movement designed to teach women about heart health, but it's more than just an awareness campaign. Go Red empowers women to take action. It challenges a woman to ""know her numbers,"" recognize the symptoms of a heart attack or stroke, and make healthy lifestyle changes so that her family members do not have to stand outside of an ICU, hearing the devastating news that I gave that night. We women are all about relationships. That's what makes us such great mothers, spouses, sisters, friends and coworkers. And that's why Go Red for Women connects women with other women -- women who are survivors, women who have lost loved ones, women who have successfully reduced their risk of heart attack or stroke by exercising, eating right, losing weight, and/or controlling blood pressure and cholesterol. Surveys show that almost 90 percent of women who join Go Red for Women make at least one healthy behavior change. That's pretty impressive -- and shows the power of connecting woman to woman. With Valentine's Day just around the corner, it's a fitting time to consider your heart and what you can do to protect this most vital of all organs. Heart disease and stroke kill approximately 400,000 women each year. That's more than the top three cancers combined! Visit GoRedForWomen.org and join the movement. It's easy and it's free. You'll find all kinds of information and, who knows, it just might be lifesaving for you or someone you love. You've probably seen the iconic red dress; it's the symbol of this fight to save women's lives. Wear red and wear it proudly. It signifies your intent to honor your heart. Friday February 1 is National Wear Red Day, and we want to blanket this country in red. You'll see landmarks, stores, news anchors, celebrities and people on the street decked out in red to promote awareness of this devastating, but preventable, disease. So please join the fight. Go Red on February 1 by wearing red, dressing your kids in red, buying red ties for the men in your life and even consider putting red lights in your windows! Do whatever you can to let others know that you care about your heart. Sadly, the scene that I described with my patient happens every minute of every day in hospitals across this country. But together we can change that. So join the movement and... be your own wife. Take care of your heart. Do it for yourself. Do it for those you love and who love you.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post and the American Heart Association in recognition of Wear Red Day, the aim of which is to raise awareness that heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women.

""The helmet has to be worn 24 hours a day and is expensive. Physiotherapy is something you can do at home and easily ... and the pillow is about $25.""Infant head deformities include severe flattening of the back of the head and one side of the face, and heads that are too short.""And sometimes we see heads that are much, much wider than they are long,"" said Wilbrand, whose team's work is published in the Journal of Pediatrics. ""Can you imagine how strange that looks and how hard that would be for a child?""The number of deformities increased from 5 percent during the 1990s to between 20 percent and 30 percent in 2008, according to two recent studies. That increase, researchers believe, was partly triggered by efforts starting in the mid-1990s to curb Sudden Infant Death Syndrome by placing sleeping babies on their backs.Apart from potentially damaging the self-esteem of children, uncorrected head deformities can also affect dental health and delay development of the brain, the study said. Most head deformities do not cause serious long-term physical harm or brain damage, though a small, extremely rare set of deformities can.The German team followed 50 babies five months old and younger with moderate to severe head deformities that posed none of those serious physical or neurological risks. Among the 43 babies the researchers could examine after six weeks, about 18 percent of the stretched babies and 19 percent of the babies using pillows saw improvements in their deformities.While ""laudable,"" the study did not include a group of infants that had neither pillows nor the stretching exercises, so it's difficult to say exactly how effective the strategies are, said Dr. Michael Cunningham, who treats head deformities at Seattle Children's Hospital.Between five and seven months old, ""you often begin to see spontaneous improvement"" in the head shapes of babies, all of whom are born with soft, malleable skulls, Cunningham told Reuters Health.After that, healthy babies become more mobile, raising and lowering their heads more frequently. They're less apt to be in the same position for the extended amounts of time, Cunningham said.As soon as they awaken, babies should be taken off their backs, he said.Curbing the risks of positional head deformities is pretty simple, Cunningham added: ""If you see my eyes, roll me over.""SOURCE: bit.ly/TNddwp Journal of Pediatrics, January 14, 2013.Copyright 2012 Thomson Reuters.

Chinese tourists spent 42 percent more abroad than in 2011, while Russians raised their spending by a third.The result was increased revenues for popular tourist destinations, particularly Hong Kong, the United States and Olympic Games host Britain.Travellers from the austerity-hit euro zone cut spending on foreign travel, however: French tourists trimmed their budgets by 7 percent and Italians spent 2 percent less.The sunny beaches of southern Europe attracted more tourists in 2012, but central and eastern Europe outpaced the popular resorts of Spain and Greece on growth, registering 8 percent more foreign visitors in 2012 against 2 percent for the southern Mediterranean.Further south, Africa rebounded in 2012 to attract 52 million tourists, a recovery after visitor numbers fell in 2012 as travellers concerned by conflicts in North Africa shunned the region. Tourist numbers increased 6 percent in 2012, compared to a 1 percent drop in 2011.While more people visited north and sub-Saharan Africa, three million fewer tourists travelled to the Middle East, the UNWTO noted, ""in spite of the clear recovery in Egypt"".The region registering the biggest increase in visitor numbers was Asia Pacific with 15 million, or 7 percent, more tourists holidaying there. It is expected to register growth of between 5 and 6 percent in 2013.""The sector has shown its capacity to adjust to the changing market conditions....Tourism is thus one of the pillars that should be supported by governments around the world as part of the solution to stimulating economic growth,"" Rifai said.

Separation and divorce,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb45e240000510094c975.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We've all heard of the seven-year itch. Since a popular movie by the same name was released in 1955, the concept of the seven-year itch has been a widely accepted phenomenon. It is based on the belief that many couples start to get antsy and lose interest in their significant others around the seven-year mark.  There's no consensus among experts as to why the seven-year itch may occur. Perhaps it's a matter of timing: after seven years, some couples will have successfully raised one or two children through the trying infant years, only to realize that they don't really want to be together any longer. Or by the seven year mark, some couples may have spent enough time together that the relationship is no longer exciting and all of those pesky habits and traits that were tolerable through the first few years of the relationship are now like nails on a chalkboard (a.k.a. intolerable).  Other theories suggest that our bodies and minds develop and change every seven years. Austrian philosopher and teacher Rudolf Steiner created a theory of human development based on seven-year cycles that were associated with astrology. According to his theories, humans experience changes physically and mentally every seven years. It makes some sense that if we experience large changes in personal growth, experience, knowledge and goals every seven years, that these changes will make a marriage less stable and increase the probability of divorce.But the seven-year itch is certainly not a proven phenomenon. Most experts have simply have agreed to disagree. Four- & Seven-Year Itch? A 1999 study undertaken by Dr. Larry A. Kurdek, a psychology professor from Wright State University demonstrated the validity of both a four- and seven-year itch. The study showed that ""couples often began their unions with high levels of marital quality, but that it appeared to decrease twice: once rather steeply over the first four years and again after about seven"". His study also showed that couples with children experienced a more rapid decline in the quality of their marriage. Twelve-Year Itch? In 2010, a study showed that ""the majority of couples who divorce have now spent more than a decade together before going their separate ways"". The study, which was conducted by the Grant Thornton accountancy group, utilized information from a survey of 90 law firms and concluded that marriages are most likely to fail after about twelve years.Three-Year Itch? Finally, a 2012 study done by parenting website Netmums seemingly refuted all of the previously established ""facts."" The study showed that couples with young children are ""four and a half times more likely to split after three years than the traditional seven years"". Of the 1,500 respondents, 42 percent said that having a child had driven them apart. Siobhan Freegard, founder of Netmums, also attributes this ""itch"" shift to the fact that more couples are getting married later in life, but earlier in their relationships. Women may be reacting to their ticking biological clocks and rushing into marriages and children, rather than spending more time dating and getting to know their spouses to be.What does this mean for couples? Does the the divorce ""itch"" come at three, four, seven or twelve years? In my opinion, the ever-changing conclusions indicate that there is no magic number. The studies do seem to agree that couples need to put in the extra effort every day in order to sustain happy marriages. If a couple doesn't prioritize their relationship, their marriage will fall by the wayside -- no matter how long they've been together."

""..if a man with a penchant for fast-food burgers and Southern cooking could go vegan, surely I could too."" She bought vegan food and tried to change overnight.Tara couldn't, and neither did Bill Clinton. He didn't go from eating greasy hamburgers to vegan meals in one bite. It is too scary and disruptive to our lives to make a huge change at once. What we eat is a reflection of who we are and our family history.   My parents brought their family food traditions with them from Europe. As a young child I ate lots of fatty foods and canned vegetables. We lived across the street from New York City's Henry Street Settlement House where there were nutrition classes for immigrant families. My mother learned about nutrition and changed how she cooked. Her children, grandchildren and even great grandchildren eat fresh salads and snack on fresh fruits and raw vegetables.  If good eating habits are important to you, pick a snack or a meal to begin making changes. You are more likely to actualize it if you share your commitment with others or write it down. Then make a plan to be sure you do serve the healthy snack or meal. There are lots of delicious examples in our book, Funny Food.It may help to select the day you'll shop for the food. Maybe share your healthy food goal with the family so everyone is onboard. If you have children you may want them to shop with you. Pick a snack or meal that they can help prepare. In the process your family will be developing new nutritious habits. Make new family meal rituals and your children will develop traditions that encourage a healthy lifestyle or generations to come.  Start easy and gradually increase the number of meals that are healthy. Weight Watchers reports that if you keep track of what you eat 70% of the time, you will lose weight.

If you want to jump on the bandwagon, that's your business. Although if you do, you're falling into the same trap that he did. You're misunderstanding or trying to fight through your own feelings about something (in this case, Armstrong's actions) -- which is never helpful.By contrast, here's how the Armstrong saga looks to me: Armstrong claimed that, at the time, he didn't feel bad about using performance-enhancing drugs or running roughshod over others to win seven straight Tour de France titles. That's impossible, in my opinion. Feelings don't work that way. Errant behavior (including judging others) is always the result of a person doing something in spite of feelings that are telling him or her, ""You know better!""In other words, I think Armstrong simply didn't (or doesn't) grasp the purpose of feelings. He believed that the off feeling in his gut was a sign to wage war. So he did just that -- and you know the rest.What human beings feel is the up and down nature of our thinking. What we don't feel is the up and down nature of our circumstances. When Armstrong felt insecure -- and we all do at times -- he wasn't feeling his cycling career or those around him. He was feeling his temporarily-insecure thoughts. When he looked outside to explain and fix these feelings through drugs, coercion, or any means, he was bound to find trouble. He was looking in the wrong place.Don't misunderstand; I'm not condoning Armstrong's behavior. I'm explaining it. He's not evil; he's not a terrible guy. In fact, he's no different than you or me. Our feelings are an inborn barometer of whether or not our thinking is productive in the moment. When you work against this inborn barometer, confusion sets in. Act from confusion -- you're toast. Think about it: Are the mistakes you've made in your own life about the situations you encountered, or your feelings and mindset when you encountered the situations? I know the answer.That's why if Armstrong wants to learn from what he did, examining what he did won't help. Rather, he should examine the feeling state from which he acted. The same goes for you and me. All of our sensory experiences come directly from our thinking. And the nature of our thinking is always bound to improve. Unless, that is, we make circumstantial excuses for it.Consider this different take on Armstrong: Based on what he understood to be the source of his feelings, he was actually doing what made sense to him at the time. Armstrong believed he was feeling the world around him. This, alas, is the biggest error a human being can make.And, again, if you're one of those who's taking shots at him these days, you're looking outward to justify your feelings, so you've become a victim of circumstance, too.

(Photo by Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images for Architectural Digest)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc1942000003100fdb384.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The yoga world's in a minor uproar -- again. And once more, it's training its fire on New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist William Broad. The proximate cause is the release of the paperback version of Broad's controversial book, The Science of Yoga, which now includes an extended defense of his thesis that yoga -- as practiced in the West, at least -- can cause life-threatening injuries, including heart attacks and strokes, and that less severe injuries -- from neck and knee sprains to ligament damage -- are still vastly under-reported.But it may be publication of a separate Times article by Broad, coinciding with the paperback's release, that really has some yoga stretch-panties in a wad. In that article, ""Wounded Warrior Pose,"" published last December, Broad had the temerity to suggest that yoga's growing ""feminization"" -- 82 percent of practitioners are women up from 72 percent just four years ago -- could well be due to the fact that men are significantly more likely to get injured in yoga class than their female counterparts are. Men, Broad suggests, may well be opting out of yoga, simply to protect their bodies.As polemical, or unfounded, as that argument might sound, it's amazing that it's raised such hackles. After all, most sensible yogis, once they actually read the hardcover version of The Science of Yoga, ended up embracing the book, realizing that it contained immensely valuable information on the history of the ancient Hindu mind-body discipline, and actually was highly supportive of the yoga movement's claims to offer a unique healing modality. Broad, they realized, simply wanted yoga to accept its faults and imperfections, especially when transposed to the West, and not oversell its goods by pretending that it's always as ""safe as Mother's milk,"" as a prominent Hindu sage once claimed, despite recurring and substantial evidence to the contrary.But the fear among some yogis that Broad is still out to ""get"" yoga with exaggerated -- and now gender-inflected -- war stories about statistically rare injuries has lingered, apparently. And it's true: in his new Afterword, Broad sounds anything but chastened by the original controversy. Indeed, he strongly suggests that not only was he right all along, but that the injury threat is even more severe than he once thought. Broad does rely heavily -- too heavily, perhaps -- on mere extrapolations from annual injury statistics based on hospital emergency room visits compiled by the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission. That's unfortunate, because his original argument wasn't based on statistics alone, but on what yoga teachers and other industry specialists have said in the past about the incidence of injuries and their causes. As I wrote previously, Broad cited some pretty shocking surveys done in recent years, in which veteran yogis not only acknowledged the injury threat but admitted that the industry's own poorly-trained and inexperienced yoga teachers were placing many students at risk.In his Afterword, Broad doesn't recite those surveys. Instead, he sifts through new data, which shows that his earlier estimates, if anything, underestimated the problem substantially (by a factor of 100 or more, perhaps). He also cites numerous letters he's received from long-time yogis and from students who read the hardcover version of the book and either supported his findings with their own anecdotes or simply applauded the balance they felt he was bringing to what has been, heretofore, a largely uncritical reception of yoga in American pop culture and the media.But if Broad thought the controversy was over, he's clearly miscalculated. Dr.Timothy McCall, an internist and self-described yoga therapist who has published several well-received books on the topic -- and whom Broad cited favorably in his book -- has dismissed the Times author's latest writings, saying they confirm that Broad is, indeed, a ""sensationalist.""  McCall -- whose opinions carry as much weight in the insular world of yoga as disgraced American guru John Friend's once did -- says it's clear now that Broad is more interested in drawing attention to himself and in peddling his book than he is in informing the public fairly about the actual risks and rewards of yoga. McCall's written about injuries in yoga, too, but says, without citing any evidence of his own, that the issue comes down to how well students prepare their bodies for yoga and how mindfully they practice. In other words, if there's a problem with injuries, it's certainly not the yoga industry or its agents -- its teachers -- that are to blame. It's the consumer.That's all very convenient, of course, and it's the kind of argument that medical apologists for numerous industries far more health-damaging than yoga typically make. And it should be pointed out that McCall is the ""medical editor"" for Yoga Journal, the leading yoga business trade publication, whose glossy, sexualized, and -- to many yogis -- racially insensitive advertising and highly commercialized upscale portrait of yoga has helped boost the industry's gross sales revenues from a mere $3.1 billion annually in 2004 to a whopping $10.3 billion in 2012. You don't get to become the medical editor of a major trade publication if you're an industry critic, mind you. Indeed, your entire reason for being is to vouch for the industry that's hired you, and when needed, to shoot down or neutralize industry critics -- much like, it would seem, McCall is doing in the case of Broad. And it's not just McCall. Jennilyn Carson, who edits Yoga Dork and has her own cozy relationship with Yoga Journal, has taken up the same cudgel. Carson is well-known for attacking high-profile male yogis like Friend and multi-millionaire Bikram Choudury while serving up puff pieces for her favorite female yoga pop stars, women like Sadie Nardini and Elena Brower, who are largely cut from the same cloth, just nowhere near as successful. She recently highlighted McCall's attack on Broad, echoing his concerns and featuring commentaries from other self-styled experts in the yoga industry, nearly all of whom disparaged Broad's work. Significantly, though, not everyone seems to be biting. One of Carlson's leading yoga blog competitors, Elephant Journal, edited, it might be noted by a man (self-styled Buddhist bon vivant Waylon Lewis), just published a long excerpt from Broad's Afterword, without critical commentary. And even many long-time Yoga Dork readers have risen to Broad's defense, wondering why so many leading yoga voices insist on trying to dismiss him, rather than welcoming his insights and support, along with his criticism, and making some badly-needed reforms. What's it all mean? For one thing, that the stakes in this highly profitable but still fledgling industry are still quite high -- high enough for some of its leading thought-police and hall monitors to try to ride herd on those pesky doubters like Broad who, it's feared, might scare away new consumers with their modest but persistent caveats. And second, that men, especially men with the power to persuade, are, for some yoga women at least, the ""enemy."" And they may well be right. They're the enemy of those that think the only ""good"" science is one that sells -- and the only ""good"" yogis, the ones that sell it."
