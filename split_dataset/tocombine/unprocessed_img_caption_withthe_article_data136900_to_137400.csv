0,TRAVEL,11 Funky Thanksgiving Events That Totally Beat Grandmother's House,Suzy Strutner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thanksgiving-events_us_5b9daae4e4b03a1dcc8b1bfd,"Eat Like a Pilgrim at Thanksgiving Point Faaar from New England, at an educational center between Provo and Salt Lake City",2013-11-20,"PLYMOUTH, MA - SEPTEMBER 19: Costumed interpreters gather around a table loaded with food for the Harvest Feast of 1621, or 'The First Thanksgiving,' at Plimoth Plantation in Plymouth, Mass.

From really realistic reenactments to turkey testicle tastings (EEW!), we've set a spread of Thanksgiving events you haven't been to before.Thanksgiving Weekends at Old Sturbridge Village Thanksgiving festivities are not limited to one day in this Massachusetts living history museum: weekends throughout November offer a smorgasbord of crazy activities, from Thanksgiving sermons in the meetinghouse to shooting competitions with real muskets. Things really ramp up around actual Turkey Day, when you can dine on old-school Thanksgiving food in a tavern or pretend to be a guest at a wedding reenactment. Colored Turkeys at Gozzi's Turkey Farms You can order your Thanksgiving bird from this Connecticut farm, but that's not what visitors come to see. Every year around Thanksgiving, Gozzi's dyes its live turkeys all shades of neon and gives kids a chance to feed them. Says a Yelper, ""I thought pink, purple, green, and yellow turkeys were just in coloring books. But Gozzi's got them."" The Fifth Third Turkey Trot Well, it's actually the 31st installment of this Detroit footrace, named ""Fifth Third"" after the bank that founded it. The titles continue their wonkiness on race day: there's the 10k Turkey Trot, 5k Stuffing Strut, and Mashed Potato Mile (completing more than one is a Drumstick Double). Don your craziest costume, and you might win the contest!McDonald's Thanksgiving Day Parade Macy's is just a bunch of gobbledygook to the 400,000 Chicagoans who take State Street by storm for their own big balloon parade. This year's characters include a huge helium Mr. Potato Head and the Tasmanian Devil... how very traditional. Disney Family Thanksgiving Feast ...sorry, but we had to. Disneyland is, after all, one of the places we're most thankful for. Festive meal options abound in the Happiest Place on Earth. The Disneyland Hotel hosts a feast with traditional fare, and there are special offerings at Fantasyland's Village Haus (think pumpkin pie) and the Blue Bayou Restaurant (we're talkin' stuffing with truffle, chicken liver and fig).Eat Like a Pilgrim at Thanksgiving Point Faaar from New England, at an educational center between Provo and Salt Lake City, local teachers dress up as Thanksgiving's main players to chat with kids at Eat Like a Pilgrim. In a big dining hall with hay-covered floors, there are tug-o-war contests and a buffet of stewed pumpkin and cobbler.Thanksgiving Weekend at Billings Farm & Museum Where better to celebrate Turkey Day than a dairy farm in rural Vermont? At Billings, a horse-drawn wagon clops Thanksgiving visitors around the farm, which is positively brimming with oxen and chickens. Watch dressed-up docents prepare dinner in the historic farmhouse, and peel a few apples with your own two hands. The Turkey Testicle Festival That's right, the catchphrase at this 21-and-over bar fest is ""hot nuts."" A thousand pounds of actual turkey yarbles will be served alongside pizza and beer at Parkside Pub in Huntley, Illinois on the eve of Thanksgiving. Catch some local bands and leave with a story to tell around the Thanksgiving table. Harvest Dinner at Plimoth Plantation Diehard thanksgivers should pilgrimage to where it all began: this living history museum at the original Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts. Tickets go on sale in June for an uber historical dinner experience, and the food is as authentic as it gets. Offerings include ""a pottage of cabbage"" and ""mussels seeth'd in parsley and beer."" The Green Lake Gobble Seattle ends their Thanksgiving 5k with a hefty serving of side dish: in the Mashed Potato Much Off, the one to shovel the most potatoes in four minutes wins a pile of cash. You might also score prizes if you beat the runner who wears a turkey suit during the race.The Virginia Thanksgiving Festival Unbeknownst to many of us, good ol' Captain John Woodlief brought a boat of Englishmen to America in 1619, a full year before the ""real Pilgrims"" hit up Plymouth Rock. Down in Virginia, Woodlief's descendants reenact his landing and subsequent prayer of thanks, which they contend count as the ""real"" first Thanksgiving. There aren't too many hard feelings though-- the Chickahominy Tribal Dancers then invite everyone to gather for ""the friendship dance."" George Dubya has even stopped by before. "

I'm the person who uses Facebook as a world-wide picture sharing site, a 21st century baby brag book. It's me; I've ""ruined"" Facebook for the cool kids.I wasn't always this type of person. In fact, before I turned into me, I used to hate people like me. You know the people I'm talking about: the kind of people who post funny things their kids say (or things they think are funny), share anecdotes from playdates or statistics from doctors' visits; the kind of people who (gasp) use their kids as their profile picture. You're not your child, I would silently fume as I would see yet another one of my friends fall victim to the rampant child-picture-appropriation on Facebook. Your child is not your identity! Your role as a parent doesn't solely define you! I would swear that I would be different -- I would still be ME (as signified by the oh-so-telling Facebook profile picture). And yet, as soon as my baby was born and was big enough to wear a hat with ears -- bam, he was my profile picture. I mean, come on, how could I resist? He was wearing a hat. With ears!So how, after consciously trying not to, did I turn into this person?When you have a child, it's hard not to let your new identity as a mother take over your previous identity as a person. But as a stay-at-home mom, it's even harder to maintain a persona and life of your own. Not only is being a mother who you are, it's what you do. All day, every day. This is not to deride mothers who work outside the home at all. AT ALL. But when you leave your kids and shake off mommy mantle, even if it's just for a few hours, you maintain a separate part of yourself. As a stay-at-home mom, I am immersed in motherhood with very little escape.I don't have co-workers. I don't have a boss (except for my 4-year-old -- ugh, I hate myself for making that joke). I don't have challenges and assignments and goals and meetings. What I have are playdates and art projects and books and park visits. So I document them. And I share.Related: We Need to Quit Telling Lies on FacebookAm I worried about privacy? Of course I am. I know pictures last forever online. I know privacy settings mean nothing. So I make sure not to share anything inappropriate, like naked pictures or penis stories (and like most mothers of boys, I have some hilarious ones). I don't post our address, tag us where we are while we're there or write about a vacation until after we're home.If I'm worried about privacy, why do I bother sharing? I share my pictures because, like every mother on the planet, I think my kids are adorable (no, but really mine *are* adorable). I share because, as pathetic as this sounds, the attention is validation of sorts. I can't get A's anymore -- and forget about being recognized for my achievements (like getting my son to pee before leaving the house -- why is this so hard?!) So what do I have? ""Likes"" and comments about how cute my kids are.I share because my pictures tell stories about our daily lives and our adventures. I share because my pictures create a dialogue with other people. My friends and family live all over the country; I love seeing pictures of my nephews and of friends' kids since I rarely get to see them in person. The pictures allow me to watch them grow up, even if it's only online.And perhaps the biggest answer is that I share pictures of my kids because spending time with them is what I'm doing with my life. When I was in my 20s, I went out a lot, getting drunk and stupid with friends. If Facebook had been around then, those drunken, dancing, ridiculous party pictures are the ones that would litter my page. (Dear Lord and Mark Zuckerberg, I will forever be grateful that Facebook was not around when I was in my 20s). Now, instead of posting pictures from clubs, vacations and brunches, I post pictures from the playground, because that's where I am. It's not always the most exciting life, but it's my life and I'm happy to have a platform to share it.Like this post?

It comes in different forms about all sorts of technology -- portable electronics, e-readers, video games, smartphones and social networking. Here is the short answer: I do not know. But you probably do. Let's explore that idea a little further. The good news: you're asking the question instead of just giving the technology. This is a brilliant sign -- you're parenting with critical thought and consideration. Stepping back is never easy, especially in a culture of get it today, upgrade it tomorrow. Below you will find a list of reminders and insights to help navigate the tech gift rush and prevent tech gift regret. 1. Know this: you don't have to act fast. You have time. Exhale. It is OK to delay technology until you are certain. Even if that means waiting until next year -- or several years. Sometimes the best gift is ""no.""2. Your child will love you just as much and feel just as much joy if you do not make their tech gift dreams come true. You and the splendid spirit of the holidays are enough. Please take a moment and tape that message to your mirror. It is the truth.3. You probably know the answer already. Why? Because you know your child best of all. Go on -- think about it. How are her grades? How social is he? Do they get enough fresh air, play time, and rest? Are you satisfied with their current relationship with technology or are they sneaky, difficult, or distracted by it? 4. Are you willing and able to parent it? That's right. Getting new technology is work for us too. This isn't a give-it-and-go gift. Are you up for the challenge right now? The timing needs to be right for the whole family so we can help our kids build a healthy tech relationship. 5. What's your motivation? I know mine: surprise my teen, show him how ""grown up"" I think he is, build a strong tech foundation with my guidance, and a little thing called a free upgrade. There are zillions of different reasons for different families -- convenience, peers, learning, inevitable, fun -- know yours!6. You gave her sister one when she was 12? That's OK. There is no binding obligation that every moment is fair or equal (that's the best part of parenting!) in your home or in life. Each child is different and has different needs, personalities, tendencies and experiences. 7. Don't be afraid of the technology. And especially don't be afraid to parent it. You do not need to be a texpert to be a good tech parent. See, the way you parent everything else -- respect, responsibility, boundaries, expectations, enjoyment -- should look pretty damn close to how you run your tech rules. Boil it down to that and you are already a master.8. If it doesn't feel right, don't do it. No amount of ""He has it -- she plays it -- I want it"" should influence the way you feel about a game or device or account. This isn't about being controlling or overprotective, it's about knowing what's right for your family. Keep that crystal clear.9. Pssst -- hey you, come closer: You get to change your mind! If you buy something and it doesn't work out -- too soon, too late, too much, not what you thought -- it is not permanent! We get to make mistakes, change the rules, reevaluate, redo. Isn't parenthood beautiful?! Things can be returned, sold, or sit on the top of the refrigerator until the end of time based on your needs. 10. Ask yourself this: How will this make my life and my child's life better? I can say that my son's smartphone coupled with our iRules contract have enhanced our life. For real! Communication with peers, parents and family made simple, expansive access to music and videos, picture taking and sharing, social relationships strengthened. It has been a lovely addition to our life, though it is not -- and never will be -- the epicenter. 11. Never be afraid to pause. There is great wisdom and sweet reward to be gained in the wait. But, if you are ready: purchase with purpose and parent with personal clarity, then your child will have the key to tech success. 12. Know your kid. Trust yourself. Tech is temporary, our guidance is forever. The next big thing will always be there, calling to your kids, and shaking us down. Never doubt the abundant gifts that don't cost a dime. OK, Powerful Holiday Parent. Do what you do best -- open your heart, hold a hand, rock a baby, read a book, sing out loud, embrace. And if it feels right, go on and give that gift.Merry! Happy! Joy!JanellAlso on HuffPost:"

CEO Steve Jobs announces the new iPad as he speaks during an Apple Special Event at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts January 27, 2010 in San Francisco, California. Apple introduced its latest creation, the iPad, a mobile tablet browsing device that is a cross between the iPhone and a MacBook laptop. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9daaf82400003000952ad5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mindfulness and meditation are some of the most popular practices among leaders in fields as disparate as business and the arts. But even before meditation entered the mainstream, a few public figures quietly credited the practice with their greatest ideas and successes. Research has demonstrated that meditation can in fact boost focus and creativity. A 2011 study found meditation to boost both divergent thinking, which helps new ideas to be generated, and convergent thinking, which is linked with effective problem-solving. With more and more research proving meditation's extensive cognitive benefits, increasing numbers of artists, writers, musicians, athletes and business innovators are turning to the practice to tap into their deepest creative potential. “Ideas are like fish,"" the filmmaker David Lynch wrote in ""Catching the Big Fish,"" a book on meditation and creativity. ""If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you’ve got to go deeper. Down deep, the fish are more powerful and more pure.They’re huge and abstract. And they’re very beautiful.” Here are six brilliant ideas and institutions that came about as a result of meditation. Apple's sleek design. Steve Jobs was a practicing Zen Buddhist, and many credit the sleek, minimalist design of Apple products to the tech visionary's Zen philosophy and meditation practice. ""He was a real explorer and very much to be mourned -- and too young at 56,"" Robert Thurman, a professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies at Columbia University, told ABC News. ""We will remember the design simplicity of his products. That simplicity is a Zen idea.""Although Jobs never explicitly said that Zen inspired the design of his products, more than one biographer or friend, including Caleb Melby, who wrote ""The Zen of Steve Jobs"" and Walter Isaacson's ""Steve Jobs"" have suggested a connection between the sleek, simple design of Apple products and Jobs' Zen meditation practice. Zen principles also helped Jobs get in touch with his customers' desires and needs, according to Isaacson. “Instead of relying on market research, he honed his version of empathy -- an intimate intuition about the desires of his customers,"" Isaacson wrote in a Harvard Business Review blog post. ""He developed his appreciation for intuition -- feelings that are based on accumulated experiential wisdom -- while he was studying Buddhism in India as a college dropout.”The Beatles' 'White Album' The Beatles experienced a sort of creative rebirth while on their 1968 pilgrimage to Rishikesh, India, while visiting the ashram of guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The group didn't depart on the best terms with Maharishi (they declared themselves no longer his spiritual disciples, and Lennon wrote ""Sexy Sadie"" as a scathing commentary on Maharishi's alleged sexual advances towards women at the ashram), but all that meditation may have served their music well. Paul McCartney, George Harrison and John Lennon wrote a wealth of songs while in India and immediately following the trip, many of which would later come together in ""The White Album."" ""Whatever shortcomings the Beatles’ interaction with the maharishi may have had, the experience -- which lasted only eight months, from August 1967 to April 1968 -- seems to have opened a floodgate of creativity and got them out of what threatened to be a creative rut,"" the New York Times wrote in 2008. David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" In his book ""Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness and Creativity,"" famed director-turned-Transcendental Meditation guru David Lynch describes how much meditation plays a part in his creative process (he explains meditation as a way to ""dive within"" and ""catch"" those big ideas). Lynch credits many of the best ideas for his critically-acclaimed art house films to his 32-year Transcendental Meditation practice, which helps him to access his deepest creative potential. ""I sat down in a chair at 6:30. And at 7:00, they were all there,"" Lynch told Filmmaker Magazine in 2001 about how he figured out the end of the film. ""They came out of a kind of darkness and made themselves known.""Whole FoodsCEO John Mackey's meditation practice set the foundation for the values that define Whole Foods today. Mackey wrote in his book, ""Conscious Capitalism,"" that meditating helped him to realize his business's highest purpose. ""My search for meaning and purpose led me into the counterculture movement of the late 1960's and 1970's,"" Mackey wrote. ""I studied Eastern philosophy and religion at the time and still practice both yoga and meditation. I studied ecology. I became a vegetarian.""Phil Jackson's Basketball SuccessPhil Jackson, arguably the most successful coach in American professional sports, turned to Zen Buddhism to lead the Chicago Bulls to NBA victory. In a recent interview with Oprah, Jackson said that the driving concept behind his coaching method is the zen principle of ""one breath, one mind."" In addition to teaching his players meditation, Jackson also implemented tactics to boost focus and mental agility like a ""day of silence"" and having his players practice in the dark. ""I approached it with mindfulness,"" Jackson told Oprah. ""As much as we pump iron and we run to build our strength up, we need to build our mental strength up... so we can focus... so we can be in concert with one another.""Leonard Cohen, ""Ten New Songs"" Legendary Canadian musician and poet Leonard Cohen spent much of his early career writing songs that express suffering and angst, reflecting his own struggle with depression and addiction. But later in his life, Cohen experienced a radical change of perspective. ""Cohen had spent the past 50 years ploughing his way through drugs, drink, countless women and several religions in an attempt to find release from this 'backdrop' of self-doubt,"" the Guardian wrote. ""But the cure was more simple -- he learned to ignore himself.""During the late 1990s, Cohen turned his life around by taking up Zen Buddhism, spending time at Mt. Baldy Zen Center, a Rinzai Zen monastery outside Los Angeles. After his stay there, Cohen released the 2001 album Ten New Songs with a distinctly different sound than his previous work. The album went platinum in his native Canada.""In the new album, Ten New Songs, Cohen seems to have reinvented himself,"" wrote The Guardian. ""Gone is the anxiety of the last 50 years, and the one-liners of the past decade. In its place is contentment and a much more considered set of worries.""CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that The Beatles went to India in 1969, when it fact it was 1968. The story has been updated. "
4,FOOD & DRINK,Cooking off the Cuff: The Last of a Giant Cauliflower in a Pasta Dish With Crunch,"Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-the_us_5b9dab79e4b03a1dcc8b2b5c,"Boy, that was one big cauliflower Jackie and I hauled back from the farmers' market a couple of weeks ago.",2013-11-20,Broken-up cauliflower; slivered speck and shallots; big crisp breadcrumbs,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dab772000003100fe0dab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Boy, that was one big cauliflower Jackie and I hauled back from the farmers' market a couple of weeks ago. We ate about 50 percent of it as a gratin -- let's call it cauliflower and cheese; with just bread and butter, it was a more than satisfying dinner. Then another quarter found its way into a second gratin, this one a side-dish that served three people. This left us with plenty more uncooked cauliflower in the fridge. And we let it sit there for a few days before the tail end of a loaf of bread made me think of crispy crumbs: big enough to be really crunchy, but not so big that they'd qualify as croutons.And, while it possesses a lovely and particular texture, cauliflower sometimes benefits from some crunch. So does just about any dish of dried pasta with vegetables, and that intersection determined the fate of the last of the cauliflower. It also determined the way I would cut the vegetable: into small bits that would fit on a spoon leaving room for a piece of pasta and some crumbs.As a base for the condiment (to use Mario Batali's useful word for pasta dressings that are not really sauces), I sweated a couple of sliced shallots in olive oil with some salt and a little chopped rosemary (sage would be lovely too). When they were tender, I added about two tablespoons of slivered speck (prosciutto of any kind would be fine, but speck is what I always keep in the fridge; a vegetarian option would be to double the shallots and cook them until brown) and continued to cook for less than a minute. Meanwhile, I toasted/fried crustless tired baguette broken up in the food processor into about a cup of crumbs that ran from an eighth to a quarter of an inch in size: in a skillet with olive oil and a whole peeled clove of garlic over low heat so that it would get crisp throughout. I set these elements aside and turned to the final quarter of my cauliflower, which I cut and broke by hand into mini-florets; I'd been tempted to break the thing up by whacking it with a mallet, but that would have been as stupid as it sounds.Cauliflower is typically left quite white in the cooking, but some of the great cauliflower dishes (such as Jean-Georges Vongerichten's sea scallops with caramelized cauliflower and caper-raisin emulsion) involve light browning. So did our dinner: I salted it and cooked in a skillet just slicked with olive oil over medium heat. By the time it had begun to brown, it was pretty much cooked, so I turned off the fire and boiled 150 grams -- just over five ounces, plenty for two with all the vegetables and what not - of a pretty pasta shape called Vesuvio: it spirals into a cone, sort of like soft-serve ice cream -- or indeed like a Neapolitan volcano. As it cooked, I rekindled the fire under the skillet and added the shallot-speck mixture to the cauliflower, along with more chopped fresh rosemary (not too much), and when the pasta was done I drained it and stirred it in to the condiment in the skillet, checking for seasoning. Finally, I stirred in the crunchy fragments of bread. If the result had been too dry, I'd have added a little of the salty pasta-cooking water, but the shallots and oil kept everything as lubricated as they needed to be -- and I wanted to keep those breadcrumbs crisp.At the table, we sprinkled a little grated parmesan on a test spoonful of pasta, but it conferred no benefit on an already flavorful dish; if anything, it masked the cauliflower. And that would have defeated the purpose: Remember, this whole enterprise began with a bowling-ball-sized cauliflower.The dish has several kinds of non-sugary sweetnesses: from the shallot, from the ham and even from the cauliflower itself, but it also has a light funkiness from those last two ingredients. Delicious, and worth doing even if you're not stuck with cauliflower you don't have any other plans for."
