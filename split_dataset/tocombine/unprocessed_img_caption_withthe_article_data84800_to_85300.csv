Why, then, in the mid-1800s, were two major resorts built deep in these hills of southern Indiana and less than a mile apart? It was the ""Miracle Waters,"" or what we'd refer to today as mineral or sulfur springs that naturally surface in the area.The French Lick Springs Resort is an enormous, elegantly designed complex comprised of a hotel with more than 400 rooms and suites, a giant conference and events center, casino, and an adult playground featuring golf, horseback riding, tennis, hiking, spa treatments and bowling.It opened in 1845, drawing crowds from as far away as Chicago who wanted to personally draw a cup of the restorative beverage from the well known as Pluto Water. Its popularity grew when the owner became the Democratic National Chairman. He updated the French Renaissance interior with faux marble and Italian mosaic floors, and made room for a railtrack spur with daily train service built by the Monon Railroad between the resort and Chicago.The interior is positively exquisite and unlike anything you've ever seen anywhere in the United States. You really feel as if you've been transported back in time to Europe. The more recent additions of the conference center and casino blend seamlessly from renaissance to modern. There's even a trolley that will take you to the resort's equally exceptional sister property.When it re-opened after a complete redesign due to fires in the early 1900s, the West Baden Springs Hotel was considered the eighth wonder of the world. Its world-class design is connected under a one-of-a-kind domed atrium spanning 200 feet modeled after some of the grandest spas of Europe. And it's a miracle that it still exists today.To give you an idea of its vastness, in its heyday, the property housed multiple mineral springs, an opera house, golf courses, ball fields plus a double decker pony and bicycle track. Oh, and don't forget the hotel's 243 luxury guest rooms and suites. After the stock market crash, it changed hands, becoming a seminary and college before being abandoned by a bankrupt real estate development company for more than a decade.By 1991, the once majestic structure was deteriorating with a section of the exterior wall collapsed, causing Indiana Landmarks, a historic preservation organization, to step in. Funds were collected to stabilize the building and attract new owners. In 2005, COOK Group, Inc., a global medical device manufacturing company based in nearby Bloomington, took over the renovations on both resorts.More than $500 million later, the two resorts are returned to their original splendor, quietly hidden in the restorative hills of southern Indiana.

The 36-year-old stunner attended the Serpentine Gallery party in London on Thursday looking glam as ever. She opted for a sleeveless white top and scandalously high-slit black skirt combo by Louis Vuitton. A pair of nude stiletto pumps finished off the look.The ""Almost Famous"" actress wore her blond locks down in loose waves and kept her makeup quite simple, highlighting her gorgeous complexion. Also in attendance for the night's soiree were Sophie Hunter and Benedict Cumberbatch. The event marked the first appearance for the couple since the birth of their child only three weeks ago. Actress Naomie Harris, who wowed in a hot pink mini dress, was also present.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post misidentified Sophie Hunter as Sophie Turner. "

The difference in Africa is that ""independence"" is an ongoing struggle against a backdrop of powerful foreign interests.Spain is currently exercising the doctrine of universal jurisdiction in a capricious, rapacious, and illegal manner against Rwanda and, by extension, the entire continent of Africa. You won't read much analysis, if anything, about it in the American press. Of course the bare facts about the arrest and detention of Lieutenant General Emmanuel Karenzi Karake, head of Rwanda's National Intelligence and Security Service, are available. On June 20, he was detained at Heathrow Airport at the request of a Spanish magistrate. Released on £1 million bail, Karake must remain in the United Kingdom until an extradition hearing on October 29. The charge? Genocide deniers, operating under the guise of ""human rights groups"" have accused Karenzi Karake of participating in war crimes against Spanish civilians and Hutu perpetrators of the genocide. These alleged crimes took place during and after the time that the Rwandan Patriotic Front liberated Rwanda from the slaughter of up to one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994.The ashes of genocide have been stirred in a painful reminder, and Rwanda is standing alone in the international community with the exception of the African Union, which has strongly condemned the arrest and detention of Karake. Meeting in Addis Ababa Ethiopia, the AU protested the detention of Karake on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by the Spanish judge. In strong language, the AU said it was not only an attack on a Rwandan national, but on Africa as a whole. Listen to what president Paul Kagame said in response to the Spanish attack on African independence and international acquiescence. It is a ""rubbish of injustice,"" Kagame said.Universal jurisdiction is a sinister cousin to the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which allowed European settlers to decimate the indigenous people of the North America. Manifest Destiny ordained that the expansion of the United States was destined to stretch from coast to coast. In a similar manner, the doctrine of universal jurisdiction ""allows states or international organizations to claim criminal jurisdiction over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, and regardless of the accused's nationality, country of residence, or any other relation with the prosecuting entity."" It would seem to be obvious that this arrest is politically motivated. How can any country, let alone the UK, which professes to have a strong relationship with Rwanda, honor an arrest warrant issued by a non-African judge? The AU considers this to be a blatant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Africa and African states. International law is being used as a fig leaf to disguise the growing cancer of genocide denial. In recent years there has been a drumbeat, sanctioned by the United States and the United Nations, against Rwanda. It is reminiscent of the persecution of Israel after it rose from the ashes of the genocide of World War II. Success seems to breed contempt in the international community. Rwanda is the most stable and successful country in central Africa, and has achieved this stature a mere 21 years after a horrific genocide. President Obama and the Department of State seem oblivious to what happened 21 years ago. Obama has cordial phone conversations with President Joseph Kabila in neighboring DRCongo. Meanwhile, the FDLR perpetrators of the 1994 genocide have found a haven in eastern Congo and continue to wreak havoc on the Tutsi population there.As Africa continues to throw off the shackles of European colonialism and emerges as a significant global power, it is remarkable that the African Union is coming together in defense of Rwanda. The United States and the United Nations should stay out of it completely, or at the very least, react in an intelligent and diplomatic manner. Supporting the deniers of genocide is an immoral stance, and should be vigorously condemned by people of good conscience.The timeline of the Spanish indictment is troubling and requires some analysis.On the surface, the storyline goes back to 2008, when Spanish judge Fernando Andreu Merelles issued an indictment against Karake and 39 Rwandan military officers. You can read the indictment and rationale here, and please take the time to do so. Remember, this was issued in 2008 and basically repeats the disingenuous anti-Rwandan Patriotic Front rhetoric of the post genocide years of the 1990's. Genocide deniers offer the claim that it was the Tutsis, in a Machiavellian plot, who orchestrated the genocide against themselves as a pretext to seize power from the Hutus. Readers should take some responsibility and do some critical analysis. Does it make any sense at all for the Tutsis to exterminate their own people? Revisit PBS's excellent ""Ghosts of Rwanda,"" and learn what really happened. Visit Rwanda and help the people guarding the churches and reclaiming the bones of the one million murdered--bones that are still found in tilled fields and reclaimed from old latrines. Go to Rwanda and see for yourselfYou won't find a condemnation of the Spanish indictment in the international press in 2008, but you will find a confidential report on wikileaks that has US diplomats calling out the accusations as ""outrageous and inaccurate."" Summary. The Spanish indictment of 40 Rwandan military officers offers an unrecognizable version of some of the most painful and violent episodes in Rwanda's history, distorting the established record, inventing mass killings, placing the blame for any misfortune Rwandans have suffered (including the 1994 genocide) on the Kagame government. It is a bloated political tract, sloppily organized and endlessly repetitive, and, ultimately, a disservice to those Rwandans who suffered real losses from revenge killings by the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), the armed forces of the Rwandan  Patriotic Front (RPF). End summary.The United Nations' ""groups of experts"" are as believable as the individuals who write the reports. In recent years, the experts have castigated Rwanda, but a 2009 report on the Democratic Republic of Congo offers compelling evidence that the Spanish NGOs who pushed for the indictment of Karake and others were also behind support for the FDLR anti-Tutsi rebels operating in eastern Congo. See paragraphs 112-119 in this document. 112. One case relates to financial support provided to FDLR through funding received by FundaciÛ SíOlivar and Inshuti, both Spanish charitable organizations. On the basis of testimonies, original e-mail correspondence, audio recordings of conversations, telephone log analysis and receipts of money transfers, as well as other documents, the Group established that FDLR has received regular financial, logistical and political support from individuals belonging to the above charitable institutions which, in turn, were funded directly or indirectly from the government of the Balearic Islands, a provincial authority in Spain. Why did this arrest happen now? Karake has traveled to European Union countries many times since 2008. At the time of his arrest he was traveling on a diplomatic passport and on official business. In this day and age ""war crimes"" can be found mostly in the eye of the beholder. British and American soldiers, former presidents Bush, and the Israeli armed forces have been accused of ""war crimes."" The term should be banished until and unless political machinations are removed from international relations.When an activist group learned that Karake was in the UK and alerted Judge Andreu Merelles, the Spanish judge who issued the 2008 indictment wasted no time in issuing a warrant. In an interesting twist, Cherie Booth, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's wife, is on General Karake's defense team. It is good to see the African Union standing up for its member states against former colonialist powers. Louise Mushikiwabo, Rwanda's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, said it best on Twitter: ""Western solidarity in demeaning Africans is unacceptable!! It is an outrage to arrest #Rwanda-n official based on pro-genocidaires lunacy!"""

Louise Mushikiwabo, Rwanda's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, said it best on Twitter: ""Western solidarity in demeaning Africans is unacceptable!! It is an outrage to arrest #Rwanda-n official based on pro-genocidaires lunacy!"""

Politico [Washington, D.C.] 11 June 2015: 5. Print.This ad appropriately cautions against the use of torture, especially those interrogation methods allowed by the executive branch's lawyers to used at Abu Ghraib, which ended up in 459 pages of CIA misconduct journal called The Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Torture. Please purchase a copy of this book and read it before the next election. While I am happy that Human Rights First is running this ad and Senators McCain and Feinstein are doing this, it really begs the issue in a larger way. Approving of torture is like approving of leaves falling from a tree in autumn. It is too easy. The world at large accepts the definition of torture that has been used since the founding of the United Nations. From George Washington to these  Generals and Admirals, the military has always been against torture. The reason for these laws is to protect their own fighters. And that is a good reason indeed. However, the issue is that this ad does not ask and demand by law (yes, law) that those who practice torture need to be judged and punished after a just verdict.Because this ad is from a human rights group, one wonders why the hesitancy about this part of the law. The senators in question will never ask for prosecution of their leaders. So who is left to do that? Really, who is there? Where are the shout, the scream and the outrage against our own torturers? Why not ask for a hearing from the violated? Let their voices be heard. Not in a dinner or some forum with a couple of hundred. No, in front of the senate to show their wounds, their post-traumatic problems, and spell out their disappointment in the US government's allowing these torturers to continue working for them.The ad should be 'Bring the Torturers to Trial"". No new law is needed. Once in the docket for the pain and misery that they inflicted, these torturers should be put into the light of discovery and be judged openly so all Americans can find out what was done in their name and with their tax dollars. A few convictions will go a lot further than this bill, even if it is passed. The Generals in the ad could testify in court on whey they believe torture is not in the interest of the U.S. military brass.If there are no prosecutions of those who gave permission and used torture in the Cheney period, this bill, passed or not, is toothless and not worthy of any large effort. Rewrite the ad to include prosecution for those who approved and performed torture, then let us see who still endorses this ad... it would be interesting. Many of these signers probably know those who agreed with the torturers and their advocates. They might even have seen some these violations. If so, then all the more reason to call for prosecution of the violators.Amos Elon spoke of the loss of hope in his adopted nation of Israel and moved to Italy. I am beginning to think like that once in a while in my own country. Elon stated his point of view in these words ""the pity of it all."" The truth is we have the laws and the definition of torture and we know who did those dastardly deeds, yet we will never use those laws to bring them to court. The USA and its allies call on other nations to do exactly what I am recommending. In fact, it has happened in dozens of nations. Why not the USA? The ad is sweet, but bitter to the innocents who suffered in those stinging jails of ours while persecutors remain free."

Edith Yeung giving a workshop at the Echelon Asia Summit 20151. Acquisition   ""If you don't have enough users, it doesn't matter how you make money.""Edith emphasized how a lot of people don't do enough app store SEO and analytics tools. Everything matters from your keywords to your screenshots that you use. The way people search also varies every day so you have to continually update your keywords and tags. The second thing Edith highlighted was utilizing mobile and web SEO to capture people who could be searching for your application. She gave the example of LinkedIn and how they force you to go to their app when you visit their mobile website.Finally, Edith talked about the power of bloggers and thinking about your target audience.

Retention  ""Push notifications are an awesome way to drive users to come back but it's really all about a well-crafted message that is very specific."" Edith shared how app developers should learn from game developers because game developers are really good in creating these creative seasonal campaigns that get users to come back to the application.Edith also gave the example of Strkingly and how they send her weekly emails telling her how many visits she got during that week. She expounded, ""So automatically, I want my visits to improve so I go back to the application and see how I can improve my views and visits.""Finally, after your users have used your application for a good amount of time, Edith suggested asking them to rate your application on the app store because these ratings do matter. 4.

We are not there yet, but this issue isn't going away.",2015-07-03,2015-07-03-1435937343-3946876-EJ_Report_2015png_FBPostImageActionSprout1200x627.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-07-03-1435937343-3946876-EJ_Report_2015png_FBPostImageActionSprout1200x627-thumb.png," ""Grab that one! Hurry. Hurry!""I was 8 years old running through an orchard with my friends. It was fall, the sun was shining, the apples in the orchard glowed like neon red orbs, the branches strained under their weight seeming to droop down toward us, tempting us further, tempting us sufficiently that we were willing to make a run through the orchard during harvest season, chasing forbidden fruit. ""Duck! Get down."" One of the boys warned.""What?""""I think I saw something."" Tommy was one of the older boys -- 10 years old. And suddenly he was off like a shot, running hard.""Jigaboo on foot!"" He yelled. We all took off.This was the call that the kids made if one of the black orchard workers was nearby -- we scattered, running as far and as fast as we could, shirts formed into bibs, apples bouncing up and down with each stride, all of us smiling, laughing, scurrying to safer quarters. That word was only shocking later. It was not said with animosity -- it was just a fact, a warning, an alarm -- but of what I only understood later.This was farce -- no one ever chased us, no real threat existed, the orchard workers could care less about a dozen apples missing among thousands. But they no doubt cared about the word. Jigaboo. This was my introduction to race in America -- which at 8 years old was a fish's introduction to the water. I remember thinking -- is that ok to say? But none of us talked about it, no one questioned it. It just was. As a middle class white kid, for many years, this is what I thought racism was, a dialogue about figurative black and white -- you said something racist or you didn't, you were a racist or you weren't. And of course that is partially true -- but the far deeper, long-term and devastating acts of racism have little to do with what you say, what names you call someone. They are institutional -- the deliberate construction of a distorted playing field that ensures that if you are black you cannot get a mortgage in a white neighborhood, you will get arrested and convicted for drug use at many times the rate of white drug users, you are more likely to get killed by police while unarmed, the grim list goes on. Through all the racially motivated tragedies of the last several decades and the ones that are coming to the surface, finally, in the last year, including Ferguson and the movement that followed and the terrorist murders in Charleston, NC, we as a nation are on the verge of starting to have a deeper conversation about race. And now, after so many years of pretending issues of race were not right in front of us, race is once again, like so many times in US history, seeming to manifest itself everywhere.Institutional racism in the United States has profound impacts on who lives where, near what, and with how much exposure to risk. This week my organization, ForestEthics, partnered with our ally, Communities for a Better Environment, to release a report in which we analyzed who was at the greatest risk from oil trains in California. The risk in this case is both explosions (there have been five major derailment explosions in 2015 alone,) as well as the longer-term health impacts of diesel fumes and off gassing from these oil trains (they lose 1-3% of volume during transit via toxic gaseous emission).The results are stunning -- dark skinned and poorer communities received not just disproportionate risk, in some cities 100% of the risk from oil trains was borne by lower income people of color (Fremont and San Bernardino), with Oakland, San Jose and Stockton putting over 90% of this risk on these communities. Transporting millions of gallons of oil on mile-long trains through our cities, towns, alongside our water supplies, and through our forests is a kind of insanity. Doing all of this while saddling dark skinned and poor communities with most, or in some cases, all of the risk, is morally repugnant. It is time to ban oil trains. If they can't haul this explosive, toxic crude safely, they shouldn't haul it at all. And those that do -- Warren Buffett and his BNSF railroad primarily -- should confront the choice they are making and who they have chosen to put at risk.Our country is almost daily confronted with a ghost from its past, whether it's the legacy and current practice of police violence, the Confederate flag inspired killings of black parishioners and their Pastor, the racist remarks of a presidential candidate... and we will see what is in the news tomorrow. Now we can add oil trains and who is threatened the most by explosions and pollution to the list.Little by little, we are getting closer to a deeper conversation about race -- and what we can do to correct our ugly history so that the actions of the future are not continuously bound by the racist policies and practices of the past. We are not there yet, but this issue isn't going away. It will keep reappearing in different forms -- we are like the fish that can't quite see the water it's swimming in, but little by little we are getting the feeling that there is a pervasive injustice tainting the environment around us. It is our job to make sure the water that some future generation is born into isn't poison.Read the ReportPS: I want to thank angel Kyodo williams (@ZenChangeAngel) for her leadership and guidance with this piece.

As they tried to line up with the runway for landing, dangerous crosswinds hit the airplane and the storm changed directions fast several times. The crew and passengers realized they were in serious danger. The pilots decided to land by making a visual approach but heavy rain and dark clouds obscured the runway. Visibility fell drastically as the plane descended. Finally, the plane hit the tarmac violently. Traveling at over 100 MPH, the aircraft ran off the end of the runway and slammed into a steel walkway. The plane was ripped into pieces. Ten passengers died in the crash, including the captain. The passengers who were still alive struggled to get out before the plane was engulfed by fire. The deeper investigators looked, the more they found extraordinary evidence that flying into thunderstorms was a widely spread habit throughout the entire industry. Experts from NASA and MIT studied the behavior of pilots during landing. The researchers wanted to see when pilots will fly into thunderstorms. [Technical report]""Pilots know that if we go into that thunderstorm  we may not come out alive"" - Greg Faith, NTSB Chief Investigator for National GeographicInvestigators studied a total of two thousand airplanes that flew into severe thunderstorms. The results are mind-blowing: two out of three pilots (66% of pilots) flew and landed in thunderstorms. The study reveals that pilots exhibited more recklessness when the pilot in front of them also landed in bad weather.  ""It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble, is what you know for sure that just ain't so"" - (Probably) Mark Twain Sheeping is mindlessly following the others when you actually know the right actions and behaviors but don't want to assume responsibility for them. Many times we take our cue from people around us. We unconsciously determine the right actions based on what the others are doing. Sheeping (the technical term is social proof) is especially critical in moments of uncertainty. When we are not sure what we have to do and what is the right behavior, we automatically and unconsciously look for evidence around us: How are the people around us behaving? We automatically assume that they must know something we don't and follow them. Unfortunately, most of the times they don't know any better and they also look around for social evidence in us. And thus sheeping expands. ""Sheeping is mindlessly following the others when you actually know the right actions and behaviors but don't want to assume responsibility for them"" - Dr. DragosObviously, when you have an idea, when you want to do extraordinary with your life there is a lot of uncertainty. Very likely you are not sure what is the next right action. If you take bold leadership for your life, you need to be contrarian. Listen to your gut feeling and don't rationalize your intuition away. Because It's never the extraordinary people who do the extraordinary. It's the ordinary people like you and me who decide to step out, get up off their knees and take the journey. Because they complete the journey, ordinary people like you become extraordinary. Beware, the sheep are watching over your mind. Be contrarian. Your friend, Dr. DragosPS: Can you think of other situations in which sheeping is harmful? Maybe when you decide to smoke because your colleagues smoke. When you drink more because others drink more? When you have meetings and know what the reality is and nobody is doing anything? When hundreds of people are stepping over a person lying unconscious in the metro station? Leave a comment and let me know."

Omega: Your home -- which you define as ""the thing you love more than you love yourself"" -- has always been writing. But after your (now husband) faced deportation and you lived together in exile abroad, home gathered a different meaning. What does ""home"" mean today?Elizabeth: I'm so inconsistent, I just sold that house that I wrote Signature of All Things in and my husband and I are about to sell the buildings that we have in Frenchtown. The only thing I'm longing for right now is to not own anything or belong to anything.It was a phase that I went through where I really needed to feel grounded, where we just felt we needed a house and a garden and a community and neighbors and that was such a balm. And especially after Eat, Pray, Love, it was really nice to be in a small community where people were really protective of us. It just felt very centering to be part of that. And now I'm sort of back to, ""Where are we going to go?""We moved to a smaller house and we'll stay in town but we're just spending less time here. I'm coming back into some other older version of myself maybe. We have so many selves in our life. I've been lucky enough to be able to honor each self as it unfolds and let it go when it's done. It's time to come into the next self, I think.Omega: The Signature of All Things, was the first book you ever wrote at home. Where did you write Big Magic?Elizabeth: I wrote Big Magic in a bunch of hotel rooms because I was on the road so much last year, with the Oprah Winfrey tour. It was the opposite experience of writing Signature of All Things. It's a faster book, a self-help book. The language is as big a tent as I can build, I don't want to leave anyone out. I wanted to say all the stuff in the simplest possible manner. So in a way it was suitable to write in airports, I was able to write it from a lighter place. Omega: Before Eat, Pray, Love, you were a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award and recipient of a Pushcart Prize and a National Book Award. As a ""serious writer"" you tried to ""make a man out"" of yourself. You ""came out"" as a woman in your memoirs -- which were labeled ""chick lit."" Why do you think there is derision of women's stories, even as women make up the largest reading population?Elizabeth: I feel like it's the last gasp -- not even the last gasp -- the post-dead gasp of the patriarchy. I don't get outraged about [the label] because I think it's such a waste of my energy. Managing what the world thinks of me is such an impossible task, it's hard enough to manage what I think of me, so I will leave everyone else to manage their own thoughts about me.I have outrage fatigue, which does not mean that there aren't things in the world to be outraged about but just that outrage is very powerful fuel and I really save it these days for certain battles. Jesse Jackson once said, ""The only defense against racism is excellence, the only defense against sexism is excellence.""It's not a battle that I'm fighting in any way other than to just continually follow my own mandate which is you are here to be a writer, you're here to do the most excellent work that you can possibly do in the most honorable way and whatever happens next is none of your business. And eventually if you and all women continue to do excellent work on whatever moves us then those barriers will just continue to drop as they have done for a long time and those conversations won't happen anymore.Omega: What are you reading right now? What are you excited about reading next?Elizabeth: Right now I am reading a book that to my shame I had never read before, it's E.M. Forster's A Passage to India. It is so good. I want everyone to know about this book.""Here's my hot new tip everybody, there's this up-and-coming young British writer named E.M. Forster who I think is really going to set the world on fire.""I would love to promote a more contemporary book as well. Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel -- that's probably the one that's been keeping me up late -- was a nominee for the National Book Award. I have to get going on research for the novel that I put aside to write Big Magic about the New York City theater world in the 1940s. I want to write about women's promiscuity, a subject I'm really interested in, in a way that they are not shamed or destroyed -- a refreshing take. Although there have to be consequences of course, there is no action without reaction, especially in an era before readily available birth control or women's rights. The consequences of women's sexuality are much more serious than the consequences of men's sexuality, generally. But I also want them to have a good time. So I'm trying to figure out how to handle that all!Explore more in the category of Creative Expression.© 2015 Omega Institute for Holistic Studies, Inc. All rights reserved."

Here's how the Tools can help with that part of you--often referred to as the saboteur, the shadow, or your inner enemy--that Michels and Stutz call Part X.Omega: You describe how people can use the Tools to do battle with Part X, also known as their inner enemy. Does there come a time in using the Tools where it feels less like a battle and more peaceful?Phil: I have a saying that peace is an active state of mind. We're trying to combine the sense of peace with the necessity for constant work. Peace was often defined as something languid and laid back, a state where you can fold your tent up, stop making an effort, and stop being vigilant. That's not what peace is.The only infinite thing about a human being is their ability to keep on struggling with no end point. If you're willing to do that, you've tapped into an infinite part of yourself that can then connect to the infinite forces in the universe, and that is peace. As far as I'm concerned that's the only peace. That's why I say peace is an active state of mind. Barry: I like to illustrate this with a triangle. The lower part of the triangle is an eternal battle between you and this inner saboteur. If you engage in the struggle and keep fighting it, what happens is the top of the triangle emerges and at the top of the triangle is your higher self. It's a part of you that transcends the lower level and can view the struggle from a higher perspective and be at peace with it. These two levels happen simultaneously, the struggle and feeling integrated and completely at peace.Omega: How can you be sure Part X hasn't taken over the Tools and is using them for its own end, like posing as your Inner Authority?Barry: Part X doesn't want you to use tools at all. Its first strategy is to get you to forget them entirely. In my case, I was always amazed at how I could work all day with patients, exhorting them to use the tools, and then somehow ""forget"" to use them when I went home at night.Once you come up with ways to remind yourself to use the tools, Part X still discourages you from using them. When you use them and you get a good outcome, it suggests you no longer need them. When you experience a failure or setback, it tells you they didn't ""work,"" so there's no point in using them.If all else fails, it likes to pose as a powerful inner authority who knows you better than you know yourself. If you study it carefully, you'll notice it uses a harsh, finger-pointing, punitive, judgmental tone. When we work with people, we try to shift that tone to one that is supportive of every effort you make -- whether you succeed or fail.Phil: If the voice inside you is telling you to quit, it's almost definitely Part X. It's either going to tell you that you don't need to do it anymore, that you've got this solved, or you don't have to make anymore effort because you or the situation is hopeless and helpless, so why bother.Omega: Is it easy to learn how to use the Tools if you're not used to being self-reflective or self-aware?Phil: I try to focus on what someone wants to change and just bang on that over and over again. I try to give as little theory as I can and instead give them tasks that include what I like to call student study -- I ask them to study themselves. I also get people to draw pictures. When I ask people to draw a picture of Part X, no one has ever said, ""What the hell is that?""Omega: What's the biggest thing to watch out for with Part X?Phil: There seem to be three basic rules in the universe: part of life is pain; part of life is uncertainty; and part of life is endless work. And none of these ever go away. What we see in almost everyone is the idea of a realm of illusion where you will be exonerated, or exempt from these three rules of the universe. I call this the ""snapshot realm,"" because we have a picture of this perfect place in our mind, but this place doesn't exist. Part X wants you to believe that this illusory realm is real, and once it does it can pretty much have its way with you because it's making you a false promise. Barry: An example of the realm of illusion might be romantic relationships. Most young people go into romantic relationships expecting to walk hand-in-hand into the sunset with the music swelling. People expect this moment to last forever. But that's Part X's demonic way of inflating someone's expectations to a point where they will inevitably be crushed. It's like commercials for exercise equipment that tell you you're going to lose weight just by buying a treadmill but don't mention that you're going to have to get yourself to use the treadmill.

17,FIFTY,10 Things Midlifers Should Know About Today's Workplace,Ann Brenoff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/midlifers-office-environment_n_7613198.html,,2015-07-02,"403080 01: Job seekers search for employment on computer terminals at the Hellowork employment agency March 29, 2002 in Tokyo, Japan. Japan's unemployment rate held at 5.3 percent in February, unchanged from January, but the job market remains hampered by declining spending and corporate cost cuts. (Photo by Koichi Kamoshida/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb674c02100000002c8b60c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With apologies to that old Oldsmobile ad slogan, it's not your father's office anymore. Things have changed radically in the workplace and here are 10 things midlifers need to know about the new office protocols.1. Knock before entering a cubicle. Many of your co-workers will don headphones to drown out the noise around them. Such is life in an open-plan office. But the earphones cause another problem: They don't hear you coming. Try to approach them by walking up to them in their sight line, not sneaking up from behind. Nobody likes to be startled. Even better, send them a Gchat or text asking if this is a good time to talk before you stop by.2. Headphones are today's ""Do Not Disturb"" sign; heed them accordingly. Respect your coworkers who are wearing them. It generally means they don't want to be disturbed. Conversely, it is considered bad form to wear headphones in the elevator, the public kitchen or at meetings. To do so sends the message that you are unfriendly. 3. Work travel is less frequent. Meetings today are frequently handled by teleconferencing or videoconferencing. In-person meetings happen, but rarely. Why? It's cheaper. During the Great Recession, technology turned physical meetings into virtual events and saved companies 50 percent to 80 percent, reported Bloomberg. So don't expect your frequent flyer program to grow off of your business travel. 4. Face-time with the boss will also be less frequent. When you want to ""talk,"" you may be expected to use Gchat. In-person talks are generally reserved to deliver bad news. So with that in mind, be grateful that no one wants to see you.5. ""Has a texting relationship"" is the new ""eats lunch out with the boss every day."" It means that an employee and the boss are chummy and have a friendship that extends outside the office. As for the actual eating lunch part, nobody really does that -- with the boss or with anyone else for that matter. Lunches are generally eaten on-site -- or at your desk. It's a work culture thing.6. Take that phone call elsewhere. It used to be that we'd answer our desk phones at, well, our desks. This rarely happens anymore -- even at companies that still have land lines and not all do. If your cell rings in today's office, answer it and head toward the nearest empty conference room or phone room. Our offices tend to be quieter these days and besides disturbing your coworkers, do you really want them all to be privy to your business?7. Emails don't need to be answered outside the work day. A boss or coworker might send you a work-related email at 11 p.m. just to get it off her plate. But you really don't need to respond to it as soon as it lands. But yes, you will answer it. Why? Our 24/7 connectivity makes us feel like we should when we really shouldn't. By the way, there are various email schedulers that can be introduced in the office that delay delivery of a missive until you are back on the clock. Maybe at your next face-to-face meeting with the boss you can suggest it?8. Office snacks are meant to be eaten at the office and not intended to be served at your next party. While it's certainly within the norm to grab a drink or bag of chips on your way out the door, don't abuse your company's generosity. The company is trying to make your work environment more comfortable, not help you reduce your weekly grocery bills.9. Facebook is for friends. Twitter is for everyone. If you are genuinely friends with your co-workers, by all means friend them on Facebook. But if you aren't, why would you? It's important to maintain lines between your work life and personal life. Technology and social media make it easy to blur those lines. You don't really want to see the boss in his bathing suit, do you?10. Pet-friendly offices are pretty commonplace. There is plenty of evidence that pet-friendly offices are a growing trend. According to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, 20 percent of U.S. companies have adopted pet-friendly policies. Allowing fur-babies into the workplace is a morale and productivity booster. But if Scout comes to work with you, better make sure he also understands the new office protocols. We'd hate to see him expecting face-time with the boss. Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter | "

Dowlin, ContributorMusician",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-hypocrisy-of-religious-freedom_b_7663824.html,"It's not freedom when you are advocating taking away the liberty and rights of other human beings. It is not religious, especially not ""Christian,"" to be intolerant and bigoted against your fellow citizens.",2015-07-02,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA- JUNE 28: Paulo Torres, left, dances with his husband, Victor Tsang, right, after the San Francisco Gay Pride Parade, June 28, 2015 in San Francisco, California.

It is not religious, especially not ""Christian,"" to be intolerant and bigoted against your fellow citizens.And while I admire Kirsten Powers for being a reasonable and at times progressive voice at Fox News (and calling out Bill O'Reilly on his show for his stance about racism not being a substantial problem in our society), I have to disagree with her premise in her recent book, The Silencing: How the Left is Killing Free Speech. We are not killing free speech, only calling out hate speech.As a member of the LGBT community, I can say we are not silencing the religious right, but standing up for our own God-given rights. Having grown up a gay American in the 1950s and '60s, I can tell you that silencing is what was done to us in those decades. It has been said that ""a child should be seen and not heard."" We were taught to be neither. We lived in the shadows, hiding our imposed societal shame, leading secret lives that we hoped no one would find out about.Looking back, I forgive myself for not being more open and true to myself. I was bombarded by school, friends, family and my Baptist church with a silent, deadly belief that who I was deep down inside was sinful and perverse.After all, as Brian McNaught so deftly points out in his book, Growing Up Gay and Lesbian, we didn't have any role models to look up to then. Ellen hadn't come out yet. It was before Stonewall. There were no gay characters in the movies, or if there were they were portrayed as losers. They first gay film I remembered watching on TV as a teen was 1961's ""The Children's Hour."" Based on the play by Lillian Hellman, it starred Shirley McClaine and Audrey Hepburn as friends who owned and ran an all-girls' boarding school. One of the residents started a rumor that Audrey and Shirley were intimately involved and it ruined them and their reputations and forced the school to close. Turns out that Shirley's character really was a lesbian and she ended up committing suicide in the end. Although, this film touched me deeply inside (I think seeing a woman profess her romantic feelings of love to another woman stirred something in me), it was hardly a movie that would make one want to come out of the closet. As McNaught points out in his book, we had no one to turn to discuss our attractions growing up. Not the school teachers nor administrators, not the Church leaders, not even our own parents. If a child of a different race or ethnicity got bullied they could go to their parents for sympathy. But if a gay kid did that the parent might ask: ""Why were you called a queer?"" And they may not really want to hear the answer to that.Indeed, there is an old joke that goes: ""Which is easier, being black or being gay? Black, because you don't have to tell your parents.""As for racial relations in the '50s and '60s, there was a term called ""separate but equal."" Problem was it was segregation with inequality. But at that time, African Americans had an identity. They had separate bathrooms, movies, radio programs, TV shows, music, Negro baseball league, and Armed Forces battalions. They had their own culture and still do to this day. Homosexuals were invisible.I remember certain clues I was given growing up that were meant to guide me into a ""normal"" heterosexual lifestyle. When I was in the fifth grade, I shared with my mom that I really liked a fourth grade girl who was a piano prodigy. She gently reminded me ""you mean you admire her.""When I was around twelve years old I had a best friend from the church that I hung around with at the community pool. Driving home with my whole family in the car, my older sister said ""I couldn't believe Joan and Courtney were holding hands at the pool."" This shocked me because for the first time I had to question an innocent gesture of affection I showed to a close friend.My dad used to tell us he always considered homosexuals deviants who would were looked down upon in the military. Happily, my parents and siblings evolved on the issue and continued to love me when I came out to them at the age of 29. I know other gays were not as lucky as me in that regard.I knew no gays in high school (this was before the gay/straight alliances), nor college, nor even graduate school.As McNaught writes, back in the day, you couldn't even go to the library and find any books on Homosexuality (this was before the Internet.)And the Baptist Church, though I loved the people and the Pastor there, scared me the most into staying in the closet. I remember in a pre-teen Sunday School class we were given a booklet that described homosexuality as an addiction or disease. There were pictures of deformed couples holding hands and the pamphlet said that most homosexuals do not want to be that way and presented it as a choice. Basically, I was taught by the church that it was a crime against God and nature.I was creeped out by the whole thing and the indoctrination worked as I decided then and there I didn't want to go down that path even though I really liked the piano prodigy and loved my friend from church and had a crush on my gym teacher in Junior High school. I didn't want to go to Hell.In essence, I stuffed my emotions and attractions and tried to fit in. I dated guys but had enough sense to never get married even when presented with an engagement ring. I drank too much in college, I think because I was so conflicted and finally came out to myself after I moved to California (for a music gig in the San Jose Symphony) in the late '70s.It was easier to declare being gay in California than the East coast in those days. It is remarkable how the country has changed through the years and now gay marriage is a reality in many states and may soon be legal in the nation.I believe the Internet and TV and movies and the current administration have influenced this new generation to come out with pride. Intolerance is quickly becoming passé and that's a good thing.But we must not forget our history and the sacrifices my generation made to allow this to happen. Stonewall, the gay rights movement, Harvey Milk, PFLAG, and the fight against AIDS and DADT and DOMA all contributed to lay the foundation for our finally being given our basic human rights.Some in the religious right want to cling to ""traditional"" values and view our liberation as an abomination. Unfortunately, that is the same thinking I was indoctrinated into as a young teen in my Baptist church. Apparently, not all have evolved on the issue. I say we will no longer be shamed or silenced.Coming out to me was a mental, physical, and yes, spiritual process. For a number of years in the late '90s, I was a member of a Metropolitan Community church that was founded for LGBT folks and their straight allies. It brought me back to my faith and made me realize that I am gay by God. And no so-called ""Religious Freedom"" can take that away from me. Our ancestors escaped persecution to achieve true religious freedom in the new world. This included the right to worship and I do not see the gay movement as taking this away from anyone.Rather, LGBT people want what past generations came to this country for: the right to marry, have and adopt children, worship as we please, serve in the military, equal job opportunities, protection from persecution in the workplace, and the pursuit of happiness. The genie is out of the bottle and we can never go back to being invisible again."

Why should they have to do that? So quickly?My visceral response gave way to self-examination. Maybe, like the Amish families who lost their children to a shooter a few years ago, the family members of those who died at Mother Emanuel are better Christians than I am, with a deeper faith, a less questioning theology, a more profound relationship with God.I came close to writing something about that soon temporary conclusion. Then I started reading essays and blog posts by African-Americans on the subject of shame and forgiveness and the trap created for the black church simply by the attempt to survive in a majority white world. Wherever I read the ensuing conversations, the majority white participants, and particularly the Christian ones, resist the idea that there is anything multi-layered about the forgiveness offered by the families of the victims of the massacre in Charleston last week. They remind me that forgiveness is about letting go of things so you won't be burdened by them, a psycho-spiritual approach popularized by Lewis Smedes in his book Forgive and Forget, a book I have recommended and handed along to many people.One of the things on my mind is how disconnected our experiences as white people can be from those of others. I think it's harder to ask people to apply that to massive, longstanding cultural wrongs.And for white liberals of a certain age, this is a horrible time of reckoning as they -- well, honestly, we -- realize the dreams we had for a better more equal world, and the work they or their parents did in the 1950s and 60s was a drop in the bucket. I'm a little younger and better in tune with wider conversations about race, yet I am still having to tell the voice in my head that says ""But really, things are better!"" to shut up.It's not just that there is still a ways to go. It's that we congratulated ourselves for making the three-point turn to get out of the driveway and never went further, and now we've backed down the street into eroding the Voting Rights Act and allowing police brutality instead of putting the car in Drive and actually making a difference.We have been in denial, and especially for those of us who came up through religious communities, and maybe even had relationships with churches of not primarily the same racial makeup, or glad-handed or even genuinely welcomed the non-white visitors who stopped into our churches, we're finally looking at how much more needs to be done. It's uncomfortable, and we resist it, and we can't figure out how to be allies and thought we already were. No excuses, just noting that there is a lot of reckoning occurring here.I hate like hell that it took a shooting in a church to bring us to this moment -- both because I hate that it happened in a church, and because I hate that putting the spotlight on ""respectable"" victims makes it more likely that white people will have to face the truth. It seems like we have had plenty of chances already.And this is not the problem of our friends in the black church or in the more secular anti-racism movement. This is *our* problem. We need to listen and hear the truth and figure out how we are going to help make the change. We are complicit in it, and we need to suck up our disappointment, listen to other people's stories, and stop telling them they are wrong about the White church simply because we've never seen anyone be discriminatory or spoken or heard anything terrible from our own pulpits.I don't want to hear that I am forgiven for these things; I flinch at the notion, although I need forgiveness for the ways I am part of the problem.Let me, let us, sort that out with God. And Lord, my Lord, help me to see the ways I can make a difference."

22,QUEER VOICES,WATCH: The Best and Worst Parts of the Supreme Court Marriage Ruling,"Matt Baume, ContributorWriter, photographer, explainer of the strange and wonderful",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/watch-the-best-and-worst-parts-of-the-supreme-court-ruling_b_7677412.html,June is the anniversary of the ruling that overturned the federal marriage ban and the ruling that ended the criminalization of homosexuality. All of these cases were written by Justice Anthony Kennedy.,2015-07-02,"Gay rights advocates John Lewis, left, and his spouse Stuart Gaffney, with the group Marriage Equality USA, kiss across the street from City Hall in San Francisco, Friday, June 26, 2015, following a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that same-sex couples have the right to marry nationwide. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafde27260000360081649b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's been less than 50 years since the Stonewall riots and the foundation of the modern LGBT liberation movement. And here we are, with marriage equality newly-recognized from coast to coast. It's amazing.But June isn't just the anniversary of Stonewall. It's the anniversary of the ruling that overturned the federal marriage ban, and the ruling that ended the criminalization of homosexuality. And it's close to the anniversary the ruling that for the first time extended equal protection to LGBTs.All of those cases were written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. And now, he's given us a decision that establishes the freedom to marry as a fundamental right. Five justices agreed with Kennedy, and four disagreed for various reasons that really do not hold up. Let's take a look at how Kennedy's decision works, and then talk about why the dissent is so wrong.Kennedy's ruling is based on four ideas: freedom includes the freedom to choose who you marry, marriage is vital for relationships, marriage protects kids and families and marriage is a cornerstone of American society. Central to Kennedy's ruling is this:The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.In other words, the Constitution's set up so that as we become a more enlightened society, we can improve our own laws to reflect that enlightenment.Ultimately, Kennedy wrote,Marriage allows two people to find a life that could not be found alone, for a marriage becomes greater than just the two persons. Rising from the most basic human needs, marriage is essential to our most profound hopes and aspirations. The Constitution grants ... that right.Five justices agreed, four didn't.Essentially, the dissenters believe that marriage isn't a fundamental right, or that it is for everyone except same-sex couples, which is very convenient.Roberts calls marriage bans a ""decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history,"" and an ""unvarying social institution enduring over all of recorded history.""Well, that's just wrong. As we know, marriage has varied a lot. Virtually nothing about marriage has persisted throughout every culture. It is in a state of constant change and, though gradual, improvement.Thomas has what may be the strangest dissent. He says that human dignity is innate and can't be granted or taken away by the government. And here's where he goes with that:Human dignity cannot be taken away by the government. Slaves did not lose their dignity ... because the government allowed them to be enslaved. Those held in internment camps did not lose their dignity because the government confined them. And those denied governmental benefits certainly do not lose their dignity...Did Thomas just mean to defend slavery? Probably not, but he also probably didn't mean to suggest that banning marriage is similar to slavery and internment.What he means, is that if you only acknowledge the personal, internal aspect of dignity, then yeah, no one can take that away. But dignity has external qualities as well. Slaves were definitely deprived of something, for example their freedom and very recognition of their humanity. And it seems like some amount of dignity would go along with that.Roberts, meanwhile, admits that marriage changes, writing ""the 'history of marriage is one of both continuity and change,' but the core meaning of marriage has endured.""And there's the fundamental disagreement. The core meaning of marriage. Is it, as Kennedy says, an embodiment of ""the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family""? Or, is it as Alito says, ""the one thing that only an opposite-sex couple can do: procreate.""I don't know. Between those two -- love fidelity devotion sacrifice and family, or procreate -- which sounds more like a wedding vow to you?"

The Supreme Court declared Friday that same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in the United States. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafde263c000032000ba8ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A quick scan of the cable news channels or the Twittersphere shows clearly that the recent Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage has drawn sharp feelings from both sides of the issue. Most of these reactions were easily predictable. People across all media are exhibiting their feelings loudly, as the issue touches on so many potent areas of life: the political, the ethical, the moral, the religious.But as I sift through my own feelings, I find I have a different reaction than those that seem to be most loudly expressed. I am a therapist, and I see this issue through the lens of emotion. And homosexuality and gay marriage are highly emotional issues. And we therapists possess the privilege of a unique perspective on the emotional elements of most any issue. And the emotional elements are crucial in understanding the issue overall.For I have sat across from the young man fighting against his truth, his gay-ness, with every fiber of his being. Because it will disappoint his parents. Because he won't be accepted or loved, but rejected. Because he has been taught that who he knows himself to be is wrong. So he fights. He fights against his very nature. The resulting anxiety and depression run so very deep.I have sat across from the teenage girl who recognizes who she is, but loathes the fact of it, and loathes herself as a result. Because it makes her life so hard, so odd, so weird. It estranges from people she once considered safe. Thoughts of suicide hover in the shadows all around her. And yet in every conceivable way, she is better-than-fine: bright, driven, beautiful, athletic, funny. And gay.And I have sat across from the man who has lived a lie his entire life, hiding beneath the trappings of 'normalcy': wife, children, house, couple of dogs. Family man. But he is tortured nonetheless. For he is gay as well, and he and those around him, he projects, would find this to be unacceptable. And now an entire family is drawn into the dark.Unfortunately, I could share countless other stories, all sharing this theme: to be gay, to be attracted to someone, to love them organically, is not just unacceptable, but shameful. Shameful.With just a moment's reflection, we all know that the forced constriction of anything authentic and genuine in ourselves will prove to be incalculably damaging. We should live in a place where one's truth carries not a hint of shame, but joy. Only joy.And everyone, every single one of us, deserves that feeling.So this ruling suggests another wave in a sea change. For many people, many of my own clients in fact, can now comfort themselves with the fact that what they sense and know about themselves, this undeniable core essence of their being, is now lawful and allowable and acceptable by society's standards. And sure, that's good. But it goes beyond just that, right? Because for the majority of us, our loves and attractions are actually celebrated, from crushes to dates to proms to weddings. And we don't really need to give it a thought. There is a wild emotional divide between private shame and public celebration, and it is critical.I like to think that a generation from now, if our sons or daughters are drawn to someone, male or female, and fall in love with that someone, that we will want to share in the joy that love will bring to their lives, and to our own. Making ourselves unavailable to that joy ensures, and has ensured, the opposite: fear and judgment and ego, enough to keep therapists like me flush with clients for generations, treating toxic, wholly unnecessary feelings of shame and depression and relentless anxiety about something that is organic and authentic and actually quite simple.This Supreme Court ruling is another step toward the openness we need as a society, openness that will undoubtedly have strong legs. Fewer pills will be popped to numb unnecessary pain. Fewer people will be compelled to live a lie their entire lives. Fewer people will feel a need to shield their deep reality in shame. Fewer lives will end tragically. This is no small deal.So I celebrate today, for the emotional well-being of every gay person, man or woman, who has suffered their love in lieu of celebration. I celebrate the deep breath they can finally draw, and the joyful, well-appointed weddings on the horizon.Of course, upon sober reflection, we all know that legislation does not flip a switch on feelings, attitudes and emotions. These biases lag well behind.So if you are the parent, brother, sister, teacher or friend of a gay man or woman and you find yourself bitter today, let me encourage you to turn a page. Allow yourself to open your heart and mind to them, for them and for yourself. Because the train has left the station, and you can continue to be a part of the pain and anxiety and costly emotional heartache, or serve as part of the joy.Because love truly IS love. Simple as that.Also on HuffPost:"

(Photo by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb60650200000990000f769.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Well, by now the whole world knows that Bristol Palin is pregnant. In case you live under a rock -- or are less than 25? -- Bristol is the 24-year-old daughter of former Vice Presidential candidate and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Bristol made news six years ago when she had her first baby (also ""out of wedlock"") at age 18. She subsequently became an abstinence advocate, speaking all over the place about saving yourself for marriage. And publicly apologizing for being a normal sexual human being -- because it's a sin in the eyes of The Lord.I'm not Christian -- so the abstinence thing is lost on me entirely -- and to be quite frank, I think Sarah Palin is sort of a moron. (I'm working on my compassion. I have my limits.)So Bristol is pregnant. And here's what she has to say about it:Palin wrote that she shared the news ""sooner than I ever expected due to the constant trolls who have nothing better to talk about."" Palin wrote that the pregnancy ""has been, and will be, a huge disappointment to my family"" and asked for privacy.""Honestly, I've been trying my hardest to keep my chin up on this one,"" Palin wrote. ""At the end of the day there's nothing I can't do with God by my side, and I know I am fully capable of handling anything that is put in front of me with dignity and grace.""Hold on. It's a ""huge disappointment""?No. It's a baby. It isn't a disappointment, and neither are you.This is heartbreaking, for a couple of reasons: 1. She is pre-shaming herself. Fox News didn't even have time to be assholes (which would have given me even more material). 2. Her parents have created a situation where she has to apologize for procreating, like humans do, all the time. Seriously, like daily.This is inherited shame. It was passed from Sarah to Bristol -- and now to her babies. In the media and everywhere, they will grow up to believe they are a disappointment, a mistake. This is the Palin legacy.And this is the very reason that abstinence education is a really terrifically horrible idea. When we tell our kids, ""Don't have sex because that makes you a sinner, which makes you a horrible person and a disappointment to your whole family and the entire country,"" we are diminishing their worth. We are setting them up to fail. We are setting them up to feel like a failure, less than, ""bad.""Bristol, you are not 'bad'. And I'm not disappointed. You are having a baby. Let's celebrate. I'll knit a hat. Dear Sarah, If this hurts your feelings, just pause to gaze out the window at the tranquil Russian landscape. That should help. *** This story by Joni Edelman first appeared at ravishly.com, an alternative news+culture women's website.

26,BLACK VOICES,What America Owes Blacks,"Kim Lute, ContributorDuPont and Peabody award-winning journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-america-owes-blacks_b_7675390.html,Blacks are expected in a few states to live in the shadows of flag that celebrated and promoted our enslavement under any means necessary.,2015-07-02,"COLUMBIA, SC - JUNE 27: Jaluladin Abdul-Hamib shouts 'Take It Down' while engaging with a group of demonstrators on the grounds of the South Carolina State House calling for the Confederate flag to remain on the State House grounds June 27, 2015 in Columbia, South Carolina. Earlier in the week South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley expressed support for removing the Confederate flag from the State House grounds in the wake of the nine murders at Mother Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0efd240000310096537c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the 1960s, venerated author Joan Didion wrote of America ""that the center wasn't holding."" This ideology still holds true over a half-century later, as the mood of our blighted nation continues to hover just slightly above a clumsily contained chaos, as blacks are forced to watch the continued, and at times systematic, hunting and slaughter of their people. To wit: the murders of nine parishioners at South Carolina's historically significant Emanuel AME church. Adding further insult to an already egregious and appalling crime is that while the city mourned such acts of hate and terrorism, it did so under a Confederate flag. In a noble America, displaying such a symbol would be an act of treason. And confusingly enough, it took mere days before the country's dialogue shifted from the loss of nine black innocents to the oft-discussed issue of gun control and, finally, whether or not the flag is appropriate in a seemingly post-racial America. Discourse regarding its removal merely offers African Americans a modicum of penance, a diversion from the true issue at hand: America has seen only minimal growth beyond her wicked past. If ""we the people"" are ready to shift focus to what can be done above and beyond trifle gestures and repetitive debate, the conversation must include the long overdue issuance of slave reparations. My guess is that most, if not all, blacks would prefer to see the flag lining a cat's litter box, and not in a museum like President Obama foolishly suggested. No one would dare expect Jews to tolerate the conceited displayed of the swastika, but blacks are expected in a few states to live in the shadows of flag that celebrated and promoted our enslavement under any means necessary. Surely, in the wake of both the church shootings and what seems like the methodical and continued state sanctioned murder of blacks by unrepentant, rogue police officers the debate shouldn't center around a relic flag only the lowest among us pledges allegiance to. In honor of those who senselessly lost their lives, addressing how to permanently repair race relations should be our country's most pressing priority.Celebrated African American writer Zora Neale Hurston once wrote, ""There are years that ask questions and years that answer. America is ailing and it's become morally imperative that the issue of slave reparations be addressed now, centuries after she allowed for an unprecedented genocide so calculating and dehumanizing that it has crippled every generation since. A civilized, remorseful, and mannered government would offer some form of remuneration for unspeakable crimes left unchecked, offenses so horrific mothers would rather drown their babies along the trans-Atlantic route than see them toil as slaves in an unforgiving America. And while there isn't a metric system large enough to measure the toll slavery cost, this should not dissuade a democratic body from attempting to correct her wrongs, to finally add a commemorative footnote to a nation's disgraceful history.Also speaking of a 1960s America, Malcolm X famously argued:If you stick a knife in my back 9 inches and pull it out 6 inches, that's not progress, If you pull it out all the way out, that's not progress. The progress comes from healing the wound that the blow made. They [America] haven't begun to pull the knife out... they wont even admit the knife is there.One might ask if it's even possible for a nation to put a value on centuries of barbaric brutality, humiliation and the derogation of being classified as farm equipment, no more deserving of American liberties than cows and goats. For centuries, black men and women were denied their humanity and dignity regardless of recent comments made by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who appears to have woefully ignorant historical perceptions. Such horrors deserve more than a bricks and mortar monument in our nation's capitol. Today, the question remains: What's a crushed spirit worth? How does one tally the number of blacks whose final resting place is the ocean floor? And shall sanctions be multiplied if one lost soul then begat a generation and more of the same? What would it cost to restore one's humanity, to offer redress for robbing one of their lineages? And conversely, what can be said of a nation that offers nothing? Or worse, a nation that asks you to simply forget. Not only does the silence and inaction demean African Americans, turning a blind eye to losses far grander than stolen Picassos, but it also weakens the nation as a whole for we are never greater than our most vulnerable and disenfranchised, never able to fully live up to our principled ideals if we chose to have no memory of our past, which is one born of myths and based in lies. Lehman Brothers, Aetna, JP Morgan Chase and Brooks Brothers are just a few major corporations that benefited from slavery. From using slaves as collateral for loans, to creating clothing for slaves, these companies should, in partnership with a special government committee, work toward drafting a formal form of contrition and compensation, whether it's tax breaks, gratis healthcare, or government-backed loans/grants for collegiate education and potential small business owners. I do not assume to hold all the answers, but I have sundry questions.And while some contend slavery was born solely out of economic necessity, perhaps financial atonement would serve as a reminder that if you profit from others subjugation, your descendants may very well have to pay for the evils of their father. Granted, you cannot pay the dead, nor levy fines on the progenies of slaveholders, even if they continue to benefit from their families past deeds. But America, and other nations, could curtail wasteful government spending and redistribute those funds for those who have been put at an unfair advantage simply because their hair is kinky and their nose's wide. Historically, seeking material benefits has been a futile effort. But if Britain paid reparations to slaveholders in the early 19th century, and not the slaves, why can't America follow her lead? And if Israel and West Germany agreed on a financial settlement in 1952 over cruelties committed during the Holocaust, why can't blacks worldwide seek the same? Was their victimization greater than ours? Is a six-year genocide worthier of expiations than those that lasted hundreds of years, first during the colonization of Africa, and followed by hundreds of years of human trafficking in its most frightening form? The duty of every American is to make sure America is living up to its highest ideals otherwise we will be a nation known as much for our democracy as its tendency to rob minorities of it, the same minorities upon whose scarred backs this country was built. This discussion is crucial and for the sake of our nations conscious, it cannot become the responsibility of another generation. Granted, the removal of the Confederate flag from certain merchants and in front of some state houses is a beginning, it's too small an acquiescence to shift the dialogue some Americans simply want to do away it."

That has been one of the reasons that, as a civil rights lawyer, I love Justice Kennedy's opinions. There is nothing I like more than a good Dignity Kennedy quote to headline my briefs as I argue that people we incarcerate behind bars must retain the fundamental right to be treated like human beings (e.g. ""[P]risoners may be deprived of rights that are fundamental to liberty. Yet the law and the Constitution demand recognition of certain other rights. Prisoners retain the essence of human dignity inherent in all persons.""). I passionately believe, as Kennedy does, that the concept of human dignity should animate the benchmark by which we judge the treatment of our fellow humans (e.g. ""A prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, including adequate medical care, is incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society."").Yet, when I read Justice Thomas's dissent in Obergefell, I was struck by his closing remarks, in which he roiled in frustration at Kennedy's dignity jurisprudence:[T]he Constitution contains no ""dignity"" Clause, and even if it did, the government would be incapable of bestowing dignity. Human dignity has long been understood in this country to be innate... Slaves did not lose their dignity (any more than they lost their humanity) because the government allowed them to be enslaved. Those held in internment camps did not lose their dignity because the government confined them. And those denied governmental benefits certainly do not lose their dignity because the government denies them those benefits. The government cannot bestow dignity, and it cannot take it away.On the one hand, I marveled -- given my experience of watching human beings in prisons across the country routinely left isolated for decades in black boxes of sensory deprivation, denied basic medical care, showers and even underwear -- how even Justice Thomas could sincerely assert that the government cannot take away one's dignity. On the other hand, I wondered whether Thomas, an African American man, also had an important and valid point when he observed that even the bonds of slavery, both physical and legal, could not steal away the dignity and humanity inherent to the men and women who suffered under them.It is one thing to recognize the dignitary harms worked by discriminatory laws and actions -- from slavery to torture to legal categorization as second-class citizens -- and the role the law can -- and, I believe, should  -- play in preventing, correcting and reversing these harms. But it is another to say that human beings must depend on law and social acceptance to confer dignity in the first instance.I was deeply disturbed by the video that circulated just two days before the Supreme Court's marriage decision. During a pride celebration at the White House, Jennicet Gutiérrez, an immigrant and transgender woman of color, interrupted President Obama's speech in the long tradition of progressive activists, to ask him for accountability in his administration's dangerous detention of undocumented LGBT immigrants. In response to her interruption, the President shook his finger at her and scolded that she was in ""his"" house. He suggested that if you are going to come to his house and eat his food, you are also expected to hold your tongue in the service of politeness, respect and civility. The crowd invited to the President's pride celebration obediently echoed the President's literal shaming of Ms. Gutiérrez, drowning her out with chants of ""Obama"" and cheering his order to have her removed from the room.Yet this same group was made up in large part of LGBT activists who had worked tirelessly in the service of marriage equality, laying the social and legal groundwork to bring this issue to the Supreme Court such that it could yield Kennedy's remarkable majority opinion. What did it mean that they would so blithely dismiss a colleague's call for Obama's administration to adopt policies that consistently protect the rights and safety of LGBT persons, instead of cherry-picking those sailing on the right political winds? What did it mean that they would so carelessly give Obama a pass on his administration's alarming detention of undocumented persons in a manner that subjects transgender women to brutal violence, while simultaneously lauding his passing nod to the disproportionate risks trans women of color face on American streets?President Obama and his crowd of cheering supporters did not recognize the dignity of Ms. Gutiérrez in that moment. They believed that she behaved in an undignified manner, ill-befitting the White House and its Presidential company. They gave no pause to reflect on the dignitary harm they may be inflicting by telling a trans woman of color in no uncertain terms that this was not her house. She did not deserve to enjoy the rarified air of that moment with them because she had broken the civility code.But only weeks ago, in the context of the protests in Baltimore, President Obama and many in that same company were likely ruminating on Dr. King's observation that riots are the language of the unheard. Civil rights leaders warned against repression of dissent and protest under the guise of civility and politeness and respect. Stonewall was a riot. ACT UP interrupted elected officials. Activists have long been deemed impolite, disrespectful, and undignified.Ms. Gutiérrez has created an emperor's new clothes moment. As many all over the United States jubilantly post pictures on social media of the White House bathed in rainbow light, we should not ignore the shadow that the President's response to her -- and the policies she was protesting -- cast over that same house. Despite the President's assertion to the contrary, it is our house, in which he lives at our pleasure.I worry that the dignity -- or even affirmation thereof -- many in our community so desperately sought through legal recognition of marriage comes at the cost of recognizing the inherent human dignity of all of those within the larger queer community. Our LGBT forepeople fought for the recognition that there was dignity in the act of being who they were, however they lived and whomever they loved. We must be careful, as some in the LGBT community gain entré to the benefits of ""dignified"" society, not to confuse this with the concept of human dignity itself, which inheres within all of us, regardless of marital or other social or legal status."

You wake up and stare at the blank slate of a day that lies before you. When you think about all that you have to do, the blank slate becomes a tangle of items that you don't know how to prioritize. Paralysis sets in and several hours pass before you realize that you've done little more than hang out on the Internet. That's when the panic arrives. How in the world are you supposed to grow your business if overwhelm sets in every time you think about all that you have to do?I used to experience this phenomenon more times that I care to admit. It was always ironic when I would go through this because one of the principal reasons I quit my job to become an entrepreneur was to have more control over how I spend my time. And yet, having complete control over my schedule threatened to kill my productivity.Awareness has helped transform my inner stance so that I can make the most of my days as an entrepreneur. Below, I share a few strategies that can help you exponentially increase your productivity.Create structureOne of the biggest changes in the switch from employment to entrepreneurship is that business and personal life melt together without clear demarcations. This is particularly true when working from home, and I can easily go from coaching a client to having a chat with my love to watering the plants to Skyping my niece to writing an article, all over the course of a couple of hours. Jumping from task to task really drains me, and I've had to learn how to build in structure so that there are clear hours when I'm working, and clear hours when I'm not. I've found that there are times when I'm naturally more productive (between 11AM and 7P), and so I commit to working within that timeframe (taking several breaks for sanity). The rest of the time I claim as mine to spend however I wish.Creating a productive working space is also important. At home I tend to float between the couch and kitchen table while working and I use several props to get into a proper mindset. There's my laptop, a notebook with a pen, and also my to-do list. Having my to-do list in plain sight subtly helps me stay focused. (Checking items off and looking over all that I've completed in a day makes me feel really good). On days when working from home just isn't cutting it because of distractions, I head to a cafe where I can laser in and focus for a few hours.The key here is to create structure while remaining flexible. For example, if I have to switch things up and work earlier or a later to accommodate items I need to complete, I do that. (And if I need to cut my working day short to allow for more flex time, I do that too). But a structured day remains the status quo for me. It makes me a happier entrepreneur and person.Drop overwhelm as a badge of self-importanceThis was the hardest for me to implement. Whenever people would ask me how I was doing, I would secretly get satisfaction out of going on and on about how ""busy"" and ""overwhelmed"" I was. I would create an entire drama around all of the items that I ""absolutely had"" to complete within a day, even though accomplishing that feat was unrealistic. Reading Steve Chandler's Time Warrior helped clue me into what I was doing: ""Your problem is not that you are overwhelmed,"" Steve Chandler writes, ""Your problem is an attachment to the story of overwhelm.""That insight caused me to closely look at my own story. Most importantly, it helped me cut away all of the self-importance that using terms like ""overwhelmed"" and ""swamped"" made me feel. Once I did this, I realized taking this stance was setting me up for failure. I was playing a game that I would never win because I would always have a daunting list of things to do. Additionally, I was unconsciously ensuring that I would always be overwhelmed so that I could earn sympathy from those I shared my story with.""You can drop the story,"" Chandler advises, ""Try this story: 'I've only got one thing to do! How liberating. It's the thing I'm doing right now.'""When I dropped my story, I immediately had energy to use in productive ways. The payoff was exponential. Instead of seeking pity from others, I was able to talk about far more interesting things than a to-do list. I also began accomplishing more and reaped the benefits of feeling complete at the end of the day. I'll take this over a badge of self-importance any day.Consciously choose items to complete and items to put off to another dayThe best way to integrate the above point is to be super realistic about what can be accomplished within a day, hour and minute. What's the most important thing to be done in this moment? Do that and forget everything else.Here's the thing. Sometimes there are very important items to be done within a day and I realistically can't get to everything. This used to really bother me and I'd spend my time accomplishing one task while worriedly eyeing the other important tasks I had to complete. Fortunately I've found a way to deal with this:I let the relevant parties know if I will be unable to complete something by a promised deadline AND provide a timeframe as to when it will get done. I've had to learn that it's not the fact of having a lot of things to do that trips me up. It's the story that I create around it. Letting people know that something will be late immediately frees me up. It makes me feel responsible and as if I have control over my schedule. I get to stay in a place of consciously choosing how to spend my time which is really what I've wanted all along.An extra note about the InternetI'm not doing this post justice if I don't mention the Internet. Given a lot of my work is done via computer, it's very easy for me to spend time wandering down paths that aren't very productive (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, etc). It's a habit that I've developed (I think it's safe to say that I'm not alone here), and I've not found a surefire way around this. One of the things I've been focusing on is awareness around how I use the computer. I've been using a productivity app that tracks time spent on different sites. It's been really helpful for me to see where my computer time goes. Several moments checking friends' status updates on Facebook can really add up over the course of the week. In all honesty, I'm not doing much about this other than being aware of it. Awareness and observation are foundational for any habit changes that I choose to make.Once the euphoria of working for yourself wears off, it's important to adopt a stance and mindset that ensure you are experiencing life and business on your terms. An important part of this is maintaining control over your time and enhancing your productivity. Give the above tips a try and let me know how they're working for you.

They were amazing leaders who demonstrated seven key tenets of leadership. But one thing that's a little less understood is that most of them were true entrepreneurs, long before the word was even in use. Curious about the paths they followed, I found an 1829 book, Lives of the Signers to the Declaration of Independence by Rev. Charles A. Goodrich. It turns out that most of those who signed the Declaration of Independence started or ran their own businesses.There are some inspiring tales of self-made men within their midst. So as we celebrate the 239th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, here's a breakdown of some of their stories.The Lawyers and DoctorsWalk into just about any legislature now, and you'll see plenty of law degrees on the walls. The politicians of the earliest days of the United States were no different.Honestly, there are too many lawyers among those who signed the Declaration of Independence to list them all, but they had to hustle for clients, argue and advise, and work hard to collect fees just like their modern-day counterparts. Among the most prominent was a future president, John Adams of Massachusetts.My favorite among Goodrich's stories, however, is that of Maryland's Thomas Stone, who practiced law until he was able to ""discharge the obligations under which he had laid himself for his education,"" and then go into farming. (In other words, he practiced law until he paid off his student loans and then found something he was more passionate about.)Another big profession of the time -- medicine -- was also well represented. (I'm including doctors and lawyers together, because this was a time when law and medicine meant arranging for your education and running a business on your own.)Among the doctors were Benjamin Rush of Pennsylvania and Matthew Thornton and Joshua Bartlett of New Hampshire. (Bartlett is better known today as the fictional forefather of Martin Sheen's character in the television show The West Wing.)Oliver Wolcott of Connecticut almost joined the group. He studied to be a doctor as well, but never practiced, Goodrich wrote, as he'd already inherited a fortune and didn't need the money.The HeirsThere were quite a few ""gentlemen of good birth"" who inherited significant fortunes. Some even expanded their fortunes and became entrepreneurs themselves.John Hancock, who signed so boldly that his name became a synonym for a signature itself, took over his uncle's business and ""secured profitable government contracts"" during the French and Indian War. His fellow Massachusetts native, Sam Adams, however, ""lost the entire capital which had been given him by his father,"" in his own business exploits.Virginian Carter Braxton inherited ""a considerable fortune, consisting chiefly of land and slaves,"" Goodrich wrote. Braxton used much of his fortune to help finance pro-Revolutionary causes, and eventually lost much of it. His fellow Virginian, Francis Lightfoot Lee, however, had done so little with his considerable inheritance, that the best Goodrich could say was that he'd devoted his early years ""to reading, and to the enjoyment of his friends.""The Self-Made MenThe most interesting stories come from the men who built their own fortunes.Born in Ireland, George Taylor arrived in the New World ""entirely destitute,"" according to Goodrich, and went to work as a manual laborer, starting with the job of feeding a coal furnace. Taylor was promoted to clerk, and when his boss died Taylor wound up with the man's widow. He took over the man's businesses as well and ultimately built ""a considerable estate.""George Walton, the last of the Georgia delegation, was a carpenter's apprentice whose boss ""not only kept him closely at labor during the day, but refused him the privilege of a candle, by which to read at night."" Undeterred, Walton would scrounge wood so as to be able to read by the fire. He learned enough that he was eventually able to study as a lawyer.Roger Sherman of Connecticut began as a shoemaker when his father's death left him responsible to provide for his family, and eventually became a successful merchant. Meantime, New York's Francis Lewis, a Welsch immigrant, became a trader throughout Europe, but unfortunately lost most of his fortune during the Revolution, Goodrich wrote, and spent his last days ""in comparative poverty.""Another orphan, Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, apprenticed in a ""counting house"" and eventually went into business with a friend, Thomas Willing, in 1754. The two men worked together for 39 years.Want to read more, make suggestions, or even be featured in a future column? Follow me on Facebook, or contact me and sign up for my weekly email.

Obama, Bonhoeffer, and America's Soul","Travis Knoll, ContributorHistory PhD Student, Duke University.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-the-cost-of-grace_b_7701372.html,"Whatever our differences, Christian Americans should lend our ears, if not to Obama's call to our natures' better angels, at least to God's call for universal self-sacrifice and self-reflection on the whole range of pressing moral issues facing America.",2015-07-02,2015-07-02-1435805970-2152704-Dietrich_Bonhoeffer_Skulptur_an_der_Hauptkirche_Sankt_Petri_Hamburg1.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-07-02-1435805970-2152704-Dietrich_Bonhoeffer_Skulptur_an_der_Hauptkirche_Sankt_Petri_Hamburg1-thumb.JPG,"Last week, Obama gave a moving eulogy  at the College of Charleston in Charleston South Carolina for the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church's slain pastor Clementa Pinckney. Commentators have praised the speech for its deft navigation of religion and politics as Obama himself has linked the tragedy to specific calls for gun regulation.In his message, Obama became not only President and honorary parishioner, but preacher, placing demands on a still nominally Christian nation to rely on grace in order to live up to its unofficial spiritual creeds. Yes, Obama's speech laid out his spiritual vision for the country's racial conversation, but how does his conception of grace fit in Christian tradition? What risks and opportunities might this vision present for communities that wish to engage in direct political action?The word ""grace"" appears a full thirty-five times in Obama's eulogy. Obama gave specific prescriptions for how to earn ""national"" grace. He argued that removing the Confederate flag, a ""reminder of systemic oppression,"" would ""express God's grace."" He went further still, affirming that national grace also requires resolving other areas of ""blindness"" such as poor education in minority communities, employment bias, gun violence, police training, and criminal justice reform.Such a politicized definition of grace may grate on Christians, like Rick Santorum and Jeb Bush, who wish for ""theology and morality"" to be separated from systemic social issues. Nevertheless, the concept of grace as a catalyst for political conscience finds resonance in the witness of one of the Twentieth Century's most compelling martyrs, German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer*. Educated in Tübingen University, in 1930 he became a lecturer in systematic theology at Berlin University. He also visited the United States, where he especially grew to appreciate the America's Black Church tradition during his time in Harlem. He returned to Germany in 1939 to become one of the main leaders of the Confessional Church, an organization of religious groups opposed to the regime. He also joined the famous 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and attempt to find a settlement with the Allies. Memorial of Dietrich Bonhoeffer in front of St. Peter's Church, Hamburg from Wikipedia Commons courtesy of David Meisel Bonhoeffer wrote in his book, Cost of Discipleship, of ""cheap"" and ""costly"" grace. ""Cheap grace"" Bonhoeffer wrote, ""is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession, absolution without personal confession...grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate (44-45).""Costly grace on the other hand was ""the Kingly rule of Christ...the gospel which must be sought again and again, the gift which must be asked for, the door at which a man must knock.""Like Bonhoeffer's ""costly grace"", Obama's grace implies divine and human intervention in the political and social sphere. Obama started the ""grace"" section of the speech describing the Emmanuel's role in the Underground Railroad and the Civil Rights Movement as a place of ""inviolable dignity"" for African-American activist. He continued on to describe the slaying of Pinckney, a pastor and state legislator, by a racist who was clear in his racist motivations. Obama, to claps and shouts of agreement from the audience, recounted how the killing did not spur the killer's hoped-for racial conflict based on the American ""original sin"" of slavery , but rather, national action and unity:Oh, but God works in mysterious ways. (Applause.) God has different ideas. (Applause.) While Obama's grace is, like Bonhoeffer's, politically radical, it's also conceptually broad, almost universal. Bonhoeffer's grace was deeply orthodox. He believed that ""costly grace"" could cost a man his physical life in order to gain Christ. He ridiculed ""grace as a doctrine, a principle, a system (p.43).""[Grace] is costly because it condemns sin, and grace because it justifies the sinner. Above all, it is costly because it cost God the life of his Son (p.45). During the 1930s and 1940s, Bonhoeffer called for a political resistance, the ""other Germany"" (p.27) that would preserve Western civilization against what he saw a the false idol: The racist fascism of National Socialism which had put blood divisions above the dignity of the human person. As Hitler grew more powerful, Bonhoeffer raised the stakes for his spiritual comrades, exhorting ""He who severs himself from the Confessional Church severs himself from the Grace of God (p.31).""  Obama's call to action-filled grace undoubtedly echoes Bonhoeffer's, but the latter's emphasis on martyrdom and orthodoxy also presents potential points of conflict between Obama's administration and Christians of conscience. The sincerest of his opponents may just as easily (many times correctly) invoke the idea of a ""costly"" grace, a political martyrdom of religious conscience, in defense of exclusively heterosexual marriage, or protecting a fetus. These are issues where Obama is, frankly, at odds with Christian tradition (although not always the majority of Americans).That caution aside, remembering Bonhoeffer's example, supporters and opponents of Obama must at least recognize that the president was not hijacking or politicizing Christianity (which always had political implications) in his speech from the pulpit. Rather, he was participating in the religion's constant revival by seizing on the universal Church's social message as a legitimate rallying cry against indifference. Whatever our differences, Christian Americans should lend our ears, if not to Obama's call to our natures' better angels, at least to God's call for universal self-sacrifice and self-reflection on the whole range of pressing moral issues facing America.*Pages referenced come from: Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Cost of Discipleship (Touchstone Edition, 1995)."

Friends and family wanted to make sure that I had heard about the Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage in all 50 states. I was elated. I picked up the phone to call my mom and realized that I could not reach her because she was on a plane to New Zealand to visit family. I can't wait for her to return so we can share this news in person.As a child, I never could have imagined this day coming in this way. Our lives were filled with fear and secrets in a culture where discrimination, violence and hatred towards lesbians and gay men was so pervasive. I was afraid all the time of people asking me questions about my mom and our home life. I knew and had seen the very real consequences for our lives and her livelihood. As a little kid, I became adept at changing the subject with friends, parents of friends, teachers, everyone. I was afraid walking in the city at night when we were all together and afraid for my mom when she was out at night with her partner. My brother told my mother to lie about who her partner was and pleaded with her to wear certain kinds of clothes and not others. I knew why he did it. The teasing from kids and the not subtle messages from teachers were in great abundance. And though I didn't say things out loud, I also had my own internalized rules for the secrets and lies I told. When my best friend in middle school finally cornered me by asking a direct question that I could no longer avoid, I felt like my heart and lungs would stop functioning as I formed the words.As it turned out, she responded really well. It was an amazing feeling.I also could not have imagined the victory coming in this way because when I was a child, marriage was not the dominant issue the gay and lesbian community was fighting for. In fact, many in the community I was raised in rejected the notion of marriage. Their demands were for rights that seemed more pressing, such as safety and equality under the law in employment, schooling and housing.

Her courageous choices were about her, and they were also very much about us, her kids. She knew she had to live a life that would show her children how to fully live. I will be forever grateful for the gift that this has been in my life.This morning, we see how the arc of history bends with the slow and steady persistence of so many. A new narrative emerged that shined the light on many of these issues in unforeseen ways. As Jews, we know how powerful our stories are to shape who we are and how we see our selves as a people. The narrative of love and marriage in the United States has been transformed, and with it great change has come. Incredible change. I am so blown away by how far we have come. And at the same time I know we have so far to go.The week's reading from the Torah (Hebrew Bible) that coincides with the Court's decision is Chukat. It recounts a moment when the people near the end of their journey through the wilderness gathered and sing at a well. There is love at the well for our people (most of the mates meet at a well) and in this verse (Numbers 21:17) it speaks of the people singing together at a well. But interestingly the portion does not mention Moses. Before, when we made the great exodus from Egypt and crossed the sea, the verse says ""az yashir Moshe""; it was Moses who led the singing. This time it is ""az yashir Israel."" It is not one single leader, it is all the people leading the song. After years of traveling in the wilderness, struggling through the wilderness, the song is now our song. I glance at Facebook and already it is filled with so many incredible images of couples and weddings. Many of these couples that I see I had the honor of standing under the chuppah with and officiating their marriage. Some of these were before marriage was legal in California, and some of them were after. They were all valid right in the moment they happened. Love was declared witnessed and affirmed by those gathered and by the presence of the divine.Today is a day of awe and celebration for all the very real protections and rights under the law that this decision brings. And the song is ours to sing. The path forward is ours to name. There is much more for love to do. Much more song to be sung.Safe travels across the seas, Mama. What a journey this has been.Also on HuffPost:"

Friends and family wanted to make sure that I had heard about the Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage in all 50 states. I was elated. I picked up the phone to call my mom and realized that I could not reach her because she was on a plane to New Zealand to visit family. I can't wait for her to return so we can share this news in person.As a child, I never could have imagined this day coming in this way. Our lives were filled with fear and secrets in a culture where discrimination, violence and hatred towards lesbians and gay men was so pervasive. I was afraid all the time of people asking me questions about my mom and our home life. I knew and had seen the very real consequences for our lives and her livelihood. As a little kid, I became adept at changing the subject with friends, parents of friends, teachers, everyone. I was afraid walking in the city at night when we were all together and afraid for my mom when she was out at night with her partner. My brother told my mother to lie about who her partner was and pleaded with her to wear certain kinds of clothes and not others. I knew why he did it. The teasing from kids and the not subtle messages from teachers were in great abundance. And though I didn't say things out loud, I also had my own internalized rules for the secrets and lies I told. When my best friend in middle school finally cornered me by asking a direct question that I could no longer avoid, I felt like my heart and lungs would stop functioning as I formed the words.As it turned out, she responded really well. It was an amazing feeling.I also could not have imagined the victory coming in this way because when I was a child, marriage was not the dominant issue the gay and lesbian community was fighting for. In fact, many in the community I was raised in rejected the notion of marriage. Their demands were for rights that seemed more pressing, such as safety and equality under the law in employment, schooling and housing.

34,HEALTHY LIVING,Motorcycle Safety: One Man's Mission to Change Driver Awareness,"Lorraine Roe, ContributorAuthor, Investigative Producer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/motorcycle-safety-one-man_b_7701852.html,,2015-07-02,2015-07-01-1435714272-7513704-natebikebarncopy.jpg.tiff,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-07-01-1435714272-7513704-natebikebarncopy.jpg-thumb.tiff,"Seeing motorcyclists can be a matter of life and death, especially for the person on two wheels. With more than 8 million motorcycles on the road in the United States, that's a lot of bikes to watch out for. Car drivers often don't see motorcyclists the way they can see other cars.This summer a motorcycle rider is zigzagging across the country on a campaign to make riding and driving safer for all of us. He isn't just visiting a few states, he's visiting all 50.  Nate Hudson has been riding motorcycles for 20 years. He's taking the ride of a lifetime in an effort to make life on the road better for all of us. As I write this Hudson is riding to state capitals and motor vehicle departments across the United States. He's talking to lawmakers and motor vehicle department administrators about beefing up their motor vehicle safety test in all states. The idea is to place a new question on the state's car driving tests to increase awareness about sharing the road with motorcycles. I'm interested in Nate Hudson's impact on state lawmakers because I myself ride on two wheels through city intersections, a lot. As the driver of a car, I never understood what little awareness I had of motorcyclists, until I became a rider myself. Now I know I have to be aware at all times about other motorcyclists on the road. I've also seen my share of distracted drivers, who at times drifted into my lane or pulled in front of me on my bike, when they didn't have the right of way.Hudson says, ""My hope is to inspire other motorists to learn ways to watch out for us, because there's no room for error on two wheels. Three motorcyclists get killed at intersections every day.""According a 2007 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), roughly half of all motorcycle accidents occur at traffic intersections. Agency statistics show the majority of the accidents involve a motorcycle and a passenger vehicle. The same motorcycle accident statistics reveal those accidents are most often caused by drivers of passenger vehicles. Simply put... car drivers often don't see motorcyclists until it's too late.""Drivers zone out and someone gets hurt,"" Hudson tells me. Hudson is spending 2.5 months on a motorcycle braving humidity, summer storms, and a bug splattered helmet to get the word out to drivers. Still, he has nothing but good things to say about his trip so far, where he has now visited twenty five state capitals, the midpoint being Lincoln, Nebraska. Hudson says he's met amazing, optimistic people across the country. This month, while riding for the motorcycle awareness campaign, Hudson learned his father had died. He took time off to attend the funeral, then climbed back onto his bike to carry the message of motorcycle awareness.Hudson tells me his dad inspired him to ride motorcycles, riding them because they were fun, not because they were considered cool. Hudson says his father was completely behind him taking this trip to increase motorcycle awareness. Since his father passed, Hudson says the cross country mission has become even more sacred to him.Hudson is sponsored by Allstate Insurance. Hudson's summer ride is called The Allstate Ride For Awareness. Hudson told me he wanted to make the trip becasue he's all about passion. He hopes the campaign will encourage drivers to not just look once, but look twice for motorcyclists.Hudson and his friends are so motivated by motorcycles that they started a riding club and motorcycle shop in Long Beach. It's called BA Moto and when he's not on the road, he's there working on bikes and socializing. Hudson also has a lot of friends and family that he's close to, who support his motorcycle obsession.What's Hudson riding for 111 days? He's on an Indian Roadmaster and it's packed to the brim with supplies. Hudson's great hope for his ride is that it will inspire people across the country to ride and be safe.You can follow his journey on Instagram at ba_moto and find his learn more about his journey on his blog."
