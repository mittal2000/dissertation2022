Individually, these Danes are seemingly lovely, attractive, well-dressed people. Put them together and they are an L.L. Bean photo shoot.Much to our delight, Denmark's royal fam actually likes photo shoots and gathers for a family portrait annually. This year, like last, the bucolic backdrop was the same. But Mary Frederik and the gang one-upped last year's shoot with a special edition: puppies!And some more family members. Joining the royal dog, as well as Mary, Frederik and their brood, were Princess Benedikte (Queen Margrethe II's younger sister), Princess Alexandra (Princess Benedikte's daughter) and Alexandra's children, Count Richard and Countess Ingrid. The group squeezed around a park bench down by a little pond, which seemed to provide endless entertainment for little Prince Vincent. (Ed. note: look how much Prince Vincent has grown!)Check it out.

I know I'm not alone when I say that I absolutely love watching the events on TV and sometimes even hosting themed parties is a strong possibility.Considering the Summer Olympics this year are being held in London, I can't help but think British this and British that. If I can't be in London for them (I think my invitation must have gotten lost in the mail), I am going to at least pretend I'm there in every way I can. British culture has impacted many parts of the world in many facets for quite some time now. From music, to fashion, to beauty, to TV shows -- and let's not forget the wedding to end all weddings last April -- and now the Olympics. Everyone seems to want to dive into the English culture deeper and deeper. People certainly seem to be infatuated with British-based trends and brands these days.And, with that, some of my personal favorite items.Burberry Body EDT Burberry Lip Mist Sheer LipstickBen Sherman Removable Collar Striped ShirtSPACE NK Candle - Charcoal RoseHarrods Tea TrioAstley Clarke EarringsFrench Sole Ballet FlatsWhatever your plans are for watching the Summer Olympics, make sure to do it in style.
