But Congress is already flirting with a government shutdown, and presidential candidate Jeb Bush put out a tax plan that makes his brother's tax cuts for the wealthy look like child's play. Listen to The Huffington Post's A-team dissect the meaning of all this and more on this week's politics podcast. This week, hosts Jason Linkins, Arthur Delaney and Zach Carter are joined by Rep.

Rick Perry (R) announced Friday he is ending his presidential campaign.Perry announced the end of his campaign at the Eagle Forum -- an event founded by conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly -- in St. Louis, Missouri.""We have a tremendous field – the best in a generation – so I step aside knowing our party is in good hands, and as long as we listen to the grassroots, the cause of conservatism will be too,"" Perry said.""I give you this news with no regrets,"" Perry added. ""It has been a privilege and an honor to travel this country, to speak with the American people about their hopes and dreams, to see a sense of optimism prevalent despite a season of cynical politics.""Perry announced his presidential run on June 4. This was his second attempt at the White House -- he ran unsuccessfully in the 2012 GOP primary.Perry was forced to cut staff as he was plagued by poor fundraising numbers. He had hoped to stay afloat with the help of an allied super PAC, but his standing in the race did not improve.Perry entered the 2016 campaign as an underdog after suffering an embarrassing setback in his 2012 campaign, where he infamously forgot which three federal agencies he wanted to cut as president and uttered ""oops"" on a GOP debate stage. Perry told The Huffington Post in April he felt more prepared this time around, even with less bells and whistles surrounding his presidential efforts.“You know, I find this to be a lot more efficient,” he said. “And more real.”There are still 16 Republicans competing in the GOP primary race. According to HuffPost Pollster, former reality television star Donald Trump is currently leading the race, with former neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also polling ahead of the pack.Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker told The Huffington Post he'd be gunning for Perry's supporters, praising the former governor's track record in Texas. ""What we will try to do is try to get support from people who supported him, and any other candidate that's next moving forward,"" Walker said. ""If someone liked the governor, a good conservative governor that actually got things done, certainly we would be top on their list of those voters out there.""Other 2016 contenders offered words of praise for Perry: Samantha-Jo Roth contributed reporting.Also on HuffPost:"

For New York Fashion Week, Legend collaborated with AXE's White Label Collective to choose five young menswear designers and give them the opportunity to show their unique collections on September 10. Legend, along with designer Billy Reid and Esquire magazine's fashion director Nick Sullivan, mentored the up-and-comers prior to the main event. The Huffington Post sat down with Legend to talk about this awesome initiative, and he expressed his thoughts on diversity in the fashion industry. The singer doesn't have a style icon. Instead, he likes to dress like himself. ""I like things that feel like they’re timeless and really well made and tailored ... things that make me feel confident when I leave the house,"" he says. So it's no surprise that he's backing designers like Ryan Barr and Savannah Yarborough, who specialize in custom designs and bespoke items. ""They all deserve this opportunity and are doing cool stuff, different stuff from each other -- but they are all really talented in their own way,"" Legend adds. The other three designers include Stanley Cheung, Afriyie Poku and Kristopher Haigh. As a force in elevating unknown voices in fashion, Legend notes that the industry should also be inclusive and open. ""I feel like fashion is making steps toward diversity, but I think they could do more,"" he says. Legend adds that fashion should effectively market to its customer base, which he describes as ""a diverse group of people of different shapes, colors and sizes."" Another reason to diversify fashion? ""It [would] show everyone out there different forms of beauty, that everyone can be beautiful in their own way and that fashion’s for everybody."" Well said, Mr. Legend. Take a look at the AXE White Label Collective looks below. This season, HuffPost Lifestyle will disrupt New York Fashion Week to ensure that it is an inclusive event for people of all skin tones, genders, sizes, shapes and personalities. Over the next week, we'll be highlighting designers, models and runway shows that are working to democratize NYFW.

But the coverage often fails to go into any depth.In an effort to spur more comprehensive coverage of capital punishment, the Marshall Project -- a non-profit, non-partisan criminal justice-focused news organization -- has launched a new partnership with outlets in all nine U.S. states that have executed people since 2013 plus Arkansas, which is planning to resume executions after a hiatus.The project, called The Next to Die, offers a database that includes detailed information from the Death Penalty Information Center and participating media outlets about inmates facing execution in the U.S., as well as embeddable countdowns.Currently featured prominently on the website is 51-year-old Richard Glossip, who is scheduled to be put to death on Sept. 16 in Oklahoma. Glossip has spent 17 years on death row after being convicted of first-degree murder in 1998, though he maintains his innocence and has attracted high-profile supporters. Included in the information on Glossip is a link to a lengthy feature about his case from the Tulsa Frontier.In an interview with the Nieman Lab’s Justin Ellis, project managing editor Gabriel Dance explained that he anticipates the database could eventually be used to track patterns in U.S. executions, such as what types of people are sentenced to death or which district attorneys have high conviction rates in such cases. Another editor compared it to the work being done by other media partnerships like PolitiFact and Homicide Watch.Ziva Branstetter, editor-in-chief at the Tulsa Frontier, a participating news startup, told Nieman she is optimistic the project will result in more thorough coverage.“The state is sending someone to death -- this is the most severe action they can take,” Branstetter told Nieman. “We should cover it all with the same attention, no matter the manpower.”MORE:Remezcla: These Anti-Princess Books Give Young Girls Badass Latina Heroines to Look Up To BBC: Russia: Government Mobile App To Help AlcoholicsThe What’s Working Honor Roll highlights some of the best reporting and analysis, from a range of media outlets, on all the ways people are working toward solutions to some of our greatest challenges.

It killed an elderly Wyoming man earlier this year after causing a severe infection of his central nervous system, Murphy said.Tularemia can be transmitted to people through handling of sick animals, including pets like cats and dogs that have come in contact with infected rabbits or rodents, as well as bites from ticks, deer flies or horse flies.Infections also are linked to activities such as lawn mowing, in which people inhale bacteria from contaminated dust, or handling animal carcasses, health officials said.They are warning people in the four states to avoid contact with ailing or dead rabbits or rodents, especially without wearing rubber gloves and masks, and advised testing of pets showing any symptoms.Animals that tested positive for tularemia near Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming led the National Park Service to post signs urging visitors to stay on marked trails and avoid contact with animals.(Reporting by Laura Zuckerman in Salmon, Idaho; Editing by Dan Whitcomb and Sandra Maler)  Also on HuffPost:"

He said the injuries were an accident.Madison police released video of the encounter, recorded from inside a patrol vehicle.The department apologized for Parker’s actions and recommended his termination, which he has challenged.The grandfather had been on a morning walk about two weeks after moving from India to northern Alabama to help his son’s family care for a young child.The officer was following up on a call about a suspicious person.Patel, who also testified during the trial, has sued Parker and the city, alleging racism played into his treatment.Parker was charged in state court with misdemeanor assault.

8,POLITICS,Recent Federal Student Loans Look A Lot Like Subprime Mortgages,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/recent-federal-student-loans-look-a-lot-like-subprime-mortgages_us_55f1cca6e4b093be51be0ad9,Americans who recently took out federal student loans aren't paying down their debt.,2015-09-11,<p>Education Secretary Arne Duncan at a news conference in July. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Federal student loans made in recent years resemble the toxic subprime mortgage loans that helped cause the Great Recession, new data show.Rather than paying down their balances after leaving school, borrowers with recent federal student loans are experiencing an increase in debt as they fail to make enough payments to offset the accumulating interest on their loans.The situation parallels subprime mortgages before the financial crisis, when lenders gave borrowers loans they couldn't afford by allowing them to make payments that didn't actually reduce their balances.But while borrowers with toxic subprime loans largely defaulted and lost their homes as their lenders recorded losses, borrowers with federal student loans are likely to have their suffering drawn out for years thanks to a stagnant economy in which wages are barely rising, and existing law and Education Department practices that make it nearly impossible for struggling borrowers to discharge their debt in bankruptcy.The new data are from a paper made public Thursday by the Brookings Institution in Washington that sheds light on the historically opaque federal student loan portfolio by examining borrowers' repayment practices and wages by the type of school they attended.More than 40 million Americans collectively owe nearly $1.2 trillion on their federal student loans. But the study by Adam Looney, a Treasury Department economist, and Constantine Yannelis, a former Treasury intern who's now a graduate student at Stanford University, is the first to analyze borrowers' debt burdens by linking them to their earnings information from federal tax records.To be sure, the data is based on a sample of borrowers' files contained in the National Student Loan Data System, an Education Department-run database that experts contend is rife with errors.Still, some of the paper's findings mirror conventional wisdom and previous research, such as the fact that students at for-profit colleges largely come from low-income households, borrow too much relative to their eventual earnings, and subsequently default on their federal student loans at astronomical rates.But the paper also includes new information never made public by the Education Department, which oversees the federal student loan program. That information, which includes borrowers' progress in paying down their debt and the rate at which they default five years after leaving school, is likely to inject new life into a debate over whether the federal government is properly serving students and taxpayers.It also raises fresh questions about the role played by the Education Department's loan servicers, who counsel borrowers on their repayment options and collect their monthly payments. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is weighing whether to sue one of them, Navient Corp., for allegedly mistreating student loan borrowers. Navient has denied wrongdoing.""We're engaging in high-risk behavior we hadn't engaged in before,"" said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. He described the data as ""stunning.""Borrowers whose federal student loans came due in 2010, 2011 and 2012 collectively owed more on that debt two years after they first entered repayment, according to the study.Borrowers' collective loan balances had never before increased in the two years after they entered repayment, according to data dating to 1970. In the 25-year period that ended in 1995, for example, borrowers had generally paid down about 15 percent of their collective balances in the two years after their loans came due.More than half of borrowers who entered repayment in 2010, 2011 and 2012 saw their loan balances rise two years later. That, too, is a first for the federal student loan program, where for decades a majority of borrowers had paid down at least a portion of their debt in the two years after they were required to make payments.For borrowers whose bills first came due in 2012, 57 percent of them owed more on their federal student loans by 2014, the study shows. By contrast, less than 40 percent of borrowers who entered repayment from 1996 to 2006 experienced an increase in their balances two years after leaving school.The paper doesn't explain why borrowers' loan balances are growing at a time when they're supposed to be decreasing. Possible reasons include the increased use of federal plans that allow borrowers to make payments based on their earnings, the heavy use of forbearance plans in which borrowers' required payments are delayed, and rising defaults as students increasingly flocked to questionable for-profit colleges in the wake of the Great Recession but were unable to secure jobs that would enable them to repay their loans.About half of recent borrowers entered into forbearance plans in the first year their loans were due, according to the paper. These borrowers likely qualified for income-linked repayment plans that would've enabled them to at least make some of their required payments.""These statistics should concern any reasonable person who remembers the gathering storm of the subprime mortgage debacle,"" Nassirian said. ""We had an educational financing system that generally had operated fairly well on the basis of certain prudent practices that we have increasingly abandoned.""Take for-profit colleges. After abuses surfaced in the late 1980s, Congress cracked down on the sector with more stringent rules that limited their ability to tap federal student aid and led to stronger consumer protections. Of former for-profit college students whose federal student loan payments were first required between 1988 and 1993, more than half had defaulted within the following five years, according to the study.But as memories of those abuses faded, Congress and the George W. Bush administration chipped away at the restrictions, leading to an eventual explosion in the number of students seeking credentials from for-profit schools.Now some of the nation's largest for-profits have among the worst student outcomes, according to the study.For student borrowers who attended schools operating under the DeVry, Capella, Strayer and ITT brand names, and whose loans came due in 2009, they collectively owed more on that debt by 2014. In fact, among all student borrowers who attended for-profit colleges and whose payments were first required in 2009, they owed $1.05 by 2014 for every $1 they owed in 2009, data show.In other words, they made no progress in paying down their debts. Instead, their situations worsened.Their default rates are just as worrisome, according to the study. At Kaplan University, 53 percent of students who entered repayment in 2009 had defaulted by 2014. Some 47 percent of students at Ashford University defaulted within five years, while at the University of Phoenix, the figure was 45 percent. At DeVry, 43 percent of student borrowers whose bills came due in 2009 had defaulted by 2014. ITT's share of defaulters was 51 percent.Their official Education Department-published default rates, which look at the share of borrowers who default within three fiscal years of their loans first coming due, were much lower, sometimes by half as much.A loan goes into default when a borrower misses nine months of payments. Of all student borrowers whose loans came due in 2009, 28 percent of them had defaulted by 2014. At for-profit colleges, which claim to serve high-risk students who have been shunned by public and nonprofit schools, the five-year default rate was 47 percent.The Obama administration has introduced a new rule to clean up the for-profit sector by prohibiting federal student aid at wasteful career-training programs where graduates' earnings aren't high enough to reasonably pay down their debts. But the rule does little to address drop-outs, who make up the bulk of student loan defaults.""These numbers are early-warning signs that we should re-examine our ways,"" Nassirian said. ""We ought to be very concerned that we may have changed some of the most basic features of the entire financing scheme, and should stop consoling ourselves that things will be OK in the future because they've been OK in the past."""

Deputy Editor-in-Chief Jim Rich will take over Myler's position after he departs at the end of the year.“Colin as we all know is also a master at developing editorial leadership and talent,” Holiber wrote in the memo. “With that said, we are delighted to announce that one of our own, Jim Rich, Colin’s deputy, will become our new Editor in Chief, later in the year, after Colin’s departure.”Under Myler's leadership, the Daily News increased its coverage of celebrity news and increasingly focused on national issues, which included the paper's campaign for greater gun control. Myler's departure comes on the heels of Zuckerman’s failed attempt to sell the paper.“He has changed the culture of our newsroom, expanded the Daily News brand to a national level -- in print and digitally -- and overseen the doubling of our website audience,” Zuckerman and Holiber wrote.Despite an increase in web traffic, the Daily News has experienced a precipitous decline in circulation and ad revenue, like newspapers elsewhere. The paper's subscriber rolls have dipped by more than 10 percent since 2007.Myler was previously editor of another News Corp publication, the British tabloid News of the World, which was shuttered in 2011 amid a phone-hacking scandal. Several members of News of the World's staff were charged and convicted of various crimes, though Myler was never implicated in the scandal."

Instead, he was seeking to embody the subdued, “happy warrior” persona -- so diametrically opposed to Donald Trump’s hyperactive, insult-dispensing tack -- that has worked so well for him thus far.“I’m not competing with Mr. Trump,” Carson added. “But I do have a vision for this nation, which I think is shared by a lot of Americans."" As surprising as Trump’s early success has been to just about everyone, other than the candidate himself, Carson’s rise to second place in the national polls has perhaps been even more unlikely.After all, he's pulled off this feat with a fraction of the media attention that Trump has received, and he has done it at a decibel level that barely registers, while his catchphrase-wielding opponent seeks to move the needle into the red at every turn.The world-renowned neurosurgeon has yet to air a negative ad against any of his opponents and had his greatest moment of success so far at the first GOP debate, in which his laid-back demeanor led pundits to initially declare that he had faltered before the polls quickly showed otherwise.Carson wasn’t always so demure in the political arena.He first set Republicans’ hearts aflutter in early 2013, when he personally reprimanded President Barack Obama at a national prayer breakfast and then leveraged that appearance into a career as a tell-it-like-it-is Fox News pundit and bestselling author with a penchant for arguing that the U.S. was on the verge of becoming another Third Reich.At the campaign’s outset, it was reasonable to peg Carson as the latest iteration of a familiar kind of Republican also-ran: a conservative bomb-thrower with minimal political experience, a facility for provocation and zero chance of getting elected.But over the last few months, Carson has turned away from Nazi analogies, taking a starkly subdued tone to a 2016 presidential bid that remains a long-shot, but can no longer be ignored. Perhaps even more important than the national polls -- in which Carson is now ranked second for the Republican nomination -- is a Monmouth University poll released last week, which had him tied with Trump for first place in the kickoff voting state of Iowa. Carson is resonating especially well with the state's highly disenchanted, deeply conservative GOP caucus-goers, some of whom have rallied behind Trump. But Carson’s supporters, by contrast, seem to be attracted to a surgeon’s steady hand more than a carnival barker’s fulminations and boasts.“Ben may have a quiet voice, but he has a very strong message,” said Ryan Rhodes, who is helming Carson’s Iowa effort. “Once people see him and get to talk to him, all of a sudden they’re fully bought in because he’s just so genuine. That’s the thing that’s resonating in Iowa. His entire life has been spent helping people and going out of his way to do things for others, and you just see that instinctively in him.”Yet that likability factor is suddenly being put to the test. Carson has shown signs this week that he has become less interested in pulling his punches. On Tuesday, he took an opportunity to criticize Trump’s plan for deporting all of the country’s undocumented immigrants as unrealistic. And Carson dropped the hammer on Wednesday after a well-attended rally in Orange County, California, when a reporter asked him about what he saw as the biggest difference between him and Trump.“I realize where my successes come from and I don’t in any way deny my faith in God,” he said.Carson’s surprisingly acerbic shot at Trump’s faith appeared designed to chip into his bombastic opponent’s surprisingly strong standing among evangelical caucus-goers in Iowa.As someone who talks frequently and easily about his own faith, Carson has long been a particular object of admiration in Iowa’s politically active homeschooling community -- a key constituency for any socially conservative Republican who hopes to triumph in the caucuses.Carson has not yet spent as much time on the ground in Iowa as some of his opponents have, but all of his events there this year have generated strong turnouts, and his campaign there is well-organized.With the highest favorability rating in the GOP field, it’s clear that Carson’s low-key demeanor, combined with his religiosity, is paying dividends.“Carson has an advantage with social conservatives and evangelicals,” said Shane Vander Hart, the founder and editor-in-chief of the Iowa-based Christian conservative news and commentary site Caffeinated Thoughts. “They simply trust Carson more than Trump on the issues of religious liberty, life and marriage.”Though he currently shows no sign of fading, Carson has faced significantly less media scrutiny than other major GOP candidates have so far. This is his first campaign for political office, and the possibility that he will commit a grievous error on the stump remains.So does the near-certainty that Carson's GOP opponents -- who, up until now, have laid off of him almost entirely -- will soon put him to the test in debates and ads. And they certainly won't hold back when it comes to engaging in policy debates.Trump didn’t waste any time before hitting back on Thursday morning over Carson’s comments on his faith, telling CNN that his low-key rival makes Jeb Bush “look like the energizer bunny.” In spite of the recent spat, however, Carson may be disinclined to engage in an extended insult exchange with Trump that doesn’t befit his style.And like Trump, he has managed to slide by while his platform remains relatively light on specifics. He's focused instead on his “vision” -- a luxury for an under-the-radar candidate that's unlikely to be available to him much longer.“The real test of Carson's candidacy is yet to come, as his positions, or lack thereof, are analyzed and put under the white hot lights of the national press and blogger corps,” said Iowa GOP strategist Tim Albrecht.“Ben Carson's humble demeanor will get him in the door with Iowa conservatives, but they'll be watching closely to see if he puts any specifics behind the benign policy platitudes we've seen him offer thus far.”"

The Oath Keepers, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization, as a “fiercely anti-government, militaristic group,” say they have their sights set on defending the Rowan County clerk, who has refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.In a phone call with Jackson County Kentucky Sheriff Denny Peyman, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes said members of his group had reached out to Davis's legal team and were already forming an on-the-ground presence in Kentucky's Rowan County, but remained tight-lipped on specifics, Right Wing Watch reports. Rhodes said his group's action had nothing to do with same-sex marriage, but instead was focused on his belief that Davis had been illegally detained after being found in contempt of court by not issuing marriage licenses. ""As far as we’re concerned, this is not over,” he said in the audio clip above. “This judge needs to be put on notice that his behavior is not going to be accepted, and we’ll be there to stop it and intercede ourselves if we have to."" Rhodes went on to compare Davis's plight to that of the Founding Fathers, in that it deals ""with the magistrates and the officers of the crown who wanted to run roughshod over the rights of the colonists without a jury indictment, without any of that.""Arguing that the U.S. has an ""unconstitutional imperial presidency"" in place, Rhodes said in a statement on the Oath Keepers website, ""We have had boots on the ground there since last week and will continue to have a presence ... [Federal District Court Judge David Bunning] has assumed unto himself not just the powers of all three branches of government, but has also taken on the powers of judge, jury, and 'executioner.'""Earlier this year, the Oath Keepers sparked controversy after sending four armed men to Ferguson, Missouri to reportedly protect conservative writers from the website, Infowars.com. Meanwhile, Davis's attorney, Mathew Staver, has compared his client's situation to that of Jews living in Nazi Germany.""What happened in Nazi Germany, what happened there first, they removed the Jews from government public employment,"" he said in a radio interview.

A judge ruled Thursday that the criminal trial against the six officers charged in Gray's death will take place in Baltimore. ""It will be helpful, as we work to heal our city, that the public knows that jurors will be selected from the peers of the officers who work in the city, as well as Freddie Gray,"" Rawlings-Blake said of the decision.The mayor also addressed the $6.4 million wrongful death settlement awarded to Gray's family on Wednesday. The Washington Post was the first to report that city officials had determined the dollar amount.Baltimore's police union has spoken out against the settlement. The news ""threatens to interrupt any progress made toward restoring the relationship"" between cops and Baltimore’s city government, Lt. Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police, told CNN.Rawlings-Blake disagrees, and told Mitchell that the city has ""multiple interests"" that will be advanced by settling -- the primary one being to heal one of Baltimore's most recent wounds. ""The focus should be on this trial, on the criminal cases, and we've put the civil part of it behind us,"" the mayor said. ""It was important for me that we focus on the work that we're doing with the Department of Justice.""""We want to focus on that, reforming the police department, improving the relationship between the community and the police. And I didn't think it would be helped by having a protracted federal case,"" she added. Rawlings-Blake, who heads the League of Cities of the Conference of Mayors, also addressed the highly debated ""Ferguson effect,"" a theory that links protests of police violence against black people to a spike in crime. Many writers have criticized a New York Times article for describing the theory with an insufficient amount of skepticism. ""The fact that it's happening all over, you know, I think that it shows to me that this is not about Freddie Gray,"" the mayor said. ""This is a national trend in increased homicides that needs a national response."" Addressing gang violence, gun and drug control are better places to start looking for answers, she added. The money Gray’s family received is one of the largest wrongful death settlements in police death cases in recent years, according to The Associated Press. Baltimore has paid out around $5.7 million in police brutality settlements since 2011, according to a 2014 Baltimore Sun analysis. In July, New York City awarded $5.9 million to the family of Eric Garner, who was captured on video as an officer held him in a chokehold that led to his death. The officer involved was not indicted.In addition to this payout, Baltimore city police officers will be required to wear body cameras. Gray sustained a severe spinal injury after being taken into custody by Baltimore police. He died on April 19. Autopsy reports showed Gray had a single “high-energy injury,” most likely caused by a “rough ride” in the back of a police van. He was handcuffed and not secured by a seatbelt, and the injury likely occurred when the van decelerated quickly. His death was ruled a homicide, based on police failure to follow safety procedures.What happened before and after Gray’s arrest is still unclear. But the Baltimore Police Department admitted on April 24 that Gray had not received timely medical care. In May, all six officers involved in the death of Gray were charged and indicted. The officers face a range of charges. Most seriously, Caesar Goodson, the officer who drove the van used to transport Gray, is charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder, as well as manslaughter, two counts of vehicular manslaughter and second-degree assault.Officer William Porter, Sgt. Alicia White and Lt. Brian Rice face multiple charges, including involuntary manslaughter and second-degree assault. Officers Garrett Miller and Edward Nero also face charges of second-degree assault. In addition, all six officers are charged with counts of misconduct in office and reckless endangerment.Each of the officers has pleaded not guilty.Attorneys for the officers attempted to move the trial outside of Baltimore, citing fears that the case's national media coverage had tainted the jury pool. Their request was denied a day after the approval of Gray's wrongful death settlement. Rawlings-Blake acknowledged that the decision to settle the civil claim prior to a decision in the criminal case was ""unusual,"" but emphasized that it is not an indication that the city suspects the officers of wrongdoing. Protests erupted in Baltimore following Gray’s funeral on April 27. By 3 p.m. that day, dozens of teenagers showed up at Mondawmin Mall, where dozens of police officers greeted them. The Huffington Post reported from the mall, where one young woman picked up stones while officers fastened their riot helmets. The police and teenagers faced off across a narrow road off the mall's parking lot.Soon, the officers started yelling at the teenagers, instructing them to leave mall grounds. Their demands were met with chants of ""Fuck the police!"" and ""Don't shoot!"" Some of the teens could be heard saying police had ""started"" things by killing Gray.As officers' reactions began to intensify, teenagers ran to a 7-Eleven on the other side of the road -- they were upset, but still relatively peaceful.This was short-lived. Soon, the teens began throwing bricks and glass bottles at the officers.About 15 minutes after things heated up, an armored Baltimore Police Department vehicle arrived on the scene, chasing down groups of teenagers as they pelted it with rocks.Del Conley, a Baltimore resident who was involved in some of the protests, told HuffPost outside of Gray's funeral that the media has been focused on what protesters are doing wrong, and that the world should be aware of why Baltimore's residents are so upset.""People who don't live in my neighborhood or don't come from the same background as me or the same area as me -- they don't know how we live. They're outsiders looking in,"" Conley said. ""They don't know what's going on in our neighborhood. They don't know what we go through -- they don't know anything, if you ask me."""

In a letter to lawmakers, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the government was close to exhausting all of its extraordinary means for paying its obligations unless the debt ceiling was raised. The timeline was similar to the one Lew gave Congress when he last updated it on the country's monetary situation in late July. Since then, nothing has been done by Congress to a prevent the potential default. Republican leadership has stressed that it wants to avoid a showdown like the one that precipitated a crisis in the summer of 2011 and caused a downgrading in the nation's credit rating. But conservative groups have demanded that lawmakers receive either spending cuts or entitlement reforms in exchange for raising the country's borrowing limit. “Leadership constantly refers to the need to rein in mandatory spending,” said Dan Holler, the communications director for Heritage Action for America. “If they do not use the debt limit as an opportunity to enact those policies – policies that are embedded in their bicameral budget – then they have no credibility on the issue. They should use the debt limit to drive down spending, both in the near term and long term, by demanding real entitlement reform such as Medicaid block grant and Medicare premium support.” Lew, in his letter, warned that there was nothing else his department could do to prolong the deadline.  Since my previous letter, I have taken additional action to implement the extraordinary measures that allow us, on a temporary basis, to continue paying the nation's bills. Specifically, on August 31, I suspended, as necessary, the daily reinvestment of the portion of the Exchange Stabilization Fund that is invested in Treasury securities. Each of the measures employed to date is authorized by law, and each has been used during past debt limit impasses. The effective duration of these measures depends on factors that are inherently variable and irregular, including the unpredictability of tax receipts and changes in expenditure flows. If Treasury exhausts these measures, the United States will have reached the limit of its borrowing authority, and Treasury would be left to fund the government with only the cash on hand on any given day.Lew went on:As I have stated previously, extending borrowing authority does not increase government spending. It simply allows Treasury to pay for expenditures Congress has previously approved."
