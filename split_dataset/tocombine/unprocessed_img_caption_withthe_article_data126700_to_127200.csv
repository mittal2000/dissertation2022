I explained that, ""True to my Welsh namesake - The Happy One - I carefully filter the information I'm exposed to particularly prior to bedtime."" I only read stories that make me smile before I sleep. The three kittens graduated from the basement to the guest room. The move into the guest room, with an inviting bed. Photo credit: Dr. John Ryan.The latest book that I've enjoyed reading brought many smiles and good old fashion belly-laughs. It's filled with thrilling adventures and called The Saga of the Three Compañeros: Pantera, Leo and Tigre by John Ryan.Cats are mysterious animals, and unlike dogs, they basically accept people as equals as Ryan describes, ""on their own terms, which goes a long way to explain their haughty independence.""I was intrigued to learn that all cats are descendants of Felix silvestris lybica, a Near Eastern wildcat that is native to the deserts of the Middle East. It is a storied lineage dating back at least 100,000 years. Domestication of cats took place at about the same time of wheat cultivation some 10,000 years ago because these critters are exceptional mice and rat hunters. Since then countless millions of people have bonded with felines.Today in America there are over 74 million domesticated cats. Ryan lists many famous cat-loving people including President Abraham Lincoln whose cat was present during his inauguration in 1861. Other Presidents including Theodore Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Carter also brought their cats to live in the White House. ""Now where can I jump from here?"" Photo credit: Dr John Ryan,Perhaps the finest tribute to domesticated cats came from the 'Grandfather of Science,' the incomparable Renaissance genius Leonardo da Vinci who wrote ""the smallest feline is a masterpiece."" The Saga of the Three Compañeros is a captivating story about three pussycats and a charming geography professor named Dr. John Ryan. All three love to be picked up and cuddled by their Pappa - here it's Leo's turn. Photo credit: Helen Schreider.Had Ryan not been a cat-lover and an observant student of his surroundings there would be no story. Ryan recounts that the kittens' mother, Tigger, who lived next door, meowed incessantly and led him to the neighbors garage, one extremely warm July day. Moments after Ryan opened the garage door, Tigger found her kittens and they instantly started nursing. Photo credit: Dr John Ryan.It is amazing that the three kittens survived the extreme heat without food or water for days. It turned out that Tigger, her kittens and a big black Tomcat named Harley were abandoned by an erstwhile tenant in the neighbor's dwelling.Ryan was elated to have saved those kittens and made room for them and Tigger in his basement since he already had a 16-pound, highly territorial old tabby named Spice at his home.At first he was determined to find the kittens a new home once Tigger nursed them back to good health. Yet, as all pet-lovers know ""The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft agleyy"" (to borrow a famous line from Robbie Burns' poem ""To a Mouse""), especially when animal's are young and that first affectionate bond between a human and an animal forms. It was August 12, the day Ryan realized he could not bear to have these three little compañeros ever separated. Photo credit: Dr. John Ryan.Ryan found good, loving homes for both Harley and Tigger and of course he fell in love with the three compañeros.This is a touching and descriptive story about their lives outgrowing kittenhood, an enchanting grand adventure about how the three pussycats have remained the staunchest of friends. The three inseparable loving companions, comrades, compañeros, who relied on one another to face life's challenges. Photo credit: Dr. John Ryan. He named them rather easily. The female was sleek, short-haired jet black miniature panther, so he called her Pantera (Spanish for panther). The tawny buff and yellowish-brown rascal who excelled at leaping, he called Leo (after many characteristics of a lion). And the third one is El Tigre - the exotic little tiger.Once Ryan named them, they were his pussycats, as he says: ""the joy of his life."" And in the bedroom, a window with a view... of birds! Photo credit: Dr John Ryan.Interestingly, there's no alpha leader amongst them, but rather they exhibit a loving respect for one another. Moreover, they even share their food with one another. Even as kittens, if one cried out, the others would rush to the rescue. Their friendship is so endearing, as Ryan regales, that the two brothers miraculously saved their sister's life.This is a terrific book that will bring smiles and even tears of joy to your face. It is with pleasure that I bring to your attention this splendid tale with many heart-warming pussycat pictures.Earth Dr Reese Halter is a broadcaster, biologist, educator and author of The Incomparable Honeybee and the Economics of Pollination.

1,SCIENCE,NASA May Be Able To Predict Sinkholes,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nasa-sinkholes-forecast-predict-radar_us_5baebe82e4b014374e2ed838,"Though researchers are optimistic that radar imagery could pinpoint subtle land deformations, those changes may not be an",2014-03-09,"In this Thursday, June 27, 2013 photo, a truck hauling dirt rides along a berm set up to contain an approximate 22-acre sinkhole in Bayou Corne, La. Neighbors in tiny Bayou Corne face a wrenching decision after a huge sinkhole opened up near their community: Do they stay put or should they pack up and move? The sinkhole resulted from a collapsed underground salt dome cavern about 40 miles south of Baton Rouge. After oil and natural gas came oozing up and acres of swampland liquefied into muck, the community?s 350 residents were advised to evacuate. Texas Brine Co., the operator of the salt dome, is negotiating buyouts of residents who have not joined lawsuits against the company.

NASA announced this week that routine radar images could, in some cases, indicate where and when a sinkhole will form. The news follows the realization that 2012 radar data indicated the location of a massive depression before it collapsed in Louisiana, swallowing 25 acres of land. Describing the finding in the February issue of Geology, researchers said analyses of the data revealed that the ground surface layer in Bayou Corne, La., became drastically deformed at least a month before the collapse in August 2012. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) imagery obtained in June 2011 and July 2012 by one of the agency's jets showed that before the ground gave way, it rose 10 inches higher than the land around it -- a possible harbinger of impending collapse.""While horizontal surface deformations had not previously been considered a signature of sinkholes, the new study shows they can precede sinkhole formation well in advance,"" lead researcher Cathleen Jones of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a written statement. ""This kind of movement may be more common than previously thought, particularly in areas with loose soil near the surface.""Though researchers are optimistic that radar imagery could pinpoint subtle land deformations, those changes may not be an identifying factor for every sinkhole. That's why routine flyovers to obtain radar data may be more costly than they're worth. Still, the technique could be useful in specific situations. Since its collapse in 2012, the Louisiana sinkhole has continued to grow, forcing longtime residents to flee their homes. Researchers cannot stop the depression from growing, but they may be able to predict the direction of the sinkhole's next expansion by tracking surface deformations."

None was present before the 1960s in Greenland's ice cores, according to the study in the journal Nature Geoscience.That is only a small fraction of the million tonnes of CFCs produced every year at a 1980s peak, according to the team of scientists in Britain, Germany, Australia, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. LOOPHOLESLaube said it was unknown if the emissions of the new gases were illegal, since the Montreal Protocol has some exemptions. ""We hope to tighten the loopholes,"" he said.A hole in the ozone layer was found in the 1980s over Antarctica but bans on damaging chemicals, for instance used in hairsprays, foams and refrigerants, means it is on target to recover in the next 50 years.HCFCs have often been used to replace more damaging CFCs.One of the newly discovered CFCs was worrying since concentrations were rising fast, Laube said. Such emission increases had not been spotted for other CFCs since the 1990s.The gases were detected earlier in Greenland than Tasmania, indicating they were produced in the northern hemisphere and then blown south. Research planes, taking air samples around the world, may be able to find the sources, Laube said.""While these newly discovered gases can, in theory, cause some damage to the ozone layer, their combined abundance is over 500 times smaller than that of the main ozone-destroying compounds in the 1990s,"" said Martyn Chipperfield, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Leeds.""These new observations do not present concern at the moment, although the fact that these gases are in the atmosphere and some are increasing needs investigation,"" he said.Laube said the gases are also likely to be powerful greenhouse gases, albeit in tiny amounts. CFCs are often thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. (Reporting By Alister Doyle; Editing by Mike Collett-White)"

Newborns have died in incubators because of power cuts and parents have administered intravenous drips to their children because there was not enough medical staff to help them.Patients have died from receiving wrong blood types, and transfusions have in some places been performed directly between people because of a lack of power, according to the report.The report quoted the Syrian American Medical Society as estimating that, since the start of the conflict, 200,000 Syrians had died from chronic illnesses because of a lack of access to treatment and drugs. POLIO RESURGENCESyria's vaccination coverage has also been hit hard. Before the war, coverage was 91 percent, but fell to 68 percent just a year after the conflict's start, and is probably much lower now, the report said.Measles and meningitis have spread, and polio - which the report said was eradicated across Syria in 1995 - has now infected up to 80,000 children, it added.""The breakdown of Syria's vaccination programme has resulted in the re-emergence of polio in Syria,"" it said.""Children born after 2010 have not been vaccinated for two years. There have been heavy restrictions in access to vaccines and health workers have not been able to reach children in need.""Factors including overcrowding and poor living conditions, water and sanitation have meant skin diseases including Leishmaniasis - a parasitic disease caused by the bite of the sandfly - have increased.There were fewer than 3,000 cases before the war, and now there are more than 100,000.Save the Children called for humanitarian groups to be given freedom of access to all areas and aid to be allowed across conflict lines, after ceasefires if necessary.""Immediate investment in, and access to, child-focused health services is needed to ensure that children are not dying from preventable and treatable injuries and illnesses,"" it said.
