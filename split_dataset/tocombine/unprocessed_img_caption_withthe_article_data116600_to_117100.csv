0,POLITICS,Washington State Is Low On Weed For Retail Marijuana Debut,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/washington-marijuana-supply_n_5552962.html,,2014-07-03,"SEATTLE, WA - APRIL 20: Anthony Nitowski smokes two joints outside at Hempfest on April 20, 2014 in Seattle, Washington. Seattle Hempfest is an annual event for the purpose of educating the public about the benefits of marijuana and advocating for its decriminalization. (Photo by Meg Roussos/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cebf1f00000002257263.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Washington state's new recreational marijuana shops will open next week for the first time to legally sell marijuana to adults. But there's a problem: They're low on weed.""Supply is going to be tight as this market launches,"" said Brian Smith, communications director for the state Liquor Control Board --the agency charged with regulating the nascent retail marijuana market. ""This is an emerging market that doesn't exist anywhere in the world. It's a lot different than Colorado. And just like Colorado did when it first opened up, it had some shortages, but Washington's supply system is very robust and in a little bit of time all those suppliers will be feeding into the retail chain and there will be a lot.""The LCB will issue the first retail marijuana business licenses on Monday to about 20 outlets, Smith said. That gives the new pot shops about 24 hours to enter their cannabis inventory into the state's seed-to-sale marijuana tracking system so they can open for business on Tuesday. ""We've been looking at population and geography on where retail shops' locations,"" Smith told The Huffington Post. ""We've moved maybe 30 forward, but not all of them are going to be ready come next week. We'd like to open several in Seattle, considering it's the big city, but it's going to be difficult come Tuesday.""Seattle's Cannabis City, which may be the only marijuana shop in the city opening on Tuesday, will have about 10 pounds of pot, owner James Lathrop said. ""We''ll be selling in the $15 to $20 range per gram,"" Lathrop told HuffPost. ""We expect to sell out that day."" Lathrop is probably right. In Colorado, which began allowing recreational pot sales Jan. 1, several of the nearly 40 shops around the state ran low or completely sold out of their supply in the early days at $10 to $20 per gram.Top Shelf Cannabis, in Bellingham -- in the northwest corner of the state about 90 miles from Seattle -- has secured about 18 pounds of marijuana for its opening day on Tuesday. ""There's a supply and demand issue right now and people can charge whatever they want, but if you charge too much we're going to ruin this industry,"" John Evich, an investor in Top Shelf, told HuffPost. ""We're planning on selling our product for about $12 to $25 per gram."" Both shop owners told HuffPost they plan to sell marijuana in two-gram amounts, hoping to supply any customers who want to be part of the state's first day of legalization.Retail cannabis growers in Washington were allowed to bring plants to be tagged and registered with the state tracking system two weeks after receiving state licenses. The first licenses weren't issued until March. The state's LCB has approved about 79 licenses for marijuana producers and processors.In November 2013, the LCB opened the application process for retail marijuana businesses. Unsurprisingly, there was a flood. ""We had a 30-day window beginning Nov. 20 and [the applications] just poured in,"" Smith recalled. ""We received somewhere in the neighborhood of 7,000 applications.""The Liquor Control Board has stopped accepting applications and capped the number of recreational marijuana shops at 334. But just as in Colorado, there are dozens of local bans and moratoriums on recreational marijuana shops across the state, so it may take some time for all those state-allotted retail outlets to open.Colorado and Washington were the first U.S. states to approve adult-use marijuana in 2012. Colorado's first retail marijuana shops opened in January to long lines and high sales. In the first week, Colorado shops collectively raked in more than $5 million. To date, with more than 100 shops now open, recreational marijuana retailers have generated sales of about $70 million.Washington sales are regulated by the Liquor Control Board, while Colorado is regulated by the Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division, which monitored the state medical marijuana industry prior to recreational legalization. In Washington, marijuana producers and processors cannot also be retailers. In Colorado, retailers can also be growers. Until this month, retail shops in Colorado had to have been a medical marijuana dispensary in ""good standing"" with the state prior to being allowed to make recreational sales. Now, the state is accepting applications for marijuana businesses from newcomers. In Washington, anyone could apply for a recreational marijuana business license. The approximately 20 retailers that will open on July 8 are not former medical marijuana shops."
1,POLITICS,GOP Establishment Keeps Promise To Counter Tea Party With Surge In Primary Spending,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-establishment-spending_n_5552753.html,,2014-07-03,"Elephants fight at the Elephant National Park in Addo, South Africa, Friday, July 9, 2010. The first soccer World Cup on the African continent is on its way since June 11. (AP Photo/Fernando Vergara)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cebd200000f90101d081.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Republican Party's internecine conflict has sparked a surge in independent spending in GOP congressional primaries as establishment elements defend incumbents against tea party-linked challengers.Total spending by independent groups (excluding those known for supporting Democrats) in contested Republican congressional primaries soared to $46 million by the end of June, according to a review of Federal Election Commission records by The Huffington Post. That tops the $33 million spent in GOP congressional primaries during the full 2012 election calendar.The spending surge came after the GOP establishment blamed the party's failure to capture control of the Senate on undisciplined tea party-backed candidates, who won primaries with the support of insurgent independent groups, then lost the general election to Democrats. Spending by corporate business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and wealthy establishment donors, is a reversal from recent elections that featured tea party groups as the largest source of independent spending in primaries.   Scott Reed, the senior political strategist at the chamber, which did not respond to a request for comment, told Bloomberg in October, ""The need is now more than ever to elect people who understand the free market and not silliness.""The Chamber of Commerce emerged this election cycle as the biggest spender in GOP primaries, dropping $6.9 million on contested races. Nearly all of this spending was in contests where tea party-backed candidates challenged incumbents or where incumbents wanted to scare off potential challenges. It's the first time the chamber has spent significant sums in primary elections.The epicenter of the mainstream GOP spending surge was Mississippi, where Sen. Thad Cochran won a primary runoff last month against tea party-backed state Sen. Chris McDaniel. The chamber was the second-biggest pro-Cochran force, spending $1.2 million and contributing $100,000 to the Mississippi Conservatives super PAC that spent $1.8 million in support of the incumbent.Late in the three-week runoff campaign, the chamber crafted a key advertisement featuring former NFL quarterback Brett Favre, a Gulfport, Mississippi, native, endorsing Cochran for securing funds that helped the state recover from Hurricane Katrina.The business group also spent big on Senate races in Kentucky and North Carolina, and House races in Idaho, Ohio and North Carolina. All involved internal GOP clashes. The Chamber backed business-friendly Rep. Jack Kingston in the open Georgia Senate race, where he faces the similarly pro-business David Purdue in a runoff, and spent money in less contentious Senate primaries in Iowa and Alaska.Other corporate trade associations supported establishment incumbents, mostly in the same races as the chamber. These groups, including the American Hospital Association and the National Association of Realtors, spent nearly $3.2 million on primary races in the 2014 midterms.A number of groups tied to establishment Republican operatives and donors also intervened in primary elections. Ending Spending Action Fund, the super PAC founded by TD Ameritrade founder and Chicago Cubs owner Joe Ricketts and run by his son, Todd, has been active in opposing tea party-linked candidates. The group spent $1.2 million in the Georgia Senate race against Rep. Phil Gingrey, who was criticized as a potential liability if he won the nomination.The super PAC also poured money into a failed effort to defeat Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.), a populist conservative who attracted enmity for bucking party leadership with his hardline anti-government spending, anti-war and anti-Wall Street stances. Ending Spending Action Fund spent more than $700,000 to defeat Jones after receiving equivalent contributions from hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer, a leading Jones opponent.For years, Singer has been an insider party donor, supporting candidates who back Israel and aggressive neoconservative foreign policy positions. Since the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision and the deaths of top party donors Bob Perry and Harold Simmons, Singer has cemented himself as a leading funder of the party establishment.Beyond opposing Jones in North Carolina, Singer's American Unity PAC spent more than $660,000 to promote Rep. Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.), in the incumbent's challenge from anti-gay marriage Assemblywoman Claudia Tenney. Singer supports same-sex marriage and founded American Unity PAC to back candidates like Hanna, who are marriage equality supporters.Another super PAC funded by Singer, New York 2014, spent more than $370,000 to support former Bush administration staffer Elise Stefanik's winning primary campaign for an open seat in New York's 21st Congressional District. Singer donated $100,000 to the group and was joined by other billionaire donors, including Ken Griffin and Cliff Asness.Stefanik's campaign also was backed by American Crossroads, the super PAC founded by Karl Rove and the central node in the GOP establishment's independent network. Prior to 2014, American Crossroads stayed out of Republican primary campaigns. But after Senate election losses in 2010 and 2012 that it ascribed to tea party-backed candidates' incendiary comments on rape and race, the group sought to fight back. An announcement early last year of this plan, dubbed the Conservative Victory Project, created a furor among hard-right conservatives, and ultimately failed to raise money.American Crossroads did, however, intervene in contested Senate primaries in Mississippi and North Carolina, and to support Stefanik in New York. In Mississippi and North Carolina, the group contributed funds to locally based super PACs supporting Cochran and North Carolina Assembly leader Thom Tillis, who won a primary race against a candidate supported by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).Despite the defense mounted by the business lobbies and the GOP establishment, Republican policy positions do not appear to be softening. The Chamber of Commerce's support for immigration reform and the renewal of the Export-Import Bank have gained no traction with party leaders.In fact, Republicans have moved closer to the tea party insurgent groups on both immigration and the Export-Import Bank this year. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) ended all hope for a vote on immigration reform this week, and renewal of the bank depends on whether Boehner will allow a vote with only minority support from House Republicans.The top-spending insurgent groups -- Club for Growth, Senate Conservatives Fund, FreedomWorks and Tea Party Patriots -- pumped $11 million into Republican primaries and helped candidates win nominations in open primary contests, even though they lost high-profile races. Some key races remain where their contributions may protect incumbents they helped elect in the past two cycles or may help elect like-minded lawmakers in open-seat races.Support from these insurgent groups, though, wasn't a factor in the biggest primary upset of 2014. The shocking loss of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) to college professor David Brat came without big financial support from tea party groups. The only incumbent to lose an election to an opponent backed by GOP insurgent groups was Rep. Ralph Hall (R-Texas), 91, the oldest member of Congress.In spite of the GOP divisions, the Republican establishment and the GOP insurgents backed the same candidates in some races. In Alaska, Senate candidate Dan Sullivan is supported by American Crossroads, the chamber and Club for Growth. In Iowa, Joni Ernst won the Republican Senate nomination with backing from the chamber and Senate Conservatives Fund."
2,POLITICS,The White House Had A Plan To Help The Long-Term Jobless. How's It Going?,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/long-term-unemployment_n_5552609.html,,2014-07-03,"President Barack Obama speaks about job training, Thursday, Jan. 30, 2014, at General Electric's Waukesha, Wis. gas engine plant. The trip is part of a four-stop tour President Barack Obama is making to expand themes from his State of the Union address. (AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ceb6210000d601c9627d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- At the beginning of the year, the White House trumpeted its effort to get business leaders to hire the long-term unemployed. ""I've been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families,"" President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address. ""This week, many will come to the White House to make that commitment real.""More than 300 companies signed a pledge that they wouldn't avoid hiring anyone just because of a long jobless spell. Studies have shown that long-term unemployment has become its own obstacle to getting hired. In June, the Labor Department announced Thursday, there were 3.1 million Americans out of work six months or longer, down 293,000 from May and a million from this time last year -- but still a historically unprecedented number. When Congress let long-term unemployment insurance die in December, it left the federal government with no policy that specifically targets the problem of prolonged joblessness. Administration officials never said the business pledge would fill that gap and meaningfully reduce long-term joblessness; they just suggested it couldn't hurt. So what's up with the pledge lately? Not a whole lot -- though the administration says it's a work in progress. HuffPost asked White House economic adviser Betsey Stevenson about the effort during a recent Capitol Hill event on long-term unemployment. ""We definitely see that as an ongoing process -- staying in touch with these companies, finding out what works, what didn’t work,"" Stevenson said. She also touted the administration's new $150 million ""Ready to Work"" grant program for new public-private partnerships that could reconnect unemployed Americans with jobs. The pledge outlines some best practices for companies' human resources departments, which include avoiding anything that would discourage the long-term jobless from seeking positions and any internal barriers to considering their applications. Walmart and McDonald's, the two biggest companies that signed the pledge, had no comment for this story. Another senior administration official told HuffPost that the White House is ""working with outside partners to follow up on the best practices and determine successes as a result of the implementation of these practices as well as more detailed guidance for businesses on implementing the best practices.""Meanwhile, long-term unemployment is still terrible. While a person's financial situation steadily deteriorates, so does that individual's physical and mental health. And the decline in the number of people jobless six months or longer is not necessarily great news. A Brookings Institution report found earlier this year that among people who'd been long-term unemployed from 2008 through 2012, about one third found jobs and one third gave up their search."

In a statement, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said:“As the President emphasized in his Climate Action Plan, it is critical that we take an all-of-the above approach to energy in order to cut carbon pollution, help address the effects of climate change and protect our children’s future. Investments in clean, low-carbon energy also provide an economic opportunity. Through previous loan guarantees and other investments, the Department is already helping launch or jumpstart entire industries in the U.S., from utility-scale wind and solar to nuclear and lower-carbon fossil energy. Today’s announcement will help build on and accelerate that success.” The Department highlighted several key technologies it anticipates will receive loans, including hydroelectric dams and drop-in biofuels. Last month, Obama announced new rules for power plants meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ThinkProgress also notes several other DOE announcements to fund green energy projects. The efforts are a step in the right direction, but some climate scientists say it might be too late. Michael Oppenheimer, a scientist at Princeton University, told Scientific American that ""marginal cuts by the U.S. don't have a long-term overall big effect on the climate. What has to happen to have a big effect on the global climate is for all the big emitters to get together and decide that they are all going to cut some substantial fraction.""Earlier this week, Climate Central reported that June was the third month in a row where carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere topped an average of 400 parts per million. This is the longest amount of time in recorded history that CO2 levels have been this high. "

For a complete record of his previous posts, visit his author page, and to follow along with the rest of his reflections, sign up for an author email alert above, visit his Facebook page or follow him on Twitter.Yesterday morning, a young Palestinian boy named Muhammed Abu Khdeir was kidnapped, stabbed, and burned to death. e had left his home early in the morning to have a meal with his friends before dawn struck and the time for fasting would begin. For a few brief moments, he was left alone and at that time was grabbed and forced into a car against his will, driven then to his eventual demise. I shudder as I think of what happened next and tremble at the image my mind concocts what must have been done to this poor boy that caused his remains to be the charred body found a short while later in the depths of the Jerusalem Forest. He was only 15 years old. May God grant him peace and bring ease to the hearts of his family and loved ones. Ameen. I am not sure why, but all I wanted to see was this young man's face. I wanted to see his eyes and the ambition and aspiration that existed within them. I wanted to see his smile and the fact that he had family and friends that he celebrated with. I wanted to see his youthfulness and bear witness that he had an entire life ahead of him to live. I wanted to tie a person to the prayers that I was making for with my community as we broke our fast with tears falling from our eyes and our hands raised to the skies in supplication to The Most Merciful of those who show mercy. But no images were to be found in any article or story that covered his murder, not of him or his family members or anyone stricken by grief over his death. Every and any outlet that in the days prior had showed us, the entire world, the turmoil and anguish that was felt at the loss of Eyal Yifrah, Gilad Shaar, and Naftali Fraenkel, three other young men who were killed senselessly in the same land, failed to show us anything similar when it came to Muhammed Abu Khdeir. What is the difference between them? Why am I not seeing the face of an anguished Palestinian mother who has to bear the burden of burying her 15-year old son? A mother who has to come to terms with the fact that she will never feel his warm embrace again, will never get to feed him by her own gentle hand again, will not get to give up sleep to prepare an iftar meal for him to break his fast, or watch him grow into the man she knew he would always be? Why do I not even know her name? Why am I not seeing the grief-stricken face of a father who has to deal with the reality of outliving his son? A father who will never get to see his son graduate from school, will never get to stand in prayer with him again in one of the holiest cities in the world, who will not be able to wake him because there are only minutes left to eat something before sunrise, or see him become a father of his own children? And how come we don't know his name either? Why is that in every piece written from the NY Times to CNN on Muhammed Abu Khdeir, all that is shown are images of soldiers fighting civilians? No tears, no sorrow, no grief to empathize with. Just images that add to the overt otherizing of a people that feel pain just like any other people would. Images that justify our own passivity to a real conflict that is taking place that all of our hearts should feel torn apart by. Images that make us numb to the reality that there are actual lives tied to the thousands of casualties of this conflict. Each one has a name and a narrative, including young Muhammed Abu Khdeir. He lived in the same land as Eyal Yifrah, Gilad Shaar, and Naftali Fraenkel, was the same age as them, and lost his life senselessly just as they did. Why do we not get to see him? Some articles are not even mentioning his name. They are just referring to him as ""a young, Palestinian teen."" His life, his Palestinian life, and the lives of countless others whose stories we will never hear, are just as important and we have a duty to sanctify each one. For those whose insides ache as mine do, below is an image of young Muhammed. Take a look at it and let it be imprinted on your soul. Keep Muhammed Abu Khdeir, his loved ones, and the people of Palestine in your prayers. For those who are observing the month of Ramadan, remember all of them as you break your fast and stand in qiyaam during these blessed nights. "

A new report in Foreign Policy outlines a hawks' ""playbook"" circulating in the U.S. Congress that advocates maintaining key sanctions even after a potential nuclear deal, until Iran ceases to be a ""sponsor of terror."" In May the White House scrambled to scuttle the proposed Corker Amendment to the Israel-U.S. Strategic Partnership Act, whereby Congress would have had to directly approve any nuclear deal with Iran. For those opposed to a final deal, not least in the U.S., the Iranian polity is simply not sophisticated enough to be reasoned with, so only vivid demonstration will suffice to show what is and isn't acceptable. Nuance, negotiation, and reciprocity are out. Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, has even taken to the pages of the Washington Post to call for a ""sober appreciation of realities ... and a serious calculation of alternatives."" And he does not hesitate to point out that the aggressive posturing of the past has driven the nuclear program from 200 to 20,000 centrifuges, nor to imply that this only strengthens the hand of those elements in Iran that are most opposed to detente and most radical. In fact, these elements in Iran thrive not just on opposition to the current negotiations but on conflict itself. The hawk position in the U.S. Congress is the corollary of an argument that has dogged the Islamic Republic since its inception, the argument that, as a relatively young polity, Iran is simply too lacking in political history, tradition and heritage, or, in psychological terms, the coping mechanisms, to survive too much political convulsion. This alleged inherent weakness could be used equally to explain the state's frequent turns to violence, most recently in 2009, and its potential instability going forward.One response to this argument is Said Arjomand's thesis, according to which the Islamic Revolution goes further than other ""political religions"" (e.g., the French Revolution, fascism, communism, and so on) by not just referencing a mythologized past but incorporating it wholesale, laying claim to and internalizing the heritage, traditions and legitimacy of centuries of Islam, in particular Shiism. The net effect has been a unique and powerful resilience. Both arguments operate on similar intellectual terrain but arrive at quite different conclusions.An alternative paradigm, however, might be to extend this personification and developmental perspective a bit further to try to understand not just the viability but the actual behavior of the regime.In this view, the coping mechanisms -- the habits and basic adaptability of the polity -- are shaped in early experience. The more traumatic the early experience, the more extreme and entrenched are likely to be the coping mechanisms. And just as an individual may carry such coping mechanisms into later life and different contexts, sometimes with disastrous effects, so may a polity.The traumatic youth of the Islamic Republic in Iran would be the brutal international isolation of the Iran-Iraq War, instigated by Saddam's invasion not 18 months after the Republic was founded. Through the war, Iran endured ceasefire resolutions that did not call for a return to pre-hostilities borders until Iran had crossed into Iraq. It endured global material and diplomatic support for the enemy, including components for chemical weaponry and gas attacks that went unrecognized and unquestioned by the international community. And it had a civilian airliner shot out of the sky by a U.S. warship, which then simply denied culpability. (The U.S. government eventually paid blood money in 1996, some nine years later.) The coping mechanism became a political program that is still heavily premised on the identification and confrontation of an external threat, building on themes that predated and informed the revolution, but with a whole new relevance. This occurred to the detriment of other social, political and economic objectives, taking their place, to some extent, at least, as a source of legitimacy. The existential nature, duration and totality of the war lent validity to such a program: Those who could most successfully resist would save the nation.Some could argue that this posturing has little to do with war and descends rather from Shia Islam, a mode of thought burned into the national psyche. Certainly veneration of the Imam Hussein and the glorification of resistance and self-sacrifice have high cultural purchase in Iran. But it is not easy to define yourself through a culture of resistance if others do not oppose you, or, at the very least, are prepared to extend to you the basic norms of international relations and warfare. These were brutally absent in the world's relations with Iran during the war with Iraq. In short, the life of the Islamic Republic until, say, 1990, had been brutish and short. And this is how the head of the nascent body-politic became so heavily invested in an adversarial identity, so dependent on international tension and the perception of a state under siege. It is in the casually xenophobic political chants (""Death to America!"") that are still officially promoted, in the constant political idiom of ""enemies,"" in the readiness to provoke international censure and undermine international economic linkages, as necessary.The rest of the body-politic is better able to adapt beyond past circumstances. It responds to its changing needs. The head, conversely, bears the burden of authority. It must justify itself, to a greater or lesser extent, in its exercise. And so it clings to the role and identity that gave it its greatest legitimacy and greatest triumph, even though, in doing so, it may wreak havoc on its own people.The lesson learned by the Islamic Republic during eight years of war was that confrontation with an external enemy could be dramatically exploited to consolidate and justify power. They had learned, like Thomas Hobbes, that it was the condition of war that justified and fed the Leviathan.The trick from the outside, then, may be in finding out how best to starve the beast rather than the people. Contrary to the arguments against the current round of talks, it is exactly nuance, negotiation and reciprocity that pose the greatest challenges to this adversarial identity. In fact, they pose a threat to all those who have sought to derive authority from the current tension and conflict, which may go some way toward explaining much of the criticism."
