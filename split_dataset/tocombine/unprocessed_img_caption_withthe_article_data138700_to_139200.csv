According to ATPworldtour.com, his passport, money and his Rosary that was blessed by Pope Francis earlier this year were among the items taken from del Potro. The 2009 U.S. Open champion said the Rosary is what mattered most to him. ""I was finishing the check-in and was asked for an autograph. I turned around to sign it and within 20 seconds, it was stolen,"" via USA Today Sports. Del Potro arrived in London later on Saturday and was placed in Group B with Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Richard Gasquet, per Tennis.com. ""It was an incredible experience with Pope Francis, something that I'll never forget,” said del Potro when he met Pope Francis in Rome back in May, via ATPworldtour.com. “It was a dream come true for a guy like me. It was an unforgettable moment. I was very nervous before meeting him, to be able to congratulate him and talk with him. He was nice. Everybody knows he is very humble. Today was a day that I'll remember for ever.""CORRECTION: The previous version of this story falsely stated that del Potro's U.S. Open trophy and Olympic medal were stolen as well.  "
1,PARENTING,What Do I Tell My Daughter About Ender's Game?,"Seth Taylor, Contributor
Teacher and Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-do-i-tell-my-daughter-about-enders-game_us_5b9da1a6e4b03a1dcc8a8166,"How do I pass along one of my favorite childhood treasures, knowing that it was authored by someone whose beliefs are truly ugly to me?",2013-11-01,"This image released by Summit Entertainment shows Ben Kingsley, left, and Asa Butterfield in a scene from ""Ender's Game."" (AP Photo/Summit Entertainment, Richard Foreman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9da1a62200008300d9b536.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I find myself in a bit of a pop culture dilemma this week.When I was 15 or so, I read Orson Scott Card's science fiction masterwork, Ender's Game. As a sci-fi geek from way back, I was predisposed to love the story of a young boy on a future Earth, recruited by the military to learn how to fight a looming alien invasion. The story was simple and elegant, the writing crisp and vivid, and the book rocked my socks. I read it several times. The last time was only a few years ago. I'm 43 now.Last fall, I read a press release announcing that Hollywood was finally making an Ender's Game movie. I proceeded to have an immediate nerdgasm.But shortly after the movie announcement was released to the far corners of the Internet, I started seeing more news stories, unexpected ones, about Card himself, and the fact that he's widely reputed to be a major bigot. More specifically: a big-time homophobe. Thanks to the magic of the Internet, several articles and statements have emerged since then, all authored by Card over the years. In a 1990 article, Card postulated about the dangerous ""homosexual agenda."" In 2004, he claimed that gay people are the result of child abuse and molestation, and that gay marriage will never count as ""real marriage."" And in 2008, he wrote an article for the Mormon Times, arguing that gay marriage will result in the end of American democracy. There's more. There's a lot more. Go Googling and see. But that was enough for this sci-fi fan (and newly out gay guy) to bum hard. And I didn't feel any better when I saw that a couple months ago, Card spoke out again (in an exclusive comment to Entertainment Weekly, no less) about his previous statements, essentially throwing up his hands in surrender:Ender's Game is set more than a century in the future and has nothing to do with political issues that did not exist when the book was written in 1984. With the recent Supreme Court ruling, the gay marriage issue becomes moot. The Full Faith and Credit clause of the Constitution will, sooner or later, give legal force in every state to any marriage contract recognized by any other state. Now it will be interesting to see whether the victorious proponents of gay marriage will show tolerance toward those who disagreed with them when the issue was still in dispute.Of course. In my imagination, I picture Card getting phone calls from studio execs, saying, ""Dude: we need you to do some backpedaling stat before this movie comes out."" And this was Card's best effort.I know how to separate reality from fiction. With a few exceptions (I'm lookin' at you, Chris Brown and Mel Gibson), I'm usually able to appreciate a piece of entertainment for what it is, without letting my perspective be tainted by a less-than-savory backstory about the creator.But this just makes me sad. See, I LOVE Ender's Game. I remember visualizing the main character so clearly: Ender Wiggin, the boy taken away from his family, isolated in interstellar Battle School, and forced to become a genius at the game of war. I already have a copy of the book ready for my daughter to read as soon as I think she might be interested. How do I do this, though? How do I pass along one of my favorite childhood treasures, knowing that it was authored by someone whose beliefs are truly ugly to me?We're not talking about some random novelist crouching in a dim corner of the Geek Literature basement. For many fans my age, Card is the J.K. Rowling of science fiction. What if you found out the creator of your beloved Harry Potter was, let's say, a big racist? I still think Ender's Game is an amazing book. And I know my daughter will love it. I also know that if she finds out about Card's homophobic beliefs, she'll refuse to read it. (She's very protective of her gay dad that way.) Do I tell her about Card? Do I let her enjoy the book for a while and then tell her? And in a more immediate sense, what if she asks to go see the movie this weekend?While I can't picture myself withholding the book from her (my old copy is still on our bookshelf), I could boycott the film. Not that I think Card himself will feel any big hurt from my measly ten-dollar protest. Not that I think studios will learn a valuable lesson. But because it might make me feel just a little bit better. On the other hand, I'm so curious about the movie. I want to see it.This may not seem like a big decision to some people. Maybe I should just get over myself and let my girl read and see what she wants. But the thing is, I've discovered that one of my favorite childhood writers thinks I'm an abomination. And I'm just not sure what to do with that.As my daughter gets older, she'll learn that sometimes, great works of entertainment come from less-than-great people, and she'll decide for herself when she is and isn't able to separate Art from Artist. Ender's Game opens in theaters nationwide this weekend, and I may have a Teachable Moment on my hands. I'm just not quite sure how I'll handle it.An earlier version of this post was originally published at DadCentric.com.Also on HuffPost:"
2,HOME & LIVING,Americans Flee The Northeast Because It's The Northeast,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americans-fleeing-northeast_us_5b9da3d7e4b03a1dcc8a97ff,A study released earlier this year showed that New Jersey had the highest ratio of people moving out compared to those moving,2013-11-01,"The lower Manhattan skyline is dominated by One World Trade Tower in New York, Monday, Oct. 28, 2013. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9da3d7240000510053aba7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's true that the Northeast is home to some of the priciest zip codes in the country and some of the harshest winters ever, but the question of why Americans are abandoning the area specifically for places like Virginia, North Dakota and Texas, leaves some experts perplexed.According to the New York Post, the exodus is not puzzling at all. In fact, it's been going on for decades.The movement from high-tax, high-housing-cost states to low-tax, low-housing-cost states has been going on for more than 40 years ... From 1970 to 2010, the population of New York state rose from 18 million to 19 million. In that same period, the population of Texas grew from 11 million to 25 million.A study released earlier this year showed that New Jersey had the highest ratio of people moving out compared to those moving in, with 62 percent of the moves logged heading out. Other Northeast states with the largest number of people moving out included, New York (58 percent), Maine (56 percent) and Connecticut (56 percent). One camp says that despite high scores on the ""opportunity index,"" a ranking of metropolitan areas where young adults are most likely to rise from the bottom to the top of the income scale, the cost of housing in the Northeast is ultimately forcing people out.According to Washington Monthly writer Timothy Noah:Why are Americans by and large moving away from economic opportunity rather than toward it? ... One “push” factor heavily touted by conservatives is state income taxes ... A far more plausible push factor is the cost of housing.But others disagree. ""Contrary to Noah’s inference, people don’t move away from opportunity. They move partly in response to economic incentives, but also to pursue dreams and escape nightmares,"" the Post notes. ""When you adjust incomes for tax rates and cost of living, Texas comes out ahead of California and New York and ranks behind only Virginia and Washington state.""Still others present another reason: age. As Forbes' noted earlier this year, ""The Northeast and Midwest also feature a comparatively high concentration of residents over 65 who tend to retire to states that are warmer and less expensive.""Check out more of Noah's theory in the November/December issue of Washington Monthly and an analysis of his claim at the New York Post.
