President Obama proposed raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 an hour during his State of the Union address last week. While many on the right say that raising the minimum wage could make it more difficult for employers to hire people and therefore cause higher unemployment, Krugman argued in his post that this simply is not the case. ""There just isnâ€™t any evidence that raising the minimum wage near current levels would reduce employment,"" Krugman wrote, citing a report by John Schmitt from the Center for Economic Policy and Research. This opinion is a hotly contested one. A 2011 study from the London School of Economics found that higher minimum wages do correlate with an increase in unemployment.That said, there are a number of ways the labor market could respond to an increase in the minimum wage that do not involve cutting jobs. The Washington Post's Wonkblog has a great summary of these effects, which you can check out here. The federal minimum wage hasn't increased since 2009. According to a 2012 study from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, the minimum wage would actually be $21.72 an hour if it kept pace with increases in worker productivity.The same CEPR study found that if the minimum wage kept up with inflation since it peaked in real value in 1968, it would now be $10.52 per hour.Even if the U.S. raised the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour, the nation would still have a lower minimum wage than many countries around the world.

So what's better for low-wage workers: an increase in the minimum wage or a decrease in payroll taxes?",2013-02-17,"President Barack Obama pauses during his speech at Hyde Park Academy on Friday, Feb. 15, 2013, in Chicago. Obama is traveling to promote the economic and educational plan he laid out in his State of the Union address. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e8e120000030000011d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My son is a low-wage worker, a short-order cook. President Obama just called for an increase in the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $9.00 an hour. Yet he made no effort to save the ""temporary stimulus"" 2% payroll tax cut, which expired at the end of 2012. That will cost workers like my son about a week's gross pay over a year -- not insignificant when you're barely scraping by. So what's better for low-wage workers: an increase in the minimum wage or a decrease in payroll taxes?Although my son went to culinary school and trained as a pastry chef, he has been unable to find work paying more than nine or ten dollars an hour, and not full time either. Typically, when volume slows, his bosses send him home; he's lucky to get 30 hours a week. Those bosses--small business owners of restaurant franchises--also struggle to survive. Hurricane Sandy flooded out my son's last employer.Conservatives claim that a minimum wage increase will cause job loss. Jared Bernstein disagrees. He cites studies showing that a modest increase in the minimum wage, one that only affects a few percent of workers, won't increase unemployment rates. Minimum wages, he says, also set a standard when there's a range of possible wages. I agree with Bernstein. However, speaking from my son's experience, there may be a reason why most studies show little effect: employers often cheat by paying employees for fewer hours than they actually work. The nominal wage may go up, but the effective wage remains the same.Payroll taxes aren't so benign. That's especially true for small businesses like my son's employers, where staff payroll is the biggest cost. The minimum wage, nominally at least, only affects the division of revenue between employer and employee. Payroll taxes take a big bite out of the total revenue before it's divided. In 2013, Social Security takes 12.4% for wages up to a $113,700 cap. There's another 2.9% for Medicare, with no cap. Then there are tax nibbles for Federal and local unemployment and disability. The Affordable Care Act will add further costs. Regardless of the exact share as between boss and worker, payroll taxes encourage workers to drop out, and employers to hire fewer workers and squeeze them harder, or to automate, or simply to fail. Besides taxes, other costs loom extra-large for low-wage workers. My son, who lives with his girlfriend and their child on Long Island, now commutes to a job in Manhattan. He pays $250 a month for a rail pass and walks fifteen blocks to the restaurant to save subway fare. That $250 alone comes to a quarter of his monthly gross of about $1000. Why does he do it? Why not hang out at home, taking odd jobs off the books? Why? My son takes great pride in his restaurant expertise, and greater pride in supporting his family and paying taxes like a good middle-class American. He doesn't even spend the allowance I give him; he's saving it up for his son.The proposed federal minimum wage increase will at best benefit a small number of workers, and only until inflation wipes out the real value of the increase. If President Obama really wants to help the working poor, he should propose to mitigate payroll taxes. There are two obvious ways. First, lower the rates--making up the difference by extending the tax to all income beyond the $113,700 cap. Second increase the Earned Income Tax Credit for low wage workers. Both changes would make the tax system more progressive and less destructive."

All the real-life Pats and Tiffanys out there need to know that no one has to be alone in life and silver linings do exist.,2013-02-17,"LOS ANGELES, CA - JANUARY 27: Actress Jennifer Lawrence accepts the award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role for 'Silver Linings Playbook' onstage during the 19th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards held at The Shrine Auditorium on January 27, 2013 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Mark Davis/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb41787200000e800005a0e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I found out my debut novel, The Silver Linings Playbook, was going to be made into a major motion picture, I was thrilled to the point of speechlessness.The movie theater has always been a sacred place, ever since my father and grandfather used to take me when I was just a boy. Hundreds -- maybe even thousands -- of times I have been transformed in dark rooms as stories glow larger-than-life before me. Each time -- as I left the movies, often feeling lighter, better, somehow healed -- I secretly wondered if someday a story of mine and maybe even my name might shine brightly on screens across the world. Could I contribute somehow to the medium that had saved me time and time again?Once that dream became a reality, I wondered what would become of my story -- one that was very personal, full of characters I loved like family, and about a subject near and dear to my heart. Letting go emotionally was an act of faith.David O. Russell is a storytelling hero of mine. So when he became attached, I knew my novel was in good hands. The night before The Weinstein Company screened Silver Linings for me in Tribeca, David and I talked at length. Then we continued the conversation after I had seen the film. He seemed really interested in my opinion, and I came to believe his concern stemmed from a great respect for the source material and subject matter. I've had the opportunity to watch the film in the same theater with David and see him react to the audience's response. Like all great storytellers, he cares deeply for his characters and their stories. David has discussed his motivation for making this film -- he wanted to tell a story that would make his son feel like part of the world. Talking with people all over the country who have seen Silver Linings, I can easily say David's adaptation has made an extraordinary amount of people feel less alone.A few weeks ago, I sat in the front row of Katie Couric's show, as Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, David, and Patrick Kennedy discussed The Silver Linings Playbook and mental health issues. The conversation was riveting and emotional. When the taping finished, Robert De Niro walked directly over to me, shook my hand, looked me in the eye, and gave me a nod. When perhaps the greatest living actor does this, it feels weighty. I might even use the word fatherly. I don't know for sure what Mr. De Niro was trying to convey. Even if he was merely being polite, the gesture was not lost on me. I'll never forget that classy and simple kindness. Coupled with the performance Mr. De Niro gave -- the raw emotion and deep understanding he imbued his character with, and the pure love he gave to Pat, a troubled son -- well, let's just say I'll be pondering that nod for the rest of my life. And I am very grateful.I admit I was surprised when David cast Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, a character who has a deep sense of loss and regret, but a laser-beam direct way of living life. Could an actor so young have enough life experience and confidence to convey the broken intensity of such a character as Tiffany? In that screening room in Tribeca, I was loving the film from the opening shot -- but when Jennifer Lawrence first appears on screen, I found myself gripping the armrests. She is an absolute force. The added bonus for me is that Jennifer plays Tiffany almost exactly how I envisioned her while writing the book. How did Jennifer Lawrence do this at such a young age? What will she do next? How did she hold her own with De Niro and make it look effortless? Are we watching one of the greatest actresses of our time come of age?Bradley Cooper is a Philly guy and was one of the first people to extend a hand in greeting when I visited the movie set. He understands Philly, and Eagles fandom. He runs as deep in person as he does on screen and made this writer feel comfortable during his first day on set, even suggesting I step ahead of him in the food line. That humanity comes through powerfully in his interpretation of Pat -- a man who is trying his damnedest to believe in silver linings and be the best person he is capable of being.Jacki Weaver's nervous concern for all of the characters on the screen rings true, and not just in the context of being Pat's mom. I saw that same hesitant worried look on the faces of many mothers in the suburban Philly neighborhood in which I grew up. From the joy of making 'homemades' and 'crabby snacks' to the horror of watching your son and husband fistfight, Jacki Weaver subtly conveys the complexity of an unsung suburban matriarch who puts the needs of her loved ones before her own.I'll be rooting for all of these people come Oscar night. I'll also be rooting for John Ortiz, who stole many scenes in my humble opinion; Anupam Kher, who has thanked me for writing a non-stereotypical Indian character that afforded him the ability to fulfill his life-long dream of working with Robert De Niro; Julia Stiles, who was lovely when we did a Q&A together in NYC; and the rest of the extremely talented cast and crew.I'll be rooting for Harvey Weinstein too, who took a chance on a young writer's first book. Over a delicious turkey-club sandwich named after Harvey (seriously) just a few weeks ago, we talked about the mental health discussion people are now having across the nation and around the world. Harvey is happy to be a part of that, and so am I.Fans of The Silver Linings Playbook often tell me that Pat's journey makes them feel less alone and gives them hope.That's a beautiful good thing, for which I am very grateful.I'm also grateful for the ways the book and film have furthered the mental health conversation. All the real-life Pats and Tiffanys out there -- and their friends and families -- need to know that no one has to be alone in life and silver linings do exist.Sometimes when you attempt to put your best self into the world, the right people show up.It's true.Matthew Quick, New York Times bestselling author of The Silver Linings Playbook."

The agency's analysis is thorough and compelling in its description of the certain devastation that large-scale mining would bring to this extraordinary region, with inevitable contamination of the ecosystem and the incomparable wild salmon fishery for which it is world-renowned. Each year, this fishery produces between 25 and 50 million wild salmon, generating almost half a billion dollars in revenue for the region and thousands of permanent and temporary jobs.But analysis is not enough.The petitioning Alaska Tribes have requested regulatory action to prevent certain harm - and they deserve to get that action. There has never been a case where EPA intervention under section 404(c) is so clearly warranted, and President Obama - through the EPA - must ensure that it happens. That is the message we delivered repeatedly this week in our nation's capital.NRDC and its 1.4 million members and activists are committed to doing everything we can to help the President and EPA do what must be done in the coming year.

But it does have underwear in it. A few weeks ago, my daughter, Elizabeth, and I went over to the Highline Ballroom, in deepest Chelsea, to see and listen to Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the South African a-capella singing ensemble. They rose to fame on the occasion of Paul Simon's visit to South Africa in 1985 and their collaboration with him then. They have since become a global cultural institution, bringing the rich major-chord choral pleasures of isicathimiya and mbube -- the folk music of the Zulu tribe -- to the whole wide world. We had a comp +1 for the performance, which means that since you're going to write something about the event, you +1 get in free. I had a +1 -- my daughter, 26, a social worker. But wait! My name wasn't on the comp list. How could that be? I had been so careful, I thought -- so eager. So eager to see the performance and talk to Joseph Shabalala -- Dr. Joseph Shabalala, founder and leader of the group, recipient of honorary degrees from the Rhodes University and the University of KwaZulu-Natal. I wanted to know how he and his group felt about their appearance in Mr. Simon's 2012 Emmy-winning documentary ""Under African Skies,"" about the singer-songwriter's controversial visit . (It went against the United Nations' cultural boycott of that nation on account of its continuing enforcement of Apartheid.) And if he had ever met Rodriguez, the American singer, famous in South Africa but for decades obscure here, who is the subject of this year's Oscar-nominated (and I-think-sure-to-win) Best Documentary ""Searching for Sugarman."" Suddenly, South African music was everywhere, including here and now, at the Highline. But no listing of the comp to say nothing of +1. The manager kindly sat us down in the high-ceilinged, softly lit room anyway. He went away to find out what had happened. After a few minutes, he returned and said, ""Are you here to see the Skivvies?"" ""What?"" ""The Skivvies -- they're performing tonight."" ""They're opening for Ladysmith Black Mambazo?"" ""No -- LBM is tomorrow night. Uh, you didn't mention the performers when you walked in. You're on the comp list for tomorrow night. So, um, do you want to stay?"" ""Well, we're here. If we do stay, we should pay, right? Who are the Skivvies?"" ""Well, they're, ah, interesting. A different kind of act. They cover rap songs, pop hits, show tunes, and they do original stuff. It's up to you about paying, You made an honest mistake."" We paid, ordered drinks.  The Skivvies appeared. (Laura Molina and Nick Cearley, we found out later.) They took off all their clothes, except their underwear, which was not minimalistic but pretty revealing. There was a drummer who also took off his clothes. All three were ... well-made. Mr. Cearley played the ukulele, and along with Ms. Molina duetted a rap-song cover with speed and knowing insouciance. They are in their underwear!, I kept thinking. The Skivvies in the flesh! We stayed for a while.  The Skivvies were funny, a little frantic, and ... unignorable. But not in the least South African. So I went back the next night, to see Ladysmith Black Mambazo. I was a comp -1, because my daughter couldn't make it. But I screwed up again, having failed to adequately arrange a conversation with the group. The kind manager handed us a note just before the performance started. It said, ""We apologize but we cannot be available for an interview tonight. Thank you. Ladysmith Black Mambazo."""

He was to basketball as Ali was to boxing: perfection.After all, weâ€™re talking about a guy who averaged 37 points a game during one season, the same guy who shot 50 percent or better five years in a row, and yeah, the same guy who once recorded ten triple-doubles â€¦ in eleven games.

Syndicated travel writer and founder, Airfarewatchdog.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ask-airfarewatchdog-connecting-flights_us_5b9cd064e4b03a1dcc8212ec,You missed your connection -- but why was your return flight cancelled?,2013-02-16,"Travelers pass through a corridor at Philadelphia International Airport, Thursday, Feb. 14, 2013, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd0642000002d00fdb9ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You missed your connection -- but why was your return flight cancelled?Q: I booked a flight on Emirates Airlines from Buffalo to Manila, with connections at New York JFK and Dubai. The flight from Buffalo to New York JFK was on JetBlue, but I bought the entire trip through Emirates on one ticket and with one reservation number. I had 2.5 hours to make the connection at JFK on the outbound flight, but the JetBlue flight was delayed and I missed my onward connection.Emirates was very helpful in getting me to Manila on other airlines with minimal inconvenience. However, when I showed up for my return flight from Manila back to Buffalo I was informed that my entire return itinerary had been canceled because I was deemed a ""no show"" on my New York to Manila flight. Emirates got me to Dubai, but I ended up stranded in Dubai for 22 hours, eventually getting on a flight from Dubai to Dallas, then Dallas to Pittsburgh (which I paid for myself) and then had a friend pick me up for the drive back to Buffalo. All in all, it took me 65 hours to get home. By the way, Emirates refused to provide meals or a hotel while I waited for nearly a full day in Dubai. My question: why was my return flight canceled even though Emirates was aware of the ""misconnect"" at JFK on my outward journey and what, if anything, can I do about this? Am I entitled to denied boarding compensation per U.S. law?A: Oddly, yours was not the first story like this in my inbox this week. There was also the woman flying on Air Canada connecting in Toronto to a British Airways flight. Both of you ended up missing your outbound connection and being labeled as ""no shows"" on the return.First, let me say this. Neither of you had enough time to comfortably connect. Two-and-a-half hours is not enough time to make a domestic-to-international connection at New York's JFK (or Toronto Pearson), especially in winter over the busy holiday travel period. You should never accept such a tight connection. Next time, insist on the maximum layover you can get (four hours sounds about right).If your first flight is on time, great. Enjoy the airport. Read a book. Get a day pass to the lounge. It's worth it. Second, if you do miss your connection, do not get on the rebooked connecting flight without a printout of your complete new itinerary in hand, showing a confirmation of your return segments. Assume that the airline will cancel all of your return flights (even though they're not supposed to do that). Don't wait until you show up for the return to discover you're stranded.Now to your specific situation. No, U.S. denied boarding compensation does not apply in Dubai. Why was your return flight canceled? I contacted both Emirates and JetBlue, and although both are now offering some sort of compensation, I have to say I'm not satisfied and neither should you be. (Emirates is offering to pay for your out-of-pocket expenses, which is great, except it doesn't compensate you for the agony of a 65-hour ordeal getting home; JetBlue is offering a $100 credit, to which I say, big deal).Each airline, in the most politely possible terms, is blaming the other for not ""protecting"" your return flights. Emirates' customer service claims that, ""It is the responsibility of the inbound carrier (in this case JetBlue) to protect a passenger's booking when they become aware of a delay which could result in a missed connection."" Emirates further claims that their representative who booked you on alternate flights (on Delta and Gulf Air via London and Bahrain) did attempt to reinstate your return booking, but your seat was snapped up by another traveler ""due to the busy holiday season."" JetBlue is saying that they, too, attempted ""to find passage on any one of our 20 partners"" but were unable to do so, at which point ""Emirates stepped in to assist by confirming your travel on another carrier. ... Emirates indicates that a communication issue failed to recognize your outbound flight as flown."" I think the key words here are ""failed"" and ""communication."" As soon as your inbound JetBlue flight was recognized as being late (perhaps even before you left the ground in Buffalo) both airlines should have realized that you would miss your Emirates connection from JFK, and both should have immediately worked to protect your return flights. Whether because of human error or poorly coordinated computer systems, this was not done. I think you're entitled to a refund of the return portion of your flight homeward. And I'm shocked that Emirates refused you hotel and meals in Dubai, and made you pay your fare from Dallas to Buffalo. I thought they were better than that."

So, if the only grit you have in your life is in the grout between the tub tiles, then it's time to take on some grit-building behaviors.",2013-02-16,Hiking Boots/Hiking Boots and Legs of a Woman on the Mountain Path,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ccbbc2100005100c54471.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I remember more about the professor's fish necktie than I do the principles that I studied in that Intro to Economics class my junior year in college.But, to this day, more than 20 years later (whoa, did I just say that?) I feel my heart beat fast, and pressure at the base of my throat like a swallowed a bubble whenever I think of Economics 201.Economics hasn't been the only obstacle in my career path. Not even close to the biggest. But, it was a clear one. I had to pass the class to graduate from journalism school, and despite otherwise good transcripts, I was struggling to make the grade.I got a tutor, studied hard, showed up at the professor's office hours (who does that?) participated in a study group, did the assignments. I even read the book -- seriously, I did. Of course, I also worried and fretted and whined. Then, I got a ""No Pass."" So, I did it all again. And again, until I got through it. Grades aren't a big deal when compared to the heavy challenges in life that come later, but it was a toughie at the time and remembering how I prevailed helps me even now to keep going when other obstacles show up. And plenty do. Of course they do. But, now I know I have the grit to see them through. How about you? Do you have grit?True Grit Allows You to Keep GoingGrit, say psychologists, is the quality that makes us willing to commit to the long-term goals and see them through despite adversity. It's a stick-to-it-ness. It is tenacity and a meld of other qualities like optimism, discipline and self-motivation.Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania who have extensively studied resilience and grit say that grit is even more important than intelligence or talent when it comes to succeeding in school, work, and at other tasks. Grit is even the quality, according to research, that helps cadets survive at West Point and kids win spelling bees.But, it isn't some magical quality. We can all get grit. So, if the only grit you have in your life is in the grout between the tub tiles, then it's time to take on some grit-building behaviors.How to Get GritPursue your passion. The things we are passionate about also involve challenge and adversity. Our passions are generally things we have not yet mastered, but things that inspire us and drive us to improve. The process, therefore, becomes rewarding in its own right. If you are pursuing an end-point, say a million bucks, or 50-pound weight loss, make sure you are picking activities and experiences en route to that goal that excite you. Passion will help you persevere -- which is gritty behavior.But, there are bound to be aspects of any goal that you don't find all that interesting. As a writer, there are plenty of parts of the job that I don't like. That's when I challenge myself to find the interesting within the mundane.For example, as a young reporters, I didn't get all that excited about attending city council meetings, but I did enjoy discovering the buried story, the one unique and quirky idea that would often surface in those forums that I could get amped up about. So, while I covered the meeting, I focused on finding that single, unexpected thing. It kept me engaged. It kept me moving toward my other writing goals because it honed my observation skills and creativity. Find your thing, the piece that helps you keep developing your passions even when the task ahead threatens to derail you.Build in practice time. Let's get real -- if you are going to accomplish anything, you're going to have to practice. Get better. Refine, revise all along the way. The people who have the grit needed to succeed, also know it takes hard work. These grit mongers are not turned off by that, instead they continue to learn and train and practice. I set the goal to write a book when I was in the second grade. My first one came out in November. I spent all these years in between practicing and learning and studying the craft of writing until I was ready. Sometimes the practice was enjoyable. Sometimes it was a total drag. But, it was always worthwhile. Push on. Now, keep going. Right? In order to make anything happen you've got to keep at it. Persist. Persevere. Stick to it. There will be days, months even, that you don't want to. There will be setbacks that make you want to quit-- guaranteed. But, by acting gritty, by pushing on even when you feel like throwing in the towel, you'll actually get stronger.So, on the days when you feel like giving up do this: Reevaluate your goal. If you believe it's still important then recommit and take one inspired action in that moment to keep you moving toward it.Find support too. I have a friend who always gives me a little pep talk when I'm too burnt out to do it for myself. Read something inspiring or take on a five-minute practice to remind yourself that you can prevail. That you must because it matters.When people ask how I became a published author I often tell them this: I work hard. I am not the most talented writer out there, but I will not quit. And that dogged determination has contributed to my success. You've got that in you too. Of course you do. And, by practicing these grit-building behaviors you will not only get after your goals, but you will begin to create the life of your dreams.For more by Polly Campbell, click here.

But in these fast-paced, high-tech, self-promotional times, there are whole new tactics for acing life.""Women these days often juggle a lot of success goals, but research is showing that we can achieve the ones most important to us by making key changes in the way we think and act,"" says Carol Dweck, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Stanford University and author of Mindset: The New Psychology of Success.More from Health.com: Stress Relief Tips From Around the World I Did It! Weight-Loss Success Stories Your Secret To Happiness At Every AgeWe spoke with top experts and pros who help people thrive in a variety of fields to gather the most simple yet effective ways to get exactly what you want.Think Big And Small  Success is almost always the culmination of a series of mini successes -- something that's easy to forget when you read about over-overachievers (we're talking about you, Marissa Mayer). ""At work, women often measure themselves by the endpoint, rather than progress made,"" Dweck notes. Yet advancing yourself, whether in your career or level of fitness, is all about nailing small goals. A comprehensive California State University review of research on dietary and physical activity goals found that people were more likely to achieve specific ones -- such as ""walk one mile at lunch three times this week"" -- than grand, vague kinds like ""exercise more often.""What You Can Do: ""Create a spreadsheet of goals, note the tactics and resources that will help, and schedule check-ins with yourself,"" says New York City career coach Roy Cohen, who's worked with thousands of Fortune 500 execs. By all means, share your aspirations and your progress; one study found that people who did weekly email updates with friends were 33 percent more likely to score success than those who just created goals.Put In The Time Seemingly perfect Gwyneth Paltrow reportedly had one thing to say to haters: ""Everything in my life that's good is because I worked my ass off to get it and to maintain it."" She's right, of course; connections and luck only get you so far. Hard work's a longtime tenet of success, though our culture doesn't always prove it. ""We see the Snooki types achieve fame and fortune for doing what seems to be nothing and think, 'Why isn't someone rewarding me?'"" says Scott Love, a legal search consultant who trains recruiters worldwide. While celebrities' day jobs may seem nothing like ours (nothing!), there's almost always work involved in mega-success, he continues: ""Spending real time and effort makes the difference between wishing you had something and actually getting it.""What You Can Do: In the best seller Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell talks about the ""10,000-hour rule"" -- the amount of practice required to ace a skill. But work won't feel like a four-letter word if you're passionate about what you're doing. As for the inevitable tasks you dread, they'll be more palatable if you focus on what you'll get out of them, notes Elizabeth Lombardo, Ph.D., author of Your Ultimate Prescription for Happiness: ""Instead of thinking, 'I have to do this because my boss told me to!' think 'If I do it, I'll look even better to my boss.'""Build Up Grit J.K. Rowling's got legendary amounts of it; she wrote her first Harry Potter manuscript while on welfare and sent it to some 12 publishers before finding a taker. ""Grit can be as essential to success as talent or intelligence,"" says Angela Duckworth, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania who's researched the trait. You don't have to be born with it, adds sports psychologist JoAnn Dahlkoetter, Ph.D., who's worked with athletes at the last five Olympics: ""Anyone can have incredible determination -- and achieve great things -- if they set their mind to it.""What You Can Do: Motivational psychologists often recommend daily visualization. The more detailed you can be (you're wearing a blue shirt as you fly past the finish line, friends are cheering), the more motivating it is. DIY pep talks also help. ""Elite athletes push past pain and fatigue with power words,"" says Dahlkoetter, author of Your Performing Edge. ""One athlete came up with 'Keep going, energy flowing.' Saying it engages other senses, which makes it more potent.""Make Failure Work For You Successful types view setbacks as learning opportunities -- not irreversible disasters. ""Think of a scientist who puts two chemicals together and doesn't get the desired outcome,"" Lombardo says. ""Does he beat himself up? Nope. He thinks, what do I need to add or do differently next time?"" In fact, research published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows that people with a history of some setbacks are likely to have more satisfying lives.What You Can Do: Take time to dissect failures. ""If you're trying to lose 10 pounds and you eat a fattening dinner out, really think about what happened -- say, you were tired -- and use that data to score success next time,"" Lombardo says. Then move on. Take a tip from baseball coaches, who tout a ""closer's mentality"": Forget yesterday's performance and focus on the now.Keep Emotions In Check  President Obama and the head of your school board have one thing in common: They think twice before they speak. ""Managing your emotions so they work for you, not against you, is a common behavior of people with successful careers and relationships,"" says David R. Caruso, Ph.D., one of the leading experts on emotional intelligence. Social media and email can instantly erase trust and respect, he cautions: ""How many people hastily write an email in anger, only to regret it later?""What You Can Do: ""If you're upset, pause and ask yourself why,"" Caruso says. ""See if you're overreacting or [if you] misperceived something, or if some other issue is adding to your anger."" You'll have a more measured response -- a winning tactic in life.Supercharm 'Em  People are getting ruder, say 76% of Americans in a Rasmussen Reports poll -- one reason someone with finesse stands out, experts agree. And it can pay off: A University of California at Berkeley study found that ""feminine charm"" (being warm, friendly, and even a little flirty) produces good results for women in salary negotiations and more.What You Can Do: Researchers have pinpointed specific behaviors of world-class charmers: They smile and are animated when they talk, they make eye contact, they use people's names, and they listen.

In March, the search for Benedict's replacement will begin with a process called the Papal Conclave.
