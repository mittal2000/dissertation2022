The area with the most miserable residents is Huntington, West Virginia.To determine the well-being of Americans, Gallup-Healthways surveyed hundreds of thousands of Americans in 189 metropolitan areas in the U.S. in 2012 and 2013. The survey recorded the physical and emotional health of the residents, as well as financial, employment, and social indicators, among others. The resulting Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index allows for comparisons between places and over time.Click here to see America’s most content cities One of the six categories that comprised the index was physical health. The category included different health measures, such as the prevalence of certain diseases and conditions. Physical health was a meaningful predictor of how content — or miserable — residents were. The higher a metro area’s score in the Well-Being Index, the more likely its residents were to report good physical health.For instance, residents of the cities with the highest overall well-being were less likely than most Americans to report being obese. Residents in Boulder and Fort Collins, Colorado, which were among the nation’s most content cities, reported the nation’s lowest and third-lowest obesity rates, respectively. Similarly, residents of most of the content cities were less likely to report that they had diabetes or that they had previously suffered a heart attack.Click here to see America’s most miserable citiesIn America’s most miserable cities, residents were less likely to be in good physical health and far more likely to report unhealthy behaviors. Residents in all of the nation’s 10 most miserable areas were more likely to smoke than the average American. In one of these cities, Charleston, West Virginia, slightly over 35% of people said they smoked — the worst rate in the nation. Respondents in all of America’s most content cities, on the other hand, were less likely to smoke. Six of the most content cities had among the 10 lowest smoking rates.While income wasn’t a direct measure in the index, differences in incomes were quite prominent between America’s most content and miserable areas. In all but one of the 10 areas with the highest Well-Being Index scores, the median household income was well in excess of the national median of $51,371 in 2012. In San Jose the median household income was more than $90,000 that year, the highest in the country. In two other cities, Honolulu and San Francisco, it was more than $70,000.Conversely, in each of the 10 cities with the lowest well-being scores, incomes were lower than the typical American household. In three of these metro areas, median household income was less than $40,000 in 2012.According to Patrick Bogart, director at Gallup, the effects income has on well-being are manifested in different ways. “You have better emotional health, [because] you worry less about money for example,” Bogart said. Higher income can also improve health because it allows access to better food, health care services and medicines.Educational attainment, too, wasn’t a direct factor in the index but had a strong relationship to peoples’ well-being. Bogart told 24/7 Wall St. that a good education generates opportunities for Americans. “It opens up opportunities to learn or do something interesting; it opens up job or income opportunities that don’t exist [without a higher education],” Bogart said.In fact, all of the areas with the highest Well-Being Index scores had large populations of college graduates. In Boulder, Colorado, nearly 58% of residents aged 25 and up had at least a bachelor’s degree, the highest rate in the country. In the nation’s most miserable cities, the percentage of adults with a degree was universally lower than the national rate of 29.1%, and in four instances, it was below 20%.In many cases, content cities often featured major research universities. Provo, Boulder, Fort Collins, and Ann Arbor are all well known for their large academic institutions. And, according to Gallup’s Bogart, “Folks in these college towns have opportunities to learn, to grow, [and] to experience new and interesting things.” Having interesting experiences daily, Bogart added, is critical to overall well-being. “It’s one thing to be physically healthy,” he said. “But to be experiencing something new, to be [frequently] learning something new, really provides a person their identity.”24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 189 metropolitan areas assessed by the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. This index calculates well-being for the U.S., as well as for states, metropolitan areas and occupations. Scores range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing ideal well-being. The index is composed of six sub-indices that measure access to basic needs, healthy behaviors, work environment, physical health, life evaluation and emotional health. 24/7 Wall St. also considered income, poverty and educational attainment figures from the U.S. Census Bureau, all from 2012. We reviewed local, seasonally adjusted unemployment rates, current as of December 2013, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We also considered violent crime rates for 2012 by metropolitan statistical area from the FBI Uniform Crime Report Program.These are America’s most content and miserable cities."
1,ENTERTAINMENT,'Noah' Review: 8 Observations About Darren Aronofsky's Captivating But Flawed Epic,"Matthew Jacobs, Contributor

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures, Niko Tavernise)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb453d6260000cf00825314.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Noah"" floods theaters this weekend with perhaps as much controversy as it will cash flow. Darren Aronofsky's religious epic cost at least $125 million to make, and now it opens with close eyes on how faith-driven moviegoers respond to the loose biblical interpretation of Genesis' great-flood parable. After seeing the film, it's clear that ""Noah"" is not the next ""Passion of the Christ."" It's weird (but not weird enough), shrouded in fantasy (yet nowhere near as blasphemous as certain Christian bloggers like to espouse) and plastered with just as many Aronofsky-esque qualities as the ""Black Swan"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" auteur could shove into the 138-minute drama (not enough). Here are some observations about the film.1. Everything you've read in the Bible is there. It just fills in the holes with fantasy. So calm down.  The story of Noah spans four chapters of Genesis, a decent length for a biblical parable. Still, if our ark-building hero is going to appear on the big screen, it's necessary that Aronofsky -- who wrote the screenplay alongside frequent collaborator Ari Handel -- make specific deductions about what happened in between God's apocalyptic request and Noah's fulfillment of his promise. That's not distorting fundamentalism; it's a director retaining his right to shape a classic story in the manner he sees fit. If moviegoers approach ""Noah"" as the ""fantasy epic"" Aronofsky billed it to be, they'll understand that aspects like the Watchers -- fallen angels that look like a hybrid between Transformers and Rockbiter from ""The NeverEnding Story"" -- are not meant to scorn the religious narrative.2. Speaking of the Watchers, they're pretty ridiculous, but somehow they work. ""This is still a Darren Aronofsky movie, right?"" I asked myself when the Watchers made their first appearance. They're towering creatures made of boulders and clearly intended as a crowd-pleaser amid the darkness that envelops the movie. I'd liken them to a displaced ""Lord of the Rings"" outtake. But these primeval brutes are equal parts goofy and fascinating, just as the Ents were in ""The Two Towers."" To give the fallen angels wings and frocks would have seemed a pointed effort to thrust the non-biblical approach in our faces, as if Aronofsky wants it known that he can distort religious motifs. Instead, it's overwrought to get lost in the assumption that no such created walked God's early earth, and so we settle back and allow these absurd additions to prance around with their gravelly voices (Nick Nolte, Frank Langella and ""Breaking Bad"" actor Mark Margolis among them) and unruly demeanor. By the time they're aiding Noah in seeing the ark to completion, I was enamored with their presence.3. Noah may be heroic, but he's still human. The Old Testament is nothing short of haunting. It's brimming with destruction, desolation and impressions of a wrathful God. Noah is presented, appropriately, as a lasting bastion of righteousness. Yet why should he be exalted for his heroism in a way that in turn dehumanizes him? Russell Crowe plays Noah as a brooding man, one who's filled with both bitterness and an infinite capacity to adhere to his Creator's commands. In depicting Noah's drunken stupor and avoiding a portrait of obsequious peacekeeper, Aronofsky skips the whitewashed Noah that a more traditional (and less affecting) approach would have employed.4. And Russell Crowe is pretty good in the role. Crowe gets into Noah's skin while avoiding a repeat of the repugnant scowl that stank up ""Les Misérables"" and ""Robin Hood."" Where you expect a stentorian delivery, Crowe is thoughtful. This Noah is tormented, and -- particularly in the movie's third act, when his devoutness is tested -- he wrestles with some of the same demons that any discerning man or woman of faith should. Crowe is just sensitive enough to make Noah a real person but just domineering enough to shepherd the story's morality.5. But this is Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly's show. (Too bad all the other characters are so underdeveloped.)  Watson plays Ila, whom Noah and his three sons and wife adopt as an orphaned child. Ila isn't part of Noah's bloodline, yet she's more essential to the story than any of Noah's offspring, including the one she's in love with (Shem, played by a nondescript Douglas Booth). The movie attempts to make the middle son, Ham (Logan Lerman), the token black sheep of the family, but it's a trite way to enact conflict, and his ultimate fate -- no spoilers -- is inexplicable. So that leaves Watson ample room to shine, and she does, in her best post-Hogwarts performance to date. Ila is barren, but with the divine help of Noah's grandfather Methuselah (a playful Anthony Hopkins), she and Shem are able to conceive and thereby help to repopulate the world. The turmoil Watson carries through the performance results, in the third act, in an arc so electrifying that even Dumbledore would gawk at the magic she emits. Similarly, Connelly, playing Noah's wife, gets her crowning moment, in which she confronts her husband after he's informed them God has demanded he kill himself and his family as well, including Ila's new baby. These tear-stricken moments give Watson and Connelly a bravado that the movie's male actors don't achieve. 6. The visuals are stunning, but the movie could be weirder. Aronofsky's indie sensibilities are intact, but sometimes you have to squint to find them. Otherwise, you might mistake ""Noah"" for apocalypse porn. They're most present via evolution sequences: interludes in which the earth forms and expands before our eyes in a mystical swirl of birth. Like Terrence Malick's ""Tree of Life,"" ""Noah"" depicts the creation story -- biblical and otherwise -- through the backdrop of nascent landscapes and unripe humanity. But that's about as Aronofskian as the movie gets, since the Watchers feel like they could just as easily hail from a Peter Jackson or -- and I swear I don't mean this as invective -- a Michael Bay effort. The distinctive touches Aronofsky is known for imbuing (the canted camera angles of ""Requiem,"" the unfiltered feel of ""The Wrestler,"" the psychological twilight of ""Black Swan"") are missing. It's a semi-squandered opportunity for the director to bring his eclecticism to the masses. 7. The third act's tension punches us in the stomach and then hits us over the head with its moral. Without spoiling what happens with Noah's determination to sacrifice his family so the world can belong to the animals' Eden-like purity, the movie's crescendo is wrenching. It's as much of a CGI-laden spectacle as imaginable, and it works as both a narrative climax and multiplex-friendly grandiosity. The stakes! The drama! It all barrels to a gasp-worthy conclusion, and then, after the action comes to a halt, we're pounded with a conversation designed to exact the moral proclamation we'd already surmised. A ravishing finale is reduced to schmaltz, like the indie-happy Aronofsky expected his biggest-budgeted movie to be too sophisticated for us to gather our own assessments about the denouement's principles. It's patronizing.8. But, overall, the movie is a success.  Not without its flaws, ""Noah"" is a valiant effort. It's creative and engrossing, and Aronofsky succeeds in bookending his flat notes with chords of movie magic. There's a sprinkling of a muddy environmentalist message, but it's easy to ignore it if you so choose. The animals are an afterthought in this ark's equation, but the deluge's CGI is cranked up to just the right octave. It's cartoonish enough to remain fantasy but breathtaking enough to be shrouded in terrifying reality. With committed performances and no holier-than-thou overtones, ""Noah"" is a dreamboat for all sorts of moviegoers -- just as long as you can dismiss some of the murkier storms that precede the rainbow."

Each time he has visited, he's found new reasons to return. Here are 10 reasons why Mexico is the place to be, in Joe's words.1. People: The level of friendliness of the Mexican people is among the highest in the world. Everywhere you go someone will be willing to lend a helping hand. Here is one of my favorite highlights, which captures the friendly spirit of the Mexican people.2. Value: Your dollar can go a long way in Mexico and the price-to-value ratio is high. (Remember what Warren Buffett says, ""Price is what you pay, value is what you get."") As you travel into the interior of Mexico and away from major beach destinations, you'll notice the difference in prices. Two of my favorite areas are San Miguel de Allende and Guanajuato.3. Food: I can't say enough about the freshness, flavors, diversity, and quality of Mexican food. Every region brings its own distinct traditions. From roadside stands to Michelin-starred restaurants, Mexico is home to some great eats. Sayulita is my recommendation for the world's best shrimp burrito. And when in Mexico City you need to eat at Dulce Patria and Anatol.4. The Pacific Coast: I love Mexico's Pacific Coast. There is so much coastline to explore. One of my favorite spots is the area around Puerto Vallarta. The small villages north and south of the city bring you back to a calm and tranquil state of mind. One of my top beach towns is Sayulita, which is about 45 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta.5. Escape from it all: Mexico has always had a reputation as one of the world's best hideouts. From the beaches of Tulum and Oaxaca to the haciendas in the Yucatan, you won't have to search long and hard to find your perfect escape. La Casa Que Canta was one of my hideaways this year. And for our Editor in Chief, Julia Cosgrove, her ""go to"" is Amansala in Tulum.6. Indigenous culture: Spending time in Chiapas, I developed a love for, and a fascination with, Mexico's indigenous culture. The textiles are beautifully hand-woven and the people here use clothes and patterns as a form of communication. Chiapas isn't one of Mexico's most traveled areas, and there's plenty of opportunity to explore beneath the surface.7. An easy long weekend: Mexico is not far away, regardless of where you live in the United States. From the West Coast, Baja is only a couple of hours away. And from the East Coast you have the Yucatan. For your next long weekend, consider spending it in Mexico.8. The music: From mariachi to modern rock, Mexico pulses with infectious tunes. Head to Guadalajara to spend time in the place that calls mariachi home. Or when you're in Mexico City, take a trip to Plaza Garibaldi. If modern is more your style, download some of Mana's best tracks.9. Tequila and mezcal: I'm a huge fan of these truly Mexican spirits. And it takes a trip to Jalisco and Oaxaca to begin to understand the depth and variety of flavor that tequila and mezcal afford. Shake off your awful memories of getting drunk on Cuervo as a teenager and begin to explore the quality of real 100% agave-made tequila. You'll leave the hangover at home.10. Architectural ruins: Mexico is home to some of the richest archaeological sites in the world. Thousands of pyramids dot its landscape, with the most famous near Tulum and Mexico City. This year I visited the pyramids of Teotihuacan and Guachimontones. To begin to comprehend the knowledge and vision it took to construct these will take your breath away.Photo courtesy of Verana."

Questions that stir up emotion and make you wonder if they're mature enough to hear the answer.This happened to Carter Gaddis and me the other night and we began talking about what we would or should say when put in this position. It went a little something like this...--Adrian KulpCarter: So, we're tossing this purple rubber ball back and forth in the family room and my oldest son keeps telling me to make it tougher to catch. Add spin. Make it bounce short. Throw it hard. Harder!Then, as only an 8-year-old kid can do a minute before bedtime, he hits me with the question:""Dad, what's the hardest thing you've ever done?""I pause mid-toss. How do you even answer a question like that? It had the ring of something beyond the usual pre-bedtime stalling tactic. It deserved some actual thought.""Good question, bud,"" I say. ""Let me think about it.""I'm still thinking.Adrian: Jeez, man. My kids are only 4½, 2½ and 8 weeks old. The toughest question I've had so far is, ""Why don't you poop through your penis?"" I don't know what I'd do if I were in your position, but I guess it's not too early to start thinking about it.The hardest thing you've ever done? And your boy is 8 years old? What am I going to tell my 8-year-old when it comes time? I don't know if they're ready for it.I'd like to just tell them that I've fallen off my bike a few times and gotten back up -- a vanilla metaphor for growing up -- but that wouldn't be the truth.Things in life are hard in different ways. They can be physical, mental or the worst of them all, emotional.I guess I could tell them about how I worked my ass off on a farm in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, in 1988 -- my first job, when I was 12 years old. We used to clean out the cow stalls in the dead of winter, in negative-degree temperatures.It was me, my best friend Dave and his older brother, Brian. There were a dozen pens and after ten hours with a half-hour sandwich break inside the farmhouse, the monotony wore on us. We got bored and were looking to break loose.Not only did we lift up the matted-down cow dung with a pitchfork and toss it outside onto the wagon -- we took aim at each other, using our core strength to pitch and whip fifty pounds of steaming shit onto one another.Shit fights.That's hard. It's hard on the body and hard on the soul. Plus you had feces in your hair while riding your bike home at dusk. But it's probably not the hardest thing I've had to do.Carter: Cow turd? That all you got? Dude. I used to live on a farm. We used cow turd for soap.Let me tell you about the spring of 1985. I had just turned 16. It was my first day working at Wendy's in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. I showed up early and the manager took me outside, where it was 95 degrees with 1,000 percent humidity.He led me to an open-air enclosure, four brick walls eight feet high, accessible only through a small metal door: the grease pit. Leaning against the nearest wall were four new push brooms. Next to them were 10 unopened bottles of bleach.""Clean this out and come find me inside,"" he said, and left me there, holding a broom.It took all my strength to push open the door. It took more strength than I knew I had to keep from hurling all over my new Wendy's uniform when I saw the first dead bird half-buried in the six-inch-thick layer of congealed grease that covered the floor. There were other things in there, too. Bad things. But I grabbed my broom, dumped a full bottle of bleach onto the slop and started to scrub.Five hours later, covered from head to toe in grease and... other stuff, the back of my neck sunburned bright red, I found the manager looking over the ledger in his office. He looked stunned to see me still there, then wrinkled his nose at the smell of me.He admitted the first three kids he ordered to clean the grease pit had bailed without even opening the door. Then he promoted me to the grill and let me name my raise.Adrian: OK Carter, OK. So we've both had some physical obstacles to overcome and maybe our kids will buy into the whole ""tough jobs build character"" routine, but what happens when they have something that affects them mentally?I really don't want to coddle them, but there will come a time when I'll have to tell them about the time I lost everything.1996. I was a junior in college. I had spent the night up the street at a girlfriend's house when her phone rang around 6 a.m. ""There's smoke and flames, get down here now..."" and then the phone went dead.My roommate had awoken to the living room of our second-story apartment completely engulfed in flames. She had enough time to call the fire department and then me, wake up the neighbors, pick up her cat and get outside with everyone else.I raced up to the scene not more than five minutes later, jumped from the cab of my truck, spoke briefly to my roommate and ran upstairs to unlock the door and enter the apartment. I thought maybe it was just a coffee table fire and I'd be able to put it out.I crawled on my stomach through the kitchen as the smoke began to thicken. I could feel the heat on my face and began to choke, fighting for air. I realized that I was next to an active gas line hooked up to the stove and decided to turn around.As I ran onto Main Street, the windows of our apartment blew out on top of us.Multiple fire departments responded -- it was the biggest fire in Mansfield, Pennsylvania, in over 100 years. It took out almost half of a city block. When all was said and done, I had lost everything. Nine of us were left homeless, several businesses lost.I stood in a phone booth across the street and called my mom, who was working as a nurse in a hospital burn unit. I told the nurse in charge that it was an emergency. At 20 years old, I cried into the receiver with my head pressed against the glass and told my mom that I had lost everything, I was watching everything I owned disintegrate, but I was OK.I would later find the silver lining in this tragedy and realize that people aren't defined by their possessions. Always be yourself and treat others as you would want to be treated. People will love you for it... and that's all you'll ever need.Are my kids ready for that?  Carter: Holy crap, Adrian. That's brutal. I suppose I could counter with the time I got laid off from my newspaper job of 16 years, or something similarly devastating and life-altering. Instead... let me tell you about this thing that happened when I used to write about baseball for a newspaper.Sometimes you don't even know what you're doing is hard until you've done it. Then you look back and you're like, ""What the hell was I thinking?"" That's what happened to me at the 2006 All-Star Game in Pittsburgh.We had one Tampa Bay Devil Rays player in the game, a lefty starter with a big arm named Scott Kazmir. We had to wait and see if Kaz got into the game, then write something about how he did. He did pretty well: a scoreless sixth inning in the American League's 3-2 victory.When it was over, all we needed was a quick quote or two from Kazmir and we could file our stories. Deadline was fast approaching, so the other writer and I sprinted down to the AL clubhouse -- only to find no sign of Kazmir. His locker was empty. I asked a clubhouse attendant if he'd seen Kaz, and he told us the pitcher had bolted after his shower.No way would this stand. Kazmir knew we needed him, but he had forgotten. Understandable, but irritating. With deadline 15 minutes off, I left the clubhouse and turned toward the staging area where the buses waited to carry the players and their family members back to the hotel or to the airport. With the writer from the other newspaper trailing closely behind, I blasted through two security checkpoints like I was somebody (ha!) and found the bus with the sign that said, ""American League.""Ignoring protocol and the sign that read, ""Players and Family Only,"" I stepped onto the bus. A hundred sets of eyes turned toward me. I began to move down the aisle, looking side to side for my player. I passed Vladimir Guerrero, Kenny Rogers, Vernon Wells, none of whom had any idea who I was or why I was there. I ignored the glares and zeroed in on Kazmir, who sat on my left mid-way back, next to his brother. He looked up and jumped a little just as I leaned over and said, ""Kaz, got a minute?""He apologized for forgetting and followed me off the bus. It wasn't easy, but we got our interview.Adrian: Dang, you were determined to follow through on your commitment -- anyone can respect that. So we've both been beat up and had our heads twisted inside and out. But what happens when our kids have an emotional battle to contend with?I'd think about telling them about the time that my best friend, Carmen, died in his sleep at 25 and I gave a eulogy at his funeral in front of his family and our closest friends, but it's not the hardest emotional battle that I've fought.2011. The day after my wife and I drove ourselves and our two kids across the country to Washington D.C. from Los Angeles, to start a new life. We got a call that our 1-year-old niece had been killed. She had been struck by a car.Our family had been twisted up emotionally and we spent the better portion of the next month down south, grieving. This is the night we remembered Olivia in the park where she was killed. We launched balloons into the air for her to see. As Ava and I stood there, she said, ""Daddy, it's Tangled!"" in my ear. I knew what she meant. She was talking about her favorite Disney movie, where the King and Queen, who had their daughter stolen from them, launched lanterns into the night, every year, on the same day... her birthday. They were meant for Rapunzel to see, and in our case, for Liv to see.I told Ava that Olivia was our lost princess. I struggled, knowing that her cousin was gone.This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. To watch my brother-in-law speak in front of the church congregation without skipping a beat, only to nearly collapse into my sister-in-law's arms in the pew ahead of us.I still can't make any sense of this, why someone so young and innocent would be taken from us so early. How do I tell my kids about that? How do I tell my kids what happened to their cousin?THAT might actually be the hardest thing I'll ever have to do.  Carter: Yeah. Man, that's the nightmare. As dads, as parents, the randomness of it all just might be the cruelest part. There really is no way to explain it to a child. Even if it happens to them. Maybe especially if it happens to them.And that makes me think about this: The hardest thing I've done. The thing that nearly wrecked me. The thing my wife and I still have nightmares about, and probably always will.I sat in the front passenger seat of the ambulance with my head in my hands, rocking back and forth, afraid to look back, afraid that if I did, I would see my son die. It happened on a Friday night, the start of what was supposed to be a birthday celebration for my wife at Walt Disney World.Without getting into the details, something completely unexpected happened while we all slept. After a terrifying 10 minutes waiting for the paramedics, my wife and I found ourselves in that ambulance with our suddenly, inexplicably ailing son, then in a hospital emergency room with nurses and physicians and other strangers surrounding a table where the skinny form of our son lay, his eyes glazed, his body inert, IV tubes trailing off the side of the table, machines beeping and blinking and my head in my hands.He's completely healthy now. In fact, he's the one who asked me the question that got this whole thing started, the one I was playing catch with before bedtime the other night. I think I know now what the answer is, but I still don't know how to tell him that the hardest thing I've ever done is to confront the very real possibility that he was going to die right there in front of us, and that there was absolutely nothing I could do to stop it.I hope it's the hardest thing I ever have to do, because I don't know how I'd handle anything tougher than that.____________________________________The reality is that life is full of hard moments. We look into the eyes of our innocent children and don't want to ever see them hurt or suffer, whether it be physically, mentally or emotionally. We want them to lead a perfect Norman Rockwell existence, but that's just not reality.We can't protect them from everything. Thing is, just because they're old enough to ask the question, it doesn't necessarily mean they're ready for the answer. Yet, to keep stories like these a secret from them would be doing them a disservice.It might be that all we can do is to use our best judgment to know when they're ready. And when they are, there might be no better way to teach them about the trials of life than by sharing our own hardships. Not for pity, not to impress. But to serve as guide posts for our children to navigate their own difficult times. To prove that even after all of the hard things, there is more. Then more. And better. Even better.This post originally appeared on Adrian Kulp's blog, ""Dad or Alive,"" and Carter Gaddis's blog, ""Dadscribe."" Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter |   Contact HuffPost Parents"
8,WELLNESS,How Current Arthritis Treatment Fails Patients,"Kevin R Stone, Contributor
Orthopedic Surgeon and Regenerative Medicine Pioneer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/healthy-living-news_us_5b9defcee4b03a1dcc8f18be,"Why is it that are we still in the outdated ""wait, rest, drugs, joint replacement"" era? Here is the shocking data.",2014-03-28,2014-03-20-PatientDoctorshutterstock_164560673.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-03-20-PatientDoctorshutterstock_164560673-thumb.jpg,"You are told you have knee arthritis. The doctor isn't positive why, maybe genetics, maybe that old soccer injury in high school, maybe because a surgeon removed some of the meniscus cartilage. The advice the doctor gives you is to go home, rest your knee, take anti-inflammatory drugs, lose some weight, wait until you are older and then get an artificial knee replacement.This advice is awful. In the 21st century, wouldn't you think the advice could be: Here is how to fix your problem and, by the way, here is how to use the injury as an opportunity to get fitter than you have been in years?Why is it that are we still in the outdated ""wait, rest, drugs, joint replacement"" era? Here is the shocking data.The dramatic increase in knee injuries in athletes of all ages is leading to a rise in the silent killer of active lifestyles: osteoarthritis. An estimated 27 million Americans age 25 and older have osteoarthritis, up from 21 million in 1990. [1]If you injure your knee in high school and either you live with it or the surgeon removes a portion of the articular cartilage, the bearing surface of the joint, or the meniscus cartilage, the fibrous shock absorber, you have a more than 80-percent chance of developing arthritis within 20 years.If you have osteoarthritis and are 20 to 60 years old, the standard of care recommended by the National Arthritis Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the top 10 hospitals in the U.S. includes 20-plus treatment options. These consist of 11 lifestyle changes (lose weight, don't run etc.), eight drug regimens (over the counter, prescription and injections) and three surgeries (debridement, lavage and osteotomy). Once you turn 60, you will be recommended for a knee replacement, the only treatment option to address the underlying cause of the arthritis. The rest of the treatments manage the symptoms, which counterproductively encourage people to resume the activities that further damage the joint.If you get a knee replacement, you've got a 50-percent chance of still having pain afterwards and impact sports are forbidden.Every year, 700 thousand knee arthroscopy procedures, where the meniscus cartilage is partially removed, are performed in Ambulatory Surgical Centers in the U.S. More than 20 million people already have knee osteoarthritis. [2]Yet ways to treat and prevent osteoarthritis are available, just not fully accepted or proven. If your meniscus is torn, it can be repaired or replaced by a donor meniscus replacement. There are several studies documenting that meniscus replacement in the setting of arthritis can improve patients' pain, function and activity levels provided that the cartilage damage is treated as well [3,4,5,6] with new data promising the ability to participate in sports for over 10 years. [7] Despite this, less than 1 percent of torn meniscus cartilages are repaired and only 1,500 meniscus replacements are performed in the U.S. each year. [8]Articular cartilage can be repaired. A two- to 12-year outcome study combining meniscus replacement with the articular cartilage paste grafting technique demonstrated an 80 percent success rate at improving function and diminishing pain in arthritic patients with a survival of the implants estimated at 9.9 years. [9] A 10- to 20-year outcome study is soon to be reported with similar encouraging results. Osteoarthritis can be treated, possibly even prevented, and certainly the injuries to the joint that lead to more severe arthritis can be successfully repaired.So why are so few people treated? Firstly, doctors and insurers demand more of what are called Level 1 studies, which are usually prospective, comparative blind trials where one patient receives the treatment and another receives a placebo. These are extremely difficult to do for patients who have significant knee injuries and are requesting repair, even though the absence of treatment has a certain failure rate.Additionally, these procedures are technically difficult (few surgeons have extensive meniscus replacement experience). Also, cost and lack of reimbursement are the most frequently cited reasons why the initial injury or the arthritis is not repaired. The insurers of today most likely will not be around to foot the bill of the arthritis you get a decade from now. And finally politics. The Arthritis Foundation is a rheumatology entity that focuses on inflammatory arthritis. Very few people with arthritis have inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis. Most people have osteoarthritis or traumatic arthritis. The disproportionate spending on the minority has led to a neglect of the trauma-induced arthritis that most athletes suffer from.Stay tuned. Patients are demanding a better level of arthritis care. And the NFL and other sports entities are starting to pay attention to the long-term effects of injury to the knees, not just the concussions we hear about more often. The silent arthritis is soon to be less quiet.First published in The San Francisco Examiner.References: 1. Lawrence RC, Felson DT, Helmick CG, et al.

(Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df33b2200008300d9d381.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I do not know Gwyneth Paltrow. I've never met her, don't have friends who hang with her, and have no personal insight into what makes her tick. I should treat her with the same indifference I feel for most celebrities, and I would, if only she would stop giving me reasons to dislike her. I've forgiven her for dating my crushes in the '90s, and I've made my peace with the fact that she rocks a pixie cut in a way I never will. I don't entirely loathe goop, because although it is on some level a vapid, irritating ode to inanity, I am easily swayed by good recipes involving kale. And, despite the infamous open letter describing her ""conscious uncoupling"" from her husband (which I have mocked privately, and now, I guess, publicly), I honestly don't take any joy in someone's separation. But her recent comments on what it means to be a working parent have pushed me over the edge. Gwyneth recently gave an interview to E! in which she discussed the challenges she faces as a working mom. I understand that. I have friends who work in television and film and they work long hours and have erratic schedules. Sometimes they don't get to see their kids as much as they'd like. That's not ideal for anyone, so I don't begrudge Gwyneth a bit of whining. It's what she said next that made me think she's either woefully out of touch or just plain callous. Possibly both. After acknowledging that she doesn't have to work every day and limits herself to making one film a year, she then suggests that she has it harder than parents with more regular schedules.I think it's different when you have an office job, because it's routine and, you know, you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening. When you're shooting a movie, they're like, ""We need you to go to Wisconsin for two weeks,"" and then you work 14 hours a day and that part of it is very difficult. I think to have a regular job and be a mom is not as, of course there are challenges, but it's not like being on set.No, it isn't, but probably not in the way Gwyneth thinks. I don't know a single parent who read that interview and thought, ""Wow. I never realized how easy I have it, what with the getting up at 5:30 to get ready for work, making sure the kids are fed and off safely to school, spending a 8-18 hour day at my job, then rushing home to make dinner/put the kids to bed, and doing it all again tomorrow."" Mackenzie Dawson's open letter to Gwyneth in the New York Post probably sums up our universal incredulity best. Read it. You can thank me later. Last year when I wrote ""What Not To Say To A Working Mom,"" it never occurred to me that I should have included special instructions for those highly privileged people with vast wealth and significant flexibility and autonomy over their working lives. I didn't think it was necessary to caution the very fortunate not to compare themselves to parents who may not have those resources. I was wrong. I don't want to reject out of hand whatever parenting challenges Gwyneth may face, because I believe that all parents struggle in one way or another. Whether you are a stay-at-home dad, a breadwinner mom, a dual-earner family or a bajillionaire, every job has downsides, and every opportunity presents obstacles. I'm sure there are times when Gwyneth wonders what it would be like to have a more ""regular"" job. That's fine. I often wonder what it would be like to have several multi-million dollar homes and an Oscar. But complaining about how hard she has it while romanticizing the lives of working parents with more traditional careers means Gwyneth is either remarkably self-absorbed or deliberately obtuse. There's something dismissive and condescending about her comments. Let me be very clear -- and frankly I can't believe I have to say this -- there is nothing ""easy"" about working a 9-5 job and raising a family. If you have the luxury of working only when you want to, if you can travel the world, have a staff, pay for private school, afford health care and ensure that your children want for nothing, please do not wonder aloud if it wouldn't be easier if you had a more ordinary life. Your life is privileged. There are parents, like Katrina Gilbert, for example, whose lives are truly trying. Who work at jobs that barely pay their bills, who struggle to feed their children and who come home exhausted not just during one or two months of the year, but every single day. The rest of us should just count our blessings. Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter |   Contact HuffPost ParentsAlso on HuffPost:"
