0,POLITICS,Clinton 2016 Coverage Is A Wild Ride On The Signal-To-Noise Rollercoaster,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-2016-media-coverage_n_5577900.html,,2014-07-11,"Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gestures during a presentation of her new book at Schiller theatre on July 6, 2014 in Berlin, Germany. Clinton's book entitled 'Hard Choices' is reportedly only selling in small numbers. AFP PHOTO / OLIVER LANG (Photo credit should read OLIVER LANG/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cf73200000f90101d0b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Longtime Eat The Press readers know that our official position on 2016 speculatin' in the year 2014 is that we'd love it if there was far, far less of it. But that doesn't mean we'd like none. As Jonathan Bernstein wrote two days after the last presidential election, the 2016 contest has long been on like Donkey Kong. The only question is, is it going to be covered sensibly or not?There are some examples of sensible coverage. Why, just this week I had the pleasure of reading Patrick Caldwell's story, ""The Huge Campaign Finance Loophole Hillary Clinton Isn't Using -- Yet,"" describing how Clinton might interact with the various super PACs that ally themselves with her presidential ambitions. And I have to say, Caldwell's article serves as a great counterpoint to all the pundits who intone some variation on the ""Hillary won't say it, but of course she's running for president"" theme while smirking down their noses at you. It's as if it says, ""You know what? There actually is a useful and substantive distinction to be made between the things Clinton can do now (publicly coordinate with super PACs whenever she wants) and the things she'll have to do as an official candidate (make sure no evidence of coordination comes to light).""That's the sort of coverage one should likely file under ""useful."" Somewhat controversially, perhaps, I also would include in that category the recent coverage leading from a Washington Free Beacon scoop involving Clinton's time as an attorney, during which she defended an accused child rapist. It's an early indicator of what opposition researchers will try to do to Clinton if she runs: undermine her reputation as a champion of women and girls. (Don't fret, I have no worry that the people flogging this story are going to start championing reforms to a criminal justice system that is stacked against rape survivors. This is modern American politics, where histrionic displays of concern run in inverse proportion to sincerity.)Unfortunately, you can't have a signal-to-noise ratio without the noise. And since Clinton looms the largest over the 2016 landscape right now, coverage of her proto-campaign is full of it: ""Why hasn't Clinton performed this banal task? What is Clinton going to do about this thing about which she can do nothing? When will Clinton wander onto this rug, so that it can be pulled out from under her?"" The debate rages on, because if the raging ever stopped, people's brains might start working -- and then what? A bunch of reporters would learn they've wasted their youth on nonsense, that's what!So when it comes to the most frequently heard noise, let's take a trip down the well of diminishing returns, shall we?Hillary Clinton is very wealthy, which could become a (first-world) problem.As you may have heard, Clinton is a world-famous political celebrity with a world-famous political celebrity husband and a daughter who -- well, let's face it, it's hard to fathom her not becoming a world-famous political celebrity nepotism beneficiary even if she didn't want to, but she's surely turning into the skid. Clinton gets paid insane amounts of money to make speeches, and she gets book deals as easily as most people put on socks in the morning. Clinton's life is good. And frankly, it's a little weird, compared to rest of ours. It's especially disconcerting to hear her say, for example, that she and Bill were ""dead broke"" when she left the White House, because that's just crackers. It's given rise to a persistent question: ""Is Hillary Clinton out of touch with America?"" (Which is hilarious, considering it a question that mainly issues from the word-holes of teevee pundits and columnists who have heretofore shown no evidence that they themselves have actually met a single unemployed person or member of the rapidly-shrinking middle class.)This all comes at a time when Thomas Piketty's Capital In the Twenty-First Century is a sales smash, and income inequality is being discussed in all quarters. And there are useful questions that can and should be put to Hillary Clinton, considering that it was during her husband's presidency that many decisions were made that set the stage for the 2008 financial crisis (Commodity Futures Modernization Act ring a bell?). In terms of Clinton's policy proposals, it would be useful to gauge how much she has reflected upon the hard choices her husband now rues.Unfortunately, the next time someone asks that sort of question will be the first time. Income inequality is not going to be solved by reforming the paid-speaker circuit or by expanding access to it. And I can conceive of no presidential candidate emerging from either party as a nominee who won't be from the hyper-affluent, ""me and my family will want for nothing for the rest of our lives"" class of super-duper-lucky ducks. The possibility of getting a presidential candidate who is ""in touch with America"" is precisely nil. (But the possibility of getting a presidential candidate in touch with Sheldon Adelson is an entirely different story !)So, write this down: The longer the media stays focused on asking about speaking fees and whether someone pumps their own gas, the better the chance they entirely bypass the income inequality issue during the election, setting normal Americans back years.There doesn't seem to be much of a ""Clinton campaign"" yet. This is a huge concern!No, it's not. But that doesn't stop the waste of pixels. Here's Politico:For all the talk about how 2016 will have to be different from 2008 in terms of staffing and advisers, Clinton is still subsisting on a tiny infrastructure. The press team is small, and she has few paid advisers. She outsourced the work of managing surrogates during the book tour to longtime allies. But she has no polling operation to test what she’s saying and no raft of campaign advisers instructing her answers.Oh no, that can only last for so long, everybody! Good thing it's July of 2014, the very definition of ""you have a super long time to build a campaign infrastructure."" Right now, it would be unbelievably stupid for Hillary Clinton to have a huge campaign staff. You have to pay all those people! (Jeez, no wonder campaign reporters don't understand the economy.)This is an especially odd concern considering the fact that during the 2008 campaign, the same sorts of reporters were extremely concerned about how huge Clinton's campaign staff was, how much money they were spending, and how quickly they were spending it.Wow, guys, is Hillary Clinton ""moving away"" from Obama, that's significant, OMG.Well, it's significant in that we can now declare the era of ""Hillary Clinton should switch places with Joe Biden to set herself up for a run in 2016"" thought-farts to be over. Time of death: whenever it was that this Wall Street Journal editorial was published:Mrs. Clinton hasn't repudiated Mr. Obama, who made her secretary of state in his first term, and comments aimed at highlighting her differences with Mr. Obama are often implied rather than stated bluntly.This is a significant challenge for Clinton, but the more logical thing to say is that this is the significant challenge for any Democratic nominee, all of whom will have to navigate the terrain of Obama's presidency and decide which points of similarity and which contrasts they want to play up. NBC's ""First Read"" gang put it rather well:There’s an assumption by many longtime Clinton watchers that she will do what she can to distance herself from Obama, but so did George H.W. Bush in 1988 (re: Reagan) and Al Gore in 2000 (re: Clinton). Every eventual nominee having to run while their own party has held the presidency for two terms or longer has to strike that balance of finding ways to be different than the person they want to succeed without alienating the political base that obviously was responsible for delivering a two-term presidency in the first place.One would-be candidate, former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer (D), has decided to distinguish himself from Obama by suggesting that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) sounds like he is gay, thus proving that just because you can ""move away"" from Obama, it doesn't mean you necessarily should.Hillary Clinton has to ""move away"" from Bill Clinton.Like I said before, it would be really enlightening to know how her husband's presidency has informed Hillary Clinton's policy choices. But, hey, what if she just straight-up stuck Bill Clinton down in some root cellar instead? That would be even better, right? Well, this is something that Margaret Carlson got actual money to write for Bloomberg View:Bill Clinton didn’t help her become president in 2008, and he won’t be much help in 2016, except as a warm, supportive presence who, in our imagination, will inhabit the East Wing as a benign elder statesman, giving gentle advice only when prodded.The thing about ""The Political Narrative"" is that it's often just a silly bit of sophistry constructed to allow for future empty-headed shenanigans. Obviously, there is no way for Hillary Clinton to become sufficiently separated from Bill Clinton, unless there is some tragedy looming about which I have no knowledge. But suffice it to say, if Hillary Clinton succeeds in pushing Bill Clinton so far into the background that everyone agrees he's been sufficiently faded, then at the first sign of trouble -- a slipping approval rating, a weak stump appearance, a bad swing-state poll -- everyone will castigate Hillary Clinton for not having her husband sufficiently involved in her campaign. (Carlson will probably write that piece, too. That's just how presidential campaign coverage works.)Where's the ""big campaign idea"" in this book she's written, I can't find it! Doesn't she know she needs to have a big campaign idea?Oy. Back to Politico:The “Hard Choices” book tour has had all the trappings of a warm-up for 2016, and even though Clinton insists she hasn’t decided yet, she keeps dropping hints that she has ideas for the future of the country. “You’ve got to ask people who want to run for anything, but particularly president, what’s your vision? What is your vision for our country, and do you think you can lead us there?” Clinton said at a CNN “town hall” forum.Okay, calm down. It's actually not necessary for Hillary Clinton to have a big idea to run on yet, because if we recall, she does not have a campaign at the moment. Yes, she still needs to ""spell one out,"" but that's something she has many months to accomplish.More to the point: Think about what you are writing. The ""big idea"" is not in her book? Well, no kidding, genius. If there is to be a ""big idea,"" then Hillary Clinton is going to want this subsection of the population called ""normal human American registered voters"" to know about it. So this is not going to be a thing she puts in Hard Choices. The demographic for Hard Choices is not ""normal human American registered voters."" It is ""people who are huge, huge Hillary Clinton fans"" and ""reporters who were forced by their editors to read this book."" The former group won't need any further ""big idea"" from Clinton. The latter will have ample opportunity to ridicule it. So all in good time.Naturally, we have that trademarked Politico moment where the premise of the article is refuted by the reporting of the article:She may be able to resolve that tension by nodding to both camps, as she did at the Aspen Ideas Festival last week. Clinton sounded a populist tone, saying Americans should “feel they have a stake in the future and that the economy and political system is not stacked against them.” But she also spoke to more general, middle-class anxieties: “Of course, you have to work hard. Of course, you have to take responsibility. But we’re making it so difficult for people who do those things to feel that they’re going to achieve the American dream.”Dunno guys, but if you're searching for some ""big idea,"" then that seems to be what's colloquially referred to as a ""clue.""Of course, that's not the only significant question that's resulted from the book tour. Let's go back to the ""First Read"" gang, here found going off the rails a wee bit by asking if Clinton should have ""delayed her book tour and political re-entry"":One thing is pretty obvious when you look at Hillary Clinton’s fav/unfav scores in our NBC/WSJ poll: Her numbers have come back down to earth since leaving her secretary of state position. In Jan. 2013, her fav/unfav was 56%-25% (+31); in April 2013, it was 56%-29% (+27); in June 2013, it was 49%-31% (+18); in Sept. 2013, it was 51%-31% (+20), in March 2014, it was 44%-34% (+10); in April 2014, it was 48%-32% (+16); and last month after her book tour began, it was 44%-37% (+7). That slight but steady erosion begs the question: If she’s planning a 2016 run, should Clinton have delayed her book tour and political re-entry, given that her numbers would start declining as soon as she was viewed as a more political actor (see the book tour) than as a non-political actor (secretary of state)? On the one hand, that erosion has taken place maybe a bit faster than many had anticipated. On the other hand, with all the early attention on 2016 -- book tour or no book tour -- the numbers were probably going to go down, since the erosion is primarily coming from GOP respondents and right-leaning independents. There’s one other potential plus to the 2014 book tour: She’s answered every question, and has had everyone kick her tires. If you’re going to run, don’t you go ahead and get that out of the way?Hey, First Read, you guys seem to have not really made up your mind on the matter and have confused your readership for a therapist. But let's break this down: There has been wild speculation about a Clinton run dating back to what, 2011? Even before that? (Like, say, 1996?) And the media has been straight fiending for a taste of what's to come? And now you're worried that it's come too soon? In other words, this food is bland, and the portions are too small! Well, you guys are the ones who cooked and served it. [Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"

Waste on this scale occurs every day in many U.S. fisheries, hurting both fishermen and marine life.",2014-07-11,"ILULISSAT, GREENLAND - JULY 22: A crab and halibut are seen in a bin after being caught by fisherman, Nikolaj Sandgreen, on July 22, 2013 in Ilulissat, Greenland. As the sea levels around the globe rise, researchers affilitated with the National Science Foundation and other organizations are studying the phenomena of the melting glaciers and its long-term ramifications. The warmer temperatures that have had an effect on the glaciers in Greenland also have altered the ways in which the local populace farm, fish, hunt and even travel across land. In recent years, sea level rise in places such as Miami Beach has led to increased street flooding and prompted leaders such as New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to propose a $19.5 billion plan to boost the citys capacity to withstand future extreme weather events by, among other things, devising mechanisms to withstand flooding. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d2bb68260000132951dd97.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The fishing industry is an important part of the U.S. economy. In 2012, commercial fishermen landed almost 10 billion pounds of fish worth more than $5 billion. What would you say, though, if you found out that some U.S. fishermen were throwing nearly half of their catch back overboard, because they were only allowed to keep certain species? And what if you heard that other fishermen were unintentionally catching large numbers of vulnerable marine animals like dolphins, whales, and sea turtles -- damaging gear and hurting their own bottom lines?Waste on this scale occurs every day in many U.S. fisheries, hurting both fishermen and marine life. A new report by Oceana recently revealed the economic losses from this wasted catch -- an amount that could reach a staggering $1 billion annually. Fishermen typically target a specific type of fish, but some types of fishing gear catch many other marine creatures. This unintentionally caught seafood, known as bycatch, is often thrown overboard and wasted, either because it is too small to keep, is poorer quality, or is less valuable than the targeted fish. Some U.S. fisheries actually throw away more fish than they keep, sometimes discarding their target fish if they exceed their quota, or even discarding another fishermen's target fish. Researchers estimate that an average of 20 percent of what is caught in the U.S. is thrown away each year, wasting approximately 2 billion pounds of seafood, the equivalent of nearly half a billion seafood meals. Bycatch also results in the deaths of tens of thousands of sea turtles, whales, dolphins, and seals. Oceana's new report, ""Wasted Cash,"" shows that bycatch costs fishermen time, gear, and access to healthy fish stocks, which adds up to a significant amount of lost money and jobs. The report examined economic losses in three main regions: the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, New England and the Mid-Atlantic, and Alaska and the Pacific Coast. Fisheries in the southeast region discard popular seafood like shrimp, grouper, snapper, tuna, and swordfish. Fisheries in Alaska and the Pacific are discarding other dinner favorites, like halibut and crabs, while fisheries in New England and the Mid-Atlantic region waste sea scallops and flounder, including $25 million worth of fish discarded in the region's bottom trawl fisheries.Discarding fish is akin to throwing money or perfectly good food into the ocean. Most successful businesses in the U.S. strive to cut waste and increase efficiency, and fisheries should do the same. Many fishermen have the means and knowledge to make these changes, but lack the economic incentives that would compel them to follow through. Oceana developed a three-part solution to reduce bycatch and limit this wasted cash: ""Count, Cap and Control."" First, all species caught in a fishery, including bycatch, should be counted. Accurate and precise data are essential for avoiding the negative consequences of overfishing and lost future revenue. Next, we need to set limits, or ""caps."" Establishing bycatch limits is critical for maintaining healthy fish populations, and helps fishermen avoid financial losses from continued overfishing. And finally, fisheries managers should control and minimize bycatch by enforcing bycatch limits and finding incentives to change behavior, including real-time reporting, cleaner gear, time-area management, bycatch reduction devices, or other emerging economic tools.Bycatch threatens more than just the bottom line -- it puts the future resilience of ocean ecosystems at risk. With your help, Oceana is working to put our ""Count, Cap and Control"" solution in place to protect fishermen, fisheries and marine life."
2,POLITICS,"Hobby Lobby, Climate Change, and the GOP's Women Problem","Heather Taylor-Miesle, ContributorExecutive Director, Ohio Environmental Council",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hobby-lobby-climate-chang_b_5578084.html,When did climate change become a women's issue? When women made it clear they care deeply about it. Women in battleground states understand (by a margin of 72 percent to 19 percent) that we have a moral obligation to future generations to make the air safer to breathe and the climate more stable.,2014-07-11,"FILE - In this May 22, 2013, customers enter and exit a Hobby Lobby store in Denver. The Supreme Court is poised to deliver its verdict in a case that weighs the religious rights of employers and the right of women to the birth control of their choice. Employers must cover contraception for women at no extra charge among a range of preventive benefits in employee health plans. Dozens of companies, including the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby, claim religious objections to covering some or all contraceptives. (AP Photo/Ed Andrieski, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cf7624000051005770cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than 200 women brought their children to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to urge lawmakers to clean up the air pollution that causes climate change. The event was called a ""Play-in for Climate Action"" -- you can't expect all those kids to stay still for a traditional ""sit-in"" -- and included a press conference with Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI).Around the same time, GOP lawmakers in the House were busy drafting a bill that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from doing the very thing those mothers want: clean up carbon pollution from power plants so their children have a better future.Welcome to the latest battle in the Tea Party's war on women. This conflict isn't getting as much attention as the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby ruling, but it could play a significant role in who wins and loses the midterm elections.Republican and Democratic candidates have already worked the Hobby Lobby case into stump speeches, fundraising appeals, and attack ads. Yet few people will vote on the Hobby Lobby ruling alone. Most voters cast ballots based on a cluster of issues that matter most to them.One negative story about a Tea Party position that hurts women would not turn the midterm tide. But these days, the stories are mounting. GOP candidates are alienating women voters on a host of issues, from reproductive health to equal pay to climate change.When did climate change become a women's issue? When women made it clear they care deeply about it. Women in battleground states understand (by a margin of 72 percent to 19 percent) that we have a moral obligation to future generations to make the air safer to breathe and the climate more stable. Climate change increases smog and contributes to asthma attacks and other respiratory problems. If we don't act now, the next generation will pay a steep price, and most women want children to inherit a brighter future, not one plagued by unchecked climate hazards.And yet nearly every single Republican candidate running for office in the past few years -- from the presidential level on down -- has ignored, denied, or belittled the threat of climate change. Right now, GOP leaders are attacking the EPA's new ""Clean Power Plan."" This plan would unleash wind and solar power, boost energy and cost savings, and finally hold power plants accountable for the enormous amounts of carbon pollution they spew into our air.Blocking this kind of climate action isn't just bad policy; it's bad politics.Women are one of the emerging voting blocs that will matter most in this election, along with Latinos and young people. Many female voters are likely to view Tea Party stance on climate change as yet another position that turns them off.Republicans can't afford that. In the 2012 presidential race, women favored the Democratic ticket by 11 percentage points. Unmarried women voted for President Obama over Governor Romney by 67 percent. Those single women, it turns out, could be the soccer moms of this election -- top Democratic strategists are already trying to appeal to them.Some Republicans may be listening to what women want. Over the past few months, GOP leaders have hedged their climate bets; they have moved from outright denial to modest demurral. Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), Governor Rick Scott (R-FL), and Presidential hopeful Marco Rubio (R-FL) have all said they don't have the scientific background to assess the risks of climate change. This hardly constitutes a bold approach to a matter of national security, but it does suggest some Republicans realize that climate denunciation is a losing position.Candidates who stand for climate action, meanwhile, can cast themselves as champions of clean air, public health, good jobs, and a brighter future for our children -- a set of issues that appeal to many women voters."
3,ENTERTAINMENT,Is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movie Missing A Big Opportunity?,"John Dick, ContributorCivicScience, Inc.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles_b_5578363.html,"Paramount and Nickelodeon Movies could be missing a big opportunity if they launch the movie with a PG-13 rating. As it stands, it doesn't look like parents are planning to add this movie to their summer blockbuster must-see list, at least not with their kids. Let's see how it plays out.",2014-07-11,2014-07-11-teenagemutantninjaturtlesmoviecomingaugust.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-11-teenagemutantninjaturtlesmoviecomingaugust-thumb.png,"Turtles. Teenage Ones. Mutant ninjas at that. We can only imagine what was being smoked by the comic book artists who first conceived of the idea exactly 30 years ago, long before the legalization of such things was sweeping the country. Surely, when Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird hatched the concept, they could never have dreamed it would spawn a three-decade run of comic books, television shows, figurines, video games, movies, breakfast cereals, and even a concert tour. On August 8, the reptilian franchise will debut its fifth feature film, potentially snagging an entirely new generation of young fans, while appealing to the nostalgic geek-dom of GenXers who flocked to theaters in 1990 for the first installment. Some older fans of TMNT aren't taking the bait but many certainly will, if under the guise of ""oh I'm just taking my kids."" So, with the movie's opening weekend about a month away, we wanted to examine the likely audience that will be drawn to the theater for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles this go-around. What do they look like? And, while certainly all of the film's cross-promotion and licensing deals were inked long ago, what brands and advertisers line up best with the likely movie-goer? Here's what we found:   A survey of 7,431 U.S. consumers age 13 and older allowed us to find 458 people who said they are ""Very likely"" to see the film and another 914 who said they are ""Somewhat likely."" Interestingly, we saw no difference between the sexes. Men and women were equally inclined to see the film.The big proxy, as you might expect, was age. Check out the chart below:As you can see, younger respondents were far more likely to express an interest in seeing the movie compared to their older counterparts. The incidence of ""Very likely"" responses peaked among 25-29 year-olds, with a precipitous decline visible among the older age groups. This 25-29 peak is surprising, in part, because people aged 13-24 are the most frequent movie-goers in general. Perhaps more surprising, however, is that we saw no noticeable spike among parents. Only 21 percent of parents, versus 22 percent of non-parents, are either very likely or somewhat likely to see the film. These numbers could be explained by the movie's rumored, but not yet confirmed, PG-13 rating. Another big discovery is that the film is clearly appealing more to minorities in the US. A full 34 percent of Hispanics and 28 percent of African-Americans are very/somewhat likely to see the movie; this compares to just 16 percent of Whites/Caucasians. Marketers take note. But what else did we find? Clearly, the film is appealing to a technically-savvy group of consumers. Seventy percent of likely film-watchers say they closely follow technology trends, compared to just 46 percent of the non-watchers. The movie is definitely set up well for a video game spin-off. Thirty-two percent of likely film-goers play video games at least weekly compared to just 18 percent of the non-goers. Mobile word-of-mouth could make or break the movie. When asked what form of communications they use most with friends and family, the likely viewers are 18 times more likely to say they use mobile messaging apps -- that's right 18 times. They're almost 4 times more likely to use SnapChat than the non-viewers.TMNT fans love EDM (that's Electronic Dance Music). No celebrity or artist over-indexed more in popularity among likely movie-goers than David Guetta, the French DJ. But it's worth noting that they're not likely to be seen wearing a pair of Beats by Dr. Dre headphones. Twenty-three percent of likely movie-goers dislike the Beats brand, versus just 12 percent who like it.More on brands below, but one thing that jumped out was the propensity of TMNT likely watchers to eat at fast casual restaurants like Panera or Noodles & Company. The film-goers are 4 times more likely than non-goers to eat at a fast casual joint at least once a week or more. Hopefully, the movie's cross-promotional team figured that out long ago. On a related note, the movie audience is also 3.5 times more likely to buy organic. They're also fit. Fifty-one percent of the likely audience exercise at a gym, versus 30 percent of the non-audience. One big opportunity (or risk) for the movie is the reverb it could see on social media after opening weekend. Sixty-one percent of likely attendees say they share entertainment news and content on social media, compared to just 38 percent of non-attendees. If the movie is awesome, or if it's terrible, word could spread extremely fast.So, what does this all mean to advertisers? We looked at hundreds of different brands we track to see which ones were most and least popular with likely TMNT movie-goers, compared to the general population. Below are the top ten brands that over- and under-index in popularity:  These two charts show a consistent theme in the brand affinities of TMNT's likely audience. Casual and fast-casual dining, mid-market apparel and sporting goods, packaged goods, and caffeine drinks are a huge hit with this crowd. Higher-end grocers, big box retail, and cars -- with the notable exception of Jeep -- not so much. As the major marketing push for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie hits full stride in the coming weeks, it will be interesting to see how the film's corporate partners match up with these lists. Already, word was made public of a partnership with Pizza Hut. That looks like a winning combination according to our data -- people who are the most likely to attend the movie in theaters are a full 321 percent more likely than average to say they ""Love"" Pizza Hut. Paramount and Nickelodeon Movies could be missing a big opportunity if they launch the movie with a PG-13 rating. As it stands, it doesn't look like parents are planning to add this movie to their summer blockbuster must-see list, at least not with their kids. Let's see how it plays out."

Nash joined members of Congress in advocating for changes in federal law banning the interstate trade of primates. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15a5c3c000032000bcad3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yesterday, I shared the podium on Capitol Hill with the brave Charla Nash who, five years ago, suffered one of the most extensive and life-changing animal attacks in American history. After being called to help calm her boss' adult male pet chimpanzee Travis at home, Nash suffered a disfiguring attack from the powerful 200-pound animal that left her barely alive.For the first time in Washington, she told her story, advocating for the swift passage of the Captive Primate Safety Act, S. 1463/H.R. 2856, which seeks to ban the interstate transport of primates for the pet trade.In February of 2009, the enraged Travis bit off Charla's hands and toes and essentially tore off her face before a police officer shot Travis to save his own life. Travis suffered a mortal wound and staggered into his home and died in his bed minutes later.As Congressman Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., said yesterday, the House passed his bill to ban the trade in primates as pets in 2008, but the Senate failed to act. Just as our push for a national no-downer policy in 2003 preceded the finding of a downer cow in the food supply some months later -- and a major disruption in world beef markets -- our warning about inaction in stemming the trade in primates as pets preceded the grisly and tragic circumstance of Ms. Nash and Travis in Connecticut.Sensible policy action should not require these sorts of cataclysmic outcomes. But to have these sorts of events, and then to fail to act on policy reforms to prevent these tragedies from happening again, compounds the gravity of the inaction by Congress.Connecticut's two U.S. senators, Democrats Dick Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, in joining Blumenauer and House lead sponsor Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, R-PA. at today's event, said a similar thing. They said they'd use all their power to shepherd this legislation through Congress, in honor of their one-time constituent. You can help by calling your U.S. senators and representatives and asking them to pass the Captive Primate Safety Act.Charla is as compelling an advocate for any bill as I've ever seen. And yesterday she told a wall of reporters and TV cameras that she doesn't want anyone to suffer the same fate she did. Who can argue with that from this modest and courageous woman?This article first appeared on Wayne Pacelle's blog, A Humane Nation."

Reed made the comments about former nonprofit CEO Michelle Nunn, who is running for Senate, and state Sen. Jason Carter, who is running for governor, in an interview with Georgia Public Broadcasting reporter Bill Nigut. Reed said the Democratic strategy of waiting until late in the election cycle to reach out to black voters would not help Carter beat Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) or Nunn in her bid against either Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) or businessman David Perdue. “If someone calls on me at that point, I’m not going to be too responsive to that because I think that’s offensive and I think it’s the old way,” he said. “What needs to happen is you have to communicate with all your constituencies at the exact same time through election day.”Reed also had advice for Carter and Nunn about their get-out-the-vote tactics and ground game, saying they would have to heavily invest in voter contact efforts. “And if they haven’t invested, I would say somewhere between 3 to 5 million [dollars] in their registration efforts and in their voter contact efforts, I don’t believe they are going to prevail,” he told Georgia Public Broadcasting. Reed's message is one he has been emphasizing consistently for months: in June, he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Democrats would only have a shot if they helped with a party effort to vastly expand the electorate in the state. “At the end of the day, no matter what the polls say, the election is going to be determined by the registration effort in the state of Georgia,” Reed said. While the relationship between Reed and Carter has been described as ""chilly,"" the mayor has been an enthusiastic supporter of Nunn's candidacy.

Invariably, I find myself delving into the same themes time and again. The nature of the conflict remains the same. You coexist, and short of self-inflicted catastrophe, you are destined to coexist until the end of time. You must now choose to live in harmony and peace, or in self-consuming enmity and hate.No Israeli or Palestinian child should ever die for a cause that defies reality and reason. Taking teens hostage and horrifically killing them in cold blood, or abducting a child and grisly burning him alive defies your religious beliefs and the basic tenets of your humanity. Like beasts, the militant madmen among you creep in the shadows for their prey, to satisfy their lust for revenge and retribution. They disgrace you as a people and a nation, while poisoning the next generations with hostility and disdain, robbing them of their future and destroying the little hope left to live in harmony and peace.A majority of you Israelis and Palestinians are crying out for peace, yearning still for that elusive day when you can retire to bed without fear and face tomorrow excited about what lies ahead. Every day that exacts blood and torments so many is a day when your graves are dug ever deeper, burying innocent children and any hope for a better future. The gap between you grows ever wider, feeding the vicious cycle of death and destruction. Instead of reaching out compassionately, you obliterate the last traces of empathy toward one another, knowing that there is no place to go but together.You, the so-called leaders, are the culprits behind this miserable state of being. Immersed in blind ideology or misguided religious dogmas and possessed by a messianic mission, you incite your people and fan the flames of acrimony and violence. Shame on you Naftali Bennett, you are a zealous madman. You want to annex much of the West Bank and openly preach the invasion of Gaza. You proclaim that war with Hamas is inevitable and ""It's preferable that we're [the Israelis] the ones who initiate it."" You are a menace to the people of Israel whom you presumably wish to protect. It is alright that hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians die as long as you continue to amass fortunes and enjoy the opulence that life can offer.And what about you, Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' misguided leader, you are a fanatic fool who refuses to see the light. You extolled the kidnapping of the three Israeli youth, you call for another Intifada and encourage ""the escalation of the resistance,"" only to watch thousands of Palestinians die as sacrificial lambs to satisfy your twisted ego and hollow religious convictions.And Israel's Deputy Defense Minister Danny Danon, you have long since lost your moral bearings; unabashedly you advocate collective punishment of the Palestinians, proudly announcing: ""If terrorists find refuge among Palestinians, then Palestinians will pay the price."" Khaled Meshal, Hamas' brazen political leader, you encourage more abduction of Israelis and with venom you ""congratulate"" the abductors as if this is the recipe to be ""[free] from the prisons of the occupation."" You invite more misery on so many innocent Palestinians, who simply want to live a normal life devoid of constant anguish and pain.Prime Minister Netanyahu, you cannot hide behind your tempered reaction to the abduction of the three Israeli teenagers and your expressions of sympathy to the family of the young Palestinian boy who was beaten and set on fire. You are now reaping the fruits of your relentless expansionism and blind ideological bent.You have created this untenable situation between you and the Palestinians and largely contributed to the impasse and the hopelessness of ever reaching a peace agreement.This is your plight, Israelis and Palestinians alike; you are led by inept, self-centered leaders with no vision and no courage. Have you ever paused and asked the simple question: Where do we go from here? None of you -- Bennett, Haniyeh, Netanyahu, Meshal, and Abbas -- know what will be the fate of Israel and Palestine in five or 10 years should you continue to pursue your bankrupt policy. You, Israelis and Palestinian leaders and people, must come to terms with the harsh reality you refuse to face. You are stuck; there is no escape and no future without the other.You radical Palestinians who seek the destruction of Israel will do so at your peril. Israel is here to stay and will never die alone. And you Israeli zealots who conspire to thwart the Palestinians' aspiration for a state of their own will irreparably erode Israel as a Jewish state. Israel will become a garrison state, isolated and loathed by the community of nations.Paradoxically, Netanyahu and Abbas, you can still change the current perilous path. If you truly desire to achieve peace based on a two-state solution, then prove it by rising to the call of the hour and reverse the tragedies of recent days into a triumph over the evil of extremism. This is the time when you must stand tall together and proclaim your unshakable commitment to realize peace now, in our time. You have the moral responsibility to make the sacrifice of innocent Israeli and Palestinian children whose lives were cut short the catalyst for peace and not the cause of more violence and death.Netanyahu, you can no longer use the potential fall of your coalition government as an excuse for making gratuitous concessions to the Palestinians. Do not listen to the hawks and invade Gaza time and again. Once the calm is restored, you must muster the courage, dissolve your government and form a new coalition dedicated to the path of peace. In spite of your past mistakes, you still possess the leadership qualities needed now to prevent the looming disaster. This could be your long career's finest hour, or the hour of infamy and shame for failing to rise above the fray.Abbas, you too must make the hard choice. Whereas your unity government is preferred for peace negotiations, you must demand that Hamas adhere to the rules of engagement and no longer permit Hamas to have it both ways. You must insist that Hamas's leaders forsake violence once and for all, or dump them to wallow in their own morass. They will pay dearly for betraying their fellow Palestinians in Gaza, who are despairing for a taste of freedom and a glimmer of hope.You, Israelis and Palestinians of conscience, must now raise your voices and be heard loud and clear: enough is enough, no more bloodshed, no more waste of precious lives, no more tears and heartbroken mothers and fathers.The time has come for you to strive for peace as the continuation of conflict will never yield a winner but mutual death and destruction. There is no glory, no heroism, no dignity and no martyrdom in death, when peace is within your grasp."

Saudi Arabia pledged $500 million in humanitarian aid for Iraq to be disbursed through the United Nations to those in need regardless of sect or ethnicity, state media reported. AFP PHOTO/SAFIN HAMED (Photo credit should read SAFIN HAMED/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1c7343c000032000beb5f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The 21st century's U.S. foreign policy and action -- or more accurately, reaction -- has been driven by fear. Terrorism. And as taxpayers, we have paid a heavy price to fear. To date, the United States has spent more than $25 billion training and equipping the Iraq army. Now, after a war that has cost us trillions of dollars and too many lives, President Obama has asked Congress for half a billion dollars to train and equip yet another army -- Syrian opposition fighters, as an alternative to ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. ISIS, a terrorist group so brutal that they were disowned by al Qaeda, is at the forefront of today's international news as the Islamist militants seizing cities in the cradle of civilization. In captured towns, they have forced marriages and raped. They have also publicly displayed brutal killings of women who did not obey their strict rules and cover their faces.Now, how about we change this paradigm? Rather than continuing to react to fear, how about we develop a foreign-policy strategy that is based on a long-term vision rooted in love? Furthermore, rather than spending the $500 million training just fighters, how about we invest it cultivating another kind of force that can truly change the tide?Ironically, for almost 3,500 years, Isis was a goddess of love. Embodying motherhood and empowered femininity, she was one of the most important deities in ancient Egypt, revered far and wide from England to Afghanistan.Furthermore, there is, remarkably, powerful and yet, un-harnessed human force in the world. Tomorrow's women leaders are today's adolescent girls and young women in Iraq, Syria and many other countries whose leadership potential is thwarted by fundamental ideologies and harmful cultural norms. So how about we use the funds to develop an army of empowered femininity -- the next generation of women leaders in the exact same places where these terrorists reign? According to the World Bank, the single highest return on investment in the developing world is girls. For every year a girl receives primary education, her earning potential is boosted 10 to 20 percent. Even more, secondary education increases a girl's income by 15 to 25 percent per year.The evidence is overwhelming. It is proven that young women share 90 percent of their earnings with their families, compared to only 30 to 40 percent for young men. And if we close the gender gap in employment, a nation's GDP would increase by 1.2 percent in just one year. The impact, for example, is $13.9 billion -- in a single year -- into the economy of Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and where another terrorist group, Boko Haram, is forcibly silencing girls' and young women's voices and education.We must not only educate girls; we must shift the paradigm of how girls in the developing world are perceived -- from valueless victims to powerful agents of change. We can help them become tomorrow's leaders who will transform their societies as political leaders, business owners and mothers who will educate their children and have healthier children. Why care? Why now?The largest in history, 1.8 billion young people are on the planet today. Ninety percent of this enormous human force is in the developing world, and they are the fastest-growing population segment. In fact, young people make up the largest proportion of the population in the Middle East and North Africa. So the time is NOW to change the course and take action. The power of youth can be continually harnessed by terrorists with anti-American and anti-Western agendas, or it can be nurtured to build vibrant civil societies. This money will go a long way in the development of tomorrow's women leaders -- much further than training war-makers. Additionally, we will be equipping a generation to create powerful and lasting change where these terrorists breed and reign with a ripple effect in the region and a positive impact in our own national security.Albert Einstein said, ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."" Are we going to keep reacting to fear or boldly lead with love? "

Clinton has published the book in what many believe is the beginning of another bid for the presidency. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cf5e240000510098f401.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The reviews are in on Hard Choices, Hillary Clinton's history of her four-year tenure as U.S. secretary of state. They are almost all positive. Her book sales are strong -- No. 1 on The New York Times best-sellers list for three weeks in a row. What is missing from most of the reviews is what the book reveals about Clinton the person. I can speak to that, knowing her since I was a senior and she was a freshman at Yale Law School when we first met in the fall of 1969. First, to state the most obvious: Hard Choices is about Hillary working hard. We have all read the data of her travels and meetings as secretary of state: 401 days on the road, one million miles traveled, 112 countries visited. The book depicts the results of that hard work, her enduring achievements as secretary of state, including her indefatigable personal shuttle diplomacy between Israel and Egypt, which led to a cease-fire between Israel and the Hamas-led Palestinians in Gaza, saving countless lives; her determined negotiations with Russia, which led to a reduction in U.S.-Russian nuclear missiles with better verification; and her successful effort to obtain global cooperation imposing economic sanctions on Iran, widely credited with bringing Iran to the negotiating table regarding its nuclear weapons program.  Then there is Hillary the strong and decisive leader, who made difficult judgments based on the available facts, taking the risk that, with the wisdom of hindsight, she might turn out to be wrong. The most dramatic example, described in page-turning detail in her book, was her support of President Obama's courageous decision to send in the Navy SEALs to kill Osama bin Laden, a decision opposed by Vice President Biden.Finally, the book conveys the positive global effects of her authenticity and likeability. In my view, one of Clinton's most enduring achievements as secretary of state -- maybe the most important -- was the dramatic increase in positive perceptions of American leadership around the world during her tenure. In the last two years of the Bush administration, according to Gallup World Poll data, America trailed Britain, France, Germany, Japan and China in approval of its leadership. That's right, behind even China. In 2011, after two years of Clinton as secretary of State, America was tied for first place with Germany. Finally, several sentences in the last two chapters of her book convey core insights into the real Hillary Clinton that her long-time friends have understood over the years. When Obama asked her to stay into the second term, she wrote that she ""felt the tug of my 'service gene,' that voice telling me there is no higher calling or more noble purpose than serving your country."" But then made she made the decision to return to private life -- ""spending more time with my family, reconnecting with friends, doing the everyday things I missed.""She also wrote poignantly about her thoughts at her mom's funeral: ""I looked at Chelsea and thought about how proud Mom was of her. Mom measured her own life by how much she was able to help us and serve others. I knew if she was still with us, she would be urging us to do the same. Never rest on your laurels. Never quit. Never stop working to make the world a better place. That's our unfinished business.""The first time I met Hillary Rodham in September 1969, we were standing in line to register for classes at Yale Law School. I asked her if she needed any advice on how to study and brief cases in her first semester at a fairly challenging law school. She said, politely, ""no, thank you,"" and then asked: ""Can you tell me where I can find the nearest legal services clinic?""No, Hillary Clinton hasn't changed through all the years: the importance of family and friends, the ""service gene"" as active today as I witnessed some 45 years ago, motivating her to ""never quit -- never stop working to make the world a better place.""   # # # # #  This column appears first and weekly in The Hill and the Hill.com.

She fled to Bangladesh 5 months ago from the Dhuachopara village in the Rachidhong district of Myanmar. The Chakma people came on a Friday during prayer time in a giant mob and started burning houses and burning people alive. They beat her father and brother, and then they opened fired and started shooting and killing people at random. A group of people fled to the mosque and the Chakma followed, opening fire inside. Her father fled to the ocean and escaped to Bangladesh by boat. Rajama came to Bangladesh 3 days after the riot to find her father. When she arrived in the port of Teknaf the dock workers held her captive for 3 days with no food or water. They beat her and abused her before letting her go. She has 7 siblings back in Myanmar who were not able to escape. 'I miss my family, but how can I miss them? I want to live.' she says. Last week Tomas Ojea Quintana, the UN special rapporteur on Human Rights, said that recent developments in Myanmar's Rakhine state were the latest in a 'long history of discrimination and persecution against the Rohingya Muslim community which could amount to crimes against humanity', and that the Myanmar government's decision not to allow Rohingya Muslims to register their ethnicity in the March census meant that the population tally was not in accordance with international standards. Over the years hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees have taken refuge in Bangladesh to escape the deadly sectarian violence in Myanmar. (Photo by Getty Images/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7eac12100000002c91a1b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bangladesh law minister Syed Anisul Haque announced on Thursday that the country would cease officiating marriages for Rohingya Muslims, an ethnic minority group that has been displaced from Myanmar due to persecution.The marriage ban affects Rohingyas attempting to wed one another and those seeking unions with Bangladeshi nationals, the Malaysian Insider reports. Haque claimed that Rohingyas seek marriages in order to obtain Bangladeshi passports and even citizenship for those marrying country nationals, which the ban would prevent.Marriage registrars face disciplinary action if they fail to comply, law ministry spokesman Abdullah Al Shahin said.Lifestyle restrictions are nothing new for Rohingya Muslims, who the U.N. considers to be among the most persecuted minority groups in the world. Rohingyas are denied citizenship in Myanmar, and more than 100,000 have fled their homes in recent years to escape brutal attacks -- often carried out by Buddhist extremists in the country.Because they lack citizenship in Myanmar, Rohingyas are unable to move, marry or find jobs without permission from the government. Despite the restrictions on marriage, Rohingya couples are only allowed to live together if they are married and then are subject to a strict two-child policy. Bearing children out of wedlock is prohibited.There are roughly 300,000 Rohingyas living in Bangladesh, though the country recognizes only about 30,000 who are eligible for food, housing and other basic aid provided by the U.N. Other Rohingya refugees are dispersed in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.""They live under open sky, with no support from the United Nations or the Bangladeshi government,"" human rights activist and Rohingya refugee Nijam Mohammed told Al Jazeera. ""People are dying every day, there is a lack of food, treatment and education. You can't imagine how life is.""Although the Rohingya say they originally come from western Myanmar, Buddhist extremists say they immigrated illegally from Bangladesh in the 1800s with British imperial troops. Bangladesh border guards regularly intercept Rohingyas attempting to cross the Myanmar border, though on either side Rohingyas risk discrimination, poor living conditions and even human trafficking."

But the program has been hampered by the concerns of many local law enforcement organizations that don't believe the program offers sufficient privacy protections.

It's a world view and narrative that is embedded in the identity and agenda of America's political right wing.",2014-07-10,"Megyn Kelly, host of Fox News Channel's ""The Kelly Files,"" rehearses for the debut of her new show, in New York, Friday, Oct. 4, 2013. Her program is the linchpin to the first overhaul of Fox's prime-time lineup since 2002, or about a century in television time. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5be143c000018010d04ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A dozen years ago, as the U.S. was pulled into war in Iraq by President George W. Bush, Fox News was not just any television network. It proudly blared the White House's lies coming with singular warmongering fervor. Remember? The terrorists had ties to Iraq. Saddam wanted the bomb. Saddam had the bomb. He could hit us in 45 minutes. Fox even overshadowed the pro-war New York Times, where with the help of Judith Miller, the paper spewed distortions, launched partisan attacks and slammed Bush's critics as naïve, unpatriotic traitors. Other media, and even members of Congress, followed Fox's lead. They all assumed that Fox was a legitimate news organization. It wasn't. Yet that mistake about Fox's power and impact was wreaking terrible consequences for our democracy and the media.I felt that Fox had to be exposed with facts and broadcast clips for what it was: a partisan propaganda shop masquerading as news network. Other media and the public had to be educated that Fox was acting as the media arm of the America's political right wing. It was anything but ""fair and balanced."" I knew what I wanted to do. I had made dozens of movies for TV, cable and feature films. We had to investigate Fox and expose it for what it was to real journalists. We could use new tools -- crowd-sourced investigations, digital video recorders, and editing software. We could distribute it using the Internet, online DVD sales and social media. In March 2003, America invaded Iraq. The following year was a presidential election. We had to move quickly and couldn't rely on traditional movie theatres or TV. We didn't. In July 2004, we released our documentary film, Outfoxed, which relies on Fox News' own words and methods to let people see Fox for what it was. Today, a decade later, we are re-releasing the film with a new section adding context. It's worth reflecting on what we did, the impact the film had, and what's left to do -- why it's still very relevant today. As Texas' tea party Sen. Ted Cruz said in a June New Yorker magazine profile, ""In both law and politics, I think the essential battle is the meta-battle of framing the narrative."" That perfectly describes Fox's mission: recast news from a right-wing perspective, only support Republican prescriptions, and attack the opposition. In Outfoxed, we showed how Fox does that so that Americans could understand how partisan propaganda works.We began by assembling a team that started watching Fox seven days a week. Our team, mostly volunteers recruited by MoveOn.org, followed shows and commentators. We taped everything, such as when Bill O'Reilly said we were winning in Iraq or when he stammered out vicious attacks on anti-war activists. We noted their rhetoric, tone, presentation, techniques and noticed something above all else: Fox's unattributed accusations. When Fox wanted to assert a right-wing talking point or use a guest as a prop to launch an attack, their hosts would say, again and again, ""Some people say..."" It's a clever ruse. The ""some people"" was Fox CEO Roger Ailes and his Republican friends. What they ""say"" was indistinguishable from political attack ads and smears.I remember seeing that for the first time in the editing room and almost fell off my chair. I was surprised at how often they did it. We also had sources inside Fox's newsroom who had grown weary of Fox's journalistic pretensions. They gave us dozens of memos from senior Fox editors. For the first time, we had written proof of Fox telling its reporters what to say and how to say it. Never say sniper in a script, the memos said, always say sharpshooter. Never mourn a soilder's death, its writers and analysts were told. They were the shock troops in a right-wing propaganda war. We learned we had to be careful. With the help of Larry Lessig, an intellectual property legal scholar and now a leading anti-political corruption campaigner, we vetted the clips we could use and not be sued by Fox, because, after all, they owned their broadcasts. In short, we learned the legal doctrine known as fair use, so Fox couldn't touch us. In the spring of 2004, as Fox attacked John Kerry, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, as French -- their shorthand for effeminate, dimplomatice and culturally elite -- we completed the finishing touches on the film that deconstructed its tactics and techniques. In July, we released Outfoxed and launched an unprecedented guerilla marketing campaign. We showed it in theaters, of course. We began selling thousands of DVDs online -- in the early days of Internet commerce. We partnered with MoveOn.org and started showing it at house parties. That had never been done before. MoveOn had more than 4,000 house parties with conference calls afterward. It built a groundswell. We sent DVDs to high schools, colleges and libraries. But in 2007, as the next presidential campaigns were getting underway, had still had to educate some mainstream Democrats.That spring, the Nevada Democratic Party was planning to host a presidential candidate on Fox News. We knew that hosting a Democratic candidate debate would lend credibility to Fox fraudulently depicting itself as a news organization, not a partisan front, and launched grassroots protests to stop it. With MoveOn's amazing energetic Adam Green, we prevailed. The candidates pulled out. There was no debate on Fox.All along, our goal wasn't to deter conservatives from watching Fox. We wanted to jar the herd mentality of editors and producers at other media who were prone to following Fox's lead. This was a battle to wrest control of the national news narrative away from the right-wing frames and bias that Fox used. We showed editors and Democrats who were giving Fox News the benefit of the doubt, that they were a partisan propaganda shop -- not a news organization. You can't be both and we demonstrated why. A lot has happened since releasing Outfoxed in 2004. But history has a way of moving in circles, if not exactly repeating itself. This June, as Iraq imploded into sectarian divisions, Fox was beating the old war drums again. As Hillary Clinton began her newest book tour, it has been pouncing on the presumed 2016 presidential candidate. As the Supreme Court just held that corporations have religious rights and employers do not have to include contraception in women's health plans, Fox taunts, ""You got a problem with that?"" But there's more to this than Fox's rants about Benghazi as the worst foreign policy crisis or their unending attacks on President Obama or the Clintons. They continue to weave a deeper narrative that's divisive and insidious. Their messaging that government is bad, that human nature is intrinsically more evil than good, that people should be afraid and paranoid, isn't journalism covering the news. It's a world view and narrative that is embedded in the identity and agenda of America's political right wing.So we are releasing an expanded version of Outfoxed, because Fox is still there. The partisan propaganda machinery is still spinning. All Americans, not just young reporters, editors and voters, need to be reminded what Fox News and political propaganda is about -- because we are all better off when we are not outfoxed."
