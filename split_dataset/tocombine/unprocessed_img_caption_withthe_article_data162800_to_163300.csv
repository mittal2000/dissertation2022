Lohan reportedly ripped the glittering Theia gown she wore to the Feb. 6 amfAR gala in New York City, according to Us Weekly. The actress allegedly tore the $1,750 dress in half after it ripped, and she returned it in tatters. ""She said that the dress had ripped [at a club after the fundraiser] -- she couldn't possibly wear it like that -- so her stylist friend went to the club bouncer and requested some scissors to repair the torn part of the dress,"" a source told Us Weekly. ""She turned it into a mullet! Only a fashiony person would do that! She's out of control and behaving really badly.""(FYI this is the same dress Charlie Sheen reportedly offered to pay for.) Lohan has a problem with taking care of and/or giving back loaned items. In 2011, Lohan was accused of stealing a necklace from a jewelry store in Venice, Calif., but the actress claimed she just borrowed it. Alas, her cries of innocence weren't convincing enough because a judge sentenced her to 120 days in jail and 480 hours of community service. Two years earlier, Lohan was involved in another missing jewelry incident when a necklace and earrings worth $400,000 went missing from an Elle magazine photo shoot featuring the ""Mean Girls"" actress.

""The dress has not been returned, and it wasn’t until we saw the photos in the media, that we became aware of the actual condition of the gown,"" a Theia spokesperson said.

As a proud sponsor of the AACTA Awards (the Aussie equivalent of the Oscars), I look forward to seeing how my favorite stars choose to present themselves when the world is watching. And the winners are....Best Style Chameleon: Jennifer Lawrence Since she turned heads in ravishing red Calvin Klein at the 2011 Oscars, Jennifer Lawrence has become one of the most hotly anticipated starlets to grace the red carpet. She nailed classic Hollywood glamour in Dior couture paired with a fab smoky eye at the Golden Globes, went for a modern take on Dior for the SAG Awards and then paired another sultry smoky eye with a barely-there lip at the BAFTA Awards for an edgy counterpoint to her sleek white gown. You can't deny Jennifer is gorgeous in the smoky eye she typically favors, but I adored her red lip look at the SAG Awards. Absolutely impeccable.Best and Fairest: Anne Hathaway She's gone from black to gold to white to blue to red in the dress department, and her hair has run the gamut from glamorous waves to an edgy pixie, but Anne Hathaway always embraces her flawless, alabaster skin. By avoiding the temptation to tan, Anne creates the perfect canvas for risk-taking fashion and bold makeup statements. Love! Fastest rise to fashion icon status: Jessica Chastain  Jessica has quickly become an actress to watch, both on the big screen and the red carpet. Her berry lip paired beautifully with a futuristic twist on screen siren waves and seafoam Calvin Klein at the Golden Globes. And at the SAGs, Jessica truly reigned in McQueen. Her naturally flattering makeup and gorgeous waves were the perfect complements to her dramatic style statements. For the BAFTA Awards she juxtaposed an avant garde silhouette with old Hollywood style hair and makeup for a look that was the epitome of modern glamour. She has absolutely nailed the red carpet. Best Use of Color in a Supporting Role: Naomi Watts At the Golden Globes, Watts' oxblood Zac Posen gown made her blue eyes pop without a strong makeup statement. At the SAG Awards, the off-white Marchesa gown ran the risk of washing out her fair features but a classic red lip make the look pop, while relaxed finger waves kept it modern. Naomi's a true pro and knows how to step up her style when she's in the spotlight as she is right now. Go Aussie, go!Independent Spirit Award: Lena Dunham Known for pushing the sartorial envelope (okay, more like every envelope) on the small screen, ""Girls"" creator Lena Dunham is still finding her footing on the red carpet, but she has the daredevil spirit required to pull off some seriously buzz-worthy looks. As her confidence grows I'd love to see her move beyond dark, borderline frumpy frocks and into more daring designs that reflect her youth and fun, irreverent attitude. Her standard smoky eye is becoming a signature look, but she shouldn't be afraid to play with color and mix it up a bit. You go girl!"

It may sometimes feel innate, but that's because people are often able to pick up on effective strategies implicitly, through experience and observation.",2013-02-20,portrait of young woman shouting with megaphone against a vintage wall,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd65c2200008300d965c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What makes a person good at -- and comfortable with -- persuading others? Yesterday, I had lunch with a friend, a brilliant and hardworking executive. I had just finished Dan Pink's excellent new book, To Sell Is Human, and was eager for my friend's take on it. In a nutshell, Pink argues that moving people (i.e., selling, but also persuading or influencing) has become an essential component of nearly everyone's job in the modern workplace. Everyone is in sales. Like a lot of people, I found Pink's argument to be radical, surprising, and undeniably true. But that doesn't necessarily mean everyone likes this argument. I thought my friend would find it interesting, but instead he seemed profoundly uncomfortable. ""That's crap,"" he said, more to himself than to me. ""I'm not a salesman. My job is strategy, not manipulating suckers.""On the surface, it seemed like the salesmen-are-slimy stereotype was at work here (something Pink's book tackles head-on and does an admirable job dispelling). There might also have been a touch of aversion to the idea of selling -- many of us wonder if it's right, ethically speaking, to persuade someone to buy or believe something. We're uneasy with the power that effective persuasion gives us. But, as Pink points out, it's impossible for human beings to avoid influencing, and being influenced by, other people's words and deeds. People are going to be moved -- the trick is to make sure that the ideas and products with genuine merit do the moving.In my friend's visible discomfort, however, I sensed something more. Something like what happens when you give an unsuspecting person a set of algebra problems and they literally back away from you, stuttering, ""Um... I'm not a math person."" (Believe it or not, in my job I actually do things like that.)I spend a lot of time writing and speaking about the pervasive -- and false -- belief that our success depends upon the possession of innate, immutable abilities. I drown my readers and listeners in data, showing beyond a reasonable doubt that reaching goals and mastering skills are about strategy, effort, and persistence, and that these things are learned. The abilities I have usually focused on are intelligence, creativity, self-control, and, of course, mathematical skill. But until I read Pink's latest book and witnessed my friend's reaction to the idea that the ability to move people is essential to success, it really hadn't occurred to me that a lot of people might think that's innate, too. Oh, no.To find out more, I turned to Google. I searched the Internet for the expression ""natural born salesman."" Over half a million hits. To be fair, many of these were attempts to dispel the myth of the naturally-gifted mover, but the need to dispel the myth speaks volumes about its ubiquity.Selling, moving, persuading, influencing... Many of us may resist the idea that this is part of our job description (or avoid taking positions for which it would be) because we believe we lack that ability, just as we avoided calculus in college like the plague because we weren't ""math people."" My friend doesn't want to believe that sales is a part of his job because he doesn't believe he is good at sales, and more importantly, because he doesn't believe he can be.(A quick aside: There is research suggesting that successful salespeople have particular personality traits, including conscientiousness, humility, and, as Pink points out, ""ambiversion"" -- being neither an extreme introvert nor extrovert. But it's important to not assume that personality traits = innate ability. Personalities can and do change as a result of our efforts and experiences. You aren't ""stuck"" as you are.)If you want to become good at influencing others, then you simply need to learn how. It's not magic, and it's certainly not innate. It may sometimes feel innate, but that's because people are often able to pick up on effective strategies implicitly -- without conscious awareness -- through experience and observation. Not realizing you are learning makes your abilities feel innate, even when they aren't. Do you want to be a people mover? Pick up one (or more) of the many excellent, data-driven books on the subject. To Sell Is Human is a good place to start. Robert Cialdini's Influence and Dan Ariely's Predictably Irrational are also filled with strategies of effective persuasion. (My forthcoming book with Tory Higgins, Focus, offers a few useful pointers as well.)Then, armed with the knowledge of what works, practice. Everything gets easier, more automatic, more ""natural"" with practice.

And thanks to the StarTribune, we were able get a glimpse into that of design guru Thom Filicia. In the short Q&A we learned that Filicia keeps some pretty unusual food in his house. When columnist C.J. asked what was in his refrigerator right now, Filicia answered “two bottles of champagne. About six types of different mustard. Saratoga water. Cranberry juice. A whole bunch of delicious stinky cheese and chocolate. There's always some kind of chocolate.”Six types of different mustard? Well, it’s clear to see what condiment is Filicia’s favorite and to be honest, it’s obvious in his designs. As one QVC reviewer pointed out, Filicia’s Full Bloom comforter set was supposed to be “inspired by the beauty of hydrangeas” but ended up being anything but delicate in color. ""I was disappointed when I received this as the yellow was not the yellow I was looking for - too mustard colored,” they wrote. And even in his collection for Kravet, there are quite a few hints of the dark yellow hue. An ironic coincidence? Maybe not.But we did learn something about Filicia that is definitely true. Filicia told the newspaper he’s still good friends with all the guys from “Queer Eye For The Straight Guy,” and they'll be celebrating the show's 10-year anniversary this summer. "" We're already discussing what we're going to do to celebrate. Yeah [there'll be a celebration on TV]. Pretty sure,” he told the newspaper.Well, we just can’t wait to see Filicia back on the boob tube and we’ll definitely have some champagne and mustard ready for the big occasion.Click through our slideshow to see photos of Filicia’s gorgeous home.

Comedians Mark Sarian and Ari Voukydis poke fun at the popular television show in their new YouTube video ""House Hunters: Park Slope"". In this episode, Voukydis and his wife Betsy Stover have a budget of $387,000 to find their house and realtor Sarian is on the hunt to help them. The threesome effortlessly act the part, mocking the couples on the show whose demands always seem to be a bit ridiculous. For instance, Sarian shows the couple a house that has a typical toilet with a hinged seat, and the two complain about having to lift it to go to the bathroom. “I just feel like you’ll get pee everywhere,” Voukydis says.

Facebook is proposing to end its practice of letting users vote on changes to its privacy policies, though it will continue to let users comment on proposed updates. The world's biggest social media company said in a blog post Wednesday, Nov. 21, 2012, that its voting mechanism, which is triggered only if enough people comment on proposed changes, has become a system that emphasizes quantity of responses over quality of discussion. Users tend to leave one or two-word comments objecting to changes instead of more in-depth responses. (AP Photo/dapd, Joerg Koch, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd56b2500003600363a59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Studies show that parental involvement is the number one factor in keeping kids safe online. As with any other activity, understanding what our kids do online means being involved and asking questions. Here are some tips about picking the time, place and tone for the conversation to get the results you want. You want information, but you need to avoid an interrogation. No one wants to feel like they did something wrong, and the ""third degree"" often results in a defensive, resentful silence. One approach to use is let your child be the teacher. Tell him or her you want to get better at social media and see what happens. As an added benefit, you might learn something about social media yourself. Whatever approach you use, here are five questions you can use to get the ball rolling.1. What is your favorite thing to do on Facebook? More kids are on Facebook than any social media site; nearly 90% of all teens have at least one social media account. It's pretty straightforward and open-ended question that will tell you what your kid thinks you want to know. It also sets the stage for the questions that follow.2. Do you have a lot of friends on Facebook? How many?  This question is a chance for your child to brag about their friends and opens the conversation to how they interact with these people and how they meet them. Feelings of envy or competition can lead many kids to adding people they don't know very well (or at all!) to bulk up their friends list.3. Are these mostly kids you met at school, sports or someplace else offline?  (add or substitute your child's group activities as appropriate) An important reminder is not to say ""in real life"" in comparison to online in the conversation, because online life is real to kids. There is no differentiation between the online and offline worlds. Having Facebook friends they don't know offline is not always a sign something is wrong. For example, Jane adds Jessica as a friend because Jane's friend Susan vouched for Jessica, sort of the way LinkedIn works with adults. However, it is something to watch out for. According to a report from Cincinnati's Children's Hospital in the journal Pediatrics, as many as 30 percent of girls have arranged an in-person meeting with someone they met on the Internet. Asking how your child adds Facebook friends helps you to understand the ratio of ""real"" friends in their Facebook community better. It will also trigger red flags if you find your child is often meeting people in person after they have met online.4. What is your favorite site after Facebook?  It's more than just Facebook out there! Parents need to broaden their understanding of their kids' online activities. Fifty percent of all teens are on Twitter and one in three teens uses Tumblr. Meanwhile, teen use of photo sharing sites like Instagram and Snapchat is on the rise. You want to find out what platforms and channels your kids are using to interact with other people -- and why. By understanding the platforms your children use, you will have a clearer idea of activities they are or might be engaged in. Do your own research on popular social platforms like Tumblr, Flickr, etc. If you use monitoring software, you can crosscheck what they say -- and I strongly recommend that you do.5. What do you do on this site? Why do you like it better than other sites?  There is a big difference between a kid spending a lot of time on YourCause.com and a kid who frequently uses Snapchat. These questions let parents understand what is important to their kids and what they are drawn to online.And remember to always ask: What do you do when someone you don't know approaches you online? This question gives kids the opportunity to show their maturity and gives parents the chance to gauge their kids' level of exposure online. While you're not always going to take their word on it, this question sets a good baseline for parents to understand how they need to approach further conversations and develop appropriate parenting strategies."
8,WELLNESS,Foods for the Soul,"Dr. Cynthia Thaik, Contributor
Cardiologist, Author, Founder Of Revitalize-U",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emotional-health_us_5b9cd23ce4b03a1dcc822125,"Nurture your soul with healthy foods that inspire you and build you up. Avoid those that create ugly feelings inside. By doing this, you will be able to keep your inner garden oasis beautiful and flourishing.",2013-02-19,Decline in hands. A sunset on a background of the lifted female hands,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd23c2000003100fdba7a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a cardiologist, I am constantly being asked for guidance on choosing healthy foods for the heart while avoiding unhealthy dietary habits. We pay close attention to the foods used to nourish and sustain our bodies. Equally important are the thoughts and feelings we use to nourish and energize our mind, spirit and soul. Just as we recognize that choosing fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts is preferable to choosing hamburgers, fried foods, and donuts, if we want a healthy heart, we need to recognize healthy and unhealthy foods for the soul's nourishment.I like to visualize the soul this way. Picture a beautiful garden oasis, a tranquil, silvery-blue pool surrounded by lush greenery and vivid flowers, a calming, spicy scent and whispers of birdsong in the air. A place where you can sit in the quiet tranquility and feel better, no matter what might be going on in your life. That is the ideal peaceful soul within. It is a beautiful place where soul and spirit can go to find renewal and rejuvenation. The garden is securely protected by a portal or gateway created by the mind. The strength of that gateway keeps peace and tranquility safe within, protected from harmful breaches that could disturb or destroy it. Maintaining the health of our gateway and the soul beyond requires careful nurturing. If we do not strengthen and protect the gateway, and instead inject unhealthy foods into our soul, it can no longer serve as a peaceful refuge within us. We become susceptible to the turmoil of anger, unhappiness, stress, and dissatisfaction with our lives.How, then, do we strengthen the mind's portal and keep our soul healthy and nurtured? Let's explore some of the healthy and unhealthy foods for the soul.Healthy Foods for the Soul:While these foods nourish and replenish the soul, offering peace and strength, there are unhealthy foods that diminish and damage the soul, wearing down the protective mind portal and leaving your soul agitated and in distress. These foods are powerful, and you must take care to safeguard against them.Unhealthy Foods that Diminish and Damage the Soul:1. Self-doubt is the inner voice that says, ""I can't; I'm not good enough, smart enough, or pretty enough. I don't know how!"" Self-doubt is insidious in its nature. It destroys hope, imagination, and dreams. Feelings of inadequacy have often been instilled into the very fabric of our being long before we began to develop strong, cohesive thoughts of our own. Nourish yourself against self-doubt by acting without worrying about the whys or the hows. Trust in the absence of evidence and stay present without allowing the past to taint or infect the moment. Talk back to the negative inner voice and counter it with proof -- you are good enough!2. Judgement: Carl Jung said, ""Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves."" We may judge others, but we often turn a more harsh judgement on ourselves. Constant judgement and criticism will wear your soul down. Accept that you are human. We all make mistakes. Be compassionate and forgiving toward yourself and learn to move on. You cannot change the past.3. Stress. This can be a difficult one, because stress is so often outside of your control. You may not always be able to control stress itself, but you can choose how you deal with it. Stress tears away bits of your soul. It causes the release of cortisol, which provides short-term, immediate energy to cope with the situation, but compromises your immune system in the long term. When you are under stress, pay particular attention to the need to nourish your soul with good foods. Try to look beyond the situation. You may be beaten down, but you are never defeated unless you give up. Do not feed stress. Take a deep breath. Feed a calm spirit of acceptance.4. Fear and insecurity. We live in a fearful world. People feel the need to protect themselves and often let fear eclipse common sense. Fear is an irrational part of a negative belief system, an expectation that the worst will happen. Focus on things that build confidence and security, rather than those that make you fearful. Fill your life and mind with hopeful thoughts. In every negative event, something can be found that offers hope. Challenge your fears and insecurities. Find something that makes you feel strong and make it your touchstone.5. Anger and hatred. Anger builds up and fuels hatred. The Buddha said, ""Holding onto anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else -- you are the one who gets burned."" Anger will consume your soul and destroy any nourishment you have provided. It increases anxiety, raises blood pressure, causes headaches, and can impede healthy circulation. It can cause the release of stomach acid and can affect breathing. Anger can kill you. When angry and hateful feelings start to fill you up, breathe slowly and focus. Access your quiet, peaceful inner soul and push the anger back. Ask yourself why you are feeling anger. Will this still matter tomorrow, next week, next year? Practice compassion and forgiveness. Nurture your soul with healthy foods that inspire you and build you up. Avoid those that create ugly feelings inside. By doing this, you will be able to keep your inner garden oasis beautiful and flourishing.
