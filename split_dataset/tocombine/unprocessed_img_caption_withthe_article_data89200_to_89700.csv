Things are getting foggy and slightly out of focus these days and it's not always caused by the couple of drinks we have with dinner.We started this discussion a few days earlier by lamenting on how much we missedplaying the competitive sports of our younger days.You can click on the highlighted links to go back and read them.These were important things... essential parts of my life!I really miss these things now that I am older.Now that summer is quickly approaching, I am reminded of one more thing that I really miss from my youth.The warmer weather brings with it bar-b-cues, picnics, baseball games and family get-togethers. These bring out the foods I can no longer eat that I loved when I was younger.You know what I am talking about right?I'm talking about your favorite foods that you devoured when you were younger that cause all kinds of gastrointestinal issues if you eat them today.Everybody has them and they vary from processed foods, dairy, spicy foods to fruits and vegetables.I know I am getting old and I can accept that. But not being able to eat the foods I have always loved is a different issue.Like a large percentage of the Baby Boomer population I have minor issues digesting dairy products.My girlfriend, Doc, thinks I might be slightly lactose intolerant, which means (unfortunately for her) a little more gas and a few more farts escaping from me.I live in the desert Southwest, the home of spicy Mexican foods filled with beans, chilies, cheeses and peppers. I know I can't eat spicy foods like I used to anymore.Let's say I have modified my eating habits to match what Miller Brewing has done to their beers. My menus are now ""spicy light.""I'm OK with that, but there are a few foods that really cause me angst and I really struggle with having to remove them from my diet.The first of these came as a real surprise to me.I struggle after eating cucumbers. Cucumbers are a vegetable for Pete's sake. They are supposed to be good for you but after eating them I get gas and burp them back up for hours.My research leads me to believe that I am not alone here. It appears that cucumbers contain a chemical compound called cucurbitacin. Most of this compound is found in the seeds and skins and this causes a phenomena technically referred to as ""cucumber burp"" in some people.I love cucumbers... but they don't love me anymore.Let's toss in onions while we're at it to the list of vegetables that I can't eat anymore. Am I the only Baby Boomer that suffers from ""onion intolerance symptoms?""  When I was younger, onions were a staple of my diet. Of course, they were always piled high on my hot dogs and hamburgers but they were also a vital ingredient in everything I ate including salads, salsa, meatloaf, spaghetti, soups, stews and slaws.Who can eat fried bologna without onions?Don't forget late night snacking on ""Funyuns.""My ""intolerance"" for onions may stem from the high amount of sulfur that is found in this vegetable as well as other vegetables like beans, garlic, chives, and kale. It appears that as we get older we lose essential enzymes in our systems needed to digest certain chemicals and food compounds.  The University of Maryland Medical Center says that ""raw garlic and onions also contain lots of fiber that can cause gas and indigestion.""This may be the reason why I have such a hard time after eating a bowl of chili. I loved chili when I was younger. There was nothing better than a hot bowl of chili with a handful of oyster crackers for lunch on a cold winter day in Chicago. But chili is full of onions and garlic and beans.All are considered healthy foods but as I have gotten older, they sure do keep me up at night.I'm sure you are thinking about a few of your favorite foods right now that you loved as a youngster but can't handle as a maturing adult.How about liver sausage?Maybe bacon is your gastronomical nemesis?I once ate fish sticks with abandon when I was younger (just ask my kids about them when I was a poor single Dad) but now they leave me gobbling Tums by the handful.Finally, let's finish with the granddaddy of them all: Hot Dogs.The Baby Boomer generation grew up eating hot dogs. Hot Dogs are by definition an almost perfect food. They are an easy, convenient and inexpensive meal that combines meat (I think) bread and vegetables all in one bite.What could be better?And they are found virtually everywhere on the planet... cookouts, restaurants, roadside stands, ballparks, picnics and even in front of Home Depots and Lowe's.In my youth, I would eat hot dogs every day if I could get away with it.What's really In a Hot Dog?An article I read estimates that almost 65% of the U.S. population eats hot dogs on a regular basis and that the average person eats over 30 pounds of hot dogs/sausages a year!But then there are disturbing articles like the one written by the PCRM Nutrition Education Director Susan Levin that states:   ""A hot dog a day could send you to an early grave.""Ouch!!!All I know is that when I eat a couple of hot dogs for lunch or at a ballgame I feel the effects for hours. Acid re-flux, indigestion, irritable bowel syndrome, painful rectal itch...take your pick. These are all bad side effects I experience now when eating my favorite food.The controversy over how deadly hot dogs really are rages on. Nobody is really sure what type of meat is in hot dogs. Hot dogs contain high quantities of nitrites and preservatives.Experts say that the ""nitrites combine with amines naturally present in the meat to form carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds"" when these puppies are cooked. These compounds have been associated with cancer of the mouth, urinary tract, esophagus, stomach and brain.But boy are they ever tasty!!!Let's not get too deep into the amounts of fat, salt and cholesterol that can be found in hot dogs as well.My motto has always been: ""If it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger."" Not so much anymore with hot dogs.So, are there any other foods that you loved when you were younger that just don't sit right with you anymore?Please make sure to share them with other Baby Boomers in the comment section below."
1,POLITICS,Your Employer's Wellness Program Can Demand Your DNA,"Al Lewis, ContributorCEO, www.quizzify.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/should-your-employers-wellness-program-can-demand-your-dna_b_7249684.html,"Imagine if, as part of your workplace wellness program, your human resources department and your health insurance company could make you fork over some DNA.",2015-05-14,"A man does workout with a handle bar at the FIBO international trade show for fitness, wellness and health in Cologne, western Germany, on 10 April, 2015. The show opened on April 9 and will run until April 12, 2015. AFP PHOTO / PATRIK STOLLARZ (Photo credit should read PATRIK STOLLARZ/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6917cb2300007c1839f7bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Imagine if, as part of your workplace wellness program, your human resources department and your health insurance company could make you fork over some DNA. Besides using this DNA to predict your odds (with very limited accuracy) of getting diabetes or a heart attack in 20 years, imagine that your employer's insurance company has partnered with a foreign company that will store, use, and profit from information your DNA reveals.Imagine no longer. This could be coming soon to your company, if you are one of the 23-million people insured by Aetna. Plus, if Aetna can make enough money selling its program to enough employers, other insurers might start demanding and re-selling employee DNA too.The good is news is that your participation must be ""voluntary."" The bad news is thanks to the Business Roundtable's influence on Congress and pressure they placed on the White House, the current definition of ""voluntary"" -- a definition likely to be confirmed under proposed rules --  sounds a lot like the definition of ""involuntary."" Specifically, you can now be forced to ""voluntarily"" forfeit up to about $2000/year (through fines or lost incentives amounting to 30% of the total cost of your health insurance) for refusing to allow your employer to experiment with these programs on you. ""Experimenting with these programs"" on you may seem like hyperbole, but that's the phrase used by Katherine Baicker, the Harvard professor whose precise but ill-considered claims of savings helped enshrine wellness in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). (By contrast, now that forced wellness is already etched into law, she admits: ""There are very few studies [with] reliable data."")While Aetna itself is not storing your DNA, the Aetna partner company actually collecting this information, a Canadian firm called Newtopia, says that your DNA will be safe with them in Ontario. ""Safe"" may be defined as ""unsafe,"" though, because Newtopia's privacy policy, linked in their footer menu, is rather vague, listing only ""some of"" the ways they can re-use this data. Buried in the lengthy list is: ""Research: we can collect, use and disclose your de-identified personal information to perform research into weight and lifestyle management."" One could assume that, as a private company, they intend to profit from selling or publishing this information and research. Newtopia's website doesn't disclose the possibility that your DNA might be mishandled by one of the eight specified groups of people (including ""naturopathic doctors"") or the unspecified ""other persons"" who can use your data ""to take care of you."" Yet despite admitting no possibility of errors, Newtopia's privacy policy does say they can use your DNA for ""error management."" Leaving aside the unfairness of employers now being allowed to threaten you with fines to give up your DNA to someone to profit from it and manage errors with it, national privacy expert Anna Slomovic says ""de-identified"" DNA can and has been re-identified. Her blog on this topic recommends against letting a company ""store"" your DNA -- especially a company whose privacy policy doesn't list all the ways they can use your data or all the people who can access it.This doesn't even begin to mention the possibility of wholesale data breaches. Sixty million Anthem policyholders were breached, a large wellness company called Staywell had a breach, and there have been 2.3 million reported instances of medical identify theft.As if this all weren't concerning enough, Aetna's and Newtopia's other forays into wellness don't exactly inspire confidence.In a collaboration with a couple of small drug companies, Aetna recently tried to convince companies to let its representatives pitch those companies' drugs directly to their obese employees. These weren't just any old drugs, but rather drugs whose claims to fame were their poor marketplace acceptance (""nothing short of a nightmare""), high promotional fees paid to physicians, and hazardous side effects, none of which Aetna's sales material disclosed.Newtopia's website proclaims ""SCIENCE DRIVES EVERYTHING WE DO."" Yet it features a ""scientific"" statement that any fifth-grader can see is made up: ""Companies that promote health are three times more productive than those that don't."" So if Walmart used Newtopia's genetic testing, would their cashiers ring up three times more customers? Could doctors see three times more patients? Could pilots fly planes three times faster? Would customer service ""hold"" messages tell us our calls are three times more important to them? Unlikely. And if we can't trust Newtopia to interpret fifth-grade science, why should we trust them to interpret our DNA?You shouldn't, according to Mayo Clinic endocrinologist Dr. Michael Jenson. He told the Associated Press that genetic testing can predict only about 5% of risk, which may be why Aetna doesn't cover routine genetic screening if done by your doctor without allowing Newtopia near your DNA. Besides, what good is knowing the answer? If you have a ""positive"" genetic test, you might be advised to lose weight and exercise, whereas absent the test, your best advice is to lose weight and exercise. While that might seem like sound healthcare advice,""advice"" joins ""voluntary"" and ""safe"" on the list of words that the dystopian world of wellness defines the opposite of what we'd assume. Newtopia itself insists that healthcare advice ""does not constitute...healthcare advice."" Oh, yes, and ""taking care of you"" does not mean taking care of you.If all this sounds like a bunch of Orwellian doublespeak to justify a shocking degree of intrusion into employees' lives with no benefit, that's because it is. Even Aetna arguably thinks so. They collaborated on a report, co-authored with 27 other companies with a stake in the highly profitable workplace wellness industry, conceding wellness to be a money-losing idea even for employers who don't spend an extra $500 to analyze employee DNA. Absent any economic value of wellness itself, the point of the heavy-handed politics of ""voluntary"" wellness may be to allow employers to levy fines against non-compliant employees. One vendor even brags about doing this, and the Business Roundtable has consistently lobbied for more ability to do fine employees, or as they say, ""empower"" them. Once again, there is a definitional disconnect: The Business Roundtable functionally if not literally defines ""empower"" as ""reduce mandatory minimum employer insurance contributions and instead require employees to submit to programs like this one to have any hope of enjoying a decent insurance benefit.""Maybe despite all this, Aetna could at least say its program works. No such luck. Alas, even the customer Aetna gave to the Associated Press to profile, Jackson Laboratory, isn't exactly thrilled with the program. Among other things, most of the employees they invited into the program declined. Another third initially participated but dropped out. Curiously, Newtopia's website nonetheless claims that 92 percent of Jackson's participants succeeded. Perhaps their fifth-grade science teacher also taught math.Jackson's spokesperson also voiced concern about Aetna's $500/employee price tag. He told the Associated Press Jackson might drop the program after another year.Sure that's the experience of just one company, and what do they know about the benefits of genetic testing? Plenty, as it turns out -- Jackson's website says it is a ""leading genetic research laboratory."" If a genetics organization passes on a program featuring genetics, perhaps the rest of us should pass too.Finally, let's end on some good news. The law only allows your employers to conduct ""voluntary"" genetic analyses only if these exams and experiments have ""business necessity."" The latter language may offer a way to recoup these $2000 fines, not just for DNA-based programs but for perhaps any wellness programs, by arguing this point to the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. Since these programs show no demonstrable effect on health (the answer is always to eat better and exercise more regardless of your genes), it is hard to imagine any ""business necessity"" in your employer deciding to ""experiment on"" you. Employers don't just lose money, according to the publication that Aetna collaborated on. These programs also damage morale, and harm corporate reputations. Those two additional drawbacks are also listed in that very same publication. In other words, that's what Aetna itself says.What the rest of us would say can't be printed in a family publication like Huffington Post.Note: Both Newtopia and Aetna were offered the opportunity to review/comment on/rebut/correct earlier drafts of this article. Aside from a mysterious call from an Aetna functionary demanding my mailing address, no response was offered."

It will highlight real life insight on how women have been able to turn weakness into strength. Each interview is the naked truth about breakdowns that inspired breakthroughs. These women have experienced internal changes, which make them quintessential Paradigm Shifters.Everything I have ever done has been focused on this underlying theme of shifting the paradigm because ""what we think determines what we feel and what we feel determines what we do."" Hence why Seven Bar Foundation and Empowered By You takes lingerie, which has traditionally been seen merely as a tool of seduction, and makes it a tool of empowerment.I hope after reading these stories you will look at your own situations, struggles and accomplishments through a different lens and, at the very least, be better equipped to change your own paradigm. At the end of the day, we are our own Alchemists turning the silver we were born with into the gold we are destined to become.  Esther HavensBECKY STRAW -- Co-Founder & CEO of the Adventure Project What you do requires drive and determination; what gave you the courage to jump in headfirst? I was doing development work internationally for years, focused on bringing people clean drinking water. Yet, if you look closely at the water crisis, 36 percent of all wells in Africa are broken. So, one third of all people living in Africa that had water at one point and now don't because there's no spare parts, tools, or well mechanics. While I was in villages trying to figure out how to keep wells working, everyone would come up to me and ask me if I was hiring. I realized the irony that people are desperate to work and we have nobody who has the skills to fix wells. So that's how it started.If you had to give me one line that explained what makes you different what would it be?We're The Adventure Project because we ""add venture"" to create jobs in developing countries. While aid is always appreciated, a job has the power to move a family out of poverty. One of the areas we focus on is training people to be well mechanics. They learn the skill of keeping the well working and maintained, and the community pays user fees to make sure there's a business model in place so it's sustained.What does being a winner of the DVF Award mean to you?Tammy Tibbetts from She's the First nominated us. I think I'm still in shock, but it means a great deal. It was a huge surprise to us. It was incredible to just be nominated, honestly. The other people who'd been nominated previously are people I admire -- the cache attached to them, the things that they've done and accomplished, and the impact they're making. To have my name attached to that is mind-boggling.What was a shift in your life that changed your perspective?It really happened in Haiti. After the earthquake I'd gone with Jody, who is my co-founder, and a friend who's a photographer and storyteller; we were three women in one of the largest tent camps outside Port-au-Prince. After the earthquake, there's nothing you can see but white gravel and white tents and the very small skyline of mountains. And these three men walked up to us, and they were so intimidating and huge. They walked straight to us and we had no aid to offer. So many nonprofits flooded into Haiti with aid, and we had nothing, so I was nervous they were going to be upset. Instead, they walked up to us and one man just said, ""Excuse me ma'am. I'm wondering if you're hiring, because we really want to work?"" It was such a moment of clarity, because this is what people want most in the world.  What about a breakdown that turned out to be breakthrough?Starting this, we didn't take salaries for a year and half, which meant that eventually credit cards do max out. So after my second credit card maxed out, I put all my stuff in storage and moved onto friends' couches and spent about nine months in NYC bouncing from friends' couches with one suitcase and just living off the generosity of strangers. It was the scariest moment, because I was wondering, ""Is this really going to work?"" And it was the most empowering moment because people were so kind. I would sometimes have three people calling saying, ""My place is open, come stay"". It was so generous and thoughtful of them.What advice would you give your younger self?Be kind to yourself. As women, we put so much pressure on ourselves to be everything and then we look in the mirror and say, oh I'm horrible. Oh I didn't do X, Y, and Z. You always feel like a failure and you always have people telling you you're not going to succeed, so you need to recognize that you can do it. What legacy do you wish to leave behind?I just want to do a good job now. Do a good job today. I want to leave the world better than when I left it. Sometimes people say to me, ""Wow, I could never do that"" and I just want to say you can. You also don't need to follow my footsteps and start your own thing. Just giving to support to one person and help them get a job, you will transform their life, and it ripples to help the whole community. It's possible to end extreme poverty in our lifetimes if we all just give a little bit. When you're having a hard day, how do you turn it around?Drink. Just kidding! Just try and laugh. Or, I step away from my computer and get a coffee or a frozen yogurt. Just the little things that bring you back and keep you going.Becky is not only is this year's DVF Award winner, but she is also an example of what could be possible when you live outside of fear and stay true to your calling. She is achieving transformative impact and the world is a better place because of her. "
3,ARTS,Pornosophy: Loving Sex?,"Francis Levy, ContributorWriter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pornosophy-loving-sex_b_7273606.html,Is loving sex all that it's cracked up to be? Or is it the province of bad movies like Love Story (1970) or another sixties classic A Man and a Woman (1966).

Or is it the province of bad movies like Love Story (1970) or another sixties classic A Man and a Woman (1966). One of the nice things about a film like Richard Linklater's Before Midnight (2013) is that it shies away from loving sex. One of the film's great scenes is an enormous argument that breaks out in an elegant hotel room which a couple has been treated to as a gift. Instead of passionate lovemaking the time away from the kids turns into a massive back and forth in which mutual recriminations almost end in a breakup. Another classic depiction of non-loving sex occurs in Antonioni's L'avventura (1960) when Claudia (Monica Vitti) discovers Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti) in the arms of the American whore Gloria Perkins (Dorothy De Polioli). It's a scene of almost orgasmic disenchantment in which everything that is wrong with the universe is concentrated in one spectacularly revolting embrace. David Lean's version of Noel Cowards's Brief Encounter had love, but the encounter was too brief to turn into sex. And then there is the case of the second to the last film John Holmes ever made, The Rise of the Roman Empress (1987). At this point in his career, Holmes already knew he was HIV positive yet he proceeded to have unprotected sex with the Italian porn star and politician La Cicciolina. If there were an award given for malevolently intentioned unloving sex or ""loving porking,"" this film could very well get it. These days loving sex is literally the talk of the town. It's the only way for students to indulge their promiscuous desires in California under the new ""Affirmative Consent"" statute which is one of the biggest challenges to the pleasures of the hate fuck. Last Tango in Paris (1972) contained some sex scenes which epitomized the misery of the human condition and are the perfect antidote to the virus of sentimentalism which is on the verge of infecting both cinema and life. The monologue of the nurse, Alma (Bibi Andersson), in Bergman's Persona (1966) is also an effective remedy for romantic daydreams, along with the old locker room adage, ""tell 'em you love 'em and you lay 'em.""{This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"

This time, it was from Ben Carson, who's running for (and has no chance of becoming) President. He hinted to CNBC that ""other groups"" would deserve marriage if gay couples gained the freedom to marry.When pressed on what those other groups were, he eventually admitted that they might include bigamists.This is a suggestion that comes up a lot, even from the Supreme Court. Last mont, Justice Alito observed, ""a group consisting of two men and two women apply for a marriage license. Would there be any ground for denying them a license?""Yes, there would, although the reason might not be immediately obvious.Here's why: From a legal perspective, marriage is a contract, and gender doesn't change what the contract does. In states that have legalized marriage for gays and lesbians, the only change in those contracts was the genders. A few pronouns were switched, but when gay couples marry, everything else still works exactly the same way. But for marriage contracts to cover multiple partners, a lot more would have to change. If there's a divorce, who gets custody of whose child? Who gets to make medical decisions for who? Are there limits on employer benefits for spouses? Can everyone immigrate together? If someone dies without a will, who's next of kin?For marriage to start covering multiple partners, you can't just switch some pronouns. The whole contract would have to be re-written from the ground up. So that's why marriage for gays doesn't lead to polygamy. It also doesn't lead to marrying children, or animals, or inanimate objects. Remember, marriage is a contract. And if one of the parties doesn't agree to it, or isn't capable of agreeing, well then it's not an agreement. It's not a marriage.But I that Ben knows that. And that he, a neurosurgeon, is capable of telling the difference between two men who want to commit to spending the rest of their lives together and, say, two dogs who look cute in costumes.So I'm not even sure what Ben Carson's trying to say at this point. Is he seriously running for president, or just getting gullible donors to pay for him to audition for Fox News?"

President of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf with IREX Chief of Party Bill Burke at the first national conference on ‪EbolaAfter a period of intense national suffering, Liberia has just been declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization. In addition to thanking the dedicated health care workers in her country, President Sirleaf acknowledged the key role civil society played in helping to turn the tide.  Civil society, including registered nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), informal networks of citizens and faith-based institutions, has unique strengths in mitigating crises that can complement -- and sometimes compensate for -- formal government systems. A recent event hosted by IREX explored these very issues and the assets civil society can bring when disasters arise.  Established Networks: Reaching people can be a challenge in any crisis. Carl Gershman, President of the National Endowment for Democracy, spoke about how civil society has ""the ability to reach citizens at the community level."" One example he gave was of a national youth organization in Afghanistan that is known for its blood drives whenever there's an attack by the Taliban.  Flexibility: Crises are dynamic and local organizations have the ability to adjust in real time under changing circumstances. Bill Burke, IREX Chief of Party in Liberia, talked about how local partner NAYMOTE adapted their Vote Smart Van project, originally an election activity, to reach and support communities struggling with Ebola. Gershman also noted how local civic groups responded to the devastating floods in Bosnia Herzegovina and Serbia last year, organizing across ethnic lines in order to raise funds and provide services.  Rapid Response: Along with their networks and flexibility, civil society organizations' presence in the heart of affected areas means that they can sometimes mobilize more quickly than larger, bureaucratic entities. ""Local groups started to respond to Ebola before any international organizations came to their aid,"" stressed Burke.Critical Information: There are 1.1 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine, noted IREX Country Director Megan Volk. IDPs and those in conflict zones need information on where fighting is happening, road closures, the complicated process for exit permits and the whereabouts of family members. ""NGOs and libraries can help connect people with this information,"" said Volk. Ukrainian NGO Donbass-SOS, for example, is sending out such updates on Twitter and has a hotline.Credibility: Community leaders and local institutions can play a crucial role in delivering and reinforcing messages, such as health-related information during the Ebola crisis. And when there is distrust of governments, civil society can help citizens critically analyze the news and information that they're presented with, noted Volk. ""The pastors, the imams, the youth leaders, the mothers, and grandmothers are the trusted voices in communities,"" said Burke.  But civil society organizations themselves aren't trusted everywhere. ""There are some countries that, as we know, don't like civil society very much. And they suffer in crises,"" said Gershman, giving China's repression of civil society during the Sichuan earthquake in 2008 as an example.  So what's the key to more effectively responding to crises? Giving local civil society organizations leadership in these situations.""Civil society needs more resources, not just a bunch of technical advisors. Give them more financial resources to manage their organizations,"" said Gershman.Jennifer Bielman from Mercy Corps emphasized that working hand-in-hand with community-based organizations also builds long-term resilience, moving societies ""from coping and adaptation to creating transformative change.""  The strength of the civil society sector varies widely from country to country, and even within countries. But investing in the capacity of these institutions and their networks is part of a long-range strategy that can help societies respond more effectively when short-term crises happen."
8,SPORTS,This is the Tiger That Earl Woods Raised,"Steve Siebold, ContributorAuthor and expert in the field of critical thinking and mental...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-is-the-tiger-that-ea_b_7275154.html,"Earl Woods said he made it clear his purpose was ""not to raise a golfer. I wanted to raise a good person."" Despite the bad reputation that follows Tiger these days, here's proof that there's still a good person living inside of him.",2015-05-14,"Tiger Woods hits from the 16 tee during the final round of The Players Championship golf tournament Sunday, May 10, 2015, in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77d822100002501c8fb4d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tiger Woods is a name that resonates with a lot of people for a variety of reasons. Most people automatically think of all the great golf accomplishments and records he has broken. Others think of his relationship troubles and his inability to remain faithful to a single woman. But something that is really worthy of attention when it comes to Tiger Woods is how he helped a young boy who was recently being bullied. When Tiger Woods heard about a 12-year-old boy named Dillon who was being picked on at school because he stutters, Woods sent the boy a letter encouraging him to stay strong and telling him he knows what it's like to be different. Tiger reveals that he too stuttered as a child. This is the Tiger that Earl Woods raised. The late Earl Woods, Tiger's father, is looking down on his son and smiling today. Earl Woods perhaps drew as much notoriety as Tiger himself. Earl was known in the golfing community and amongst the public for his tough but fair parenting style. Tiger Woods is one of the most mentally tough golfers, if not athletes, of all time, and it was Earl Woods who made him so mentally tough. When Earl Woods passed away in 2006, Tiger said of his dad, ""My dad was my best friend and greatest role model, and I will miss him deeply. I'm overwhelmed when I think of all the things he accomplished in his life. He was an amazing dad, coach, mentor, soldier, husband and friend. I wouldn't be where I am today without him, and I'm honored to continue his legacy of sharing and caring.""Yes, of course, it's easy to make the argument that Tiger hasn't always been the best role model based on his personal life, but deep down, the boy that Earl Woods raised will always live inside of Tiger Woods. When you put the fame aside, the golf clubs away and forget about his personal indiscretions, Tiger Woods will always possess the world-class values that were drilled into him by Earl Woods. Reaching out to this young boy being bullied is the perfect example. It's something that Tiger wasn't forced to do. It's something he chose to do. Earl Woods taught Tiger about personal integrity, focus, commitment and being a good person. Earl was known for praising Tiger for his efforts, not his accomplishments. He was known for making Tiger always fight, never giving up no matter what the circumstances. It's part of the reason I believe Tiger made 142 consecutive cuts, a feat I don't think anyone else will accomplish for a long time if ever again. We all make mistakes and use bad judgement from time to time, and Tiger Woods is certainly no exception. But the truth remains Earl Woods did an incredible job raising Tiger. He started his son in golf at a very early age, and coached him exclusively for his first years in the sport. The dedication this man showed for his child is a model for all moms and dads raising children today. Earl Woods said he made it clear his purpose was ""not to raise a golfer. I wanted to raise a good person."" Despite the bad reputation that follows Tiger these days, here's proof that there's still a good person living inside of him. Through stories like this one, those values that Earl Woods instilled in Tiger continue to live on. Earl Woods wasn't just a role model for Tiger. He was a role model for all of us."

When you start kindergarten at 5, you should be able to spell your name. You become a teenager at 13 and should start rebelling against your parents. You can drive at 16 and should start thinking about what you want to do when you grow up. You're eligible to vote at 18 and should be going off to college. You're allowed to drink at 21 and should be learning how to live on your own. But what happens after 21? Maybe all these guidelines are for grown-ups to try and teach responsibility to children, but I never understood these rules. I was always excited to wake up on my birthday, but was ultimately disappointed when 18 didn't feel that much different from being 17 the day before. So, what does it actually mean to be a grown-up, and when did I pass that threshold into adulthood? Was the tipping point when I moved to New York City on my own, proud to be sleeping in my first shoebox apartment, basking in the glory of all the IKEA furniture I could afford? Or was it when I received my first paycheck, contributed to my 401(k), or filed my own taxes -- proudly clicking that no one could claim me as a dependent? Somehow I'm doing all the ""responsible"" things that seem to point to adulthood, yet when I look at my parents, I sense an ocean of difference between them, being true adults, and me, who is just going through the motions and being a ""wannabe adult.""Ultimately, I think being an adult isn't any one age or any one thing. It doesn't mean that you don't lean on other people when you fall. It just means that you count on yourself first and foremost and don't expect anyone else to clean up your mess for you. It hit me (literally) when I got into my first car accident. I sideswiped a cab accidentally during the first time I rented a car for a business trip. Always having been the kind of girl who followed the rules, I panicked and quickly scanned my phone for who to call. Do I call my parents or my company's HR department? Finally, it dawned on me that it was up to me to fix this. I calmly got out of the vehicle and checked to see if the taxi driver was OK before going to the nearest Dunkin' Donuts and buying everyone coffee while we waited to exchange paperwork and for the police to come. It might seem obvious that that's what you're supposed to do, but it was the first time I clearly fought against my instinct to call my parents for help.There is a saying in Mandarin that loosely goes, ""Old, young. Old, young."" It means that the old become like the young again when they need others' help to take care of themselves -- which my parents are now doing for my grandparents. Or perhaps its significance runs deeper. The first time I came home crying after breaking up with my first love was a learning moment of stepping into adulthood. The look on my mom's tearful face as she hugged me broke my heart. She was in pain simply because I was hurt, and she and I both knew there was nothing she could do to make it better or protect me from future pain like this. After that day, I vowed never to cry in front of my parents again; I wanted to save them from whatever hurt I could and limit the amount of worry they endured for me.Neither of these were life-changing moments. I'll get into car trouble in the future and I've had my heartbroken since then. But to me, they symbolize the baby steps I took in becoming an adult, because there isn't a magical age or threshold beyond which adulthood lies. I believe no one really knows what the heck he or she is doing. Adults aren't minted at 25 years old. It's because small steps like these that we'll wake up one day and realize that we might be adults now. Watch out world, I'm taking off the training wheels."

My father used to say this to me when I was younger -- a lot. Whenever I had to make a decision I would say ""on one hand this and that are important and on the other hand I really need to be mindful of these things. Then, on the other hand what if this person is hurt by my actions and it's not the right decision."" And so on and so on. He would then reply: ""get out of the huddle and you only have two hands.""Most of the time when we need to make a decision we are so concerned about the outcome of the decision or failing that we deliberate until we are blue in the face or we run out of hands. We reach out to our friends or trusted colleagues to get their opinions, thereby adding more ""hands"" and rendering ourselves more confused than ever. We ask others for their opinions because it feels better on the surface, as we feel we are not making the decision alone and someone can theoretically ""share"" the blame if something were to go awry. What happens most of the time though, if you really check in, is that you hear their opinion and your logical mind may agree with it as it makes sense, but your gut and intuition still feel that it may not be the right choice. What is it about making a decision that seems so daunting and challenging for most people? Our challenge is we take a decision and lace it with fear and insecurity. Once we entwine the decision with fear and insecurity, it not only clouds the decision that needs to be made, but it actually morphs the issue at hand to something else entirely.People who have The OM Factor® do not let the size, shape and complexity of the decision affect their analysis. They view all decisions as a series of choices, and analyze the facts while leaving emotion out of it. Some decisions may be made faster than others, but they are all processed without attachment. It's not that these individuals are immune to emotions. They know that they must do what is best for all parties involved and not just what is best for them in that particular moment. When you feel indecisive, try this breath counting technique. It is used to improve focus and concentration, enabling you to make clear and confident decisions. The fantastic thing is that this ancient Zen exercise can be done anywhere and takes no more than five-minutes:Breath Counting: • Sit comfortably on a chair. Rest your hands on your thighs with your palms facing up. Place your feet apart flat on the floor and close your eyes.• Take a few moments to feel the earth and observe your breath.• Next, breathe in slowly through your nostrils and silently count each full breath. After the first inhalation and exhalation say, ""one,"" either silently or aloud. That is one full breath. After the second inhalation and exhalation say, ""two."" That is a second full breath, and so on.• Repeat this sequence until you reach five full breaths. After reaching five, start again from one. • You may notice you count beyond five breaths. That is an indication that your mind has drifted from the practice of this exercise. Bring it back to one. If you get distracted don't worry. Let it go. Simply go back to one and start again. This will train the mind in a very short period of time. • Repeat this exercise for a few rounds, or as long as your time allows you to sit there. Even two-to-three rounds will make a profound difference.• Slowly open your eyes and remain seated for a few more moments before getting back to your tasks.When you are unattached to the outcome of the decision, you make decisions that create space for the best possible outcome for you. However, when you are attached to the outcome, fear and indecisiveness come and take the space and then the outcome is much less ideal and a very stressful experience. So always remember to get out of the huddle and you only have two hands.More exercises can be found in my new book, THE OM FACTOR: A Woman's Spiritual Guide to Leadership - 7 Essential Tools and 7 Key Traits to Cultivate for Your Success and Well-Being.For more inspiration, connect with Alka Dhillon on Twitter; Facebook; Instagram; Blog; Website; and Linkedin."

On view now until June 12, the 36-piece exhibition encourages visitors to listen to Drake's song selections at listening stations through Beats By Dr. Dre Pro Headphones. The show brings together over 70 years of influential Contemporary black American artists, including Kara Walker, Betye Saar and Jean-Michel Basquiat. As one of the first mainstream exhibitions to incorporate of-the-moment hip hop music, the show serves as a crossroad for how black art and black culture are connected. Specifically through music, television, film and social media, black art is not just for the ""African American"" museum space. And here's where Drake's curated playlist comes to life. In I Like It Like This, the rapper matches a Jacob Lawrence piece (The Lovers 1946) with the song Lucille by singer Anthony Hamilton, and Rihanna's hit single Bitch Better Have My Money has been paired with a Lorna Simpson portrait. Though it's hard to understand how some musical pairings are relational at first glance, it's precisely what makes experiencing art so abstract and personal to the individual. In an interview with Vulture, Drake says that his creative process for this collaboration was to think of each painting as a potential album cover and match songs with what he felt complimented each other.  Jacob Lawrence The Lovers, Photo courtesy of Sotheby'sIn general, black art is going through a ""transformative period,"" thanks to huge influences like Drake, whose interest in learning about how to appreciate art, has helped market to a wider demographic. (Think about the influence of Beyonce's selfie with the Mona Lisa and how many people flocked to Paris to take that same picture). Public consumption of art mixed with the biggest drivers of culture are known to promote endless opportunities. Moreover, it spurs dialogue and change. So, there's no denying that Drake's involvement with Sotheby's has attracted a younger crowd of nouveau art aficionados and dilettantes, which made (at the very least) the opening night a success. As proof during the opening party co-hosted by MILK studios, the crowd was a mix of people from all different backgrounds, including: Sotheby's hand-picked clients, many of Drake's friends like Vashtie Kola who also DJ'ed the event, to Andy Warhol muse Jane Holtzer and other notorious downtown socialites. Perhaps the most notable show participant was the lovely Betye Saar who was posing for pictures in front of her mix media piece called The Birth of Blues, 1926, which is a 19th century washboard with a clock serving as the handle and a collage-like picture of a blues band engraved on the washboard. Saar's contributions to the art world has won her many awards including the prestigious 2014 Edward MacDowell Medal. Her photo-op with Drake has since went viral.

On view now until June 12, the 36-piece exhibition encourages visitors to listen to Drake's song selections at listening stations through Beats By Dr. Dre Pro Headphones. The show brings together over 70 years of influential Contemporary black American artists, including Kara Walker, Betye Saar and Jean-Michel Basquiat. As one of the first mainstream exhibitions to incorporate of-the-moment hip hop music, the show serves as a crossroad for how black art and black culture are connected. Specifically through music, television, film and social media, black art is not just for the ""African American"" museum space. And here's where Drake's curated playlist comes to life. In I Like It Like This, the rapper matches a Jacob Lawrence piece (The Lovers 1946) with the song Lucille by singer Anthony Hamilton, and Rihanna's hit single Bitch Better Have My Money has been paired with a Lorna Simpson portrait. Though it's hard to understand how some musical pairings are relational at first glance, it's precisely what makes experiencing art so abstract and personal to the individual. In an interview with Vulture, Drake says that his creative process for this collaboration was to think of each painting as a potential album cover and match songs with what he felt complimented each other.  Jacob Lawrence The Lovers, Photo courtesy of Sotheby'sIn general, black art is going through a ""transformative period,"" thanks to huge influences like Drake, whose interest in learning about how to appreciate art, has helped market to a wider demographic. (Think about the influence of Beyonce's selfie with the Mona Lisa and how many people flocked to Paris to take that same picture). Public consumption of art mixed with the biggest drivers of culture are known to promote endless opportunities. Moreover, it spurs dialogue and change. So, there's no denying that Drake's involvement with Sotheby's has attracted a younger crowd of nouveau art aficionados and dilettantes, which made (at the very least) the opening night a success. As proof during the opening party co-hosted by MILK studios, the crowd was a mix of people from all different backgrounds, including: Sotheby's hand-picked clients, many of Drake's friends like Vashtie Kola who also DJ'ed the event, to Andy Warhol muse Jane Holtzer and other notorious downtown socialites. Perhaps the most notable show participant was the lovely Betye Saar who was posing for pictures in front of her mix media piece called The Birth of Blues, 1926, which is a 19th century washboard with a clock serving as the handle and a collage-like picture of a blues band engraved on the washboard. Saar's contributions to the art world has won her many awards including the prestigious 2014 Edward MacDowell Medal. Her photo-op with Drake has since went viral. By the end of the opening party, as guests slowly made their way downtown to Milk Studios (where the official afterparty was being held), photos and videos from I Like It Like This were already circulating on social, surfacing on millenial fan pages and other unique brand pages that wouldn't of known about such amazing black artists if Drake wasn't involved.

17,HEALTHY LIVING,Dare To Be Naive!,"Fabiana Fondevila, ContributorJournalist and children's book author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dare-to-be-naive_b_7266416.html,"""Dare to be naive!"" I utter that phrase to myself like a mantra. I know that to be astonished by the force of life, by that mystery that keeps us striving and sometimes thriving, is probably our most important assignment.",2015-05-13,"A bird starts its flight from a tree in Limburg, western Germany, on December 9, 2014. AFP PHOTO / DPA / FRANK RUMPENHORST +++ GERMANY OUT (Photo credit should read FRANK RUMPENHORST/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ec69c2000004e00fe7d9f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A pigeon builds its nest on the highest branch of the willow tree outside my house. It flies up and down carrying twigs of all shapes and sizes: short, long, thick, thin, straight, curved. A little while ago, a heavier sprig gave it more trouble and it struggled for several minutes before it managed to lift it off the ground. I can't see the nest behind the leaves, but I can imagine its labors: the slow weaving together of all those twigs until they form a web and, eventually, a solid foothold for life. I could watch it come and go all day. It has no fancy moves, no discernible grace. Pigeons and their nests are not precisely charming or colorful. And yet there is something in the bird's comings and goings that calls to me powerfully. What moves that pigeon to keep swooping down for those twigs? What drives it to work tirelessly hour after hour, day after day until that formless pile becomes a refuge worthy of what it's about to receive?It would be easy to speak of instinct, of biological imperative, of genetic inheritance. But none of that means much to the part of me that watches in amazement, brimming with sympathy and connection. I too once built a nest to welcome my little ones, I think. I too chose the materials carefully, lodged it upon a sheltering branch, waited patiently for the ripening. It was an act spurred by mysterious forces; motivation and awareness seem too shallow a description. How I see myself in that pigeon flying up with heavy beak, so thoroughly focused on the one task that matters.And then there's the willow. After developing a steep inclination to one side it has recently started sprouting low branches in the opposite direction in a futile but heroic attempt at balance. How many times do we grow brave branches to try to counterbalance our weaknesses? And if those branches don't do the trick, is the aspiration any less worthy? I find it impossible to walk by that tree without seeing in its efforts a palpable form of intelligence, a tenacious leaning towards life, a purpose; and, at the same time, to feel moved by the insufficiency of that effort. In fact, that dogged will to thwart the inevitable echoes in me above all else. Maybe it's naive to see myself in the branches, in the tree, in the pigeon. If it is, let me say with Richard Buckminster Fuller, that inspired inventor, ""Dare to be naive!"" I utter that phrase to myself like a mantra every time I start doubting these impressions because I know that the well from which they spring is deep. I know that to be astonished by the force of life, by that mystery that keeps us striving and sometimes thriving, is probably our most important assignment. I know that treasuring the invisible string that links beak to branch to eyes that see and heart that rejoices might be a form of reverence, a wordless sort of prayer. Then I remember Mary Oliver, who in her poem 'Messenger' asks,Am I no longer young, and still not half perfect? Let me keep my mind on what matters, which is my work, which is mostly standing still and learning to be astonished.And so I stay. I look at the buckled tree, at the pigeon in its tireless rounds, and I smile at the mystery, at the effort, at the grace.This blog post is part of a series for HuffPost Gratitude, entitled 'The Moment Gratitude Changed My Perspective.'

We are all aging from the moment we slide out the birth canal. However, instead of aging gracefully, I choose to ""Live Joyfully"" ...out loud and with contentment.",2015-05-13,"Travis and I were running late... literally. I huffed and puffed as we ran down Broadway to get to the theatre... Wicked Gershwin Theatre Manhattan, NYC January 23nd, 2008",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb67421240000510056c435.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The long summer nights seemed to go on forever. I laid on the cot placed out for me, clothed only in a small child's t-shirt and panties, feeling uncomfortable sweat rolling down my body from my hair to my toes. Humidity took July summer nights on an East Texas oil lease and made 104 evening temps feel like 120. The house was not only thick with summer heat, but also from attitudes of the residents. Fear didn't grow just from the heat and the mosquitoes which accompanied our trips to my grandparents (once they counted over 102 mosquito bites on me when a screen was left off a window at night), but it was mostly fear of the woman we called Maw-Maw. She daily raged into the front room, after my younger brothers and I crossed her lines, with wild gray hair pointing to the sky, a long apron choking her waist, and frantically swinging a broom. In my 8-year-old mind, she might as well have been yelling, ""I'll get you, my pretty!!"" The scene had everything but flying monkeys.Unfortunately, I cannot tell you I learned how to age gracefully from the women in my life. Both grandmothers and my mother were embittered by family alcoholics, abuse, and pain. They all were the stereotypical ""mean old ladies."" People you want to run from because they suck the air right out of you. However, it is their role modeling and emotional abuse which sent me in a different direction; because, I so did not want to be anything like them. We all go through hard times; it is what we do with those lessons which chart our course.I dreaded any trips to either of the grandparents' houses; anger seeped out of every crevice. The women in my life chose to become victims and allow circumstances to destroy their lives. Anger can be a very selfish emotion, especially when you use it to harm those around you. At times when I feel this selfish anger rising inside of me, I look in the mirror, see my mother and then hear her words. That usually snaps me back into reality.I really am not a fan of the phrase ""Aging Gracefully."" We are all aging from the moment we slide out the birth canal. However, instead of aging gracefully, I choose to ""Live Joyfully"" ...out loud and with contentment. I decided a long time ago not be a victim. Despite any challenges which may come my way -- and they do come -- I choose to live one day at a time with joy. There is something to laugh about every day. There is something to rejoice in every day. We now know from medical studies those who laugh and enjoy life will often live longer, even with terminal cancers. Dr. Terry Grossman writes, ""Other studies have shown that laughter can decrease stress, increase pain tolerance, reduce depression and improve quality of life."" It is never too late to bury anger and replace it with a rock solid determination to enjoy yourself however remaining days you have on this earth. Now, I realize some reading this will be turned off by my ""Pollyanna"" attitude and think with disgust, that there is no way I understand your circumstances.Trust me... I do understand. You can sit there embittered and dry up, or make a choice today to LIVE...,really live. Life goes so fast. We can try every anti-aging product on the market, but, let's face it; nothing stops the process, no matter what we do. My pastor honored his mother on her 90th birthday in a sermon. She was sitting in the audience at the time. I found myself at first very jealous that he grew up in a household which was fun, joyful, educational, challenging and all about serving others. At 90 years of age, I saw an independent woman who still lived in her own home, drove a car, shopped, lunched with girlfriends and loved her freedom. She was the fun grandma with a door wide open and a welcoming place where her grandchildren loved to go. Not a mean old woman, but a vibrant youthful one.I want my grandchildren to love coming to my house. I want them to feel safe and secure sleeping there. I want to be the captivating Glenda pointing their hearts toward home and not the mean old Wicked Witch of the West embittered by what life did not give me. I choose to live joyfully for however long I am here turn on the air conditioner in summer and avoid mosquitoes whenever possible!"
