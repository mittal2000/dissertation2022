That was six months ago, and this week, he'll return to the mound without apologizing for inflicting domestic abuse upon Barnea. In a New York Times feature published Monday on Chapman, he declined to take responsibility for the actions that made him the first player suspended by the MLB for domestic violence:Asked Tuesday if the suspension had given him time to reflect on what happened and consider changes to his behavior, Chapman shook his head.In fairness to Chapman, he has apologized for part of what happened, but not the actual abuse. When his suspension was announced on March 1, Chapman said in a statement, ""I should have exercised better judgment with respect to certain actions, and for that I am sorry.” When pressed the following day on those ambiguous ""certain actions,"" Chapman gave reporters a direct apology -- not to his victim -- but to the bullets he used in his garage. ""I want to take this opportunity -- I want this to be clear -- I'm apologizing because the use of the gun,"" he said, adding that he never harmed Barnea, who, in tandem with prosecutors, declined to press charges after she changed her story to match Chapman's. His March 1 apology, however, misses the point of his suspension. Chapman may understand that firing his gun was wrong, but not why it's problematic. When handing down the suspension, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred explicitly stated it was based on (emphasis ours) ""his use of a firearm and the impact of that behavior on his partner."" So although we don't know if Chapman caused any physical harm to Barnea, based on what we do know, Chapman's actions are still examples of domestic violence.

2,HEALTHY LIVING,Why You Should Be Wary Of Suicide Prevention Apps,"Lisa Rapaport, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-you-should-be-wary-of-suicide-prevention-apps_us_5730bcdae4b0bc9cb0477739,Many apps suggest people reach out to peers -- rather than a crisis hotline or therapist -- for help.,2016-05-09,"File photo dated December 2015 of a Facebook app on an Apple iPhone 6s, as the social media site launched a new feature in the UK to offer support to users who may be suicidal.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5730bdf52200008f0325603c.jpeg?cache=VyJOlqUMx2&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters Health) - Smartphone apps designed to assist with suicide prevention may not necessarily get people in crisis the help they need or send the best messages about mental health, an Australian study suggests.Rather than encourage users to contact a crisis hotline, physician or therapist, many apps are more likely to suggest people reach out to peers for help, the study of 49 apps found.Worse, two apps listed methods of committing suicide, which might be intended as a prevention effort but could give dangerous ideas to people in distress, the authors note in PLoS One.“Technology that reaches people directly including apps, phone conversational agents, and social media will play a huge role in public health and prevention,” said Dr. Eleni Linos, a researcher and epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco who wasn’t involved in the study.“But I think we have yet to see the potential of technology for prevention,” Linos added by email. Suicide is a leading cause of death globally, and there has been a rapid growth in the use of new technologies such as mobile health applications (apps) to help identify and support those at risk. However, it’s unclear whether the content in these apps can actually help people in crisis, or even if some features might be harmful.To assess the potential of apps for suicide prevention, Mark Larsen of the Black Dog Institute at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia and colleagues downloaded 123 apps referring to suicide and selected a subset with interactive features for their analysis. Larsen didn’t respond to requests for comment. The apps were made for Apple’s iPhone and devices running Google’s Android software.Apps tended to focus on a single prevention strategy, although safety-planning apps typically offered an average of about four approaches for prevention, the study found.Peer support was the most common recommendation, suggested in 27 apps.In 14 apps, users were directed to follow safety plans to minimize the risk of suicide with steps such as removing guns or weapons from the home or adding speed dials within the app for people to contact in a crisis.Other common features included referrals to crisis or suicide support hotlines and prompts for users to self-screen for suicide risk, which were included in 13 apps.Three apps recommended physician screenings, while two proposed psychotherapy.One limitation of the study is that apps available in Australia may not be the same as versions distributed in other countries, the authors note. It’s also possible that the apps have been updated since the study was done.There’s also little evidence to suggest which features within apps may be the most effective at preventing suicide.Another issue with apps is that users have to install them and then decide to use them in a crisis, which might not always happen when people feel suicidal, noted Dr. Robert Steinbrook, a researcher at Yale University School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the study. More research is also needed to determine what features in apps encourage people to actually contact crisis hotlines or physicians, Steinbrook added by email.“It is important to not only study the characteristics of smartphone applications but also to obtain information about how they are used,” Steinbrook said.SOURCE: bit.ly/1VAcWeS PLoS One, online April 13, 2016."
3,POLITICS,North Carolina Governor's Bathroom Obsession Has Been Years In The Making,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pat-mccrory-lgbt-transgender-discrimination_us_5730ddf5e4b096e9f09235cf,Pat McCrory has been hating on LGBT people for decades.,2016-05-09,"North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) says he ""wholeheartedly"" opposes discrimination, which means he must think there's another word for forcing transgender women to pee in the same bathroom as him.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5730dea71300001a0138109b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The governor of North Carolina has successfully diverted America's attention away from Donald Trump and onto an equally pressing issue: toilets.Gov. Pat McCrory (R) is at the center of a ""debate"" over which bathrooms transgender people should use. He signed a law in March that, among other things, bans transgender people from using restrooms that match their gender identity, meaning McCrory wants Caitlyn Jenner, who came out as transgender last year, to come with him to the bathroom to reapply her lipstick versus sharing a powder room with Mrs. McCrory. The U.S. Department of Justice told the governor last week that his law violates the Civil Rights Act. McCrory responded Monday by filing a lawsuit, which prompted the Justice Department to file its own lawsuit.Bathroom use is a priority issue for McCrory, who is up for re-election in November, and it's something he insists is about privacy and not about discriminating against transgender people.""Our nation is one nation. Especially when it comes to fighting discrimination, which I support wholeheartedly,"" the governor said at a Monday press event. ""I want to ensure the people of our state and our country know that North Carolina has long held traditions of ensuring equality.""But a closer look at his record shows he's been hating on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people for decades.McCrory has rejected LGBT anti-discrimination measures every chance he's had in his 25 years in public office. He voted down a Charlotte ordinance in 1991 as a city council member, opposed another one in 2004 as the city's mayor, and now, as governor, he just made it illegal for localities to pass these kinds of protections.""We have laws in our Constitution which forbid discrimination based on race, gender and religion,"" McCrory said after opposing the 1991 measure. ""Beyond that, no other group should be given special status, and this community is often wanting special status.""He had a chance in 2014 to offer protections to LGBT government workers, when he signed an executive order barring discrimination against state employees. But he specifically left them out, keeping the order limited to discrimination based on ""race, religion, color, national origin, sex, age disability and genetic information.""He hasn't just opposed anti-discrimination measures. As the mayor of Charlotte, a post he held from 1995 to 2009, McCrory defended a local YMCA for rejecting a gay man's application for membership. The club turned away local resident Tom Landry in 2006 when he tried to join with his partner and son. Landry wrote to McCrory about it, and he wrote back, ""Thank for letting me know about your situation in trying to secure a membership at the YMCA. The YMCA has every right to set their membership criteria, but as you found, Charlotte has many options for health club memberships, including the Jewish Community Center.""McCrory was also no fan of the Charlotte Gay Pride Festival. As the city's mayor in 2005, he said it wasn't appropriate to have the parade in a public place. He suggested the LGBT celebration ""belongs in a hotel."" That same year, he refused to write a welcome letter to leaders of the Human Rights Campaign when they hosted a large dinner in Charlotte. He said later that he had the right ""not to show any visible support"" for the LGBT rights group.The governor has even gone after local theater productions. In 1996, as mayor, he pressured the Charlotte Repertory Theatre to tone down the nudity and gay themes in its production of ""Angels in America,"" the Pulitzer Prize-winning play about the AIDS crisis. ""The Pulitzer Prize does not give you license to break the law,"" McCrory said at the time. The theater had to obtain a court injunction to continue with its show.Requests for comment from the governor’s office were not returned.McCrory's new law doesn't just target transgender people; it bars cities from passing their own LGBT anti-discrimination ordinances. But the bathroom provision has received the most attention, namely because of the backlash it triggered. The state has lost millions of dollars in revenue from companies and organizations taking their business elsewhere, and from performers like Bruce Springsteen who canceled concerts in protest."

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572d0c192200008f03255dd3.jpeg?cache=11shPwqcd5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Don McGahn’s picture is conspicuously missing from the wall of former commissioners at the Federal Election Commission, and it’s nowhere on the agency’s website.The former FEC chairman’s presence, though, is still felt, nearly three years after he resigned from the commission. Former colleagues and fellow lawyers describe him as a disruptor who proudly upended enforcement policies and contributed to the FEC’s current gridlocked state.“I came here to work, to change the way the place thinks. I was proven right time and time again by court cases,” McGahn told the Center for Public Integrity shortly after stepping down.McGahn is now a key player for the presidential campaign machine of an even more disruptive Donald — presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump — who’s rocketing toward a likely general election showdown with Democrat Hillary Clinton.But the two Donalds are most curious partners.Their working relationship’s tangled roots reach back decades to Atlantic City, where McGahn’s powerful uncle represented Trump’s business interests — until the alliance cracked in a bitter feud over money.And the younger McGahn and Trump are hardly ideological soulmates. Trump has repeatedly railed against what he considers the poison of special-interest money in politics, while McGahn is best known for helping special interests play politics with as few restrictions as possible. Perhaps it’s a marriage of convenience between a brash billionaire and one of the savviest campaign lawyers his money can buy. Regardless, McGahn is one of a small group of insiders who have been standing at Trump’s side since the mogul launched his unlikely, odds-defying bid last June.McGahn has up to now operated mostly in the background — neither he nor the Trump organization would comment. But as the Trump campaign prepares its general election battle plan, McGahn, as campaign counsel, will inevitably serve as a powerful weapon in Trump’s quest for the Oval Office.'Like a sledgehammer'If Trump wins? Previous campaign lawyers to White House contenders have later molded administration policy in important respects. This means one of the nation’s most polarizing election lawyers could return to center stage — and not just thanks to the classic rock cover band he plays guitar with on weekends.McGahn was “perhaps the most consequential member of the FEC in its history” said Jan Witold Baran, a well-regarded Republican election lawyer and co-chairman of the election law and government ethics practice at law firm Wiley Rein. Baran said McGahn checked the authority of the agency’s staff and general counsel and used his experience as a lawyer representing clients to win rights for political committees under the FEC’s jurisdiction, including those the commission is investigating.FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, a Democratic appointee, who frequently clashed with McGahn while both were on the commission, sees it differently.“He was consequential like a sledgehammer was consequential,” she said, adding, “he did his best to undermine the law.”Boardwalk to BeltwayMcGahn, 47, grew up in Atlantic City, New Jersey, a place for people who aren’t afraid to roll the dice.He graduated from the University of Notre Dame and received his law degree at Widener University in 1994. He worked on campaign and election law at then-Washington powerhouse Patton Boggs and was for a time an in-house lawyer for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the Republican campaign arm for the U.S. House of Representatives.He has also represented the campaign of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas, who faced a series of investigations in connection with his handling of political contributions. McGahn’s wife, Shannon McGahn, now staff director for the House Financial Services Committee, is a former spokeswoman for DeLay, and the former lawmaker attended their 2011 wedding. The couple has two young sons.McGahn developed a reputation as an iconoclast: a Republican election lawyer who for a long time wore his shaggy hair long and played a mean Les Paul guitar for Scott’s New Band, hitting power chords on everything from Whitesnake to AC/DC. “A beast on stage” with “skills as sharp as a samurai sword,” his band bio boasts.When President George W. Bush nominated him to the FEC in 2008, some observers criticized McGahn as too partisan, even for an agency whose commissioners were expected to be associated with a party.Now, of course, McGahn is working for Trump — a candidate whose rise has prompted countless pundits to posit the imminent destruction of the same Republican Party with which McGahn is so closely identified.One parlor game in legal circles is guessing how Trump and McGahn connected in the first place.A key clue is pedigree: Don McGahn is just the latest McGahn Trump has turned to for legal help.Back in the dayIn the early 1980s, when Trump was getting into the Atlantic City casino business, projects hinged on navigating the local regulatory process.Patrick “Paddy” McGahn, New Jersey’s most highly decorated Korean War hero, was a political power broker. “Probably the resort’s best known and most powerful lawyer, his fees reportedly were the highest in town” — $300 an hour — according to the book ""Trumped!,"" by John R. O’Donnell, a former president of the Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City.In 1982, when Trump needed potentially valuable air rights for a casino project, Paddy McGahn pushed approval through in “lightning speed” and at a minimal price — $100, according to Nelson Johnson’s book “Boardwalk Empire.""“McGahn was the one who was able to work the crowd and get whatever Trump wanted done,” said Don Targan, a personal injury lawyer in Atlantic City who was close friends with Paddy McGahn for decades, until Paddy McGahn’s death in 2000.Trump and Paddy McGahn were at one point so close, O’Donnell wrote, that Trump named a cocktail lounge in the grand Trump Taj Mahal casino “Paddy’s Saloon.”In the early 1990s, however, Trump’s casino empire began to fall apart.Trump Plaza’s lawyers, amidst the bankruptcy of their hotel/casino, challenged in federal court both Paddy McGahn’s bills and the effectiveness of his work.With hundreds of thousands of dollars and his reputation at stake, Paddy McGahn fought back. Both Targan and McGahn’s lawyer in the case, Arthur J. Abramowitz, said the late war hero took the case personally.“There was a falling out with a lot of animosity,” Abramowitz said. “[Paddy McGahn] had a lot of pride in what he did, and when somebody says that you do something not up to standards, I think it’s more than just denial of a debt.”Abramowitz, who said he also represented other creditors in connection with the Trump bankruptcies, said it is unusual for a debtor to level allegations against a lawyer such as the ones leveled against Paddy McGahn — and McGahn was hit hard by it.The two sides eventually filed documents with the court saying they had settled the case. The exact terms weren’t immediately available, but the order approving the settlement said Paddy McGahn was entitled to go back to court if Trump Plaza Associates failed to pay the money owed under the agreement. Both Abramowitz and Targan recall that Paddy McGahn collected a significant settlement from Trump Plaza Associates, though they don’t recollect a precise amount.As for Paddy McGahn’s nephew’s current representation of Trump, Targan said, it “is amazing to me, and it just happened to be a freak of nature.”Paddy McGahn, Targan added, is “probably turning over in his grave.”Odd coupleMost every lawyer says it’s unfair to assume an attorney shares his or her clients’ views.Even so, the disconnect between public stances taken by Trump and those taken by Don McGahn is striking.McGahn has often cited free speech grounds in opposing restrictions on campaign spending, and he’s pushed back against federal enforcement cases, arguing that they could chill political speech.“When elected officials are able to handicap and silence their electoral opponents, they will rarely refrain from doing so,” McGahn wrote last year, in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Clinton’s campaign finance reform proposals.McGahn is also known as a strong proponent of political parties.Trump, in contrast, has called for revamping libel laws to make lawsuits easier to bring, something that makes most free speech proponents look askance. He has also repeatedly criticized the role the Republican National Committee has played in the primary process. He has yet to lay out specific proposals for overhauling the current system for regulating money in politics, but has repeatedly said the status quo breeds corruption.“The system is broken,” he said during a Republican debate in March. “And frankly, I know the system better than anybody else, and I'm the only one up here that's going to be able to fix that system because that system is wrong.”Trump’s assertion is steeped in hyperbole: There’s no way he knows the system as well as McGahn.From 1999 until 2008, when McGahn was a lawyer for the National Republican Congressional Committee, he was an insider’s insider.McGahn — together with fellow Republican FEC appointees Caroline Hunter and Matthew Petersen, currently chairman of the commission — then formed a powerful, united voting block from 2008 until he left the FEC toreturn to private practice at Patton Boggs in 2013. (He’s since jumped to another firm, Jones Day).McGahn’s FEC tenure coincided with a series of federal court rulings, including the Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, which increasingly deregulated how campaign cash may be raised and spent. On a parallel track, McGahn and his allies drove changes in the way the commission did business, especially concerning how they punished — or didn’t punish — political actors suspected of violating federal rules and regulations.“Whether you agreed with him or not he was a force to reckon with,” said Petersen, who was appointed to the agency at the same time as McGahn and allied with him throughout his tenure.A force? Yes. A positive force? No, says former FEC general counsel Lawrence M. Noble, who is now general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that was often at odds with McGahn.“His impact on the agency was to continue moving the agency down the road to where it is today, which is a non-enforcement agency,” Noble said, adding that McGahn was continually questioning “long-standing interpretations of the law and saying he would not go along with it.”But Michael Toner, a former FEC chairman who is now co-chair of the election law practice at Wiley Rein, praised McGahn as a “forceful advocate” who “really was a driving force in shaping” the FEC’s post-Citizens United form. “He served at a time when there were a lot of changes in the judicial landscape … and the FEC had to grapple with how to proceed, to be blunt,"" Toner said. The FEC today, three years after McGahn’s departure, is known as a reluctant enforcer. The six commissioners, three backed by each political party, are frequently gridlocked and often at each other’s throats, and the agency is fighting low staff morale. Fines assessed by the agency fell from a high of $6.71 million in fiscal year 2006 to less than $1 million in 2015.Just like his high-profile client, Trump, McGahn is an iconoclastic lightning rod, not known for backing away from a brawl or breaking bread with opponents afterwards.“I would never have characterized him as a go-along, get-along guy,” said Ken Jones, a friend and former colleague of McGahn’s at the law firm Patton Boggs and a former lawyer for both the Republican National Committee and the Bush-Cheney presidential campaign in 2000.During McGahn’s tenure at the FEC, he was a frequent target for watchdog groups who said he was crippling the FEC’s ability to enforce the law and destroying morale among the agency’s staff through his reluctance to proceed with enforcement cases. Noble once described him as a commissioner who “did his best to make the FEC dysfunctional.”Doubling downThe Trump campaign’s filings with the FEC show it has made more than $833,000 in payments to McGahn’s firm, Jones Day, since the campaign started.March brought the firm’s highest bills yet — nearly $162,000. Last month, the Trump campaign brought on a second Jones Day partner, William McGinley, a colleague of McGahn’s in the political law practice, to help with its delegate operation.McGahn’s portfolio with the Trump campaign clearly goes beyond basic advice on campaign finance.McGahn beat back an attempt to strip Trump’s name from the critical New Hampshire ballot late last year, then stood behind the candidate on a stage in Manchester in February as Trump delivered his first victory speech of the campaign.He raised concerns with the Nevada Republican Party after Trump’s then-rival for the nomination, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, suggested supporters record “anything that looks suspicious” when entering caucus sites in Nevada. In a letter, McGahn said the Cruz campaign’s recommendation was “especially troubling given Senator Cruz and his campaign’s track record of election shenanigans,” and then went on to a series of bullet points highlighting accusations of dishonesty by the Cruz campaign.McGahn’s letter asked the Nevada Republican Party to clarify whether the taping is permissible “and make clear that voter intimidation tactics will not be tolerated.”McGahn has also written letters demanding that outside groups, including super PACs, stop raising money using Trump’s name and likeness.In March, McGahn helped organize a meeting between Trump and Republicans, including U.S. Reps. Scott DesJarlais, R-Tenn.; Chris Collins, R-N.Y.; and Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., as well as former Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., at the Washington, D.C., offices of Jones Day.Jones Day is, by some reports, the largest law firm in the country, with nearly 1,700 lawyers. This number includes roughly 250 lawyers in a D.C. office boasting sweeping views of the Capitol. It’s endured a series of reports about whether the attention Trump has drawn to the firm would prompt Jones Day to drop Trump as a client.Not only has that not happened, the ties between the two appear to be solidifying, with McGinley also representing the billionaire businessman. The two lawyers traveled to Florida in April as part of a group representing Trump at a Republican National Committee meeting there.In the end, though, no one knows exactly what advice McGahn is giving Trump — or whether his client is listening to it.Former colleague Jones, while stressing that he isn’t familiar with the details of McGahn’s representation of Trump, said part of McGahn’s job is obviously dealing with the intricacies of arcane campaign finance law.In addition, “part of Don’s job is to educate the candidate and the campaign as to what is a good position to take as the Republican front-runner” on money and politics, Jones said.“Sometimes, the popular answer may not be the right answer. There’s a difference between making a sound bite about money and politics and truly understanding the interaction between money and politics and the federal government,” Jones added.Brad Smith, a former FEC chairman who now leads the Center for Competitive Politics, a nonprofit that advocates for less campaign finance regulation, said: “Lawyers have to represent the interest of your client, but I think good lawyers also try to take on the old term of counselor and counsel their clients as to true long-term interest.”McGahn has never been one to worry about the popular answer.Whether he’ll be more willing to have his photograph associated with the Trump campaign than he was with the FEC remains to be seen.This piece is published in partnership with The Center for Public Integrity.

Both Goldberg and Rozen described the description as false, even slanderous, and criticized the paper for failing to seek comment ahead of time.“This is an unsupported, defamatory allegation that somehow slipped into The New York Times Magazine by a guy, it should be pointed out, who has had a grudge against me for several years,"" Goldberg told HuffPost. (He later wrote of once accepting, then declining, a position at Tablet, where Samuels was a senior editor and Samuels' wife is editor). On Monday, Times Magazine Editor-in-Chief Jake Silverstein defended the article’s language, telling HuffPost that the publication did not mean to imply the veteran journalists “were colluding with the administration.” Silverstein did acknowledge, however, that magazine should have asked for their response prior to publication.In the much-discussed profile, Samuels explored how the White House pushes its foreign policy narrative in the media and, specifically in the case of the Iran nuclear deal, how the administration was able to spin “often clueless reporters.” Rhodes candidly described creating an “echo chamber” in which experts speaking to reporters validated the administration’s arguments. And Rhodes offered his unvarnished thoughts on how some reporters lack the experience and expertise of their predecessors.“They call us to explain to them what’s happening in Moscow and Cairo,” Rhodes said. “Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That’s a sea change. They literally know nothing.”But later in the article, it’s Samuels who specifically identifies Goldberg and Rozen, each of whom have reported on foreign affairs for decades, as having helped promote the administration’s narrative.As [Director of Digital Response for the White House Office of Digital Strategy Tanya Somanader] explained how the process worked, I was struck by how naïve the assumption of a “state of nature” must seem in an information environment that is mediated less and less by experienced editors and reporters with any real prior knowledge of the subjects they write about. “People construct their own sense of source and credibility now,” she said. “They elect who they’re going to believe.” For those in need of more traditional-seeming forms of validation, handpicked Beltway insiders like Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor helped retail the administration’s narrative. “Laura Rozen was my RSS feed,” Somanader offered. “She would just find everything and retweet it.”Rozen said in an email that she is “seeking a correction from the editor and an apology for misleading and inaccurate assertions made about me” in the profile.“The New York Times Magazine editor has already acknowledged to me that the magazine made a mistake by failing to give me a serious chance to respond and offer my blanket objection,” she wrote.“The magazine slandered me without speaking to me; or giving me a reasonable chance to strongly object,” she added. “Samuels mischaracterizes the meaning of what the White House aide said to him about me: that she reads my Twitter feed. I should not have been named in the piece at all based on Samuels’ mischaracterization of her quote. It was a drive by shooting.”In covering the Iran nuclear talks for four years, Rozen said her Twitter feed “has become one of the go-to follows for people around the world interested in this issue,” and that the information she tweets and retweets “comes from a wide range of news sources, journalists, diplomats, governments, experts of broad and varied ideological views on Iran and many other foreign policy and political issues.”In an email, Silverstein expressed support for the writer’s “helped retail” characterization, while acknowledging the two journalists should’ve been contacted.“As I've told Goldberg and Rozen, we should have asked them for a response, and I regret that we did not do so,” Silverstein told HuffPost. “As I also expressed to them, when David used the phrase ‘helped retail’ he did not mean to imply that Goldberg or Rozen were colluding with the administration. Rather, he meant that certain people within the White House were retailing their talking points, and that they saw Goldberg and Rozen as helpful in doing so. David's extensive reporting supports this assertion. It is also important to note that David's piece is about a system for crafting and disseminating policy narratives, and because of his remarkable access, he was able to describe that system from the perspective of the people who operate it.""In a phone interview, Silverstein suggested the genesis of the article -- which has prompted both criticism of the writer and the administration since being published online Thursday and in Sunday’s print edition -- was fairly conventional. Samuels, a veteran magazine writer, pitched Times Magazine editors late last year on a profile of Rhodes. Silverstein said the magazine was interested in looking at how a 38-year-old with a background in creative writing was now “playing such a critical role in the formation and distribution of American foreign policy.”“That idea was very interesting to us, this idea of storytelling and narratives and the role they play in the way the Obama administration not only communicates its message, but shapes its message in the first place,” Silverstein said.This is familiar territory for the magazine, which last year examined how the Obama White House communicated details of Osama bin Laden's death through the press. That cover story drew criticism from some prominent Washington journalists, including several in the paper's own Washington bureau.After getting a commitment from Times editors, Samuels approached Rhodes, who not only agreed to an interview, but also provided extensive access and offered surprisingly candid assessments of the foreign policy establishment and the press.In recent days, critics of Samuels’ framing of events have seized on video of an April 2015 panel as evidence of his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal.At the Hudson Institute event, Samuels described being ""startled by the lack of attention and clarity” in much of what had been reported on the Iran deal, and suggested cutbacks in the media business led to a situation in which the Obama administration's claims weren't being as thoroughly vetted as they would've been in the past. “What happens to a Democratic society when you decide to do away with the institutions of a free press? Because that is a decision, without knowing it, our country has made.” he said. During the panel, Samuels described an apocalyptic scenario of “unchecked nuclear proliferation in a world where the United States has decided that it will no longer enforce the very, very basic structures we put in place after World War II in order to prevent the horror of a world in which many, many states, some of them led by people whose perceptions of reality depart from our own in very significant ways, are armed with weapons whose capacity to kill hundreds of thousands of people and to destroy if used in great numbers the basic functioning of not just individual societies but of large chunks of the global system that feeds and provides basic security to billions of human beings on the planet.”“This is a terrifying, terrifying prospect,” he said. “And that’s what’s at stake in this deal. And the inability of people to recognize that that is what we are talking about is, in part, tied to the institutional collapse of the structures in which I’ve spent a good deal of my own life working.""Samuels argued in Slate in 2009 that Israel should bomb Iran before it can develop a nuclear weapon. During the Hudson Institute panel, he said it was wrong to take the possibility of a military strike off the table during negotiations. The Times Magazine story doesn’t mention Samuels’ past, public concerns with the Iran deal.“I don’t really find that stuff to be relevant to what David did here,” Silverstein said.“The engine of this piece was the trust that David was able to build with Ben Rhodes, who was one of the primary architects of how that deal was crafted and disseminated,” Silverstein added. The Times Magazine editor said that Rhodes apparently “felt that he was going to be getting a fair shake” from Samuels given the access he provided. “I don’t believe he feels he was burned by David either,” Silverstein said of Rhodes. “I think David told a very compelling story and one that is true and accurate.”""I’ve seen some people saying this was an ideological hit job, which is just ridiculous. I’ve also seen people saying it was a puff piece, which is also ridiculous,"" Silverstein added. ""I sort of take it as a mark of the success of the piece that it’s been such widely divergent reads on it. I think it’s a complicated story, one with a lot of nuance, and one that can’t be easily fit into a particular category.""Rhodes took to Medium late Sunday night to respond to the story and explain how the White House advocated for the Iran deal. He was more complimentary toward the press this time around, writing that “there was no shortage of good reporting and analysis — positive, negative, and mixed — about the Iran deal.”He also disputed the idea that Goldberg was hand-picked to help “retail” the White House’s message in a response to Goldberg. “I told him that our goal was to try to convince you and a handful of other columnists that the Iran deal wasn’t a total catastrophe,” Rhodes recalled of his discussion with Samuels. “I told him I don’t think I ever convinced you that it was a good deal.”This story was updated with comments from Silverstein and more information on Samuels' past comments on the Iran deal."

7,POLITICS,Obama Administration Sues North Carolina Over Anti-LGBT Bathroom Bill,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-bathroom-bill-sued_us_5730c297e4b016f3789674e8,"The Justice Department says the law ""stigmatizes and singles out"" transgender people.",2016-05-09,"North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) called on Congress Monday to help clarify the state's controversial ""bathroom bill.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5730c490160000e90031e2bc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Monday filed a lawsuit against the state of North Carolina, alleging that a bill that blocks protections for transgender people violates federal law. The Justice Department said in a lawsuit that the so-called ""bathroom bill"" ""stigmatizes and singles out transgender employees, results in their isolation and exclusion, and perpetuates a sense that they are not worthy of equal treatment and respect.""A person's external genitals, the feds said, are ""but one component of sex and not always determinative of a person's sex.""DOJ's lawsuit highlights statements by North Carolina officials in support of the law, including a statement from Lt. Gov. Dan Forest (R), who has said that a proposed anti-discrimination ordinance in Charlotte ""would have given pedophiles, sex offenders, and perverts free rein to watch women, boys and girls undress and use the bathroom.""Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the lawsuit “is about a great deal more than just bathrooms” and affects the “dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens.” Speaking directly to the citizens of North Carolina, where she herself was born and raised, Lynch said the law inflicts ""further indignity on a population that has already suffered far more than its fair share.""""This is not the first time that we have seen discriminatory responses to historic moments of progress for our nation,” Lynch said. “We saw it in the Jim Crow laws that followed the Emancipation Proclamation. We saw it in fierce and widespread resistance to Brown v. Board of Education. And we saw it in the proliferation of state bans on same-sex unions intended to stifle any hope that gay and lesbian Americans might one day be afforded the right to marry.""""That right, of course, is now recognized as a guarantee embedded in our Constitution, and in the wake of that historic triumph, we have seen bill after bill in state after state taking aim at the LGBT community,"" she went on. ""Some of these responses reflect a recognizably human fear of the unknown, and a discomfort with the uncertainty of change. But this is not a time to act out of fear. This is a time to summon our national virtues of inclusivity, diversity, compassion and open-mindedness.""The attorney general added that ""what we must not do -- what we must never do -- is turn on our neighbors, our family members, our fellow Americans, for something they cannot control, and deny what makes them human. This is why none of us can stand by when a state enters the business of legislating identity and insists that a person pretend to be something they are not, or invents a problem that doesn’t exist as a pretext for discrimination and harassment.”The administration's lawsuit, announced at a press conference at Justice Department headquarters, came the same day that North Carolina officials sued the federal government for threatening to withhold federal education funds after DOJ's Civil Rights Division informed the state that the bathroom measure violated federal civil rights laws. North Carolina's lawsuit against the feds maintains that the state is ""protecting the bodily privacy rights of state employees"" and that the Justice Department is engaged in ""baseless and blatant overreach"" of its authority.The Justice Department has argued that gender discrimination can occur against people who do not conform to gender stereotypes, such as transgender students. The Obama administration told an appeals court last year that “treating a student adversely because the sex assigned to him at birth does not match his gender identity is literally discrimination ‘on the basis of sex.'"" The appeals court ruled in favor of a trans student who was denied bathroom access.North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) said at a Monday press conference that the country was ""dealing with a very new, complex and emotional issue"" that involved ""balancing privacy and equality."" He called on Congress to clarify the law rather than allowing the executive and judicial branches to interpret whether laws intended to protect against gender discrimination also protected transgender individuals.

Following two back-to-back performances at one of the nation's biggest music festivals, the singer made it to the East Coast for a much more intimate affair. The event, hosted by Afropunk and Jose Cuervo, was inspired by the tequila brand's new ethos, ""Cuervo, no chaser,"" the catchy lyric pulled straight from Beyoncé's ""Formation.""SZA started her set off slow, opting to open with her vocals from Rihanna's ""Consideration."" The song, which SZA co-wrote, is one of the singer's most recent collaborations -- one that marks her latest stride toward wider mainstream visibility. But while chatting with The Huffington Post after the show, SZA seemed remarkably modest about the journey. ""It was definitely just a random blessing,"" she said, looking back on her experience with the ""Work"" singer. ""I made a song [Rihanna] connected to, and it just happened. She was super humble, just about everything. So it was really like, just a warm moment.""That ""random blessing,"" which made it onto Rihanna's eighth studio album, ""Anti,"" even served as the opener to Rih's BRIT Awards performance. It was yet another surprise and a first in SZA's budding career. ""That was crazy. I was totally unprepared for that. I can't even,"" she said. ""That's all I can say about it. I was totally unprepared. I've never done anything like that. Like an award show? Even rehearsing for it, I was like, 'What is this?'"" In expressing her disbelief over traveling to London, her first-ever trip to the city, SZA took a moment to laugh about the experience and a candid glimpse of the singer's personality peeked through. ""I made fun of everyone. All day. They talk so weird,"" she said, remembering the unmistakable cadence of the London accent. ""It was too easy. It was amazing because [it's like] you're in 'Madeline.' You're in f*cking 'Madeleine.' It's crazy. You have to tell everyone.""Her throwback reference was to the 1998 live-action film adaptation of the children's book Madeline, a story of an all-girls boarding school in Paris (which featured way too many British accents for a movie that was supposedly set in France). As it turns out, SZA is quite the '90s pop culture fanatic. She credited her fearlessly eclectic, old-school aesthetic to the television shows and movies of her childhood. ""I think it's a mixture of everything we've seen in life. Watching like 'The Wonder Years,' and 'Doug,' [and] 'Clarissa Explains It All,'"" she said. ""Or even 'Clueless,' but I wasn't that girly. I always took it like very 'Dawson's Creek' random. Drew Barrymore [in] 'Never Been Kissed.'""Dressed in a crop top, styled with baggy jeans and some classic black high-top Vans, her laid-back, '90s stylistic influences were obvious -- a sign that the singer's penchant for thrifted pieces is still going strong. In fact, SZA's authenticity was palpable in more ways than one. At one point during the interview, a friend of the singer's stepped into the conversation to ask for SZA's phone number, which she had lost unexpectedly. ""I've had the same number since eighth grade,"" SZA replied, as she punched her contact information into her friend's phone. The conversation eventually turned to her fellow Top Dawg Entertainment signees, two of whom made appearances at the singer's Coachella set. As SZA discussed her relationships with talented Tennessee native Isaiah Rashad and Compton's shining star Kendrick Lamar, it was obvious that her connections with her TDE labelmates run deep.""That's like really my family. I feel like people throw that word around a lot, but that's really my family,"" she said. ""We slept on couches together. Me and 'Zay lived together for two years. And all the other boys, our bond, it's just family sh*t, like I respect them. They're my brothers."" SZA, whose collaborations with K Dot produced tracks like the syrupy slow ""Babylon"" and ""Untitled 04,"" said Kendrick is the introspective, more mature one of the group. ""He's like a little more like quiet. You know like when your older relative doesn't say much, but like the things that they do say are very precise and right on target? So he's Cuervo, no chaser. He's straight up. He doesn't drink, but theoretically!"" she laughed.As for her own music, SZA recently assured Vibe that her album ""A"" is coming soon, but she's taking her time on the project. It’s just another sign that the same SZA who hasn't changed her number in over a decade isn’t willing to rush her creative process for anyone. "

At one point during the interview, a friend of the singer's stepped into the conversation to ask for SZA's phone number, which she had lost unexpectedly. ""I've had the same number since eighth grade,"" SZA replied, as she punched her contact information into her friend's phone. The conversation eventually turned to her fellow Top Dawg Entertainment signees, two of whom made appearances at the singer's Coachella set. As SZA discussed her relationships with talented Tennessee native Isaiah Rashad and Compton's shining star Kendrick Lamar, it was obvious that her connections with her TDE labelmates run deep.""That's like really my family. I feel like people throw that word around a lot, but that's really my family,"" she said. ""We slept on couches together. Me and 'Zay lived together for two years. And all the other boys, our bond, it's just family sh*t, like I respect them. They're my brothers."" SZA, whose collaborations with K Dot produced tracks like the syrupy slow ""Babylon"" and ""Untitled 04,"" said Kendrick is the introspective, more mature one of the group. ""He's like a little more like quiet. You know like when your older relative doesn't say much, but like the things that they do say are very precise and right on target? So he's Cuervo, no chaser. He's straight up. He doesn't drink, but theoretically!"" she laughed.As for her own music, SZA recently assured Vibe that her album ""A"" is coming soon, but she's taking her time on the project. It’s just another sign that the same SZA who hasn't changed her number in over a decade isn’t willing to rush her creative process for anyone. "

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyc-digital-playbook_us_5730de87e4b016f378969a81,"""I get very troubled when I run into bureaucracy that is unyielding and unhelpful.""",2016-05-09,New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Huffington Post Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington at an event Monday at the Civic Hall tech center.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5730e63f2200008f032560be.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- New York Mayor Bill de Blasio launched a website on Monday meant to open up the city government to greater scrutiny from the citizens it serves.On Monday, he announced the new site -- dubbed the city's ""Digital Playbook"" -- will aim to make more services available online, including tools that help citizens communicate with officials about, for example, pot holes or problems with the city's new wireless Internet. ""I get very troubled when I run into bureaucracy that is unyielding and unhelpful,"" de Blasio said at an event hosted by Huffington Post Editor-In-Chief Arianna Huffington at the Civic Hall tech center. ""It really bothers me.""He said antiquated technologies rig the system of governance in favor of the privileged.""We see many elements of our governing reality that feel rigged to people, and in fact often are rigged,"" de Blasio said, acknowledging a buzzword that has become prominent in the populist wave at the forefront of the 2016 presidential election. ""The way to defeat that and the way to overcome it is to open things up.""""You cannot fight the problems of yesterday only with the tools of yesterday,"" he added. ""You need the tools of today.""The mayor outlined six basic principles of the playbook: to be welcoming to New Yorkers of all backgrounds; to provide easy-to-navigate digital tools; to garner and listen to feedback from citizens; to reach people through channels they already use; to keep personal data secure; and to share public data and platforms to improve experiences across different city agencies.""Our goal is to make our services more accessible, make our operations more transparent, and make it easy and fun to participate in government,"" de Blasio wrote in a blog post published on Medium. ""In short — we aim to make New York the most user-friendly and innovative city in the world.""The launch comes amid a burgeoning movement among urban advocates and mayors to better use tech-enabled cities as policy laboratories. Bloomberg Philanthropies, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's charitable arm, has recently expanded its What Works Cities initiative to exchange more ideas between forward-thinking city officials around the world. ""It will take time. Any shift from a status quo is not easy,"" Michele Jolin, chief executive of the nonprofit Results for America and former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, wrote in a blog post last month for HuffPost. ""But, using data and evidence will help city leaders make smarter, more effective decisions and improve lives for city residents.""The announcement comes at a critical point for de Blasio. The left-leaning mayor, who made income and housing inequality core components of his political platform, has been under intense scrutiny over campaign donations from real estate developers. A Marist Poll released last month found that the mayor's approval rating had fallen to 35 percent -- the lowest since he took office. "

Chris Christie to lead his White House transition team.“Governor Christie is an extremely knowledgeable and loyal person with the tools and resources to put together an unparalleled transition team, one that will be prepared to take over the White House when we win in November,” Trump said in a statement on Monday.Christie, himself a former GOP candidate for the presidency, was an early endorser of the brash Manhattan businessman. The governor has been a visible Trump surrogate on the campaign trail, going on the attack against Trump's remaining rivals (before they too bowed out) and against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. There has been speculation that Christie might be tapped for vice president or attorney general in a Trump administration. This week, Trump is holding an event in New Jersey to help pay off Christie's campaign debt, charging attendees $200 per ticket.But things weren't always so rosy between the two tough-talking men. In the campaign's early stages, Christie went after Trump for being a ""carnival barker"" and ""entertainer-in-chief."" Mere hours after Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, Christie, who has spoken passionately about combating anti-Muslim bigotry, labeled it a ""ridiculous"" proposal.Trump reciprocated by attacking Christie over one of the most controversial episodes in his tenure as governor -- the George Washington Bridge scandal.""He knew about it,"" Trump said of Christie at a rally in December. ""He totally knew about it."" Trump didn't confine himself, as some of his rivals did, to merely criticizing Christie's staffing decisions. He alleged that the governor knew of the decision to shutter lanes on the bridge as a form of political retribution against a local mayor -- which would be a federal crime. Christie has repeatedly denied that he knew of other officials' shenanigans. But that's all apparently water under the bridge now. Christie is leading Trump's transition team -- a serious position responsible for helping select White House aides, Cabinet members and other top officials in the event of a Trump victory in November.Never mind that Christie's previous staffing decisions led to the bridge scandal. The people he proposes for government posts will likely be tasked with carrying out the Muslim ban he once railed against.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and the committee's ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) have a heated discussion on Oct. 22, 2015, as Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton testified.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Remember the House Select Committee on Benghazi? The ninth official probe into what really happened in the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. consulate in eastern Libya?It turns two years old today, making it one of the longest-running special congressional investigations in history.But so far, it’s reached no conclusions about the attacks, after the eight other investigations found a number of failures, but no signs of wrongdoing.The only notable revelation by the committee, which has spent nearly $7 million, is that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton kept all her official email on an unsecured private server -- which the FBI is now investigating.The committee has interviewed nearly 100 witnesses, including 75 that it says were never interviewed before.Perhaps that’s enough. But as for shedding any more light on what happened on that night when U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed, it has yet to do so.Members of the committee told Roll Call before going on vacation for all of last week that they were working diligently to come out with a report before the 2016 presidential nominating conventions in July.Representatives for the committee initially declined to offer any updates for this article, but pointed to an extensive list of purported achievements on the committee’s website. (And see updates, below.)Democrats contacted by The Huffington Post had plenty to say.“Republicans have now spent more than two years and nearly $7 million of taxpayer funds for the illegitimate purpose of bringing down Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers, as Kevin McCarthy admitted,” said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the select committee, referring to an unintended admission by the second-ranking Republican in the House.""It has been apparent since the beginning that the Select Committee on Benghazi would be little more than a politically motivated fishing expedition,” said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) a senior Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. He noted that if the costs of other agencies responding to the committee are included in the price tag, taxpayers are on the hook for about $20 million.""As we get even closer to the 2016 general election, all but the most dedicated partisans have written off the committee and its tremendous cost as one of the worst investigative abuses in congressional history,” Schiff said.“The Select Committee has discovered no new evidence that contradicts the core findings of the previous bipartisan and independent investigations,” Cummings said.Cummings also noted that as the committee’s investigation has dragged on, Republicans have progressively cut Democrats out of its workings. Members of the minority are now only allowed to review transcripts of witness interviews, and only with a Republican staffer observing them. They’ve also been excluded from contributing to the committee's report.“Two years and millions of dollars later, Republicans have lost any semblance of credibility as they continue to drag this out as close as they can to the election,” Cummings said.To celebrate the committee entering its third year of existence, Democrats put together a list of 10 “lowlights” of its first two years. Among them are McCarthy’s admission of the political bent of the committee, similar to charges by Rep. Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.) and a former investigator on the GOP staff.The lowlights list also includes the condemnation of the committee by the Republican presumptive nominee for president, Donald Trump, who claimed to be thoroughly unimpressed with the committee after Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).Trump called the committee “a total disaster” that “was not good for Republicans and for the country.” He also tweeted that Gowdy ""failed miserably on Benghazi,” and called him “Benghazi loser Gowdy.”Update:A spokesman for the committee scoffed at the overall cost estimate, and pointed out that some of the committee's direct costs should be attributed to Democrats, who, he noted, have not called any witnesses.“The do-nothing Democrats on the Benghazi Committee have wasted more than $2.3 million in taxpayer money but have only extreme partisanship, lies, selective leaks, and sabotage to show for it,"" said Matt Wolking. ""They aren't even pretending to be interested in getting answers for the families of the victims, and aren't denying coordination with political groups and the Clinton propaganda machine. Their frantic, false attacks are proof they’re clearly nervous about the new information committee investigators have uncovered.”Gowdy insisted in a statement that the committee was breaking new ground, that it would deliver a thorough report, and that it was Democrats who were playing politics:“From the very beginning, the Committee Majority sought to conduct a fair and thorough investigation focused exclusively on the facts. The committee never deviated from this mission, despite Committee Democrats consistently undermining and obstructing our work. It’s quite telling they never requested a single witness or document from this administration in two years – not a single one. Committee Democrats were content to ignore more than 74,000 pages of new documents and the testimony of more than 75 new witnesses. They have been singularly obsessed with politics, as the public will soon learn from the redundant, rote questions they ask witnesses. Despite Democrat obstruction, the committee has identified new facts that significantly impact our understanding of what happened before, during, and after Benghazi.“This investigation and the committee’s final report is about the four brave Americans we lost in Libya, getting the truth for their families and all Americans, and conducting effective congressional oversight to prevent what happened in Benghazi from happening again. Anyone looking for a report focused on the former Secretary of State will be disappointed. This investigation is not about her, and the report will not be about her either. She is an important witness whose decisions impacted virtually all aspects of Benghazi, but she is a single witness among the soon to be 100 interviewed by the committee.“The committee is urging the administration to declassify as many documents as it can, and I look forward to releasing our report and the transcripts of our witness interviews as soon as possible, so everyone can judge the thoroughness and fairness of this investigation for themselves.”This story was updated May 15, 2015, to add comments that were inadvertently not included when the committee provided them after publication."

Ryan said that he was not ready to support Trump on Thursday. Palin, the former Republican vice presidential nominee and Alaska governor who endorsed Trump in January, suggested there would be consequences for Ryan’s decision. ""I think Paul Ryan is soon to be 'Cantored,' as in Eric Cantor,"" Palin said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” referring to the former Republican House majority leader who lost his seat to a tea party-backed primary challenger in a major upset in 2014. ""His political career is over but for a miracle because he has so disrespected the will of the people, and as the leader of the GOP, the convention, certainly he is to remain neutral, and for him to already come out and say who he will not support is not a wise decision of his.” Palin said she would “do whatever I can” for Wisconsin businessman Paul Nehlen, who said Friday he would support Trump if the reality television star were the nominee. Nehlen has an uphill climb to defeat Ryan, who is extremely popular in his home district.""This man is a hard-working guy, so in touch with the people,"" Palin said. ""Paul Ryan and his ilk, their problem is they have become so disconnected by the people whom they are elected to represent.""Palin suggested that Ryan’s reticence on Trump is influenced by his desire to run for president in 2020. ""If the GOP were to win now, that wouldn't bode well for [Ryan’s] chances in 2020, and that's what he's shooting for,"" Palin said."

""This is great firefighting weather, we can really get in here and get a handle on this fire, and really get a death grip on it.""The wildfire scorching through Canada's oil sands region in northeast Alberta had been expected to double in size on Sunday, threatening the neighboring province of Saskatchewan, as it moved into its seventh day.But favorable weather helped hold it back, giving officials hope that they can soon begin assessing the damage to Fort McMurray, close to where the fire started, causing its 88,000 inhabitants to flee.""As more and more fire has burned out around the city and the fuel around the city starts to disappear... we are starting to move into that second phase of securing the site and assessing the site,"" said Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, during the same media briefing.Officials said it was too early to put a timeline on getting people back into the town safely.The broader wildfire, moving southeast through wooded areas away from the town, would still take a long time to ""clean up,"" Morrison cautioned. Officials had previously warned that the fire could burn for months.An Alberta government statement issued on Saturday night said the fire had consumed 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) - an area the size of Mexico City - and would continue to grow.Fort McMurray is the center of Canada's oil sands region. About half of the crude output from the sands, or one million barrels per day, had been taken offline as of Friday, according to a Reuters estimate.The inferno looks set to become the costliest natural disaster in Canada's history. One analyst estimated insurance losses could exceed C$9 billion ($7 billion).Officials said on Sunday the fire had done minor damage at CNOOC unit Nexen's Long Lake facility, in the site's yard. It was the first reported damage to an energy industry asset since the crisis began.Morrison said the fire was southwest of a Suncor Energy Inc facility, which Suncor identified as its base oil sands mining site north of Fort McMurray, and also near an unidentified Syncrude facility.Air tankers, helicopters and bulldozers had kept the fire from reaching those sites, said Morrison: “We’ll see how the day goes, but with the cooler weather, I do expect to hold the fire there.""FORT MCMURRAY STILL OFF LIMITSEven though the fire has largely pushed through Fort McMurray, the town is still too dangerous to enter.Thousands of evacuees are camped out in nearby towns but stand little chance of returning soon, even if their homes are intact. The city's gas has been turned off, its power grid is damaged, and the water is undrinkable.Provincial officials said displaced people would be better off driving to cities such as Calgary, 655 km (410 miles) to the south, where health and social services were better.The provincial government has promised evacuees pre-paid debit cards to cover immediate costs, with C$1,250 per adult and C$500 per dependent, expected to cost about C$100 million.After the scare of her life escaping the fire on Tuesday, housekeeping supervisor Susie Demelo got some welcome good news on Saturday. New satellite images showed the house she rents in Fort McMurray was still standing.Demelo and her partner had no insurance on their belongings.""I'm very blessed and grateful,"" she said. ""And nobody has died in the fire.""Through Friday and Saturday, police escorted thousands of evacuees who had been forced to flee north from Fort McMurray back through the burning town, to allow them to head south to Alberta's major cities. By Sunday morning, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman said that process was complete.Some residents were complaining about the lack of news from the town, fire chief Darby Allen said in a video posted online late on Saturday.""We know from all the calls that you're getting frustrated because you don't have any information on your homes. We're really working hard on that, it's a complicated process,"" he said.More than 500 firefighters were in and around Fort McMurray, along with 15 helicopters, 14 air tankers and 88 other pieces of equipment, officials said.(Additional reporting by Ethan Lou, Allison Martell and David Ljunggren; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Digby Lidstone and Alan Crosby)"

It’s one reason that Sanders keeps performing well in primaries and caucuses, prolonging the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.But whether that assessment of Clinton is accurate depends entirely on what it means to be a true progressive nowadays.Does it mean voting like Sanders has, and embracing his agenda? Or does it simply mean consistently pushing for policies that would significantly advance progressive causes, like a fairer economy and a cleaner environment?By the first definition, Clinton clearly doesn’t qualify as a progressive. By the second, she clearly does.The ideological gulf between Sanders and Clinton is real, and it's easy to spot. Sanders thinks everybody should get health insurance from the government and be able to attend public universities for free. He thinks taxes must go up to pay for these programs, mostly on the rich but also on the middle class. Clinton has rejected those ideas as impractical, as policy or politics -- or simply ill-conceived.Their histories are different too. Over the years, Sanders staked out a position so far to the political left that, until this year, he didn’t even formally identify as a member of the Democratic Party -- and preferred to call himself simply a “democratic socialist.” He was an original critic of the North American Free Trade Agreement. He gets his campaign funding almost exclusively from small donors, and has basically no ties to corporate America.Clinton, by contrast, has on occasion called herself “moderate.” She has the support of all kinds of wealthy and corporate donors, and she may soon have more. Just this week, Politico reported that some of her fundraisers were courting traditionally Republican campaign financiers on Wall Street. Statistics designed to measure ideological temperament, like the DW-NOMINATE scores by political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, suggest that Sanders has been among the most liberal members of the Senate. This includes the era when he and Clinton served in the Senate together. Their ratings aren’t particularly close.But Sanders’ position on the outer ideological edges of the Democratic Party is also a reminder that context matters.If Sanders is the standard by which you’re going to decide whether a politician is a progressive, then almost nobody from the Democratic Party would qualify. Take Sanders out of the equation, and suddenly Clinton looks an awful lot like a mainstream progressive -- firmly on the left side of the American ideological spectrum and maybe on the left side of the Democratic Party’s, as well.One reason it’s easy to miss this is that Clinton’s domestic policy agenda doesn’t include one signature idea or position that’s going to dominate the headlines or get activists excited. Instead, it’s a series of proposals that, together, would fortify the social safety net, strengthen regulation of industry, and bolster public services. To the extent these programs require new spending, the money would largely come from new taxes on the wealthy.Consider just a few key components of Clinton’s economic and energy agenda:Minimum Wage: Clinton has formally proposed raising it to $12 everywhere, with the possibility of $15 in communities where living standards are already high. (She’s since said that she would sign a bill mandating a $15 wage across the country, with unspecified caveats.) It’s not quite as ambitious as what Sanders has in mind, but it’s close. Relative to today’s minimum wage, the level that Clinton proposes would represent an increase of about two-thirds, which would make it the largest jump in the history of the federal minimum wage. Note that Clinton would also index the minimum wage to the median wage, as Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) has proposed, so that it maintained its value over time -- and that Clinton would eliminate the “tipped” minimum wage, which allows restaurants to pay food servers less on the theory that the workers will make up the difference in tips.Climate Change: Clinton has said she opposes Arctic drilling, as well as oil and gas development off the Atlantic coast. (The Obama administration has since taken a similar position on the Atlantic.) Clinton has also said she would phase out fossil fuel development on public lands. She hasn’t rejected fracking outright, as Sanders has, but she’s taken increasingly tough positions on natural gas.By 2027, Clinton has said, 33 percent of electricity should come from renewable sources. That’s short of what climate scientists believe is necessary to get a handle on global warming, but it’s also more ambitious than Obama’s goal, which is 28 percent renewables by 2030.Paid Family Leave: Clinton, a longtime proponent for supporting working parents, has called for providing 12 weeks of paid leave for new mothers and fathers, as well as anybody taking care of an infirmed elderly relative. She would require this of all states, rather than simply putting up some money for states interested in experimenting. And she’d back that with enough federal funding to cover at least two-thirds of the cost in each state.Unlike Sanders, who would finance his version of paid family leave with a small tax on all payrolls, Clinton has said she would probably rely on taxes for the wealthy or taxes on business. But the benefits would be the same.Higher education: If Clinton has her way, students could pay for tuition at public four-year colleges in their states without taking out loans. The program to make this possible would be complicated, even convoluted: States would get money from the the federal government, on the condition they stop reducing and start increasing what they spend on higher education. In addition, students would have to work up to 10 hours a week, while families would have to make a “realistic contribution” -- conditions that Sanders would not place on aid. But low-income students could use aid to pay for books and fees, as well as tuition. (Other living expenses, notably room and board, would still require payment or loans for most students.) Community college would be free, which is a big deal, since that’s where 38 percent of undergraduates are getting their educations. All told, the Clinton program would require $350 billion over 10 years, which is less than Sanders has proposed, but far more than Obama suggested in either of his presidential campaigns.Taxes: Clinton has proposed a raft of new taxes that would fall almost entirely on wealthy individuals or corporations. Her agenda includes higher estate taxes and a minimum tax on incomes higher than $1 million, which has come to be known as the “Buffett Rule.” (It’s after Warren Buffett, the multibillionaire who publicized the loopholes allowing people like to him to pay lower income tax rates than their office staff.) Clinton would close the loophole that lets some investment fund managers get a huge tax break on most of their incomes. She would also make it more difficult for corporations to avoid taxes overseas.The Brookings-Urban Tax Policy Center estimates that Clinton’s tax proposals would generate more than $1 trillion in revenue over 10 years. That’s a lot of money, even if it pales next to the new taxes that Sanders would seek. (Estimates have suggested his tax hikes would be more than $10 trillion and maybe more like $20 trillion, though the majority of that would be in the form of health insurance taxes displacing current taxes and private health insurance premiums.)Note that this partial list leaves out whole categories of policies -- like immigration, gun violence, and abortion rights -- where Clinton also has staked out strongly progressive positions. In some cases, her positions are arguably more progressive than the ones Sanders has taken. (The list also does not include foreign policy, where Clinton’s interventionist instincts put her at odds with many progressives -- but where, as Max Fisher of Vox has noted, Clinton’s enthusiasm for diplomacy sets her apart from conservatives.)Of course, sketching out a campaign agenda is one thing. Pushing to enact it is quite another. A big reason that Sanders and his supporters don’t put much stock in Clinton’s rhetoric is that they don’t trust her to follow through. They think she will pull back, because they see her raising money from corporate interests that oppose progressive policies -- and because they remember the 1990s, when she supported welfare reform, free trade treaties, and other policies that her husband pursued when he was president. But Clinton's responsibility for her husband's agenda isn't always self-evident, because, as first lady, she had less ability to dissent than other advisers. A better indicator of her instincts is probably her subsequent record as a senator from New York. According to those same DW-NOMINATE ratings, Clinton was the chamber's 11th most-liberal member during her tenure. It's a crude statistic, but it suggests strongly that she was not just progressive relative to the Senate. It suggests that she was also progressive relative to members of her own party.And if you can count on Clinton to be responsive to Wall Street, you can also count on her to be responsive to unions, environmental groups, advocates for children and for women’s rights -- groups that will continue to push her in a progressive direction if she ends up in the White House. The same goes for the hordes of progressive voters who have backed Sanders in the primaries. If they make noise, Clinton is going to listen.That's arguably happening already, thanks to the strong campaign that Sanders has run. This is how political change happens! But once the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination is over, the dynamics are bound to shift. It's easy to forget now, but the right wing has spent most of Clinton's time in public life portraying her as a extreme liberal, or even a socialist. As soon as the primaries are over, those attacks will start again -- and some ambivalent progressives may decide they like Clinton after all."

In March, researchers were only able to identify three addaxes in the region the animals are known to inhabit. They characterized the animals as seeming ""very nervous.""""We are witnessing in real time the extinction of this iconic and once plentiful species,” Dr. Jean-Christophe Vie of the IUCN Global Species Programme said in a news release.The social animals used to live in herds of five to 20, though sometimes these smaller herds would band together with others to form groups of hundreds moving across the desert. They adapted to harsh desert conditions, producing highly concentrated urine to conserve water.Niger has outlawed hunting the addax, and the animals are protected in Chad under U.N. environmental legislation. But oil extraction in the Niger desert by the China National Petroleum Corporation has been disastrous for the addaxes' habitat, destroying many of the areas where the creatures graze on shrubs and other vegetation, according to the IUCN. Additionally, soldiers guarding the oil operation have been known to poach the animals for meat.It’s possible that the researchers missed some animals while taking their survey. But even if the real population is five times what they counted, that’s still too small for the species to sustain itself, according to science news site Phys.org.That means the only way to save the wild population would be to introduce animals that have been bred in captivity. But doing so is expensive and extra challenging when there are so few of them in the wild already, the IUCN’s Alessandro Badalotti told Phys.org. It’s also a pointless endeavor if the threats to the animals in the wild aren’t mitigated.In a bizarre twist, people can legally hunt captive-bred addaxes in the United States."

Such a candidacy would be a mistake for two major reasons.,2016-05-08,"Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney meets with attendees at a Republican presidential candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich campaign stop on Monday, March 14, 2016, at Westerville Central High School in Westerville, Ohio.

Such a candidacy would be a mistake for two major reasons: First, the political figures leading this effort are simply wrong for America. And, second, given the Republican Party's evident fragility, a third-party candidacy at this particular moment will quite possibly leave it irretrievably broken.Before I go further, however, I want to stipulate to certain facts: Donald Trump is manifestly unfit to serve as President of the United States. His racist pandering, his xenophobic calls for the deportation of undocumented aliens, and his proposals to exclude all members of a great world religion from entry into the United States are among the worst positions taken by a major presidential contender, ever.The two men most often mentioned in connection with a nascent third-party candidacy are Mitt Romney and Bill Kristol. They are not the answers the United States is looking for. Their public careers suggest that they should not be elevated to positions of authority and influence.Let's take Mitt Romney first. Read the following words and dwell on them. This is Mitt Romney's denunciation of the ""47 percent"" of vulnerable Americans who require some form of federal assistance to lead a decent life: ""There are 47 percent . . . who are dependent on the government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.""Who are the ""47 percent"" Mitt Romney so callously dismissed? They are Social Security recipients who worked hard all their lives and now subsist on a fixed income and depend on Medicare for their health care. They are the working poor who labor and sweat long hours and require government subsidized health insurance. They are the parents of special-needs children. They are the disabled, many of them veterans, who cannot work.Do you detect a sneer in Romney's voice? Contempt perhaps? I certainly do. In November, 2015, Donald Trump horrifically mocked New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski for his disability. Trump has rightfully been taken to task for his inappropriate conduct.But how is Romney's condescension to the less fortunate any different from Trump's cruel pantomime? It is cooler perhaps, more abstract and cerebral. The targets of the attack go unnamed. Romney doesn't seem to know anyone in the 47 percent, but he stereotypes them as, what exactly? Lazy? Indifferent? Tell me again, who is worse? There is no one who better bears the title ""Mr. One Percent"" more fittingly than Mitt Romney.We live in an America that, since the New Deal, has made a commitment to provide for the vulnerable. The New Deal was a promise binding government and citizens that the State would serve as final guarantor of the common good. It is about time that men like Mitt Romney make peace with that social contract.Nor is this all. Mitt Romney introduced a term into the American political lexicon that should rightly haunt him for the rest of his public life -- ""self-deportation."" In January, 2012, he explained that this was his solution to undocumented immigrants in the United States. He promised that he would introduce a tracking system that would prevent the undocumented from working in the United States and so force them ""to self-deport to a place where they can get work.""Mitt Romney will always be remembered for two things: his condescending attack on the 47 percent and his popularization of the term ""self-deportation.""What about Bill Kristol? In 2002 and 2003, there was probably no more enthusiastic cheerleader for George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq than Kristol. On September 18, 2002, he predicted that Bush's impending invasion ""could have terrifically good effects throughout the Middle East."" On November 21, 2002, he wrote that the prospective invasion ""would start a chain reaction in the Arab world that would be very healthy.""Kristol, as events proved, was horrifically, tragically wrong in his predictions. Over 4,000 Americans died in the invasion and occupation, and many thousands more were wounded. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have died. Has Kristol ever apologized? Does he feel any remorse? I can find no record of it.And while it is not on the same level as the Iraq fiasco, we must also remember Bill Kristol as the individual responsible for introducing Sarah Palin to the American public. She was an obscure Alaska governor, not quite half-way through her first term when Kristol recommended to John McCain that he select her as his running mate. The rest, as they say, is history.These are the two men who are said to be most deeply involved in planning for a possible third-party candidacy. They should not do it. Romney is an unsuitable candidate radically out of step with America, and Bill Kristol is a deeply flawed strategist. Just as importantly, however, a third-party candidacy at this moment in time might deal an irreparable blow to the Republican Party.One would have to look to nineteenth-century examples to find a political party as fragile as today's Republican Party. One can identify three or four distinct sub-groupings within the Party that really have little in common with each other. There is the business roundtable wing, which was most closely associated with Jeb Bush in the just-concluded GOP primary. Mitt Romney is closely associated with this wing of the Party. They have money, they occupy positions of power and prestige, but they command little in the way of voter affection or allegiance.Then there are the ethno-nationalists, who are most closely associated with Donald Trump. They are hostile to immigration and suspicious of foreign interventions. They are, many of them, the heirs and descendants of the Reagan Democrats of the 1980's, men and women who transitioned from the Democratic to the Republican Parties for cultural and racial reasons. In this election cycle, at least, they have the most energy, even if that energy is funneled into support for the odious Donald Trump.Third, there are the true-believing religious conservatives. These are men and women who entered politics as an outgrowth of their high religious principles. These were the voters who remained with Ted Cruz to the bitter end and see compromise on moral issues as something akin to surrender or betrayal.Finally, one might (or might not) see as a separate group the military interventionists. This grouping consists of Senators like John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and the many defense contractors who depend on an active military. If the primary vote for Lindsey Graham means anything, it suggests that this group has little support outside the Beltway.A third-party candidacy at this point could explode this brittle amalgamation into its various component parts. It is anyone's guess whether it can ever be put back together.The better course to follow is that taken by Nelson Rockefeller in 1964. Barry Goldwater, the Republican nominee that year, had voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and openly courted southern segregationists like Strom Thurmond. Like Donald Trump today, Goldwater made himself unacceptable to large segments of the voting public. Rockefeller refused to endorse Goldwater and abstained.That is the course of action I would recommend today. Do nothing to show your support. Repeatedly and publicly explain why Donald Trump is unacceptable. Quietly vote for the Democratic nominee or just abstain from voting. And stand ready to pick up the pieces after November."

It's largely something we take for granted and all too often catch ourselves complaining about, fervently.For some people, like my friend who's also a Domestic Helper, Lara*, it's simply not an option to have her little girl living with her, permanently.You see, Lara hails from the Philippines and in her quest to guarantee that her four year old has a future where she can be educated, clothed and fed with adequate healthcare, she chooses to make a separate life in Hong Kong, without her daughter, indefinitely.As a Domestic Helper, Lara knows that being a cleaner, cook and nanny for someone else's family means earning far more than she could ever possibly earn back home using her degree in Business Management.The Philippines is an impoverished country with a population stretching towards the 100-million mark -- one third live below the poverty line.It's a country that tends to fly under the radar -- that is until tragedy strikes... and it does, often.Situated smack bang on the Ring of Fire, the archipelago of 7000 islands is frequently caught in the firing line of typhoons and earthquakes.

Headlines of destruction and despair alert the world to the plight of this nation -- a nation that seems stuck in a time warp, unable to move forward from the grip of corruption that has plagued it for decades. But this is also a resilient country with equally resilient people, renowned for picking themselves up again and again... and that alone gives you faith in the Philippines' future.It's this resoluteness that has seen the nation's women become the backbone of the economy. Since the early seventies the female proportion of the population has had its path mapped out -- mostly off shore.It was 1974 when the then President of the Philippines implemented the first labour exporting policy in the form of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW's).A way to combat rising unemployment, OFW's brought an added bonus in financing the government's coffers with overseas workers' remittances (which today are worth a staggering US$20 billion).The OFW trend coincided with the economic rise of nearby countries like Hong Kong and Singapore.A labour shortage in Hong Kong meant the female labour force was mobilized and families with two incomes sought help to manage their household, in turn creating considerable demand for domestic helpers. Today, not much has changed. There's still a labour shortage and Hong Kong has become a 'Maid Economy' relying heavily on the mass exodus of women from the Philippines and Indonesia to fill these positions, freeing up professionals to work long hours and pump up the country's gross domestic product.Still it's not enough to plug the acute shortage -- last year the first group of maids from Bangladesh arrived in the city. Agencies hoping the country will provide a rich source of women willing to work in a foreign country for US$505 a month. To apply for a Domestic Helper position in Hong Kong, these women pay three times that monthly salary and spend three months in training, learning, among other things, to speak basic Cantonese and cook Chinese food.Ten million Filipinos are currently working overseas with nearly a million leaving each year to work with employment programs. Most of them are women, propping up the economy, by sending 80-90 per cent of their salary home each month to care for less able family members and children - in the hope of providing them with a better life ahead, a chance to break out of the mould.Many of them are skilled workers like Lara, taking on unskilled work -- meaning countries like the Philippines are becoming victim to what's touted as 'brain drain.'But trained workers are not all they're losing.Children in the Philippines are being called the 'motherless generation.'A UNICEF-commissioned study estimates that roughly one in four children in the Philippines have at least one parent working abroad.More and more, that means a mother living halfway around the world for 10 or 15 years at a time.The government (rightly so) applauds OFWs as heroes for the sacrifices they make for their families.But while children whose mothers are nurses in Canada or housekeepers in Hong Kong often go to good schools and have the latest gadgets, there's a growing sentiment that trading global dollars for a generation 'raised on Skype' is a raw deal.The Philippines has a young population with over 35 per cent of the nation 14 years old or younger and that's on track to double between 2000 and 2030, sending tens of millions more into a limited workforce.While the Philippines economy is growing and confidence is at an all time high, these kids see few opportunities at home.
