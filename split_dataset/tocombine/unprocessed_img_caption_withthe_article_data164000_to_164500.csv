A dramatic shift is beginning in the disappointing struggle to find something to slow the damage of Alzheimer's disease: The first U.S. experiments with ""brain pacemakers"" for Alzheimer's are getting under way. Scientists are looking beyond drugs to implants in the hunt for much-needed new treatments. (AP Photo/Merck & Co., File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ccbbb2100003100c5446f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jessica FirgerA new study projects there will be 13.8 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease by 2050, up from 4.7 million in 2010. The study, published in the journal Neurology, indicates an outsized need to boost research efforts, develop innovative treatments, increase the caregiver workforce, and move toward finding a cure for the disease.The risk for developing Alzheimer's disease increases as a person ages. And the anticipated ballooning of the number of people with Alzheimer's is due to increasing lifespans, and a sizable, aging baby boomer population of 78 million -- 28 percent of the U.S. total -- who are expected to live well past previous generations.More from Everyday Health: Too Much Light: Ruining Not Just Your Sleep But Your Health Too The Special Diabetes Program and a Cure for Diabetes Mentally Ill Smoke 30 Percent of All CigarettesCurrently, 1 in 8 Americans over the age of 65 has Alzheimer's disease, which is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Symptoms include inability to recognize people or objects, and difficulty with motor skills and speech.According to the authors of the Neurology study, in 2010, there were 0.7 million people with Alzheimer's between 65 and 74 years old, 2.3 million between 75 to 84, and 1.8 million 85 and older. Among the estimated 13.8 million Alzheimer's patients in 2050, approximately half will be 85 or older, say the researchers.The research team analyzed data from 1993 to 2011 on 10,802 African Americans and whites in Chicago who were 65 and older. They interviewed subjects every three years to screen for dementia, and then combined that information with U.S. Census Bureau death rate data and projected death rates.""Without having these numbers we generated, it's like knowing a hurricane is coming but not knowing what category it's going to be in,"" says Jennifer Weave, ScD, assistant professor at the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging in Chicago and co-author of the study. ""Its kind of like climate change. Until it stares you right in the face, it's hard to really comprehend the magnitude of the problem.""Parsing and predicting these numbers wasn't an easy task, says Weave. The U.S. government does not keep count of the number of people with Alzheimer's like it does with diseases such as cancer or HIV. ""Some research suggests that half of the people who have Alzheimer's don't know they have it,"" she says.More Alzheimer's, Less Access to CareIn the 20th century, life expectancy increased steadily because of many factors, such as better medical treatment, vaccines, improved nutrition, and cleaner water, among others. In the year 1900, a typical American's average life expectancy was 49.2 years. By 1950, that number had increased to 68.1 years, and by 1975, to around 74, according to the National Centers for Health Statistics. In the past decade that number has risen to almost 78 years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). These figures alone speak volumes about just how overwhelmed our health care system may be in the coming decades.Alzheimer's disease can be active for a decade or more, and as the disease progresses, a patient requires around-the-clock care, whether at home or in an assisted living or nursing home facility. Both routes for care tax not just a patient, but also their loved ones, explains Lou-Ellen Barkan, president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Association's New York City chapter. ""People who become ill live a long time with the disease,"" says Barkan. ""Most people cannot afford the kind of care we're talking about.""Alzheimer's is an incredibly costly disease. In 2012, the country spent $200 billion on Alzheimer's, according to a recent report from the Alzheimer's Association. As the United States works to reshape its health care system -- expanding Medicaid and scaling down Medicare -- the situation becomes more dire, she says. ""This is going to bankrupt the system. We need to look at how money is being spent,"" she says.""We do not have enough nursing homes, we do not have enough nursing home beds, and we don't have enough people trained in care at these nursing homes.""In New York alone, experts predict that 1 out of 5 people will have Alzheimer's or be caring for someone with the disease within the next few decades, says Barkan. ""I look around and I wonder where is everyone going to go? The real question is how will government pay for that care? That will play itself out in the next 5 to 10 years,"" she says.Better Treatment and Preventive Care: Enough to Help an Epidemic?In recent years, scientists have developed newer treatments for Alzheimer's, but there is no cure in sight. There are several medications on the market that work by stopping the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is believed to be important for cognition and memory. Drugs in this class include Aricept, Exelon, and Razadyne. Some recent research has looked into developing an Alzheimer's vaccine to prevent the disease.Some medical experts who work closely with the aging population say it's essential to encourage preventive care. Zachary Palace, MD, a geriatrician and director of the Hebrew Home, a nursing home in Riverdale, N.Y., says he observes that residents who work to keep their brains sharp and stay busy by doing activities such as playing crossword puzzles, socializing, and staying physically active, tend to fare better and are less likely to develop dementia. ""I think we need more emphasis on what we do know,"" says Dr. Palace.Last year, President Barack Obama signed a bill that outlines a national fight against Alzheimer's disease initiative to develop effective treatments for the disease and related forms of dementia by the year 2025. Two trials underway at the National Institutes of Health, funded through Obama's plan, have shown promise. One is for an insulin nasal spray treatment, and the other is a large scale prevention trial involving people at high-risk for developing the disease.""Research can also tell us which ways of managing Alzheimer's is most effective for caregivers,"" says Weave. ""It's possible we won't figure out how to cure Alzheimer, but we may figure out how to manage it.""""U.S. Alzheimer's Population Will Triple by 2050"" originally appeared on Everyday Health."
1,WELLNESS,Chris Christie's Weight: Can You Be Obese And Healthy?,Meredith Melnick,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-weight-obese-health_us_5b9ccb31e4b03a1dcc81eaf0,"Despite his bluster and understandable dismay that a doctor who hasn't examined him would speculate about his health, it",2013-02-07,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie listens to a question as he announces his ""Hurricane Sandy Flood Map Regulations"" Thursday, Jan. 24, 2013, in Seaside Heights, N.J. The town, which was featured in the MTV reality show ""Jersey Shore"" sustained substantial damage to homes and its boardwalk during Superstorm Sandy. (AP Photo/Mel Evans)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ccb31240000500094d2df.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When former White House physician Dr. Connie Mariano expressed concern that Chris Christie's weight may make him unfit for office and could be a deciding factor in his potential presidential candidacy in 2016, the New Jersey Governor came out swinging. During an interview with CNN, Mariano said that Christie could suffer a heart attack or stroke during his tenure. ""I'm worried about this man dying in office,"" she said. His response? Take a family history. According to an AP and HuffPost report, Christie told the doctor to ""shut up"" unless she had personally examined him and learned about his family history of heart risk. Undeterred, Mariano responded (via an interview with Bloomberg), saying that ""you don't have to be a doctor to see that he is obese.""Who is right? And is it possible to be healthy and obese? As Christie said on The Late Show with David Letterman, ""I'm basically the healthiest fat guy you've ever seen in your life.""""Obesity leads to an increase risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol. Those are risk factors for heart disease, but so is smoking and family history,"" Dr. Robert Michler, chairman of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center, told HuffPost. ""Hundreds of thousands of people who are obese reach old age and even die without having a heart attack or stroke.""It's an important distinction: Obesity is not a condition that causes heart attacks directly. Instead, it increases the risk of developing chronic conditions like major heart disease, high cholesterol and hypertension and those, in turn, often result in heart attack and stroke. Does the obese Christie, 50, have a higher chance of developing one of these conditions and of subsequently dying of a cardiac event? Yes. But that doesn't mean he will. According to New York University's Langone Weight Management Center, about 300,000 Americans die each year from obesity-related complications, though 35.7 percent of the U.S. population is obese (about 112 million people), according to the latest estimates from the CDC. And, as a recent study in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found, obesity in and of itself is not a good predictor of health status. They found that during a six year period, obese study participants were no more likely to die than their healthy-weight counterparts if they didn't have one of the chronic diseases associated with obesity, like Type 2 diabetes or hypertension. Early death may not be the primary outcome of obesity, but illness abounds. Obesity is associated with heart failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, sleep apnea and other respiratory problems, and even some cancers. It also exacerbates other conditions, like asthma, for which Christie has previously been hospitalized. Although we don't know the governor's BMI or weight information, it is relevant to his overall heart attack risk. According to NYU Langone, an obese person has an average of six times the heart disease risk as a non-obese person. And that risk increases depending on how obese you are. In the Framingham Heart Study, a famous, longitudinal study of overall cardiac risk, researchers found that for every increment increase in an adult man's BMI, there was an associated five percent increased risk of heart failure. What's interesting is that obese heart failure patients have better outcomes and are less likely to die than heart failure patients with a healthy weight -- something that doctors refer to as the ""heart failure paradox,"" explains Michler.Stroke risk, which Mariano also expressed concern about, increases with BMI, as well: for every increment increase of BMI, the risk of ischemic stroke goes up four percent and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke increases six percent. Despite his bluster and understandable dismay that a doctor who hasn't examined him would speculate about his health, it seems as though the risks of remaining so profoundly overweight have begun to sink in. ""I have been remarkably healthy,"" Christie told Letterman. ""My doctor continues to warn me my luck is going to run out relatively soon. So, believe me, it is something that I am very conscious of."""

That's exactly why we've been reaching out to the savviest cleaning and organizing experts to learn where to begin with these tasks and get a fresh start at home.  The best way to stay on track with cleaning and organizing projects is to start with an area that you can get in order in one sitting. This way when you're done, you'll feel accomplished and motivated to tackle another mess later on. Jenn Lifford, expert blogger behind Clean & Scentsible, suggests beginning with your home's unique hot spots. For many, she told us, the kitchen counters and work surfaces tend to be the most troublesome areas, as this room is usually the heart of the home and abuzz with activity. That's why Lifford recommends designing what she calls a ""kitchen command center."" This zone could be situated at a desk, a pull-up cart or even a small corner of the countertop, as long as you have space to organize incoming and outgoing mail, family paperwork, bills and coupons. Lifford likes to use  wall-mounted file organizers  and  and storage with shallow drawers for paper  that she labels accordingly. She then suggests spending about fifteen minutes each week going through accumulated papers and putting them in the proper receptacle -- either in your file storage, a nearby trash bin or recycling. Also, it's best to keep a paper shredder at hand for documents with personal information. Lifford says spending a designated amount of time cleaning up regularly, whether it's fifteen minutes or thirty, will surprisingly make these tasks become routine very quickly.  Illustration by Raydene Salinas Lifford's other tips for getting organized at home: Create a ""dumping area:"" Sounds messy, but having a spot to stash your keys, change and purse right near your home's main entrance will save you time and energy. Cut back on junk-mail: Opting out of unsolicited mail by visiting the Direct Marketing Association's website will cut down on unnecessary paper clutter.

I don't care what people say -- having sex is not at all like riding a bike. Sure, you thought you knew how to do it once upon a time, but after you've been out of the game with a husband and celibacy for a while, you have a whole lot to learn. After all, your life is different, your body is different, and you are a whole new person.  The good news is this: Post-divorce sex can be the best sex of your life. You're older, wiser and you just don't care what other people think. Plus, you are now kinder with yourself and have the capacity to be gentler with another person. And you're ripe for some fun.  But be prepared. Consider this list of 10 things that only happen to single moms during sex.  Disclaimer: All or some or none of the following may or may not have happened to me or women I know or met or heard of. You know who you are.  1. Late-night phone sex is interrupted by your kid barfing.2. You discover at an inopportune moment that you have 27 ""My Little Pony"" stickers attached to your legs.3. You discover at an inopportune moment that even though you stopped nursing a year ago, you are indeed still lactating.4. You grab what you think is a pen from your purse to write your number on his hand, only to find yourself gripping a GI Joe.5. You dig into the nightstand drawer for a condom, only to have to sort through LEGOs and crayons and Barbie accessories to find them wedged in the far back corner.6. Just as things are getting frisky, you get a text from your ex because your kid is freaking out and misses you and will you please call and calm him down? Like, now?!7. Somehow a ""Wiggles"" song makes its way onto your ""Smooth Jamz"" playlist.8. You leave the party to fool around in the car, but there are car seats in the backseat. And Cheerios in the other seats. And the car kinda smells like toddler pee. And maybe something rotting under the seat? Man, how long has this banana been under here? Let's just forget it, OK? It was nice to meet you, too.9. You're with someone new and you have to face the fact that your business is just not what it used to be. Either you have a scar above (or hidden by?) your furry bits, or your junk has been sewn up like a cross-stitch sampler, or things just aren't the same downtown.10. Despite it all, you can still stand naked in front of a man who will say (and mean it), ""You have a beautiful body."""

But the former Miss USA, who attended Boston University before leaving for the pageant circuit, seems ambivalent about her new role, which includes shilling for an energy drink and a Miss Universe-branded fragrance. In a new video interview with the Wall Street Journal, 20-year-old Culpo hints that the title ""Miss Universe"" might be a tad hyperbolic [emphasis ours]:""... and that's what won it for me, and maybe a little bit of luck. I like to say luck because I don't want to think that I'm 'The Miss Universe.' I just think the title alone is... you've get to get lucky to get a title like that. What does that even mean? Do I control the world? I don't know.""Thank you to someone for finally pointing this out. ""Universe"" is a bit of an exaggeration, seeing as we don't know what sorts of pageants they're currently staging out in the cosmos. Perhaps ""Miss Earth"" would be more accurate, or simply ""Miss Donald Trump.""We rather like this sassy side of Miss Universe -- we bet she'd get along well with our Brooklyn homegirl, Miss America.Watch the rest of Culpo's candid chat in the video below.
