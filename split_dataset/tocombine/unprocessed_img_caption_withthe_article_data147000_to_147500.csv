The conference features discussions, case studies and lectures and brings together an extraordinary group of international high-profile speakers and more than 500 participants from business, media, technology, society, health, education, politics and science.

He credits the proliferation of new technologies, such as the ""autocorrect"" feature on mobile phones, for phasing out such curricula. “Firstly, my phone corrects my spelling so I don’t really need to think about it and, secondly, because I often skip grammar and write in a cryptic way,” Mitra told the magazine last week. He added, “My entire background tells me, ‘No, no, it is really bad what you are saying,' but I think there is a change and we have to learn to live with it.""Mitra, a professor of educational technology at Newcastle University in the U.K., is well known for his “Hole in the Wall” experiment, in which he installed a computer into the wall of a poor Indian slum to see who would be most attracted to the machine. He found that curious children were the most frequent users of the computer, and that they eventually taught themselves how to surf the Internet.It appears, however, that the professor’s ideas about spelling and grammar have not elicited positive responses. On Saturday he tweeted: His remarks come only a few months after England’s education ministers introduced a new, nationally required spelling and grammar test for students. Education minister Elizabeth Truss told The Guardian that the test is designed to help ensure that kids can communicate effectively.""That is why employers bemoan the poor literacy of so many school and college leavers,"" she said. ""This new test will mean that children are again taught the skills they need to understand our language, and to use it properly, creatively and effectively."""

As we reflect back on the frenzy that was last week, we are reminded of all the excitement the royal family has created over the past several years. From weddings to babies, we can't help but wonder about the tangible effect of royal events on the lives of everyday people -- specifically wedding style and economics.It began with a dress -- effects on consumer styleSince Queen Victoria kick started the trend of white wedding gowns, the global bridalwear industry has grown to what will be a $56 billion industry by 2015, according to a report by Global Industry Analysts. Keeping up with tradition, Kate's lovely wedding gown tipped the trend for lace -- both for weddings and everyday fashion. According to Drapers, Alexander McQueen is riding on the royal train after the wedding. The fashion house of Kate's wedding dress saw a strong growth in 2011, with operating profit increasing by 33 percent by the end of the year compared to the preceding 12 months. Beyond bridal fashion, the royal wedding also renewed interest in sapphire engagement rings (Kate's was Diana's ring from Prince Charles), strengthened the ""Kate effect"" that increases the sales of any brand the duchess wears, and yes, even launched Pippa Middleton's event planning career. It's more than just a party -- effects on economyAnd now with Prince George's arrival, Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research (CRR), told Reuters that he estimates more than 240 MM pounds could be added to the British economy. Most of the spending will go to souvenir sales, and the rest will go to celebration spend and tourism.And even bookies are getting a boost. According to Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, it is Christmas in July for bookies, as people were betting on the gender of the baby and its name.But not all royal celebration is a boon. According to Archer, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012 and the Royal Wedding in 2011 resulted in a net economic loss. The holiday from both events hit output and services activity, as well as limited retail sales on the day in question. ""While some of this lost economic activity was subsequently made up, there was undoubtedly a significant overall loss from this factor,"" said Archer as reported by the Financial Times. We'd also like to point out that unless the spending is a net addition, and not a shift in spending elsewhere, the only people who benefit are the retailers and business directly involved in royalty-inspired sales. Big pictureWhile fans of the royal family would like to believe their monarchs impact the overall economy and even birth rate, there hasn't been any study to conclusively prove that royal weddings and births have significant economic impact. Fortunately, this does not really take away the optimism people feel on these joyous occasions and the happiness these bring them, even if their enthusiasm results in purchases of royal condoms and creepy wedding dolls!"

The trick: blanching the basil before making the pesto.You may think that blanching the basil will take away some of its spunk, but be assured that it doesn't. Indeed, the technique won't take an ounce of flavor out of the aromatic leaves.This extra step only adds a few minutes to the preparation of your pesto, but it'll give you a bright green sauce that will make all your favorite pesto dishes look as good as they taste.Basil Pesto - One That Will Stay Bright Green!Makes 1 cup Active time: 20 min2 teaspoons sea salt for blanching 1 large bunch fresh basil (4 oz) (115 g) - leaves removed from stems (3 cups lightly packed) 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1/3 cup freshly grated Reggiano or Grana Padano Parmesan 1 large garlic clove - skinned 3 tablespoons pine nuts 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oilStep 1: Fill a large bowl with cold water and several ice cubes. Set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a fast boil. Add the salt and basil leaves and blanch for 15 seconds only. Immediately remove the leaves from the boiling water and place in the ice water bath. Once cooled (this only takes a few seconds), drain. Squeeze the leaves to remove all excess water and lay them on a paper towel.Step 2: Using scissors, cut the basil in 1″ pieces.
