How do you they lead their people well and subsequently bring about change on a global scale? Andy Hargreaves, Alan Boyle and Alma Harris conducted an extensive seven-year global research study that focused on fifteen high-performing organizations in business, sports and education to find out the answers to these questions.Prepare to be inspired by their extensive research and their conclusions, which are the subject of Uplifting Leadership: How Organizations, Teams and Communities Raise Performance, a new book that Sir Ken Robinson predicts will ""overturn many conventional assumptions about leadership."" It's a book I couldn't put down and consider it essential reading for those who think that effective leadership is fundamental to solving our global, national and local challenges. What lessons can we learn from this book and what do respected leaders from the worlds of politics, education and business believe about great leadership in our evolving 21st century world? I invited Esko Aho (former Finnish Prime Minister), Jeff Beard (Founder and Chairman of Global Study Pass and former Director General of the International Baccalaureate Organization), Michael Fullan (Canadian educational researcher, author and former Dean of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education), and Frances Strickland (former First Lady of Ohio and American educator) to share their perspectives.What are the 21st century skills essential for future leaders?Jeff Beard: I've spoken for some time about the trends I was observing in international education and how more students, particularly in the East, were searching for study abroad opportunities in the West so they could get a ""leg up"" in the competition for places with the best universities and employers. Increasingly, both are saying that they seek young people exhibiting both 21st century and global citizenship skills.While there are many definitions out there regarding 21st century skills, I guess I identify most with the Assessment & Teaching of 21st-Century Skills definition, which was based on some pretty solid research. It emphasizes learning and innovation skills that deal with ways of thinking and working (i.e. creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving, decision-making coupled with communication & collaboration skills); tools for working (i.e. information & communications technology and information literacy); and skills for living in today's world (global citizenship and lifelong learning, since many of the career fields for today's young people haven't yet been invented).For our schools, this will not be a matter of putting more emphasis on the core curriculum. Creativity, ingenuity, and innovation are the keys to success in today's global economy. To prepare young people for work and life in the 21st century, our teachers must also cultivate students' creativity. ""An education reform leader must have a strong desire to raise the bar and close the gap for all students, with the knowledge and commitment that he has to build ownership with administrators and teachers to do this."" - Michael FullanIf you were selecting an education reform leader for any country, what attributes and skills would you be looking for in him/her?Michael Fullan: 1. An education reform leader must have a strong desire to raise the bar and close the gap for all students, with the knowledge and commitment that he has to build ownership with administrators and teachers to do this. 2. The capacity to build a cohesive central team that works together to embrace and implement point 1.  3. A commitment to working with businesses, parents and community groups to understand and support the agenda. 4. A developmental mind set for capacity building strategies, including teacher appraisal, instructional development, and the student achievement agenda.  5. A commitment to measuring and furthering student progress, including a capacity to understand and use data.What will 21st century leaders need to understand about the short and long term issues in regard to managing technology?Esko Aho: There are some obvious obstacles to digitization and many of them are connected with leadership.New digital solutions cannot be created without risk. That's why venture funding for digital businesses is critical. In addition to money, the right kinds of attitude are needed as well. Lack of long-term incentives and the requirements of maximizing shareholder value are the main obstacles to risk-taking in the private sector. On the public side, low or zero acceptance of failure limits the room for innovation. Entertainment-driven services are rather easy to be introduced by private companies. The market is there and the major challenge is to create demand for new applications. In the fields of education and health care, major resources are coming from national and local governments. The existing model of collaboration between the public and private sectors limits innovation in sectors that are substantially publicly funded.In order to get education or health care to be digitized, you need systemic reforms. Access to technologies is only one critical element. New types of talents and skills are needed. The regulatory environment has to be changed. Administrative silos are major obstacles to get systemic reforms to take place.""The interest in Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren as presidential candidates suggests that our country may be tiring of competition and forces as its dominating values. Many are concerned about a badly divided country and want our next leader to do something that brings us together."" - Frances StricklandTo whom would you like to give a copy of the book, Uplifting Leadership, and why?Frances Strickland: Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, because I believe he has tried to be an uplifting leader despite the current pushback to his efforts. He rightly identified the failure to deal with the intransigent problems in our low-income schools where little collaboration has led to a lack of trust -- an indispensable ingredient in leadership. If he had followed the principles of Uplifting Leadership and built a healthy balance between competition (push) and collaboration (pull), he would have worked with the AFT and NEA rather than against them. He would have shown appreciation of the assets or strengths within public education and reminded us of America's proud educational accomplishments. Most of all, he would recognize the damage to intrinsic motivation when excessive pushing strategies suggest that performance is more about numbers than relationships and learning.Can you describe one case study in the book that resonated strongly with you and explain why?Frances Strickland: I was caught by the Dogfish Head Craft Brewery study because of a concern I've had about public education since the 1980's. Dogfish was about creativity in a standardized and uniform world -- a world like public education where imaginative educators are suffocated by excessive external controls. The Dogfish founder, Sam Calagione, had the opposite problem. In the creative process, he was responsible and professional. He researched, built on past knowledge, experimented, grew in small steps, evaluated, and was resourceful in his underfunded brewery. But while his quirky, creative style promoted a business culture that was ""fun"" and ""funky"", it also created chaos and inefficiency. He lacked the disciplined organizational skills needed to stabilize his business structure as he free-lanced. With nudging, he hired an organizational person to complement him. Education has the problem in reverse. The imbalance of too much structure and not enough creativity is dragging the system down.""Equipping students with the skills necessary to achieve their full potential, participate in an increasingly interconnected global economy, and ultimately convert better jobs into better lives is now a central preoccupation of policy makers around the world."" - Jeff BeardDo you agree that ""a great education is about being able to drop a student anywhere in the world and know that he/she will not only survive but will thrive""?Jeff Beard: Absolutely! International-mindedness, cultural awareness/sensitivity and critical thinking skills are the tickets for future success in this increasingly flat world. Tom Friedman has, for years, written about how the impact of technology and information is allowing work to be done anywhere in the world better/cheaper/faster than it could be done in the western world. So, traditional teaching methods must now give way to new methods such that our teachers can help students develop these critical thinking and creativity skills. The same ""flat world"" that is transforming the workplace is also transforming the way in which today's students learn. Equipping students with the skills necessary to achieve their full potential, participate in an increasingly interconnected global economy, and ultimately convert better jobs into better lives is now a central preoccupation of policy makers around the world. In today's knowledge-based global economy, jobs will go, more and more, to the best-educated, well-rounded workforce. Parents are now realizing that their children aren't competing only with their peers within their local district, or state -- they are competing with children across the world. Therefore, today's students need to find that extra unique value contribution that makes them stand out, and thrive, regardless of their field of employment and wherever they may be located.If you were selecting a future leader of the U.S.A., what attributes and skills would you be looking for in him or her?Frances Strickland: I want the next president to be loaded with soft skills -- people oriented, collaborative, creative, and focused on the long term as well as the short term. I want that person to have a clear vision and a positive set of values; I want to hear them communicated over and over. I want that person to demonstrate community by going to the front lines of suffering and engaging the affected in all efforts to find solutions. In short, I want a leader with the values usually associated with women -including the desire for peace. The interest in Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren as presidential candidates suggests that our country may be tiring of competition and force as its dominating values. Many are concerned about a badly divided country and want our next leader to do something that brings us together. The adoption of the principles of Uplifting Leadership would help do just that.

No need for us to drive him this year. He was taking his Jeep. ""There will be guys to help.""He of course had packed his car when he left his job. Guitars. Golf clubs. Clothes pretty much thrown in wherever they would fit. Not exactly as neatly packed as his father would have done it but it worked.I had made one contribution to his return. I had sewed on a button. This is a major feat since my 10th grade teacher, Mrs. Mitosinka, only gave me a B in home economics if I promised never to sew again. But my son asked me to sew on a button, so I sewed on a button.Pretty darn good job if I do say so myself.Tight hugs goodbye. We had had a fantastic two days.Tears as he drove away. That heavy dull feeling crept into my soul. Just an ache.I had forgotten the next day was the beginning of the school year in Fayetteville. Much to my dismay at first, and then my delight, I was stuck in the long line of cars in front of an elementary school. Marching along the street were a colorful parade of entire families. All to celebrate going back to school. Dads carrying tousled toddlers on their shoulders. Moms pushing baby carriages. Younger kids clasping the hands of their older brothers and sisters, dressed in not-a-spot-on-'em outfits. Brightly-colored backpacks tightly fit onto their little bodies. Some smiling. Some staring down at their feet, perhaps overwhelmed. What looked like the occasional fifth grader. Far too mature for all of this -- not wanting to walk too close to the parent who was three feet behind him.It was wonderful.What a difference a few years make.But not really.Parents. Loving their kids. Watching them grow. Change. Transition.Letting go.Later the same morning, I got an email from a friend who had just gotten home from taking her only child to college. She had known the feelings would come.Dealing with them was overwhelming.It hurt my own heart to hear the rawness of her pain. Beginning to accept those first hours of an emptier, quieter house.I wrote her about my own sobbing fit the day we got back from taking Rob to Vanderbilt that first year. I tried to normalize and describe what the next few days and weeks might feel like.Like living in a world that is familiar and totally unfamiliar all at the same time.That time was painful.My grandparents had a gorgeous old grandfather clock. I used to love to listen to and anticipate its deep resonant sound.Tick... Tock... Tick... Tock...That inevitable, tangible reflection of time passing. Yet the comfort of knowing the regularity of the ticks themselves.When I looked at those parents and children, I heard the anguish in my friend's heart. The joy and pride of one moment. The emptiness and confusion of another. My own tears as I watched my son drive away.I remember that time will keep passing. That feelings change. They constantly evolve.There will be other joys. Other smiles. Sorrows and contentments.I find comfort in that thought.I have watched so many people grieve. I know that even the deepest grief can abate. The human spirit heals.Tick.... Tock.

A hearing will be held at a later date for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law.""Plaintiffs will be allowed to operate lawfully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges,"" Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in the decision.Abortion rights activists applauded the decision, the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give abortion doctors more time to seek the hospital privileges.""Today's ruling ensures Louisiana women are safe from an underhanded law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights,"" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued to block the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently ruling unconstitutional such measures in Alabama and Mississippi. Key parts of Texas law that would have shuttered most remaining clinics in that state was blocked by a federal judge on Friday.Abortion rights campaigners, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admitting privileges laws impose medically unnecessary requirements on doctors.Anti-abortion advocates have countered that the measures are intended to protect women's health, though some have also lauded their effect of shuttering clinics.Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana currently has hospital admitting privileges, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, that doctor, fearful for his safety, would stop carrying out the procedure, the group said.

(AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13c832300003300d0bb7e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Noah BarkinBERLIN, Sept 1 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended her government's taboo-breaking decision to send arms to Kurds fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq, telling parliament on Monday that the group posed a major security threat to Germany and Europe.A day after Berlin announced it would send anti-tank rockets, assault rifles and hand grenades to the Kurds, Merkel said Germany had a responsibility to intervene in the conflict to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Iraq, citing evidence of ethnic cleansing by Islamic State fighters.""The far-reaching destabilization of an entire region affects Germany and Europe,"" Merkel said in a speech to the Bundestag lower house, noting that the Islamist group controlled an area in Iraq and Syria that was half the size of Germany.""Ladies and gentlemen, when terrorists take control of a vast territory to give themselves and other fanatics a base for their acts of terror, then the danger rises for us, then our security interests are affected,"" she added.Germany, weighed down by its Nazi past, has shied away from direct involvement in military missions for much of the post-war era. And even in those conflicts where German troops have been involved, such as Afghanistan, politicians have tended to describe the missions as humanitarian, rebuilding exercises rather than war.Recent polls show that two in three Germans believe the government should not be sending weapons to Kurdish fighters despite reports of atrocities committed by Islamic State insurgents.Critics fear the arms could end up in the hands of jihadists. Others worry that Germany, which has not experienced a major attack on its own soil, could become a target itself if it intervenes.But Merkel noted in her speech that over 400 Germans and hundreds of other Europeans had traveled to the region to join the fight alongside Islamic State, sometimes referred to as ISIS. These fighters could return home at any time, she said, and therefore already represented a direct threat to Germany.STUNG BY CRITICISM""We faced a choice: not to take any risks, not to deliver (arms) and to accept the spread of terror; or to support those who are desperately but courageously fighting the barbarous terror of ISIS with limited resources,"" Merkel said.""We are aware of the risks of this support, of course we considered them. But we also asked ourselves about the acute risks from ISIS if we do not deliver arms.""Germany has already shipped humanitarian aid and defensive equipment, such as helmets and body armor, to Iraqi Kurds.On Sunday, the government released a new list which includes 16,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles, 30 Milan anti-tank missile systems, 240 rocket-propelled grenade launchers (RPGs) and 10,000 hand grenades.The move comes three years after Germany came under sharp criticism from its allies and some critics at home for siding with China and Russia in refusing to back military intervention in Libya in a United Nations vote.Stung by that criticism, members of Merkel's new ""grand coalition"" government, including Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, spoke out earlier this year about the need for Germany to assume more responsibility in foreign affairs.Since then, Berlin has played an active role in mediating in the Ukraine crisis and pushing for European sanctions against Russia. The decision to send arms to Iraq represents yet another step in the direction of a more active foreign policy.""What is new is that in an acute crisis situation, German arms are being delivered in order to influence the crisis, to help a partner and to prevent danger. This hasn't happened before,"" Volker Perthes, the head of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs told Reuters. ""It is clear that something is changing in Germany.""

A new hope is born on every sunrise to see Dr. Mohamed Arab once again with us.""These words from the sister of Syrian doctor Mohamed Bashir Arab reveals something about the special hell family members go through when loved ones face ""enforced disappearances"" by government authorities. An ""enforced disappearance"" takes place when a person is arrested, detained or abducted by the state or agents acting for the state, who then deny that the person is being held or conceal their whereabouts, placing them outside the protection of the law.From Syria to El Salvador, North Korea to Laos, family members wake every morning hoping that this is the day that some news is confirmed, and to end every day being denied information and closure.Each year, August 30 marks the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearance, which aims to highlight the plight of thousands of people around the world who have been subjected to enforced disappearance and the suffering of their families. But it is not enough to just highlight the names and stories of the disappeared: This should also be an occasion to act.We act on behalf of 62-year-old Laotian civil society leader Sombath Somphone, who was abducted in December 2012. Video footage shows him getting out of his car to talk to police after being stopped at a checkpoint. A motorcyclist then drives up and takes his car, and moments later a truck with flashing lights pulls up and takes Somphone away. Laos authorities deny arresting him or having anything to do with his disappearance, and have failed to thoroughly investigate the case. We act on behalf of political cartoonist/journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda of Sri Lanka, a country where journalists have been at particular risk for threats and harassment. He went missing on January 24, 2010, shortly after leaving work at his news office. He had told friends in the days leading up to his abduction that he suspected he was being followed. When his wife tried to lodge a complaint the day after he disappeared, she was detained for several hours. Since 2006, 14 journalists have been killed in Sri Lanka without anyone being held accountable. Many others have been detained or threatened.We act on behalf of six Palestinian men who were ""disappeared"" while in custody in a Palestinian Authority detention center in on March 12, 2002. Government officials have provided little information about the whereabouts of the men, telling family members only that ""they had escaped prison and fled to Israel."" Before their disappearance, family members of the six men reported that they showed signs of torture, such as marks on their hands and feet that indicated they were tied in painful positions. At no time were the men formally charged.We act on behalf of hundreds of Syrian detainees who appear to have been subjected to enforced disappearance. While the number of disappearances has increased since the beginning of the Syrian uprising in 2011, the practice is not new. Amnesty International has been documenting cases of enforced disappearance in Syria since the late 1970s.In every one of these cases, there is an answer. There is someone in these governments who knows where these people are or what happened to them. We implore these governments to cease the practice of enforced disappearance, and to thoroughly investigate the whereabouts of all people who have been disappeared. "
6,POLITICS,A Labor Day Documentary: 'Brothers on the Line' Tells the Story of the Reuther Brothers -- Founding Fathers of the American Middle Class,"Peter Dreier, ContributorE.P.

It is unfortunate that the Reuther brothers (Walter, Roy and Victor), who built the United Auto Workers union that transformed the broader labor movement and helped build the nation's middle class, would probably not make the list because few Americans know much about labor history. A new documentary film, Brothers on the Line, may help remind America about these three courageous union organizers who deserve a place in the pantheon of America's social justice heroes. (Left) Victor, Roy and Walter Reuther. (Right) Walter Reuther with civil rights leaders Roy Wilkins and A. Philip Randolph at the 1963 March on Washington Even as we celebrate Labor Day, few Americans understand the crucial role that the union movement has played in improving the lives of working people in terms of better pay, safer working conditions, and improved health care, retirement, and educational opportunities. And, as events in Ferguson, Missouri unfold and draw attention to the persistence of racism in America, it is good to be reminded, as Brothers on the Line does well, that the Reuthers and the UAW were at the forefront of the civil rights movement, as close allies of Martin Luther King, Cesar Chavez, and other progressives. The film is currently available for rent or purchase on iTunes, Google Play, and Amazon Instant across the U.S. and Canada.The Reuthers would surely be upset about the current state of organized labor (which now represents only seven percent of private sector employees), but hopeful about some the resurgence of activism among fast food, hotel, hospital, port, Walmart, and other workers as well as the growing movement in cities around the country to raise the minimum wage. Brothers on the Line shows us that the struggle for workers' rights goes hand in hand with the battles for a more humane society.""We are the vanguard in America of that great crusade to build a better world,"" Walter Reuther told about 3,000 members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) at the union's 1947 convention. ""We are the architects of the future.""The 40-year-old UAW president was preparing his members, many of them military veterans, for another kind of war, one that would pit unions and their progressive allies against the increasingly concentrated power of big business, a war whose battlefields would be the shop floor, the bargaining table, the voting booth, and the halls of Congress.Walter was the best-known and most influential of the brothers, a household name in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, whose photo adorned the cover of TIME magazine in 1945. But the film (produced by Sasha Reuther, Victor's grandson) makes it clear that Walter, Roy and Victor were part of a team who recognized that a successful union requires rank-and-file shop floor militants, mid-level strategists and ""inside"" activists, and visible public leaders who can inspire the nation, negotiate with corporate chieftans, and confer with presidents. All three began as shopfloor militants and eventually rose to prominence within the UAW. Walter was elected UAW president in 1946 and served in that position until he was killed in a plane crash in 1970. Victor served as head of its educational and later its international office. Roy became the director of the UAW's political department. The 80-minute documentary understandably spends more time on Walter than on his brothers, although Victor -- who was probably the most radical of the trio -- gets his due for his brilliant tactical maneuvers during the 1930s organizing drives, for getting the UAW to support democratic unions around the world, and for encouraging Walter to oppose the Vietnam war. Victor was the only one of the brothers still alive when his grandson made the film. He is a wonderful storyteller and the clips of his speeches and his interviews sprinkled throughout the film are a highlight. Roy, who as the UAW's political director, helped elect John F. Kennedy, used its influence to push Congress to enact Medicare, Medicaid, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and other key laws, and persuaded Walter to support the United Farm Workers, gets less airtime in the film.The film weaves together archival newsreel footage, tapes of speeches, narration by Martin Sheen, and interviews (with rank-and-file UAW members and union leaders as well as Reuther allies like Ted Kennedy, John Conyers, Dolores Huerta, and Andrew Young), and a few academics, most usefully labor historian Kevin Boyle. Brothers on the Line could serve as a basic introduction to key trends and moments of the 20th century, including the rise of mass production, the emergence of big cities, the exodus of blacks from the South to the North and Midwest, the social and political turmoil of the Depression, the rise of the auto industry as the lynchpin of post-war American prosperity, the battles to unionize the Big Three auto companies against outrageous corporate terrorism, the emergence of the civil rights movement, and the turmoil and conflict over the Vietnam war. (The film overlooks two key aspects of the Reuthers' story and the 20th century - World War 2 and the birth of the environmental movement). The Reuthers grew up in Wheeling, West Virginia, three of the five children of Valentine Reuther, a German immigrant, a Socialist, and an activist in the brewery workers' union. In 1919 Valentine took Walter and his brother Victor, ages eleven and six, to visit Socialist Party leader Eugene Debs at a prison outside Wheeling, where he was being held for his opposition to World War I. The visit made an indelible impression on both young Reuthers, who became committed Socialists.Walter quit high school at age sixteen and became an apprentice tool-and-die maker. He moved to Detroit in 1927, drawn by the Ford Motor Company's promise of high wages and a shorter workweek. He quickly established himself as one of the most skilled toolmakers at Ford's massive River Rouge plant. Victor and Roy joined Reuther in Detroit and on the assembly lines in the growing mass production auto plants. The exhausting and inhumane conditions -- speed-up, close scrutiny and anti-union intimidation by supervisors, the lack of job security, the blatant racism that assigned black workers to the most dangerous and dirtiest jobs -- led Walter to characterize the industry as a ""social jungle"" in which workers were ""nameless, faceless, clock-card numbers.""The Depression deepened the Reuthers' already radical outlook. Working nights, Walter earned his high school diploma at the age of 22 and took classes at Detroit City College (now Wayne State University), where he was joined by his younger brothers. Walter and his friends formed a Social Problems Club on campus and affiliated with the Socialist League of Industrial Democracy, organized protests against establishing a Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) unit on campus, and protested the segregation of a local swimming pool leased by the college. In 1932 Walter campaigned for Socialist Party presidential candidate Norman Thomas and was promptly fired by Ford, which kept a close eye on its employees' nonwork lives.The following year, Walter and Victor embarked on a world tour, hoping to work at the Soviet Union's huge Gorki automobile factory, which Henry Ford had equipped. The brothers spent a year helping train the Gorki tool-and-die workers. Reuther was impressed by Russia's quick transformation into a modern industrial society, but he also saw the repression under Stalin's totalitarian regime, an experience that shaped the brothers' anticommunism during the Cold War.The three brothers played key roles in the major union organizing battles in Detroit, Flint, and other auto industry centers. Walter and Victor returned to Detroit in 1935. Walter never worked on the shop floor again, but channeled his talent and ambitions into building the fledgling auto workers' union. Victor got a job at the Kelsey-Hayes Wheel Company, in Flint, Michigan. Together they led a successful sit-down strike at Kelsey-Hayes, a Ford supplier with 5,000 employees. The strike led to a settlement that doubled workers' wages. Walter and Victor both played roles in the 1936 General Motors strike in Flint, with its now infamous scenes of pro-GM cops attacking workers with billy clubs and tear gas. During the strike, Victor, then 24, drove around Flint in a car equipped with a loudspeaker on the roof, encouraging the ""sit-down"" strikers who had occupied the factories. The strike spread to over 100 other plants, virtually shutting down GM's production. When the strike was settled, winning many improvements in pay and working conditions, the Reuther brothers' exploits became well-known. In Victor's case, it meant that he and his wife Sophie (the UAW's first woman organizer) had to leave town to evade a warrant for their arrest issued by a pro-GM judge. On May 26, 1937, Walter and other UAW organizers were passing out leaflets at a pedestrian overpass next to Ford's factory complex in Dearborn, Michigan. As the film shows, Ford's private police organization, euphemistically called the Service Department, attacked the union activists in what became known as the ""Battle of the Overpass."" Newspaper photographers captured Ford's thugs beating Reuther bloody. At a time of widespread pro-union sympathy, the incident was a public relations nightmare for Ford. Even so, it took almost four more years -- until April 1941, when a huge strike shut down Ford's operations -- before the company recognized the UAW and signed a union contract.The Reuthers had many enemies -- among the auto companies, the mob (whose influence within the unions the Reuthers sought to squash), right-wing vigilantes, and opposing factions within the union. In the 1940s, both Walter and Victor were victims of assassination attempts that caused permanent physical harm. The film chillingly recounts these episodes through interviews with friends and family members.The film skips Walter's first major foray into social planning. In 1940, when half the auto factories were idle, he proposed a bold plan to convert idle factories to build 500 military aircraft a day. A brilliant student of industrial engineering and planning, Reuther's plan would put employees back to work, serve a patriotic goal, and put labor on an equal footing with business in planning the war economy. But the auto executives did not want to share decision making with government bureaucrats, much less with union leaders, and they rejected the idea out of hand. Once the nation went to war, however, President Franklin D. Roosevelt frequently consulted Reuther (whom he once called ""my young red-headed engineer"") on wartime production problems. Anticipating the war's end, Reuther proposed creating a three-part peace production board (with representative from business, labor, and government) to convert defense plants so they could produce railroad cars and workers' housing. To many Americans, this idea seemed like common sense. But business viewed it, correctly, as a radical shift of power, reducing business's influence in shaping the economy. One Detroit auto executive, George Romney (father of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney), understood Reuther's genius: ""Walter Reuther is the most dangerous man in Detroit because no one is more skillful in bringing about the revolution without seeming to disturb the existing forms of society.""When the war ended, Reuther was determined to put the labor movement on a more equal footing with corporate America. In 1946 he led a 116-day strike against GM. Autoworkers' buying power had eroded during the war, and the UAW demanded a 30 percent pay increase without an increase in the retail price of cars. When GM insisted that it could not meet the union's demand, Reuther challenged the company to ""open its books."" GM refused, but the UAW won an 18 percent wage increase.But Reuther was making a larger point, one he would return to many times, particularly after he was elected UAW president in 1946. By demanding that GM freeze its prices, Reuther was appealing to consumers as well as to UAW members. He argued that the automobile industry -- the largest and most profitable companies in the world -- had a responsibility to society as well as to its stockholders and its workers. And it was the labor movement's responsibility not only to look out for its members but also to use its influence -- at the bargaining table with business and in the political realm with government -- to make America a more livable society for all. ""What good is a dollar-an-hour more in wages if your neighborhood is burning down?"" Reuther asked, in a speech that unfortunately isn't included in the film. ""What good is another week's vacation if the lake you used to go to is polluted, and you can't swim in it and the kids can't play in it?""Using the UAW's clout within the labor movement and with the Democratic Party, Reuther pushed a progressive postwar agenda that included national health care, economic redistribution, full employment, and job security for all.Reuther's call for a progressive social contract among government, business, and labor was too radical for most Democrats, especially as the Cold War was heating up. So Reuther sought to achieve similar goals at the bargaining table, creating, in effect, a private welfare state for those Americans lucky enough to work for the nation's biggest corporations and to have a union contract. In 1948 the UAW got GM to agree to a historic contract tying wage increases to the general cost of living and to productivity increases. Over the next two decades, UAW members won unprecedented benefits, including enhanced job security, paid vacations, and health insurance. In 1955 the UAW won supplemental unemployment benefits that enabled UAW members to earn up to 95 percent of their regular paycheck even if they were laid off. Reuther hailed that provision as ""the first time in the history of collective bargaining [that] great corporations agreed to begin to accept responsibility"" for their workers during layoffs.The union used strikes -- or the threat of work stoppages -- to gain these victories. It took a strike at Ford in 1949 to establish the union's right to have a voice in the speed of the assembly line. It took a 100-day strike at Chrysler in 1950 to win a pension plan.As a result of these victories, UAW members were able to buy homes, move to the suburbs, send their children to college, take regular vacations, and anticipate a secure retirement. The UAW set the standard for other unions to win similar benefits from other major industries.The UAW was on the front line of the civil rights movement. Reuther marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders in Mississippi and elsewhere. The UAW helped fund the 1963 March on Washington (which the AFL-CIO refused to endorse) and brought many of its members to the historic protest. Reuther was one of the few white speakers at the march. The UAW used its political clout to lobby for passage of the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and the Fair Housing Act. Reuther was also an early and generous supporter of Cesar Chavez's efforts to organize farmworkers, marched with Chavez on numerous occasions, and supported the boycott of nonunion grapes and lettuce, long before other union leaders recognized the importance of the farmworkers' struggle.Reuther advised Presidents. Kennedy and Johnson to champion a bold federal program for full employment that would include government-funded public works and the conversion of the nation's defense industry to production for civilian needs. This, he argued, would dramatically address the nation's poor, create job opportunities for African Americans, and rebuild America's troubled cities without being as politically divisive as a federal program identified primarily as serving low-income blacks.Both presidents rejected Reuther's advice. They were worried about alienating racist southern Democrats and sectors of business who opposed Keynesian-style economic planning. LBJ's announcement of an ""unconditional war on poverty"" in his 1964 State of the Union address pleased Reuther, but the details of the plan revealed its limitations. Testifying before Congress in April 1964, Reuther said, ""While [the proposals] are good, [they] are not adequate, nor will they be successful in achieving their purposes, except as we begin to look at the broader problems [of the American economy]."" He added, ""Poverty is a reflection of our failure to achieve a more rational, more responsible, more equitable distribution of the abundance that is within our grasp."" Reuther threw the UAW's considerable political weight behind LBJ's programs, but his critique proved to be correct.In 1952 Reuther was elected president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and three years later brokered a merger with American Federation of Labor (AFL) president George Meany. By then about one-third of America's workers were union members. Reuther hoped that the AFL-CIO would spearhead a new wave of union organizing, particularly in the South, but he was constantly frustrated by the indifference of many unions to organizing the unorganized or to mobilizing their members for political action. In 1966 Reuther said, ""The AFL-CIO lacks the social vision, the dynamic thrust, the crusading spirit that should characterize the progressive modern labor movement."" Two years later he withdrew the UAW from the AFL-CIO and forged a new labor group, the Alliance for Labor Action, with the Teamsters union. Reuther had big plans for the organization, but before it could launch any initiatives, Reuther, his wife, and two others were killed in a private plane crash in 1970. Brothers on the Line does an excellent job of explaining why Walter was reluctant to oppose the Vietnam war, whatever his personal views about that conflict. He had a close working relationship with President Johnson, who endorsed many of Walter's views on civil rights, anti-poverty, and labor issues. The film lets us in on a remarkable phone call between Walter and LBJ in which the president uses all his charm and persuasive powers to convince Reuther to publicly support the war. ""I want you to tell the rest of them that I'm no goddamn fascist,"" Johnson said, referring to Walter's fellow liberals, who were increasingly critical of LBJ's Vietnam policy. After the murders of King and Bobby Kennedy, however, Walter was more open to hearing his children and Victor's arguments against the war and changed his public stance. The film does not overlook two of the most troubling aspects of Walter's ascendancy in the UAW and the labor movement. Although Walter was often at odds with the conservative Meany, who resisted putting more resources into rank-and-file organizing, Reuther shared some of the blame as well. He viewed the Communists within the UAW and the broader labor movement -- who included some of the most experienced and effective organizers -- as a threat. During the Red Scare, he used anti-Communism as an excuse to expel the radicals from the labor movement, weakening its left wing and creating a vacuum filled by more conservative factions. Reuther was also slow to bring more than a handful of black workers into the UAW's leadership ranks. Although Reuther was a powerful champion of civil rights, many African-American autoworkers -- radicalized by the Black Power movement -- were angered by his failure to recruit and groom blacks into the union's top leadership. Under the Reuthers' leadership, the UAW grew to become the nation's largest and most powerful union, with more than 1.5 million members. It has since shrunk to about 355,000 members, reflecting the outrageous mismanagement and declining fortunes of the U.S. auto industry, the relocation of many auto factories to right-to-work states in the South, and increasing competition from European and Asian auto companies. General Motors, once the largest and most successful corporation in the world, is now profitable but employs many fewer American workers. It has been replaced by companies like Walmart, now the world's largest private employer. Walmart -- like GM before it -- has poured enormous resources into fighting efforts by its employees to unionize. Among Walmart's more than one million American workers, there are many potential union leaders -- many of them now part of OUR Walmart -- who will eventually find ways to successfully challenge the company and build a strong voice for employees. Perhaps there are even three sisters who now work at Walmart and will become national leaders in this new wave of workplace organizing. And 25 or 50 years from now, one of their grandchildren will make a film about them -- Sisters on the Line.Peter Dreier teaches Politics and chairs the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College.

Is this true or not? Have you seen it?“Then, in the end this marriage comes to old age in solitude, with the bitterness of loneliness.“Francis is not the first pope to celebrate a marriage ceremony but his predecessor Benedict XVI never presided over a marriage during his eight-year pontificate, which ended with his resignation in 2013.The September ceremony will be the first celebration of a wedding since former pope St. John Paul II married eight couples at a Mass to mark the Jubilee for Families in October 2000.John Paul presided over another joint wedding for a group of couples in 1994 during celebrations of the International Year of the Family."
