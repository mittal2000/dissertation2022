Isolated on white,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c646926000036007f760c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Having re-entered the dating world after a twelve year marriage that ended abruptly and traumatically in divorce, I wanted a new and improved sex life as I moved forward. As with most long-term relationships, sex had become predictable and a bit formulaic. I wanted to be a sex goddess, but a brief review of the books and porn flicks at the Hustler Store did not provide the information that I had in mind.Walking down Melrose one day in Los Angeles, I ran into a boutique that sold high-end luxury sex products. Housed in a former townhouse with a lush garden and fountain, it stocked vibrators made of sterling silver, oils from Asia, Belgian lace corsets, nipple tassels and much more. A beautiful saleswoman was explaining some of the products to me and mentioned that they ran a series of exclusive, expensive tutorials limited to twelve women and taught by an expert from San Francisco. Eureka! This was exactly what I needed to expand and update my bedroom knowledge in a refined setting. I forked over the tuition fee on the spot for a seminar entitled ""The Art of the Joystick.""The evening arrived for my class and I was insanely excited. The store was closed, and chairs were arranged around a velvet couch and a table full of props. The other students were younger than I, mostly in their 30's, attractive, and, like me, were intent on learning a few new tricks. After gulping some champagne that was offered to loosen us up and help us to feel more comfortable, we sat down and the teacher was introduced. Marika was a plain Asian woman, probably in her mid-forties, with long brown hair and dressed in very conservative attire. She began the lecture by asking us to call out various nicknames for the penis, which she wrote on a plain white board. This was a brilliant opener -- it made us relax, laugh and feel comfortable with the subject. Then she got down to business.Each of us was given a cucumber, a lubricated pad and a condom. She demonstrated the sexy way to apply the condom by mouth. Then she had each of us practice the technique. She obviously had an Ivy League degree in pleasure.The two hours passed all too quickly. I was looking forward to doing my homework and mastering these new tricks. But most importantly, it was empowering to know that I still wanted to have an active and fun sex life and was open to learning something new and different."

First came the clothing line, then the app and now... Urban Outfitters. Frank and her cheery cartoon animals never really went away (according to The Daily, by 2005 the company declared revenue topping $1 billion over its 15-year-history). But children of the '90s, those who swapped out their neon binders and folders for tamer fare in the aughts, are apparently now ready to re-embrace Lisa Frank in all its ironic glory.And where better to embark on an irony-drenched shopping spree than Urban Outfitters? The ubiquitous retailer is now selling ""limited edition vintage"" Lisa Frank items, including stickers, folders and stationery. The pieces, exclusive to Urban, have ""been hiding away in Lisa's own secret stash and may have subtle imperfections"" and include many of the characters you know and love: the dancing bunnies, the painting panda, the rainbow-tailed unicorns. Urban Outfitters has even launched a Lisa Frank Contest with its own #UOxLisaFrank hashtag (win by tweeting your best Lisa Frank-inspired doodle, ideally done during third period science class). This is all awesome news for anyone born before the year 1990 -- or people who like their school supplies so bright they could blind them.

The statements need to be purely factual and non-controversial, he said.A Justice Department lawyer said the proposed statements are factual, based on Kessler's 2006 decision, and that the public needs to be aware of the extent of the companies' lying.""The tobacco companies would love these statements to be generic health warnings. They would love these statements to be about their products and not about them,"" said the Justice Department's Daniel Crane-Hirsch.Kessler said she would rule on the proposed wording of the ""corrective statements"" soon.The dispute is the latest round in a legal fight between the government and major cigarette-makers dating to the Clinton administration.In 1999 Justice Department lawyers accused the companies of running a fraud against Americans by denying or downplaying the effects of their products.One 1954 newspaper ad, for example, dismissed experiments suggesting a link between cancer and smoking. ""We accept an interest in people's health as a basic responsibility, paramount to every other consideration in our business,"" the ad said.Kessler ruled that the companies violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a 1970 law designed for use against organized crime.She rejected a Justice Department proposal that the companies pay billions for anti-smoking campaigns, but she did bar them from using terms such as ""low tar"" or ""light"" in their cigarette marketing, and she required them to make corrective statements to the public."

I say, ""Seize the season!""",2012-10-15,"CANNES, FRANCE - MAY 23: Kate Upton attends the 'On The Road' Premiere during the 65th Annual Cannes Film Festival at Palais des Festivals on May 23, 2012 in Cannes, France. (Photo by Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c65ae2100005100c51ba7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With the change of seasons, it can have a magical effect that can ignite the desire for something new, a personal change inside and out. A hair-color change might just be on the radar. Without thought, I tend to think of certain colors that are reminiscent of the season: auburns for fall, crimson-red for winter, sun-kissed-brown for spring and golden-wheat for summer.There are numerous techniques that will give you revamped looks for the changing seasons. If you'd like to give a fresh look to an existing hair color choice, it can be done with the least bit of effort. Many will shy from a big color change. So, for those who are taking baby steps in the color world, the familiar cliché, ""less is best"" is something to reflect on. The smallest bit of change can make a huge difference. We all know that it doesn't take a change of season to opt for a color tweak. For the ""daring"" and ""get-bored-quickly"" ones, any reason is good enough. There are many innovative color trends in the hair color world today. To describe a few, the ombre technique is very much in demand at the moment. This process is an easy fix to change from a prior color choice. The ombre technique is executed by fading the darker tone of color from the crown of the head and fading it to a lighter midsection of the hair to lighter ends. You can reverse the order of color from light to dark, as well. There are so many variables to achieve this technique. The maintenance can be low and the results are fresh and sexy. There is the block color technique, which gives the hair lots of dimension. Two or more colors are used in this process. It is a great look for the edgy, but can still be applicable for the more conservative. The pivoting color technique can be a more stunningly drastic look. The color is applied in a pivoted direction, usually from the crown of the head. Again, more than one color can be used, or you can apply different hues of color within one color of choice to create your own color trend. This particular color technique is great on short cuts with exaggerated lengths within the haircut. The tone-on-tone technique is incredibly beautiful and, of course, there is the balayage technique. The balayage process works great on blondes along with other various shades of hair color. Actress Michelle Williams exudes taste with her pixie blonde coif. Whether she uses this method or not, her hair is timeless and chic. The balayage method has been around for a long time and is still creating fantastic transformational looks.Certain chemical processes, other than color, will limit your spectrum in the color world. Whatever your boundaries are, there are color remedies that will give you that needed color change. If you are using a Keratin Treatment, always get your hair colored before the process. It is much more difficult to lighten the hair after this process because of the coating of keratin that has been deposited. Having the keratin administered after color also enhances the color tone and makes it shinier. If you have relaxed hair with sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide etc., use a color process that complements your chemically relaxed hair. There are color-friendly relaxers out there that will give you a ticket to the fantasy world of color. A color process that requires bleach on relaxed hair is a ""no-no."" You can also get very creative looks with the demi and semi hair colors. These hair colors complement relaxed hair. When receiving one or more chemical processes, the hair needs more attention in the moisture department. There are plenty of oil treatments on the market today, along with deep nourishing and moisturizing masks. These are a ""must do"" when maintaining great color and healthy hair.With unlimited possibilities coupled with great imagination in the color trending world, you can achieve your own personalized look. I say, ""Seize the season!"""

Shoppers spent 5.6 percent more in September than last year at small retailers, which represents the slowest year-over-year growth so far in 2012 as the tough economy weighs on Americans. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c68e12500003500360e07.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"American households have gotten their financial footing back when it comes to debt and that could help the economy recover faster, economists say. Household consumer debt is now back to pre-recession levels according to analysis from Moody's, Bloomberg and the Los Angeles Times reported. For Americans, that means a smaller chunk of every paycheck is going to paying off credit cards, mortgages and car loans. One notable exception to the paydown trend is student loans, which have soared in recent years as the costs for higher education have increased.Economists are waiting to see if consumers will feel comfortable spending again or if their newfound penny pinching will sustain as the economic forecast remains grim. Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi said the use of credit by U.S households would no longer be a ""headwind"" for the economy, but could soon help boost it instead, Bloomberg reported.However, other economic concerns are still holding many American families back. In addition to stagnant wages, many households could face higher tax bills in 2013. Americans are also seeing higher spending across the board due to rising food and gas prices and increasing health insurance costs. ""We're going to try to live within our means because living beyond it didn't work out,"" Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago told the Los Angeles Times. During the economic recession, Americans took a more defensive position when it came to their finances. That meant paying off debt and reducing expenses. The massive number of foreclosures that occurred during the financial crisis has also reduced or eliminated mortgage debt for many households.With the holiday shopping season right around the corner, economists are watching consumer sentiment to see if the recession-era mentality will last or if Americans will loosen their purse strings. One signal that Americans are ready to spend more: Consumer sentiment is at the highest levels it has been in five years, according to a Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumers in October.Other data also suggest Americans are ready to spend. Retail spending rose by 1.1 percent in September, according to the Commerce Department. That bump was helped by an increase in auto spending along with spending on the new iPhone 5."
7,WEDDINGS,A Wedding Planner's Predictions For The Marital Futures Of The New Jersey 'Housewives',"Sandy Malone, Contributor

(AP Photo/Evan Agostini)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c68ab2500003300360de7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Is anybody else still suffering post-traumatic stress from watching the ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"" reunion specials the last couple of weeks? I'm almost sick to admit that I'm addicted. I never wanted to tell anybody that I was a superfan, but I couldn't look away in case I missed something even more off-the-wall. While I'd like to go on all day about how horrified I am by the show -- especially by the fact that beautiful Lauren felt the need to go through lap band surgery to lose 35 pounds -- on the brighter side, I'm very, very happy to report that I see several very rock-solid marriages in that ensemble of people and I think it's worth talking about. It isn't often that people really put their families and their marriages that far out there in the public eye for scrutiny -- it may seem like it, but when have you seen this much dirty laundry on one show? The good news is that there are some good examples of solid marriages that can serve as an example to those of us who are addicted. I know, that's like claiming the nuts in a Snickers bar add nutritional value. But you get the idea.So here we go -- my armchair psychologist/self-appointed marital expert self will share her opinions on the Jersey ""Housewives'"" marriages:Caroline and what's-his-face are a team, and despite getting some boosts from family, all their kids are gainfully employed and working. I think any parent who can help their kid get on their grown-up feet should -- and I applaud them. They will be together forever.Kathy and Richie are obviously each other's wingmen (but if my husband ever made any reference to ""fish"" in any way to anyone about me, I would have him disposed of like a dead tuna), and they seem to be raising bright, well-adjusted children in the limelight. He needs to stay away from her business ventures because he undermines her and makes himself look stupid. I don't think it's intentional. I just think he's an ass. They will be married for a long time unless he makes another one of those fish references.My own marriage to my husband Bill is a combination of Jacqueline/Chris and Melissa/Joe. Jacqueline obviously has a lot going on (autistic son, difficult daughter, BFF issues) and her husband has made it damn clear that his number one priority is protecting her from further emotional damage. He tried to make things better behind the scenes for her by talking to Teresa's husband before the RV trip, but that guy is about as receptive as a brick wall so it was a total waste. Chris still gets points for trying. Who knows what is going to happen there long-term. I'd hope that Nick's autism brings them closer instead of driving a wedge. That's a heck of a stresser on a marriage. My husband Bill is a lot like Chris in our marriage -- he tries his best to protect me from the inevitable heartache and pain associated with life, love, family and friendships. He lets me handle myself and my own business, but if you cross a line, he will step in and intervene. He calls it the IV Rule. When I was in the hospital a few years ago, they had trouble with my IVs and I had to have several different ones installed in a couple days. It hurt and I tried not to yipe, but Bill is less forgiving. You get two sticks at his wife and after that, you better go get somebody else. If you make me cry, you should just plain run. That applies to every aspect of our marriage and life -- not just at the doctor's office.Melissa and Joe are rock-freaking-solid... even if he is a little freaky. It doesn't matter if anybody else thinks she can sing or that she was a stripper, he doesn't care or is OK with it or whatever. That blood is thicker than water crap goes away when you get married. Once you get married, your spouse becomes your lifeline. If you hurt Melissa, Joe will come after you. I must admit that as a cop's wife, it's a quality I admire. Bill can't run around hitting people for me, unfortunately. But it helps that he scares the hell out of them. Joe's enthusiasm for every venture Melissa endeavors is absolutely fantastic, and he's just like my husband in that way. When I said let's give up Washington, DC, and solid careers, and move to the Caribbean to plan weddings, he believed in me and retired. No matter what anybody else anywhere may think, Bill loves and supports me and believes I can achieve anything that I set out to do. Joe's the same way about Melissa. Their kids are going to do great if they don't turn them into little stars before they get the chance to have a real childhood -- Melissa seems like a really fun mom. And in the not-so-solid camp there's Teresa and Joe. They are a hot mess and everyone in America knows it. There are times when you take one for the team because it's best for your family and your future (Hillary Clinton after Monica, for example), but when your husband publicly humiliates you to get his jollies on a family trip with an entire camera crew¸ the marriage is completely over. If I were her friend (she must have some friends left who aren't on the show and don't have the name ""Kim""), I'd sit her down to make a pros and cons list about why she should even be considering staying married to this future jailbird. Money, children, position, yada yada yada... dude doesn't love you Teresa. He's a mean bastard who talks to you like you are trash in front of a camera crew. He tells you to shut up and you do. You whine at him so much that he hasn't heard you in years. Your children are going to be all messed up if you don't get them out of that house. What the hell are you thinking???I used to admire Teresa's tenacity. I do think she gets set up by the other girls (what is it about the name Kim?) and I think that she has done an incredible job with merchandizing herself and saving her family's finances given the mess her husband created. She didn't give up -- she busted her ass to make lemonade out of really bitter lemons (although I lost a lot of respect when it was revealed that her blogs are ghost written -- I work so hard on mine that I can't help but be a little pissed). Unfortunately, while she was climbing out of the hole she and Joe had dug for themselves, she didn't pay attention to who she was stepping on and steamrolling in the process. Teresa needs to leave Joe's butt and take the girls someplace they can all have a fresh start. Or get her own show IN ANOTHER CITY. Let her sink or swim like Bethenny Frankel.I wish each and every one of these couples the best of luck in surviving their success, so to speak. Nobody knows the motives of any couple who would willingly open their homes and lives to the kind of scrutiny these people have. I don't think it's just about fame. But I truly thank the whole cast for providing the many, many hours of mindless entertainment. I always feel better about myself after a DVR binge on them. Until next time, happy wedding planning from Weddings in Vieques and Weddings in Culebra!Sandy"
