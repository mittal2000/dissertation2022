Emerald in color and packed with loads of fresh herbs, olive oil, vinegar and garlic, it's like a cross between vinaigrette and pesto. This version -- adapted from Bon Appétit and made from a fragrant blend of parsley, mint and cilantro -- pairs beautifully with spice-rubbed beef tenderloin filets. It's the perfect dish for Father's Day or any special occasion.The nice thing about the recipe is that it's impressive, yet quick and easy to make. You can have the entire dish on the table, start to finish, in about 30 minutes. As for sides, keep it simple. I served it with sweet fresh corn, a big salad and warm bread. It would also go well with this Black Bean Salad with Corn, Red Peppers and Avocado.Begin by making the spice rub, which is a simple blend of paprika, cumin, ground mustard, kosher salt and pepper.Set that aside while you make the sauce. Start by chopping a medium shallot and a few garlic cloves. You don't need to chop them finely since they are going to get puréed, just enough so that big chunks don't get stuck in the blender.Then add the shallot and garlic to a blender, along with the olive oil, sherry wine vinegar, lemon juice, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and some of the herbs.Blend and add the remaining herbs in two separate additions until the sauce is almost smooth. Cover the sauce and refrigerate until ready to serve.When you're ready to eat, drizzle the filets with olive oil and sprinkle generously with the spice rub.Pat it down with your fingers so it sticks -- it will be a thick coating.Grill the steaks over high heat for 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare.Serve with chimichurri sauce and enjoy!

In today’s society, doing just one thing at a time seems downright luxurious, even wasteful. But chances are, you’re not doing yourself (or your boss, or your friends and family) any favors by multitasking your way through the day. Research shows that it’s not nearly as efficient as we like to believe, and can even be harmful to our health. Here are 12 reasons why you should stop everything you’re doing -- well, all but one thing -- and rethink the way you work, socialize and live your life.This article originally appeared on Health.com: ""12 Reasons To Stop Multitasking Now!"""

Dublin offers its tourists a unique view of the city by way of City of a Thousand Welcomes. Started by a local Dubliner in 2011, the program allows first-time visitors to grab a pint or a cup of tea with a local...free of charge. As the program says on its website, ""The short-term goal is to give visitors a really positive first impression of Dublin. The long-term goal is to bolster the city’s reputation as a place where ‘great hospitality’ is more than just a slogan."" While it's certainly not a new program, it's completely endearing. Remember New York's ""Just Ask a Local"" campaign from a few years back? Not as cute. Iceland has conducted similar tourism expansion projects in the past, including a 2011 campaign called ""Inspired by Iceland"" which had citizens from around the country offer up experiences to visitors and a 2012 campaign that asked people to rename the island nation. What do you think? Would you hang out with a local Dubliner upon first arriving in the city or do you find this weird? Leave it in comments. "

But not everyone has a company gym membership or a workweek that allows for morning and afternoon fitness classes. So here are six stretches that loosen the muscles made most stiff by sitting. No gym equipment or extended lunch hours required!1. Neck And Shoulders. Hunching over keyboards strains the cervical spine and stiffens our shoulders. On the next bathroom break, reach your arms behind you, and interlock your fingers so that your palms face. Lift your arms so you feel a stretch in your chest and front shoulders. Draw your chin down to avoid crunching the neck. (Of course, feel free to do this at your desk. Tell anyone who gawks to follow suit.)2. Hip Flexors And Iliopsoas. These muscle groups are at an especially high risk of tightening after long days at a desk. Here’s a morning and after-work stretch to keep ‘em lengthy. Kneel on the floor (top of the shins and feet as your base, torso straight). Pick up your left leg and place the left foot on the floor, keeping the knee directly above ankle. Keep both hips horizontally aligned as you move your torso toward the wall in front of you, gliding the knee forward. You may feel a stretch in your calf and Achilles. Place the hands on the top of the left thigh for support. Hold for 30 second. Switch sides. Repeat.More from Greatist:  29 Father's Day Gift Ideas for Your Fit Dad:  39 Deliciously Unexpected Healthy Avacado Recipes: Why Do We Care About a Donut Sandwich:  3. Abdominals. Reach your arms above you and lean slightly back so your chest and throat point towards the sky. If you have difficulty balancing, keep your gaze forward or down to the floor. Repeat on the other side.4. Obliques. From the original hip flexor stretch (low lunge, left foot forward, right knee and shin on the floor) reach your left arm to your side and touch the fingers to the floor or stack of books for support. Curve your right arm over your head reaching the right fingertips over the left side of your body. Hold for 20 seconds. Breathe. See if you can stretch a bit further, then return to a straight spine. Switch legs and repeat on the other side.5. Lower Back And Lats. Sitting for too long rounds out our spine in all the wrong places. The muscles surrounding the lumbar spine get particularly weak while the hamstrings can go slack. Lie on your stomach on the floor or on a mat. Hard version: Lift your legs off the floor. Easy version: Keep the legs on the floor. Bend your elbows and interlock your fingertips behind your neck (thumbs on either side of your neck, pointing towards your upper back). Lift your chin, look ahead. Inhale while lifting your torso as far off the floor as you can, albeit gently, by tightening the muscles along your spine. Lower down on an exhale. Repeat 10 to 15 times.Now bend your knees and sit back on your heels (tops of the feet still touching the floor). Rest your torso on your thighs and your forehead on the floor or a pillow. Reach your arms out in front of you, walk the fingertips forward and retract the shoulder blades down the back. Keep your butt on your heels as you pick up your forehead and walk your hands over to the left, then to the right to throw in a lat stretch.6. Whole Back/Spine And Hamstrings. De-stress your spine after it’s been chair-bound all day. Lie on your back, feet on the floor, knees bent. Draw both knees into the chest and gently rock. Then extend the left leg straight on the floor as you keep the right knee hugged towards the chest. Take a few breaths here and enjoy the hamstring stretch. Then, keep your right shoulder on the floor and guide the right knee across the midline of your body, towards the floor, with your left hand. It’s okay if your knee doesn’t touch the floor. Stop if you feel any pain at all. After 30 seconds, draw that knee back to center. Switch legs and repeat on the other side.Do you ever stretch in the office?

This is both for budgetary reasons and to save work for those having to view and manage the many thousands of images upstream, such as those in publicity and marketing of the film. On Training Day, because we were filming in a number of hard core neighborhoods around Los Angeles, I was actually authorized by the filmmakers to interact with and photograph the homies in such areas as South Central, Watts and East L.A., among others, for purposes of community relations and good karma. I come to be known as ""Picture Man"" and to have what one of the assistant directors refers to as a high degree of ""clout"" in the community. ""Hey Picture Man! Come take my picture!"" I frequently heard, and with which I complied. There was powerful spirit and feeling present in the air and in the streets in making this film, in this experience, sustained in large measure by the intention, professionalism and commitment of all actors, especially Denzel, Ethan, Cliff, Eva and others, by Antoine Fuqua, David Ayer, Jeff Silver, Cle Slone and really, everybody involved, and I emphasize the word involved, including all the people in all the neighborhoods. I formed one of my closest friendships in life with Salaam, a former gang-banger who did security for us and who passed away earlier this year. So many times young men, gang-bangers, approach me and tell me, ""I just want a good, honest job."" Whenever possible, I let children hold and try out my camera, and I hear their mothers saying ""You can do that job too, if you want to!"" This picture is one such instance when I asked, ""Who wants to try my camera?"" I hope that for at least some of them, a seed of possibility may have been planted, and that wherever they are now, they are OK.info@kindsightfoundation.org www.robertzuckerman.comFor more by Robert G.
