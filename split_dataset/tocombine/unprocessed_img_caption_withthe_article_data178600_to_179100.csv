The conservative host claimed that he felt singled out for mistreatment on a recent flight.""I, unlike all of the other passengers, was not offered the option of courteous service,"" Beck recounted on his program, adding -- apparently facetiously -- ""I don’t know why."" The complaint was part of a longer rant in which he discussed the myriad ways he was persecuted during a recent trip to New York City, where he and his wife were mocked by waiters at a variety of restaurants who took issue with his fringe political stances.On his flight home, Beck had another bad experience when a flight attendant ""treated [him] as a subhuman.""""My flight attendant merely barked the word 'breakfast' when he came to me,"" Beck said. ""When others were politely asked if they cared for anything to eat and given the choices, I was just barked at.""Never one to avoid a logical leap, Beck continued. ""I want to personally thank American Airlines for bringing to my attention that they don’t mean 'American Airlines. They mean 'Liberal American Airlines' apparently. "" Beck said. ""When [the flight attendant] delivered a soda, he slammed it down so hard, I hesitated to even open the can for fear that it would spray all over other passengers in the cabin. By the way, the other passengers, nobody else had to open their can. He opened it and poured it for them.""American has said it's looking into the alleged incident, reports the Star-Telegram.On the plus side, Beck apparently got a whole can of soda.The talk radio host has now entered the diverse club of notable people who have taken their scuffles with airlines public. He and Alec Baldwin may finally have found some common ground.UPDATE, 9/5: Beck has continued his attack on American Airlines for a second straight day, calling on the airline to fire the flight attendant who treated him ""like garbage,"" the Associated Press reports.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2f622000002d00fd78d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jennifer Aniston has finally found her prince, and it wasn't easy. After several failed, and very public, relationships, her boyfriend Justin Theroux, whom she had dated for 15 months prior, asked her to marry him earlier this month. And she accepted. Now clearly John Mayer, Vince Vaughn and the other men she was involved with were anything but frogs; however, they were not the right guys for her, or the answer to her finding happiness. They were, though, testimony to her willingness to break out of her comfort zone and explore different types of men. She didn't allow herself to fall into the habit of typecasting a boyfriend, repeating the same negative patterns and thinking there was only one kind of guy for her.I recently talked to one of my patients about the ending of her long-term relationship. She was in that difficult place that follows the aftermath of a break-up. She did, however, do something that she never would have done before. She was willing to take the chance of going on a blind date. Much to her surprise it went well, especially because she told me he was so different from the kind of guy she would usually consider dating. She is now in a new, exciting relationship. This reminds me of Jennifer, who remained open, rather than closing off her options, by dating various kinds of men as she searched for her dream guy.Throughout her dating, though, she held onto her vision of what she was looking for and seeking in a partner. To put it another way, she had a clear image of her prince. In 2011, she told People, ""I'm really picky. When I feel it, I feel it."" She knew he was wandering around out there somewhere, and she wasn't willing to settle. Ironically enough, she connected with him on the set of ""Wanderlust,"" a movie they were filming together. Her instincts were right on target. Because she never gave up, even when confronted with the intense betrayal and heartache she suffered along the way, she was finally able to find the soul mate she was seeking. Jennifer is a great role model for any woman who has experienced betrayal. Despite the hardships she's endured in her various relationships, she was able to learn and grow from them. She persevered and remained optimistic in the face of the heartbreak and the disappointment she sustained. She rose above public judgments thrown her way, and instead stayed true to herself, trusting her own judgment. Because she had the courage of her convictions and gave herself the room to explore, she was ultimately able to heal from her pain and find her true love.May they live happily ever after.

In the case of combating rising oil, while pinching pennies doesn't hurt, it doesn't come close to solving the problem.",2012-09-04,"FILE - In this July 10, 2012 file photo, Suzanne Meredith, of Walpole, Mass., gases up her car at a Gulf station in Brookline, Mass. Gasoline is at $3.50 per gallon for the first time this summer after a sharp run-up in July. The price of gas rose 17 cents per gallon, or 5.1 percent this month, as oil rose and drivers burned more fuel on summer road trips. It was the first monthly increase since March, and the biggest gain in any July since auto club AAA started keeping records in 2000. (AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c38362400005100531e1e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As you're undoubtedly aware, gas prices are spiking - again. And as always happens when gas prices spike, the media will soon begin gushing tired and obvious advice on ways to save.I've been watching, and participating in, this well-worn parade of stories for more than 20 years. But no more. Because while the advice offered is largely sound, it misses the point entirely. Here's the point: When it comes to gas prices, if you can't beat 'em (you can't), join 'em (you can).By way of illustration, here's an article I wrote in Dec. 8, 2010, during another gas spike. I reprint it here exactly as it was written. Check it out, then I'll give you a short update... 28 Ways to Save on Gas You Already Know - And Maybe One You Don't2012 UpdateWhile it's true that using some or all of those tired tips will help you save gas, when I wrote that article two years ago, gas was $2.95. Now it's once again approaching $4. Use as many tricks as you want - they won't keep you ahead of this game.And what's happened to ConocoPhillips?At the end of August ConocoPhillips closed at $56.55. But since I wrote the article above, Conoco spun off its Phillips 66 refining business to its existing shareholders. So in addition to the 339 shares of Conoco I now own (300 originally purchased and 39 from reinvesting dividends) I also own 167 shares of Phillips 66. Total value? $26,208: that's about $7,000, or 37 percent, more than in 2010. The lessonPersonal finance isn't about pinching pennies, it's about becoming wealthier, or at least maintaining your current wealth. In the case of combating rising oil, while pinching pennies doesn't hurt, it doesn't come close to solving the problem. Nor does rehashing 30-year old gas saving tips. Want to become wealthier? Whenever you find yourself the victim of price hikes, see if there's a way to also become a beneficiary. In this case, there is.As I said in my 2010 post, stocks are risky. If you can't afford the risk, don't take it. But if you can - even if it's just with a couple of hundred bucks - you're potentially going to go a lot farther than you will by rolling your windows up.Has this train left the station? If I thought so, I wouldn't still have 26 grand in Conoco."

Of Lice And Men IVThe way some people, upon hearing of a bank robbery or a murder, feel unaccountably guilty -- so I, as soon as Errol was sent home, felt itchy. Yet, was mine a real or a phantom infestation? Dear Reader: Here's an experiment. Close your eyes. Now focus on your scalp. To think about your scalp is to become aware of an array of sensations -- tingling or sparkling, darting -- any one of which might be the mark or footprint of a louse. Or not.  I started to scratch. I scratched casually, at first. Then continually, then obsessively, then insanely. Convinced I had them, too, I cancelled everything. I put an X across all our plans. I deleted our days. Errol stayed home, reading, watching and itching. Our isolation and hysteria grew. At some point, I started to itch for real. Our lives became misery, drudgery and laundry cycles. Yet as a misguided toenail grows inward and thrives, so, Dear Reader, did we. Errol had his books. That spring he read Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain and Prey. And he had the DVR. Some afternoons, he would just sit and itch and watch The Simpsons. He was isolated but not un-entertained. I had my writing work, a project for a London museum -- and my eye on a guy on the Internet. His eHarmony picture showed him on a tennis court of green clay, focused on a ball and swinging. I like tennis. I play tennis. He was in shorts. I studied his legs, they were hairy and well-shaped. After some cyber-winking and whatnot -- the exchange of a few witty, well-polished sentences -- he asked for my number and I gave it. I heard from him almost immediately: the interjection of his voice in my daily life was a small shock. He was keen to meet me only he was about to go away on business. Was I free the following day? I was aghast at the suddenness. I wasn't ready! and said no. A phone courtship commenced. ""I can tell from your voice that you're intelligent, elegant,"" he said. I did not feel intelligent as I stripped beds every morning. I felt more desperate than elegant as I flung my pillow in the dark, convinced it was a lice haven. I did not feel elegant as I sat at my computer rubbing my eyebrows. I imagined lice dangling from my eyelashes, and pouring from my eye sockets and that's not elegant. Still, it was a nice thought. Most diverting.   He called me as he was being driven to the airport and called again from Canada. Business was boring -- detailed presentations and manufacturing challenges. But Banff was beautiful. I would certainly like Banff he said. I should look up Banff on the web he said. It was a pity, he said, that I was not there -- enjoying the spa and massages in the room while he endured dull meetings. Dear Reader, I had never met the man yet I found myself wishing I was with him in Banff. Was it wrong to long for a break in the battle against lice?****"
7,DIVORCE,What My Students' Families Taught Me About Divorce and Co-Parenting,"Danielle Greco, Contributor
Blogger, 52 Brand New",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/co-parenting_us_5b9c31a0e4b03a1dcc7cfd6e,"After seeing so many students struggle, this teacher learned a lesson about co-parenting peacefully.",2012-09-03,Rear view of pupils raising arms during the lesson with teacher looking at them,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c31a02200005600d92582.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I taught elementary school for 10 years before becoming a stay-at-home mom. One thing I observed during my years in the classroom is that the way parents divorce and co-parent has a profound effect on their children's academic and emotional behavior. So when my husband and I divorced, I used what I learned from my students and their parents in executing our settlement, writing our custody agreement and co-parenting our children.During my early years of teaching, I taught a third grader who lived with each of his parents 50 percent of the time. Gavin stayed with one parent Monday through Wednesday and the other parent from Thursday to Sunday. They would alternate this schedule weekly and frequently adjust it to accommodate their business travel plans. While Gavin seemed to have loving parents, this schedule caused the boy so much anxiety that it interfered with his schoolwork. He would break down toward the end of the day because he could not remember if he was going to the after school program or if his mother was coming to pick him up. Occasionally, his parents forgot too, and the wrong parent would arrive or forget to show up on a given day. His parents had two sets of all of his belongings, right down to duplicate backpacks. The problem was that Gavin often left his homework or necessary supplies at the other parent's house and would come to school in tears. While this type of custody arrangement may work for some families, it certainly did not work for his.At least Gavin had parents who seemed to be amicable toward each other. Robert, a fourth grader I taught, had parents who could not be in the same room together without fighting. During back-to-school night, Robert's father asked a question as I gave my presentation. Robert's mother wrinkled her nose and stuck out her tongue at him in front of a room full of parents. While I was shocked at her display of immaturity, I was hardly surprised when Robert had difficulty getting along with his classmates and respecting authority. His parents were not role models of appropriate social behavior at all.Several times during my teaching career, I have taught children whose parents were in the midst of a divorce. Amelia, a fourth grader, showed some of the classic signs of emotional distress before I even knew what was going on at home. Her grades slipped, she forgot numerous homework assignments and became tearful in the middle of the day. When I met with her to discuss her academic issues, Amelia confided that her parents were divorcing because of her father's infidelity. She told me that her mother told her, ""All men cheat. That's just the way they are."" Expressing her beliefs may have made Amelia's mother feel better, but I wonder if she considered how a statement like that might affect Amelia's future relationships. At a time when children's lives are being turned upside down, they need their parents to comfort them. It should not be the other way around.As my divorce became imminent, I knew I wouldn't act immaturely like Robert's parents or use my children as confidants like Amelia's mother did. While I wanted my children to spend time with both of their parents, it didn't seem fair to have them bounce from house to house like Gavin. I resolved to have a divorce that was more like Jacob's parents. Jacob, a second grader, was an outgoing and well-liked child. He worked hard and his grades were above average. I met his divorced parents for the first time at our parent-teacher conference. They arrived together and acted friendly toward one another. When I told them how much Jacob enjoyed learning about space, they set a date to take him to the planetarium together. My divorce was emotionally devastating, but after seeing so many of my students deal with family issues, I knew I needed to navigate the process carefully for the sake of my children. Even though I felt hurt, angry and betrayed, I suggested that my husband and I use a mediator to handle our divorce with as little conflict as possible. We worked out a parenting schedule that is fair to both parents and puts our children's needs first. My ex-husband and I co-parent by communicating civilly on an almost-daily basis. Is it difficult to do so? Yes. Is it worth it? Yes. When I consider how important my relationship with my ex-husband is to my children's well-being, I know our peaceful, friendly interaction is worth the effort. We are far from perfect, but I'm proud of the way my ex-husband and I co-parent. After seeing so many students struggle, this teacher learned a lesson about co-parenting peacefully. *All students' names have been changed"
