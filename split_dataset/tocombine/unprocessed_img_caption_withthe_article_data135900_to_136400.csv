Nikhil AroraNikhil Arora and Alejandro Velez of Back to the Roots have done just that -- twice. They perfected the art of mini mushroom farming, and then applied their technique to aquaponics. The idea originated after a presentation in their Berkeley seminar class. ""The professor said something about growing mushrooms with coffee grounds, and we both asked him about it after class. He put us in touch, and we fed the idea from there.""This inspired the boys to spend their senior year lugging large sacks of coffee grounds into the back room of Alejandro's fraternity, where they experimented with different strands and farming techniques. ""The other guys in the house, many of whom had never before cared about the environment, all of a sudden started complaining the amount of electricity we were using for our mushrooms.""Needless to say, not everyone believed in these boys and their crops from the beginning.After graduation, they turned down investment banking and consulting to pursue the field of fungus, and began selling at farmer's markets in Oakland. Their product was a hit, and at height of sales, they were distributing more than 500 pounds of mushrooms per week. Then, they came up with the kit, and soon after, their product found a shelf.  ""The first time we pitched to Whole Foods, they were like, 'Get this disgusting thing out of here!' We were quick to find it's all about presentation.""After a few modifications, the Whole Foods in Berkeley accepted, and that carved the path for their current partnerships: Whole Foods, Nordstrom, Home Depot, and Fresh Market. To date, Arora and Velez have sold more than 300,000 mushroom kits.""Our goal -- we want to change the face of home farming. Through beautiful design to ease of use, we want to bring the idea beyond the Berkeley hippie stereotype to the mainstream. We want to build a brand that makes our product accessible to everyone, and sell in stores from Toys R Us to Home Depot."" After locking down the mini mushroom market, Nikhil and Alejandro applied their sleek, simple design to aquaponics with the AquaFarm--a self-sustaining ecosystem where the plants feed the beta fish, and its waste feeds the plants.  (Photography by Back to the Roots)""We put the idea on Kickstarter with $100k goal. We ended up with $248k, and more feedback and buzz than we could ever hope for.""Nikhil describes how he was originally fearful of sharing the AquaFarm on Kickstarter, as others would replicate, but the comments provided by supporters fundamentally changed--improved--his product. Back to the Roots postponed the aquaponics launch from April to June in order to implement all of the Kickstarter critiques.""If it's new and innovative, people will try and replicate it. Now, it seems there's a new one out every month. It's just motivation to keep improving, and to be first in the market."" It's all about doing one thing, and doing it right. Today, Nikhil and Alejandro are selling in over 2,000 retailers nationwide. Though they've created a consumer product, Arora and Velez realize their success holds obligations to do good. Through a partnership with Revolution Foods of Oakland, with each AquaFarm sold, customers can vote online for an elementary school of their choice to receive a free serving of veggies.""It's not about the what of the product -- it's about the why.""As far as the future, Alejandro and Nikhil plan to continue developing fun and inspiring ways for families to connect to their food, and to continue making change through business.Special discount code for readers: 10 percent off and free shipping when use HuffPoGrows10Special thanks to Maya Horgan for helping research, write, and edit this story.

5,TRAVEL,10 Reasons You Should Take A Gap Year,Suzy Strutner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gap-year_us_5b9dad7fe4b03a1dcc8b4f13,10. You’ll make new friends. How cool would it be to go through life knowing you have a best friend in Italy or a pen pal,2013-11-30,cheering woman hiker open arms at mountain peak cliff,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dad7f2200005600d9b964.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With the recent news that Malia Obama will take a gap year before her freshman year at Harvard, the world will surely watch with anticipation to learn how she will spend the 365 days between high school and college.While it's not common in the U.S., taking a gap year is considered the norm in some countries all over the world, including the United Kingdom and Australia. Many colleges and universities in the U.S. not only accept applicants who choose to take gap years, but also actively encourage enrolled students to study abroad during their college tenures. According to study abroad organization CIEE, Harvard College has seen a 33 percent increase in the number of their incoming students taking gap years.That might be due, in part, to the school's acceptance letters. According to U.S. News & World Report, acceptance letters from Harvard even suggest that students might want to take time off before they enroll. Taking a gap year between high school and college can be tremendously beneficial to one's personal growth, whether one decides on enrolling in a structured gap year program, spend time volunteering abroad or simply traveling the world. Regardless, taking a gap year means that you're living life to the fullest. Here are 10 reasons why.1. You’ll perform better in college. Students might worry that college admissions officials or professors will look down on them for taking a gap year. This isn’t true: many schools report that gap year students have higher GPAs and are more involved on campus, so their attitudes toward gap years are far from unfavorable. 2. You’ll realize what you love before you start studying. More often than not, college students commit themselves to one area of study, realize it’s not for them, and then swap to a completely different major… often two or three times. You’ll cut down on coursework, tuition bills and stress if you take time before college to decide how you want to spend your academic experience before you get there.3. You’ll get to adventure at your prime. When else are you going to be 18 years old with no job, no mortgage payments, no significant other, no kids, no homework and no worries? Never. The answer is never.4. You’ll know what’s important in life before most people do.  College is ridiculously fun, but it’s easy to get so caught up that you begin to believe your fraternity or friend group is the absolute center of the universe. As such, any small crisis might seem like the end of the world. However, if you’ve traveled the wider world in all its complexity and glory, you’ll understand there are bigger issues for humanity than a failed date night or lost game of beer pong. 5. You’ll be an expert at adapting to new places. On a gap year, you’ll be forced to integrate into a new society, a new group of friends, and maybe even new languages or cultural norms. College requires similar adaptation skills, and you’ll be much more ready to handle it if you’ve already shifted societies once before.6. You’ll have something to talk about. Skip the same old “where are you from?” and “what’s your major?” chitchat, and nail the “what’d you do this summer?” question with stories from your gap year. You’ll have first-hand opinions to share about people, places and ideas that your peers might have never even heard of.7. You’ll have a shinier resume. Oftentimes, a gap year involves staying in one spot and soaking up its culture, part of which means getting a job. No matter where you work -- a sandwich stand in India or the embassy in London -- you’ll have valuable (international!) experience for your resume and can explain your ability to do business with customers from different cultures. If you travel on the cheap, you might even have some earnings left to use on college tuition. 8. You’ll pick up the pieces you missed in high school.  Slept through every Spanish class? Head to Argentina for your gap year, where you'll be forced to speak the language every day. Wish you knew more history? Spend time touring government buildings in Europe. A gap year is your time to refine the specific skills you feel like you’re lacking and sharpen them up for college.9. You’ll have time to think. Life feels like it’s unfolding fast right now, and in college, things only move faster. Give yourself room to think and breathe and be on long train rides from country to country or in days spent strolling through new towns. You’ll be surprised where your mind wanders when you give it free rein. 10. You’ll make new friends. How cool would it be to go through life knowing you have a best friend in Italy or a pen pal in New Zealand? Their unique perspectives on life will hugely enrich yours as you compare all the major events that happen in your 20s and beyond. Plus, you’ll have crazy awesome places to visit during college breaks."

Recently, researchers found that even though cats can differentiate between their owner's voice and that of a stranger, they possess more of a “don’t care” attitude when it comes to responding. In other words, the furry felines can definitely hear you; they just don't care enough to acknowledge you. “Historically speaking, cats, unlike dogs, have not been domesticated to obey humans’ orders,"" the study notes. ""Rather, they seem to take the initiative in human–cat interaction.” The study was published in the Animal Cognition journal in July, but the research recently fell into the spotlight earlier this week when it was picked up by Reddit.For the study, researchers observed 20 domesticated cats in their homes for eight months to monitor how the pets recognize and respond to human voices that call out their names. In the end, when they heard a human calling, 50 to 70 percent of the cats turned their heads and 30 percent moved their ears -- typical reactions to hearing any sound. Only 10 percent responded to being called, either by meowing or moving their tails, the study said. These response rates were about the same whether the cat was being called by strangers or by an owner. But the cats did have a more intense response to their owner's voice. So while cats may seem aloof, they may have a special relationship with their owner, the study's authors told Discovery News back in June. ""Previous studies suggest that cats have evolved to behave like kittens (around their owners), and humans treat cats similar to the way that they treat babies,"" study co-author Kazutaka Shinozuka, of the University of South Florida College of Medicine, told the outlet. ""To form such baby-parent like relationships, recognition of owners might be important for cats.""Albeit, the study concludes by noting that, “the behavioral aspect of cats that cause their owners to become attached to them are still undetermined.”Maybe it’s all that “tough” love that has owners pining for affection.
