And if they're not happy, who is happy?"" D'Amour was told she was too",2013-11-15,On the runway for John Galliano's Spring/Summer 2006 ready-to-wear show,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9da9d32200008300d9b813.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"The recent push to include more realistic, diverse body shapes in the modeling industry has focused on the message that models' images send to female shoppers and readers. When regular women are inundated with a narrow, ultra-skinny body standard across the media, it can have damaging and widespread effects. But plus-size model Velvet D'Amour points out that the unrealistic body standard affects another group: the models themselves. Speaking about her professional journey, D'Amour told Bustle in a new interview: ""The women we hold as icons of beauty are not happy. And if they're not happy, who is happy?"" D'Amour was told she was too heavy from the very start of her career. Getting started in the 1980s and weighing 140 pounds, she was pushed to change almost immediately. ""At the time everyone was completely coked up and maybe 99 pounds,"" she told Bustle. ""So I went down to 117 and they said I was still too fat.""Fellow model Crystal Renn has also opened up about her struggle in the face of fashion's unrealistic standards. Her own push to reach that elusive target weight early in her modeling career drove her into an eating disorder and incredible unhappiness. The day she decided to stop trying to reach at unattainable ""perfect"" body, she once told Interview, ""I felt fantastic."" Even non-plus-size models, those who from the outside appear to have reached that perfect body shape, are often unsatisfied. ""Models are some of the most insecure people I've ever met,"" Miranda Kerr said recently. Christie Brinkley admitted that even at the peak of her career, she remembers ""feeling very fat"" when posing for photo shoots. The wildly unrealistic body standard across the modeling industry not only damages the regular women who are bombarded by the images every day (and and we know for a fact that it is damaging). It also damages the women in the photos. And, as D'Amour put it, if those women aren't happy, it's not looking good for the rest of us. Hopefully the presence of outspoken models is a step in the right direction. Read more from her interview at Bustle.com and check out her runway work in the pics below.Want more?

""There was a song called 'By the Grace of God' which paints a picture about how low I was… feeling like I wasn’t enough, it wasn’t possible for me to be loved."" So how did the ""Roar"" singer rise above those feelings? ""From a lot of searching for help… through a lot of changing how I think about myself,"" she says. ""On this record, there’s a song called 'Love Me' which is a song about loving yourself first in order to be loved properly."" Perry -- who reportedly found out Brand wanted out of their marriage via text message -- has spoken about the hard times that followed the divorce before. Back in October, the pop star told the UK's Sunday Times that the initial shock of the split left her in bed for almost two weeks. ""I was pretty f--ked,"" she said. ""It hurt a lot -- I got a good knock."" Keep in touch! Check out HuffPost Divorce on Facebook and Twitter."
2,DIVORCE,Your Yearbook Photo May Predict Your Likelihood Of Divorce,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/predict-divorce_us_5b9da982e4b03a1dcc8b01c5,How can something as seemingly insignificant as your smile in childhood photos predict so much about your future?

Your choice may be more telling than you realize; According to recent research, your smile, or lackthereof, in photos from your youth may predict your likelihood of divorce later in life. In his new book, The Tell: The Little Clues That Reveal Big Truths about Who We Are, DePauw University psychology professor Matthew Hertenstein digs deeper into his 2009 study that revealed that people who smiled widely were more likely to have lasting marriages than those who smiled weakly, or not at all, in their childhood photos. Hertenstein and his team examined several hundred college yearbook photos to gauge how intensely people smiled. Subjects with an intense smile contracted both the muscles that elevate the cheeks and the muscles that make the eyes ""smile,"" too -- the orbicularis oculi muscles. The team then asked the subjects, ranging in age from their early twenties to their late eighties, if they had divorced. The big reveal? Those who smiled the least in their yearbook photos were five times more likely to divorce at some point in their lives compared to those who smiled the most.How can something as seemingly insignificant as your smile in childhood photos predict so much about your future?""Perhaps people who smile in their photos are simply being more compliant when the photographer says, 'Cheese.' It may be that this level of obedience is the glue that keeps some marriages together,"" Hertenstein writes in The Tell. ""The explanation with the most support, is that people who smile in their photographs have a more positive disposition and more extensive social network. When life throws us inevitable curveballs, those with a positive emotional disposition and strong social support tend to thrive.""

3,WELLNESS,Why It's Incredibly Important To Learn To Laugh At Yourself,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-successful-people-who_us_5b9da856e4b03a1dcc8aefcd,"""If you can laugh at yourself, you can forgive yourself,"" Susan Sparks, author of ""Laugh Your Way To Grace,"" writes in a",2013-11-14,"HOLLYWOOD, CA - FEBRUARY 24: Actress Jennifer Lawrence reacts after winning the Best Actress award for 'Silver Linings Playbook' during the Oscars held at the Dolby Theatre on February 24, 2013 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9da8561f00002d0021b3f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most of us know from experience that having a sense of humor about things can make life a little easier.And there's science to back that up: Being able to laugh at yourself may be a sign of an optimistic personality and a sense of humor, according to a small 2011 study, and it might even improve your mood. Humor has also been identified as a possible factor in the development of personal resilience. ""If you can laugh at yourself, you can forgive yourself,"" Susan Sparks, author of ""Laugh Your Way To Grace,"" writes in a Psychology Today blog post. ""And if you can forgive yourself, you can forgive others.""These nine people prove that the best way to deal with many of life's challenges is to simply laugh at yourself. Bill ClintonBill Clinton has had his fair share of health challenges: The former McDonald's-loving president struggled with heart disease and underwent quadruple-bypass surgery in 2004, but he's still been able to maintain a sense of humor about his health. When asked about his favorite cocktail at a 2010 Gridiron Club dinner, Clinton responded that his beverage of choice was ""Lipitor on the rocks"" (in reference to the cholesterol-lowering medication), Fox News reported. Clinton may joke about his cholesterol levels, but he's also serious about the value of healthy eating, and has spoken out about his vegan diet.""You have to make a conscious decision to change for your own well-being, that of your family and your country,"" he told AARP in July. Elizabeth GilbertElizabeth Gilbert's mega-selling 2006 memoir ""Eat, Pray, Love"" flew off bookstore shelves, and landed an $80 million-grossing rom-com starring Julia Roberts. But critics had a less enthusiastic response to the book -- as the New York Times put it, ""critics cast her as a pampered solipsist peddling self-help."" And the movie's generally poor (and sometimes scathing) reviews didn't help matters. But Gilbert didn't take the criticisms to heart, maintaining a sense of humor about the ""Eat, Pray, Love"" frenzy as she released her next book in 2010. “I threw it out into the world like a grenade,"" Gilbert said in a New York Times interview, joking about the release of ""Committed"" following ""Eat, Pray, Love."" ""I was like, ‘All right, everybody, whatever you have to say about the last book, whatever resentment you’ve built up over the last few years, let’s just catharsis it out and move on.’ And it did that.”MadonnaIn her long and legendary career, Madonna has made her share of mistakes and received plenty of criticism. But one of her secrets to longevity in the limelight -- she has, after all, been in show business for more 30 years -- might just be her ability to take it all in stride and just keep going. “I laugh at myself,"" Madonna once said. ""I don't take myself completely seriously. I think that's another quality that people have to hold on to ... you have to laugh, especially at yourself.” Barack Obama The President was the butt of his own jokes at this year's White House Correspondents Dinner. He riffed off of accusations about his background (""These days I look in the mirror and I have to admit, I'm not the strapping young muslim socialist I used to be""), and joked, ""Rush Limbaugh warned you about this. Second term, baby!""Mark ZuckerbergJoining a long history of Saturday Night Live self-mockery, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared on the sketch TV show in 2011 to ""poke"" a little fun at his reputation for arrogance. Zuckerberg appeared alongside Jesse Eisenberg, who played him in The Social Network, and made the character come off as fairly self-important and ego-maniacal.""Why can't I go in there? I'm the real Mark Zuckerberg!"" Zuckerberg said as the cameras panned backstage. ""Come on. I invented Poking!""Hillary ClintonClinton knows that her famous pantsuits are often joked about, and she's taken to joining in on the fun. As New York Magazine noted, she has a long history of laughing at herself (and her style). ""I am going to be pitching Andy and others on a new show for Bravo, to fill that gap that is so apparent to some of us,"" Clinton joked at this year's CFDA Awards. ""All you really need is a small but passionate audience to be successful. We could call it Project Pantsuit.""James FrancoActor/renaissance man James Franco got a lot of flack for his lackluster (to put it lightly) performance hosting the Oscars in 2011 with Anne Hathaway (CNN called the duo two of the worst Oscar hosts of all time). Franco met his Oscars karma in September at his Comedy Central roast, when he faced what Rolling Stone called a ""comedic firing squad.""""Everyone is gonna make fun of James Franco for the Oscars, it's obvious,"" Jonah Hill said. ""Everyone was saying James was dead up there! But I think that was Anne Hathaway's fault. I mean, f*ck her for trying, like, at all!""But Franco took it all in stride. ""This is truly my punishment for the Oscars,"" he laughed. Cat PowerChan Marshall (aka Cat Power) has become known for being a sensitive artsy type who often has on-stage meltdowns. In a hilarious Funny or Die skit, Marshall played the tortured-artist stereotype to a tee. Performing to a classroom full of second-grade children, she gets offended by the kids' ""hand dancing,"" feels judged by their stares, and eventually lets all her emotions out (""I'm baring my soul ... Life is hard and it gets worse and worse and worse."")""This lady makes me sad,"" one little girl says.Jennifer Lawrence J-Law may just be the queen of making fun of herself, and she's beloved for precisely that quality. Lawrence recently told Jimmy Kimmel that she has ""uneven breasts"" and has compared her dancing skills to a ""dad at prom,"" but her ultimate moment of self-mockery was at this year's Oscars. When the ""Silver Linings Playbook"" star tripped on the way up to receive her Oscar for Best Actress and then made fun of herself in her acceptance speech, she won over the audience. ""You guys are just standing up because I fell and it's embarrassing, but thank you,"" Lawrence laughed during her speech. When later asked what was going through her mind when she tripped, she joked, ""A bad word that I can't say ... that starts with 'F.'"" "
