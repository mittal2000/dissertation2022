But that was about it. Never did it cross my mind that the seemingly normal act of texting an authentic boyfriend might actually warp or ruin a genuine romantic relationship.Hear me out. I have a theory.Recently a friend of my daughter's told me that her boyfriend ""wanted a break."" Since I write young adult novels for a living and aspire to be known as ""The Cool Mom,"" I said, ""Sit down, honey. Have an iced tea and tell me what happened.""You see in the case of this particular girl, I was confused. She wasn't one of those needy girls. She was strong and independent. Her boyfriend was too. This pair of lovebirds weren't the stereotypical glued-at-the-hip kind of couple. Both had very active social lives, apart from their relationship, and both admitted to still being very much infatuated. So, if there wasn't another girl in the picture, why the break?The girl had no idea.""Is he still texting you?"" I asked.""Yes Ma'am."" (We live in the South.)""Like all the time?""""Yes Ma'am.""And then I asked the key question -- one I thought I understood, but apparently did not. ""Explain this texting thing to me."" ""It's like a tennis ball,"" she replied. ""He texts, and then I text back, and it goes on like this all the time. Back and forth. Back and forth.""""Can you elaborate?"" Surely she couldn't mean ALL the time. What the heck were they talking about?She shrugged. ""Well, today he said something about his class. And then I sent him a pic from volleyball practice and then he asked me a question about it. And I replied.""""But then it should stop, right? After you answered his question?""""Well, no. Because then it's his turn."" ""But the conversation was over,"" I pointed out.""The conversation is never over... "" she repeated, emphasis on ""never.""The problem was becoming clear, and I jumped in with a diagnosis. ""I can't even fathom being forced to talk to my husband, my mother, or even my best friend every day like that! No wonder the guy needs a break. He's sick of you.""That might have been a little harsh, I admit. Tears began to fall.So I concurred that texting is fun and exciting at the start. Heck. Nothing ignites those butterflies better. And Lord knows those first few weeks of texts can turn a girl to mush. Oh, the nights of late night texting marathons where you tell each other everything under the sun. I get it.  ""All the same,"" I added, ""I love pecan pie like the rest of the gals, but too much sugar will make you sick.""She winced.""That poor boy has no space,"" I explained. ""Think about it. You're TOO available. He doesn't have time to miss you or wonder what you're doing or wish he could be with you because he already IS with you. You live in his pocket for Pete's sake. This constant texting has burned out the relationship. Killed the allure. Why would he want to come to your house and watch a movie or hang out after school when he feels like he's 'with you' all the time?""She got real quiet and I feared more tears, so I offered my prescription. ""Look. Texting is an addictive behavior. I've googled it. So I know that you two are addicted to a bad habit. All you need to do is quit texting him for a few days, or even a few hours and he'll be over this break real quick.""Tah dah! I was right. He was at her locker the next day before sixth period.But since I'm the hen in a house full of chicks, I can only speak about what I see from inside the coop, but I imagine the same is true from a male perspective. I've certainly seen it again and again on this side of the fence -- the ruin of a perfectly good match due to the constant contact generated by texting. Even stranger is when these couples really DO break up but still can't stop texting each other. Not to mention the problem of one or both of the parties preferring to discuss the more serious issues in their relationships via text instead of in person because it's easier.Another mother told me about her teen whose courtship became almost ""textophrenic."" There was the attraction the girl had to the sweet guy she dated in real life and then the not-so-attractive union she had with his snarky, impatient ""twin"" whose texts were almost brotherly and sometimes crude, an all day let's-poke-fun-at-each-other kind of bond. Her attempt to manage the two sides of the relationship was confusing, not to mention exhausting.And while we're on the subject, let's discuss Apple's ""Read Receipts."" This is a feature on the iPhone that allows the parties to be able to tell the exact minute their texts have been read. So, for a teenager, if he or she hasn't received a reply in t-minus two seconds, something must be wrong. As a favor, I once held my daughter's phone while a series of texts from a friend came in. Being the curious novelist that I am, I read, but didn't reply because, well, I wasn't my daughter. But I watched while the friend started to frantically text a string of paranoia that went something like this:Hello?!I know you're reading this.So you're not gonna answer?Nice. You suck.The friend could clearly see that I was reading her texts because my daughter's phone was sending her ""read receipts"" telling her that the texts had been seen. But because I wasn't replying, she thought that my daughter was mad at her. Needless to say I battened down the hatches and instigated an intervention STAT. Numero Uno? NO MORE READ RECEIPTS.These kids know where everyone is at every moment of the day. Remember when you used to wonder if the cute boy was going to be at the hangout and you got all dolled up and excited in anticipation? That's a thing of the past. These kids know who's there before they ever leave their house because they are actively participating in dozens of group conversations at the same time. It's like standing in the center of seven cocktail parties at once!Bottom line: Our children need a break. But what should we do? And how do we convince them of the dangers of something that has become so central to their existence? I wasn't sure. But then fate stepped in to help when I suddenly had cause to punish my eldest.""I'm taking your phone away,"" I declared.Her face went ashen. ""But I'm scared to drive without it. I mean what if I have an accident or run out of gas or something?""I felt my face warm. She had a point. I'm just as attached to her having the stupid thing as she is to having it.""You'll be fine,"" I assured her, but I wasn't convinced.An hour later, she appeared at the kitchen door slumped in boredom and announced she was going to a neighbor boy's house. ""And after that, I might even go to another one's.""I perked up. ""Yes! Human interaction. You go, girl! Visit a bunch of the neighbors!""When she returned, she climbed up into my bed and told me she'd had a good afternoon chilling with her friends and one's whole family. We decided to swing back by a little later and ended up being invited to stay for dinner.""I am so thankful you took your daughter's phone away today!"" the mother gushed, her children horrified. ""Do you realize that we would have never gotten to hang out or have dinner like this if that sleek little rectangle had remained affixed to her palm?  We laughed and realized it was true. Had my sweet girl had access to her phone, she wouldn't have made time to be with this boy that day. And yet, here we all were together, interacting over a shared summer supper.Wake up, people. This needless incessant phone-to-phone contact is ruining relationships and not just romantic ones. As for the Anderson girls, we are at least talking about it. And that's a good start. In fact, much to my delight, one of my daughter's friends proofed this article, then shared a similar story.""The other day my boyfriend and I texted each other all class period long. But when we saw each other afterwards it was weirdly awkward because we had nothing to say."" She paused. ""Like nothing.""""What if all of this texting stuff develops into some sort of cyber reality?'"" We chuckled. ""Like what if we lose the ability to talk apart from a cell phone?"" she suggested.""Without human interaction life would get very boring,"" I later concluded with my daughter. And this time, I knew she understood.By the way, when her phone was returned a mere 24 hours later, she had missed 306 texts... Lawsy. It's going to take a village.Also on HuffPost:"

So I decided to experiment and see if I could come up with a way for the delicious morsels to retain a crisp edge.The obvious way to go was to try different kinds of flours to coat the fries. Regular all-purpose flour made the sweet potatoes too dry, and so did semolina. Corn flour made them too heavy. Rice flour yielded better results, but it made the fries brown too fast. I finally turned to chickpea flour... and to my delight, the fries were fabulous! The delicate chickpea flour gave just enough coating to prevent the fries from softening up, but didn't weigh them down or dry them up.The other factor that needed a bit of experimenting was the size of the fries themselves.

Our ""Sacred Spaces"" series explores where your phone is unwelcome. From the mundane to the truly unique -- from yoga class to family dinner to your bath tub -- we are spotlighting the environments where you are truly unplugged. Want to share your own? Send us your story here.During the summer months, I try to work from home as much as possible and be with my kids. But I've noticed some changes in the behavior of my budding toddler, now 21 months old. She's been more aggressive, frustrated, and well... just not as happy. She could be just growing up, or trying to communicate, but irritated that she can't form the words yet. Or she could be trying to get my attention. I've also observed her constantly going after my phone... or pretending everything she picked up was a phone -- and saying ""ello?"" It was like a light bulb went on when I realized, hmmm, maybe I should put my phone away. Like now.So I have, cold turkey. And the results have been pretty substantial and a little surprising. Enjoying an early morning hike with my daughter in Breckenridge, Colo. this summer. Peek-a-boo! (Ironically, captured this image on my iPhone)Now let's not get crazy, I still use my iPhone as soon as I wake up to check email, Twitter, Blogger and Facebook. I also try to send out all of my emails before my kids wake up, which isn't always possible... because I'm exhausted. I (try to) wake up a full hour before the littlest one to get in a work out on the elliptical, while I type away furiously on my iPad. Multitasking at its best! But once I drop my 4-year-old daughter off at preschool and return home, I've started to put my phone back in the master bedroom from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. This enables me to fully be present with my toddler.What do we do on these non-working mommy days? Go to the park with friends, go for a walk, do puzzles, an art project, or chores, go to a baby class, and sometimes (like today) run errands. I've noticed a big change in her in the past two weeks. She's less attention-seeking and more focused. She's thriving with some new skills -- cutting and pasting, for example -- and learning new words like ""crazy."" Prior to this, I noticed boredom, hitting, throwing, and sometimes even biting. Now that I'm not on the phone constantly, or texting, or completely distracted with work, she is getting the attention and praise she needs. She's receiving more attention, conversation from me, and more one-on-one interaction. Isn't this what all kids need? I believe this has had a huge influence on her behavior... or maybe she's just getting older. Most likely, it's both.Emylia enjoying our porch swing this morningI also have started to put the phone away from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. as well, when my oldest gets home from preschool. It's not 100 percent of the time, but most days I try my best to give them both my undivided attention. We sculpt masterpieces with Play-Doh, swim, feed the ducks, and swing on the swing set. I've also purchased them both aprons and kitchen stools so they can help me prep dinner, rather than just turning on Nick Jr. I'm even thinking of telling my employers to call between the nap time hours of 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. on days I'm home, or if they really need me to call my home phone. It's so incredibly tough to juggle my freelance work and the kids... and I totally don't want to miss out on any other work opportunities. But I've found that so far, as long as I check my email and texts in the mornings, and by 1 p.m., I'm usually not missing anything urgent.After nap time today, I ran with my girls over to the local children's museum Young At Art in Davie, Fla. It was amazing to see all the kids playing and having fun... and the parents sitting on the side scrolling through their phones. I observed only one or two parents out of 10 or so there actually playing with their kids. Raise your hand if you've done this. Yeah, me too! I mean we need a break, and the kids ARE having fun. But it was interesting that the children causing problems -- pushing my daughter off the slide, or not sharing -- were the ones whose parents were on their phones. They were completely distracted and unaware their child was causing harm to another.I recently stumbled upon Brooke Burke's website www.modernmom.com and found this wonderful blog post titled ""Take Time to Stop and Smell the Flowers"" by Danielle Simmons. If you have a moment, please read it. It was a lovely reminder of how precious this time is with our little ones. It also made me realize how putting my phone away was my first step to being present with them, and I didn't even know it."
