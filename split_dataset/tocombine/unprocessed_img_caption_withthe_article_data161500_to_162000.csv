In a government report released Tuesday, Feb. 7, 2012, that includes a list of the top 10 sources of sodium. Salty snacks actually came in at the bottom of the list compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention while bread and rolls are the No. 1 source of salt in the American diet, accounting for more than twice as much sodium as salty junk food like potato chips. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce5d124000050005360d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO, March 6 (Reuters) - Increased salt consumption may be a key culprit behind rising rates of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, researchers reported on Wednesday in a trio of papers looking at the role of a specific class of cells linked with inflammation.Reporting in the journal Nature, the researchers said high-salt diets increased levels of a type of immune cell linked with autoimmune disease. And mice genetically engineered to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) got much worse when they ate what amounted to a high-salt Western diet compared with mice who had more moderate salt intake.The findings suggest that salt may play a previously unknown role in triggering autoimmune diseases such as MS or type 1 diabetes in individuals who are already genetically predisposed.""It's not bad genes. It's not bad environment. It's a bad interaction between genes and the environment,"" said Dr. David Hafler, a professor of immunobiology at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and senior author of one of the three papers.High salt intake is already a known culprit in increasing the risk of heart disease and hypertension. The new study now implicates high-salt diets in increasing rates of autoimmune disease. ""It can't be just salt. We know vitamin D probably plays a small component. We know smoking is a risk factor. This now suggests that salt is also a risk factor,"" Hafler said.""How much? We don't know,"" he added.Hafler became interested in studying the link between salt and autoimmunity through studies of the gut microbiome - a census of gut microbes and cell function of 100 healthy individuals.The team noticed that when people in the study visited fast food restaurants more than once a week, they saw a marked increase in levels of destructive inflammatory cells, which the immune system produces to respond to injury or foreign invaders, but which attack healthy tissues in autoimmune diseases.He shared these findings with colleagues at Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and others who were working out what factors induce the activity of a type of autoimmune cell known as a T helper 17 or a Th17 cell.Th17 cells can promote inflammation that is important for defending against pathogens, but they have also been linked to diseases like multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Treatment options for some of these diseases, such as psoriasis, include manipulating T cell function.""The question we wanted to pursue was: How does this highly pathogenic, pro-inflammatory T cell develop?"" said Vijay Kuchroo of the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital and a member of the Broad Institute.""Once we have a more nuanced understanding of the development of the pathogenic Th17 cells, we may be able to pursue ways to regulate them or their function.""Hafler said Kuchroo's team worked on tracing how these immune cells were wired, and what triggered their development. They identified a specific gene known as SGK1 that plays an important role in the cells' development. This gene had not been seen in T cells before, but it has been known to play a role in absorbing salt in the gut and kidneys.""We put the two together and went after this,"" Hafler said.Researchers at Harvard and Yale and colleagues in Germany led by Dominik Mueller looked to see whether a high-salt diet could induce the destructive immune system response that is the hallmark of autoimmunity.They found that adding salt to the diet of mice induced the production of Th17 cells and that mice genetically engineered to develop a form of MS had more severe disease than mice fed a normal mouse diet.Hafler says the findings now need to be studied in people. He has already gotten permission to test the effects of lowering the salt intake in the diets of individuals with multiple sclerosis to see if their symptoms improve.It likely be years before this link is confirmed, but Hafler says for patients already at risk of autoimmune disease, reducing dietary salt may be a good idea.""If I had MS, I would think very much about not eating processed foods and really cutting down my salt intake,"" he said.

Her neuro-oncologist, Dr. Jeremy Rudnick, told People magazine that treatment options are limited for the disease. According to Fox Chase Cancer Center, the condition -- which is also called neoplastic meningitis -- occurs when cancer cells get into the membranes around the brain and spinal cord (called the meninges). It is quite rare, occurring in only about 5 percent of people with cancer. ""This is a really complicated condition,"" Rudnick explained to People. ""The spinal fluid is a collection of fluid that's being circulated [through the brain] kind of like a sink. The fluid itself is growing cancer cells so they are multiplying in there. Those cells start to coat the brain."" Fox Chase Cancer Center explains why it's so hard to treat the disease: It is difficult to treat because chemotherapy drugs injected intravenously (into a vein) often do not reach high enough concentrations in the meninges to be effective. As a result, chemotherapy for neoplastic meningitis is often given intrathecally, injected into the fluid-filled space between the meninges.According to a 2009 article in the journal Cancer, there are no set guidelines for treating the condition. Another article, published in 2004 in the Annals of Oncology, says that the condition is usually diagnosed through brain imaging, such as MRI. Symptoms of the condition may include headaches, seizures, vomiting, weakness in the legs, bladder or bowel dysfunction, hearing loss and numbness in the face, according to the Medical College of Wisconsin.

A baby born with the AIDS virus appears to have been cured, scientists announced Sunday, March 3, 2013, describing the case of a child from Mississippi who's now 2ￂﾽ and has been off medication for about a year with no signs of infection. ""I just felt like this baby was at higher-than-normal risk, and deserved our best shot,"" said Gay. (AP Photo/ University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jay Ferchaud)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce5351f000050002167d6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Emily Le Coz and Julie SteenhuysenJACKSON, Mississippi/CHICAGO, Illinois (Reuters) - The doctor who cured an HIV infected baby for the first time is happier talking to children than to adults and is finding all the attention since the news came out a little overwhelming.Dr. Hannah Gay and colleagues Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga of the University of Massachusetts and Dr. Deborah Persaud of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore reported on the child's case at a medical meeting in Atlanta on Sunday.""The breakthrough has been exciting and I'm very hopeful that that's going to lead to future research that will give us some answers,"" said Gay, a Mississippi pediatrician and soft-spoken mother of four adult children.But the attention is difficult for a woman ""much more comfortable talking to children than adults,"" said her husband, Paul Gay. ""She didn't anticipate this kind of explosion of attention.""Dr. Gay, a 59-year-old native of Jackson, Mississippi, likes to spend time designing needle points, singing in her church choir and reading theology or medical literature when she's not working 12-hour days treating patients, in a state with the nation's highest poverty rate.""She is the most unlikely person in the world to be getting this kind of international attention, really,"" said Jay Richardson, her former pastor at the Highland Colony Baptist Church. ""You don't ever hear her talking about herself or trying to promote herself in any way. She's a quiet, humble person. Extremely intelligent. Very committed to her faith. Very involved in her church. Very committed to teaching children the bible.""Except for six years working in Ethiopia as a missionary, Dr. Gay has spent the bulk of her academic and professional career at the University of Mississippi, where she received her undergraduate and medical degrees and met her husband of 37 years. She has worked the better part of her career at the university's medical center serving the state's youngest victims of HIV.During that time, Dr. Gay has published several articles about ways to keep mothers from passing HIV infection to their babies and participated in the federally sponsored Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group, which studied the use of the aggressive treatment of children who are at high risk of infection.Her daughter Ruth Gay Thomas says as an AIDS specialist her mother has had to fight the battles of her patients, overcoming access to healthcare and the stigma that comes along with being infected with HIV in the United States.""She practices compassion and huge, unimaginable amounts of patience with her patients and their families,"" Thomas said. ""She really has to embody a whole lot more than just the smart doctor that knows the right medications to give.""To treat her own rheumatoid arthritis, Dr. Gay takes medicine that affects her immune system. ""She has that in common with her patients, but it's been a problem because with her compromised immune system, she can't have as much of a hands-on touching of her patients that was always so satisfying for her,"" her husband said.When a rural hospital in Mississippi delivered a premature baby girl in July 2010 from a mother who had just tested positive for HIV during labor, it was only natural that they would turn to Dr. Gay. The child's mother had not received any prenatal care, nor had she gotten any treatment for her HIV infection, putting the baby at high risk of becoming infected.Dr. Gay chose to start the baby on the full treatment regimen of three potent drugs when she was just 30 hours old, even before the child's infection was confirmed.It was a bold move. Most babies exposed to HIV in the womb or during labor would have been given a six-week course of one or two drugs intended to reduce the risk of acquiring infection until tests could confirm she was infected.""The doctor made a judgment call that the risks for this baby were so high that they were going to assume the baby was infected,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a part of the National Institutes of Health or NIH.Some critics have questioned Dr. Gay's decision, which may have exposed the child to the risk of toxic medications without confirmation of her infection.""This was a gutsy call that turned out to be correct,"" said Fauci, adding that if it had turned out that the baby was not infected, they could have withdrawn the drugs. ""They made the right guess.""Dr. Gay continued to treat the child until January 2012, when she was 18 months old and her mother stopped bringing the child in for appointments. Gay's team tracked her down in the fall of 2012, but the mother had not given her child any HIV medication since January.Before restarting treatment, Gay did several tests, fully expecting that the virus had come roaring back. But none of the tests detected the virus. That's when she brought in colleagues Luzuriaga of the University of Massachusetts and Persaud of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who did a series of ultrasensitive tests. They were only able to find trace amounts of genetic material from the virus, but nothing capable of rekindling the infection.The child, now 30 months old, remains off medication and continues to fare well. ""We can't find any virus to treat at this point,"" Dr. Gay said.She said it is not clear what the child's story will mean in the wider scheme of HIV research, but she hopes it may lead to a cure for other babies infected at birth.""I guess the message that I want to get across to the public very strongly is, we don't know yet if we can create the same outcome in other babies."" she said. ""It's far too early to draw too many conclusions. There's not a cure in sight this week.""Dr. Gay said she is glad that this is happening in Mississippi and hopes it boosts the state's reputation.""But it's a whole lot bigger than this one child, the University Medical Center or the state,"" she said. ""It may take a long time, but I hope it will point us in the right direction to come up with a cure we can consistently apply to other babies worldwide.""Colleagues at the medical center are planning a celebration for Dr. Gay to ""let her know how proud we are,"" said Amy Smith, a nurse practitioner who works with the doctor. ""She's the type that wouldn't want a big fuss made about her, but we're going to do it anyway.""(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen and Emily Le Coz; Editing by Jilian Mincer and Claudia Parsons)"
4,DIVORCE,Severing Ties With the Ex: A Lunch Conversation,"Christine Gallagher, Contributor
Author and therapist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/severing-ties-with-the-ex_us_5b9cdba8e4b03a1dcc82798a,"While it may have been okay in the past for an ex to drop by and play with his kid every evening, a new partner may want some privacy. It can be a tricky balancing act.",2013-03-05,Radiant young woman texting while lying on a bed against white background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdba83c0000320009ed60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was having lunch with a group of women recently and the conversation turned (surprise!) to relationships. Carole told us she had just finalized her fairly amiable divorce. Her problem was that her ex still called her almost every day and kept her up to date on everything going on in both his life and the lives of his extended family members. Carole wanted much less contact with him but felt conflicted. They had so much shared history -- like old friends. But, she said, it kept her in an uncomfortable intimacy with him. There had been a minor earthquake early one morning. The phone by Carole's bed immediately rang. It was her ex checking that she was okay. ""What if I'd had someone there?"" she asked. It never even crossed his mind that he might be intruding.Carole's dilemma sparked a lengthy conversation about whether and when it's a good idea to sever ties with the ex or modify the relationship to some degree. The issue comes up sooner or later for most divorced people, particularly if there are children involved, or if a new partner enters the scene. While it may have been okay in the past for an ex to drop by and play with his kid every evening, a new partner may want some privacy. It can be a tricky balancing act.Pat then shared with us her concern about the divorced man she's dating. Jeff's been apart for five years from an ex who loathes and detests him and is very vocal about it. One day Pat and Jeff were sitting in his car eating ice cream when the ex called on the car phone. The ex was furious about some unpaid child-related bill she felt Jeff should pay immediately. Jeff asked to discuss it later since Pat was in the car. The ex became even more incensed. ""I don't care who's in the car, we need to talk about this now!"" she yelled. The problem here was twofold for Pat. Not only did the ex feel she had to be heard and that Pat was irrelevant, but Jeff let her continue with her rant. Pat is now questioning her relationship with a man who she feels is still not emotionally divorced from his wife. ""It was scary to see how easily she pushed his buttons,"" she said. ""I've never seen him that angry before.""Jenny, another woman at the table, then described the big shift in the divorced family dynamic which occurred this last Christmas. Jenny is now living with a man and this was to be their first Christmas together. However it's also the first Christmas where her ex-husband was not invited to come on Christmas morning to open gifts with his and Jenny's children. Even when they were separated, he was included for the children's sake. Jenny felt it was too awkward this first Christmas with her new partner and suggested her children open gifts at her house, then go to their father's house to open gifts a second time. The surprise came when the kids returned and said they had invited their father over later for Christmas dinner. Jenny asked her new man how he felt about it. He hesitated, laughed and then generously said it was okay if it would make the kids happy. So in the end a compromise was made which took into account everyone's feelings, though Jenny said she felt awkward at the meal and was glad when it was all over.It was a long lunch. We went on to talk about the colleague who is still having ""no-ties"" sex with his ex, the neighbor who's dating a man who still shares the house he owns with his ex because neither one will give it up, and my hair cutter Viv who hates it when her live-in boyfriend has his monthly dinner with his ex-wife and their 12-year-old daughter. Viv understands it's probably good for the child to see her parents together, but she feels left out, like he's living in the past. By the time we got to coffee and dessert, we all agreed that severing ties with the ex is a complex issue and there are no simple answers. Afterwards I jotted down a few general guidelines that might be of help:1. If you have to have a conversation with the ex and it veers into old familiar angry territory, end the chat fast. Let the ex know you won't venture back into this swampy area.2. Keep communication down the to the minimum; use texts and emails to make arrangements about children's activities etc.3. Don't be too familiar with the ex. Always call before showing up. Treat his or her home like you would anyone you are not related to. Don't dive into the refrigerator and help yourself to leftovers.4. You're not your ex's husband or wife anymore. So if old patterns come up, like he calls and wants you to come and help him with graphics for his new website, politely suggest he find a professional to help him out. Those days are over.5. Even if you and your ex have arrived at a working situation, be flexible when a new partner enters the picture who may not be comfortable with the relationship dynamic.None of this is written in stone, of course. There are ex-husbands and ex-wives who socialize and even work together with no problems. But in most cases, the more emotional distance the better.Please comment below on any of the situations discussed at our lunch. What would you do?"

Yahoo announced Monday, July 16, 2012, that it is hiring longtime Google executive Marissa Mayer to be its next CEO, the fifth in five years as the company struggles to rebound from years of financial malaise and internal turmoil. Mayer, who starts at Yahoo Inc. on Tuesday, was one of Googleￂﾒs earliest employees and was most recently responsible for its mapping, local and location services.

The Yahoo! CEO notoriously took a two-week maternity leave, calling into question her commitment or even her desire for a work-life balance. Many women who looked at the pregnant CEO of the Internet powerhouse were left wondering why someone who had the potential to be an amazing advocate or example to working women, instead ostensibly said ""children shouldn't impact time spent at work any more than a bad case of the flu.""As a woman I understand that my role as a parent shouldn't factor into the way I'm viewed professionally. But also, as a women, I think it is imperative that our commitments to our family be respected and demanded.Last week, Mayer called to an end the ability for employees to telecommute.Said Mayer: ""To become the absolute best place to work, communication and collaboration will be important, so we need to be working side-by-side. That is why it is critical that we are all present in our offices. Some of the best decisions and insights come from hallway and cafeteria discussions, meeting new people, and impromptu team meetings. Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home.""Related: Federal Court: Employers Must Try to Accommodate Child Care Needs of StaffAccording to Mayer, speed and quality of work are sacrificed by accommodating schedules. According to a wack of studies listed conveniently on Mommyish.com, the reality is something quite different. In fact, flex schedules and telecommuting have been a great step forward in the work force, recognizing the various needs of people's lives outside the office.Mayer's recent policy change is reflective of a corporate culture that espouses that your first and only commitment should be to your job. Thing is, no one exists in a vacuum and being chained to a desk will negatively affect morale and thus drive and productivity. That's not my opinion. That's fact.The latest news out of Yahoo! is that Mayer is setting up a nursery in her office so that she can be close to her child. This would call into question the notion that she doesn't think work-life balance is important, but for the fact she isn't offering this as an option to any other employees. What she is doing, instead, is accommodating her own life while taking away the one accommodation her employees have to make their own personal situations easier.Anyone who has read anything about Marissa Mayer has been left with the impression that she's a cold fish who is a calculating, heartless, career-bent CEO. But, in fairness, how much does the public know, ask or care about male CEOs and their work-life balance? What Mayer is doing, though maybe too well, is separating the voyeuristic interest in her private life by making little mention of it. The sad but all too true reality is that for women to be taken seriously in business they can't talk about their families. They need to be seen as focused on their job and only their job. Men don't have those same challenges. Not talking about their children doesn't make them cold. It makes them business minded. No questions asked. No judgement. Marissa Mayer has been quoted as saying her priorities are ""God, family and Yahoo! -- in that order."" How her personal life philosophy falls into what can only be described as a major step backwards in the workplace is beyond me. It's either a classic case of 'do as I say but not as I do' or she's selling a life philosophy but living another.Anyway you slice it, Mayer is adding to the feeding frenzy of interest into intricacies of her private life by making it less possible for her thousands of employees to live theirs the same way before she took the helm.More on BabyPost What Not to Say to Your Child-free Friends Walt Disney World on a Budget Rebecca Eckler: Why I Care What My Son Wears"

I felt the same thing. I wanted to understand why I felt this to be true and why it made me sad.""My child will miss out."" Is that true? It's true that my child will not experience things that other kids do. He already has. His peers went to daycare, pre-K and elementary school. They've had kindergarten graduation, grandparents' day and moms visiting the class to read books. They've had good teachers and bad teachers. They've been on field trips. They play sports on a team. They've gone over to friends' houses for playdates and sleepovers. They ride bikes and scooters. They've seen Star Wars. My child has not experienced those things.He will not experience the things I did growing up, either. No memories of a first-grade teacher like mine who wanted to be an astronaut, even though she walked with a cane. No friends he can look at and say ""Dear Lord, we've been friends since elementary school."" No chasing after an ice cream truck or playing kickball in the yard. No tree-climbing or bike races.So it is true that he won't experience the same things. Why does that make me feel sad? It's because my entire frame of reference is wrong. Consider it this way: I grew up in Florida. I remember areas outside the city that were rolling hills of orange groves. Orange tree after orange tree. Dark green leaves, bright orange dots, the fragrance of orange blossoms. I loved that smell. Now, when I drive back to visit I say, ""See those hills where all those houses are? There used to be orange trees there."" It's sad, poignant -- for me. But someone growing up there now never knew the orange groves. They grow up in those rolling hills of houses and say, ""See, that house there? My grandmother lives there. I used to rollerblade down that hill. It's awesome.""When I try to imagine how my child feels about life, I take my childhood and try to imagine my life minus those experiences. But that's a fallacy. Anytime I try to subtract my experiences, I will feel a sense of loss. That same sadness happens when I imagine what I think is a ""normal"" childhood, an ideal childhood, that comes with a list of all the experiences a child needs for a great childhood. Karate, Valentines, music lessons, ballet, team sports, schoolmates, formal dances, first car, spring break, college visits. Any missed experience means that I have to cross that item off his list. A missed experience means a less-than-ideal childhood. Always. It's a flawed paradigm for any child.Children with a disability do not have a life ""minus."" They have a life, period. It's their life. It's not some other child's life, their parent's life or their peers' life. It's their life.A complete childhood has nothing to do with specific experiences. A complete childhood does have certain qualities: connectedness, optimism, playfulness, a passion for things that interest them, a feeling of proficiency at things they want to do and a feeling of being loved wholeheartedly for who they are right now. That's the list that matters."

The new HPI shows that prices still haven't recovered to where they were hovering before the financial collapse in 2008 and that excellent deals are still available, predominantly in Europe.Over the course of the last year, the price of European hotel rooms has increased by only 1 percent -- a fairly stunning number given that the London Olympics attracted enormous crowds who paid enormous sums of money. On the other end of the spectrum, prices continued to rise more rapidly in the Pacific region, which has seen rates rocket up 21 percent in the last three years largely thanks to the reliability of business travel.These numbers don't necessarily mean that travel to Europe has become incredibly cheap -- food and transportation continue to be expensive -- but they do mean that high-end luxury is available to anyone savvy enough to find a deal. Of the 10 cities with the lowest five-star room rates, seven are in Europe. And these are desirable destinations: Berlin, Lisbon and Pisa made the list.As Europe's economic crisis churns forward, the trends of 2012 are likely to become the trends of 2013, meaning that now might be the time to visit the continent. That said, there is an argument to be made that it is really the time to visit Asia and the Pacific in an attempt to get there before it get too expensive."
