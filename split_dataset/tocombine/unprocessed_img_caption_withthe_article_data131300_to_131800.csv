In this edition, we bring you rumors about Apple's move into the medical sensor field, the ""iPhone 6,"" and more.iMedicineLast week, Google unveiled its plans for a contact lens that would monitor the blood glucose level of the wearer, a development that would make the lives of diabetics significantly easier. Not to be outdone by the fellow tech giant, 9to5 Mac reports that Apple has been on a hiring spree for engineers and developers to work on products with medical sensors. Apple hired Nancy Dougherty from startup Sano Intelligence, a company with developments that include a small, painless, needle-less patch that can analyze a person's blood. 9to5 Mac notes that it seems plausible that Apple could work to integrate this technology into its so-called “iWatch.” Recent rumors have some estimating that 2014 could be the year we finally see Apple's long-speculated smart watch. Eye Spy9to5 Mac is also reporting that Apple is actively researching iris-scanning technology, ""according to sources."" Earlier this month in an interview with Bloomgberg News, Lee Young Hee, executive vice president of Samsung's mobile business, confirmed that the company is experimenting with iris-scanning technologies to unlock phones for potential implementation in the Galaxy S5 this year. In addition, 9to5 Mac writes that Apple is in the process of studying new ways to apply sensors to improve facial recognition, and enhance security, photography and other parts of Apple's mobile devices.""iPhone 6"" x 2According to research firm Display Search, Apple's next iPhone will give consumers the option to choose between two sizes. One would be the typical iPhone display (4.7 inches), while the other would be a larger, 5.5-inch screen that resembles the bigger displays featured on Samsung's Galaxy phones. Further speculation from MacRumors indicates that based on Apple's use of new alloys from LiquidMetal Technologies, the new iPhone will be thinner and lighter thanks to these new materials.In July, a 9to5 Mac report said that in the coming years, Apple may work to integrate Touch ID fingerprint technology into the screen of the iPhone and iPad, not just into the home button."

That if you write the next great mobile app there is nothing that can stop it from fulfilling its destiny. That if you create a mobile content app that blows away Netflix there is nothing that can stop it.Wrong.There are basically two doors that control the availability of apps to the vast majority of smartphones in this country. They are owned and controlled by two of the largest tech companies in the world, Apple and Google.If you want your app to reach any type of audience (yes there are other app platforms supporting phones on the margin, but they are tiny by comparison), you have to make Google and Apple happy.You have to make them happy by the type, quality, subject matter and more of your app. You have to make them happy with your revenue model. You have to make them happy in more ways than most app developers can count. And in reality,the good news is, they both are playing nice these days.But, and its just a hypothetical, what if they stopped playing nice ? What if, in order to drive up their stock prices they created their own version of a Fast Lane/Priority App Positioning for which they charged? What if Google decided to sell by bid, positions in their store like they do ads? What if Apple charged revenue minimums for them to distribute an app to their user base? I'm not saying these or any other changes are coming but if I were a betting person I would handicap the odds that at some point in the next two years both companies will look towards their app stores for new sources of revenue. What happens then?The mobile app economy is far from open. It's dominated by two companies. It is in the best interest of the entire mobile eco-system to address this duopoly while we are re-examining net neutrality. We should seriously consider requiring Apple to allow and support 3rd party app stores and to require that Google continues to support and enable 3rd party stores and more importantly to integrate them into the Play Store, much as Amazon does with Marketplace integration.Lets open up the mobile app ecosystem and make sure it stays open.What do you think?Cross-posted from BlogMaverick.com."
2,TRAVEL,Please Don't Call Them Airlines -- They're Loyalty Companies,"Christopher Elliott, Contributor
Author, How to Be the World's Smartest Traveler (and Save Time...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/please-dont-call-them-air_us_5b9dcc9fe4b03a1dcc8d06f8,"So why aren't any other watchdogs speaking out about this twisted business model, which relies on us paying for an unregulated currency in order to get the benefits all travelers probably deserve?",2014-01-19,"United Continental Holdings Inc. airplanes line up alongside a Delta Air Lines Inc. airplane on the tarmac at San Diego International Airport in San Diego, California, U.S. on Thursday, Sept. 19, 2013. Airlines must reconsider buying new or used aircraft as rising interest rates increase ownership costs, which could outweigh fuel savings at lower prices. Photographer: Sam Hodgson/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dcc9f240000510095375f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Airlines don't exist.I came to that somewhat Magrittesque conclusion after hearing from Julie Eisenberg, a loyal United Airlines customer who last year spent $1,700 per ticket to fly her partner and herself from Washington to Sydney.For just $600 more, plus 30,000 miles, United promised her a chance to upgrade into a slightly roomier seat. But the ticket agent she spoke with failed to mention that there were no guarantees and that the money and miles would be deducted from her account then and there, many months before her flight.""The only way I can get the miles and money back is to cancel my upgrade request,"" she says. ""They will have possession of the money and the miles from the date I booked, on May 10, 2013.""Veteran frequent fliers know this is how it's done at United, of course, but it didn't sit well with Eisenberg.""I'm really shocked that it's OK for them to hold this amount of money and return it after almost a year, paying no interest on it,"" she says. ""Yet they continue to insist that they can't confirm our upgrade.""Why, she wonders, can United get away with that?Well, there's a simple answer -- and a complicated one.The simple one: because they can.An airline is free to set its own rules and policies without government interference. It's been that way since the industry was deregulated 36 years ago.The complex -- and somewhat controversial -- answer: Maybe United is no longer an airline. Maybe it's a loyalty company that happens to be running an airline.You see, charging a customer months before a flight for a promise to consider an upgrade into a seat that should be standard on a marathon transpacific flight doesn't make any sense if you're an airline that cares about its customers. A compassionate airline gives all of its passengers a reasonably comfortable seat, no questions asked.But it makes perfect sense if you're looking at this from the perspective of a loyalty company trying to prod customers into buying more.A look at United Airline's latest annual report shows why it's no longer entirely accurate to call it an airline. In 2012, it sold $5.1 billion worth of frequent flier miles to credit cards and other third parties. It expects about a quarter of those miles to expire or go unredeemed.By comparison, United earned $25.8 billion in revenue from its mainline passenger operations for the year. In other words, 1 out of every 5 dollars earned was because of MileagePlus, and worse, it doesn't always have to give customers something for their purchase. United will only have to honor 4 out of every 5 points earned through one of its partners. (If that number gets too high, no problem! Just devalue the miles, as it did for 2014.)Ka-ching!In 2013, airlines raked in a total of $18.9 billion from the sale of frequent flier miles to program partners, according to an estimate by IdeaWorks. That figure also includes some commissions from the sale of services to travelers. Hotels are less forthcoming, but in a recent conversation with a high-level executive for a major hotel chain, I was told that roughly half of every booking had a loyalty program component and that the programs were a ""significant"" source of revenue.Do you really need me to tell you we're going down the wrong road here?When travelers clamor for gimmicks in order to be treated just a little more humanely, when the sale of these elusive ""rewards"" are what makes a company profitable, what has this world come to?Forgive me for being an idealist, but shouldn't an airline make money by transporting passengers? Shouldn't a hotel earn an honest living by selling accommodations?The tail is wagging the dog, my friends.So why aren't any other watchdogs speaking out about this twisted business model, which relies on us paying for an unregulated currency in order to get the benefits all travelers probably deserve?Perhaps the airlines and credit card companies have built a small army of propagandists masquerading as bloggers and consumer advocates, who obediently endorse the loyalty lifestyle in exchange for six-figure referral fees. Then again, maybe they're betting customers won't question the economics behind the offers -- that they'll actually believe the flights and rooms are ""free.""Are we that naive?I think we'll find out soon enough. If more consumers blindly sign up and participate in these programs, lining the pockets of airline and hotel company shareholders, then at some point, we won't have a travel business anymore.It will be a loyalty industry.After you've left a comment here, let's continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google. I also have a free newsletter and you'll definitely want to pre-order my new, amazingly helpful and subversive book called How to Be the World's Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle).

One of those shared goals is the preservation of their respective dance forms by allowing it to evolve for a new generation with the help of the Internet. ""For some reason people think tap is just what they see in vaudeville and minstrel shows. A lot of those ideas of what people think tap is or was can hold some back from using their imagination of how to use tap and incorporate it in society today.

The documentary of this tour runs like an extra long episode of The Daily Show -- but in a good way. Plenty of montages of Fox featured crazies saying outrageous things coupled with both thoughtful and angry takes on this issue from the likes of Jon Stewart, Rachel Maddow, Aasif Mandvi, Ali Velshi and Soledad O'Brien. But the heart of the film, and there is lot of heart here, is watching this band of edgy, self-aware, second-generation NY wiseass Muslim comics extend themselves to people in small town America who sometimes have no idea what to do with them. With sidewalk gimmicks like ""Ask a Muslim a Question,"" ""Bowl with a Muslim,"" ""Hug a Muslim"" as well as comedy shows in community centers large and small, featured players and filmmakers Dean Obeidallah and Negin Farsad, along with Aron Kader, Preacher Moss, Kareem Omary Maysoon Zayid and Oma Elba literally extend a hand and try for a dialogue, for understanding, for common ground. The lack of irony and guilelessness of the project underscores the simplicity of what is clearly a mission of tolerance. The standup comedy is pretty great in and of itself -- besides a definitely light-handed approach towards hate there is plenty of standard comic themes that resonate across all cultures -- mostly making fun of your parents and your own awkward loserdom. But that's where this film gets truly interesting -- in The Muslims Are Coming! we learn as much about what drives comedians as what drives these Muslim activists -- a yearning to be seen, heard, respected and perhaps even loved. Sometimes they connect, sometimes they falter -- feminist and potty-mouthed Negin Farsad watches as hajib-wearing women walk out during her routine and she talks about it later with a vulnerability that steals the show. There's plenty of straight political activism -- this band of comic Muslim brothers and sisters go to a gun range, a Southern bible belt Islamic Center and the Tupelo Mississippi-based American Family Association. They are always friendly and gracious and these efforts become both infectious and endearing and ultimately win the day.I recently interviewed Farsad and Obeidallah about their film: Nancy Doyle Palmer: Any updates on reaction to the film at screenings at colleges and other venues ?Negin Farsad: We opened theatrically in eight cities. By and large the reaction during those runs was GREAT. People came out in droves, they said lovely things, tweeted, someone even gave me free chocolate! It really doesn't get any better than that! But we also managed to get ourselves in right wing attack articles in Breitbart.com and Front Page. My favorite was a Washington Times article that attacked the movie while referring to me as Mr. Farsad throughout the entire piece. Now, getting attacked for making a movie about social justice is annoying enough but assuming that the director is a man -- that a woman wouldn't have the wherewithal to a make a movie worth attacking! -- that's like an Islamophobia-misogyny sandwich that makes me nuts. NDP: Were there any other reactions from people on the street or in audiences that you weren't able to include in the film that you can share now that add to the goals of this project? Or the horror?Dean Obeidallah: No horror! The reactions on the street in the film are a good sample of what we encountered from people wanting to engage and have substantive conversations to people asking challenging questions to many people not being interested at all in speaking with us. We are actually happy that so many took the time to chat and ask questions because we believe that the questions we featured in the film represent the common questions many have about Muslims.NDP: One thing that struck me about your film is that we learn as much about the vulnerability and soul of stand-up comics as we do about Muslim activists trying to change the world. There is a bravery in putting yourself out there in a way that's both challenging your audience and asking them to care about you... isn't that sometimes just hard to do? NF: I think you hit the nail on the head. All comedians are asking people to love them. It's a weird, sick, narcissistic, needy profession. But with political comics or with a social justice comic like myself (I'm pretending ""social justice comic"" is a thing!) -- with us we're also telling them to change their frame of thought. We're asking them to dash stereotypes, or be involved in the electoral process, or recycle, or... ugh, we're just constantly asking them for shit! So yeah, I think it is challenging to walk that line but I'm not sure what the alternative is.DO: Since all the comedians featured in the film have performed stand up for many years, we really don't think about the idea that you are putting yourself out there. It is something we just do. Also personally I don't subscribe to the view that it takes bravery to do stand up. It likely takes a personality disorder. And to be honest I view police officers, firemen, people in the military, etc. as being brave. Telling jokes to other Americans doesn't rise to the level of bravery in my mind.NDP: Negin -- you speak eloquently in the film about the extra burden of dealing with dated attitudes towards women within Islam as well as some of the more conservative audience members on the tour. Yet you also seemed to base a lot of your routines on sexual issues and language -- is this just because of your comic identity or is there a sort of deliberate challenge here? NF: Like most comedians, I started out talking about my life -- dating, family, friends -- and it never occurred to me to censor myself. There were no other Iranian-American comic elders to use as a frame of reference -- I looked up to icons of American comedy and none of them were ever demonized for talking about sex or dating. I never considered my material racy until I performed for my first mostly Iranian audience. They were traumatized by my honesty. I guess I could have been jolted by that experience and tailor my material to them. But as immigrants' kid I didn't think that lying about my experiences was going to help anything. It felt odd that we were all pretending not to date or have any kind of sexual identity. Don't get me wrong; when a show asks for a ""clean"" set, I can do that. But I don't think we should fundamentally deny our real identities. Because here's the thing, we are from the mother country but we're also American. We have to forge a new identity in the American context and hopefully people will come along.   NDP: One of the most moving segments in the film for me is the ""Hug A Muslim"" segment in Salt Lake City. You all were always so open and friendly to people you met and so often received that in kind... can you speak to that discovery that so many people are, indeed, willing to embrace your message?DO: I can't tell you how many actually embraced our message but many did embrace us! But obviously on some level if people are hugging you, it is a sign that they are open and tolerant to what we were talking about. The hope with the film is that it chips away at misconceptions and contributes to a better understanding of Muslims. But it will take more than one comedy documentary to change the world -- it is a start though!NF. I think it's about the approach. If we wanted to go out there and provoke people we could have made a movie about the jerks of America. But what we really wanted to do was meet people and talk to them -- it's so simple and yet it happens so rarely. And we found that if you approach people with love, you'll get love in return. As cheesy and ridiculous as that sounds, I've found that most of the time, that's true. It makes me feel so much better about humanity"

And I that's something Lynn Shelton and I really wanted to be on the same,2014-01-19,"Cast members Keira Knightley, left, and Sam Rockwell, pose together at the premiere of the film ""Laggies"" during the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, on Friday, Jan. 17, 2014, in Park City, Utah. (Photo by Danny Moloshok/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4495c2400003200560966.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sam Rockwell is sitting at a bar in Sundance drinking seltzer water. Joking about bloody noses and how, because of it, Park City, Utah isn't the ideal climate for doing 8-balls, Rockwell spoke with The Huffington Post about his latest role as a single dad raising a teenage daughter, played by the magnetic Chloë Grace Moretz, in the Sundance film “Laggies.” Shot in Seattle, where director Lynn Shelton (“Humpday,” “Your Sister’s Sister”) does all of her films, “Laggies” turns the lens on Megan (Keira Knightley), a woman in her late 20s who just cannot find a way to have her life make sense. After befriending a teenager (Moretz) in a parking lot, Megan is brought into the youngster's home and life quite unexpectedly. Highlights from our conversation below.“Laggies” is my favorite movie this year at Sundance. Really! That’s awesome. It's a rom-com with some layers, right? It's deep and it's also commercial. It's really your favorite film?I have one movie left to see before I go, so that has a chance of dethroning you. It's Zach Braff’s new film, “Wish I Was Here.” Oh, there you go. He directed it. He's a good filmmaker. Is this his second movie? He really took his time. In the film, Keira Knightley's character attends her 10-year high school reunion and is going through what we might call a quarter-life crisis. Did you identify with that aspect of the movie at all?  I did my 10-year reunion a while ago now. So I think I'm more in the mid-life crisis zone now [laughs].Are you exhibiting any symptoms? I haven't bought a Porsche or anything, but I have a big flat-screen TV and I'm looking to get a bigger one.And you have a beard. Yes, I have a beard, but that's for something I'm shooting. But yes, I totally relate with all of that stuff -- getting older and not wanting to grow up. But I had a lot in common with the character I played, Craig. I had sort of already been through the stuff Keira’s character goes through. It’s the male equivalent of “High Fidelity” or “The Graduate” or even “The Hangover.” But this was really the first middle-aged part I've played [laughs]. And it's weird. I've played dads before. But in movies that nobody saw. But those characters were still kids; I was really playing a big kid.Your character in “Laggies” is an adult. He's an adult. It was fun to do that. Without [screenwriter] Andrea Seigel’s writing, I couldn't have. It's like when I did “Frost/Nixon.” I'm not that smart in real life. I'm a different kind of smart. My intelligence probably goes more through my sense of humor or acting. When you're playing somebody who is well educated, you need that text, that script. And then it's your job to make it real and personal.What was most compelling about this character for you? I loved his melancholy. In the same way that Rick in ""Casablanca"" has a kind of melancholy, there's a similar emotional through-line with this character. The obvious sort of Tom Hanks or Paul Rudd aspect of this character, but mixed in with a little William Hurt and Jack Nicholson. He’s got a lot going on. He’s not what he seems to be in the beginning. And I that's something Lynn Shelton and I really wanted to be on the same page about. In a way, we were trying to trick the audience because Mark Webber's character is the youthful one. When you think of youth, you think of spontaneity. And you think of adults as being more cautious. I probably seem more cautious in the beginning and less spontaneous, but what you find out is that I actually have a lot of spontaneity -- it’s just been buried. So it's kind of a switcheroo. We had to camouflage my youthfulness. It's kind of like gift-wrapping a bomb in pink paper.Did you audition for the role? No. Lynn just called me. Paul Rudd was actually supposed to do it. And Anne Hathaway was playing the female role. Chloe was in before I was. And then I came on, and we lost Anne. She dropped out, regretfully. I know she wanted to do it. But she had another commitment; I think it was with director Christopher Nolan. And then we were scrambling. Went out to a few people. Thank god we got Keira.I thought her American accent was good. I know people can be harsh about that. Listen, she did great. And she had so little time to prepare. She was getting married. She was prepping with a dialect coach after her honeymoon. I haven’t loved her in a film like this since “Bend It Like Beckham.” That’s exactly what Lynn Shelton said. Even the drunk scene in ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" with Johnny Depp where they're drinking rum on the beach, you can tell she's got a little punk rock in her. And it's the kind of thing that Melanie Griffith did in ""Something Wild."" That’s one of the greatest movies ever made. Ray Liotta. It's how he got “Goodfellas."" But Melanie has that same thing that Keira has in ""Bend It Like Beckham."" You can’t really describe it. You know, it's just somebody you want to go to a rock concert with.""Laggies"" was picked up by A24 after its Sundance Film Festival premiere. Expect to see it in theaters this summer."

This sickening sight fraught with unimaginable pain must come to an end -- Amnesty for all dolphins and whales now! Photo courtesy of OccupyForAnimals.comHow long do the other 'civilized' nations intend to sit on the sidelines and allow Japan to kill and poach sentient bottlenose dolphins, other small-toothed whales and magnificent endangered baleen or filter-feeding whales?This much we do know with certainty: The oceans are ailing, terribly. And as Captain Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society continues to remind us, ""If the oceans die, we die!"" It's time for this senseless bloodlust against the dolphins and whales to end, now. Photo courtesy of Moral Low GroundOn Friday January 17, 2014 Sea Shepherd once again sounded the emergency alarm as five pods of Bottlenose dolphins or about 250 creatures were penned up off the coast of the infamous and ignoble town of Taiji, Japan.Twenty-five dolphins have been mercilessly separated from their families and captured for the live-trade and burgeoning dolphinariums of SE Asia and the affluent oil-rich Middle-Eastern countries. An extraordinary and rare example of an albino Bottlenose Dolphin. It will be separated from its mother and sold like a mundane slab of beef. How absolutely shocking and unconscionable. Photo courtesy of Sea Shepherd Conservation SocietyOne of the juveniles is a rare albino or all white Bottlenose. Indigenous Peoples around the globe consider these 'spirit' animals as sacred. This beauty of a beast will be separated from its mother and either sold into enslavement as a live performing animal or slaughtered and feasted upon by unconscious nouvelle riche gluttons.The remaining 225 Bottlenose or so will be slaughtered slowly with spears for a multi-million dollar heartless, bloodthirsty industry.It is prudent for all humans to consider what the Cree Nation has written about The War Against Nature:Only after the last tree has been cut down, Only after the last river has been poisoned, Only after the last fish has been caught. Only then we will find that money cannot be eaten! Bottlenose Dolphins and humans share many similarities including disciplining our young and solving problems. Photo courtesy of theTaijiList.blogspot.comDid you know that humans and Bottlenose Dolphins appear to be the only known animals to spontaneously interpret images on a screen without prior teaching? Dolphins are capable of highly flexible behavior, and therefore are considered intelligent. Moreover, Bottlenose dolphins remember the signature whistle of each individual pod member even when separated for more than two decades, making them champions for the longest memory among non-human species according to scientists at the University of Chicago. Interestingly, just like human teenagers experiment with hallucinogenic drugs so, too, do juvenile Bottlenose. They carefully manipulate Pufferfish (rather aptly-named) to release its toxins, pass it amongst one another like a joint of marijuana and then drop into a trance. This deliberate behavior appears to carry some of the hallmarks of human drug use. Clearly, human and Bottlenose are very similar creatures. Bottlenose juveniles like to experience the high from Pufferfish poison not dissimilarly to juvenile Earthlings as they, too, experiment with mind altering plant drugs. Photo credit BBC John Downer ProductionsBottlenose dolphins are of paramount importance for ecosystem health as they cull weak, unfit, old or sick prey thus preventing diseases from becoming epidemics throughout our oceans.Let me remind you that the prolonged global looting spree on other crucial predators like sharks of at least 73 million slaughtered each year are also impoverishing our oceans. This is ecocide and crimes against humanity. What we are doing to all life in the oceans, we are doing to ourselves -- obviously it is time to stop massacring all wildlife.

Clearly, this intersection of art and commerce is where the action is: I arrived at the convention center for the LA Art Show the day before the exclusive opening night premiere party to check things out and get an early start on investigating acres of temporary urban art jungle, featuring thirty percent more galleries than last year's fair and including almost fifty international galleries from around the globe. Looking down from the second floor press office windows onto the expansive white wall grids that separate the variety of booths that that will soon come alive with a remarkable display of creative diversity, the gigantic interior space is buzzing like a beehive with workers and hard hat soldiers maneuvering large custom made crates on forklifts zooming in all directions. It's clear the LA Art Show, now in its 19th year, is no ordinary art fair, which in the last few years has drawn the attention and participation from major, celebrated galleries like Ace Gallery. Once inside the exhibition area, it's necessary to have a pathway map to guide you intelligently and efficiently to the areas you want to explore. This year, the LA Art Show is divided into three distinct categories, which helps to zero in on what you want to see: a modern & contemporary section; a historic & traditional section; and the International Fine Print Dealers Association (IFPDA)-sponsored Los Angeles Fine Print Fair. Toss in an ambitious speakers program (that I also participated in) titled Dialogs LA, ongoing special events and receptions and the adjoining Los Angeles Jewelry Antique & Design Show that sponsored a museum quality exhibition in conjunction with the La Ruta Maya Foundation, which showcases more than 159 superb cultural treasures from the classic period of Mayan civilization, and you've got one helluva exciting opportunity to have a great experience. I was impressed with the overall quality of the LA Art Show exhibitors, and as an art collector myself, would have been happy to wrap up at least 25 paintings and objects and ship them off to my home in West Palm Beach had my budget allowed it. All it takes is money and there was plenty of that being exchanged, judging by the number of red dots that decorated many of the booth walls. There's certainly something for everyone at the show, but here's a check list of some of my personal favorites:Craig Alan's curious method of depicting famous faces such as Elvis or Marilyn Monroe utilizes a small army of congregated people carefully painted onto wide open spaces, stopped at just the right moment in time to offer a recognizable and dramatic portrait, like a cloud passing by that's sure to dissolve into thin air at any moment. Alan often experiments by looking down upon real people in a courtyard, watching them mill about until a good image inspiration strikes him for a painterly aerial view, which later can be delicately transferred into deceptively complicated compositions. Guarisco Gallery: www.guariscogallery.com  Craig Alan, Marilyn Demure (on iridescent background), 2013, oil on canvas, 48 x 60 in. framed. Courtesy Guarisco Gallery.Abby M. Taylor Fine Art exhibited a splendid work by the late abstractionist Robert Arthur Goodnough, whose intricate compositions of small triangular forms are reminiscent of flags, a flock of birds or designs of falling leaves. Celebrated art critics like Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg had a tough time trying to pigeonhole this fine artist into an abstract expressionist fraternity; a permanent label couldn't stick as the artist never allowed his work to be constrained to the limits of any movement. Grey, Pink with Colors is one of the finest examples of Goodnough's best years. Abby M.

Taylor Fine Art.The Paul Fisher Gallery showcased the collage-based work of William Moloney, featuring a series of handsome, large-scale ink transfer compositions that were among the most interesting findings at the fair. In one remarkable work titled The End of the Left/Right Paradigm, Moloney builds an imaginary stage set that depicts an elephant on the right (no coincidence) and a donkey on the left, who are spinning on a black and white turnstile as a puppeteer's gloved hands manipulate their political directions. The audience of lambs in the front row are sheepishly mesmerized by the performance as the art house starts to collapse.

From a distance, the celebrated and historic Ace Gallery looked as though it might be a target range for the nearsighted, as a work portraying giant concentric circles seemed to vibrate with a curious magnetic field stimulated by rows of harmonious color combinations. Gary Lang's work seems to be a transference of humanity, which takes you into a self-made vortex that the artist has meticulously hand-painted. These towering works are almost extraterrestrial, as they completely overwhelm the viewer in a meditative concert of reverberating rings that start to play tricks on the mind. As a star of the so-called light and space movement, these are simply remarkable examples of creating a hypnotic spirit that's hard to forget.

Photo courtesy Ace Gallery.Michael Borghi Fine Art presented sexy, pop, collaged canvases by hotshot Tom Dash, who experienced a sold out show during the recent Art Basel Miami Beach, and it's easy to see why. The images are singularly provocative and now are becoming iconic. Dash's strongest influence comes from his activities as the lead assistant to Richard Prince (2005-2011). With significant life experiences that were unusually exceptional added to his formal training, including that received at RISD, he now masterfully utilizes techniques to illustrate social issues, music and popular culture themes.

She was the first artist to live and work in an industrial loft in the Cast Iron neighborhood called SoHo, which offered her an endless supply of raw materials that eventually were cemented together to create her distinctive sculpture. Timothy Yarger Fine Art seems to have cornered the market on Nevelson's pieces, including on view a superb collection of collages from the same period. Classic and hauntingly beautiful, these works are timeless. Timothy Yarger Fine Art: www.yargerfinearts.com  Louise Nevelson, Untitled, 1963, cardboard, foil, paper collage on board, 36 x 24 in. Courtesy Timothy Yarger Fine Art.  The Spanish artist Jordi Alcaraz amazed fair-goers with his surprisingly elegant act of courage and invention that deals with reflection, transparency, space, process and absolute abstraction, and are evocatively poetic. As a visual alchemist, he defies optics by poking and punching away at sacred concepts, turning things upside down. In the hands of a lesser artist, these works could fall into banality. If Antoni Tàpies was the master of walls and doors, Alcaraz is the artist who allows us to travel through them into an eternal dimension.

The Valentine Ryabov Gallery from Moscow, Russia presented an sophisticated display of riveting new works by Sergey Fedotov, who has somehow mastered the impossible homemade recipe of combining abstract expressionism with distinctly narrative components. Fedotov's painting titled Uglich City is a charming illustration of a creative work of art on several intellectual levels that might have not seemed possible until now. Other works that offer a glimpse at flower arrangements, portraits and country landscapes also are consistently inventive and powerfully dramatic.

Courtesy Valentine Ryabov Gallery.Surely one of the most striking images in the fair was an Incan ceremonial mantle made of fine, hand-spun cotton threads (1400-1532 AD), which was unearthed in the Atacama Desert in Peru in almost pristine condition, hermetically sealed in a ceramic container, and then later mounted on board. It's not only the stark, minimal inherent beauty of this piece that makes it purely radiant, but its ironic strength and longevity has a clear unintended connection to the contemporary proportions and design of vintage works by artists like Kenneth Noland and Jasper Johns. Even without the obvious references, this work is simply one of the most handsome on display in the fair. William Siegal Gallery: www.williamsiegal.com  Striped Ceremonial Mantle, 1400-1532 AD, Inca Culture - Peru, natural cotton, 67 x 108 in. Courtesy William Siegal Gallery.A delightful discovery was the collection of galleries selected by Noah Antieau of Red Truck Gallery for the special section titled Littletopia, where a common denominator of outsider energy and eccentric paintings and sculpture produced obvious enthusiasm from the crowds of folks who stopped to talk with some of the artists and their dealers. Sloan Fine Art presented Brad Woodfin of Montreal, who paints with a secret passion and obsession for wildlife and offers a realistic reminder of how we are losing an increasing variety of species. In this salon style installation of different shapes, the artist infuses some humanity with old fashioned and skillfully articulated portraits of creatures who are in danger of extinction. Others of interest in this collection are Susan Siegel, a vegetarian who repositions animals in Victorian wedding gear at a solemn garden party, and Jessicka Addams, who could be related to the real Addams Family and creates self-portraits that reference near death personal experiences with a witty, macabre slant. ""Hey buddy, got an artful match?"" might be a question to Jason D'Aquino regarding his remarkable miniature drawing on the inside of a real matchbook. This curious object qualified for a nomination to ""Ripey's Believe it or Not"" and was simply striking! Red Truck Gallery stole the show with an amazing variety of folkish carvings and imagery worthy of great sideshow banners.

Courtesy Sloan Fine Art.Altamira Fine Art, in Scottsdale, Arizona and Jackson, Wyoming, not surprisingly had a distinct western slant with works by Bill Schenck of a double-crossed, gun-toting, modern cowboy and Fritz Scholder, who is highly respected for his contemporary interpretations of western themes, especially abstract portraits of Native Americans. A pleasant surprise was encountering Scholder's simple, painted black-line rendition of a giant desert flower that took on the character of an expressionist master, complete with a generous helping of strategic drips. His classic signature at the bottom is the best looking in the business! Altamira Fine Art: www.altamiraart.com  Susan Siegel, Gary and Judy, 2013, oil on linen, 12 x12 in. Courtesy Sloan Fine Art.William A. Karges Fine Art presented an exceptionally handsome selection of turn-of-the-century paintings that were rich in traditionally educated talent and reminiscent of the best period for sophisticated compositions. My favorite was Thomas Anshutz's Portrait of Rebecca Whelan (c. 1908), where the artist makes magic with reflected light on a charming Victorian woman accented by a nearly black background. The pose is delightful and so is the outfit, with a stunning feathered hat and a striking bright orange pattern on her dress. This is the classic kind of image that may have influenced John Currin to take the next step with a dash of erotic spice. The picture also reminds me of my dear friend Irina, whose love of rare parrots also is reflected in this romantic little cameo image. William A. Karges Fine Art: www.kargesfineart.com  Jessicka Addams, Ecstasy, 2014, mixed media (thread, acrylic on panel), 12 x12 in. Courtesy Sloan Fine Art.With over 18,000 items on display from over 135 dealers, it's impossible to cover even a small sampling of images, but suffice to say the best way to get an accurate perspective is to get on the road and see for yourself. On opening night about 7,000 guests, including Barbra Streisand, made the opening one of the most memorable and lucrative in recent memory. Naturally, the show draws a huge segment of the nearby Hollywood community, which is unique to any art fair on the planet and adds an extra dimension to the crowd and big business to the dealers. Bring a comfortable pair of snappy shoes and get ready for a visual adventure. On my way out of the convention center mid-afternoon Friday, the crowds had temporarily thinned, and I spotted the new ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" Leonardo DiCaprio, discreetly entering the fair with a show catalog and a smile. As an art collector I'm sure he'll not go home empty-handed. The LA Art Show (www.laartshow.com) closes Sunday, January 19 at 5:00pm.

Grey, Pink with Colors is one of the finest examples of Goodnough's best years. Abby M.

Taylor Fine Art.The Paul Fisher Gallery showcased the collage-based work of William Moloney, featuring a series of handsome, large-scale ink transfer compositions that were among the most interesting findings at the fair. In one remarkable work titled The End of the Left/Right Paradigm, Moloney builds an imaginary stage set that depicts an elephant on the right (no coincidence) and a donkey on the left, who are spinning on a black and white turnstile as a puppeteer's gloved hands manipulate their political directions. The audience of lambs in the front row are sheepishly mesmerized by the performance as the art house starts to collapse.

From a distance, the celebrated and historic Ace Gallery looked as though it might be a target range for the nearsighted, as a work portraying giant concentric circles seemed to vibrate with a curious magnetic field stimulated by rows of harmonious color combinations. Gary Lang's work seems to be a transference of humanity, which takes you into a self-made vortex that the artist has meticulously hand-painted. These towering works are almost extraterrestrial, as they completely overwhelm the viewer in a meditative concert of reverberating rings that start to play tricks on the mind. As a star of the so-called light and space movement, these are simply remarkable examples of creating a hypnotic spirit that's hard to forget.

Photo courtesy Ace Gallery.Michael Borghi Fine Art presented sexy, pop, collaged canvases by hotshot Tom Dash, who experienced a sold out show during the recent Art Basel Miami Beach, and it's easy to see why. The images are singularly provocative and now are becoming iconic. Dash's strongest influence comes from his activities as the lead assistant to Richard Prince (2005-2011). With significant life experiences that were unusually exceptional added to his formal training, including that received at RISD, he now masterfully utilizes techniques to illustrate social issues, music and popular culture themes.

She was the first artist to live and work in an industrial loft in the Cast Iron neighborhood called SoHo, which offered her an endless supply of raw materials that eventually were cemented together to create her distinctive sculpture. Timothy Yarger Fine Art seems to have cornered the market on Nevelson's pieces, including on view a superb collection of collages from the same period. Classic and hauntingly beautiful, these works are timeless. Timothy Yarger Fine Art: www.yargerfinearts.com  Louise Nevelson, Untitled, 1963, cardboard, foil, paper collage on board, 36 x 24 in.

The Spanish artist Jordi Alcaraz amazed fair-goers with his surprisingly elegant act of courage and invention that deals with reflection, transparency, space, process and absolute abstraction, and are evocatively poetic. As a visual alchemist, he defies optics by poking and punching away at sacred concepts, turning things upside down. In the hands of a lesser artist, these works could fall into banality. If Antoni Tàpies was the master of walls and doors, Alcaraz is the artist who allows us to travel through them into an eternal dimension.

The Valentine Ryabov Gallery from Moscow, Russia presented an sophisticated display of riveting new works by Sergey Fedotov, who has somehow mastered the impossible homemade recipe of combining abstract expressionism with distinctly narrative components. Fedotov's painting titled Uglich City is a charming illustration of a creative work of art on several intellectual levels that might have not seemed possible until now. Other works that offer a glimpse at flower arrangements, portraits and country landscapes also are consistently inventive and powerfully dramatic.

Courtesy Valentine Ryabov Gallery.Surely one of the most striking images in the fair was an Incan ceremonial mantle made of fine, hand-spun cotton threads (1400-1532 AD), which was unearthed in the Atacama Desert in Peru in almost pristine condition, hermetically sealed in a ceramic container, and then later mounted on board. It's not only the stark, minimal inherent beauty of this piece that makes it purely radiant, but its ironic strength and longevity has a clear unintended connection to the contemporary proportions and design of vintage works by artists like Kenneth Noland and Jasper Johns. Even without the obvious references, this work is simply one of the most handsome on display in the fair.

Sloan Fine Art presented Brad Woodfin of Montreal, who paints with a secret passion and obsession for wildlife and offers a realistic reminder of how we are losing an increasing variety of species. In this salon style installation of different shapes, the artist infuses some humanity with old fashioned and skillfully articulated portraits of creatures who are in danger of extinction. Others of interest in this collection are Susan Siegel, a vegetarian who repositions animals in Victorian wedding gear at a solemn garden party, and Jessicka Addams, who could be related to the real Addams Family and creates self-portraits that reference near death personal experiences with a witty, macabre slant. ""Hey buddy, got an artful match?"" might be a question to Jason D'Aquino regarding his remarkable miniature drawing on the inside of a real matchbook. This curious object qualified for a nomination to ""Ripey's Believe it or Not"" and was simply striking! Red Truck Gallery stole the show with an amazing variety of folkish carvings and imagery worthy of great sideshow banners.

A pleasant surprise was encountering Scholder's simple, painted black-line rendition of a giant desert flower that took on the character of an expressionist master, complete with a generous helping of strategic drips. His classic signature at the bottom is the best looking in the business! Altamira Fine Art: www.altamiraart.com  Susan Siegel, Gary and Judy, 2013, oil on linen, 12 x12 in. Courtesy Sloan Fine Art.William A. Karges Fine Art presented an exceptionally handsome selection of turn-of-the-century paintings that were rich in traditionally educated talent and reminiscent of the best period for sophisticated compositions. My favorite was Thomas Anshutz's Portrait of Rebecca Whelan (c. 1908), where the artist makes magic with reflected light on a charming Victorian woman accented by a nearly black background. The pose is delightful and so is the outfit, with a stunning feathered hat and a striking bright orange pattern on her dress. This is the classic kind of image that may have influenced John Currin to take the next step with a dash of erotic spice. The picture also reminds me of my dear friend Irina, whose love of rare parrots also is reflected in this romantic little cameo image. William A.

Courtesy Sloan Fine Art.With over 18,000 items on display from over 135 dealers, it's impossible to cover even a small sampling of images, but suffice to say the best way to get an accurate perspective is to get on the road and see for yourself. On opening night about 7,000 guests, including Barbra Streisand, made the opening one of the most memorable and lucrative in recent memory. Naturally, the show draws a huge segment of the nearby Hollywood community, which is unique to any art fair on the planet and adds an extra dimension to the crowd and big business to the dealers. Bring a comfortable pair of snappy shoes and get ready for a visual adventure. On my way out of the convention center mid-afternoon Friday, the crowds had temporarily thinned, and I spotted the new ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" Leonardo DiCaprio, discreetly entering the fair with a show catalog and a smile. As an art collector I'm sure he'll not go home empty-handed. The LA Art Show (www.laartshow.com) closes Sunday, January 19 at 5:00pm.
