In this excerpt, Stryker looks at how certain groups and individuals are creating new platforms that promote open communication online.Rip It Up and Start AgainAfter its big leak of U.S. diplomatic cables into the public domain, WikiLeaks has had some trouble finding a Web hosting company. This is nothing new. Service providers tend to err on the side of safety when it comes to provocative geopolitical doings. It's a common frustration among self-described freedom fighters. So far we've examined how anonymous activists are picking away at different properties of the Web. Some try to make sure advertisers can't track us. Others aim to put restrictions on government surveillance. Some build cryptography tools that mask traffic.The most extreme activists are tired of trying to reform what they consider to be an irrevocably broken system. As the Internet becomes a more lucrative ground for corporate interests, the likelihood of censorship of inflammatory content increases. Which is why some techies are trying to scrap the Internet we have and build a new one. One of them, a Swedish man named Peter Sunde, recently tweeted, ""Hello all ISPs [Internet Service Providers] of the world. We're going to add a new competing root-server since we're tired of ICANN [the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]. Please contact me to help.""Over the last few years, the entertainment industry has been turned upside down, first by Napster, LimeWire, and their ilk. Now, they are being usurped by a peer-to-peer file-sharing scheme that, without a central hub, can't be taken off-line by fiat. It's called BitTorrent. One of the most prominent BitTorrent sites is The Pirate Bay. Its founders, a young and appropriately snotty group of geeks, have somehow managed to keep the site up and running over the last nine years. One of those men is Peter Sunde, who fired off the above salvo on Twitter on November 28, 2010. Sunde is an anti-copyright activist based in Sweden, a country where legal loopholes have so far allowed him to escape imprisonment due to his involvement with The Pirate Bay. In a blog post that followed, Sunde wrote, ""We haven't organized yet, but are trying to... we want the Internet to be uncensored. Having a centralized system that controls our information flow is not acceptable.""And so Sunde and his cohorts want to create a new Internet, one that utilizes the power of decentralized file sharing they perfected with The Pirate Bay. They have no use for ICANN, which oversees the entire Internet's Domain Name System (DNS). When a government decides that a Web site within its borders needs to come down, ICANN makes it happen. The DNS is comprised of thirteen root servers located throughout the world that essentially enable ICANN to shut down access to a site at the touch of a button. Critics have decried ICANN's monopoly for years for being inefficient and under the control of strong special interests. Cypherpunk John Gilmore has been an especially vocal voice of opposition, and PGP creator Philip Zimmerman also expressed disappointment with the organization when I spoke with him:Something has gone wrong with ICANN. Creation of larger and larger numbers of top-level domains seems to be extortion. I already own PhilipZimmerman.com. Am I compelled to buy PhilipZimmerman.biz and PhilipZimmerman.whatever? I'm not sure the old way was stable in the long term, where everything was controlled by an American institution. Now we've turned over control of these top-level domains to individual countries' governments. And that is going to hurt a lot of people because these governments will do things that are not in the interest of their people. The world is worse off now since that transition.Sunde hopes to create an alternative to ICANN, one that uses the same peer-to-peer technology that brought the entertainment industry to its knees. Each user will host a portion of a DNS on his own home computer, so that ICANN no longer wields absolute power in the domain space.Sunde isn't the only one aiming to route around ICANN's control through technology rather than policy change. Another group has created Dot-BIT, which uses proxies and cryptography to move domains around anonymously. It's not quite part of the darknet (it's been called a ""dimnet""), but it's not out in the open either like the rest of the Web you and I are familiar with. It has already registered several thousand .bit domains, which can only be accessed by those using a special proxy service.Dot-BIT is driven by Namecoins, a domain-related ""currency"" that can be earned or ""mined"" by contributing your computer's processing power to the network. Users can also purchase Namecoins with cash or bitcoins. Namecoins are used to anonymously purchase a domain within the Dot-BIT network. This incentivizes participants to help keep the network afloat.However, the Dot-BIT network, not being a pure darknet, is still vulnerable to censorship by ISPs, who could easily block traffic to .bit domains if compelled to do so. Dot-BIT also lacks the pure anonymity of, say, Tor's .onion network, so it's not the model for a totally free, open Internet that someone like Sunde is looking for.Liam Young and a group called Tomorrow's Thoughts Today, inspired by uprisings in the Middle East, developed a robotics project involving a fleet of flying drones, each transmitting wireless signals between two hundred and three hundred meters. The group of hovering hotspots is able to swarm into formation and disperse in order to escape detection. They recharge themselves autonomously, flying to a recharge station when low on power.The effort to create an alternate Internet is still dependant on an extant infrastructure, usually owned by big corporations or governments. So in the event of a complete global network crackdown, unlikely as it may be, these valiant efforts would be for naught. That's why a group of perhaps romantic techies are thinking about alternative infrastructure in the form of satellite networking. Berlin's Chaos Communication Congress and the Hackerspace Global Grid have outlined a project to develop communication satellites that would be put into orbit above the atmosphere. They claim to be aiming for an ""uncensorable Internet in space.""No sovereign entity has claimed to own space... yet. Of course, speaking in admittedly paranoid hypotheticals, if tyranny became so widespread and comprehensive that it became necessary to turn to satellites, it's likely that such an evil government would figure out a way to shoot them down or otherwise disable them. Regardless, it's an ambitious project, fraught with technical complications. For one thing, low-earth satellites orbit the earth every ninety minutes or so, which means that they can only communicate with a ground station while the satellite is ""in view."" Stationary satellites would have to be placed farther above the atmosphere, which would create a signal delay, prohibitive for many Web applications. For many hackers involved in the project, free-speech concerns are an auxiliary goal. They just want to explore space and are tired of waiting for decades, relying on underfunded, inefficient space programs to get the job done."

Does this mean we succumb to the pressure of spending a fortune on camp so that our children can program iPhones at the tender age of 10?,2012-09-14,Cheerful smiling child at the blackboard. School concept,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2bce3c00004c0009a924.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Thomas Friedman recently went on ""The Brian Lehrer Show"" and announced that ""there is no more average."" Citing statistics about the connection between unemployment and education, Friedman said that the less educated you are and the less spectacular you are, the less likely you are to succeed in this new technology-driven world of ours.Of course, I went right to thinking about my own children, and while those children are mere babies -- 8 and 3 years old -- I couldn't help but think what this means for their future. I'm not the only parent thinking about how technology can influence our children -- in fact, a new study by Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics of Kansas City, Mo., said 83 percent of parents believed the benefits outweighed the risks of social media, and that social media was ""good preparation for future involvement in a technology-dependent work world.""Now, I'm not sure I entirely subscribe to this -- mostly I think Facebook for kids is just an easier way to brag or bully one another -- we do owe it to our children to make sure they are on the ""cutting edge"" of technology. So, what does being on the cutting edge really mean? Does this mean we succumb to the pressure of spending a fortune on a camp like this one so that our children can program iPhones at the young age of 10? (Granted, the camp looks fantastic.) Or does it mean we have to drag them to DefCon camp so they can learn to hack away at complicated codes? I thought about this while watching television with my 8-year-old recently. Specifically, while watching Adventure Time, a show on Cartoon Network about a boy named Finn and his sidekick, Jake, a magical dog. Though there is an overall theme about an existentialist quest I'm not exactly sure I follow, Finn and Jake mostly a fight psychopathic introvert/evil emperor, the Ice King, who is forever attempting to kidnap a woman named Princess Bubblegum and make her his wife.I turned to my son Jake and said, ""The creators of this show have a wild imagination.""""Yep,"" he said.""Think you might want to create your own world?""""Not really,"" he said, and turned up the volume.But my anxiety about directing my child into an above-average world overruled his lack-of interest. Why should he be a passive watcher when he can be a leader? I kissed his little arm. This world will be so frighteningly more competitive in just ten years, honey, I thought. iPhones will be replaced by some other concept phone/internet/Star Trek transporter. So I opened my laptop, found a free comic book maker and signed up. Since my son is easily convinced by anything with the word ""computer"" -- as in, ""Want to watch this tutorial about how to make your own comic book on my computer?"" -- he was easily engaged. And in watching him manipulate the characters arms and re-size backgrounds, I couldn't help but think about how my kid would one day have the skills to animate his own Cartoon Network show with the skills that he was learning from this program. He'd win awards! He'd become a mentor for Pixar! He'd be the next Garry Trudeau! Or maybe I was simply helping him develop his interests. And that's nice too."

You've dated for less than a year. Most people are on their best behavior,2012-09-14,"QUESTION: Which singer said that her wedding plans were ""moving a little too fast"" before she called off the wedding completely?",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9bb93e250000360035cd55.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"By Christina Steinorth for YourTango.comYou would be surprised how many women going through divorces tell me they knew they were making a mistake when they walked down the aisle — in more recent headlines, Kim Kardashian even shared this similar sentiment. Below are five warning signs you may want to consider before saying ""I do.""1. You don't get along with his family. Many couples go through with weddings hoping all the family stuff will ""just work out."" Don't fall into this trap because it seldom does. In fact, issues with in-laws tend to get worse over time — especially when babies come along. If his family is causing a problem in your relationship before you're married, you may want to give serious thought to calling off your wedding.2. You've dated for less than a year. Most people are on their best behavior for the first twelve months of a relationship. After that, people tend to let their guard down a little bit and you get to see what a person is really like. This is important because ideally when you get married, you will be spending the rest of your lives together — you will need to know if your partner is someone you can live with on a day-to-day, long-term basis after the honeymoon phase of your relationship is over.3. You haven't come to an agreement about kids, careers and other fundamental issues. So many couples get caught up in wedding planning, that they forget to talk about the fundamental issues of sharing a life together. Will you have kids? How many? What religion will you raise your children? Where will you live? Will one of you be a stay at home parent? How will holidays be handled? How will housework be divided?Couples should spend at least as much time paying attention to the details of their lives together as they do to the details of their weddings. If you can't come to an agreement to these types of fundamental issues before your marriage, you should consider calling off your wedding until you reach a mutually acceptable agreement on the details of your lives together.4. You lack conflict resolution skills. A lot of couples write off arguments before a wedding as ""wedding day jitters,"" but the truth of the matter is that if you have horrendous arguments and fights with your partner and nothing ever seems to get resolved, you may want to consider calling off your wedding until the two of you work on your conflict resolution skills. Long-term relationships require good conflict resolution skills and the good news is that they can be learned if both couples are committed to doing so.5. Your gut feeling is telling you to call it off. We have gut feelings for a reason and where most of us get into trouble is when we don't listen to them. If your gut feeling is telling you to call of your wedding, it's probably a good idea to listen to that feeling and at the very least postpone your wedding until the feeling goes away. If you are meant to be together, that current gut feeling that is telling you ""don't do it,"" will eventually pass.Christina Steinorth, MA, MFT is a private practice Psychotherapist and the Author of ""Cue Cards for Life: Thoughtful Tips for Better Relationships.""

4,WELLNESS,McDonald's Adds Calorie Counts To Menus: But Will It Work?,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mcdonalds-calorie-counts-nutrition_us_5b9c481ee4b03a1dcc7d8c5c,The researchers evaluated New York City patrons before and after calorie counts were made mandatory and then looked at a,2012-09-14,"FILE - In this July 18, 2008 file photo, calories of each food item appear on a McDonalds drive-thru menu in New York. Calorie counts will have to be listed on restaurant menus under a provision tucked into the massive health care overhaul bill. (AP Photo/Ed Ou, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c481e3c0000320009b352.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"McDonald's announced this week that they would begin posting calorie counts on their restaurant and drive-thru menus, nation-wide.The move preempts a stipulation that's part of the federal health care bill, in which restaurant chains with more than 20 locations will be required to post calories in their stores. And though the national aspect of the law is new, McDonald's has been posting calories in cities with a municipal law requiring them -- such as New York City and Philadelphia -- and in some foreign countries that require the same, including Australia, South Korea and the U.K. The logic behind the idea of calorie posting is that it will educate consumers about how many calories they are about to eat, in the hopes that this will, in turn, curb problems related to overeating, like obesity and diabetes. Margo Wootan, director of nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest told the AP that she also believed the calorie lists would provide some industry regulation, as corporations would be embarrassed to list sky-high calorie counts for their diet-busting sandwiches and other items. But will the move actually have an effect on our behavior and on our waistlines? In places like New York City, where publicly listed calorie counts have been mandated since 2008, an unintended testing ground has provided some insight for public health researchers, who haven't necessarily found the dramatic reaction they'd hoped for. One New York University School of Medicine study conducted in 2011 of adult-accompanied children and teens of four chain restaurants in low-income neighborhoods found that, although customers took note of the calories listed on the menu, their receipts indicated that they bought no fewer calories at the register. The researchers evaluated New York City patrons before and after calorie counts were made mandatory and then looked at a comparison group in Newark, NJ, where no such law went into effect. Half of the teens took note of the calories, but continued to purchase an average 725 per register trip. What's more, 25 percent of parents who were buying children's meals noted the calories, but continued to purchase about 600 calories at a time for their youngsters. In an initial study from the same research group in 2009, Dr. Brian Elbel and colleagues found that the number of calories purchased actually rose after the calorie counts went into effect: from 825 per purchase before the listed calories to 846 after listing. On the other hand, in another study of teens in low-income neighborhoods, this time in Baltimore, researchers found that posting calorie counts near beverage cases had a profound effect on purchasing decisions. In fact, the teens were 40 percent less likely to buy a full-calorie drink after seeing the number listed than they were when no such information was in the store. Still, in yet another study, researchers from Stanford University found that Starbucks customers bought, on average, six percent fewer calories per trip after New York City's 2008 law went into effect. For comparison's sake, the researchers looked at Philadelphia and Boston, where there was no change in calories. Interestingly, people didn't budge on their beverages of choice, but instead either bought less food or chose lower-calorie food options. Of note, the researchers -- from the Graduate School of Business -- found that the reduction in calories didn't mean less revenue, in fact, for stores with a close-by competitor, posting calorie information actually boosted sales. Would seeing the calories make you change your order? Tell us in the comments below. "
