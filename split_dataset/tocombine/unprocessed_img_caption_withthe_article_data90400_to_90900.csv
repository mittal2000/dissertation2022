The United States Air Force currently has 116 of the aircraft in its UAS fleet with 31 of them airborne at any given moment, flying combat air patrols over Iraq and Afghanistan. After being launched overseas, the Predators are flown by pilots and sensor operators from ground control stations at Creech and four Air National Guard units in the Unites States. In addition to carrying two laser-guided Hellfire missiles, the Predators have cameras that provide full-motion video that is in high demand for use in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. The demand for the aircraft was highlighted in February when the Air Force reached the milestone of 500,000 flying hours for the Predator. It took 12 years to reach 250,000 flying hours and only about two years to double it. It is expected that the Air Force will reach one million flying hours in less than three years.

Critics pressed drones' dangerous secrecy and fallibility and the political backlash they produce in the Muslim world. The administration reached for platitudes about the sad inevitability of mistakes in the ""fog of war."" Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations and author of a 2013 study of drones predicted, ""even this episode will have no effect"" on public debate -- and our easy distraction since Friday has proven him right. Critics point to strong bipartisan support for drones as the reason for this inertia. But persistent questioning is all the more urgent because studies show that this apparent support arises out of a fundamental, deliberately propagated misunderstanding about how drones are used. According to a 2013 study, while most Americans approve drone strikes targeting high-level terrorist targets, they disapprove that recourse when there is the possibility of civilian deaths. In short, most Americans would disapprove the current use of drones if it were ever properly aired. High-ranking military and diplomatic officials I have spoken to indicate that the problem is not military commitment to the drone strategy but our civilian leadership's commitment to it. Within the Air Force especially, skepticism about the tactic arises from the way CIA and the Joint Special Operations Command's independent, secret use of drones fatally compromises Air Force use of them.I toured Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, where the USAF drones are remotely piloted. I was pressed afterwards not to disclose the circumstances of the tour. I do not have much faith in the reasoning behind keeping them secret, but some deluded sense of honor ties my tongue, redoubled by my sensitivity as a South-Asian-American to suspicions of my patriotism after I was warned that describing the circumstances would somehow endanger the security of our service men and women (although arguably disclosure in the name of democracy is patriotic duty, too).Such are the liabilities of being a hyphenated American with ancestral ties to the geography being bombed. My son, whose name happens to have an Arabic root, was put on a Homeland Security no-fly list despite being self-evidently three years old. These are real-life worries, and so I compromise.More significantly, that I did visit the base but was censored from writing about it suggests the military is playing a double-game, inviting public oversight on its own terms to safely air its doubts about the drone strategy while its siege mentality prevents a full and clear airing of them as part of real public debate.While criticism remains episodic and marginal, the men and women who run operations at Creech are in thrall to Orientalist notions about the ""culture"" of people in the AfPak region. Thus, for example, some believe Afghani men are indifferent to the death of women and children without considering that Americans might appear similarly indifferent to Afghanis given our own evident tolerance of civilian deaths there. Orientalist notions about the terrain's otherworldliness are also in play, situating it somewhere beyond the pale of civilization where al Qaeda finds sanctuary and thus where drone use can be countenanced in a way it would not be tolerated elsewhere. Indeed, romantic descriptions of a fantastically remote, thickly-forested valley surrounded by snow-capped peaks ran through the New York Times coverage of the American hostage's death in the Shawal Valley. I have written extensively about how our military inherited these views from the British who first attempted to police the region from the air after World War I. They are crucial to drone operators' ability to press the trigger, keeping the region permanently unreal and alien, an eternal frontier-zone where civilization ends and something else, ungovernable, begins. As much as defenders of drone strikes tout the hours of close surveillance that give remote pilots a kind of intimacy with their victims, in fact, one-way surveillance of that kind is not aimed at producing empathy but greater confidence in the target's presumptive otherness. Creech's motto is ""Home of the Hunters,"" and the first hunter-killer drone is called the ""Predator."" Every good hunter must know its prey's habits well, but we would never mistake that intimate knowledge for empathy.The ugly truth is that our official policy is to count all dead as militants -- that is how we dispensed with the matter of civilian casualties until last week's inconvenient news of the deaths of an American hostage and Italian aid worker. The cause of this absurd policy is not lack of civilian oversight of the military but lack of democratic oversight of our civilian leadership. The day after the New York Times remarked the folly of drone tactics revealed by the death of an innocent American, the paper fawned over the program's decimation of al Qaeda leadership -- feebly in the end, for the article had to admit that al Qaeda has declined primarily because would-be militants prefer ISIS, hardly a development our drone strategists should be proud of. It is time for us, as Americans, to exercise our responsibility as citizens and take control of the debate. Our leadership does not want journalists demanding revelatory tours of Creech. Journalists and citizens, demand a tour. At the very least, demand an account of and an apology for every civilian death. Drones routinely terrorize and kill civilians. Is this American culture?"

As Musk teases, ""For the future to be good, we need electric transport, solar power and..."" So why does Musk call battery storage ""the missing piece"" and why is it so significant?Last week, I sat down with Tesla board member, Steve Jurvetson and we discussed why these new products will make such synergistic sense for Tesla. He describes how the powerful troika of Tesla, SolarCity and the Gigafactory will work. This missing piece has the potential to revolutionize the clean energy industry and disrupt grid energy as we know it.Here's an edited transcript of our conversation. You can listen to the full interview at Fresh Dialogues.Alison van Diggelen: Give us the case for battery storage. Why is Tesla going into battery storage for the home and utility scale?Steve Jurvetson: This may be the first peek into a unified theme across companies...Elon Musk is an incredibly prolific entrepreneur, having come up with, or been at the founding team of Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity, PayPal, all different industries that seem to have nothing to do with each other.Now the troika of SolarCity, and the Gigafactory and Tesla comes into light for the first time: There is synergy. Say 20 years out, there'll be a distributed utility where Solarcity has the solar cell installation, leasing and basically ownership, installation and the whole shebang, actually building panels as well for solar on homes, everywhere.Well, once you get enough of that - last I checked they have around 40% market share in the US - you start to generate so much energy that you are like a variety of utilities combined, but it's ephemeral. If you're not using that energy when generated, it goes away. So right now, you push it to the grid and it's expected the utility can use it, especially since solar is produced at peak hours. But what if you wanted to get rid of the grid altogether? You'd need distributed storage ...if every solar cell came with a big battery that could smooth out your daily needs, then you could just disconnect from the grid. You could certainly lower the generation capacity of the grid...that pushes on fossil fuels and nuclear.How to pull that off? As a customer of Tesla and SolarCity I see my solar cells and I see my car and think, can't we just connect these together? If I need to suck energy out of my car, I can use it to buffer the load from my cells, but it's not so easy...Part of the synergy and leverage is that Tesla is planning to build an enormous plant of batteries, anticipating the 3rd generation vehicle...you're going to have some excess capacity, potentially for some period of time as you ramp up.There will be blocks when you produce a lot more batteries than you might need in that particular month... what are other interesting things you can do with them? What would you do with those batteries at the end of life of a car? Those battery packs are really useful for secondary storage uses.The Gigafactory isn't named that just out of hubris. It would be the largest factory in the world by footprint and they're going to eventually build many of them.That one factory alone at scale would exceed global capacity today. So this is an unfathomable amount of batteries. I really have to credit Elon for realizing that these numbers pencil out to be so enormous and to share that with the world, before he had the solution in the bag.van Diggelen: Talk about the utility scale side. If you were a utility...(say) in charge of PG&E today, talk about how you'd be feeling and what you might be doing to deal with this?Jurvetson: On the one hand, you're threatened by solar and you're going to do all your dastardly deeds to try to quench and kill innovation, because that's what big companies do, it's in their blood. That's what they're expected to do.But on the other hand, they need this too because whether by mandate or the goodness of their hearts...so mandate...they do more wind, do more solar. Many of those wind farms you see, on Pacheco Pass, they're not doing anything useful. They may be spinning but they're not even hooked up sometimes. There are rules and regulations to generate the capacity but not to actually make use of it. So part of the problem with time shifting is you have different needs at different times, wind is often a nighttime peak, so storage is needed throughout to pump water...there are all kinds of things you can do....in demand response. There's a lot of inefficiencies in the utilities where they'll build peaking gas fired power plants that are just turned on for a few hours in the year at most for those peak needs. So all that infrastructure just because you couldn't do needs sharing or have the capacity to buffer.If you had big old battery sitting there on the grid, you wouldn't need that. So distributing that allows you to put it near the point of consumption and point of generation in a solar context.van Diggelen: What are the markets for these utility scale batteries? Would it be companies like Apple that are going solar in a big way or is it to sell to PG&E?Jurvetson: Good question. In general, there's a whole cascade of markets: everything from consumers for their home, businesses and utilities themselves. The utilities can go to all kinds of technologies, even telcos like for a cell phone tower, you need storage there as well, especially in places like India and elsewhere.There are technologies like flow cell batteries, compressed air solutions being developed...there is a variety of ways to approach this. Tesla's approach is just leveraging what they know best which is lithium ion chemistry and batteries and a battery management system...so you can potentially address a whole range of these.van Diggelen: So it's the same batteries they use in their car?Jurvetson: Exactly...*** The interview took place at the Commonwealth Club, Silicon Valley on April 21 2015.

Randy Boehning (R) has come out as a member of the LGBT community after he was caught sending explicit photos on a gay dating app.Boehning, who voted against a bill earlier this month that would extend housing, workplace and other protections to LGBT North Dakota residents, revealed to The Forum this week that he is attracted to both men and women. Boehning's revelation came two weeks after he originally declined to comment on information provided to The Forum that appeared to show that the lawmaker used Grindr, a gay dating app. ""The 1,000-pound gorilla has been lifted,"" he told The Forum on Monday, confirming to the outlet that he had used the app to meet men. ""I have to confront it at some point.""Dustin Smith, a 21-year-old from North Dakota, told The Forum that he had chatted with and received sexually explicit photos from Boehning on Grindr. Smith recognized the lawmaker and explained to The Washington Post why he chose to come forward with the exchanges. “I just felt like this story had to get out,” Dustin Smith, 21, told The Washington Post. “A [representative] had voted against a bill for the LGBT community and here he was talking to me on Grindr.”Smith told The Washington Post he confronted the lawmaker before going to the media, asking him, ""Doesn’t the hypocrisy bother you?."" Boehning did not respond. Smith said that nobody influenced him to come forward. Boehning told The Forum that he believes the outing was orchestrated by political opponents, claiming he was told that another House lawmaker would retaliate against him if he did not vote in favor of the anti-discrimination bill on April 2. Boehning voted against the bill, which ultimately failed to pass. He says he voted against this and a past bill attempting to provide legal protection for sexual orientation because he didn't believe his constituents supported them.“This has been a challenge for me,” he told The Forum. “You don’t tell everyone you’re going to vote one way and then switch your vote another way -- you don’t have any credibility that way.” Boehning says he also had concerns about the language of the bill. Boehning's office did not immediately return The Huffington Post's request for comment.Boehning is not the first U.S. lawmaker to be outed on Grindr. In 2011, Puerto Rican Senator Robert Arango, an outspoken enemy of gay marriage and rights, posted shirtless photos of himself on the app and resigned. Pre-smartphone era in 2004, U.S. Rep. Edward L. Schrock from Virginia resigned after he reportedly left voicemail messages on a gay phone sex hotline."

The smaller things also get glossed over: Friday happy hours, Saturday BBQs, birthdays, holiday parties. You get it... we miss out on stuff, and we don't just miss out on stuff that happens back home, we also lose out on the things that happen in our life abroad. A friend this year, who was surprised with a visit from her parents for her 40th birthday, said that this was the first year she spent her birthday with her family in years. My kids, who have celebrated a total of five birthdays, have only celebrated one with family on their actual birthday. It's not easy. Life abroad is awesome, but the sacrifices can definitely be tough.Yesterday was one of those days. It was our son's second birthday. This beautiful, special child turned 2 and there were no grandparents. No aunts, uncles or cousins. And because of my late notice, no friends either. It was just us: mom, dad and sister to celebrate our son's second year of life. Thinking back, it seemed sad to imagine our boy decked out for his birthday with no one around to celebrate him. His party hat on, donning his brightest and whitest birthday boy gear, party horn blowing in disappointment because no one was coming. No grandparents. No aunts, uncles or cousins. And no friends, either. It was just us and that got me remembering a thought I had when we first found out we were moving abroad and having a baby...In the months leading to our move, Husband and I were planning our wedding. I'll skip the gruesome details of wedding planning and leave it at this: A lot of the process sucked and some people let us down, but what we got from it was a deep sense of each other. We were, in the scheme of things to come, now what mattered; just us -- us and the baby that was coming in a few months. We knew we would miss people when we left but we also knew that it would make our bond stronger. We were nervous and unsure about having to start again in an unfamiliar place but excited to start again -- clean slate -- together. Our new family's beginning on a blank piece of paper, creating its own story. We thought about how tight our kids would grow to be, traveling and experiencing the same things together and how exploring the world as a family could certainly bring us closer since nothing - nothing but us - would be constant.

You notice that your shoulders have been creeping up to your ears for the past few hours and your neck is slowly disappearing. Your neck and shoulders feel tense, sore and heavy.Scenario #2You've spent most of the day managing your work and home life from your smartphone. As you look up to take a break, you are struck by how sore your neck feels. It's a sensation that people are calling ""text neck."" You weren't even aware of your body until now and it hurts. Sound Familiar?In both these scenarios, tension and energy are trapped in the neck and shoulders, and your body is screaming for attention. The neck is the pathway between the head and the heart. When the neck is tense and sore, the energy between them is interrupted. When the head and heart aren't communicating there isn't a balance between our thinking life and our feeling life. How can we restore movement, keep the energy flowing, so there is balance and communication? Here are some things you can do to improve your body mechanics and open up the flow of energy between the heart and the head.Improve Your Seated Posture While Working at the ComputerMake sure that you are sitting up and not slouching. In an article published by the Harvard School of Public Health, Dr. Jack Dennerlein, an adjunct professor of ergonomics and safety at the Harvard School of Public Health suggests, ""sitting up straight with your head level, not bent forward, and the top of your monitor positioned just below eye level. Keep your shoulders relaxed and your elbows close to your body. Sit in a chair with good lumbar support. Dr. Dennerlein also suggests placing a pillow against the small of your back if you don't have a special chair. Keep your hands, wrists, forearms, and thighs parallel to the floor."" Being aware of your seated posture not only helps reduce pain, but it also frees up the diaphragm muscle so that breathing is deeper and more relaxed. This alone can change the way you think and feel.Pause Often to Do Some Neck and Shoulder Exercises A daily yoga practice that includes neck and shoulder exercises is extremely helpful in managing symptoms of tension. In addition, bringing these practices into your workday can have added benefit. Even just turning your head from side to side can help relieve discomforts that collect in these target areas at the end of the day. Dr. Ken Hansraj, a spinal and orthopedic surgeon in Poughkeepsie, New York states in this article that ""an adult head weighs 10-12 pounds in a neutral position, but by tilting it forward, the forces it exerts on the neck can surge--up to 60 pounds when the head is tilted by 60 degrees. This can lead to wear and tear in the joints of the neck and possibly surgeries."" Knowing this, we can offset these issues with a daily routine that restores range of motion to the neck and shoulders and allows us to bring more awareness to the way we hold ourselves.Breath from Head to ToeThe breath is a powerful tool for managing stress and releasing tension. While sitting at your computer, let your awareness shift onto your breathing every 15 to 20 minutes. Take several long conscious breaths as you imagine the breath moving from head to toe. Breath and energy work together. When we breathe deeply, it distributes energy to our body and creates a flow that can unblock stagnant patterns that accumulate from lack of movement and poor posture. Just this simple ""top to toe"" breathing can open up the communication and flow between the heart and the head.Shift to Your HeartThe more you can shift your awareness to your heart, the less you will find yourself ""stuck in your head."" Resting your awareness in your heart can be very balancing to the constant influx of external impressions and media. This can relieve that feeling of pressure and tension in the neck and head that occurs when we spend too much time on our devices. It can bring that much needed balance to your body and your life by increasing the flow of energy in the heart. When the neck and shoulders are relaxed, the heart and head can be in harmony creating a sense of balance and well being.How do you take care of your head and neck when you've been sitting at your desk or typing on your smart phone too long?This post was originally published on Ornish Living."

Just like I'm not ashamed to admit that I have asthma.The first time I experienced depression I was in seventh grade. I think it had something to do with the onset of puberty coupled with my entire life changing. After seven years as a stay-at-home-parent, my mom went back to work full-time and I was suddenly responsible for caring for my 6-year-old brother after school until my parents got home from work. I started junior high this year and didn't cope well with changes in friendship and harder classes.The way I dealt with it, because I had no idea why I felt so sad all the time, was to stop eating. It wasn't a conscious decision on my part. The stress and anxiety of my life made me lose my appetite. I remember going through the lunch line at school and getting my tray and turning right around and throwing everything on it away. After a while, one of the lunch ladies caught on and scolded me. So I learned it was best to take my tray, sit down, mess with the food but not eat anything, and then discard it. After seventh grade I asked my mom not to buy school lunch anymore.I don't want to make it sound like I had an eating disorder because I didn't (if you're struggling with an eating disorder, call the National Eating Disorder Association hotline at 1-800-931-2237). Not eating was a coping mechanism I unconsciously used when the stress and anxiety was overwhelming, and it wasn't overwhelming all the time.Sometimes when the depression got really bad in junior high, I would come straight home from school and change into my pajamas. My dad caught on and he said something to me at dinner time about being in my pajamas several days in a row way before bedtime. I learned it was better not to change into my pajamas until bed time. People who are depressed like to hide their problematic behaviors because they are so ashamed of the way they feel. I was very ashamed and yet I didn't have the words or life experience to voice what I was going through.For most of junior high and high school I didn't know that what I had was called depression. And that's not to say I was depressed all the time. I was able to function and get good grades. I just had a few overwhelming bouts off and on and when it got bad I would stop eating and wear my pajamas every chance I could get. I also couch-potatoed with reruns of The Real World (this was back in the '90s when the show was good).That hardest part about dealing with depression as an adolescent, for me, was that no one seemed to notice. Research has shown that depression can stem from genetics, and I watched both of my parents struggle with depression. I think both of them were too depressed to notice that I was also depressed. There were many nights I had to make dinner for the family, make sure my brother did his homework and practice the piano, and put myself to bed. I don't blame my parents... I think they did the best they could with what skills and knowledge they had at the time. I know what it's like to barely have the energy to get through the day that any additional problem seems insurmountable.I struggled with bouts of depression until I was 20 years old. That is when my fiance (now husband) and caring roommates interceded and got me help. I learned that a lot of my depression stemmed from a hormonal imbalance because it often got worse when my hormones were at their lowest levels during my menses. Since that time I've either been on birth control or pregnant and my depression abated for a very long time.For 15 years I was depression free. Even when I lost my mom to cancer I can't say I was depressed because I didn't experience the same symptoms. Yes, I was unbelievably sad and grieving. But grief is not depression and I sought ways to cope with my grief so that I didn't become depressed. I attended a grief support group, went to a few counseling sessions, and let myself feel every sad emotion I had when I had it. It's actually very emotionally healthy to let yourself feel sadness instead of repressing it.What I didn't know was my depression was lying in wait ready to take over my brain chemistry at any time I was not vigilant. In September 2013 my husband, along with 30 percent of his company, was laid off. He was out of work for four months, which in retrospect doesn't seem like very long, but at the time it was the longest four months of my life. I was in a constant state of panic wondering if we were going to lose our house and end up living in a van down by the river. Not that we could have even afforded a van. We depleted our savings and racked up some credit card debt, but with the unfailing support of family members and friends we pulled through. And we were treated to some of the most humbling displays of generosity and love our family has ever seen. We survived it and now he has a great job and we're in a much better place.But...It was after my husband went back to work that the depression hit. I was in full-on survival mode for four months and I didn't allow myself to process what I was going through, which I think is fairly typical. I couldn't understand why getting out of bed and taking care of my children was harder than ever when I no longer had the threat of a van and a river hanging over my head. It wasn't until a good friend interceded, who could tell what I was going through, that I finally admitted that after 15 years of keeping my depression at bay, it was back. Thanks to her I started taking a supplement that improves the serotonin levels in your brain and now I finally feel like I'm back to my regular self.What is absolutely infuriating about depression is other people's perception of it. I hate it when people tell me when I'm depressed to just think happy, positive thoughts. Having depression is not the same as having a bad day and a picture of a fluffy kitten will NOT lift my spirits. Depression is more than being sad. Or when people tell me I need to forget about myself and serve others and that will cure my depression. I hate to break it to people, but most people with depression are able to function in life and they are serving others and the joy from serving others doesn't fix chemical imbalances in your brain.So let me tell you what depression is like for me. It is debilitating. It makes mundane, ordinary tasks like taking a shower or making the bed seem impossible. It is soul-sucking. It breaks you down into a person who no longer feels anything but apathy. It also makes you feel completely worthless and unlovable. When I'm in the throes of depression my brain lies to me and tells me that I am worth nothing. No one cares about me. The world would be a better place if I died. And when you have all this negative self-talk running through your head all day long, no amount of fluffy kitten pictures is going to take that away. No amount of weeding your neighbor's garden is going to take all that negative self-talk away. If anything, you just tell yourself how worthless you are because you could have weeded that garden better and/or faster. Another thing that happens to me when I'm depressed is I isolate myself from others. The internet and Facebook has made it super easy for me to be social without ever having to leave the house, and well, never leaving the house when you are physically capable of it is not healthy. Every human being needs real-life human contact and SUNLIGHT!So what do you do when you suspect a friend is depressed? I would say the best thing you can do is reach out. One of the first lies our brains tell us is that no one, absolutely no one, cares about us. You reaching out and expressing concern proves our depressed brains wrong. Once you've expressed your concern, don't offer them dumb platitudes (""the sun will come out tomorrow""), don't try to minimize what they're going through (""some people have it way worse than you""), just listen, listen, LISTEN! If they express their negative self-talk to you (I'm worthless and no one loves me) validate that what they are is experiencing is real but what they're telling themselves is not true (""If you were worthless and no one loves you, why would I be here reaching out worried about you?"").I think I'm pretty lucky that my friend reached out when she did. I was in a swirling vortex of despair and didn't even realize it. Most of the time I can recognize when my depression is coming on and combat it with exercise, going outside for a walk, talking to a friend, reaching out to my husband and letting him know what's going on, or watching a really funny movie and laughing my guts out. Once I'm in a full-on depression those things don't work anymore, so it's best to head depression off at the pass. Like when I start to feel like my asthma is acting up, I start using my rescue inhaler more and resting.To those who are currently clinically depressed I would ask that you reach out -- to a friend, neighbor, family member, spouse... anyone you trust. Sometimes medication helps, sometimes it doesn't. I just want you to know that you're not alone. You're not worthless. And there are people who love you deeply.This post originally appeared on Iron Daisy.____________________________________ Need help?

A line of police behind riot shields hurled smoke grenades and fired pepper balls at dozens of protesters to enforce a citywide curfew. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0b152200003501dadaf9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week, I keep the communities and families of Nepal and Baltimore in prayerful consideration. While the nation-state of Nepal and the city of Baltimore are thousands of miles apart, and their respective tragedies seem completely unrelated, there is a connection between the two, in my mind's eye. Earthquakes (and typhoons, and hurricanes, and disease outbreaks) occurring in resource-challenged, poverty-laden communities have a disproportionately pervasive impact on the population. Infrastructure is weak or lacking. Housing and buildings are less well constructed. Medical, public health and emergency response capacities are often thin and compromised even before the onset of the disaster. This is why the death toll in a developing nation affected by such disasters is often unconscionably high -- well into the thousands, compared to similar events in more developed nations.The city of Baltimore -- as in Ferguson, Missouri before it -- while not physically devastated by an earthquake, is indeed experiencing shocking tremors of its civic psyche. Too many African-American communities like Ferguson and Baltimore suffer from a chronic lack of opportunity and hope, in combination with the visceral frustration of racism, marginalization, stigmatization and oppression. A Freddie Gray incident, then, triggers a shift in an already fragile fault line, and an earthquake of community protest and violence erupts. While it certainly can be argued that violence in any form is ""senseless,"" the violence of Ferguson and Baltimore ""makes sense"" to me, because I can understand its roots -- even while, at the very same time, repudiating it. By comparison, the school shootings at Sandy Hook and Columbine make no sense to me whatsoever. Webster's Dictionary defines the term ""resiliency"" as: the ability to recover rapidly, as from misfortune; buoyancy. Communities, families and people can indeed be built to possess greater resiliency -- and not only weather misfortune and tragedy -- but coalesce, thrive and strengthen as a result. In a bumper sticker analogy, this is what ""Boston Strong"" was about in the wake of the horrific Boston Marathon bombings: We are resilient. We have strength. We have assets. We will endure, and we will emerge stronger on the other side of this.But resiliency requires a basic level of hope, of promise, of optimism, of something to believe in. Undoubtedly there are community and civic leaders in Baltimore who will prove their measure of resiliency, and are already plotting and acting on how to infuse hope and optimism into a future for disaffected and disengaged young people. This week, from Baltimore, our television screens are filled with images of rock throwers, burning vehicles, broken glass and black males in handcuffs. The work of resiliency-building and trust-building will unfold largely out of the view of news cameras, quietly, earnestly, purposefully. Like Nepal, the cameras will disappear once the rubble settles in, and the quietly heroic work of rebuilding unfolds.The work of resiliency, and optimism, and hope and promise occurs in the ""in-between"": between the tragic moment of police shootings and civic and civil unrest. How do we learn and grow from Ferguson and Baltimore, listening better, engaging more intently, building trust, strengthening accountability? Are we learning anything? For all of the criticism heaped on police departments and local law enforcement -- and some of it deservedly so -- the matter of race and hopelessness goes well beyond professionals who wear the badge and blue uniform.I wonder, sometimes, if we have lost our eyes on the prize. While there is much to be said for greater dignity and professionalism in the behavior of local law enforcement, I cannot ascribe to the notion that, as it relates to the crisis of young men of color, the best we should hope for is for police officers to more humanely and professionally handcuff and detain our black young men once they have been arrested. The real prize is to instill a culture of meaningful hope and optimism in these young people, such that the reason for a police encounter is reduced or averted in the first place.This is why, at both a personal and professional level, I am committed to the work of boys and young men of color, as embodied by President Obama's My Brother's Keeper.

UNMIL Photo / Staton Winter On April 2, the United Nations Security Council resolved to resume the phased withdrawal of the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). The decision highlights the Council's confidence in Liberia both to continue the remarkable job it has done in rolling back Ebola, and to build on the progress made since the deployment of the peacekeeping mission at the end of the civil war in 2003. In March, the Liberian government approved a detailed security transition plan that will enable the country to assume full responsibility for all facets of its security by 30 June 2016, the deadline set by the Security Council. Prepared in close consultation with UNMIL and other stakeholders, the plan sets clear benchmarks for Liberian authorities to take over all security responsibilities still performed by UNMIL -- such as providing a presidential guard and safely disposing of unexploded ordnance from the war. The plan is closely linked with UNMIL's own drawdown, but it is less about replacing the UNMIL presence and more about addressing the challenges of maintaining security, peace and access to justice in post-war Liberia. For the security transition plan to succeed, the Government must consistently prioritize security sector and rule-of-law reforms throughout the 14 months remaining until the handover deadline. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is fully committed to the transition, and made sure that justice and security issues were included in the nation's post-Ebola recovery plan. The security challenges triggered by the epidemic in July and August last year were indeed immense, ranging from responding to social unrest and enforcing curfews and checkpoints, to cases of Ebola among Liberia's uniformed ranks and the risk that Ebola would enter its overcrowded prisons. The virus, which killed more than 3,000 Liberians in 2014, quickly overwhelmed the healthcare system and triggered profound adverse economic, social, political and security reverberations. The Security Council recognized the unprecedented extent of the Ebola outbreak in Africa as a threat to international peace and security. Community support is vital to the security transition plan. The horrors of Ebola exposed the lack of progress in bringing effective services to most Liberians. A silver lining of the Ebola crisis, however, was the initiative communities took in beating back the virus. While Ebola may initially have reinforced communities' mistrust of outsiders and the Government, over time the crisis helped to develop cooperation within and among communities as collective effort was required, including to locate and isolate those possibly exposed to Ebola across large areas. With strong support from international partners, the Government stepped up its response. A recent study verified that the authorities became a credible source of Ebola information. After communities accepted that Ebola was real, people became attentive to the life-saving messages on prevention disseminated across the country by UNMIL Radio, community radio stations and other forms of outreach.A successful security paradigm after the UNMIL drawdown requires at least the same degree of community involvement, consultation and cooperation that resulted in Liberia bringing Ebola to the brink of elimination. It is essential that more justice and corrections personnel be deployed outside of the capital, Monrovia. But numbers aren't the whole story: the police and judiciary can be effective only if they earn and enjoy the trust and cooperation of communities. The story of a Liberian police officer who earned the respect of the community he serves. UNMILTVThroughout the transition, UNMIL and its partners will continue to play their part by supporting the Government to strengthen its security capacities and move forward critical processes fundamental to long-term peace and stability, including security sector reform and, critically, national reconciliation.Ahead of the next UNMIL military departures in May and June, UNMIL personnel will join Government-led town hall meetings across Liberia to address the concerns of the public, and convey the message that communities themselves need to do their part to maintain public order, as they have also done in the past. Liberia National Police and UN Peacekeepers spread the news about about UN withdrawal in Sinje, Grand Cape Mount County. UNMIL Photo / Staton WinterPeace has prevailed in Liberia since 2003, through the draw down of peacekeepers from 15,000 in the aftermath of the civil war. By the end of September 2015, the number of military personnel in UNMIL will be 3,590, in addition to just over 1,500 UN police.UNMIL's transition is more complex than pulling out and handing back specific security tasks, and I regularly ask Liberians to reflect on outstanding issues that they would want to see addressed while peacekeepers remain in their country. It is incumbent on Liberia's leaders and people to use the remaining presence of peacekeepers to address, as far as possible, the root causes of Liberia's fragility."

More sea turtle lovers equal more ocean advocates -- a virtuous, positive feedback loop.",2015-04-29,"A student helps to release a baby turtle to the ocean in Bali, Indonesia, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2014. More than a thousand baby turtles were released during a campaign to save sea turtles. (AP Photo/Firdia Lisnawati)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb169172200004301db4d87.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Can you recall a time that you glimpsed a sea turtle swimming away from you under water? Or you witnessed the multimillion-year-old ritual of a nesting turtle burying 100 glistening white eggs under the sand and moon? Or the first time you carefully placed a baby sea turtle, hatched minutes prior, on the sand and watched it duck-dive wave after wave as it pushed its way seaward to begin an uncertain decades-long journey?Of course you can. It's moments like those that led you to the curiosity and exploration you're having now as you read. Those experiences transformed us, made us into the turtle warriors we are. Face it, how many of your high school friends are reading about global sea turtle population trends right now? None, that's how many. So, how did that feeling of awe convert into what may be best described as a life dedicated to turtle-centric altruism?A typical, oft-repeated and unquestioned adage is: ""If you can't measure it, you can't manage it."" Those of us who do environmental management, who have been involved with successful conservation work and movement building, know that statement is BS. The most important things we manage are not (easily) measurable -- from the quality of our new team members to the awe and wonder that's at the root of why we care in the first place. Our greatest successes sometimes occur: (a) In spite of government agencies' denials of decades of well-considered science, (b) In the face of barely quantified threats, or (c) Alongside massive holes in our understanding of basic sea turtle biology and life history.The ""measure to manage"" dogma found its place as militaristic styles expanded into business, and business expanded into our professional relationship with nature in the post-World War II industrial era. The language of targets, tactics, strategies and enemies now pervades agency- and NGO-speak alike. But, when the value of sea turtles to humans is reduced to what's easily measured with our standard metrics and sorely limited resources, we run the risk of getting things dangerously wrong.Ecology and economics provide a clean, clear, yet wildly incomplete, even cartoon-like framework for analyzing the values of nature. Consider this familiar balance sheet. In one column (A) is the commodified value of sea turtles as resource: eggs, meat, shell, oil. In the next, (B) is the value of sea turtles as eco-tourist attractions: hotel rooms, park fees, guides, meals, travel. If the number at the bottom of column B exceeds the value of column A, sea turtles get to live (in theory, at least). The conversation has been expanded in recent years to include a third column called ""ecosystem services"" that provide public benefits. Those benefits include dune stabilization, sea grass maintenance and even climate regulation, as provided by the trophic cascades, at the top of which are often found sea turtles and other predators.Fortunately, the conversation around valuing nature is expanding quickly to include the cognitive, emotional, psychological and social benefits that we know are real drivers of the human nature relationship. When neuropsychologists and conservation biologists team up, the results can be revolutionary. Consider a few of the real but rarely described benefits of working with sea turtles.Awe and WonderNew research suggests that the feeling of awe is good for our health, boosts empathy and compassion, and helps connect us to the people and places around us.Feelings of awe are some of the most cherished and transformative experiences in human life and are generated by art, music, architecture, but most often nature. Dr. Paul Piff of the School of Sociology at University of California Irvine defines awe as ""the sense of being in the presence of something bigger than oneself that current knowledge structures cannot accommodate and that allows people to rise above stimulus-response patterns and lose themselves in an all-encompassing event.""Scientists have made evolutionary arguments for the universality of awe and how it has likely evolved. Other studies find that awe may enhance our memory of events, play an important role in morality, make people less self-focused and more prosocial, lead to enhanced generosity, increase virtuous behavior, reduce feelings of entitlement and increase helping. Current studies show that feelings associated with awe can reduce cytokines (proteins important for cell signaling), chemicals associated with disease and even inflammation.Yet, some people live wonder-free lives. For those who work with sea turtles, awe can be a daily experience. When we share our work, we make the world better. More sea turtle lovers equal more ocean advocates -- a virtuous, positive feedback loop.Solitude and PrivacyOur lives are becoming more and more connected, and time spent truly alone with ourselves and our own thoughts is sadly minimized. A recent study in Science demonstrates how uncomfortable solitude feels to college students: two-thirds of men pressed a button to deliver a painful jolt after a mere 15-minute period of solitude. One man -- considered an outlier -- found quiet thinking to be so disagreeable that he opted for a shock 190 times. In these modern times, our written and spoken words, as well as our physical movements, are almost constantly monitored by strangers, government agencies and marketers. And this loss of solitude and privacy adds to the stress of life.Being near, in, on or under water can be a refuge or escape, and that relationship can have the same positive benefits mentioned earlier for awe and wonder. A beach or a bay can provide a rare retreat from technology. And those are the settings in which work frequently places us fortunate souls who are turtle professionals.Creativity and InspirationArtists and engineers, musicians and entrepreneurs, writers and scientists rely heavily on their ability to generate creativity -- combine old ideas and pieces to make new ones -- to think of things that have never been thought of. It's no surprise that great thinkers such as Sir Isaac Newton, Oliver Sacks and Albert Einstein found inspiration outside under a blue sky or beside flowing waters. Free from walls and over- stimulation of modern, urban existence, our brains work differently. That's not to say better, but there's a certain kind of expansive thinking that's facilitated by blue space.Perhaps there's no better place to experience awe, creativity, inspiration, privacy, solitude and wonder than on a sea turtle beach. Humans have depicted their appreciation for the ocean and sea turtles through art for millennia. You've had much the same experience as our ancestors on the beach at night, face to face with our beloved chelonians. As a conservation or research professional, student, seasonal volunteer or wayfaring traveler, being with sea turtles in nature changes us. We become better versions of ourselves.These are big ideas that are tricky to assign numbers to, but important to put into words, with ever-increasing clarity and rigor. Quite literally -- as well as poetically -- being with sea turtles is good medicine. And here's a prediction: In the not-so-distant future, medical professionals will prescribe two weeks of volunteering on a turtle beach for what ails their patients.This essay first appeared in the annual State of the World's Sea Turtles report. Dr Nichols writes more about the cognitive, emotional,, psychological and social benefits of healthy, wild nature in his New York Times bestseller Blue Mind."
15,CRIME,Killing Tsarnaev Part Two: 'Friends' of Jahar Rally to Save His Life,"Phillip Martin, ContributorSr. Investigative Reporter WGBH Radio Boston; Sr. Fellow Schus...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/killing-tsarnaev-part-two_b_7164454.html,"On some social media pages a parallel world exists, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is viewed as innocent, not guilty; A parallel world where Tsarnaev has achieved near rock star fame",2015-04-29,2015-04-29-1430277284-6334217-FOTScreenShot20130426at11.51.14AM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-29-1430277284-6334217-FOTScreenShot20130426at11.51.14AM-thumb.png,"On the first day of testimony in the penalty phase of the Marathon Bombing trial, prosecutors portrayed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as ""America's worst nightmare."" Krystle Campbell's father, William Jr., barely held back tears describing his now dead daughter as ""the light of my life.""But on some social media pages a parallel world exists, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is viewed as innocent, not guilty; A parallel world where Tsarnaev has achieved near rock star fame among some; a world where much of the evidence in this trial has been contrived and made up. There are disagreements for sure, but widely differing groups have united in a largely on-line effort to stop the possible execution of the 21-year old convicted murderer. It is not clear how many informally ""Friends of Tsarnaev"" we are talking about, but it is a very small group for sure. Some are fellow Chechens or Russians. Elena Teyer, a Russian immigrant living in Savannah, Georgia, proudly and loudly supports Tsarnaev. In December, she disrupted a pre-trail hearing in U.S. District Court in South Boston when she shouted encouragement to the defendant in Russian. She later translated for reporters what she said:   ""I said in court, 'Jahar, you have a lot of supporters. We pray for you. We're here for you Jahar. We know you're innocent."" Elena Teyer introduces herself as the mother in-law of Ibragim Todashev, a Chechen man who was shot to death in Orlando, Florida, in May 2013, by an FBI agent who was allegedly questioning him about a triple murder in Waltham, Massachusetts, in which his friend Tamerlan Tsarnaev was also allegedly implicated. With Todashev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev dead, Teyer says her main mission now is to keep ""Jahar"" alive, using his familiar street name. But Teyer claims she is being harassed. Teyer, a former U.S. Army soldier, does not consider herself to be a security threat, but the FBI does, she says. She says following the Marathon bombing and the killing of Todashev, she was visited on her job at the Fort Stewart Army base in Georgia by federal agents.""They came to my commander and said 'Teyer she's now under official investigation because she's a threat to the FBI because she's going to buy a gun and kill FBI agent and his family'. This is ridiculous I would think. If people saying stuff like this they out of their mind."" Teyer, whose Army service record lists an honorable discharge, says she doesn't even own a gun. ""I want justice. Me personally I do everything the legal way."" Fatima Tlisova, an investigative reporter for the Voice of America Russian Service, has interviewed Elena Teyer. ""I met her three or four times."" Tlisova has also met with other so-called friends of Tsarnaev several times since 2013.""In common the friends of Tsarnaev have one thing. Most of them believe in conspiracy theories. And people who believe, truly believe in conspiracy theories -- they think they are victims. So, that is not unusual for these type of people."" But paranoia, says Tlisova, doesn't mean Teyer's fears are irrational. Though Teyer is not Chechen, her slain son-in-law was. And that is significant, says Tlisova. ""The first year after the bombings in Boston I was getting an enormous number of messages from all over the United States from the Chechens who've told me that they've been harassed by the FBI. They've been visited frequently, interrogated."" And among them, says Tlisova, are some who have come to view Tsarneav sympathetically or empathetically.Another group of Tsarnaev supporters have banded together via social media, mainly Facebook, under the banner ""Free Jahar"", and not all of them believe in conspiracy theories.""There are several circles, and I steer clear of the conspiracy theories--there's fake blood and actors, etcetera. I do not condone that at all."" Paula makes a point of saying that she is also not a so-called Jahar Fan Girl.What Paula does believe is that Tsarnaev did not receive a fair trial ""And there's a lot of action going on throughout the Internet with people questioning the fairness of the trial."" Distrust of the U.S. is why Paula asked WGBH not to reveal her last name. ""People do not generally here in Toronto, and people around the world, do not trust the U.S. Government."" She belongs to a Facebook group that claims 14,377 members. But Paula, a legal staffer living in Toronto, Canada, insist they are not monolithic in their views. Some Friends of Tsarnaev are religious. Many are not. Most believe that he is innocent, despite Tsarnaev's conviction and his admission of guilt through his attorney. Sara Ali, a Jahar supporter in Detroit, steered me to a YouTube video that she said the Marathon Bombing jury did not see, which suggest that the Tsarnaev brothers had been set up. But the video does not seem to demonstrate that at all. Some Tsarnaev supporters believe he is guilty, but influenced by his brother, just as the defense team argues. The so-called friends of Tsarnaev are united in their opposition to U.S. prosecutors' legal efforts to have Jahar -- as they call him -- executed. Paula in Toronto said: ""They're the ones that have gone after the penalty and have selected a death-qualified jury. And if you look at it from their perspective the government has gone and got the gun and they're using the jury to pull the trigger."" Sasha, another Tsarnaev supporter, lives in London. ""Well I think even before you can even think about the death penalty in this case you need to go back to basics and grant him a fair trial. I think he should get a new trial maybe outside of Boston. And because there are so many questions that were raised during this trial more than there were questions that were answered."" And for Sasha the questions include, why did Eric Holder's Justice Department insist in pursuing the death penalty? ""Well I feel internationally that people will be against the death penalty for Mr. Tsarnaev given that 90 percent of the countries in the world have banished executions. It's such an outdated method that should have no place in modern society and it's extremely barbaric."" And Tsarnaev's execution would stir universal anger, says Paula in Toronto:""Security concerns are huge and massive. This case is being watched by everybody around the world.""Yet, Tsarnaev supporters have been conspicuous by their absence at the U.S. courthouse in South Boston. Elena Teyer's in-court outburst in December ironically prompted the defense to file a motion to keep Tsarnaev supporters away from the courthouse. Judge George O'Toole ultimately permitted demonstrations. Yet, the so-called Friends of Tsarnaev have not been seen during the trial. Elena Teyer, speaking in heavy Russian-accented English from her home in Savannah, Georgia, says that is because she and others have been banned from the premises, and she fears showing up""Exactly, even our supporters who were at the court to protest. They've been followed with FBI. FBI came to their houses, to their families, all of them. Everybody's scared to death now.""But U.S. Court officials told WGBH that neither Teyer nor other self-proclaimed friends of the defendant are barred from the U.S. courthouse in Boston. The FBI told WGBH that it will not comment on this matter while the Tsarnaev trial is in progress. Those in front of the U.S. Courthouse who are actively protesting the prospect of imposition of the death penalty for the 21-year old Chechen are decidedly not friends of Tsarnaev. They also do not regard themselves as ""anti-Tsarnaev"" they said. Braydon Shanley was standing outside the court with other religiously-inspired demonstrators on a frigid Spring day holding a sign reading ""Blessed Are the Merciful"". He said he is spurred by Christian beliefs and neither pro nor anti-Tsarnaev sentiments.Braydon Shanley and others protesting death penalty for Tsarnaev""The implication of being pro-Tsarnaev is that you're anti-victim. And we're not anti-victim. I think that compassion naturally goes to the innocent victim. These are innocent victims. It's like bombing a wedding. So, it's not that we're insensitive to the victim. It's that we're trying to get compassion for the victimizer because all life is sacred."" In this way, Christian protesters, a former U.S. soldier from Russia under the watchful eye of the FBI, and young worldwide Facebook friends have formed an unlikely alliance to keep alive a man whose own lawyers declared guilty of the heinous crimes for which he was convicted. But whose continued life -- like a Rorschach test -- seems to mean many different things for different many people.Killing Tsarnaev Part One: Experts Warn of the Cost of Martyrdom"

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0ac93c000032000b5e2d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If this was an episode of The Wire, the critically acclaimed TV show about the inequalities of Baltimore, which many celebrated because it was ""so real,"" there would be think pieces, empathy, and Peabody awards; but when a real life powder keg of injustice becomes exposed as anything but fiction following the death of Freddie Gray, we continue the persecution and snap the cultural spinal cord of an entire community with the weight of judgment and ignorance, and discredit the serious national problems of police brutality, and social and economic inequality. In case you missed it, click here for a recap... of the current state of Baltimore, not The Wire.These are complicated issues and if you think looting is horrific and focus on the misguided opportunists over the focused majority of peaceful protestors, you may be ignoring the horrific fact that some cops are in fact out in these streets killing black men and women and getting away with what many feel is government sanctioned murder in our own country. If that doesn't also make you enraged and upset, don't tell me how angry you are about elements of a peaceful protest that devolved into riots and looting while you sit at home watching the fiction being crafted by major broadcast news networks (Fox News isn't the only guilty party at this point...I'm talking to you and your employer, Don Lemon). It's all displayed rather simply here by Baltimore City Councilman Nick Mosby. In this on-the-fly interview with a Fox News reporter, Mosby denounces both the riots and the underlying cause of the unrest that people are protesting as the reporter attempts to redirect the discussion to the looting that was just discouraged. See what they did there?""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."" - President John F. KennedyDon't despairingly tell us, ""But this is America,"" when you don't say the same about the absurdity of American inequity as well. How many people have to die, how many desperate marginalized communities have to resort to these demonstrations before you realize that the machinations of racism and inequality are very much alive and shaping the flaccid misinformed response to how things have unfolded in Baltimore, Ferguson, Florida, the Bronx and too many other areas over the last few years? It all stems from historic inequalities that our country was built upon, which we can no longer ignore and must now correct with protest, policy, and pointed productive solutions. To be honest, it's more than needing mothers out in the street slapping sense into their children, which is commended, yet the viral way it is shared via news sources serves as a subverted way of perpetuating the stereotype that the only way we can tame our black children is by redirecting brutality back onto them to exert control, as if that too is acceptable. It is not.Look, if you can follow a complicated episode of Game of Thrones, then you can follow this narrative playing out in Baltimore. What makes it worse is that we've seen it all before. This episode is a rerun, and we're binge watching it over and over again without change and it must stop. Like the people of the communities damaged, it's time for all of us to clean up. Investments in education, infrastructure, support, and job opportunities, as well as civic engagement are important changes needed in areas like these, way before the response to call in the National Guard. We must act and empower our communities locally and nationally, before we open our doors to find out firsthand how a community can turn to this. What role will you play in the next episode?"

In Congo, a country where women have been deliberately silenced, where they have little or no land rights, where education is not an expectation and it is reported that 2.5 million girls are out of school, these women are speaking up. They're learning to sew, a trade that is already earning them income to send their girls to school, to feed and clothe their kids, to save money for the future. It was Action Kivu's Sewing Workshop graduation day for 60 girls and women in a village in eastern Congo, a day made possible by pajamas, you, and Robin Wright! Celebrating, the women held high their graduation certificates, sang songs of gratitude, and made plans for their new small business ventures as designers and seamstresses. Watch the video from the graduation day to hear their voices, to listen to the women share their own stories in their own words!Robin Wright, ""Mama Robin,"" as many of the Congolese women who met Wright on her 2011 trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo call the actor, is a vocal activist on behalf of the people of Congo. Late last year, Robin partnered with her friend and fashion designer Karen Fowler to create a campaign for the women of Congo through Pour Les Femmes, a luxury pajama company. Robin Wright watched the above video of the graduates celebrating and sharing their stories, and sent this message to the women. ""Congratulations to the graduates of Action Kivu! This is only the beginning... You are setting the example and reminding all of us that self-reliance is the key to a sustainable and rewarding life. Bravo!!!""  - Robin WrightThe profits from the PJ sales traveled 15,114 kilometers from Los Angeles to Congo, and purchased sewing kits for these women to start their own businesses, earning income to feed, clothe, and send their kids to school, helping to break the cycle of poverty and change the landscape of their lives.Some women walked one kilometer, some trekked five or six, a few bused in from the city of Bukavu, braving the unpaved dirt roads made muddy and dangerous from two days of the non-stop, rainy season wet weather. It's just this wet weather that makes travel in Congo so dangerous, yet also makes it look a lush, verdant paradise, with its rolling green fields and the wide leaves of banana trees leading up to the misty mountains surrounding the valley. But the potential for paradise in Congo has long been marred by conflict, extreme poverty, and violence against women as a weapon of war. Amani Matabaro is the man and the inspiration behind Action Kivu. In 2006, Amani and his wife created Action Kivu's partner organization in eastern Congo, Actions pour le Bien être de la Femme et de l'Enfant au Kivu (ABFEK), after learning that his cousins, victims of the ongoing conflict, needed work and a place to live. At the March 2015 graduation, Amani congratulated each seamstress for her diligence in learning a new skill and gaining an education, invoking empowerment that no one could take away from them. Often overwhelmed by tears of joy, Amani handed each woman her certificate of completion, and draped her new tape measure around her bowed head, a sort of sewing stole denoting achievement in education. Each woman received her graduation kit: a push-pedal sewing machine (for working in villages with little or no electricity), fabric, a box of threads, scissors, and her tape measure. The rain abated, and the women stepped outside to pose for photos and share their stories of how learning to sew and having the means to earn income has already changed their lives.""I am the happiest person on the planet today because of this graduation kit, I had never expected this, I waited for a long time but today is the day,"" said Cibalonza Claudine, the sewing program's star student, who was wearing a dress she had made. Cibalonza walks an hour and a half each way to attend the sewing classes at the Center, and was never late, never missed a session, said Amani.Action Kivu's work in Congo provides women with a variety of entrepreneurial programs to create sustainable change in their community, from bread baking and basket making to the sewing workshops, from literacy classes to a demonstration farm for growing food to sell and eat, as well as education assistance for the kids in the community whose families cannot afford to send them to school. Your partnership through Action Kivu, whether an annual gift or a monthly donation, changes lives. ""Before I came to this center, I was nothing, I meant nothing at all,"" Cibalonza said at the graduation ceremony. ""After learning the sewing skills, I started rebuilding my life and today, I AM SOMEBODY. No matter the rain I will carry my sewing machine and show my mom and my child that I have to start a new life. My plan is to open a new business and I promise I will prosper -- thank you ABFEK, thank you Action Kivu, thank you Robin Wright, God bless you all and keep you strong for changing my life."""

They're learning to sew, a trade that is already earning them income to send their girls to school, to feed and clothe their kids, to save money for the future. It was Action Kivu's Sewing Workshop graduation day for 60 girls and women in a village in eastern Congo, a day made possible by pajamas, you, and Robin Wright! Celebrating, the women held high their graduation certificates, sang songs of gratitude, and made plans for their new small business ventures as designers and seamstresses. Watch the video from the graduation day to hear their voices, to listen to the women share their own stories in their own words!Robin Wright, ""Mama Robin,"" as many of the Congolese women who met Wright on her 2011 trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo call the actor, is a vocal activist on behalf of the people of Congo. Late last year, Robin partnered with her friend and fashion designer Karen Fowler to create a campaign for the women of Congo through Pour Les Femmes, a luxury pajama company. Robin Wright watched the above video of the graduates celebrating and sharing their stories, and sent this message to the women. ""Congratulations to the graduates of Action Kivu! This is only the beginning... You are setting the example and reminding all of us that self-reliance is the key to a sustainable and rewarding life. Bravo!!!""  - Robin WrightThe profits from the PJ sales traveled 15,114 kilometers from Los Angeles to Congo, and purchased sewing kits for these women to start their own businesses, earning income to feed, clothe, and send their kids to school, helping to break the cycle of poverty and change the landscape of their lives.Some women walked one kilometer, some trekked five or six, a few bused in from the city of Bukavu, braving the unpaved dirt roads made muddy and dangerous from two days of the non-stop, rainy season wet weather. It's just this wet weather that makes travel in Congo so dangerous, yet also makes it look a lush, verdant paradise, with its rolling green fields and the wide leaves of banana trees leading up to the misty mountains surrounding the valley. But the potential for paradise in Congo has long been marred by conflict, extreme poverty, and violence against women as a weapon of war. Amani Matabaro is the man and the inspiration behind Action Kivu. In 2006, Amani and his wife created Action Kivu's partner organization in eastern Congo, Actions pour le Bien être de la Femme et de l'Enfant au Kivu (ABFEK), after learning that his cousins, victims of the ongoing conflict, needed work and a place to live. At the March 2015 graduation, Amani congratulated each seamstress for her diligence in learning a new skill and gaining an education, invoking empowerment that no one could take away from them. Often overwhelmed by tears of joy, Amani handed each woman her certificate of completion, and draped her new tape measure around her bowed head, a sort of sewing stole denoting achievement in education. Each woman received her graduation kit: a push-pedal sewing machine (for working in villages with little or no electricity), fabric, a box of threads, scissors, and her tape measure. The rain abated, and the women stepped outside to pose for photos and share their stories of how learning to sew and having the means to earn income has already changed their lives.""I am the happiest person on the planet today because of this graduation kit, I had never expected this, I waited for a long time but today is the day,"" said Cibalonza Claudine, the sewing program's star student, who was wearing a dress she had made. Cibalonza walks an hour and a half each way to attend the sewing classes at the Center, and was never late, never missed a session, said Amani.Action Kivu's work in Congo provides women with a variety of entrepreneurial programs to create sustainable change in their community, from bread baking and basket making to the sewing workshops, from literacy classes to a demonstration farm for growing food to sell and eat, as well as education assistance for the kids in the community whose families cannot afford to send them to school. Your partnership through Action Kivu, whether an annual gift or a monthly donation, changes lives. ""Before I came to this center, I was nothing, I meant nothing at all,"" Cibalonza said at the graduation ceremony. ""After learning the sewing skills, I started rebuilding my life and today, I AM SOMEBODY. No matter the rain I will carry my sewing machine and show my mom and my child that I have to start a new life. My plan is to open a new business and I promise I will prosper -- thank you ABFEK, thank you Action Kivu, thank you Robin Wright, God bless you all and keep you strong for changing my life."""

Another Michigan State student, Kevin Lange, filmed the end of the interaction, including the crucial punch, and uploaded the 10-second video to YouTube. It's unclear from the video, which has already been viewed nearly 50,000 times, what led to the punch. It opens with three men, two of them McDonald's employees, talking near a restaurant door with a fourth man, who is mostly obscured. A few seconds later, this heretofore unseen fourth man starts to run -- and one of the two McDonald's employees slams him with one swift punch. He falls down, and several other people in the restaurant shout in surprise. Lange said the apparently drunken student was punched after stumbling into the restaurant, spitting on the counter and throwing a ""Caution: Wet Floor"" sign. Police said the man who was punched sustained injuries that were not life-threatening. According to student paper, The State News, he is filing a criminal complaint against the restaurant employee who punched him.

""I saw people break out into tears of joy,” O’Farrill told The Huffington Post. “And I think that moment made its way on to the tracks.”The New York-raised son of legendary Cuban bandleader Chico O'Farrill has long looked to the island for inspiration. He first visited in 2002 at the invitation of Cuban pianist Chucho Valdés to play the Jazz Plaza Festival in Havana. He has returned in recent years to develop a project that symbolizes the long-awaited relaxing of Cold War hostilities that have defined the relationship between the U.S. and Cuba for half a century. For his forthcoming album, ""Cuba: The Conversation Continues,"" O’Farrill teamed up with a group of six Cuban musicians to reimagine the 1940s encounter between U.S. jazz giant Dizzy Gillespie and Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo. The greats recorded classics like “Manteca” that fused Afro-Cuban rhythms with the emerging bebop style. Many view those collaborations as a pioneering step toward the creation of the now well-defined genre of Latin jazz. Listen to the 1947 recording of “Manteca,” performed by the Dizzie Gillespie Orchestra with Chano Pozo on percussion.For O’Farrill, the fusion between Afro-Cuban music and the American jazz tradition is one that has helped define both his personal and professional lives. “It’s based on a project that’s been cooking in my mind forever,” O’Farrill told The HuffPost. “You see, Diz and Chano understood the African roots of our music are universal… They realized that they were playing the same music, but that it came from different places.’”The new work will debut on Friday in New York’s Symphony Space venue. O'Farrill's Afro Latin Orchestra will be joined by three musicians traveling from the island -- trumpeter Yasek Manzano, pianist Alexis Bosch and Juan de la Cruz Antomarchi, a.k.a. “Cotó,” who plays a traditional double-stringed guitar called the “tres.” U.S. composers Michele Rosewoman and two of the bandleader’s sons, composer Zack O’Farrill and trumpeter Adam O’Farrill, will also make appearances.O’Farrill says he hopes his musical collaborations with artists on the island will help encourage elected officials and policymakers working to mend the fractures U.S.-Cuba relationship. “There’s a lot of suffering and poverty [in Cuba],” O’Farrill said. “But I gotta tell you that there’s a lot of brilliant joy and beauty. I don’t know how they do that. So I said, this is something we’ve got to keep studying, keep working on.” "

ABC 's Diane Sawyer will interview the former Olympic champion and patriarch of the Kardashian television clan in a two-hour interview airing on Friday, April 24. (Photo by Mark Von Holden/Invision/AP, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6739c220000ba01dccee7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yesterday at the gym while stretching post-workout, I overheard two women talking about Bruce Jenner's recent announcement that he was transitioning into a woman. (I wasn't exactly eavesdropping; if you saw the small area devoted to stretching, you'd understand why it isn't easy to ignore nearby conversations.)""Why do you think he waited so long to come out with that?"" asked one. (I had often wondered that myself, but was pretty sure I understood the possible answer.)I was already getting annoyed.She lifted one leg effortlessly into a yoga-like pose, adjusted her stance slightly, then continued. ""I mean, he's old! He's in his sixties, at least! Why even bother to live your life over at that point?""Now I was really annoyed.""Well,"" answered the other, adjusting her posture as she bent down to lay her palms flat onto the floor. ""It's obvious he's going through some sort of midlife crisis.""I had to remind myself to breathe and hold myself back from hurling obscenities her way.I've heard people call Bruce Jenner's announcement a publicity stunt. I've heard some say that he's doing it just for the money. I've seen them roll their eyes. And then again, I've turned a deaf ear to the ones who like to ramble on judgmentally and equally without sympathy about the insanity of it all.Everyone seems to have an opinion. And they're entitled to it.I don't usually get involved in politically-charged conversations, especially with perfect strangers. Come to think of it, I don't like heated discussions even with close friends and family. Call me meek, but I'm happy to call it a typical Libra trait: non-confrontational; valuing fairness and justice above most things; steering clear of conflict or argument.But I really had to fight to keep my mouth shut when I heard that midlife crisis comment. Oh, and that other one about 60 being ""old"" and too late to make changes.First, midlife is not a crisis. Rather, it's a time when we are able to reevaluate our choices in life and realize that there is time to change those choices, turn things around, learn from the past and step forward with renewed wisdom and vigor -- and confidence. I like to call it Midlife Opportunity. In fact, when I started my other blog, MidlifeMatters, in 2009, it was one of the very first things I wrote about.So it's possible, after all, that Bruce Jenner waited all these years because -- simply put -- he realized that now was the right time to do it. Which brings me to my next point about 60 being ""too old."" Banish that thought! I wanted to scream out that day in the gym. I went back to school when I was in midlife and I also ran my first half-marathon at 60. I don't think I'm so special or an aberration, either: there are people in midlife all over the place who are stepping out and starting new and important chapters in their lives. With great accomplishment, I might add.While Jenner admitted that his feelings dated back more than 50 years to when he was 8 or 9 and shamefully tried on his sister's clothes, carefully putting them back exactly where they hung in her closet so he wouldn't be found out, can you imagine coming to real terms with his confused feelings, or even coming close to understanding them, in that era? He, like that entire generation, was caught up in the shame of being different and swept up by the urgent need to conform and belong. And he played that game to its extreme by becoming a idealized physical symbol of a male: athletic, muscular, strong and bold.To me, Jenner is taking the precious years he has left and giving himself -- and many other transgender people -- a precious gift: to live a life in which they are comfortable and secure in who they are. Finally.Crisis? I think not. I think any ""crisis"" Jenner might have been experiencing is a thing of the past. That male/female battle is no longer so tightly locked."

I said, ""good morning, world!"" I sighed in delight, patted Orchid and smiled.I purposely walked outside to write my good morning story. I wanted to be with nature. Other than my family, there is nothing I love more. Nature is Mother Earth... the Universe.I sat down at my charming petite, iron table, with Orchid by my side, and opened my laptop. I looked around at my surroundings. I had created a perfect feng shui environment. I was in the moment with my pooch, my laptop and my second love -- nature.My stories today are short vignettes that hold a special place in my heart. These stories are about gifts from the sea and gifts from the earth. Gifts I have given and gifts I have gotten. One story took place in America on Nantucket Island; another in Ireland and the third vignette took place in Israel. I call these stories, ""Gifts of the Heart.""A Gift From the SeaSeveral years ago my husband, Shelly, and I were walking hand-in-hand in the early hours of the morning along the Atlantic shore. The sun had just peaked her head. We were on Nantucket Island. We were the lone walkers on the beach. As my eyes skirted the vicinity, I noticed in the distance, among very tall reeds, a tall woman with white hair. I noticed she would disappear and then reappear! ""I would love to meet that woman,"" I said to Shelly.""What woman?"" He asked.""The woman in the not-too-far distance,"" I replied.""Why is that important to you?""""I'm inquisitive,"" I explained. I want to know what is she doing out here alone in the tall reeds. She keeps bending over and then standing up.""""Alright, let's go,"" said Shelly.We had to push the reeds back as we made our way to her side.She was almost six feet tall, with silver hair worn in a bun. She had a bronze glow to her skin, beautiful, clear blue eyes and strong, large hands. She was dressed in a long blue dress that resembled a pinafore with an apron tied around her waist and under her pinafore she wore a crisp white shirt. I imagined her to be in her eighties.She smiled. We smiled.""Good morning,"" we said. ""We walked over to see what you are doing.""""I am shelling... collecting shells,"" she replied.""I love sea shells,"" I declared. ""I love everything that has to do with the sea.""She then opened her apron and showed me her morning collection of the most amazing seashells I had ever seen.""What do you do with all these shells?"" I inquired.""I collect shells for the shell shop in town. Today I found the most beautiful shell. Look!""""Do you know its name? I asked.""Yes, it is called a Moon Shell.""She noticed I could not take my eyes off this exquisitely-patterned shell and said, smiling, ""I would like to give it to you! Please accept this as my gift from the sea.""She continued, ""Take it home, wash it in bleach to clean out the animal and the bleach will bring back its natural color.""I looked up at her and replied, ""Thank you. I will always treasure your gift.""We said our goodbyes. I carefully wrapped my moon shell and carried her back to Chicago. I followed the instructions from the 'woman in blue,' and then placed my beautiful white shell into a glass box with lid so I could view her every day. Moon Shell sits on my desk today... 15 years later! The joy this small gift brings cannot be measured in words. I wish I could once again thank 'the woman in blue.'Two Daughters, Two Hearts, Two Valentine's Day Presents  This story took place about ten years ago as Shelly and I drove around the Ring of Kerry in Ireland.One of our stops was at a famous lake that grants wishes if you dip your hands in the water. I could not resist!""Let's walk down to the lake,"" I said to Shelly.The walk down was laden with medium-sized rocks in all shapes and sizes. It was a difficult walk. You could trip or lose your balance because the rocks moved as you walked. You had to keep your eyes glued to the ground as you proceeded down to the water's edge.As I neared the water, I saw two medium-sized rocks lying side by side. I truly believe that a million people would never have noticed these rocks. To my eye they looked liked abstract hearts.I let go of Shelly's hand and bent down to pick them up.""What are you doing?"" Shelly asked.""What do these rocks remind you of?"" I asked.""I don't know,"" was the answer I expected.""They are abstract hearts! I am going to take them home, write a saying on each rock in red magic marker and give them to Jenny and Lizzie for Valentine's presents!""Shelly just smiled. Squeezed my hand and kissed my cheek.When I give gifts, thought wins over cost.But I must admit that I did not think these two rocks would have such an impact on my daughters. I was overjoyed when I saw the heart's importance. Overjoyed because my daughters visualized their mother finding them on the shoreline of Ireland... and thinking of them.My daughters have perfume trays in their baths. One daughter lives in Chicago. The other daughter lives in Arizona. I noticed years ago that both of my daughters placed their Valentine rock with their Mother's words of love on their perfume trays. They still sit there today.A Grandson's Gift to His HoneyMy grandson, Robbie, was traveling to Israel on Birth Right, a great trip for young people. He always brings me a present from his travels.""Honey, what would you like me to bring you from Israel?"" Robbie asked.""Nothing from the store. A gift from the land would be a treasure,"" I replied.I was not disappointed in this grandson of mine. He brought me a perfectly-shaped round rock. It looks like sand and it is sturdy and hard like the State of Israel.It is a treasured gift because it came from my grandson and the land of Israel. My rock sits on my desk along with my Moon Stone.I have taught this to my children and grandchildren by my words and my gifts. Little treasures from Honey... straight from the heart.These are my words to them:""Gifts do not have to cost money to bring joy to your family and friends. The joy of a material possession lasts but for the moment. A gift from the heart lasts... a lifetime.""Have a wonderful day my ""honey bee"" readers. Until next time...Warmly,  Honey GoodImage Sources: 1, 2"

The problem largely stems from the way credit cards are viewed today. They are typically perceived as a ""last resort"" for consumers who can't afford to pay for their purchases. In reality, credit cards are an essential tool - for the right consumer, they can serve to improve financial standing and even earn them money. You should consider applying for a credit card if:You Have a Bad Credit Score Responsibly using one's credit card, and paying off balances, is a fantastic way of rebuilding your credit history. Individuals who have defaulted loans, declared bankruptcy, or damaged their FICO score in any other way may be distrustful or weary of taking out any more credit. However, these consumers need to try and think of credit cards as a tool rather than a crutch. Making small credit card purchases and paying them off in full each month can serve to mend a tarnished credit history. While you may not get approved for the best cards available, a secured or entry level credit card may still be available to you.You Travel Frequently Some of the best credit card rewards are those affiliated with airlines and hotel chains. When you pay for your travel purchases using these cards, you will earn rewards which can be, in the future, redeemed for more flights or nights. Each of your travel expenses will be offset by some rewards percentage - effectively working as a 2-4% discount. The only caveat is that this will rarely be a pure cash discount. Instead, you will be rewarded in the form of points or frequent flyer miles. However, if you are a frequent traveler, you will undoubtedly be able to make use of such rewards.You Plan to Take Out a Mortgage Even though buying a house or apartment may seem like the distant future, it is never too early to start preparing. The same way in which putting money away in your savings account is planting seeds that will help with your future purchase, using a credit card to slowly build up your credit history helps as well. Your credit score will predominantly affect two things when it comes to a big purchase: loan approval and interest rates. The higher your FICO score, the better your odds of being approved for your mortgage. Furthermore, a good credit score correlates with low interest rates - this will ultimately decrease the total cost of your investment, as you will pay less interest on your purchase.You Want to Get the Most Out of Each Purchase If you use the right rewards credit card to make your purchases, while at the same time diligently paying off your balance in full each month, you are getting the most out of each purchase. Banks are vying for your business, and as a result rewards programs on credit cards are getting better and better due to fierce competition among issuers. If you use the right cash back credit card, for example, you can earn 2% off all your spending. Paying by cash or other means simply doesn't provide anything like it.Bottom Line Underlying all these points is a central theme of fiscal responsibility. You should never use a credit card if you will end up paying fees or interest. The ads that come in your mail, the banker, or some website talking about credit cards - none of these things know your personal habits as well as you do. If you know you can use credit cards responsibly, they can act to provide you with fantastic value. Making these little pieces of plastic work for you can strengthen your financial portfolio and put a few extra bucks in your pocket!"

That's about where the similarity ends. Searching for Sugar Man concentrated on Sixto Rodriguez, an American singer and Don't Think I've Forgotten, playing at Film Forum through Tuesday, April 28 deals with an idyllic period of Cambodia's early independence from French rule when Western influences from France's Johnny Hallyday, to Afro-Cuban, Santana and even Wilson Picket intermingled with a burgeoning Cambodian pop culture. That culture produced crooners with names like Sinn Sisamouth, Ros Sereysothea, Pan Ron and Mao Sereth who dominated the Pnom Penh musical scene. King Norodom Sihanouk, who ruled the country during those alternately repressive but culturally halcyon times, was the Maecenas of Cambodian art and created an atmosphere which allowed Cambodian music to move away from its purely traditional roots and participate in the tidal wave of 60's rock. ""When we were young we loved being modern,"" is one of the first testimonies of the film which highlights a music that was characterized by a realism extraordinary even in the age of rock. ""Please stop asking about your father,"" begins one lyric, 'he's a womanizer and an embarrassment."" The Radio Diffusion Nationale Khmere which had broadcast Cambodian rock silenced it when the Khmer Rouge came to power in l975. Searching for Sugar Man was also different from Don't Think I've Forgotten in that the form it took was that of a mystery circling around the whereabouts of the elusive Sixto Rodriguez. There's no mystery about what happened to Sinn Sisamouth and his pals. Most of them were murdered.{This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"
