It may frustrate customers with poor service, anger employees with unpleasant working conditions or low pay, and fail shareholders with poor returns. Often, these shortcomings are intertwined and it’s usually enough for a company to antagonize one of these groups for its reputation — and even its operations and finances — to suffer.Many of the most-hated companies have millions of customers and hundreds of thousands of workers. With this kind of reach, it’s important to keep employees happy in order to maintain decent customer service. Often, poor job satisfaction leads to poor service and low customer satisfaction. McDonald’s and Walmart have risked this most recently as employees and some customers have protested the low wages at these companies — low enough to put workers below the poverty line.Mass layoffs also contribute to low worker morale. Some of the most-hated companies have significantly reduced their workforces. BlackBerry, for one, has cut a third of its headcount as competitors Apple and Samsung have taken most of its market share. Wall Street has accused BlackBerry’s (NASDAQ: BBRY) management of missing the rapid adoption of consumer-friendly smartphones.Click here to see the most hated companiesSeveral organizations have managed to avoid this list by reclaiming some of their reputation in recent months. In 2012, the Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) IPO imploded and the company continued to face backlash because of its shifting privacy policies. In 2013, however, the social network’s share price soared and attention to its privacy issues dropped considerably.T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) had a difficult 2012, losing scores of subscribers and receiving poor marks for customer service. But it had a much better 2013. In May, the company added 9 million new customers when it acquired Metro PCS. It has continued to add customers due to a new strategy that splits phone payments from service fees.Many of the most-hated companies botched a product or a service. BlackBerry’s most recent line of smartphones, the Q10 and Z10, launched in a desperate attempt to take back some of the smartphone market, failed to catch on. Another major flop was the new store layout and pricing at JC Penney (NYSE: JCP), which alienated consumers and, eventually, investors.Nothing harms the long-term reputation of a company, at least in the eyes of investors, more than a steep drop in its share price. The stocks of several of the most-hated companies posted double-digit percentage declines in the past year. This certainly happened to J.C. Penney, which has been swamped by competition from other large retailers, ranging from Macy’s (NYSE: M) to Target (NYSE: TGT). Similarly, lululemon’s (NASDAQ: LULU) stock was hammered following the see-through yoga pants scandal that put the brakes on the company’s rapid revenue growth and resulted in the resignation of its chairman.It is worth noting that some of the companies on the list may have performed very poorly by some measures but well by others. A few of the most-hated companies have had good stock performance. Others have relatively satisfied customers. All of this was taken into account in compiling the final list.To identify the most hated companies in America, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed a variety of metrics for customer satisfaction, stock performance, and employee satisfaction. This included total return to shareholders compared to the broader market and other companies in the same sector in the past 52 weeks. We considered customer data from a number of sources, including the Consumer Reports Naughty & Nice list, the ForeSee Experience Index, and the American Customer Satisfaction Index. We also included employee satisfaction based on worker opinion scores recorded by Glassdoor. Finally, we considered management decisions made in the past year that hurt a company’s image and brand value, as measured by marketing research firms BrandZ and Interbrand.These are the 10 most-hated companies in America, according to 24/7 Wall St.:"

Household net worth has rebounded back to roughly where it was before the financial crisis.Why? A surge in stock and real estate prices. The stock market is up 46% since the end of 2010. And after years of pain, housing prices are rising too.More from Quartz: -- Why every gadget you own could soon take voice commands just like Siri -- Inside Jeff Zucker’s plan to save CNN -- December’s weather was so terrible, it kept a quarter million Americans home from work -- Making time for workouts can actually help you have it allThere’s a catch. While about 50% of Americans own some kind of stocks—either individual shares or mutual funds—the richest Americans own most of the market. That means most of the exceptional stock market gains accrued to what Federal Reserve research describe as “a small number of wealthy families.”Homeownership is a bit more democratic. Houses account for a larger chunk of the assets of the US middle-class compared to the wealthy. But again, the poor are left out.No, the poor rely not on asset prices, but on wages, Social Security, and government transfer payments for their income. That hasn’t been a good place in recent years. Wages have been stagnant. Government transfer payments have been under fire. (Extended unemployment benefits expired late last month for roughly 1.4 million Americans after a federal program lapsed. And it seems like the US Congress is set to cut transfer payments such as the US food stamps program.)Economists argue that things like food stamps and unemployment act as crucial bits of stimulus when the economy is weak. Cutting them can act as a headwind to growth. That’s certainly the case for low-end retailers such as Family Dollar. The store chain’s shares fell sharply this week after it reported disappointing earnings. Family Dollar CEO Howard Levine had this to say on the subject:For the last several quarters, we’ve discussed the economic challenges our customers are facing. Over the last two years, I think we’ve seen a growing bifurcation in households. Higher-income households who have benefited from market gains, better employment opportunities, or improvements in the housing markets have become more comfortable and confident in their financial situation. But our core lower-income customers have faced high unemployment levels, higher payroll taxes, and more recently reductions in government-assistance programs. All of these factors have resulted in incremental financial pressure and reduction in overall spend in the market.Translation? As poor Americans come under more and more pressure, more and more of Family Dollar’s revenue is tied to low-margin sales of necessities like food. (Sales were strongest during the first fiscal quarter in Family Dollar’s “consumables” category, especially in areas like frozen food.)The fact that so many Americans are being forced to curtail spending at the cheapest discount retailers should give anybody cheering the US recovery something to think about."

The Globes used to hand out two New Star of the Year accolades, one male and one female. They were discontinued in 1983. Winners included Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mia Farrow, Diana Ross and Bette Midler. Unsurprisingly, Meryl Streep holds the record for the most nominations. She has 28 nods and eight wins, for ""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" ""The French Lieutenant's Woman,"" ""Sophie's Choice,"" ""Adaptation.,"" ""Angels in America,"" ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" ""Julie & Julia"" and ""The Iron Lady.""  (Streep and Nicole Kidman celebrate their 2003 wins for ""Adaptation."" and ""The Hours,"" respectively. Streep co-starred in ""The Hours"" and was nominated opposite Kidman for Best Actress - Drama.) For many years, the Globes had no host and awards were handed out by journalists in attendance. That changed in 1958 when the Rat Pack stormed the stage and took over unofficial hosting duties. Ricky Gervais was the show's first hosts since John Larroquette and Janine Turner emceed in 1995. Four actors have gone home with two awards in the same year: Sigourney Weaver (1989, for ""Gorillas in the Mist: The Story of Dian Fossey"" and ""Working Girl""), Joan Plowright (1993, for ""Enchanted April"" and ""Stalin""), Helen Mirren (2007, for ""The Queen"" and ""Elizabeth I"") and Kate Winslet (2010, for ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""The Reader""). Julia-Louis Dreyfus, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris Elba are among the stars who have a chance to join that list this year. The Globes' first trophy originated in 1945, one year after the inaugural awards. Members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association held a contest to design a statuette that would reflect their aim to honor the best in film. The group's president, Marina Cisternas, crafted a golden globe with a filmstip wrapped around it and mounted on a pedestal.  (Lois Maxwell is seen with her 1948 trophy for New Actress of the Year, which she won for ""That Hagen Girl."") Miss Golden Globe was instated in 1963. This year, Sosie Bacon (below) will take over the duties. Previous Miss Golden Globes who've gone on to see fame include Melanie Griffith, Laura Dern, Joely Fisher, Tara Reid and Freddie Prinze Jr., who is one of only a few Mr. Golden Globes. The television prizes were added in 1956. Since then, only one other category -- Best Animated Feature, which was introduced in 2007 -- has joined the roster of awards. ""Cars,"" ""Ratatouille,"" ""WALL-E,"" ""Up,"" ""Toy Story 3,"" ""The Adventures of Tintin"" and ""Brave"" have since won.  (""Cars"" director John Lasseter accepts in 2007.)Robert Redford is this year's nominee whose first win was the longest ago. (He took home 1966's Most Promising Newcomer honor, for ""Inside Daisy Clover."") Lupita Nyong'o's (""12 Years a Slave"") and Barkhad Abdi's (""Captain Phillips"") nominations are in honor of their first film roles ever. The Cecil B. DeMille Award has been handed out 60 times. Only a dozen women have been the recipients. Judy Garland remains both the first female and youngest winner in the award's history. The oldest was 90-year-old studio mogul Samuel Goldwyn. Only two African-Americans have won: Sidney Poitier and Morgan Freeman. This year's honoree, the notoriously awards-adverse Woody Allen, has said he will not attend the ceremony. Diane Keaton will accept in his stead. Allen is taking a note out of Marlon Brando's playbook. Brando refused the Golden Globe he won in 1973 for ""The Godfather,"" using it as opportunity to protest U.S. “imperialism and racism."" Kerry Washington is the first black female to crack a leading-actress TV category (comedy or drama) since Regina Young was up for ""I'll Fly Away"" in 1992. Six of 2014's TV actor nominees received film nods in previous years.: Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright, Don Cheadle, Michael J. Fox, Jon Voight, Janet McTeer. Julia-Louis Dreyfus joins that list thanks to her dual nominations this year, for HBO's ""Veep"" and the movie ""Enough Said."" Critics were so shocked when ""The Tourist"" and ""Burlesque"" racked up multiple high-profile nominations in 2011 that reports accused Sony, the movies' distributor, of bribing HFPA voters with an all-expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas and a meet-and-greet with Cher. The Globes' reputation for filling nomination slots with critically panned movies didn't begin with ""The Tourist"" and ""Burlesque."" The most infamous example came in 1982 when Pia Zadora, star of the lambasted movie ""Butterfly,"" took home New Star of the Year the same year she garnered Worst Actress and Worst New Star at the Golden Raspberry Awards. Reports then surfaced that Zadora's husband, Israeli multimillionaire Meshulam Riklis, had flown HFPA members to Vegas -- sound familiar? -- to watch Zadora perform. Other surprising nods in recent years include Kevin Spacey for ""Casino Jack,"" Sarah Jessica Parker for ""The Family Stone,"" ""Patch Adams"" for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Jim Carrey for ""Liar Liar."" If either ""American Hustle"" or ""12 Years a Slave"" -- this year's most-nominated movies -- sweeps up all of its categories, it would be the first movie to do so since 1975's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" Christine Lahti had to be summoned out of the bathroom when she won in 1998 for Best Actress in a Television Series - Drama.""Nashville"" (1975) is the most-nominated movie in Globes history, with nine nods. (It only took home one trophy, for Best Original Song.) ""Cabaret,"" ""Bugsy"" and ""Titanic"" each received eight nominations.

The 29-year-old actress starred in Joseph Gordon-Levitt's feature-length writing and directorial debut, ""Don Jon,"" appeared on Broadway in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" and filmed ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" all while also finding the time to take on a ""little"" voiceover project in the now critically-acclaimed Spike Jonze film, ""Her."" Not to mention Johansson was just named the first-ever Global Brand Ambassador for SodaStream International Ltd. and will be kicking off the partnership by starring in a Super Bowl XLVIII commercial on Feb. 2. The Huffington Post sat down with Johansson at the Gramercy Park Hotel in New York City on Jan. 10 to discuss her unfortunate disqualification from the Golden Globe Awards, her experience working with Jonze and Joaquin Phoenix on ""Her"" and what it's like playing a supporting role in someone else's Marvel movie. (Her hotel room was ""freezing,"" so she wrapped herself up in a blanket and got comfy on the couch with some candy).There has been a lot of buzz surrounding your performance in ""Her."" What do you think about being deemed ineligible for a Golden Globe nomination?I didn't expect to be recognized for the Golden Globes because I think they always have said that it was not a type of performance that they would recognize. Of course, I never expect to be nominated for anything [laughs]. I worked in the post-production part of it -- I mean, I worked on it for months, but it was in a totally different way. Working with Joaquin and working with Spike in this really intimate way -- kind of isolated, the three of us -- really allowed me to focus on how to develop this character and what needed to be in the relationship that wasn't there, and how could this character become kind of independent of Theodore [Phoenix's character] and independent of her own programming. I needed to create something that was tangible out of an idea that feels really abstract. And that kind of work that I did with Spike felt like we were making our own separate film that any recognition or all that stuff, for me, is really, totally unexpected and surprising. I'm excited for Spike because its a project that, when he came to me, he had been working on for a long time. He had come to a point where he really needed a partner in this relationship, and so, for me, just to see the film be recognized and people responding to the relationship and to see that it's working, I'm like, ""Yes! We did it.""Samantha Morton originally voiced the part of Samantha during the production of ""Her"" Did you reach out to her before taking on the role in post-production?Firstly, I absolutely adore Samantha Morton's work, I don't know her personally, but she's a wonderful actor. And it was not about that the quality of her performance was off. What I really talked to Spike about was how he wanted the character to evolve in the script as he had written it. I didn't really talk about how it would be a different performance from hers because we're different actors and certainly we have different qualities. But, I know that he spoke to her about it and they worked extensively on it and, certainly, whatever performance Joaquin gives is as much a reaction to Samantha's performance and the work that I did after in post. I guess it's a collaborative performance in that way. Was it daunting to do a voiceover rather than work with Joaquin face-to-face during scenes?Joaquin was there when I recorded, so I did get to work opposite him. It was wonderful, he was so dedicated. He basically did the movie twice. You know, working with Spike, we actually did the movie like 400 times because I feel like we recorded the film in its entirety that many times [laughs]. It's funny because when my agent presented me with the project, before Spike and I had even spoken, I was doing ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" in New York and I was about to go on to ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and I was doing a bunch of other stuff and he was like, ""Oh, you know, it's like a few days, it's like a vocal thing."" And I was like, ""Okay, let me try it out."" And I looked at the script, and I was like, ""It seems extensive."" So I met with Spike and he's like, ""Oh, it's just a re-recorded thing."" And at our first meeting, before we even agreed to work together, it was almost like testing out cars. Like, how does this fit with me? Can I be responsive? And Spike and I spent nine hours in his apartment and at the end of it he fed me, like, stale hummus or something, I was like, ""I'm starving! You're not paying me for this session, I'm hungry. I'm broke now. You took up all my time. I have a play to do tomorrow ... twice."" But he and I both kind of looked at each other and were like are we really going to do this together because I was like, ""This is a lot of work Spike."" And he was like, ""I know."" I was like, ""You knew this, and you didn't tell me!""It is difficult because you are so focused on the nuance, on the intonation, it's like you're hyper-aware, but it's liberating. And I loved working on it and I was excited to take on the challenge, even though I didn't have any time [laughs]. But I was like, ""Wow, this is going to be really hard and I've never done anything like this before, so let's do it."" And just the fact that I didn't know how I was going to do it or if it was going to work was exciting. Of course, if that relationship doesn't work in this movie, then it's like, what is there? So that's the most exciting part about people responding to it, because it's like, yeah, it came across in the work that we did, so that's cool. What was more difficult, filming the nude scenes in ""Under the Skin"" or the sex scene in ""Her""?Both were difficult because you're naked in many ways, even when you're not literally naked. ""Her"" was intense -- I know Joaquin had a hard time with it too. It's like very intense, you know, because you can't kind of hide behind the beautiful lights. It's so stark, you know, who wants to hear themselves talk? I was like, ""Please, at the end of this take, do not play any of that back."" I don't even like to hear myself on a voicemail, you know? So it was very intimate, but it was cool, it works. You have to let go of your inhibition and just do it. And the same goes in ""Under the Skin."" You start to go, ""Oh, I'm really self-conscious about these things. Why? What is it about my body or what am I worried that people are going to see or what am I seeing? What do I think about myself this way?"" And then you go, ""Okay, I have to, like, liberate."" Especially in that film because the character has no judgement of her own body, she's not in her own skin. She's not a self, she's becoming a self, but it's this huge transition that she's making toward self-discovery and why this is what my body is like. She's not going, ""Oh, I'm looking fine in this light or I'm looking lumpy,"" you know what I mean? She's not thinking any of that, so I was like, ""Okay, I have to get rid of that."" And that's the challenge in both cases, is that, these characters are very different, but, in some ways the similarities are that they're completely liberated of their own like self-awareness. Of course, Samantha has doubts but those doubts fade as her confidence builds and she never goes back to that place. ""Avengers"" had a true ensemble cast. Now you're in someone else's movie again. How does ""Captain America"" differ from ""Iron Man 2""?My first Marvel film was ""Iron Man 2"" and then we did ""The Avengers"" and then Chris Evans and I did ""Cap 2,"" but I think that film, there's a couple of new characters. The Falcon [played by Anthony Mackie] is a new character in that, and of course Sebastian Stan is kind of continuing his character, obviously he's playing the Winter Soldier. But these characters really kind of take on something bigger than they've ever seen, so I think it's something that they can't do without each other. In that sense, we were in it, kind of neck-and-neck, and it's a bigger responsibility. But then again, even in ""Avengers 2,"" we all play in it, it's not like, ""Great, I'll be booking, like, two days a week and then be eating sandwiches the rest of the week."" No, it's on. We all are fighting in it together, we're all fighting our own battles and our own demons and it's a lot of dramatic work, and the physical part of it, so the films all have their own challenges, but it's fun. And hey, there's a lot of good looking guys to be surrounded by ...I know! It's exhausting! You know what I mean? They spend more time getting ready in the trailer than I do. ""Her"" is playing in theaters now. ""Under the Skin and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" are both set to be released in April 2014.Scarlett Johansson is thrilled to be teaming up with SodaStream. She tells The Huffington Post, ""It's a product I've used for six or seven years and pushed on all my family and friends. It's a good fit, we share a lot of the same core values. Partly why I use the product is the message that they're selling, which is the belief in reducing your own carbon footprint and still being able to enjoy the product in the same way you would any other soda. They're not using high fructose corn syrup, they're not using Aspartame, it's incredible the impact they could make if everybody is enjoying this at home and not buying cans and plastic bottles."""

Forgetting the contents of the monologue onstage? Stumping for a particular movie to win? How about leaking a copy of an awards contender online?Ellen DeGeneres has been accused of doing the latter -- or at least someone in her camp has. Earlier this week, ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" made its way onto piracy sites with a watermark bearing the Oscar host's name. The original assumption was that the Academy screener sent to ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" was the one that leaked, but a rep for 20th Century Fox, the movie's distributor, confirmed to Variety that it was actually a copy of the movie sent in advance of Ben Stiller's Dec. 4 appearance on the talk show.The news of the leak first broke on Thursday at the hands of former Kickstarter CTO Andy Baio, who runs the technology blog Waxy. He posted a GIF from the ""Walter Mitty"" screener that contains the words ""Ellen DeGeneres 11/26/13"" in large white type at the bottom of the screen. Baio also reported that Academy screeners of ""Frozen,"" ""Her"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" appeared online on Wednesday as well. DeGeneres herself has steered clear of addressing the mix-up, but the executive producers of her show issued this statement: “Our show is sent advanced screeners of movies, sitcoms, reality shows, CDs, etc. before guests appear on our show. We do everything we can to protect the content and in 11 seasons nothing has ever leaked online from our show. We’re not sure if this leaked from our show or not, but we are doing everything we can to find out and to make sure it never happens again.”While it's certainly not uncommon for movies to leak online -- last year's most-pirated movie, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" was downloaded 8.4 million times -- it is rare for the source to be linked back to an industry insider. Baio reminds us on Waxy of 2011's ""Super 8"" leak, which came with a watermark containing Howard Stern's name.Two years ago, Baio wrote an extensive piece for Wired in which he tracked trends associated with the Academy's screener leaks. Baio reported that, as of Jan. 26, 2012, -- exactly a month before the Oscars were to air -- eight of the 33 awards screeners disseminated had leaked online. Factoring in 10 years' worth of data, he called that number a ""record low."" (Still, non-screener versions of most of the other films leaked anyway. The only three contenders spared the illegal treatment as of the article's publication were ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"" ""My Week with Marilyn"" and ""W.E."")Unfortunately for ""Walter Mitty,"" this mild controversy is where its Oscar conversation ends. The movie, directed by and starring Stiller in an adaptation of James Thurber's 1939 short story, was once a putative awards contender but has fizzled far from the Oscar radar thanks to mixed reviews and a slate of movies that's overflowing with more highbrow fare."

(AP Photo/Lenny Ignelzi )",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb738612100002501c8e99b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Joe Fortenbaugh, National Football PostThey said the quarterback was washed up and the defense was in need of a major overhaul. The offensive line was considered by some to be the worst in the National Football League, while the starting running back was headed for enshrinement as one of the biggest first-round busts of the last decade. The receivers were either inexperienced or inconsistent, the pass rushers ineffective, the special teams far from special. This was a franchise located in an attractive part of the country with talent that was anything but.The expectations had reached their lowest point in years. This was a rebuilding project that would take time and require patience. The playoffs—a feat which hadn’t been achieved in any of the previous three seasons despite the predictions of many that such an goal would be reached—was something that was possibly worth pondering somewhere down the road.This roster wasn’t capable of qualifying for the postseason, they said.Yet, here stands first-year head coach Mike McCoy and the San Diego Chargers, winners of five straight and, once again, assuming the role of underdog for Sunday’s Divisional Round matchup at Denver.The quarterback, 32-year-old Philip Rivers, is in the midst of a renaissance that has seen the ten-year veteran transform a two-year freefall (35 interceptions and 79 sacks absorbed over 32 starts) into a passer rating of 105.5 (highest since 2008) and a trip to Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Some predicted Rivers would be cut loose to free up salary cap space following one season in McCoy’s system, but the North Carolina State product wound up finishing the 2013 campaign ranked first in the NFL in completion percentage (69.5 percent), fifth in passing yards (4,478), fourth in touchdown tosses (32) and fourth in passer rating (105.5).The defense, a unit that, at times, appeared semi-respectable in 2012, needed exactly 11 games under defensive coordinator John Pagano before kicking it into high gear for an improbable playoff run. Through the first 11 games of the season, San Diego surrendered a staggering 29.5 points per game en route to a 5-6 record. But after the calendar flipped to December, this unit bolted down the hatches and permitted an average of just 16.3 points per outing while going 5-1, a record that includes last Sunday’s 27-10 wild card upset win at Cincinnati, a team that had not lost a single game at home during the regular season.The offensive line, an unreliable and suspect bunch that had surrendered 79 sacks over the previous two seasons (12th-most in NFL), allowed Rivers to hit the deck just 30 times over 16 starts this year, 19 fewer than had been given up in 2012. And that’s despite the loss of offensive guard Louis Vasquez, who signed with division-rival Denver this past winter before earning All-Pro honors protecting future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning.The running back, former Fresno State standout Ryan Mathews (whom the Chargers acquired in the 2010 draft after trading up to the 12th pick from the 28th selection), just completed the first full 16-game regular season of his four-year NFL run, which featured career-highs in rushing yards (1,255, seventh in NFL) and attempts (285, fourth in NFL). During San Diego’s four-game winning streak to close out the regular season, Mathews found the end zone three times while averaging 118.25 rushing yards per game.The receiving unit, which dumped Norv Turner acquisition Robert Meachem (costing the team $6.875 million in dead money against the 2013 salary cap) and lost their top receiver in Malcom Floyd to injury just two games into the regular season, struck gold in rookie third-round pick Keenan Allen, who ranked 22nd in the NFL in receiving yards (1,046) and 16th in touchdowns (8). The 21-year-old out of California hit pay dirt five times during San Diego’s season-ending four-game winning streak.They said a lot of things about the San Diego Chargers prior to the start of the 2013 regular season. They also said the Bolts didn’t stand a chance when visiting Super Bowl favorite Denver on a Thursday night in mid-December.In what should be regarded as one of the finest displays of coaching to take place during the 2013 NFL campaign, Mike McCoy’s Chargers systematically dismantled a Broncos team that had won 13 consecutive home games prior to San Diego’s visit. The Chargers controlled the clock for an astonishing 38:49, converted 50 percent of their third down opportunities and limited quarterback Peyton Manning to his second-lowest passer rating of the year. The league’s top offense by a mile this season, Denver was held to under 400 total yards in their 27-20 defeat to San Diego in Week 15 for just the second time all year.The other instance? Well, that came back on November 10 when the Broncos registered 397 yards against, you guessed it, the San Diego Chargers.They say that Mike McCoy won’t win NFL Coach of the Year honors, not when competing in a race that includes Carolina’s Ron Rivera, Kansas City’s Andy Reid and Arizona’s Bruce Arians. Deserving candidates in their own right, Arians fell short of an impressive playoff bid, Reid’s Chiefs blew a 28-point lead at Indianapolis last Sunday and Rivera’s campaign will likely be second-guessed if his 12-win Panthers fall at home to San Francisco on Sunday coming off a bye week.They say that the 10-point underdog San Diego Chargers won’t win in Denver this Sunday. Not against a rested, record-setting Peyton Manning who seems destined for a third trip to the Super Bowl. What they say at this point has become old hat for these Chargers because they’ve heard it all before.The key, however, is that they’ve chosen not to listen.Hit me up on Twitter: @JoeFortenbaugh"

Whether it is a nightmare or a pleasant dream, you alone will sweat or smile. She would then advise to have pleasant thoughts during the day, and do no wrong that it comes to haunt you in your dreams. Simplistically, if you do wrong, it's your hiney that will be hauled off to the jail, and you have to live with the torment and pain... others can bail you out, but cannot live with the feelings but sympathize. You have to live your life yourselves. Then she would describe the end days, whether it is imaginary or real, but the feeling is real. On the last day, the Armageddon or Qayamat (Islamic belief), everything around you goes bonkers and everyone is looking to save his own tail. There will be no one for you, as each one is busy saving his or her own. I won't be there for you, and when you have kids, they will not be there for you either; you are on your own. So, she would add learn to take responsibility for the outcomes and live with it.Those who do not believe in God, can imagine reflecting in solitude, and reckoning the good, bad and ugly things they have said and done like every one else. Do they feel joyful, remorseful and anxious? Religiously that is reward and punishment. Do you recall the announcement on the airplanes? In case oxygen level drops, the mask will drop from the overhead compartment, please secure yourselves first, and then take care of your child and others. I have learned that, ultimately no one but you is responsible for your happiness, a state of mind where we are most comfortable, secure and without fear. I have learned that we really do have the choice to make what we make of life. Happiness is not dependent on the things you have or the friends or family members you have, but rather your attitude towards your situation. You can blame others and other things, but that will not change how you feel inside, you will have to live with yourselves. Take charge of your life, and be yourselves. From this moment forward, make a commitment, however stupid it sounds, that you will be happy regardless of what surrounds you, and you are not a puppy to dance to the tunes of others, unless you choose to dance. Let life and all the things about life become your choices that do not mean you oppose everything, it simply means whatever your do in life, and you do it wholeheartedly.You can make your life purposeful, meaningful and enjoyable, and can choose to be the driver of your life or be driven by others. The choice as well as the excuse is yours. I pray that we retain the ability to choose what we want in our lives. Success is not necessarily driving a Mercedes, having a luxury home, yacht or making over a six-figure income. It is not about doing better than your friends, classmates, siblings or parents either. Success is rather living the life you want to live with or without things. Nothing in life is more important than knowing yourselves, who you are, what is that you want and how do you get it. Remember, no one but you knows you better. Another year is about to go away. Some of my friends will read this note next year, but those who read it now, I urge you to consider spending an hour with yourselves creating a purposeful blueprint for 2014. The blue print is here.Wish you happiness today, tomorrow and forever, the decision is yours."

Often, a very important message for the dreamer that has been ignored will repeat until it's understood, or worked through by the dreamer. It's kind of like the dream is saying, ""Hey! Remember me? I'm back! When are you going to pay attention to me?!""   Some anxiety-based dreams will repeat tasks that are unfinished in the dreamer's waking life. These kinds of repetitive dreams tend to repeat until the waking life task at hand is completed.  Other anxiety-based dreams can continue the dreamer's waking life tasks into the dreamtime, even if those tasks have already been completed. These kinds of dreams repeat as often as necessary in order for the dreamer to process what is referred to among dream researchers as, ""daily residue.""  Although it is tempting to think of these ""daily residue"" dreams as unimportant, the process of decompressing from daily events or getting clear about what needs to be done the next day are very important -- even if they are experienced as less exciting than some other types of dreams.  When people have experienced trauma, such as returning veterans and others with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), they will often have recurring nightmares replaying traumatic events they have experienced. Many people who do not suffer from PTSD also might experience a recurring nightmare. A nightmare that recurs can present a valuable opportunity for self-reflection and growth -- whether inspired by trauma or not.   There are ways of working with recurring disempowering dreams that are in the service of health and wholeness for the dreamer. For example, there is a common recurring dream of being chased that can transform into facing the chaser and building courage, as well as lucidity.   Some examples in film that demonstrate this are: The Matrix, when Neo becomes fearless, faces his chaser and stops bullets with his mind, and Tim Burton's, Alice in Wonderland when Alice faces the Jabberwocky because she is no longer afraid of it and realizes she is ""the one"" (dreaming). Usually, people need some dream education and the guidance and support of others when initially learning these skills.  Sometimes, people have recurring dreams that are pleasurable, too. An example of this would be: a woman has recurring dreams of making love with a movie star that she finds attractive. In this example, the woman might dream about this actor for as many times as it takes until she (usually subconsciously) feels she has integrated a masculine or feminine aspect of herself that the actor represented. At the point when she feels like she's over it, and the dreams stop... the qualities she admired in that actor have usually integrated into her own personality in one way or another. This example applies to everyone, regardless of gender.  Have you ever had recurring dreams and if so, what could they be trying to tell you?

I tell the young lady in the office that disabled placards or plates are for drivers who are actually disabled or when the disabled person is being driven, but are not to be used when the disabled person is not driving or being transported. She says that she has a disabled tag for an older relative and that in Michigan, it is legal to use it for parking in a blue space even without the disabled person. ""That's not right."" I say. ""You're denying the space to someone who really needs it."" She maintains her position. ""C'mon,"" I say, ""You know better than that!"" Even though she still maintains that it's okay, I can see her thinking about this. The next day, I see her making sure that someone parking in the disabled zone is legitimate, and from this point on she always comes over and makes sure I have a space. One time when she's in the rover truck she sees me entering the garage and swings back around to help me find a space. The day before I'm set to leave Detroit, I stop in the office and we chat. ""I get up at 5:30 every morning and don't get home till after midnight. I work here and I'm going to school to be a pharmacy technician so I can make more money with less hours and spend time with my daughter,"" she says. ""What's your daughter's age?"" I ask. ""She's 6."" ""Going on?"" ""Going on 30... just the other day she was talking about school and asked me 'Mom, why are the children so noisy?'

She tells me she's the fourth of eight children herself, the only one with a ""non-normal"" name, that she takes care of her older sister as well, who has health and mobility complications. I ask if I can make a small contribution to her gasoline fund. She accepts and I give her something from my wallet. We hug. I ask if we can make a picture and she says ""Yes...

Scientists who sparked an outcry by creating easier-to-spread versions of the bird flu want to try such experiments again using a worrisome new strain. Since it broke out in China in March, the H7N9 bird flu has infected more than 130 people and killed 43. Leading flu researchers say that genetically engineering this virus in the lab could help track whether it?s changing in the wild to become a bigger threat.
