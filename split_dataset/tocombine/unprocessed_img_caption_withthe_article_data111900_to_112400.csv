She donned a red Givenchy gown -- the trend of the evening, apparently -- and a gorgeous red lip. We're seriously loving her look. What do you think?

8,BUSINESS,Legacy Wars: Steve Jobs vs. Bill Gates,"Adam Grant, ContributorWharton professor and author of GIVE AND TAKE and ORIGINALS",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/legacy-wars-steve-jobs-vs_b_5712387.html,"Not long ago, Malcolm Gladwell made a bold prediction: Fifty years from now, Apple will be around and Microsoft will be gone, but Bill Gates will be remembered -- and Steve Jobs won't. As surprising as it seems, Gladwell might be right.",2014-08-25,"Billionaire Bill Gates, chairman and founder of Microsoft Corp., speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2014. Gates, the world's richest man, said that by 2035 no nation will be as poor as any of the 35 that the World Bank now classifies as low-income, even adjusting for inflation. Photographer: Scott Eells/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3124c240000510055beb9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Not long ago, Malcolm Gladwell made a bold prediction. Fifty years from now, Apple will be around and Microsoft will be gone, but Bill Gates will be remembered -- and Steve Jobs won't.As surprising as it seems, Gladwell might be right. To investigate what shapes a legacy, researchers Scott Allison and Dafna Eylon led a series of studies. They found that when judging leaders, we care as much about their generosity as their accomplishments.In his time, Andrew Carnegie was best known as a steel tycoon; today, he is remembered more for building a university, a public library, and a music hall. In the same way, the Gates name won't stand for computers; it will symbolize advancing health, fighting poverty, improving education, and creating access to information technology in the developing world -- as well as motivating other billionaires to become philanthropists. Beyond what they achieve, leaders and entrepreneurs are remembered and revered for what they give.Many great entrepreneurs don't wait until they've succeeded to start giving back; they give right from the start. But for those who don't begin their careers as givers, there's still hope. Research shows that the motivation to help others tends to spike around midlife. By that point, we've accumulated the expertise, influence, and resources to feel that we can make a meaningful difference. It's also when we become especially concerned about future generations.Instead of paying back the people who have helped them, entrepreneurs dedicate their energy to paying it forward to those who aspire to follow in their footsteps. As network experts Wayne Baker and Nat Bulkley found in a new study, people ""pay it forward by using a simple rule: 'What has the group done for me'?"" When entrepreneurs are grateful for receiving help in the past, they help younger entrepreneurs by mentoring, making introductions, sharing ideas, and investing. Along with building a legacy, this transforms the communities around them.Consider Argentina, which is ranked 126 of the 189 countries in the World Bank's index that measures the ease of doing business. It's one of the hardest places on earth to start a company, deal with construction permits, register property, afford taxes, and trade across borders. Yet Buenos Aires is one of the most productive hubs of entrepreneurship on the planet, boasting a tech sector that may be the best in all of Spanish-speaking Latin America.To find out why, Linda Rottenberg, the cofounder and CEO of Endeavor, studied more than 200 entrepreneurs in Argentina. Her team asked tech entrepreneurs who inspired them, invested in them, and mentoring them, and mapped the network. Endeavor's director of insight, Rhett Morris, sums up the results: ""One of the drivers behind the growth of the tech sector in Buenos Aires was that successful entrepreneurs were paying it forward.""Here's the network map. Connections are lines; companies are bubbles: The larger the bubble, the greater the founder's contributions to entrepreneurship. ""What this graphic shows is that most of the companies trace their inspiration -- and in some cases their existence -- to a handful of more established companies,"" explains Rottenberg (whose forthcoming book, Crazy is a Compliment, is a terrific read on high-impact entrepreneurship). ""Fewer than 10 entrepreneurs helped spawn a community more than 20 times their size.""This is the stuff that legacies are made of. And it's why Bill Gates will be remembered: He has opened doors for many entrepreneurs and individuals to contribute to their own communities. If Jobs had lived longer, would he have given more? Maybe. Is it possible that he was already a philanthropist but did it anonymously? Maybe. With the limited window that he had, was inventing and perfecting new technologies a more important contribution than giving his time and money away? Maybe.When 1,000 Argentinian entrepreneurs identified the person who inspired them most, Bill Gates came in third. Steve Jobs was first. But research demonstrates a death positivity bias: Our evaluations of great leaders become more favorable when they're no longer alive. I'm willing to bet that over time, their positions will reverse."

Federer won 6-2, 6-3. (AP Photo/David Kohl)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb76b582600002d01834c03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With the U.S. Open set to begin Monday, it opens yet another chapter in one of the most compelling storylines of the tennis summer. That is, of course, the resurgence of Roger Federer to place himself once again among the top contenders in the sport. Exactly one year ago, Federer was in the midst of one of the toughest seasons and moments of his incredible career. He was out of the top four in men's tennis for the first time in years, as defending champion he had been eliminated in the second round of Wimbledon, his most beloved tournament, and he was coming off poor showings in his most recent tournament participations. Federer entered the 2013 U.S. Open hoping to erase the bad streak of early tournament exits that he had been suffering throughout that summer. He received, however, one of his most surprising defeats of the season, when he fell in the fourth round, dropping a straight-set decision against Spaniard Tommy Robredo, one match shy of a long-awaited meeting with Rafael Nadal in New York. One year later, Federer's outlook entering this fortnight could not be anymore different. This time around, the Swiss has had quite the busy summer in terms of match play. Federer is currently on a run of four straight finals, which include a classic five-setter which he dropped to Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon, a run to the finals in Toronto, and an unprecedented sixth trophy at the Western and Southern Open last Sunday, his first masters title since winning the same tournament in 2012. Federer will be seeded second behind Djokovic at the U.S. Open, due to Nadal's withdrawal, meaning that the earliest he could face the Serbian is in the final on Monday, September 8. If he wins the tournament, he will pass Nadal in the world rankings to be second only to Djokovic, given that Nadal will have dropped 4,000 points from skipping the masters events at Toronto and Cincinnati and the U.S. Open, all three tournaments which he won last year. One thing that is little known to those who do not follow tennis closely, however, is that if Federer were to beat anyone but Djokovic in the final, he would also move ahead in the Race to London Rankings. In essence, there are two types of tennis rankings. There's the Emirates ATP Rankings, which track the previous 52 weeks and are the official rankings, which are currently led by Djokovic, with Nadal coming in second and Federer in third, but there's also the Race to London rankings. The latter track the points obtained by the players in 2014 and serve to qualify players for the World Tour Finals in November. The reason these rankings are importance, besides their purpose as the meter for qualification to the WTF, is that these will mirror the Emirates ATP Rankings at the end of the season. One has to understand that to see how monumental a Federer victory in New York against anyone but Djokovic would be. Federer would move ahead to top those rankings and it would depend on him to top the year-end rankings for the sixth time. Even if it is Djokovic that he defeats in the finals, Federer would still have an opportunity to end the year at the top, especially considering that following the U.S. Open, the indoor hard-court season begins, and that is a period of the year in which Federer constantly excels. It would be good for the sport if Federer won the U.S. Open. For the first time in many years, the year-end race to see who ends the season at the top would not be composed of only two players, as it was in 2012 between Federer and Djokovic or last year between Djokovic and Nadal. This time around, there would be three athletes with a realistic shot at ending 2014 ranked No. 1 in the world. Djokovic currently leads the race, followed closely by Nadal and Federer. At some point in the next month or so, Nadal will return to the courts, and if he wins a few tournaments and has a strong showing in others, he could also make a case to end the season at the top. Then there's Federer, at age 33 he is battling time and critics alike, hoping to keep making history and building an already gigantic legacy. If Federer wins his sixth U.S. Open title, he will not only extend his record to 18 Grand Slam titles, but he will also break the tie with Pete Sampras and Jimmy Connors for the most U.S. Opens in the open era. It would also add even more spice, excitement, and drama to what has already been an incredible 2014 season, giving him a chance to match Sampras with six year-end No. 1 rankings."

""I may be hurting but my kid is doing great!""What about those who don't?The kids who struggle. Who get caught up in abusive relationships. Get into drugs. Who might go a year to college. Drop out. Or work jobs that are only part-time and sketchy at that. Have children that are unplanned or that they can't financially support.They are not mature enough or healthy enough to move into adult life responsibly.Real life ""failure to launch."" Not some movie version that Hollywood made kinda cute.There's nothing cute about it.Parents are left trying to decide how much to help. Whether or not to back away. They often blame themselves. Or go through a period of time where they deeply question what they could have done. Not done.It can be complicated.Early in children's lives, parents are pretty much in control. If you are good, decent folk, your kids get a good base. A solid foundation. An early psychological theorist, Winnicott, called it the ""good enough"" parent. (That phrase was always comforting to me somehow...).If you are not -- if you are an overly critical, withdrawn or abusive parent, your kid suffers. Horribly.(For the sake of this particular post, I will not discuss abused children. Those parents should obviously do everything they can to make amends for what they have created).At some point, things shift. The child takes on more and more responsibility for how they are coping in their world. They choose friends. They begin to define their interests. Their identities as individuals. Their world grows beyond parents and home.It usually all pans out. It's a normal process.We can't forget, however, the role of genetic predisposition. What your child inherits from his or her genetic makeup that will express itself through everything from the way they look to how their personality develops. For what kind of illnesses they may have susceptibility. What may be their strengths and their vulnerabilities, both physically and mentally.A child that may have done fairly well or very well while at home may falter out in the less structured, ""real"" world. Late teens and early twenties are the time when many emotional disorders begin to assert themselves. Anxiety or depression may evolve. If belief in themselves has been an issue, it will only become more difficult.Drugs are everywhere. Easy to obtain. Cool to do, in some circles. And a real killer of self.To watch your now legally adult child deteriorate? Struggle to find stability or even take responsibility? Be attracted to people who are doing the same? Not take care of children that you may love?Heartbreaking.I am not inferring that parents should not question whether or not they contributed to the problem. You may have. You may need to look at whether you are currently enabling that child's continued difficulty. I would recommend an honest discussion with your adult child about this topic. Maybe therapy.Perhaps some healing, some change could occur.Just don't take all the blame. Your child is now an adult.That ""child"" needs to look at themselves in the mirror. Honestly.I myself stayed in an abusive relationship far too long. And I was reared in a home where I received lots of loving messages.My dad told me that he just never gave up on me.My mother prayed a lot.When I finally figured out that there was another path, I took it.If you have an adult child who is struggling -- know that time can help. Keeping on loving them is essential. Looking for the good where you can find it. Just set the limits you need to.The rest is up to your child.

In less than three weeks, however, the Russian First Army and the Second Army of General Alexander Samsonov began to advance into East Prussia.",2014-08-24,2014-08-22-RussianprisonersandequipmentaftertheBattleofTannenberg.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-22-RussianprisonersandequipmentaftertheBattleofTannenberg-thumb.jpg,"Russian Prisoners and Equipment Captured at the Battle of TannenbergThe Eastern Front: Tannenberg & the Masurian LakesThe war on the Eastern Front began with the Austrian-Hungarian invasion of Serbia in July 1914. It would progressively grow to encompass a vast geography stretching from the Baltic Sea in the west to Minsk in the east, and from St. Petersburg in the north to the Balkans and the Black Sea in the south. This was a front of almost 1,000 miles. The absence of many natural defensive features and the relative low density of troops defending it, compared with the Western Front, created a far more fluid battlefield. Front lines were often broken, creating dramatic swings in the geography controlled by both sides. Trench warfare, the mainstay of the Western Front, was never developed to any great extent in the east.Tsar Nicholas II's Imperial Russian Army, once it had mobilized, was, on paper at least, a formidable foe. Operating under the command of the Tsar's cousin, Grand Duke Nicholas, it had at its disposal on the Eastern Front, 1.2 million men including 70 infantry and 24 cavalry divisions. It possessed an arsenal of almost 7,900 field guns, howitzers and heavy guns. The German General Staff's fear of the ""Russian Steam Roller"" was well placed.The Russian AdvanceThe German General Staff believed that it would take Russia a minimum of six weeks to mobilize its troops. In less than three weeks, however, the Russian First Army, commanded by General Pavel Rennenkampf, and the Second Army of General Alexander Samsonov began to advance into East Prussia. With most of the German forces deployed on the Western Front, they met weak opposition. Though there was little organized defense, the advance of the two armies was slowed by the hordes of German civilians fleeing westward in their path. Schlieffen had always anticipated the possibility of a rapid Russian advance, but this advance had started earlier and was more rapid than expected.To counter the Russian advance, General Paul von Hindenburg, hastily brought out of retirement, and General Erich Ludendorff, who had just secured Liège, were rushed to the Eastern Front. A complete corps of 25,000 men was detached from General Helmut Moltke's forces in the west and transferred by rail towards East Prussia. Two more corps would be dispatched to reinforce the Eastern Front, further reducing the strength of the German drive on Paris.The Russian First Army had reached Konigsberg, with the Second Army to its south, when, on August 22, the now reinforced German 8th Army encircled Samsonov at Tannenberg. The German commanders, bolstered by the belief that personal animosity between the two Russian generals would prevent them from reinforcing each other, planned to attack each of them in turn.Von Hindenburg and Ludendorff were right. Rennenkampf delayed until it was too late and, over seven days, Samsonov's army was systematically destroyed. Out of a force of 180,000 men, 60,000 were either killed or wounded, 100,000 were captured and only 10,000 escaped. No fewer than 60 trains were needed to transport captured Russian equipment back to Germany. The Battle of Tannenberg remains one of the most lopsided victories in the annals of warfare.Ludendorff and Hindenburg now turned their attention to Rennenkampf and the Russian First Army in the region of the Masurian Lakes. Reinforced with the addition of the Guards Reserve Corps and the XI Corps, the Germans now had a numerical advantage over the Russians. Hindenburg attempted to outflank the Russian First Army, but Rennenkampf was able to withdraw back towards the Russian border, and the protection of the border forts, with most of his army intact. The Battles of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes were a triumph for the German 8th Army. In the space of a month, it had destroyed the Russian Second Army, badly mauled the First Army and ejected all Russian troops from German soil. Those gains came at a price, however. The reinforcements had come at the expense of German forces in the west and their absence would be missed at the upcoming Battle of the Marne. Whether their presence there would have made a difference is a subject of endless debate among military historians.The Germans' success in the first major battles on the Eastern Front highlighted the incompetence of much of the Russian high command. The Russian army had a relatively tiny, trained officer corps and, unlike many other armies, an inexperienced cadre of NCOs. Soldiers were conscripted at the age of twenty for six years and served a further nine in the reserves. They received little training, however. More than 60 percent of their soldiers were illiterate.In addition, the country had, for its size, few railways and less than 5,000 miles of roads with hard surfaces. Even in good weather this could present a problem, but in the Russian winter, resupply and deployment could be incredibly slow. Though brave and tenacious, the Russian infantry often lacked adequate artillery support and was always desperately short of ammunition. In August of 1914 there were only two ambulances in the entire Russian army. Motorized transport was limited to 679 cars; most of which were reserved for the use of officers."

""When we went underwater we discovered that the boat is a lot bigger than we thought.""The boat sank late on Friday east of the capital Tripoli.

Many boats have been wrecked.The total number reaching Italian shores has passed 100,000 in 2014, the Italian government said this week.Libya is a major departure point for this journey, and human traffickers are exploiting the political chaos and lawlessness that has blighted the country since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in an uprising in 2011.Abdellatif said the coast guard had no resources for a rescue operation. ""Most of the bodies washed on the shores are still there because we don't have any resources to move them,"" he said. ""We contacted everyone, the health ministry and the Red Cross, but no one came to help.Libya is facing anarchy as the weak central government is unable to control armed groups who helped oust Gaddafi but now have turned their arms on themselves.Ministries in Tripoli have been mostly closed since fighting between two groups escalated last month as staff, trying to escape rockets and street gun battles, only show up sporadically for work.

14,WOMEN,Taylor Swift Reveals She Has Been A Feminist All This Time,Emily Thomas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taylor-swift-feminist-_n_5704691.html,,2014-08-24,"NEW YORK, NY - JULY 11: Taylor Swift with her mother Andrea Swift and father Scott Swift in New York, New York on July 11, 2014. Photo Credit: mpi67 / MediaPunch/IPX",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fc582600002d0182dcae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Internet has long wondered: Is T-Swift a feminist?And now, finally, the age-old debate can be put to bed. Yes, the “BFF to planet Earth,” as Swift was described by friend Tavi Gevinson, is of the feminist persuasion. In an interview with The Guardian published Friday, Swift discussed her recent come to Wollstonecraft moment. She says her awakening was due, in part, to her friendship with Lena Dunham, who is known for being an outspoken feminist on social media. Swift told The Guardian:“As a teenager, I didn’t understand that saying you’re a feminist is just saying that you hope women and men will have equal rights and equal opportunities. What it seemed to me, the way it was phrased in culture, society, was that you hate men. And now, I think a lot of girls have had a feminist awakening because they understand what the word means. For so long it’s been made to seem like something where you’d picket against the opposite sex, whereas it’s not about that at all. Becoming friends with Lena – without her preaching to me, but just seeing why she believes what she believes, why she says what she says, why she stands for what she stands for – has made me realize that I’ve been taking afeminist stance without actually saying so.”Swift has previously skirted around labeling herself a feminist, but now we know that's probably because she wasn't so clear on what it really means to be a feminist. When asked by The Daily Beast's Ramin Setoodeh in 2012 if she considers herself a feminist, Swift, then 22, replied: ""I don’t really think about things as guys versus girls. I never have. I was raised by parents who brought me up to think if you work as hard as guys, you can go far in life.""Her past attempts to distance herself from that designation upset writers like The Frisky's Jessica Wakeman, who wrote of Swift in 2012: ""[S]he’s 22 now and has been exposed to a lot in these past few years. I do not expect that Taylor Swift would have the politics of Kathleen Hanna, India.Arie, Ani DiFranco or even Alanis Morrissette. But I do wish she could correctly identify what a feminist is — even if she does not want to identify as one.""Swift's avoidance of feminism even inspired the popular parody Twitter account @FeministTaylorSwift. Now it seems Swift has grown up and gotten a proper schooling in feminism along the way. Swift, welcome to the club."
