Ruth Wilson, who plays with me",2013-11-10,"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - NOVEMBER 09: Actor Idris Elba attends the 2013 BAFTA LA Jaguar Britannia Awards presented by BBC America at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on November 9, 2013 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/BAFTA LA/Getty Images for BAFTA LA)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badf4082000003000ff29a2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Among today’s talented crop of actors, many don’t have the prestige to boast about their unique connection to both America’s first black president, Barack Obama, and also South Africa’s first black president, Nelson Mandela. But if you’re Idris Elba, such bragging rights come with the territory as one of Hollywood’s leading black actors. Later this month, the Golden Globe Award-winner will star as the famed South African leader in his highly-anticipated biopic, “Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.” The Weinstein Company release will top another successful year for the 41-year-old, who also took on the lead role in Toyota’s latest spy-themed advertising campaign, “Only the Name Remains,” and starred in the recently concluded season of BBC’s popular crime drama series, “Luther.”  And though he’s reluctant to address recent rumors regarding his love life, the transcontinental heart throb opened up to The Huffington Post about his latest roles, in addition to an update on his health. How did you get involved with Toyota’s “Only the Name Remains” campaign?That campaign was a very successful fruit of a relationship between myself and an advertising agency called Burrell. I’ve had a relationship with them and we’ve been trying to find the right sort of thing to do and this Toyota opportunity came by. They know I like cars and they knew that it would be a good fit for me in a campaign like that. So we sat down and talked about what the ideas were and before you know it we had this really great director that came on board and fleshed out the vision for it and the rest is history.Were you inspired by any spy characters to portray the role?No, not really. The inspiration was making the car look good and making the characters believable. That was the inspiration. I think the director’s inspiration was obviously the great spy movies, from “James Bond” to “Bourne,” all these films that have this sort of character. For me, I love to drive and some of those stunt sequences I did myself. So I was really excited to have that opportunity. It’s ironic that you’re portraying a spy throughout the campaign, because it’s been rumored that you may very well go on to become the first black James Bond. Are there any updates on the role?There’s no truth to that at all, brother. It’s a massive rumor. But, I don’t think that was intentional from my behalf, the whole spy, James Bond thing. The script and the storyline in the commercial was just so well presented that I wasn’t thinking about that rumor. How did it feel to have President Obama host you at the White House for your Mandela screening?I mean really, that was a great feeling. That was such a great moment for me to have the opportunity to present that film to the president. The president has oftentimes spoke very, very highly of Mr. Mandela and regards him as a friend and speaks of him fondly. So I felt very proud to play the character and be able to present it to Barack, who loves to watch films. And he has said to me in the past, “You’re one of my favorite actors.” Which is a great, great compliment. Also, the fact that both of these men are so unique. Mr. Mandela was the first black president in South Africa and Obama being the first black president here, and somehow Idris Elba is connected between these two men. And that really does fill me with a lot of pride. Among your various experiences screening the film in different countries, did you notice any differences between the reactions of theatergoers?In Toronto, which is a filmmakers crowd, they received it very well. Some of the critics were more impressed with the acting than the story, and some were the other way around. In South Africa, the screening was taken very well, very emotional. Very revered, because it’s such a big story. And I think it’s an added plus that it’s a South African-made film, so they were very, very proud of it. I had trepidation showing the film in South Africa. I wanted them to really like it and they did. I got very huge compliments from people who were actually there and went through the liberation struggle. Last weekend while en route to the South Africa premiere, it was reported that you were rushed to the hospital due to an asthma attack. How are you feeling?I’m feeling really good. Full recovery ... I’ve battled with asthma most of my life, and I think as soon as I got on that plane I just got an attack, which is really rare. And the attack got bad really quickly. So it was a weird and very scary moment for me. But thank God that I’m well and OK. And I’m good. Looking ahead to the future, have you started preparing for the “Luther” movie prequel?It’s one of these projects that is very close to my heart. But because it’s so close to my heart, we’re taking our time with it. Neil Cross, the writer, is slowly prepping the spine of the story. And hopefully in 2014 he and I will sit down and start to flesh out what will happen throughout the film. I’m super excited about that, man. I feel that the audience that has followed “Luther” deserve for it to grow into something that is a film. I think the characters in the story will really transfer well to a film. So it’s a matter of time. I’m just hoping that in 2014 I can sort of realize that. In terms of female co-stars throughout your career, who would you consider to be your favorite to work with?Wow, that’s a great question … Well, in terms of talent I’ve worked with very great actors. Ruth Wilson, who plays with me in “Luther” is amazing. Naomie Harris just completely blew my socks off. I’ve worked with an actress in London called Nadine Marshall on an independent film. She’s an incredible actress and I can’t wait for the world to see her. I’m very blessed in terms of working with great actors, but I would say those are my top three that I’ve worked with recently that blew me away. "

The maker of Sriracha hot sauce is under fire for allegedly fouling the air around its Southern California production site. The city of Irwindale filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday asking a judge to stop production at the Huy Fong Foods factory, claiming the chili odor emanating from the facility is a public nuisance. (AP Photo/Nick Ut)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3021626000035008200f8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The founder of the red rooster hot sauce is seeing red.David Tran, CEO of Sriracha-maker Huy Fong Foods, said his company could have lost up to $10 million and faced bankruptcy if a judge had granted the shutdown of the factory that makes the much-loved sauce, according to a statement he provided to The Los Angeles Times. Huy Fong Foods is engaged in an ongoing legal battle with the city of Irwindale, Calif., where its Sriracha factory is located. Last month, a judge denied a request by the city to halt the company's operations after residents complained that fumes resulting from the processing of chilies were causing headaches and burning eyes.Tran issued a statement to the Los Angeles Times ahead of a Nov. 22 hearing about the city's request for an injunction. Despite a mollifying approach to the complaints so far, Tran's recent response to the Times was more concerned:""Suppose if the city chose never to issue another business license to the company? Who would be left to run this company's operations? The city of Irwindale?"" Tran wrote in a statement to the LAT, adding that the city had acted ""severely toward us without conducting a real investigation.""For more on Tran's relationship with the city of Irwindale, click over to the LAT.The city of Irwindale, however, says Huy Fong Foods has been given plenty of warning since complaints about the odor first started in September.""I don't think anyone can argue with any credibility that the smell is not there,"" Irwindale city attorney Fred Galante told The Huffington Post over the phone, adding that the smell had been verified by a local air quality official. ""I'm not sure why [Tran] believes an investigation is warranted when we have over 30 witnesses that are suffering from this odor. It's hard to see how we're being unfair.""Huy Fong Foods would be hit especially hard should operations be halted at this time of year. The company processes a year's supply of Sriracha chilies -- about 100 million pounds -- between September and December. Since chilies must be processed the same day they're harvested, any delays could force the company to leave chilies to rot unharvested, according to the Los Angeles Times.Sriracha brought in $60 million in revenue last year according to Tran, and since news broke of a potential factory shutdown, demand for the sauce has been hotter than ever. Fearing a shortage, super-fans have reportedly taken to stockpiling the sauce, while a Philadelphia city council member personally wrote Huy Fong Foods inviting it to move its factory to the City of Brotherly Love, ABCNews reports.Update: Huy Fong Foods provided the following statement to HuffPost:""Huy Fong Foods is grateful with yesterday's ruling denying the preliminary restraining order sought by the City of Irwindale. The Company has worked with the City and other governmental agencies in this matter and will continue to do so. The Company has taken recent steps to enhance its filtration system and is continuing to be proactive and monitor the situation. Huy Fong Foods is proud to be a member of the Irwindale community, and growing with it. Huy Fong would also like to sincerely thank all its supporters especially during this period."""
2,BUSINESS,Early Obamacare Data To Signal How Many Americans Are Still Waiting To Enroll,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-data-still-waiting-enroll_us_5bb30218e4b0480ca6612edd,"A small sign-up number, particularly one dominated by Medicaid enrollment, would be seized upon by Republican critics as",2013-11-10,"WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 04: US President Barack Obama delivers remarks at an Organizing for Action 'Obamacare Summit' at the St. Regis Hotel on November 4, 2013 in Washington, D.C.

(Photo by Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30218240000500055ba15.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By David MorganWASHINGTON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The Obama administration will release healthcare enrollment numbers for Obamacare's rocky October rollout this week that could be more important for what they fail to say, than for what they do.President Barack Obama's Democratic administration, which is under intense pressure from Republicans to release the data, has signaled that the total will be low after weeks of technical problems with the federal website, HealthCare.gov.But that will only underscore the huge number of people believed to be waiting for a chance to obtain benefits, according to policy experts and congressional aides.The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, aims to provide health benefits to millions of uninsured Americans. It mandates that most Americans at least be enrolled for health insurance by March 31 or pay a fine.Analysts say the October number should offer an early indication of whether Obama's landmark health initiative is proving more popular with poor people who qualify for Medicaid or with working-class families eligible for subsidized private insurance through new online marketplaces that have been set up in all 50 states.U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told the Senate Finance Committee last week that the early tally would be ""very low,"" and that the data would break out the numbers for states and show how many enrolled in private insurance plans versus expanded Medicaid programs.But administration officials have not said whether the data will provide clues to other important questions, including whether young healthy adults, needed by insurers to offset older people with higher health costs, are eager to obtain coverage.A small sign-up number, particularly one dominated by Medicaid enrollment, would be seized upon by Republican critics as evidence that the law is a failure that must be delayed or overhauled before it leads to wider problems within the $2.9 trillion U.S. healthcare system.The administration is racing to make the federal enrollment website HealthCare.gov work smoothly by the end of November.""There's going to be a huge crunch. It's a big choke point. The risk is people having lapses in coverage because the system can't handle the volume, which would be a huge political problem for the administration,"" said James Capretta of the conservative Ethics & Public Policy Center.Prior to the launch troubles, as many as 7 million Americans were expected to sign up for private health insurance offered through the online marketplaces for 2014. An additional 9 million were expected to enroll in an expanded Medicaid program for the poor by March 31, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Before the Oct. 1 website launch became a debacle, internal administration memos anticipated 494,620 enrollees in October and 706,000 in November nationwide, according to congressional investigators. Administration officials declined to confirm the numbers, saying projections are subject to rapid change.A failure to fix the website that leaves large numbers of people uninsured could put tremendous pressure on the administration to delay implementation, including the individual mandate that requires most Americans to have insurance in 2014 or face a penalty.Administration official have not said exactly when this week the data will be released.Republican aides in the U.S. House of Representatives believe the Department of Health and Human Services and its Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will try to avoid scrutiny by not providing detailed data.""They could give us very granular data showing enrollment by state, by plan level, how many enrollees had subsidies and at what level - all that stuff. But I think they're going to give us something aggregated nationally,"" said one aide.So far, the administration has only said that 750,000 people have applied to determine their eligibility for Medicaid or for tax credits under the healthcare law.A Reuters tally of 7 states that are running their own exchanges and providing detailed information on enrollment shows more than 35,000 Americans have picked a private insurance plan so far. More than 145,000 have enrolled in Medicaid. (Additional reporting by Caroline Humer and Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Tim Dobbyn)"

A U.N. scientific panel says cyclones may become more intense in some regions by 2100 as the planet warms.Global average temperatures have risen by 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution and are set to exceed 2C - a target ceiling agreed at a previous U.N. summit - on current trends, despite a hiatus in the pace of warming so far this century.In September, the U.N. panel of climate experts raised the probability that mankind is the main cause of recent warming to 95 percent or ""extremely likely"" from 90 percent ""very likely"".The World Meteorological Organisation said this month atmospheric volumes of greenhouse gases reached a new record in 2012, driven up by growth in emerging economies led by China. $100 BILLION AIDDeveloped nations are putting most emphasis on spurring economic growth after the financial crisis, rather than making big investments in renewable energies such as wind or solar power. Economic slowdown has - at least temporarily - cut greenhouse gas emissions in many nations.The U.S. shale boom helped push U.S. carbon emissions to an 18-year low last year, but also shifted cheap, polluting coal into Europe where it is used in power stations.Many governments, especially in Europe, are concerned climate policies, such as generous support for renewables, push up energy bills for consumers, a major political issue in countries such as Britain.The Warsaw meeting will also seek ways to raise aid to help developing nations cope with climate change. They have been promised $100 billion a year by 2020, from $10 billion a year from 2010-12.On Monday, aid charity Oxfam estimated that climate aid totalled between $7.6 billion and $16.3 billion in 2013, but said ""murky accounting and a lack of transparency by rich countries"" made it hard to know.Christiana Figueres, the U.N. climate chief, said Warsaw was a ""pivotal moment"" when it was still possible to limit rising temperatures to 2C above pre-industrial times. ""Global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak this decade,"" she said.Hosts Poland said a climate deal should allow countries to define their own emissions targets - from power plants, factories and cars - rather than try to impose them in a global diktat.""We need flexibility between the countries, that they will promote their own strategies, their own goals,"" Environment Minister Marcin Korolec said.Poland uses coal to generate 90 percent of its electricity and has upset some delegates by planning a ""world coal summit"" about how to cut emissions from coal during the climate talks.Environmental group Greenpeace projected messages on six Polish coal-fired power plants on Sunday saying: ""Climate change starts here!"" and ""Storms start here!"".

(AP) -- A top U.S. Agriculture Department official praised a South Carolina pilot program Thursday and said it could be a model for keeping millions of acres of Southern forests in the hands of black landowners.""I would hope that this could be replicated throughout the country,"" said Joe Leonard Jr., the assistant secretary of agriculture for civil rights, who visited rural Ridgeville to learn what the nonprofit Center for Heirs' Property Preservation is doing to help black landowners manage their forest land and realize value from it.For almost a decade, the center has worked to clear titles on heirs' property - land generally deeded to blacks following the Civil War and passed down without benefit of wills. Much of it is now owned in common by sometimes dozens of heirs. Often, one descendant can demand their value and force a sale for the proceeds, at which time the land often passes out of the family.Earlier this year the center and the Roanoke Electrical Cooperative-Roanoke Center in Ahoskie, N.C. began a pilot project to help preserve black-owned forests. It was financed in part by a $1.2 million grant from the U.S. Endowment for Forestry and Communities and agencies of Agriculture Department. The object is to help blacks realize income from their forest land through timbering, forest products and hunting rights.""If we can help families earn money while clearing title to their land, we're going to help a lot of African-American families in the South,"" said Jennie Stephens, executive director of the center. She estimated there is at least 41,000 acres of heirs' property in the six South Carolina counties that the center serves.According to the U.S. Forest Service, about 229 million acres of southern forest is owned privately, about 16 million of that by blacks and other minorities.Sam Cook, the sustainable forestry director for the center, said the agency has identified 130 landowners with about 5,000 acres interested in working on developing management plans for their forests.He said there's already a success story. One landowner had planned to sell 22 acres of his land to help pay his mortgage. But after working with the center, he took the land off the market and will raise the money through timbering.---On the Internet:Center for Heirs' Property Preservation:HTTP://WWW.HEIRSPROPERTY.ORG "
