0,QUEER VOICES,The Danger Of Blaming National Tragedies On The Gay Community,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gay-dad-robi-ludwig-_n_5462068.html,,2014-06-07,"Photos, candles, signs, and other mementos are placed at a makeshift memorial in front of IV Deli Mart, where Christopher Michaels-Martinez was slain in a massacre in Isla Vista, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafc8d71f0000390123197c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Rob Watson | The Next Family As a dad, when I see news stories of young people and children being killed, my heart breaks wide open. If such an event were to happen to either of my sons, I in all honesty, do not think I have what it would take to recover from such a loss.Last week in Santa Barbara, Calif., six sets of parents faced that situation in their lives. A seventh set, the parents of Elliot Rodger, 22, who allegedly killed the other six before killing himself, have a whole other layer of horror in front of them.One of the strangest cornerstones of life in new millennium media is not the question on whether someone will blame a current tragedy on the LGBT community, it is how quickly they will run to do it. From 9/11, to earthquakes, to floods and British rain, it is LGBT caused, according to these factions.The Isla Vista killings were no different. Within days, Ken Blackwell of the Family Research Counsel presented the through-line that held LGBT couples and their marriages accountable: gay marriage had destroyed society, it had confused the sexuality of the deranged, and it had inspired them to kill. It is a very warped hypothesis considering it requires a complete lapse of logic, a detachment from reality and a good deal of psychic ability to reach any level of outside plausibility. In short, it does not really give explanation to the tragedy, but more gives deep insight to the depths of Blackwell’s anti-gay obsession.Anti-gay obsession does not explain the commentary by pop psychologist Dr. Robi Ludwig, however. On Fox News, the doctor was asked to “hypothesize several factors which could have triggered #elliotrodgers spree killing.” Her stated hypothesis was:“When I was first listening to him, I was like, ‘Oh, he’s angry with women for rejecting him. And then I started to have a different idea: Is this somebody who is trying to fight against his homosexual impulses? Was he angry with women because they were taking away men from him? But this is a kid who couldn’t connect, and felt enraged, and wanted to obliterate anyone that made him feel like a nothing. That’s what this guy felt like, a nothing. A nothing on the one hand, and then there was a grandiosity, on the other hand where he is talking about how beautiful he is, how sophisticated he is, but clearly a very problematic guy… and I think too, was he angry at the men for not choosing him? This was a kid who was just angry in general and probably felt rejected, he could not connect, he couldn’t feel loved, he could not feel successful, maybe he could not even feel like a real man.”Ludwig’s opinion does not seem to be reflected in Elliot Rodger’s own statements of the killings. In those, he is very specific about his sexual attraction towards women and his jealousy towards the men he sees as his rivals. “On the day of retribution, I am going to enter the hottest sorority house at UCSB and I will slaughter every single spoiled, stuck-up, blond slut I see inside there. All those girls I’ve desired so much. They have all rejected me and looked down on me as an inferior man if I ever made a sexual advance toward them, while they throw themselves at these obnoxious brutes. I take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you…After I have annihilated every single girl in the sorority house, I’ll take to the streets of Isla Vista and slay every single person I see there. All those popular kids who live such lives of hedonistic pleasure while I’ve had to rot in loneliness all these years. They all look down upon me every time I tried to join them, they’ve all treated me like a mouse.”I am not a psychologist, but the attitude I see in the demented Rodgers was not one of suppressed homosexuality, but of the rape culture and sexual entitlement expectation that I have observed in a few heterosexual men. One such man remarked to me in the past about a woman who had turned down his advances in a bar, “She was sitting there rejecting me and all I could think of was, crap bitch, don’t you realize that I am strong enough to reach up and squash your head like a grape? How dare you say no to me…”For those in the LGBT community, the Ludwig’s words did not sound like psych analysis. They rang instead of “blame the gays.” Popular lgbt columnist and editor John Becker described the commentary as “appalling and shameful” and Ludwig’s thought process as “mental gymnastics.”Ludwig offered up a social media apology and asserted that she was “misunderstood.” She stated, “I in NO way meant to indicate being homosexual or having homosexual impulses is a cause for spree killing. My job @judgejeanine was to assess several POSSIBLE triggers for #ElliotRodgers behavior. #peace #forequalrights.”As a dad, I see Dr. Ludwig’s comments not only as mis-spoken, unfortunate and misguided. I see them as dangerous. Here is why, in my open letter to her:Dear Dr. Ludwig,Rob Watson is a writer for The Next Family and Evol Equals. He lives in Santa Cruz with his family.

What kinds of initiatives are your child's school currently implementing? These are important questions for parents before they head into the mobile device market."" -- Carl HookerWhich digital device is the better learning tool for students - a Chromebook or an iPad? If you're not aware of the hottest current digital device debate, you're probably not a parent or an educator. Once upon a time, that debate might have been about VHS vs. Beta, or Mac vs. PC. However, in prime time ed tech school district circles, folks are fiercely focused on Chromebooks vs. iPads (both now below $400). The big question? Which is the smarter purchase for their students? On the flip side of the classroom debate, Mom and Dad might not like the fact that portable digital tools are becoming more and more invasive. However, how's a parent to ignore these must-have lightweight mobile monsters, which are antiquating the family desktop and nurturing independence? Not to mention all your kids' friends seem to have one. So which digital device is best?  ""A double-barreled approach of age appropriate restrictions coupled with constant conversation with your kids are more effective measures for preventing your kids from getting into trouble on the web."" -- Carl HookerTime to check in with one of my favorite experts. Carl Hooker is Director of Innovation and Digital Learning, Eanes, Texas Independent School District (ISD), one of the largest and most successful 1:1 districts in the country, and Tech&Learning Leader of the Year. Carl has these important tips for parents and educators:5 Tips for Parents:1. Check with your school.What are the learning needs of your child? What kinds of initiatives are your child's school currently implementing? These are important questions for parents before they head into the mobile device market. Some schools are a part of ""GAFE"" (Google Apps For Education) and others may be embarking on some sort of iOS one-to-one initiative. Before you make a purchase, check with your child's school to see if there are any suggestions that would help parallel the learning taking place in the classroom. This will make your job easier as a parent when it comes to training, and will provide your child with an advantage in the classroom.  2. Restrictions can be your friend (and enemy).Both iPads and Chromebooks have some ability to limit what your kids are doing on these devices. Chrome OS allows parents to put a ""Supervised User"" on the device to enforce SafeSearch and monitor web traffic. iOS lets parents place age-appropriate restrictions, white-list certain websites, and even lock down the device to a certain app (called ""Guided Access"" mode). All that being said, these restrictions and filters are good only if you don't let them lull you into a false sense of security. A double-barreled approach of age appropriate restrictions coupled with constant conversation with your kids are more effective measures for preventing your kids from getting into trouble on the web.3. Wireless isn't everywhere...yet.If you live in an area with limited wireless access, you'll want to consider that when purchasing your child's device. Both Chromebooks and iPads have powerful web uses, but in terms of offline usability, the iPad has a bit of an advantage with its bevy of local native apps. Even though Chromebooks are increasing their amount of offline apps, the device is still largely web-dependent. You should be aware of your wireless situation when purchasing one of these devices for your child. ""If educators are focused on control first, they are missing the bigger picture of teaching kids to learn self-control."" -- Carl Hooker4. Life is about teachable moments.With a device in his hands, your child now has access to everything in the world, both good and bad. Like when you were a kid, they will make mistakes. Your gut reaction will be to take away the device when something goes awry. Avoid doing that if at all possible. The device is just a conduit to a poor choice or bad decision. Taking away the device does two things. For one, it means you only fixed the conduit (temporarily) but didn't address the actual behavior. The other reason this isn't advisable is that you are trying to gain trust and increase communication with your child. By taking away the device after that first mistake of for example, chatting rudely online, your child won't be so apt to share when something inappropriate happens in the future for fear of the technology being taken away. 5. Don't take the easy way out.Keeping devices out of the hands of your kids, locking them away, turning off the internet and generally ""avoiding the problem"" with technology is much easier to do as a parent. It means you don't have to deal with online privacy concerns, social media posting, crazy selfies, and cyberbullying. While it sounds all well and good to shelter your child from the world, the truth of the matter is you aren't doing your kid any favors by taking the easy way out. Rather than avoiding the problem, embrace it. Take the opportunity to set limits with your child when you purchase their first iPad, Chromebook or any other device. Make it an open dialogue and know that while they may have the tech know-how, you hold the experiences of life. 5 Tips for Educators:  1. It's not about the device.The device choice is irrelevant if educators don't apply certain changes to their learning environment and instruction. Sure, the iPad does video projects and visual arts better, and the Chromebook is better for collaboration and writing, but each is capable of doing what the other does. It just looks different. You have to have buy-in and belief that every kid having their own device is a value-add. Without that, debating the choice of device is misguided energy.2. Don't make it all about control.Some educators shudder at the thought of every single student in their class having anytime access to the world at his fingertips. Companies are making fortunes creating ways for teachers and IT departments to control these devices. While there needs to be some level of oversight and age-appropriate restrictions, you should never choose a device based on how well you can control it. If educators are focused on control first, they are missing the bigger picture of teaching kids to learn self-control. ""Without a shift in pedagogical practice, the device and space is rendered nothing more than a substitutive tool in nature. If the learning environment is still teacher-centered and lecture-based, having iPads and Chromebooks can in fact be a great distraction for the teacher."" -- Carl Hooker3. Focus on the learning objective.In an ideal world, your students would have access to multiple devices based on the learning objective. As crazy as that sounds, most adults seem to have a two-device minimum on their persons. While a two or three-to-one device ratio would be great, the reality is students just need access to a variety of tools based on needs. The good news is with the variety of apps and web resources, students just need access to those tools. Chromebooks and iPads provide a relatively inexpensive way to have that access.4. Rethink your space.In the ""traditional-modern"" version of the classroom, desks appear in rows or possibly sets of tables. If there are computers, they are usually in the back of the room, against the wall in a station type set up. Getting access to technology for all students in this type of environment usually involves a weekly trip to the computer lab for 45 minutes. However, with ubiquitous access to mobile devices, there no longer is the need for that. Along with that shift, schools need to look inward at how flexible the learning environment is in classrooms. Now, with everything truly mobile, why would you confine your students to a static space? Much like the device need, the space where your students learn should be as dynamic as the access they now have at their fingertips. 5. Pedagogy is everything.Increased access to mobile devices and flexible spaces are great tools for creating a dynamic learning environment for your students. However, without a shift in pedagogical practice, the device and space are rendered nothing more than substitutive tools in nature. If the learning environment is still teacher-centered and lecture-based, having iPads and Chromebooks can in fact be a great distraction for the teacher. An active, student-centered approach where the focus is on content creation versus content consumption is the more effective way to utilize these devices. Not only does that shift take the ""need for control"" aspect out of teaching, it also empowers the student to take control of his/her own learning. An environment that encourages collaboration, problem-solving, and communication means students are applying their learning in a much more powerful way. This is not a new approach by any means, but having iPads or Chromebooks in your class makes it much more possible. For more information on Carl Hooker  C. M.

2,RELIGION,Pope Francis Is A Total Workaholic,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-francis-holiday-tired-rest_n_5462288.html,,2014-06-07,"Pope Francis delivers his speech during a meeting with faithful at Rome's Olympic Stadium, Sunday, June 1, 2014. Pope Francis has led a pep rally to boost faith at Rome's soccer stadium, packed with more than 50,000 Catholics who follow charismatic movements. (AP Photo/Riccardo De Luca)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e7fd2600003001836fa8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON (RNS) Pope Francis has been working nonstop since his election more than a year ago, and he has shown remarkable resilience for a 77-year-old confronted with an array of church crises. But he is also fatigued at times and his advisers are hoping that he will take a break this summer.“We have been asking him to have holidays this year,” Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras told reporters during a visit to Washington this week. “Because last year he didn’t and sometimes he’s very tired.”“So I think that during August he’s going to retire to rest,” said Maradiaga, who heads a kitchen cabinet of eight cardinals from around the world that Francis established as his top advisers.Where the pope might go on vacation is unclear. Popes in the past have always moved to the papal villa at Castel Gandolfo in the hills outside Rome during the hot summer months. St. John Paul II and Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI also went to the mountains of northern Italy for a week or two.But last summer, his first as pontiff, Francis did not take a break and did not even decamp to Castel Gandolfo, a move church officials said was part of his desire to downplay the trappings of the papacy and to save money.Maradiaga also ruled out the idea that Francis would vacation in his native Argentina. “Not now, because (Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de) Kirchner wants to use this for her propaganda.”Papal aides say that Francis “eats work,” thriving off the hectic pace, despite the fact that he had part of a lung removed in his 20s and wears orthopedic shoes to help alleviate chronic lower back pain. He is conscious of his limitations, they say, and has occasionally canceled events if he is feeling tired or ill.But Francis also has a tendency to micromanage and he has a lengthy to-do list, from reforming the scandal-plagued Roman Curia to addressing the clergy sex abuse crisis. He also has to fend off conservatives who are resisting his efforts to make the Catholic Church less bound to old customs and more open and flexible in its approach.“I have even heard people say ‘We are praying for him (Francis) to die as soon as possible,’” Maradiaga said earlier this year of Francis’ opponents.Even as Francis’ friends and allies pray for his health and push him to conserve his energy, some conservatives who have been nonplussed by the pope’s reform efforts have highlighted speculation about his durability.A story at the conservative website Newsmax on the eve of Francis’ three-day trip to the Holy Land last month claimed the pontiff has gained weight since his election and is having difficulty breathing. The article suggested that Francis “may be slipping into a form of chronic heart failure.”That isn’t a scenario the Catholic right would necessarily welcome.“What worries me is that if Pope Francis suddenly collapses and dies the stupid conspiracy rumor mill will immediately kick in and we will have a whole new round of accusations about how the pope was bumped off by those sinister conservatives,” the Rev. Dwight Longenecker, a South Carolina priest and frequent critic of Francis, wrote on his blog at Patheos.com. "

She talks in circles and seems to have built up a protective wall around herself that almost emanates trashy talk show cliches (""You don't know me!"").The book has been touted by its publisher, Ellora’s Cave, as based on Abraham's experiences in the adult industry. Abraham , however, is quick to claim the similarities between her and Fallon end there.""Yes, I had a sex tape, the book talks about sex tapes, but Fallon Opal is way different. The story is way different,"" she explained in a recent interview with The Huffington Post. Abraham said Opal is ""way different"" than herself because the character doesn't have a child and didn't start out as a reality star. Except she did: Fallon gets her start on reality television, a fact Abraham has seemingly forgotten about.Discrepancies like that might make it hard for some to believe that Abraham possesses the talent and creativity necessary to even craft a story that wasn't just a page ripped out of her own diary (with some names changed for legal reasons). She says otherwise. She's also of the opinion that the full-length, X-rated movie released by Vivid Entertainment isn't your regular run-of-the-mill porn movie. The crux of the disparity, it seems, is in how she defines a ""celebrity sex tape"" and a commercial pornographic video.""I think people purposely don't know how to separate what a celebrity sex tape is and a regular porn. I mean, I have wonderful friends who are in the adult industry, they make porn for a living. That's what they always do. Like, payment is different. Like, living your life is different. Taking care of yourself. Everything is different,"" she explained. What's more, Abraham said with a traditional porn movie, ""many people won't ever see it, they won't ever know about it. But, for a celebrity sex tape, as we all are aware of, millions of people will watch it and you get way more [backlash]. And you are more known for it. And there is just a more compelling something.""She continued: ""A celebrity sex tape to me, outshines any other porn star, and any other person who makes porn. Lots of my friends make sex tapes. They can't say, 'Oh my God, I made a celebrity sex tape,' and nobody even knows about it. So there's a huge difference. And that's just what society made of it. It's not me, I don't make these definitions, it's just obvious.""Or not really: More people would likely be inclined to agree that true sex tapes were filmed in an amateur way and were not initially created for public distribution. Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian's video-taped dalliances were filmed as private moments in their personal lives well in advance of them ever being even a blip on the public's radar. What ended up being released in 2004 as ""1 Night In Paris,"" was filmed in 2001; ""Kim Kardashian, Superstar"" was shot a full three years prior to when it leaked -- back when she was still organizing closets for the likes of Hilton. Both of these women claim their tapes were released without their permission, and while that has been contested, it's obvious their tapes were at, one point, meant solely for personal use. That's what's missing from Abraham's ""Farrah Superstar, Backdoor Teen Mom."" Abraham's X-rated footage gives off the impression that it was shot by professionals for public consumption. Her co-star is James Deen, the hottest professional male porn star in the adult entertainment industry. (Deen, by the way, went on record to say that he was hired to have sex with Abraham on camera, and that he never agreed to play along with the idea that they were ever dating. In his words, they shot a ""porno."")When asked how she began her alleged relationship with Deen, she declined to answer. ""I'm not going to be talking about certain people."" And whether she's still in touch with him? ""I personally don't [speak to him] because of some of the comments he's made to the press that weren't true,"" she said. Abraham has never explained how she and Deen met, but she still maintains that she was in a relationship with the actor when they shot their explicit video. ""I personally was [in the relationship],"" she explained. ""I can only say what I personally am, and what I was under the belief of. I can't really vouch for anyone else or anything.""Beyond the sex tape/porn video, Abraham is full of other contradictions, too. She rejects the label of porn star, yet she has fully embraced all of the businesses that supplement the incomes of adult entertainers, including her own sex toy line, appearances at strip clubs and porn conventions, and now her own erotic trilogy. When asked if she realizes that these projects don't help distance her from such a label, she said, ""I'll just let people think what they would like to think and that's fine, because it really doesn't infringe upon my life. I just know I don't go around and have sex and make more movies."" While the former MTV reality star hasn't made any more adult films beyond her romp with Deen (a second video consisting of footage from the same shoot was also released following the success of ""Backdoor Teen Mom""), she has promoted them. And claimed that she was raped while doing so. Abraham told In Touch that she was ""drugged and raped more than once,"" at gigs she booked to promote the tape. Abraham has since received a cease and desist letter from Vivid regarding her confidentiality agreement and her claims that she was sexually assaulted. When asked about the assault, Abraham said, ""I mean I personally would not name names and other things I had to deal with after that article came out I probably shouldn't be talking about it. But, like, there's a lot of that. That goes on in clubs and a lot of celebrities deal with things like that. And that's really sad.""Up next for Abraham following the release of her erotic trilogy, a Christian parenting book. "

Nasrallah said that the Syrian regime and the 'resistance axis' including his Lebanese Shiite militant movement would triumph in Syria's conflict. AFP PHOTO/MAHMOUD ZAYYAT (Photo credit should read MAHMOUD ZAYYAT/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc137e52400004f0024e528.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIRUT - Hezbollah is changing the shape of the war in Syria - but the war is also changing Hezbollah, with potentially far-reaching results.Hezbollah's intervention in Syria has achieved significant gains: it has provided the Syrian regime momentum, averting its military defeat; dislodged rebels from areas adjacent to the borders; stopped further outrages against Shiites; and prevented a detrimental recalibration of the regional balance of power. From Hezbollah's perspective, its intervention became a strategic necessity as the initial Syrian uprising morphed into a zero-sum regional war. It has come to see the potential loss of its Damascus ally as an existential threat, placing it next in line, and frames the war as being aimed at the so-called ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, which includes Hezbollah, Iran and the Syrian regime. Moreover, the flow of foreign jihadis into the armed opposition constituted a genuine, long-term threat to Hezbollah. It declared a preemptive war against what it labels takfiris (Islamists who denounce others as infidels or impious), regardless of the differences and divergences among Syrian armed groups. In May 2013, Hezbollah publicly spearheaded an assault against Syrian rebels in the border town of Qusayr. In February 2014, Hezbollah sent its troops to the Qalamoun mountains north of Damascus and led the campaign to capture Yabroud, allegedly the transit hub for car bombs smuggled into Lebanon that targeted the party, Iranian assets and predominantly Shiite neighborhoods. The party's detractors accuse it of deploying fighters across Syria, in particular in Deraa, Aleppo and Idlib, in addition to Damascus and its suburbs. The result of this, however, has been that Hezbollah (""party of God"" in Arabic), once widely respected by Sunnis in Syria and the region for its military struggle against Israel, is now frequently dubbed the ""Party of Satan."" However extreme, this labeling reflects the depth of the shift. Hezbollah is being transformed by the conflict. Over many years, it meticulously built its reputation as an organization of principle. But it is now losing its hard-won soft power and growing more accustomed to relying on hard power to achieve its strategic objectives. The enmity this metamorphosis engenders is, ironically, fuelling the very same threats the party strives to repel. Its involvement ignites the extremism it is combatting as it deepens the regional sectarian rift. It also endangers its own strategic depth as it alienates wide segments of the Syrian population. Despite the fact that the Syrian regime's immediate survival is no longer at stake and Lebanese-Syrian borders largely secured, as party leader Hassan Nasrallah has affirmed, Hezbollah is not providing signs that it will withdraw from Syria anytime soon. Some among the movement's regional and wider international critics might see a silver lining in these developments: Hezbollah is mired in a war of attrition in Syria, fighting a determined and radical enemy, and is distracted from its traditional focus on Israel. But the same vortex is pulling in both Hezbollah and its enemies, with no prospect of escape for either. Nor will the critics relish the spread of the Shiite jihadism that, alongside a growing Sunni jihadism, the Syrian war is nurturing. This has grim implications for Lebanon, which depends for its well being on an always difficult balancing act among Shiites, Sunnis, Christians and Druze. Lebanon is holding itself together for now, through what is known as ""the security plan,"" but the respite is likely temporary. Lebanon's Sunnis are frustrated; Shiites, whose memories of oppression and marginalization are still vivid, are eager not to lose political and social gains they have acquired in the past decades; and other confessional groups are caught in the middle. The past two years' escalation - clashes in Tripoli, Saida and Arsal along with unprecedented waves of suicide attacks against Shiites - is only a foretaste of what could ensue if the security agreement breaks down. Lebanon has long lamented its political paralysis, the latest evidence of which is the leadership void as parliamentarians have failed repeatedly to agree on a new president. Yet, as the Syrian conflict deteriorates further, many Lebanese are hoping for just such a standstill - as a best-case scenario.Sahar Atrache is a Lebanon analyst for International Crisis Group, whose latest report is ""Lebanon's Hezbollah Turns Eastward to Syria."""

A gunman is in custody after four people were shot on campus resulting in one death. (Photo by Mat Hayward/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e7dd24000050005726a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I expected the shock of an earthquake--not a shooting. In fact, they're retrofitting our oldest building, Alexander Hall, to prevent earthquake damage. How do we retrofit Otto Miller Hall lobby, where yesterday's shooting took place? Erase the memories? Sure, we can remove the blood-stained carpet, paint the blood-splattered walls, clean up the shell casings. But the lobby, which I've walked through hundreds of times on my way to class, where I've casually picked up a free copy of the New York Times, where students gather to study and chat, will always be the place where ""the shooting"" happened. We'll always be that small Christian college in Seattle that had the shooting. The name will reverberate. Columbine. Virginia Tech. SPU. Yet this community is so much more than a now infamous acronym. Last night I sat with a group of students. The scheduled prayer service was packed, overflowing, so my wife Priscilla and I, both SPU faculty, were directed to a makeshift mass of students sitting in small groups in the evening light on The Loop, the central grassy area on campus, which sits less than a football field from Otto Miller Hall. Priscilla started us off in prayer with the words, ""Gracious God."" Then we mostly sat silent, bewildered. None of them, not one, asked God to make things right. They sat in grief.None of them, not one, found easy solutions. They sat in unknowing.None of them, not one, filled the air with clichés or cheap prayers. They sat in silence.We listened to other groups singing quietly their own songs. A few young women found the old hymn ""Be Still My Soul"" on their phone: Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side. Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain. Leave to thy God to order and provide; In every change, He faithful will remain. Be still, my soul: thy best, thy heavenly Friend Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.We must have sung six or seven verses, all slowly, all quietly, all prayerfully. But mostly we held hands, picked at the grass, wondered, grieved with each other, simply took time to breathe. A few of us read a smattering of scripture.The young man next to me read from Psalm 18: ""Out of my distress I called on the Lord.""I read from Lamentations: ""for God does not willingly afflict or grieve anyone.""A young woman read slowly, thoughtfully, from Ecclesiastes:  ""For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven ...  a time to be born, and a time to die;  a time to weep, and a time to laugh;  a time to mourn, and a time to dance ...  a time to keep silence, and a time to speak ..."" For everything there is a season.I am dumbstruck, dope-slapped by the ambiguity of it all. The mixed-up jumble of existence we call life. Priscilla's spiritual director from our Chicago days, Jane Koonce, told her, ""In consolation, remember desolation. In desolation, remember consolation."" We do. We have. Both.For everything there is a season. A time to weep and a time to laugh. A time to mourn and a time to dance. I understand the rhythm of this, the wisdom of it. Yet sometimes we have both, even when we're not sure which is which. Sometimes we weep and laugh at the same time. We mourn as we dance, dance as we mourn. Sometimes there is consolation during desolation, desolation during consolation.Consolation in desolation, desolation in consolation. Being given the chance, at fifty-seven, to sit with twenty-two year old students on a golden evening in a grassy collegiate quad--praying with them for people we don't even know, holding the hands of students whose exams I've graded or others I've just met, and caring, really caring, how they're doing. Is it callous to say I found consolation in desolation on that grassy quad with students I admire and cherish? These students were so reflective, comfortable in the silence, mature in their prayers for the shooter, the victims, our community. I didn't mean to or want to, but I felt hopeful. In four short years, just 120 weeks, these students, most of them seniors, had learned to live into ambiguity, had garnered a textured faith free of trivialities.I tell my students I teach for when they're forty, when they're black and blue. I'm honest with them about ambiguity and doubt and worries that pierce the hollow night. I'm honest with them, too, about faith. I'm still believing, still hoping, still laughing as I weep, weeping as I laugh, dancing as I mourn, mourning as I dance.Well, yesterday our campus turned forty. All of us. In the split seconds of text alerts and booming shots. In the sirens. In the cameras and news trucks. In the grassy quad. In the evening light. In prayer.A canal runs near the SPU campus, just on the other side of Otto Miller Hall. I've walked with countless students along that canal, talking about boyfriends and grammar and grad school and summer plans. Not far down the canal, you can watch the salmon return home to spawn. They're scarred, every last one of them, with scales missing, totems of hooks and bites engraved on their bodies. And they're still swimming. These are the salmon that survive, the ones that make it, the hope of the future.I'm not quite ready to talk hope. I believe in the resurrection of Jesus, yes. I believe in the life everlasting, as the creed puts it. But for now I grieve, as sad at dawn this morning as I was at dusk last night. Sad for the mothers and fathers, sisters, brothers, and friends grieving a lost son, urging a daughter back to life. But I confess, too, to a certain deep consolation--maybe it is hope after all--lying somewhere inside me next to that ball of grief, as I recollect the faces and faith of my students."
