2,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Going After 'Romney Loophole' And Other Tax Shelters,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-tax-wealthy_us_56953f9be4b09dbb4bacbf41,It's part of her plan to raise taxes on the rich.,2016-01-12,Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is expected to propose some ways to raise taxes on wealthy Americans.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56953fdd2a00002c000304da.jpeg?cache=WygPEyfx6d&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton has said she would raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, and on Tuesday she will propose two new ways of doing so.An aide to the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination tells The Huffington Post that Clinton will close what the campaign is calling the “Bermuda reinsurance loophole.” That’s a reference to a complex scheme in which investors set up insurance companies in low-tax countries such as Bermuda, then channel investment money through those companies to avoid paying higher taxes in the U.S. In addition, the aide said, Clinton will propose finding ways of taxing income that ultra-wealthy Americans now shelter in retirement accounts. Her campaign is referring to that proposal as closing the “Romney loophole” -- a reference to the revelation, during the 2012 presidential campaign, that Romney had managed to accumulate as much as $101.6 million in his tax-preferred retirement accounts.A 2014 study by the Government Accountability Office found that a small handful of very wealthy individuals, just 314, had accumulated individual retirement account balances of more than $25 million each. The GAO report noted, ""The accumulation of these large IRA balances by a small number of investors stands in contrast to Congress's aim to prevent the tax-favored accumulation of balances exceeding what is needed for retirement.""Both loopholes have attracted scrutiny before -- and not just from Democrats. Among those who have proposed addressing the Bermuda tax dodge, for example, are Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.). President Barack Obama has also proposed trying to recapture some of the tax money that the ultra-wealthy shelter in these ventures.This post has been updated to include information from a 2014 GAO study.Also on HuffPost:"

He also faces a separate obstruction of justice charge for falsifying his report.Last January, Scavone allegedly grabbed the neck of a woman identified only as ""A.O."" and threw her to the ground. He then struck her in the forehead with an open palm and slammed her head into the hood and door of his patrol car, according to a federal indictment out of Nevada. The indictment also alleges that Scavone knowingly falsified a document in connection with the arrest.Scavone was wearing a body cam as part of a pilot program, and footage from the incident was reviewed after the woman he arrested filed an internal complaint.Local authorities charged the former officer with misdemeanor battery back in March. But a Los Vegas detective reportedly recommended more serious charges against Scavone: oppression under color of law, which is a felony, as well as a misdemeanor charge of false reporting.The woman Scavone arrested, whom the officer suspected of engaging in prostitution, had been charged with littering and loitering, but those charges were dismissed. “You’re abusing me for no reason,” the woman allegedly said in footage captured by Scavone's body camera.The American Civil Liberties Union has praised Las Vegas authorities for their policy of making body camera footage available in most cases, but the footage of this incident has not yet been released.The civil rights charge Scavone is facing carries a maximum of 10 years in prison, while the obstruction count carries a maximum of 20 years. Scavone's lawyer, Josh Tomsheck, told The Huffington Post that the misdemeanor charge against his client hasn't been resolved, and that they have long been aware of the federal investigation into the incident.""Mr. Scavone looks forward to defending himself and having the full story come out in the court of law,"" Tomsheck said.

The Tesla chief told the BBC in an interview published Tuesday that it was an ""open secret"" that the tech giant was building a vehicle to compete with rival automakers. Reports of Apple's hiring frenzy over the past year have only fueled these expectations.Mission Motors, a maker of electronic motorcycles based in San Francisco, collapsed last year after Apple lured away some of its top engineers. Apple is also amassing a number of high-level execs to run what is assumed to be its electric car operation. Doug Betts, a veteran of Toyota, Nissan and the Chrysler Group, and Paul Furgale, a robotics specialist formerly at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, both joined the company last year.""It's pretty hard to hide something if you hire over a thousand engineers to do it,"" Musk told the BBC.Yet another hint of Apple's expansion into the auto market came last week, when news surfaced that the company had bought several car-related domain names, including apple.car.Musk, meanwhile, appears to be shrugging off suggestions that Apple's project could pose a threat to his company. He's previously called Apple a ""Tesla graveyard,"" referring to the company's history of hiring employees who have been fired by Tesla.Rivalries aside, Tesla and Apple are among the new wave of companies that are forcing traditional automakers to take a hard look at the way they produce vehicles. Musk, for example, has long championed a future with cars that no longer depend on environmentally damaging fossil fuels.Other firms are moving quickly into the electric car field. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, Faraday Future debuted a battery-powered concept car that could have up to 1,000 horsepower, and GM introduced an electric car that could go for 200 miles on one charge."
6,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Is Having A Good Week In Early Primary States,Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-january-polls-primary-2016_us_5695148fe4b086bc1cd52959,The competition is heating up.,2016-01-12,Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is polling ahead of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire and closely matched with her in Iowa.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569515081a00002d00ab057a.jpeg?cache=Alsmwk0wSb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New polls show that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is ahead of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire and gaining on her in Iowa, with early voting in both states less than a month away. Sanders now stands 14 percentage points ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, according to a Monmouth University poll of likely Democratic primary voters released Tuesday. Sanders' position has improved across all demographics since Monmouth last surveyed voters about two months ago, and he even has overtaken Clinton's lead among women.Fifty-two percent of those polled said they are firm in their decision at this point in the race -- but it's important to keep in mind that polls are still volatile.A Fox News poll conducted just days before the Monmouth poll shows Sanders with a 13-point lead over Clinton ahead of the primary but two others show him with a considerably smaller lead: An ARG poll finds him just 3 points ahead of the former secretary of state, while a NBC/WSJ/Marist poll has him leading her by 4 points. As Philip Bump of The Washington Post explains, some of the differences in these margins can likely be attributed to differences in polling methodology.Sanders and Clinton are polling at 50 and 44 percent, respectively, according to the HuffPost Pollster aggregate of New Hampshire polls. Polls show a neck-and-neck race in Iowa ahead of its caucus, with Sanders continuing to make significant gains. Sanders is polling at 49 percent and Clinton at 44 percent, according to a Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday. This represents a 9-point jump for the Vermont senator and a 7-point decline for Clinton since December.Similarly, an ARG poll released Monday shows him 3 points ahead. However, Democratic firm Public Policy Polling also released a poll on Tuesday finding Sanders, with 40 percent of the vote, stuck behind Clinton, who has 46 percent. Still, he has gained 6 points while she has lost an equal amount in a month's time, according to results from a December PPP poll. An NBC/WSJ/Marist poll conducted early this month found Sanders trailing Clinton by 3 points. The Iowa race is certainly competitive, with HuffPost Pollster's average of all publicly released polling data in the state showing Clinton standing just 4 points ahead of Sanders. Monmouth University, NBC/WSJ/Marist, ARG, Quinnipiac and Fox used live interviewers to call both landlines and cell phones to reach respondents. PPP conducted interviews using automated calling technology to landlines as well as contacting a smaller sample online.

7,POLITICS,4 Ways The State Of The Union Got Stronger Under Obama,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-state-union_us_5694941fe4b09dbb4bac6bc1,"There are still lots of problems, but things are getting better.",2016-01-12,Expect more smiles like this one when President Barack Obama gives his State of the Union address on Tuesday night. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5694949f1a00002e00ab0551.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama delivers his final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, and this speech won’t be like the ones he has given previously.In the past, Obama has used the address primarily to sketch out a specific, point-by-point agenda for the coming year. This time, aides have said, the president will be taking a broader view. That will mean, in part, taking stock of where he has taken the country in the last seven years. Obama is poised to make the case that the country is a better place than it was on his first Inauguration Day -- not perfect, for sure, but moving in the right direction.Republicans, who routinely call the Obama presidency a ""disaster,"" won’t believe it. And neither may most Americans, given that majorities consistently tell pollsters they think the U.S. is on the “wrong track.”But when it comes to four key areas of domestic policy -- the economy, health care, the federal budget and the environment -- Obama will have the better argument.THE ECONOMYThe economy was in free fall when Obama became president, shedding more than 800,000 jobs a month. One year later, the job market was growing again, and it has been ever since. The private sector has now been adding jobs for 70 consecutive months. That's a record. And last month the government's payroll report suggested a net gain of 292,000 jobs, which is a lot. (""Yabba dabba doo"" was how University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers responded to the news on Twitter.)One of the best ways to measure the job market is to use the employment-to-population ratio, and to focus exclusively on “prime age” workers -- that is, people between the ages of 18 and 54 -- in order to account for demographic effects, at least in part. That ratio fell through early 2010, leveled off for about a year, and then began a steady rise.It’s now at 77.2 percent. That is higher than it was when Obama took office, and higher still than it was a few months later, as the effects of the Great Recession were still rippling through the economy and before Obama’s economic policies could have any impact. It hasn’t reached its pre-recession peak but, then, it was a really, really bad recession. As Paul Krugman noted on Monday, presidents are rarely as responsible for economic performance as everybody thinks. Booms follow busts; that’s the nature of business cycle. But Obama’s policies certainly didn’t hurt the economy, as his critics predicted they would, and the Recovery Act helped -- by financing relief payments, filling empty state and local government coffers, financing infrastructure and giving tax breaks to the poor and middle class.The American economy still has major weaknesses. As organizations like the Economic Policy Institute have pointed out repeatedly, wages aren't rising that quickly. The poor and middle class have fallen way behind the rich. But average Americans have had stagnant incomes for basically three decades, except for a brief interlude during the 1990s boom. Obama's policies, which included higher taxes on the wealthy and more money for programs that help the working poor, at least mitigated the problem.HEALTH CAREConservatives say the Affordable Care Act has been a “train wreck.” That’s not consistent with the available evidence.As of last year, the percentage of nonelderly Americans without health insurance was 10.5 percent, according to the latest available statistics from the federal government’s National Health Insurance Survey. That’s not just lower than it was before the health care law took effect, and lower than it was at the beginning of Obama’s term -- that’s the lowest this survey has ever recorded.Insurance isn’t the same as access to care and plenty of people with coverage say they still struggle with medical bills, whether because insurance premiums are too high or because they can’t keep up with out-of-pocket expenses. But evidence from the NHIS and a large body of academic research, some recent and some older, suggest that overall access has improved because of the health care law.Meanwhile, overall health care costs were rising at historically low rates until last year, when, as predicted, the sudden expansion of insurance coverage bumped up consumption. Even with that bump, inflation looks nothing like the double-digit increases of previous years. Oh, and deadly hospital errors are on the decline. Experts disagree about what role the Affordable Care Act and other policy changes played in this improvement but, again, they certainly didn’t hurt and they probably helped.THE FEDERAL BUDGETThe deficit was soaring when Obama came into office, partly because the recession caused tax revenues to plunge and partly because the government deliberately passed new spending and tax cuts -- without offsetting revenue -- in order to stop the job losses and start a recovery. But the deficit peaked in 2009 and has been coming down ever since. As a percentage of gross domestic product, the deficit is now lower than it was in 2008.One way to appreciate the impact is to see how the projections of future deficits have changed since that time. One calculation by the Democratic staff of the Senate Budget Committee suggested that, between 2010 and 2014, deficit projections came down enough to save the government an extra $4.7 trillion over the course of the next decade.That figure alone doesn’t tell the whole story. One reason for the lower deficits is reduced spending on important investments in research and infrastructure. Over time, that could hurt the country more than the extra deficit spending would have. The 2014 figures also don’t reflect last month’s agreement to make some temporary tax cuts permanent. Even with the improvement, the country faces a serious long-term financing problem. Projections suggest the deficit will climb in future years, putting an ever greater strain on federal finances -- and, eventually, the economy. But things looked worse when Obama was first coming into office.THE ENVIRONMENTThe planet is still warming, but carbon emissions in the U.S. are declining. As with the economy and health care and the deficit, that reflects a whole bunch of factors, many of which have nothing to do with Obama. The recession, for example, played a role: When the economy slows down, both businesses and individuals end up consuming less energy, reducing the output of greenhouse gases.But government policies have likely helped. One place to see it is in the changes in fuel economy for vehicles, which the graph above shows. That reflects greater demand for efficient cars, obviously, but it also reflects tighter government requirements on mileage. Another is energy production from renewable energy sources -- which crept up slowly until around 2008, at which point it started climbing more quickly. Some of the improvement is a product of changes that predate Obama. But some are the result of policies he enacted, frequently over the strong objection of his critics.* * *By themselves, these things don’t mean that Obama’s presidency has been a success -- or that honest people on either end of the ideological spectrum can’t find legitimate grounds for criticisms. Plenty of liberals say Obama’s reforms haven’t done enough -- that unemployment could be even lower or wages could be higher, or that the changes to the health care system haven’t done enough to improve access and affordability. They look at the Recovery Act and the Affordable Care Act, along with the fiscal agreements that Obama made with the Republican Congress in later years, and see all kinds of concessions they think Obama didn't need to make.More conservative critics say the trade-offs of Obama’s policies -- bigger government, higher taxes -- have left the country worse off. They point out, for example, that many young and healthy people now pay higher premiums because insurers can't sell skimpy policies or base pricing on medical risk. As for the economy, they say it would be performing much better if not for Obama's new regulations on everything from emissions to the financial sector. And that’s to say nothing of foreign policy, where Obama's actions elicit equally passionate criticisms. But using some of the most basic, straightforward criteria about domestic policy, Obama can say honestly that the state of the union is strong -- or, at least, stronger than it was when he took office seven years ago.Also on HuffPost:"

Each time, he has declined to do so.Leading up to the president's last address Tuesday night, reformers are mostly resigned to the fact that the president will decline to announce any such plan. They do believe that he could lay the groundwork for an announcement on the sixth anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, which opened the door to unlimited corporate, union and, ultimately, individual spending on independent electoral efforts.“While I don’t think we’ll see groundbreaking policy announcements, I do think there will be foreshadowing for later,” said Lisa Gilbert, the director of Public Citizen’s Congress Watch.The president’s advisers, current and former, have weighed in on what could and should be in his final State of the Union.White House Chief of Staff Dennis McDonough stated that the speech will push for policies that allow “every American has a chance to influence this democracy, not the select few,” or “millionaires, billionaires.”Obama’s former top economic adviser, Gene Sperling, tweeted on Jan. 8 that the president should sign an executive order to reduce the amount of dark money funding elections.“We are confident President Obama is as appalled by the Citizens United decision today as indicated in his first State of the Union, perhaps more so given the grotesque displays of influence buying we’ve seen since,” said Common Cause Communications Director Scott Swenson. “In many ways democracy/political reform makes sense for the White House to lead on as voters start to turn their attention to choosing his successor.”A potential executive order came to light after the draft text of one was leaked to conservative lawyer and former Federal Election Commission member Hans Van Spokavsky in 2011. The order would have required all federal contractors to disclose all of their political donations, including those to nonprofits engaged in electoral campaigns that are not covered by disclosure laws, when submitting a bid. It was drafted after Congress failed to pass disclosure legislation in its previous session, failing to clear a Republican filibuster by a single vote.Business interests like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and conservative interest groups including those connected to the billionaire Koch brothers declared all-out opposition to the proposal. The chamber’s top lobbyist, Bruce Josten, said in 2011, “We will fight it through all available means.”Republicans in Congress have attempted to deny the White House the ability to issue the order through the appropriations process. Legislative language passed Congress that forbids the use of funds to enact or enforce an order requiring all federal contract bidders to disclose political spending. This language does leave open the possibility for the president to sign an order requiring contractors to disclose once they have secured the contract.Campaign finance reformers have been running a sustained campaign to get Obama to sign this executive order for years now. Their efforts have included the delivery of over 1 million signatures to the White House in support of the order, getting 26 Democratic senators to send a letter pressing Obama to sign the order, backing from The New York Times editorial page and vocal support from Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.So far, though, the president has only provided heartening words in prior speeches.In his 2015 State of the Union, Obama said, “A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter.”But there was no policy announcement to go along with the statement.Some reform backers have taken a harsher line on the president as his administration has failed to produce a policy to limit the amount of undisclosed money coursing through politics.The reform group RootStrikers launched a campaign to highlight Obama’s poor record on campaign finance reform. The group points out that Obama endorsed his very own super PAC in his 2012 reelection bid, and effectively killed the presidential public financing system by becoming the first candidate to refuse to participate in it during a general election in 2008.In support of the dark money executive order, RootStrikers and its partners have successfully obtained enough signatures to require a response from the White House through its “We the People” petition system. That response must come by Feb. 16.“We continue to hear the same rhetoric for his entire presidency -- that he detests the Citizens United decision, that it’s incredibly harmful to the country, and yet he’s done nothing,” RootStrikers Campaign Manager Kurt Walters said. “If he does not issue the executive order and continues to give the same empty rhetoric it will be a slap in the face to the millions of Americans he made promises to.”"

UFCW said it came to its endorsement decision after a series of meetings between union officials and internal polls of its members.With less than three weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, Clinton has already locked up endorsements from unions representing a solid majority of the nation's unionized workers. The biggest public sector unions have also thrown their weight behind the candidate -- including the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees -- along with the Service Employees International Union. UFCW says it is the largest private sector union in the country. Clinton said in a statement through her campaign that she was ""honored"" to have the union's backing. ""American workers built the greatest middle class in history by fighting for higher wages, safer working conditions, retirement security and the right to bargain collectively,"" she said. ""The UFCW has been there every step of the way.""In a tweet Monday afternoon, the union gave a nod to Clinton's rivals for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland Gov.

But many unions see Clinton as their best candidate in a general election with high stakes for unions and their allies.Marc Perrone, UFCW's president, said in a statement that the union's members ""deserve a president like Hillary Clinton who will fight to make sure that paid leave, stable schedules, and higher wages become more than an election promise.""The biggest labor endorsement of all, from the AFL-CIO union federation, has not been made yet and probably won't come during a contested Democratic primary.Also on HuffPost:"

You’re one of the people who have to watch the State of the Union from somewhere far away, in case -- God forbid -- some unspeakable tragedy happens in the House chamber.It’s not a small task. The president, as is custom, will designate his own survivor for the occasion, selecting someone from his Cabinet. And while that person inevitably becomes the butt of jokes about how low they rank on the totem pole, the job is quite serious. In 2010, Nick Shapiro, then Obama’s spokesman, was tasked with staffing that year’s designated survivor -- Shaun Donovan, at the time the secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Donovan and Shapiro, along with others, jumped into a military helicopter, went to an undisclosed location and followed a set of finely scripted procedures that kind of put a chill in the ol' spine.“He took it very seriously. And we did a practice basically, where I remember writing draft talking points for him in case something went wrong, what he would say,” said Shapiro. “I had never met him before and he said, 'Oh, so you'll be my Robert Gibbs [the president’s then-press secretary].' It was very exciting but also, of course, serious at the same time, since we were talking about a situation that would be unfathomable.”Since 2005, Congress has also had its own designated survivor for the purposes of forming a ""rump legislature” in lieu of horrible tragedy. (No, we don't know why it's called that, either.) This explains the Hatch scuttlebutt.But this recent development has struck constitutional scholars as, well -- a bit odd. Norm Ornstein, an expert on these matters and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, noted that Congress can’t actually operate without a quorum and that the Constitution defines a quorum as half the members.“So if somehow the president and the vice president and everybody else was there [at the State of the Union], and the whole thing got blown up, you wouldn’t have a Congress for a very long period of time,” Ornstein explained. “You would be able to reconstitute the Senate very quickly because almost all states have provisions to appoint vacancies. But you wouldn’t have a House for a very long time, because you fill those posts for a special election.”In this nightmare scenario, in essence, Hatch would be a congressional lawmaker without a Congress. But then there are other constitutional provisions that could result in Hatch not even remaining a member of Congress at all.Under the doomsday hypothetical in which the House chamber is blown up Tuesday night -- taking the lives of Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) -- Hatch would be in line for the presidency as president pro tempore of the Senate.

Now, Trump's at it again, this time questioning the citizenship of Canadian-born Republican presidential rival Ted Cruz. A new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds that 53 percent of Republicans still doubt Obama's citizenship. At the same time, an overwhelming 70 percent don't have any doubt Cruz is American and eligible to be president. More interestingly, most of the Republicans who don't think Obama was born in America aren't concerned about Cruz's citizenship. Sixty-four percent think Cruz is eligible to become president, while just 18 percent think he's not. Another 18 percent are not sure. Experts believe Cruz wouldn't face any legal challenges to becoming president. Cruz was born in Calgary to an American mother and Cuban father, which most say makes him a ""natural born citizen,"" a status that meets the requirements of the Constitution. Other findings from the poll reveal that, overall, Republicans overwhelmingly side with Cruz over Trump on the issue and believe the senator could be president, despite being born in Canada. Just 21 percent of Republicans side with Trump and agree that Cruz's birth could cause a problem if he were the Republican nominee. Another 21 percent are not sure about the situation. In an interview with The Washington Post last week, Trump drew attention to Cruz's birthplace and suggested it could be a ""very precarious"" issue for Republicans.“Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question: ‘Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years?’ That’d be a big problem,” Trump said.Since then, Trump has continued to bring up concerns about Cruz's citizenship.Cruz made light of Trump's comments by tweeting a clip from an episode of the old sitcom ""Happy Days"" in which the character Fonzie jumps over a shark while on water skis, a moment that spawned the phrase used to refer to something once good that begins to decline.HuffPost Pollster, which combines publicly available polling data, shows Cruz is neck-and-neck with Trump in the key primary state of Iowa. In New Hampshire, Cruz is in third place. The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 9-11 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

14,ARTS & CULTURE,Artist Makes Apologizing Cool Again With Fluffy Pompoms,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/apomogy-rachel-burke-apologizing_us_568fcaa6e4b0a2b6fb6fa94f,Loving these pompoms means never having to not say you're sorry.,2016-01-12,"Each plush, handmade pom pom carries an anonymous apology, from ""I'm sorry I cheated on you"" to ""I’m sorry I’ve stolen your fries while you weren’t looking every fast food meal for the last three and a half years.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56900dbe1a00003f00594285.jpeg?cache=BgTfoSxGfJ&ops=crop_0_254_2448_1915%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale,"Apologizing isn't very in right now. Saying ""I'm sorry"" can seem like an unnecessary admission of shame. People want to be ""unapologetic"" about their choices; they want to refuse to say ""sorry"" for who they are.Compulsive apologizing has often been attributed to harried, ground-down women, who feel compelled to gasp ""sorry!"" after a man steps on her foot. A new plug-in for Chrome has even been designed to encourage women to stop apologizing and consider how apologetic language undermines their authority.Australian textile artist Rachel Burke has a more positive view of apologies, and her new project, ""Apomogy,"" aims to make us see them in a more appreciative light. Since September, Burke has been urging people to send her handmade pompoms attached to apologies for the project she calls ""Apomogy."" Participants can also send in apologies online, which she will write out and attach to one of her own pompoms for the collection. ""I’d say around 20 percent of the current apomogy project consists of pompoms made by 'Apomogy' contributors,"" Burke told The Huffington Post via email.Apomogy superficially resembles another submission-based concept project: PostSecret. The apologies aren't sent to the true recipients, but to Burke, for anonymous publication. Still, some apologies can't be contained. ""I have since seen on social media that people are publicly giving apomogies they have made to people who they feel deserve them,"" admits Burke, ""so it has taken on a life of its own in that respect.""Burke shared what ""Apomogy"" has taught her about saying sorry, the courage of being apologetic, and, of course, many adorable photos of woolly pompoms:Would you like to see ""Apomogy"" spread into general use, or do you think the value is purely conceptual, as an art project?I think the apomogy project has shown that it has both conceptual value and the potential for wider social resonance. From an artistic perspective, the project is mainly conceptual. I am exploring what it means to apologize, seeking insight into what people are sorry for, and hoping to provoke thought, reflection and discussion. However, it can’t be denied that some participants in this project want to take their apomogies outside of the confines of the art project and actually use them as a catalyst for a verbal, or at least sincere, apology to take place. I think there is real value in people communicating honestly and being true to how they feel, with or without a pompom to help them.I know you’re a fabric artist, and the pompoms are one form of that, but there’s also a strong feminine association with both soft, cuddly yarn balls and with the submissiveness of apologizing. Do you have any thoughts on the gender associations at play here?As the pompoms are made of wool, they are inherently soft and colorful, but I don’t think that this makes their connotations strictly feminine. Anyone can make a pompom, just like anyone can make an apology, regardless of their gender. Apologizing is a universal experience and it is almost unavoidable to become vulnerable when making one, irrespective of whether you’re male or female. While it seems that society at times associates the act of apologizing with female submissiveness, weakness or a general lack of backbone, I feel that apologizing actually requires strength and courage.In one article I read about your project, the writer actually mentioned the current cultural push to get women to apologize less, including a new app that notifies women if they're using words such as ""sorry"" too much in emails. What do you think about these anti-apology messages toward women?This new app, and cultural push to stop people (particularly women) from saying sorry, is really interesting to me, but also bothers me at the same time. I can see the sentiment behind Tami Reiss’ app and appreciate her desire to empower women, particularly in the workplace, but I don’t think that these issues are going to be solved by training women to speak in a certain way so that they are not perceived as weak. Instead, I can’t help but wonder if the broader issue is that language used by women is perceived in a certain way, and whether we ought to tackle those biases (conscious and unconscious) rather than have them write in a more ""masculine"" or socially acceptable way. On some level, I feel that the app shifts the focus from the real issues at hand, but I also applaud the fact that it has us all talking about this issue as a whole. In short, I feel that all people should be encouraged to express themselves in a way that comes naturally to them, and not be considered unworthy for doing so ... even if it does mean they might apologize too much in the process.How has this project affected you as you've worked on it? Have any of the apologies you've received weighed on you emotionally or influenced your thinking about the project?The apomogies I receive each day never fail to astound me. The diversity in the subject matter is vast, and they have made me laugh and cry in equal measure. I began this project after making some big apologies of my own last year; however, I’ve since also been the direct recipient of an apomogy which has touched me deeply. A few weeks ago I opened the apomogy inbox and found an email from a high school friend who I haven’t seen or spoken to after a falling out almost seven years ago. The apomogy simply read: ""I’m sorry we’re not friends anymore,"" and was accompanied by a detailed letter from my friend outlining her feelings and saying that she had never known how or when to get in touch with me, but that something about this project inspired her to find the words.I never expected that something like this would happen when I began the project, and it has definitely made me think more about the power of a sincere apology. The process has also made me think about the depth of feeling that may actually sit behind seemingly simple apologies and the weight that making one can take off our shoulders. While some may say that only thoughtful and considerate people would ever make an apomogy, I’ve learned to give greater thought to the fact that we so often do not know what is going on in other people’s lives and the thoughts, feelings and regrets that they may be carrying around with them.Also on HuffPost:"

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives passed a bill Monday night that would extend new protections to unpaid interns in the federal government, a vote that bodes well for the legislation's chances in the Senate.The bill would close a loophole in federal law that carves unpaid interns out of the Civil Rights Act. Current law does not acknowledge unpaid interns as employees, leaving them without remedies if they encounter discrimination based on race, sex, age or religion. The proposed legislation would allow unpaid interns to sue the government in federal court if their rights were violated.The Democratic-sponsored bill passed a voice vote in the GOP-controlled House on Monday night, putting it in the hands of the Senate, which is also controlled by Republicans.Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), a sponsor of the bill, described it as ""commonsense legislation that should have become law long ago.""""Allowing this kind of behavior to go unchecked can have serious consequences on the lives and careers of young people interested in government service, and I am encouraged that the House passed our bill with unanimous support,"" Cummings said in a statement.The bill is one of a trio introduced by Democrats looking to extend civil rights protections to unpaid interns in all U.S. workplaces. The other two would apply to unpaid interns working in congressional offices and to the private sector at large. The bills are being pushed by Cummings and Reps. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Grace Meng (D-N.Y.)The legislation aimed at private businesses would clearly have the biggest impact, as well as the tallest hurdles to overcome. Republicans in both chambers have been reluctant to impose any new regulations on businesses, particularly ones that can lead to lawsuits from workers. Scott said Monday that, given the passage of the federal portion of the legislation, he was calling on leadership of the Education and the Workforce Committee to take up the private-sector companion bill.Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) plans to introduce a companion to Cummings' bill in the Senate, according to House Democrats.The lack of protections for federal unpaid interns was brought to light by a youth advocacy group called Young Invincibles, which has lobbied lawmakers on the issue since 2014. Reid Setzer, the group's policy analyst, called the bill's passage Monday ""an important first step"" to ensuring workplaces are ""safe and healthy environments"" for interns.Also on HuffPost:"

Some, including TV host Bonnie Bernstein and sports writer Jason Whitlock, posted on Twitter to express their distaste for Ciara's outfit: Inappropriate? Nudity? As Twitter user @FUCCI pointed out below, also on the football field that evening were cheerleaders dressed in sparkly two pieces, arguably as revealing as Ciara's gown.At the end of the day, neither the cheerleaders nor Ciara should be shamed for what they were wearing. The fact that people would rather focus on Ciara's cleavage than on her musical talent in that moment is just a further example of a sexist double standard that holds women to ridiculous standards of respectability.

To carve out space for the new stuff, the company is rerouting the Disneyland Railroad, shortening the Rivers of America and likely shrinking Tom Sawyer Island.On Monday, Disneyland released concept art showing what the revamped riverfront will eventually look like:As the image shows, the new riverfront will feature several waterfalls and a trestle for the Disneyland Railroad running along it. While the river will be shorter, all of the rides that run along it will return, including the Mark Twain, the Sailing Ship Columbia and Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes, the company said on its official blog.But for now, those attractions and the railroad will be closed for at least a year while the river is partially drained and the construction work gets under way. The ""Fantasmic"" nighttime show, which takes place on the river, is also on hiatus. The new ""Star Wars"" themed area will take over what had been the Big Thunder Ranch, which included a petting zoo and an outdoor BBQ restaurant. Disney is also creating a ""Star Wars"" area at Walt Disney World in Florida. While few details have been released, the company said in its August announcement that each land will have two ""signature"" attractions, ""including the ability to take the controls of one of the most recognizable ships in the galaxy, the Millennium Falcon, on a customized secret mission, and an epic Star Wars adventure that puts guests in the middle of a climactic battle.""It's a safe bet there will also be some merchandise for sale.

""Our hunt for David’s successor has been exhaustive, and we were privileged to have had extraordinary candidates from both inside and outside The Times,"" Executive Editor Dean Baquet and Business Editor Dean Murphy wrote in a staff memo. ""Jim brings to the job a passion for the story, a track record in covering the industry and the experienced eye of an astute observer.""The Times began searching for Carr's successor last spring, speaking early on to writers from New York magazine, Vanity Fair and NPR, as well as journalists inside the paper. But Carr's legacy, as one of the paper's most incisive writers and as a leading ambassador for Times' journalism, prompted editors to be especially deliberate in making a final decision.HuffPost reported in November that Rutenberg, most recently New York Times Magazine's chief political correspondent, was a contender, but the process was clearly far from over. In the memo, Baquet and Murphy wrote that Rutenberg -- a former media reporter for The Times and the New York Observer -- is ""returning to his media roots."" They recalled his past reporting on the emergence of Fox News and Dan Rather's retracted ""60 Minutes"" report on George W. Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard. More recently, Rutenberg wrote a Times Magazine cover story on Fox News star Megyn Kelly. ""That sound you hear is the keening and wailing on the sixth floor,” Times Magazine editor Jake Silverstein is quoted as saying in the memo. “Jim came to the magazine just a couple years ago, but in that short time he's established himself as one of the sharpest longform political writers in the country.

Don't go to work. Your symptoms are evolution's way of telling you to stay home and not get other people sick, according to research publicized last week by Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science.The research, which first appeared in October at the journal PLOS Biology, suggests that the physical feeling of sickness may be an evolutionary adaptation to alert us that it's time to isolate ourselves from the herd.The paper's authors list a series of symptoms that all seem geared toward separating the individual from their larger social group, including losing your appetite (which creates a smaller chance that you'll contaminate the group's food), fatigue and weakness (making you less likely to get out of bed and interact with the community), and lack of interest in sexual contact (which speaks for itself). These behavioral symptoms that accompany sickness don't do anything to help the individual's chances of survival and reproduction, the researchers argue. So why have they persisted?The researchers posit that ""sickness behavior"" is an evolutionary adaptation meant to limit the spread of disease. While the individual may not survive the illness, by isolating himself from the social group, he or she will reduce the overall infection rate within the community. It's worth noting that we aren't the only species to do this: Bees also exhibit ""sickness behavior"" when they're ill, abandoning the hive to die elsewhere.""We think it's an altruistic behavior -- you do it not for yourself but for your relatives,"" Dr. Guy Shakhar, an immunologist at the Weizmann Institute and the paper's co-author, told The Huffington Post.While most infections aren't a question of life or death for modern humans, this theory does still have an application in today's world, where it has become routine to cover up the symptoms of sickness with drugs. ""We tend to still go to work when we're sick, or give our children some Tylenol and send them off to school, so they get over their sickness behaviors and go on to infect somebody else,"" Shakhar said. ""I'm not saying to stop taking the anti-inflammatory drugs when you're sick, but be aware that just because the sickness behaviors are gone it doesn't mean you're not infectious.""That's right: If you have a cold, evolution is telling you not to go to work. You can always tell your boss that staying home is the way our human ancestors intended it. "

Back in December, it was reported that the film featured a rape scene between the bear and DiCaprio. When that rumor was shut down, people everywhere were likely relieved, but the bear apparently wasn't finished with his 15 seconds fame. During Sunday night's Golden Globe Awards, the bear made an appearance while presenting the award for Actress in a Supporting Role to Kate Winslet. Well, kind of. It was actually Jonah Hill wearing a bear head (not even a full costume), but he tried.Of course, all the action was caught on camera and made its way 'round the Twitterverse. Jane Fonda, along with the rest of the Internet, was not impressed. Let's hope he keeps that bear head locked up for the Oscars. Also on HuffPost: "

Andrew Brewer and Officer Joshua Wood, from the Westampton Police Department in New Jersey, responded to a call last Monday at a hotel where a mother from Massachusetts, who was recently diagnosed with cancer, had stayed the night with her children, according to a Facebook post.The mother had fallen asleep while doing laundry at the hotel's public laundry room and when she woke up, she found that the family's clothes, including their winter gear, had been stolen. Brewer, who has kids himself, decided to protect and serve in the kindest way possible and took the mom and her kids to a nearby Target store and helped them shop for clothing to replace what they'd lost. The kind act was documented in an adorable photo of Brewer with the family on Facebook. ""She was very ecstatic about it,"" Brewer told NJ.com of mother's reaction to the helping hand she received. ""She was overwhelmingly happy and grateful for us coming to her need and helping her in this incident.""According to a Facebook post from the police department, the family was left with only their pajamas to wear back to Massachusetts. When the law enforcement members arrived at the scene, the mother was ""distraught."" As a parent, Brewer said he felt for the mom and her family. ""I put myself in her position, having children of my own, and [realized] how distraught and upset I would be,"" he told NJ.com. So Brewer arranged for an anonymous donor to contribute funds for the family. Brewer then took the family to Target so they could get what they needed. Brewer's colleagues are proud of his actions and say that he's exemplified what it means to be a good member of law enforcement. ""Sgt. Brewer’s actions demonstrated that the most effective piece of equipment that an officer has is his own human heart,"" Lt. Roger J. Rogers told The Huffington Post. ""When you base your decisions on that, you’re more likely to do what’s right.""The Westampton Detective Division is currently investigating the theft. Also on HuffPost: "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5693cdc01a00002d00594410.jpeg?cache=oGRkgjkb4G&ops=crop_17_146_1983_1457%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- New Republic owner Chris Hughes announced Monday he's selling the liberal politics and policy magazine nearly four years since purchasing it and after overseeing sweeping changes that resulted in two top editors resigning, a staff exodus and a couple of relaunches. ""After investing a great deal of time, energy, and over $20 million, I have come to the conclusion that it is time for new leadership and vision at The New Republic,"" Hughes, a Facebook co-founder worth an estimated $700 million, told staff in a memo obtained by The Huffington Post. In the memo, Hughes said the staff has ""made good progress in reinvigorating this institution,"" which launched just over a century ago. He touted the magazine's journalism and business moves, such as building a brand marketing studio and launching a faster website.""We have made it possible for The New Republic to survive and begin to flourish in its second century,"" he wrote. However, Hughes said that he ""underestimated the difficulty of transitioning an old and traditional institution into a digital media company in today's quickly evolving climate."" He also questioned whether The New Republic, which had historically lost money before Hughes took over, could find a sustainable business model. ""There are bright signs on the horizon: Vox, Vice, the Texas Tribune, Buzzfeed, ProPublica, and Mic embody a new generation of promising organizations -- some for-profit, others non-profit -- that have put serious, high-quality journalism at the core of their identities,"" Hughes wrote. ""The New York Times, The Atlantic, and other traditional outlets seem to have found business models that work for them. I hope that this institution will one day be part of that list. To get there The New Republic needs a new vision that only a new owner can bring.""Hughes has spoken to major media companies, startups and political activists about possibly buying the magazine, according to a source familiar with the discussions.In addition, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has a minority stake in the magazine, will also sell his shares as part of any transaction, according to the source.Ackman was once a student of Marty Peretz, a former Harvard professor who bought the magazine in 1974 and owned it for more than three decades. In 2009, Ackman joined a consortium of investors, along with Peretz, who bought the magazine back, only to sell a few years later to Hughes. Ackman is the only consortium member to still own shares.Ackman spokesman Fran McGill declined to comment. The New Republic, an influential liberal magazine that had also been a staunch backer of the Iraq War, went on the market in 2012. Several media suitors kicked the tires before Hughes, 32, emerged as the buyer. He took the helm in March 2012, and in his first editorial meeting, pledged to uphold the magazine's traditions. He brought back former top editor Franklin Foer two months later and expressed ambitions for The New Republic to be mentioned in the same breath as The New Yorker. He tried recruiting big-name journalists from outlets like The Atlantic and The New York Times Magazine. Hughes oversaw a relaunch of the print magazine in early 2013, but the first newly designed issue proved controversial. Initially, editors were planning to feature a cover story by journalism Steven Brill on America's dysfunctional health care system, but instead opted for an interview Hughes and Foer conducted with President Barack Obama. Brill, whose 24,000-word piece later ran in Time magazine and won a National Magazine Award, called Hughes a ""liar"" for having committed to run the piece in the relaunch issue. While Hughes initially seemed committed to the magazine's traditions of long-form journalism and cultural criticism, staffers began to fear that he and CEO Guy Vidra were more focused on boosting web traffic and transitioning the century-old magazine into a technology company.A rift developed between Hughes and Vidra on one side and Foer and longtime culture editor Leon Wieseltier on the other. The clashing visions were on display at The New Republic's centennial celebration in November 2014, and just weeks later, both Foer and Wieseltier resigned -- followed by dozens of editorial staffers and contributing editors. The New Republic relocated its headquarters from Washington to New York, where Hughes lives, and again relaunched the print magazine in February under the stewardship of editor Gabriel Snyder and with a largely new staff. Hughes told The New York Times at the time that he was thinking in terms of years when it came to The New Republic's transition toward the future. “One of the key things is trying to create a culture of innovation around here,” he said. “But that takes time. There’s no shot clock.”Read Hughes' full memo to staff:To the staff of The New Republic,This article has been updated with information about The New Republic's possible buyers and Bill Ackman's stake in the magazine.
